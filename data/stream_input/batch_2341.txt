B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is very helpful when doing my math homework. I don't really enjoy how you cant put in fractions(at least I don't think you can). but other than that, its really good
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This is a fun game and it makes you think backwards.  This makes for some interesting strategy while trying to figure out where the mouse is going next.
B00005UNCL|1.0|I saw Jurassic Park when I was 16. Having loved dinosaurs as a kid the experience was mind blowing. I returned to the theater 5 more times that summer to see it. I've read the book every summer since. When the second book came out I ran to buy and devoured it. When the trailers for the sequel started coming out in 1997 I was excited to see it. When I finally saw it, I was speechless for days. Horrified. Heartbroken. There were big changes from the book in the first film, but the heart of the book is there. This film has next to nothing to do with the book. Taking dinosaurs of the island turned it into a dumb monster movie. This was the most disappointed I ever was in a movie, until 1999 of course.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|A friend recommended this game to me. No matter how many times I lose it keeps me coming back. Overall great game
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I bought this CD as a birthday gift for my husband.  It was a big hit.  After listening to it, I will be getting one for myself.  My Favorite song is &#34;The Whippoorwill.&#34;  However, the whole CD is GREAT.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I definitely think this &#34;kind of a sequel&#34; to Knocked Up is more geared towards parents, but I found it hilarious.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Given the amount of sales & awards of this album, who doesn't love this offering from Adele? I know of no one. Song energy, lyrics, voice, is just marvelous & worthy of the awards received!
B008Y73940|5.0|I gave it a 5 star rating because of the great acting and storyline. I  especially liked the idea of the defense attorney seeking justice, rather than getting a victory at all costs.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this series tremendously, in every possible way. I had seen ads for this & movie, & the subject matter just turned me completely off. Then one day, I get a call from my daughter, telling me, no less, about this book series she read & how fantastic it was & begged me to get it & read it, that it wasn't what I thought!! I did, & SO THANKFUL to her for getting me to do so. The suspense, character development, story line, & putting the reader right in the action is superb!
0061692034|5.0|Richard Ford is an amazing writer. He had me from the opening lines. Great story set in an area unknown to most American's..

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait for season 4 to come out!!!  Recommend to everyone for viewing. you won't regret it. My brother convinced me to watch it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've never taken the time to write a review before...but I also haven't encountered a book that so deeply deserves 5 stars!!! Silo did!!!<br /><br />I was drawn into this series and literally could not put it down. In talking ran my kindle battery to the ground down!<br /><br />Loved it and highly recommend to others!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. It has brilliant ideas and graphics. I think that its amazing how the game changes places and therefore changes trains and the guts chasing you. It's also good because you can collect people.
B0053O89WY|5.0|the big bang theory is one of my all time favorite sitcoms-and this fifth season is just as funny as the first four-sheldon is the drawing card for me but still it wouldn't be the same without leonard,raj,penny and howard-together they have made a show that will be a classic for many decades to come
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game and it's really fun. And you even get to go to different city's so fun
B002L5GQGY|1.0|COULDN'T BE BETTER! ON TIME, BRAND NEW, EVERYTHING THEY SAID THEY DID.<br />JERRY<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY OF THIS DVD WAS CLEAR, AS WAS THE VISUAL
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I resisted getting into this series for 3 seasons.  I finally gave in on a  night when I could not sleep.  I was drawn in and hooked on the first episode.  I cannot imagine anyone not enjoying this series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|To author a book of this caliber must have been daunting, but George R. R. Martin never faulters. Page by page you find allegiances, treachery, triumph and loss, never able to count on what is known or expected. The hero doesn't always win all  in the calculated strategy and struggle that is the game of thrones.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I usually don't &#34;get into&#34; such stories, but my wife and I both love this series.  Exceptionally well done, but didn't expect the plot to develop as it has.  We look forward to the next season.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The first. Book was better but if you had not read the first book then do so or u will be lost
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a great book, with lots of action and adventure. I can't wait to read the next one, The Mark of Athena!
B001AQMBNC|3.0|There was also a series made from this movie. This is more drama than action or sci-fi. The SFX were cutting edge for its time and still look decent today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game subway surfer is an excellent games because it never comes to an end<br />its great fun for the whole family especially when you play online<br /> with other people

B004SEUJW8|3.0|I like the digital copies because not only can I use it on my appletv but I can also take it on my portable players without having to take the disc with me. What is incredibly disappointing is the fact that now the digital copies do not have the DTS audio sound that Sony brags about is included with ALL blueray media!!! I noticed this with the newest digital copies of X-men, ( all versions/sequels ) that I only can play it in standard stereo and no option is given to turn on DTS audio or even THX!! What a rip! I only bought the digital copies so I can play them from my Appletv and Mac with my surround receiver without having to insert the blueray copy into my player every time. ( It takes longer for the movie to bootup and the ridiculous anti piracy policy, as if that is going to stop a thief from violating the protection. ) The movie itself is an good action flick, which I am sure everyone by now, knows. But if Sony blueray & digital copies are not going to have the promised DTS/THX audio included, what's the perk? Better picture quality? Yeah, right. As if. Specially with action movies, the sound quality is what really makes the experience enjoyable!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My daughter loves this game on my kindle.  She plays it all the time.  I can't use my kindle as often because she's always cutting someone's hair on Toca Hair Salon.  Which is great, since she no longer cuts her own hair. :)
0684874350|1.0|This has to be the worst book i've read in a while.  To me it was boring and uninteresting, from beginning to end. I belong to a book club and this was the reading.  This was only reason I managed to finish it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Nice to see intellect tv at this level of excellent. Rent all three and and fall in love with this scandalous fun.
B000E97HIA|5.0|In 2004, Prince released Musicology. The album sold extremely well and earned Prince various Grammy nominees and wins. It also helped that he went on a world tour to support the album. It was the comeback many of us fans were waiting for, and Prince was hot once again (although the singles were not chart toppers, Prince had received lots of attention during this period because of the album and the controversial Cinnamon Girl video) It also helped that it was his best album since 1995's The Gold Experience.<br /><br />Many of us wondered how Prince could follow up on that album. After all, with Prince writing at his own pace here, and without Warner Bros. drilling, he could have again faded into obscurity.<br /><br />In 2006, he released 3121, and you know what? The album debuted #1 on the Billboard 200 Hot Albums chart! This was a first in his career, and his first #1 album since 1989's Batman. Instead of following Musicology's organic sound, Prince pretty much modernized the Minneapolis sound, in some extent. Instead of using the classic Linn drums and 80's keyboards,  he used modern 21st century instruments and at the same time adding his own mix to it. What makes it even better is that he is not following the music scene in order to be popular like in 1991's Diamonds & Pearls. Although I enjoyed the hits off of that album, it was him basically following the music scene, which I hate to admit.<br /><br />However, in this album, he sounds fresh and full of energy. There really isn't a bad song on the album, and some of the ballads like Te Amo Corazon, Satisfied & The Dance rank among some of his nicest and tenderest, thanks to the production and the quality of the lyrics and music.<br /><br />He hits some great Pop songs such as Black Sweat and Love, great rock such as Fury, awesome jazz with Satisfied. There is a variety of styles included in this album, but somehow, it all manages to stay with the flow.<br /><br />He also manages to wink at the old time fans, with the title track (3121) featuring his sped up Camille alter-ego/voice.<br />It was cool to be a fan during this period as Prince actually got airplay on the radio (and quite frequently as well) Satisfied still plays sometimes on my local Jazz station here in my city.<br /><br />this is a fun album and I think that you should buy it. It's a shame he couldn't keep up after this, releasing the meh/so-so/adequate Planet Earth.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This series is very well written, produced, directed and acted.<br />Worth the price to get it on Amazon Prime.<br />Still waiting for season 2.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|It's just that simple, if you're a Horror fan that's been bored and unimpressed by Horror movies for too long then this is your flick! And Jessica Chastain's sweet sweet ass don't hurt either. lol
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I wished I'd live there in wades shoes. When he claimed the rewards for finishing it. Also I wish the oasis was real it would<br />Be where I spent my time instead of the Xbox or PlayStation or computer etc.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I just read this book on holidays. It was gripping! I could not put it down. Liane Moriarty has a great talent for building characters and weaving stories that hook the reader. Highly recommended.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I highly recommend you read this if you're a spiritual seeker. You may already be awakening, as I was, when I learned of this book. This will confirm and also teach you more of your journey.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I was very surprised by this book. All the previous 3 I couldn't put down and read fairly quickly but this one I had a very hard time getting into and could only read a few pages at a time. Towards the end I finally got into it but he took me about 8 months to read, putting it down for weeks at a time. George R.R. Martin let me down. A lot of my favorite characters were missing & there were a bunch of new ones I could've gone without!!
0062014536|4.0|I just wish there were another book after this one. Wanted a little more closure than it offered. Otherwise, I love the characters and the storyline. I really enjoyed it overall.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The biggest complaint about this game is that it's boring. Or slow. Or that you have to actually wait for things to happen. To me it's a great lesson in patience for my son. The anticipation or something great MAYBE happening. And anticipating something, and not getting the hoped result. And the excitement of waiting a full day for something and then it happens and we hi five and get excited. It's a great game to teach the &#34;instant gratification generation&#34; that great things are worth waiting for, and sometimes you can't always get what you want. I love this game...
B001NLKT60|4.0|So I borrowed this series and was only reading it because it was so widely acclaimed...now I understand why!<br />The writing is amazing...it is a shame that the author has died because I think that he could have been a rock star.<br />The story was great and explains a lot...but leaves you wanting so much more!!  I'm glad have book three and have already started to read that one too.<br />The only issue I've had was that the places are unfamiliar to me since I've never been Sweden (maybe one day...) but that is it.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Watches it at least 1 times everyday! She is only 14 months old and will sit in front of the TV and watch it all.
B0036EH3WK|4.0|My only regret is that I waited till the final season to buy this. I watched all the other seasons on Netflix. And finished the series off with the blu-ray package
B0063GORYU|5.0|I loved the graphics. I have played a lot of different versions and this is easily my favorite moves fast and doesn't get hung up on details.
B00448SE4S|5.0|this is a multi-generational blast.  from grandparents to grandchildren, in our family this is one we love to enjoy together.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|accurate portrayal of married life and relationship after 11 years of marriage and two kids. very funny, but makes you regret how much you take for granted.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|you won't be disappointed. fun, entertaining and most definitely harlarious. my family and I love the laughter it generates. enjoy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't have asked for anything better. I love it ! Just hoping the third is just as exciting. (*Fingers crossed*)
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Try reading this book not getting excited to strap your shoes on and just run. Amazingly informative and engaging read.  Scott is an extremely humble and incredible runner.  This book will remind you why you love to run!
B0054W4JQK|5.0|I really could not put this psychological thriller down... just as well it isn't a really  long book! Christine suffers from amnesia, but of a special kind. She rarely remember anything of her past and new memories she has formed each day, disappear through the night when she is asleep, so each day she awakens unable to work out where she is, who the man in the bed beside her is and why her hands look so old until she sees her face in the bathroom mirror and sees the photos and the notes around the mirror explaining who she is and that the man is her husband Ben.<br />She begins to see a doctor in secret, and he encourages her to keep a private journal as a way of recording the fleeting memories she has so she can revisit them and perhaps help recover more memories. As she starts to record events, she begins to realise that Ben is lying to her, but cannot work out his motivation in doing so, if the lies are intended to protect her, or him.<br />This novel was enthralling, with each new discovery, sometimes contradicting past memories, you begin to wonder how many of her memories are real and how many are delusions, and why Ben has kept so many events from her past secret.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I've always liked Mad Season's album, but getting 3 new songs with Lanegan and the Moore show on DVD after all these years is such an unexpected treat.  Love it.
1118026470|5.0|Reading this book up to around page 600 made me seriously question how anyone could give it less than 5 stars.  The amount of knowledge it gave me for a mere $25 is absolutely astounding.  I was eagerly waiting to finish it so I could come review it.<br /><br />Then I finished it, and I understood some of the criticisms.  It starts to feel like it's repeating itself after a while, and the product placement for Burp start to become a bit more annoying.<br /><br />Still, the rest of the book is chock full of great, detailed information.  If you're like me and had a basic understanding of how SQL injection worked, but wanted to get a deeper look, this book is perfect.  If you chopped off the last 200 pages you would have a book that was STILL worth well over $25.  It's hard for me to give it less than 5 stars when my major complaint is that it gives too much information.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're a beginner or intermediate to web application security and you're wondering whether you should buy this, just do it.  You won't be disappointed.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|i brag about this as though it were my brainchild.  just spellbinding.  alfie boe is mesmerizing as is norm lewis.
1439152799|3.0|I'm going to write my review in terms of dichotomies.<br /><br />Kate Morton definitely has writing in her bones.<br /><br />Why this is good: The prologue is an excerpt from The True History of the Mud Man (a story that one character in the book writes). What a way to suck the reader in! Throughout the story, her descriptions of things like the weather, the castle, the characters, are worded so perfectly.<br /><br />Why this is bad: Every character in the book is a writer. Well, not Percy. But every other main character is. Edie is (okay, technically she doesn't write, but she works in publishing and is obsessed with books), and her mother Meredith is. The other two Blythe sisters are. The Blythe father is. Writers tend to write about what they know, so it was smart for Morton to not venture into unknown territory. But seriously? Does she not have any other interests or hobbies that she has any knowledge of? I felt like I was in this word vortex, and reading and writing was about all that existed in any of these characters' lives.<br /><br />Morton chose an unusual setting for this novel.<br /><br />Why this is good: It takes a skilled writer to make the setting into a character in its own right, and Morton did this splendidly. Plus, who doesn't like reading a story that takes place in a castle?<br /><br />Why this is bad: The concept of living in a castle didn't quite seem fully fleshed out. I kept waiting for her to explain exactly how it came to be that three more or less ordinary women (high class, but don't appear to be royalty) just happened to wind up being born and raised in a castle. It's an unusual enough home that I think it demands some sort of history as to why the house was built and how it was passed down, but no explanation was ever given.<br /><br />Morton writes long books.<br /><br />Why this is good: Most books end around 350 pages. Morton's books are just getting good around that point, and as a reader I'm desperately longing for there to be agood chunk left to read, and it's so nice of Morton to accommodate me in that manner.<br /><br />Why this is bad: Morton's books don't really pick up until halfway through. I have to spend an awful lot of time slogging through only halfway interesting text before I get to the good stuff.<br /><br />Recommended overall? No. There was too much filler and not enough meat.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I cannot begin to explain how wonderful this book is. King is at his best in this book. His description of the 1950's transported me there and I wished I was living back then. Not only that, the love story was so touching and engrossing that I found myself wanting to hear more about Jake and Sadie than Oswald. I was hoping the ending would be different, but it was still a good ending. HIghly recommended!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Interesting story that had great parts, good parts and some very slow parts. He covers an interesting world with interesting stories - richly imagined environment.
B006ZS4G24|5.0|I bought this for my Grandchild and she loved it : Lego is always reliable and they have some bright new ideas for kits for kids these days.  I used to buy it almost forty years ago for my children and they played with it for hours.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The story of this CEO is interesting told honestly and with insight. A great read for anyone with an interest in history and how we got to where we are today!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am SO glad this program is available on the Kindle Fire. I just love it. O hope to watch the entire series.
B006LSZECO|3.0|There is no one to love in this story of flawed human beings. Solid story that is well written  but the story does not lift or illuminate the human condition in fact it couds all interactions until nothing is real except damage and its impact to people centered on the broken hub of relationships. This a very sad story.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|With a voice like this , Mayer is one of the best buys I made this year. I just love guys with falseto voicess and  he just do it for me.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|i dont like that you have to buy keys and then use so many of them to even move forward... and i love how you move from place to place but even with that there should be something that you can collect to get something like the eggs before.... right now my score is in the 8000000's (seriously) but im about to quit playing because i am board and i have beat everyone... WHATS NEXT??
B00942X8PY|5.0|If you are familiar with Flow Free, this is very similar.  It does add a few more elements and is fun to play.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|It's Like apples to apples but with really awesome and beautiful pictures. Really makes you be creative and helps you get to know your fellow-players better.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is an absolutely immersive and addictive game experience.  The graphics and sounds are truly top notch.  The goal is to absorb other objects smaller than yourself in order to become larger and larger.  The first few levels are simple enough, but it gets much more challenging as you play.  This game will keep you coming back for more. It does seem to consume a good bit of battery power on my Galaxy S3, but it is well worth playing!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|To take such a massive literary work and turn it into a series is amazing -to turn it into one of the best series ever is unbelievable.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Great movie. Good for whole family with plenty of references for anyone who played video games growing up. Well worth seeing
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The feature itself is great but when you  turn a 300 page book into a movie trilogy you have to add a lot of superfluous<br />special effects that do nothing but detract from the overall presentation. Now you have to buy 3 dvds and wait three years to get the whole story. It is still a wonderful movie but the &#34;greed&#34; thing is getting to be a bit much.
B00011KHTM|5.0|I bought this adapter to connect my additional screen to my MacBook (2008 model) and it works perfectly. Money well spent.

1608193381|5.0|I lot of what Ha-joon Chang writes in this book has been known for a long time. For instance that the the World Bank and the IMF are working hard to keep the poor countries poor.<br />He praises a German economist named Friedrich List and seems to believe that he is an unknown. Well more than 50 years ago we were told about him in the school I went to. And the text book and the teacher approved of List.
B005KXT58U|5.0|I've been a fan of Evanescence since I heard/saw their music video for \\"Bring Me to Life.\\"  I have most of their albums and really love their music.  Despite being out of the spotlight for 5 years (and I was chomping at the bit to hear new stuff), they've come back and they're incredible.  They've grown, changed, and the music composition is fantastic.  Amy Lee's voice is beautiful, strong, harsh and ethereal, and the instruments work so well together.  Very happy with my purchase!!!<br /><br />**My only complaint is about the Enhanced DVD.  While I love the behind the scenes stuff, I would have preferred a CD and DVD, because the disc will not play in all players (for instance, my husband's car CD player.  I think the combination of formats confuses some players.  I ended up purchasing the album from Amazon during their 10th Anniversary celebration stuff.  Now I can burn the music onto a CD that will play.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book proved to be the first of many Nicholas Sparks books that I will be reading. The romance and separate perspectives gave so many different angles that kept me wanting to continue putting the rest of the puzzle together. Loved it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I laughed and cried. Great book!!!!!! Would recommend to anyone. Third book in the series is the best because it has a good balance of exciting action and hot sex
1476734941|5.0|Read this book as soon as I got it!  Very interesting statistics and makes good sense!  I've started the diet and it happens to be quite liberating on the &#34;fast&#34; days - that is, not having to figure out all the meals throughout the day since you only eat one or two small ones.  I've found that I don't over-indulge the day after the &#34;fast&#34; days either.  Totally amazed and looking forward to seeing results in the next few weeks!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accu Weather is a great free weather app. I love the updated layout. It's. really easy to change between saved locations and to see both the weekly and hourly views.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Contrived and poorly written. If I didn't need to read this for my book club, I would have put it down and not finished it. Waste of time. So many good books to read....this is not one of them.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book was great! Everything about it was unique and like nothing I've ever read before. I love how its set in the future and how it shows our world \\"the rusty world\\" through their point of view.
B00164GDD2|5.0|Recently purchased this film classic after waiting for a boxset of both Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2 to show up on the release calendar for Sony to no avail. Plus seeing as a third part is in limbo, for good reason, and my 3 year old son loves the franchise (Raising him like an 80's kid), I got over waiting for boxset and grabbed this. We love it. Many of the effects look dated now due to today's obvious FX improvements and high definition's crystal clear picture, but the magic of the performances still shines through. No pop-culture enthusiast or movie lover should miss out on owning this as a part of their film collection. Who you gonna buy? Ghostbusters!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this app is mildly entertaining but becomes very repetitive very fast. I would be more entertained if I could do more than move my character and call others. that's all it really is
B007IXWKUK|5.0|2nd time through! Still as great as the first time! Can't wait to retread the third book again. Awesome read!
1577314808|5.0|I have been tormented and seeking for years in constant battle between my spirit and ego.  I was at war with myself.  I lay awake night after night with thoughts racing through my head that I could not stop.  It was torture even if the thoughts were good ones.  The thoughts were not worry or stressful, they were just unrelenting.  Sometimes they tried to play creative and even write books in my head.  I suffered depression, temper tantrums and pure misery from it.  Although I have read hundreds of books on psychology, spiritualism, seeking inner peace and such, this book finally succeeded.  It taught me how to quiet my racing thoughts after living with them, being victimized by them, for 60 years.  For that alone I give this book five stars.<br /><br />For years I have heard and said regarding finding inner peace that \\"It is simple but it is not easy\\".  I got the concepts, I knew the methods but I could not stop my racing thoughts.  Perhaps it just had to get simple enough for me to finally get it.  This book made it easy for me to do it.  It made the so called \\"not easy\\" very easy.  The step by step guide and repetion of the ideas in different ways worked for me.  The peacefullnes I have found is pricelesss.  I can go to bed at night or take a nap in the afternoon without my thoughts tormenting me.  I now have power over my thoughts and it just gets better and better as I practice it.<br /><br />It is not a deep complicated Spiritual book.  I have read plenty of those that I understood but could not practice.  This is the learning how to walk book before you can run with the wolves without being eaten alive.

B000GWE44U|5.0|Eyes Wide Shut & The Shining are two Kubrick films that brilliantly create visual allegories for what some called the New World Order (genesis w/ Freemasonry/Bavarian Illuminati -- Skull & Bones.  The film's depctions of the Overlook Hotel mystery visually conveys some of the theories out there.<br /><br />For those of you who are familiar with Jay Wiedner and his work (i.e. Stanley Kubrick, Overlook Hotel/\\"The Shining\\" (red,white & blue meme) & \\"Eyes Wide Shut \\"(allegory for the American/USSR Experiment & Green/Red coding memes)), here's a trip down the NWO Masonic Rabbit hole for you to enjoy: [...]See the film/documentary (http://www.amazon.com/Kubricks-Odyssey-Secrets-Hidden-Films/dp/B004PF0FJM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1365399491&sr=8-1&keywords=jay+weidner) if you haven't already.<br /><br />Also:<br />Room 237 Movie<br />[...]<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut -- Check Out Weidner's two films. Icke's stuff (Global Conspiracy Guide -- a bit of doublespeak/disinformation but mostly good stuff & the 5 hour Ring Of Power (\\"Empire of the City\\") are also worth reviewing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|We needed a 3-D version for our new TV.  We purchased a new 3-D TV and need to start buying movies for it.  This is just one of many that we plan on buying.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|The rediscovery of this beautiful music and poetry is an amazing story that borders on fairytale. Rodriquez is finally receiving the recognition he has long deserved--better late than never!
B004SIP7US|5.0|I chose this movie for a replacement.  I had one in the VHS version and it got damaged.  I needed to replace it for my collection...
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This is an OK movie.  I hear the whole book will end up as a trilogy.  As it stands the first installment is tedious and too long.
B003BLPTB0|1.0|Based on my previous experience with a pair of Classic clog that I bought in Canada 15 years ago and still are fine, I decided to order a new pair of Mens-Yukon-Sport-Espresso [[ASIN:B003BLPTB0 Crocs Men's Yukon Sport Clog]], now made in Mexico. I ordered my new pair to be delivered at an address in Florida and from there they were forwarded to me in Colombia. I was excited about my new Crocs which arrived a couple of weeks after I ordered them, because of all the steps I accepted to take in order to get another pair of great Crocs. When they finally arrived they looked superb. I put them on and went out for a walk. After 100 meters I felt as if something had stuck to the bottom of my Crocs BUT, to my surprise, when I looked closely, the two pieces of sole, that are now glued to the bottom of the Crocs, came completely unstuck in one of the Crocs and in the other one the stitches of the leather-like top had become undone for a couple of centimetres. It is not worth sending them back because the international journey back will cost a fortune. I decided to mend them here at home but the sense of frustration with what used to be a great product has become a decision to never buy a pair of Crocs again . What happened with your quality control? Have yo become too international, too diverse and too big to care about quality over quantity? The Mens-Yukon-Sport-Espresso that I bought look great but in terms of quality they are just a piece of useless rubbish.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|This movie is well crafted and contains some wit and touching moments.  But I downgrade it because it purveys the bogus idea that romance is the central meaning in life and that we should all be dancing and romancing until we have one foot in the grave.  The author of this story can't be very old or surely they would know that at a certain point you are glad to get past all that and find there are other important things in life on which to turn your attention.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Multiple difficulty levels, easy to use. I like the different &quot;accomplishments&quot; - gives you something to work towards. Works really well with touchscreen.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|If you like detail and looking for solutions to tough problems while maintaining a human face to it all, you will like this story.  The author did a great job of keeping the technical simple and understandable. A great and entertaining read.
1616550414|5.0|A favorite of the birthday girl & all her friends!  Made me a hero.  Much better price than Newbury Comics.
B005DZMNHA|5.0|I love Chris Rea music and this disc contains wonderful songs. I would recommend it for others to listen.  Great artist!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Liked the original and was not disappointed with this remake.<br />Action and good story.  They did a great job... kept me entertained thru the whole movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great addictive game for myself and my fiddler son.  We have competitions to see who can get most coins and points.  Great graphics and always changing scenes and characters!  This game challenges uoj just enough that you cannot stop!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It sometimes doesn't download but its not a knock off. Every month is a new theme.  Plus new characters every month for the theme.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|I love Mel Gibson in this 4 movie series.  There is action, suspense, drama, and comedy rapped up in one.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The plot is steady and engaging, the visuals must be seen to be believed. The movie has inspired me to read the book.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I jumped at the opportunity to pick up the Kindle version for free last week.  I had been wanting to read it for months but it had not yet made it to the top of the \\"wish list\\".<br />Read this book, it will make so much sense in just a few chapters.  It answers the question \\"I'm so busy all day, but what have I gotten done?\\" and \\"What can be done about it?\\"<br />Get it, read it, reflect on it, then do it!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book should be a part of all education degree programs and should be read by everyone in a leadership position.  Sometimes the author repeats points that have already been made, but that is a small price to pay for the insights gained by reading this book.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It kept shutting down on me so I downloaded a different app and get up to the minute weather reports with no interuptions.
0446554995|5.0|My first book by these authors came from a GoodWill Store and have been fascinated with their books ever since. I can't wait for the next one to come out. The way they end their books with special agent pendergast, keeps you wanting more.
B005HS00NW|5.0|It is a 2 disc collection and I am so glad I got it.  There is not one song on it that I dislike.  Happy with my selection!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good read.  Can't wait to read the second book....maybe the third.  Good writer in that she wraps you in the story.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have been using Facebook for years and thanks to it I have been able to find people I have not spoken to or seen in over 15 years.  Thank you!
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|The LOTR DVDs will always remain in my collection.  Good films because they mostly kept the books' original content intact.  But the Hobbit films will never be added to my collection.  I watched this on demand and could not finish the first hour.  I kept yelling at it.<br /><br />Jackson et al have taken a story that tells useful lessons about not being able to deny one's part in the world and turned it into complete crap.  The film strays so far from the book that I feel very sorry for young ones that see this movie and never read the real thing.<br /><br />The liberties taken with this movie, only in the first hour, had me howling.  Two of the most appalling:<br /><br />Our party of dwarves come across an old derelict house.  Gandalf says that a farmer and his wife used to live here.  Read--Jackson killed off Tom Bombadill and Goldberry!  Why?  What's the point?<br /><br />Gandalf finds and gives Bilbo the dagger, Sting, which Bilbo tries to reject.  In the book, Bilbo finds Sting on his own and claims it with confidence.<br /><br />I'm not sure WTF Jackson et al were going for in this misadventure, but I see no reason at all to see the upcoming films or even finish this first one.  I give Jackson a stiff middle finger for messing up an iconic piece of literature.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome! I did not want to put it down once I started reading. I can't wait to read the other books!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the book but wondered why it would take 3 movies.  Very well done.  A lot went on in the book and I'm glad they didn't leave out small things to make the mover smaller and hard to follow.  Well done.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|worked perfectly!<br />charged both my Kindle Fire and Kindle FIre HD easily with no issues.<br />perfect length as well so either Kindle can be used while charging!
1400069807|5.0|Much of the press on this book has focused on the way giant food companies have leveraged salt, sugar, and fat to create something like addiction in common grocery store products, contributing to the rise of obesity, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease in America. If you've kept up on research in this field, you won't be amazed by this aspect of the book. If you haven't, this book will give you a very good overview.<br /><br />However, the focus here is not primarily on the health issues. It's on the history of marketing, the economic aspects of the processed food industry, and what Big Food did on the way from corn flakes to Limited Edition S'mores Toaster Strudel.<br /><br />This is one of those books that makes you see the world differently after you read it.<br /><br />Every trip to the grocery store, every restaurant meal, and -- for me, since I work in marketing -- every line I write for processed food companies now reminds me of the marketing and production strategies outlined in the book.<br /><br />And yet Moss has some compassion for the companies he's chronicling. He points out that the representatives of the companies he meets don't usually eat and drink their own products, but he also points out that the demands made on those companies by Wall Street, by lobbyists, and by consumers themselves leave the companies feeling that they have no choice. The way that food is now made, shipped, and sold makes it impossible for Big Food to back down from the current practice of making foods almost entirely of fat, salt, and sugar. If they cut down on one, they have to increase the others in order to produce things that will work in the current food production system.<br /><br />The book is well researched, well written, and honest. It's the story of how we -- consumers, farmers, food manufacturers, government departments, commodities lobbyists, and all -- got into our current situation. It doesn't offer much hope of getting out without severe economic and/or health consequences.h consequences.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Really keeps you guessing.  Wonder why he never gave her the picture in the end?  Have to go get the next book!
B0094K20FK|5.0|This has been my favorite Star Trek movie, and one of my favorite films period, since it came out back in the 80s.  I really enjoyed how it looks and sounds on my Kindle Fire and on my TV fed via HDMI from the Kindle.  Great movie.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|If this movie was a school course, and I was tested after watching it (instead of listening to a lecturer), I'd probably flunk. I never liked history in school, but I can usually wade through and often enjoy an interestng historical drama on screen. PBS is my favorite station. I like Ken Burns. I did not like this movie.<br /><br />I didn't fall asleep, it's just that my eyes kept wandering away from the screen. Room after smoke-filled room full of men talking, talking, endlessly talking just could not hold my attention. I don't know what I was expecting, maybe a few dramatic speeches, a couple of war scenes, a love story? Definitely not this. It may be a fabulous, award worthy film, but I could'nt watch it to the end.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Much has been written about the torture scenes - if they really happened, if we should rely on torture as a reliable way to extract information and ultimately if we, as a freedom loving democracy, should even use torture. Every moviegoer can answer those questions in there own way. The movie certainly doesn't gloss over the torture scenes or make light of it.<br /><br />Beyond that the movie is riveting. The first 90 minutes concerns itself with the tedious but vital intelligence gathering in the 9 1/2 years leading up to locating OBL. The female CIA agent played by Jessica Chastain (The Help) works tirelessly on this. She becomes convinced that a minor player in Al Qaeda, a courier, is the way forward. She and a small group of covert agents tediously and painstakingly focus on the courier. When the courier's travels finally lead them to a reclusive walled in residence she reports this up the chain of command. Because she can not offer absolute certainity that OBL is the mysterious resident the bureaucrats and politicians above her pay grade become choked with caution. Days and weeks go by as the proper course of action is finalized. The last 45 minutes are intense as the Navy Seals make their move. This is where the movie shines.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I downloaded this game, and I'm glad I did it has lots of games to choose from, trust me you will never get bored. Keep up the good work.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|not that fun. kind of boring and there is not much to do. I bought it out of curiosity and it is not worth it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing because it is not like any other game so everyone should play it this is a good game
0345803493|5.0|It is a great book and a great trilogy. I loved it. It is an interesting story and extremely addictive.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is not a 5 rating only because of the numerous, and I mean numerous errors, hundreds.  Yes they can be distracting and more frustratingly, so easy to proofread and fix? (I'd give 4.5 stars if I could)<br /><br />I am not a scientist in the related fields introduced in this story.  You'd think a story that mostly involves one man would become excruciatingly dull.  I found the story line, how he survives and all the science that explains how he survives fascinating, if not simply what makes the story.  Saying he grew plants, then he made water out of air then he....obviously would not suffice.  Its about how he did it all.  Perhaps as other reviewers pointed out, all the science is not officially complete, however I found it complete enough, if not more so, and I am a person who may like scientific things more than the average person.  I studied and loved science in school but have not made it my career, so there's a relative reference for you.<br /><br />The author makes it seem like he has personally been to mars and experienced these things himself.  What a load of research he must have done.  Bravo.  And if not, believable enough, because I'll never go to Mars, so Bravo anyway and thank you for introducing me to ideas and a world I now have a better understanding and appreciation for.
B008Q1T1IW|5.0|I loved the movie and I though the songs were great so i bought the soundtrack. Totally worth it !
B003G4W49C|5.0|To add to all the other reviews this was one I looked forward to at all times to pick up and read when I had any spare moment. I reserve 5's for the most creative and this was one, smart and read in an adult tone, even though it featured children, and unlike some readers reviews, I believe, highly believable.  Perhaps you have had to be an unusual and intelligent child yourself to understand.
B0098460O4|5.0|What a beautiful cd! I love it.  I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of it.  It is very moving.
B00BF123WG|2.0|The movie shows no substance on how anyone is detained, intel used is fuzzy and not clear- it's more about a young woman's struggle getting respect in the CIA- OBL was just a convenient way to highlight her struggle- Boring at best.
B000V86OKG|5.0|It is a pretty epic season.  I thought it was going the sexual direction of most shows with everybody having sex with each other but it did not turn out that way in the end
B0058VW36U|1.0|It did not work for me. I Don't even know how to get my money  back ... thieves,., It did not work for me.
0756697875|5.0|My only complaint is that they are really made for kids and not collectors. I'd gladly by a &#34;source&#34; book for each of the major licensed products ( Star Wars, DC Super Heroes, Marvel Superheoes, The Lord Of The Rings/The Hobbit and though I don't collect it - Ninjago ) with annual updates for each, even if they were only softcover. A more thourough &#34;checklist&#34; style page or Lego link would have made this a 5.5 stars.
0345803485|4.0|Since my spare time is limited, I haven't read the whole book, but what I have read is interesting and is able to keep my mind on the book.
B00511ONPG|5.0|If you are serious about going on social media, this is the book to start. It gave us a clear path on how to create a real social media department and it does a good job on helping you defining the soul of the department. Very easy to read, I really enjoyed every second I spent reading it.
B000000OSE|4.0|Guns N' Roses released their second full length record/records in 1991. While I love GNR' for what they are, I'm one of the few fans who feel these two albums would have been better as just one really good collection.<br /><br />Being released four years after their smash debut \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" GNR' decided to make a little sound detour for this mammoth collection of songs. Gone are all the real in your face hard rock songs, and in their place are several bloated ballads, along with over-the-top rockers as well. I'm not bashing the entirety of the albums; I actually like them both, but man, some of these songs are wild. Songs that are my favorites are \\"Dead Horse,\\" \\"Live and Let Die,\\" \\"Bad Obsession\\" and \\"Garden of Eden.\\"<br /><br />These are easily needed in any rock fans collection. Just know that this doesn't remind you all that much of \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\"
B002BGA7WM|3.0|I own all their main albums (except Hoodoo), and this is probably my least favorite. There are a few good songs, and it's really not a bad album, but it's not as good (for me) as their next three (Origin of Symmetry, Absolution and Black Holes and Revelations).
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I guess after waiting so long for \\"Chinese Democracy,\\" Geffen grew tired and decided to finally release a GNR' greatest hits album. While I'll not complain my favorite songs are missing from this list, this album is far from complete.<br /><br />In 1987, when GNR' released their landmark album \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" and it subsequently became one of the largest selling records of the decade, many people believed this band would rule the rock n' roll world for years to come. After much infighting and bickering, and the release of a couple more albums, GNR' eventually disolved very acrimoniously. While these guys are still well respected in the hard rock community, it's a shame to think what they could have been if they would have been in it to win it.<br /><br />This album is good for what it is, a greatest hits offering. It doesn't contain everything you's ever want from GNR', but it's a nice place to start for the new and inexperienced fan. I would suggest starting with \\"Appetite\\" and working your way forward, but if this is all you need more power to you then.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books. They are fun to read and kept me hooked until the end. I finished them in less than two weeks, that should tell you how good they are :)
B000000OQF|5.0|Releasing their debut album in 1987, GNR' were a kick in the a$$ to the hard rock LA scene of the day. While most bands of the day were more interested in how they looked in spandex and make-up, GNR' just flat-out kicked some major a$$ with this album.<br /><br />Drawing on sounds similar to Aerosmith, GNR' succeeded in incorporating the LA sound into that mix and coming up with an out-of-this-world hard rock sound. I'm sure many people would disagree with me, but no way do I ever think of Guns as a \\"hair band.\\" They may have borrowed some from the scene, but they easily offered more substance than fluff. I'm sure by now just about everyone on the planet has heard at least one song from these guys, and most of their best are on \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\" Songs like \\"Welcome To The Jungle,\\" \\"Sweet Child of Mine,\\" and \\"Paradise City\\" are all well-known, but some of the rest are the best the album has to offer. My favorites are \\"Out Ta Get Me,\\" \\"Night Train,\\" and \\"Rocket Queen,\\" but everything on here is top-notch stuff.<br /><br />If by chance, you do not already own this record, you better buy this pretty quick. Turn this sucker up as loud as you can and remember what the glory days of rock n' roll sounded like young people!
B00947N6UG|3.0|The movie is excellent, and I didn't want to bring down the ratings, but I think its important to people to know that the \\"digital copy\\" is a nightmare.  I am somewhat technical, but now i have to create an account at Paramount... oh wait, now I have to install Silver light, oh wait, now I have to download the digital copy... which dumps itself in some obscure spot on my hard drive.  Wait... now what.  They're 4 cab files, encrypted.  So now what.  I want this on my kids kindle.. or atleast my ipad.  Oh no, not that easy.  Itunes will not recognize it.  Then I notice that I could have downloaded it as a digital copy instead of the ultraviolet copy.  Oh ok, so try download it there, assuming in apple format.  Oh wait, won't let me download said its already been redeemed.  Are you KIDDING ME.<br /><br />Hoops to jump through, way to go.  Big thumbs down.  Maybe once you learn how to do it, its not as convoluted, but if you're new to this, and don't want to jump through hoops, skip the digital copy.
B000000OSG|4.0|Guns N' Roses released their second full length record/records \\"Use Your Illusion 1 & 2,\\" in 1991.

B0055QYKQO|5.0|This is the third Gigabyte motherboard I've purchased and I'm more than pleased with the product. I will look to Gigabyte when I build my next computer as well. Customer service is exceptional as well.
B00C1BTWV4|1.0|I was not able to view this movie on my kindle fire. I have purchased other movies with no problem. I purchased this one twice, thinking the first time was my fault since I loaded and watched Harry Potter with no problem, but the second purchase was the same. It would not play! So I wasted $6 on one movie that my son was never able to watch.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Great movie. Even my husband and i loved it. A movie to watch over and over and we did! Highly recommended.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I have read many books about North Korea trying to understand a country we know little about. This is one of the best ones. Your heart breaks for Shin while he frustrates you at the same time. His story is one that everyone should read. Especially now.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. We loved it when we saw it on TV and i knew i had to purchase it.
0062082353|5.0|If you like to read about combat and get first hand accounts of what some of our Servicemen witness and go through, this is an excellent book.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|It makes sense at the end, everything, and I never suspected, which is the way I like things.  Loved the characters, the sense of a past impinging on a present, of unfinished business.  Read it after the 'Lewis Man' and it made no difference - added to the depth of the experience.<br /><br />Peter May is a revelation.
B008GM1G70|5.0|I must purchase this to have in my collection.  It was mindblowing. Wonderful. Words are not enough for me to express how I feel.
0307477479|5.0|Seriously, just go read it.<br /><br />Need me to convince you? OK. My best friend convinced me with the words \\"Here, read this. You'll hate it, but in a good way.\\" I knew exactly what she meant, but I love books that can be described that way. If you don't, it might not be your cup of tea. I should add that it made me cry repeatedly, but in a good way. The overarching tone is one of hope in the face of the \\"goon squad\\". (Don't skip anything or you won't understand!)<br /><br />But anyway... This is a book that explores how people work, how life works, how society works; where it's recently been, where it's headed.<br /><br />There's a bit of every era of life portrayed here. You see people at their beginnings, their greatest moments, their declines. This book covers the human condition from coming of age to death. Most of all, you see people at their worst moments, but those turn out to be defining moments, that lead to lovely things. Alas, I can't discuss the themes in any greater detail without spoiling the effect for future readers.<br /><br />If you like short stories, if you value authors who can stage a scene or define an emotional state with about four words, if you love people and can forgive imperfection, read this book. If you're not sure how your life got to be the way it is, read this book. If you have a nostalgic streak and are over thirty read this book. If you love music (especially if you know entirely too much about punk), read this book. If you want to be kept thinking for weeks read this book. If none of this appeals to you, then don't.<br /><br />But you'll be missing out.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The second time through was even better than the first.  Truly brilliant.  If only the films could do it justice.....
B0096I9UTE|4.0|I like it, the package is really nice, It would be better if it has a DVD with the whole sessions.
B005LAIHCM|2.0|This is a bad movie. There is no \\"horror\\" in this horror film. It's predictable as all get out and is very safe and PG-13. This movie is what is wrong with Hollywood. They think the audience is dumber than dogs***.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|Is good music, but I like it more the previos cd and also the first one, this has good music but not the best.

B009S6ZKSO|5.0|This CD / DVD edition is the best, the videos are really good, and her voice is great and also in the videos you can se how beautiful she is.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This is one of those movies that you know how it ends because it is a part of history. But the action is good, it keeps moving and it is tense all the way to the end. My complaint is not of the story or the movie itself, but I purchased it at 480p (SD). Big mistake as it was grainy and not very clear.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Amazing, simply amazing having all this songs and music in 2 cds is really really good, I enjoy it a lot.
0547884591|4.0|This was an entertaining read.  Not just a cook book but lots of other quirky things.  Have tried quite a few of the recipes and we are enjoying them.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|For sure is one of the best songs in the oscar 2013, great voice, and also great movie, an oscar winner for sure.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|This is my favorite TV sitcom. Having seasons 1-5 on DVD means I can watch any episode any time I want to. The Blu-Ray Disc is very clear and their are additional clips(outakes) one cannot see on other discs. I can recommend this set highly.

B003VPOXAE|1.0|I bought this for a young man to read as he reminds me of Jem, the young boy in the story. This particular book wouldn't be sold for a dime at a yard sale. Marked, underlined on EVERY page and completely unreadable. Shame on the bookseller!

The book would be useful for someone who had not yet unwrapped their Pi and had no idea how to set it up, but beyond that point very little of the material is Pi-specific. I was particularly disappointed to find only two VERY basic hardware projects described: flashing an LED and reading a pushbutton. The writing style, to the authors' credit, was clear, with little of the forced humor that often appears when techies are writing for what they perceive to be a non-technical audience. But in places it was clear that the Pi is so new that they had little to write about. For example on page 210: &#34;It would be impossible to create an exhaustive list of all the add-on boards available or planned for release in the near future...&#34; It may be just as useful to depend on web-based sources to get up to speed on the Pi and save the cost of the book.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Interesting sounds and techniques used. All round good listening. If you are a fan you will definelty enjoy this new masterpiece from the incredible David Bowie
B004XNGKBS|1.0|Tried to use the app, but just gave up. For example, why is the app trying to give me a different tutorial every time I try to create a new note?
B004GTKP3S|5.0|it was interesting to read all discussions... pros and cons... that the railroad brought.  Just like today, people do not always go along with changes in their own communities.
0061537969|5.0|The book was a wonderful story<br />The condition of the book was excellent even better than described..<br />I am totally pleased with it.
0670647500|5.0|What a wonderfully written biography. Carter's exceptional natural writing talent shines through as he gives you honest insight into his tumultuous life. His language is moving and also amazing to know he was self educated while incarcerated. I gave this book to my father and he enjoyed hearing the language of his childhood and remembered when Carter was in his prime. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys biographies and reading a good personal story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game alot i play it everyday but i seem to always run out of money and can never buy what i need. I recommend that in the next patch u add a way to sell some of the items you have and make mystery box prizes easier to get.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The book was amazingly awesome. It had action and adventure. The book had parts that you wouldn't expect. I give it 5 stars.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is easy to play and does a good job of passing time.  It is very similar to other games of it's type so it doesn't take much getting used to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is truly awesome!!! I love the graphics and lay out!!! I really recommend this game for all ages!! The kids I baby sit LOVE this game!!! Thank you so much!!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I cant believe how many people complain about having to buy an app. The same people who whine about spending. $2.99 for a game that may bring hours of enjoyment, think nothing about spending 4$ on a cup of overrated coffee every morning. And in regards to the people who b#@%* and moan about in app purchases, it says clearly in the description that there are in app purchases if you choose to buy them, so if you are feeling &quot;ripped off &quot; you have only yourself to blame for not reading the description.  As for the game itself, I like the STAR WARS theme and the different attributes given each bird, based on powers the star war movie characters had. I just wished it had more land based boards and less outerspace type of locales, but still a solid 4 stars.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|The story i good and romantic.<br />The actors are performing excellent, and the play has many conversations, and is happening in a wonderfull landscape of<br />Southern Britain.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is a fabulous movie, one of the best in 2012.  It's a movie not to be missed.  Quite funny and very touching.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|It's quick and to the point but also very entertaining. If you like Hornby's voice and style, this will not disappoint.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is like few I've read - the kind where you can't help but see the world differently when you've finished, you keep the characters with you as you move about your day...hearing their witicisms as you experience life through a lens altered by them.<br /><br /> I've not read a book that reduced me to a tear soaked mess and made me smile alternately on each page. From the start, I could not put this book down. I read it in bed, in restaurants, and finally cried myself silly on an airplane(the person next to me surely believes I'm emotionally disturbed). Yet it was so gripping, so observant, so truthful and yet impossibly funny that I'm hoping it's not morbid of me to name my first child Gus, and then I immediately imagine the quip he'd respond to that with.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A touching, quirky, and surprisingly very real story of love, loss, awakening, and acceptance. The complexities of the human mind pulled me into this story & kept me reading. The characters are well constructed & u can see their lives unfolding.<br /><br />Drcdelange<br /><br />On
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book continues the great story from the previous book and develops the supernatural story line of those beyond the wall.
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading the WoT series for the past 17 years, and am very happy with how the series ends.  Brandon is very good at keeping the feel of the WoT series, while also keeping things very fast paced and engaging.<br /><br />To prepare for this book I re-read the entire series over the past year, if you have the time I highly recommend this course, as it kept the entire story fresh in my head, and actually gave me a new perspective on a few of the books in the middle of the series that I wasn't a huge fan of the first time I read them.<br /><br />I'd love to talk about the points of this book that I loved, but I'd rather not ruin anything for others.  So, just go read it for yourself you won't regret it.
B005DN7W4G|5.0|i love this movie along with Armageddon and 2012 they are my favorites.  They have a great story line and regardless of the year it was made, it has pretty good special effects.  It gets me all teared up at the end every time.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|If you are looking for an update on the film noire - a caper that speaks to contemporary issues and conditions of life - you cannot do better than this film.  Though I will talk of details in the film, I will avoid spoilers.<br /><br />The film starts off with the image of violence in a home, then cuts to a drama of depression.  A beautiful young woman appears to be fighting for her life, her eyes, her every motion afflicted with existential pain.  Her husband, a crooked financier, is about to leave prison.  She has been waiting for him for 4 years, in a job with supportive boss who understands depression from personal experience.  After an attempt to hurt herself, she goes to see an ambitious young psychiatrist, who seems genuinely concerned and goes the prescription route, which is so commonplace today.  As they run through traditional medications, the psychiatrist finally hits on an experimental one that he happens to be testing as a \\"consultant for pay\\" to a big pharma company.  For a time it appears to work, then the woman suddenly becomes murderously violent, but perhaps only for a single instance.<br /><br />As the case reaches the media, the doctor's life falls apart.  Did he make mistakes?  Was he ethically compromised?  Did he have ulterior motives?  Is he going crazy?  Or was he somehow set up?  The process becomes one of investigative backtracking, which in his desperation only the doctor believes may help.  It is a story of an intricate and completely believable journey that in the end reveals that no one involved is who they appeared to be.  In the delightful psychological twists, as only a great thriller can do, the viewer's perceptions of the characters is challenged again and again, with mounting fear and horror.<br /><br />This is an absolute delight for connoisseurs of the noire genre, a deliciously wicked puzzle of moral ambiguity and revealed evil.  Recommended with enthusiasm.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|This album is definitely growing on me, something Sounds of the Universe never did, I am actually liking the 4 deluxe edition songs very much, a couple of songs on the regular album are pretty weak, anyway, nice album overall. It baffles me though to see \\"old school\\" fans of DM who don't even rank the first 5 albums in their 5 favorites. Just like the Cure for me, the first albums are so special, I don't know how you can rank Music for the masses above Black Celebration or Some Great Reward. Anyway, such a great carreer, too bad they had to do Exciter and Sounds of the Universe!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Award winning movies usually turn out to be a ton of hype and little else.<br />I was sure that would be the case here.<br />I was wrong.<br />A brilliant and gripping look at the Iran hostage situation.<br />Incredible acting, brilliant direction, everything was perfect.<br />Definitely worth checking out.<br />Recommended.
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|Not sure why so many don't like this album, I suppose because it isn't 2001 anymore and your skinny jeans are too tight to put on. Bands move on, if you want the old Strokes go listen to the first two albums. I think this album is better than Angles, and I liked Angles quite a bit.  There is more catchy hooks on this album, like cross between the Cars and A-ha only with the Strokes sound. It's an enjoyable listen and should be viewed as a work on its own, not the band's past. I love the last song Call it Fate, Call it Karma which has a gypsy lounge vibe going on. One Way trigger is great as well, in fact this whole album is greatness. Maybe next time the band will return to their garage rock cool or whatever hipsters crave in NYC, but if not keep an open mind, this is good music.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|please update because it crashes whenever I try to open it so please please please please update it!!!!!! !!!!! !!!!!
B001TH16DI|5.0|My wife got this for me as a b-day gift.  I still couldn't be happier.  Excellent blu-rays WOK is still 2nd to none.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Loved how Daniel Craig portrayed James. His Characterization of a washed up agent made it more of a real Character to me... Just wish they hadn't killed off Judy's character of M.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|A worthy movie and a great treatment of the search for other life.  I hope if we fine an alien race they are this benign.
B008OTTSX4|4.0|Excellent tribute. The original album should be in a collection of Man's greatest achievements, but this tribute is stunning. Didn't care for the 'Lips version of Smoke.
B00A2GQT5C|5.0|whitney has the greatest voice I have ever heard singing no one could hit the notes like her she was the world best diva and well missed
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|Another great movie in the series to add to your collection.  Can't wait to see what's next.  Held your attention throughout.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I ordered this after reading the reviews on the appstore and at first all seemed well. I have a Polariod e-reader and for some reason the writing and tabs were so small I couldn't read them or even press them to continue playing the game. I had to remove it.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|This is an excellent CD with an interesting sound. If you like NIN, you will most likely love How to Destroy Angels too. While the sound isn't exactly the same, it's very close.
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|I have never seen any of the Vegas shows so this was all new to me... I really want to go to Vegas now!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Nice Graphics but I've played more fun responce games. There is not enough here to keep it on my phone to play.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Everything from start to finish......5 STARS!!<br />My Nana Babies LOVE this movie and anything else Tinker Bell.<br />Thank you very Much!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I've installed a few unstable apps before trying this one. I reccommend this one and Dailybible by Joansoft.<br /><br />Both are similar however this one is a bit better for self meditations (it has a fairly indept study plan, can read to you if you want to close your eyes and meditate or while cooking etc.) while the one from Joansoft is better for Social Meditations (easy link to share verses with your twitter/Facebook etc. and see comments and stories of blessings from others).<br /><br />Either is good...and kudos for installing your bible on the go
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This movie is just too darn cute!!<br />Anyone and everyone should see this movie!<br />From my 2 year old Nana Baby to 47 year old me, this movie was....FANTASTIC!!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|The level of dissapointment of  this space guzzling app really does not deserve my effort to review.<br /><br />I expected a fun app with many fun options of game play and got this 101 failures in 1 app
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another book by Kate Morton that keeps you wanting to read more.  I have enjoyed reading all of her novels.
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|Chuck captivated me since the first episode I saw. He is a cute, smart and amazing guy. Also, all the cast is excellent. I recommend it a lot, it's a funny tv show. And I still waiting for the movie.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|this is one of my granddaughters favorite movies. Glad we bought the combo pack, so she can watch it anywhere.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love it! The cast is wonderful! I couldn't wait to get it. Now I am up half the night watching &#34;One more hour&#34;. I feel like the whole cast are my friends.(I have no life,right?)
0810995212|5.0|This volume brings together many of J.C. Leyendecker's most sumptuous illustrative works.  For fans of his distinctive style and his fine aesthetic, this collection will surely please.  The biographical aspects of the text are not exhaustive, but as a visual reference source, this book is worth the price.
B001NKI60W|4.0|Frankly, I was never a great fan of the music of ABBA in their heyday. However, when I was dragged to the theater to see the stage version of their songs, I was impressed. The story line and songs matched perfectly, the energy of the production was uplifting and the overall effect was joyous. And then came the movie; Meryl Streep singing? Amanda Seyfried who? The movie, though, is quite up to its Broadway beginnings, even with all the Hollywood hoopla, stunning sets and expanded scenery. The women characters are great; Meryl is better than expected and absolutely absorbed in her role, Amanda has an excellent voice and Christine Baranski and Julie Walters ham it up wonderfully. The men however, don't fare as well. Pierce Brosnan can hold a note but sounds like he tearing his throat out. Luckily, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth don't have much to do. Still, it's all wonderful fun and worth watching or owning if you are a fan of musicals, Broadway or Hollywood, as I am.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Easy and quick read. This is not a book for everyone. There is a love story, but it's secondary, not really a romance book. If you're looking for magic and fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter or the Discovery of Wiches, this is not the book for you either. The magic is there, but it's a different kind of magic. The book also requires some suspension of disbelief. If you can't do that, you won't be able to fully enjoy the story.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|This film is a movie milestone-a film everyone has seen or at least knows about.  It is the role that Audrey Hepburn, one of the most loved actress of all time, will be most remembered for.  It is the movie that George Peppard will be remembered for-if he is remembered at all.  The song \\"Moon River\\" will always be in America's heart and soul.  This is an excellant DVD set of this movie, one that cannot be beat.
B00A757EFW|5.0|for us that remember pac-man in the arcade it is challanging without the physical joystick. kids have no trouble with the touch.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This film is the story of the murder of Mozart by the inferior composer Salieri.  Superfically, that is.  The film is really about the gifts God gives to certain people and how others not favored with these gifts react to this.  Salieri is not the only murderer of Mozart, The entire inferior group of musicians in the court of Vienna's king unite to make Mozart's life impossible.  This is one of the few modern classic films.  The music is the greatest of any film I can remember, the plot, costumes, and photography are superb.  One of the most enjoyable and engrossing movies every made.  This DVD set belongs in everyone's collection.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|It has all of the Atari games listed but you must pay $.99 for each one. Unfortunately it is advertised as free.
1400069807|5.0|Want to avoid heart attacks, high blood pressure and lose weight? READ IT!!!  You will learn just how much engineering goes into processed foods.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book certainly deserves a five star rating. Typically I am not quite as enthusiastic when I read a book after having seen the movie. This book is so well written I was unable to put it down. I Would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys an action-filled adventure that will have your heart racing.<br /><br />Kim
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|There isn't much to say, it's the Amazon Market with a TabletUI and it's mostly well done. There are a few things I would tweak hear and there to give you easier access to different sections of the website but overall it is well done.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Phenomenal it was like reading the first book except it's a t camp Jupiter and not camp half blood in all the book was great.
B008TT7CXW|4.0|It may be the size of a credit card but it is 5 to 6 times the thickness. That doesn't bother me at all because it does exactly what it is supposed to and has been super helpful for me. I develop custom re-packed stock ROM's for foreign tablets like those made by the Chinese company Ainol, so I have a lot of microSD cards around. This not only helped me organize and label them but also gave me an easy way to transport them with me when I'm not working on my little hobby from home.<br /><br />The actual case is durable plastic and protects the microSD cards very well. You do need longer fingernails to remove the cards from their slots and I do not have long enough fingernails (I bite them), so I keep a guitar pick around to pop them out when I need them. Overall though it was a good buy and I'm glad I randomly stumbled across this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Well written, suspenseful and funny. Also very addicting. Easily downloaded from Amazon.  I had watched season three and was happy to watch the other two to fill in the blanks.  Great fun.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|I know that many people will find it a bit odd to use the 3570 for the heart of the HTPC I built, but it works. The processor is powerful enough to handle anything thrown at it without an overclock, and the Intel HD 2500 integrated graphics can handle a blu-ray playback without a discrete GPU. No lag, no fuss, no problems. The low profile CPU cooler works, and unlike the horrid AMD coolers, it's nearly silent most of the time.<br /><br />One thing many people skimp on with an HTPC is the processor. But I'd rather have something that will have the power needed to last 4-5 years compared to some crappy dual core that saved them $70 now, but cost them an entirely new build in 2 years.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I just wish we don't have to pay for it. but other than that its awesome. love the background. thank you.
0446554995|5.0|I am an avid fan of the books written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Childs individually and together.  I have been following the books regarding Special Agent Pendergast and always look forward to the next chapter in his life.  The book started out with a shocker and I wasn't sure where they were going to go from there, but as always, these authors did not disappoint.  It was a page turner.
B001668J8M|5.0|good movie and love the steelcase :) this was really great buy!! worth the price two, just have to look for a nice price for it.
B004XZR63M|3.0|I bought this book to read about one person's regarding what the difference is between those who are successful and those who are not successful.  I did not find it as informative as I had hoped
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|an incredible movie from incredible people, i am a huge fan of cirque du soleil and have seen a 8 of the shows including 3 on vegas, highly recommended
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a great book which explains the problems that individuals can have with gluten even if they do not have celiac's disease or a gluten sensitivity.  It is well written and takes you through the science and chemistry of the reaction that occur.  It is a book that will make you rethink whether or not you want to keep gluten in your diet, decrease the amount of gluten in your diet or cut it out all together.
B002XZNHG4|3.0|It was an ok movie. I did not see it when it came out back in the 70's (??) so I now gave it a try. Woodie Allen's style is strange, but It was ok.
0698115635|1.0|I'm really surprised by all the positive reviews. I'm a kindergarten teacher and was excited to read a new Eric Carle book to my class, but this one just does not make any sense so I probably won't be using it. It has no plot, no point, and nothing exciting about it. I kept waiting for some great ending but it was disappointing. Also, it lists the days of the week backwards so it doesn't help much with learning the days of the week. And what in the world is ZOOP? I think my kindergarteners could have written a better book!
1878424114|5.0|We think this was a good book and when we finish reading it, we will pass along for someone else to read.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|As soon as I started playing the game it started making the creepiest noises I've ever heard in my entire life... I'm honestly freaked out.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I had never seen Les Miserables before, so I wasn't sure I would like it. I heard rave reviews from friends who had gone to see it in the theater, but also read some negative reviews on here...I went ahead and bought it anyway, and could not be happier with my purchase! This will be a movie I watch and re-watch for years to come. I LOVED the fact that almost the entire film was SUNG! I was pleasantly surprised with Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe's voices! Anne Hathaway's &#34;I dreamed a dream&#34; blew me away! So much emotion! I thought her rendition was perfect for the sentiment of the lyrics(I saw that others thought she over did it, but I disagree). I was not a fan of Amanda Seyfried's singing voice, but I cannot deny she can sing...I just prefer women who sing in a lower register. I have listened to other soundtracks of Les Miserables on Pandora and I enjoy this one the most. Of course everyone is different and has different tastes in music and style of singing. I personally thought this film was wonderful, the story was amazing, and I am only sad that I waited until it was on DVD to watch it!<br />Worth seeing, even if only once.
B00008KDHQ|5.0|I love this entire series, although the sequence was kind of weird. Over all though it was great action fun.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Her writing takes you back to this awful time in our history and makes you feel a part of it all. She is an excellent writer. A great piece of historical fiction.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|just order it . it was very good and consistent with the other movies. acting good of course. action good.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great book from Nicholas Sparks.  If you are a fan then this is one of the best he has written.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|feel good movie that stirs the soul. alot of memorable video game personalities in it. it was really good. nice!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great free app for the bible.  choose your version (kj,nkj,niv).  If all you want to do is read the bible, this is a great app.
0887307280|2.0|Ok, this book started off somewhat promising- I liked that he discussed how essential good organizing is, but then it all went to hell and he lost me. After reading the part about how franchises are organized, I was hoping for more of the same - perhaps with less rambling and more- get this- ORGANIZATION!<br /> Somewhere around the middle of the book, he goes off on a crazy long ramble about his own life, which included almost zero relevant information, it was pretty personal and dysfunctional. The rest of the book was pretty worthless, with long narrative off-putting \\"motivational speeches.\\"  I'm a business minded professional, so I don't need motivational preaching, I need more details regarding structure- he mentions absolutely nothing regarding numbers- NOTHING! I'm sorry, but knowing things like what you spend, what you receive, and whether you profit are really key. Being excited about your business isn't enough.
B005NWUSOI|5.0|The album is honestly one of my favorite albums. I glad I got it when I did.I don't know what else to say
B0040GR01M|3.0|Three days grace is a great band in general.  One-X is not as good as their earlier work but it is still rocking.
B008L1F91A|5.0|The Superman statue is excellent! Vibrant colors that are perfectly done. The base is sturdy and the magnets in the feet are a great touch to keep it upright. The cape is made of plastic, but it's also fantastic and in keeping with the overall quality of the piece. A must have for all the Superman collectors out there.
0783233477|4.0|Death takes a holiday was the original and in my humble opinion the better of the two movies.  Brad Pitt plays an unconvincing death in this remake of the classic movie.  Anthony Hopkins brilliantly plays the soul death comes to claim.  Death falls for the daughter and sticks around on earth for the majority of the story.  This remake was up dated to reflect the times but that took the mystique out of the story.  But My sister loves it so I got it for her.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It's great to see Daniel Craig at it again, reminding us why he is such a great Bond.<br /><br />The cinematography in Skyfall is spectacular, and unparalleled with any Bond film ever.<br /><br />This is a great one to watch again and again!
B004EPYZOO|5.0|So how much do you love your daughter?  Nicholas Cage loves his so much that he escapes from hell to avenge her death and rescue his grand child from the clutches of a devil worshiping cult.  Car chases and much violence follows.  Action packed from beginning to end and with a great twist.  There is actually a plot.
B005LAII80|5.0|Although this movie did not do well at the box office, this was a highly entertaining movie and should be seen by anyone a fan of action and beautiful imagery!<br /><br />The 3D is excellent, as well as the surround sound that comes with the Blu-ray.<br /><br />This movie is an experience more than it is a film!
0307744434|5.0|Opens at Nightfall<br />Closes at Dawn<br />Le Cirque des Rêves is circus unlike any other. Open only during the night this circus insinuates to be more than festive entertainment. Saturated with unbelievable acts and sights the colourless circus is to many, so much more<br /><br />But the circus carries a secret. Two magicians are battling each other to the death behind the scenes and every patron who walks in is at risk.<br /><br />I can honestly say with all sincerity, The Night Circus is unlike any book I have ever read. While I have read a great many stories, I've read of many fantasy worlds that can draw you right in, mysteries that can make your heart pound as if the story is truly real, and dystopian realities that can force you into survival mode, this book seems to be in a genre of its own. While dubbed a romance novel, I found this to be only partially true. It is really more of a dream put to ink.<br /><br />When I describe it as a dream, I do not mean fanciful daydreams or haunting nightmares. I mean the type of dream a reader might actually have. It is a strange tale, full of magic, duels, food, the circus, and surreal beauty. The novel felt so oddly familiar, though I knew it was from vague memories of my own dreams.<br /><br />To be fair, I am not sure I ever would have read this book on my own. It didn't seem to be the type of novel I tend to go for. Even while reading, it still felt slightly alien. Yet because of the insistence of several friends I took the plunge. I am thrilled I did. The pages draw you in deep until you feel at home. But the part I found the most satisfying of this tale was the ending. For such a fanciful sort of tale the conclusion bestowed solid meaning and purpose.
0670023329|5.0|Great book to show the real situation in N. Korea. Especially in the prison camps. It is hard to believer that people could treat others in such a way. May the way be opened that many more people could escape N. Korea and in the long run a proper government could be raise up that is by the people and for the people.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|It's too bad what the poor people of North Korea have to put up with. A regime change is way overdue and the Chinese should be ashamed for supporting this backwards uncivilized inbred despots in the 21st century. This is a good book and should serve as a major eye opener for the anti second amendment crowd.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game has a lot of potential and options. it can be hard to wait to recharge or get to the next round to earn more diamonds and coins. wish there was a bit more instruction but I do love the game!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I loved this cd, ive had it in my stereo for the last month and I haven't played anything else.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was the best season yet.  I like the willingness to keep the fans guessing and the unexpected cast and story changes.  I can't wait for season 4 to come out.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I am a huge Walking Dead fan and this season did not dissapoint. I just hate waiting so long for the next season. Would definately recommend to any Walking Dead, Sci Fi, Zombie, Action, Blood n Gore fans out there!
B005IFZ36I|5.0|Arrived right on time, perfect, brand new. Probably the best collection from one of my favorite american authors. If you love H.P. Lovecraft pick this up!
B003G4W49C|5.0|It has been close to 20 years since I read this book the first time. I suspect I have a very different point of view about the story arc and the use of children as tools now that I am a parent. I still very much identify with wanting to be in this world, of the adventure and experiences. On the second read, I was much more acutely aware of the ages of the children, and thought to myself that I would be hard pressed to believe that the children, as young as they were, would behave in many of the ways portrayed in the book. This time through, my wife and I reading it together, and she is a first time reader, so it will be interesting to get her point of view. The interplay of the differing roles that each of the Wiggin siblings play in this study of early onset sociopathy is an interesting one, though left largely unresolved between the brothers. I never read the last of the books in the quintet, so maybe I will read that one next, instead of Speaker for the Dead, as intended, as I have already read that one.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Great content, but really poor sound production.  Very difficult to understand the dialogue.  A real bummer!  This should not happen with technology today
B009ANP48G|5.0|This movies was very well done in 3D. All the dancing scenes look amazing. The sound is pretty good too.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|This browser works great on my little Emerson tablet.  I haven't had any problems and pages load seamlessly and quickly.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is incredible! There are no sex adds on my kindle fire. Five stars!<br />It is one of my currently favorite games! Thank you Romeo!!! Kids  Will love it!!
B0000524E5|5.0|This is what I asked for - I have nothing no nothing more to say  This is crazy to make me
B009JBZH54|5.0|This trilogy definitely lives up to all the hype. I was sad to see it end. The box set was perfect and makes a great gift as well.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|My daughter has loved everything Justin Bieber has done and follows his career closely. She absolutely loved this collection that Justin Bieber did.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|From start to finish I couldn't put the book down.  Once again I had to keep Turning  pages so I could find out what was happening next.  Unlike some books I've read before where the second book leaves me aggravated half way through, not with this one.  I liked the direction it went and look forward to the next.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Definitely had to listen to this CD multiple times before starting to really like it. It is not comparable to the previous songs DM made, however, are good songs after getting used to.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This games works flawlessly on my daughters children's tablet. It is addicting and very fun. Shel oved the original Fruit Ninja and this one was even funner.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Great movie staring Emma Watson. Not necessarily something for children, unless explained to them afterwards. Shows emotions, and what a teenager had and has to go through.
0765365278|5.0|I'm just about finished with my second read through of The Way of Kings, and it has been just as amazing an experience as going through it the first time.  I'm an avid reader, especially of fantasy, and this is by far my favorite book.  I've read Martin, Jordan, Goodkind, Rothfuss, Hobb, Erikson, Eddings, and so on.  I almost never re-read books, but I knew this is one I was going to, and was just making myself wait until the second book in the series was announced.  Now that Words of Radiance has been announced for November, I'm doing my re-read.  For Epic Fantasy, this book has it all.  Amazing world building, deep characters, and a great story.  I'm just hoping now that Brandon Sanderson has completed The Wheel of Time series, he will focus a lot more on this one.  It will be a 3+ year gap between the publishing of the first and second books in the series, and it's supposed to be a ten book series.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|Classic movie with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Enjoy watching it as it shows two good actors in one movie.
B0051CSIKQ|4.0|I liked this movie. It was post apocalyptic vampire horror drama. It literally combined all of them into one movie. I give it a thumbs up. It's not super gory, but a part or two are definitely horror mode. If you don't like horror, don't buy this. Otherwise I would recommend. It was never slow and even the parts that could be predictable were not enough to keep me from giving it a good score. It's one of the better ones I've seen lately.
B00001W9G0|4.0|this is a good show.  I had it on VHS and that tape wore out.  so this is an even better replacement.  I like the telling of how 2 peole were it reminds me of my younger days we would see this a lot.  the speeches and the marches, still goes on today but often any media coverage is now stopped, some people were doing things  just to get publicity and that is not the way to get changes any more.  then it did get some changes, sometimes.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The book was good. Very engrossed in their life and sort of imagined how it would be if it happened in this time period. I enjoyed it. I need more stories about the  other silos and the rest of Lukas, and Juliette.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love the weather and this app makes it easy to do! easy to understand graphics and easy access to videos and news stories.
B009VL28W2|5.0|James rocks! Metallica rocks! Umm. . . it's Metallica. . . .That pretty much sums it up. .  love it!!!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The story follows the books pretty well and the production value is what you would expect from an HBO original series.  I highly recommend it to any lover of Game of Thrones but even newbies will love this series.  A+
1416550534|5.0|After thoroughly enjoying The Forgotten Garden, I was anxious to get my teeth into another of Morton's novels, and I was certainly not disappointed with The House At Riverton.<br />Set in England in the vibrant 1920's, the story is told from the point of view of a young servant girl in a grand house, who becomes part of the family in more ways than she could have imagined. It follows the tragic twists in relationships between friends, family members, and ultimately the servant and her mistress. Rich in detail, beautifully written, with characters fleshed out so well they are almost visible, this is a truly wonderful read.<br />And if you are a fan of the \\"Downton Abbey\\" series, you won't want to miss this book! :)
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I've been using this for a few months on my kindle fires. All the other reviewers are correct with how well everything about the battery is displayed. The app is simple to use and very well worth the money spent. Thumbs up and thanks to the programmer. :)
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is a great show. This show is better than 2 and half men know that Charlie is not on the show.
B0091QS88K|4.0|It's fun, it's just that it gets boring very easily. I would love to get the full version, but its just that it's not free and I never get games that are not free. Other than that it's really fun!!! That's my opinion, what's yours? ;-)
B00BVMXBVG|4.0|Coma, Resident Evil series, Dark Angel  series, In all after some research there are only 20 human cloning TV and films ever made. Almost 300 including animals and monsters. So out of millions of films and TV  shows this subject matter is very rare. But the premise is at least interesting. All the comments I've read said the support clones where poorly developed. It takes time unless the actor has a feeling for a character from the start to create a new personna. So please give the lady a little understanding. They work between 10 and 14 hours a day. And as the actor playing the majority of roles they are demanding a lot of her. I have hope that the series will improve.<br /><br />A few bits of information you may not know. Cloning people is illegal in most countries because it is disruptive of the inheritance laws - so my bet is that is  why the women are being killed but it could be to hide their dark secret as well or it could be one of the women has a deep need to be the only one. Any of those possibilities well make a good story.<br /><br />Now I do have a complaint. I don't plain to ever buy a blue ray player and I'm a long time collector of DVD's. Please make DVD's available. Thank you.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I enjoy this app. And now since they have updated it... I can see the progression of the day in a quick glance.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|An amazing horror story! Season Two surpasses the excellence of the first season while maintaining a narrative in a completely unique setting with an enthralling plot!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A friend read the the book and thought it was great. I got it and could not put it down.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|What I really loved about this book is the women's perspective.  We rarely get to read or hear about what the women were doing during this time in history.  This adds a whole new dimension which makes the story more complete and well rounded.  There is also the insight to Lincoln's humanity as well as his strength and ability to lead the country through the most difficult time in it's history.
0440237688|5.0|Although considered to be a young adult book, I was caught up from the first page to the last.<br />Wonderful book for discussion - whatever the age
B0035WTJFW|5.0|If you like Tom Cruise and you like Sci Fi.  Then this movie is for you!<br />If you have a Blu-ray player, then take advantage of this Version of Minority Report.<br />Guaranteed to entertain you!
B00004X01U|3.0|three catchy songs and the rest are kind of a yawn fest.  I still rock out the her songs no matter what but this album was not my favorite of all her albums.
B006LA6IW2|4.0|I liked the conversational tone, almost as if Chris Kyle was talking to you one on one at your local watering hole. Really sad to hear of his passing recently.
B000002MUW|5.0|I love all the songs on this album, particularly Take a Bow, Inside of Me & Human Nature.  Oldie but goody and definately worth the price i paid.  I still listen to CD's in my car and opt not to have MP3 connection since I have my Ipod I use at the gym.  So I will be listening to the same music over and over again.
B000062XE1|3.0|Perhaps I didn't read the product description carefully enough - these were apparently the filmed versions of stage plays done in England. Not bad, well done even, but I had hoped, or ignorantly expected film versions. Again, they weren't badly done, but I gave the set away.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It is a great movie. and i was really excited to get it. the digital copy makes it easy to watch it anywhere.
B008YKRRH2|5.0|I have known these recordings for about 20 years now. While they are uneven in quality, I do feel they are all valid interpretations that deserve to be heard. Klemperer's Bruckner is quite plain, but he manages to instill profundity, even in the midst of technical shortcomings. It is highly unfortunate that Klemperer insisted on cuts in the Eighth, but there is a lot to admire even here. He manages to always get the right sound from the Philharmonia/New Philharmonia for Bruckner, something one shouldn't take for granted. This is an essential purchase for Klemperer fans and also those interested in Bruckner interpretation.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This show never lets down. You never know which way things will go. Great show. I can't wait for the next season
B004MNVKVO|4.0|RUSH Moving Pictures - Deluxe Edition [CD + Blu-ray] is pretty cool to listen and see in your car or home theater!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love this series. Constant twists and turns. Keeps you on your toes. A little let down however in the lack of battle scenes. And if there is a battle, you really see only bits and peices amongst every one talking. Great show though
0061726834|4.0|Steph's Review:<br />Okay, so I have a confession to make. You know how Requiem, book 3 of this series is already out? It's okay if you didn't. Let's just say I completely forgot about this series until one of my friends showed up at school with Requiem in hand, and I saw \\"Lauren Oliver\\" printed on the cover and thought it looked familiar. So I flipped through the book, saw the Delirium stuff, and I basically banged my head on the table because I couldn't believe I forgot to play catch-up on this series. I read Delirium around when it came out...and then I don't know what happened. I just never read Pandemonium, and I don't know what I was thinking when I skipped over it. I decided to be a good girl and give Delirium a re-read first before moving on, so here are my thoughts.<br /><br />This was a really solid beginning to this series. It is a romance-dystopia, and in this world, love is considered a disease. It's the most deadly one of all, that was the cause of other diseases such as depression, cancer, etc. Through tech advancements, they have been able to surgically alter the brain, and thus cure all people 18 years and older of \\"amor deliria nervosa\\", or love. Lena is just one of the everyday people taught to believe this, but her family holds a secret: her mother was infected, and the cure didn't work on her no matter how many time administered. It is their greatest shame and embarrassment, and they try to keep quiet about it as much as possible. Lena can't wait to get cured, because all her troubles will end. Well, enter Alex to the scene.<br /><br />Hot, gorgeous, and downright swoony, he makes Lena question everything she once believed. She really refuses to acknowledge her intrigue about him, having been taught to stay away from the boys at a young age. Thats the thing about love though right? You can't just ignore it and push it away, no matter how hard you try. I always love reading the moments when the protagonist of a dystopic book has that sparkling realization. When they figure out that everything their society tells them is horribly twisted and full of lies. I feel like this is when a character really blooms into a hero/heroine, and when the true plot of a dystopia series begins. Delirium is no exception, and when Lena realizes that love is the only thing that is right in her life, her character is completely changed into a true lovable protagonist.<br /><br />Delirium was very well written. Lauren Oliver's writing is weaved wonderfully in this book, which is probably one of the most enrapturing points. I admit I did not like Lena at first, because I felt like she was just blind. Maybe it's because we live in a world where love is held high, but she honestly annoyed me with all her crap about detesting love and wanting the cure. Once she opens up with Alex though, I loved her--being all rebel and sneaking in the corners. Alex. LOVE. HIM. I wish he were real, seriously, I want him to read poetry to me or something (and that's really weird because I unfortunately don't quite have an appreciation for poetry...). Delirium is a little lacking in action until the end of the book, but just watching Lena be resculpted was enough to keep me engrossed.<br /><br />The ending broke my heart omg. It's one of those endings where you can't believe what's happening. It's like HUGE PLOT TWIST--The End. It took me awhile to come to terms with it, even though it was my second time reading it, and somehow I feel really thankful this series has been completely written. Reading Pandemonium next, which I should have a review up for soon! I absolutely have to finish this series, and find out the fate of Lena, Alex, and this society.<br /><br />--Steph @ A Walk on Wordsalization.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|It was a good movie. Thought it could have went another way but still worth watching. I give it 4 stars
B00APUQT7I|5.0|My whole family enjoyed this movie, especially the younger kiddos. We plan on having an Ice Age night soon. :)
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I'm an occasional user of Facebook (I know, I'm a minority out there), and it works pretty well for what I mainly use it for. The only problem I have had, and it is annoying, is that it will just go blank and take me back to my home screen (I use on my Kindle HD tablet) and then I have to go back and start over. I mainly use this app for acquiring coupons from companies (not only am I am infrequent Facebook freak, I'm one of those crazy coupon ladies!)
B000FC146C|5.0|I Loved the movie years ago and I Loved the book! I had forgotten a lot of the details. As always, got a lot more out of reading the book than I did from the movie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing read. I couldn't put it down!  Flynn is constantly keeping her readers on their toes. Eonderul read an again, amazing.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|If you want to listen to what is going on around you, then this is the item to get....number 1!
B0010T75W6|2.0|If you aren't into \\"artsy\\" films, here meaning a nonlinear story, random monologues, weird shots and very little exposition, this movie is not for you.  Going by that it's not for me either, but I was persuaded to watch it by the promise of good music and in that area, at least, I suppose it delivers.  The songs in H&TAI have to convey a lot of the story as well as being properly \\"deep\\" and what I'd normally call pretentious, but whoever wrote them is a good lyricist and they're better crafted than any other aspect of the movie.  The music, too, is well-written to the point that none of it would sound out of place on the radio (with different words, sometimes, perhaps).  There's not really that many songs total, however.<br /><br />Regarding the movie as a whole, I'm ambivalent.  Hedwig's story is interesting, but my gosh are aspects of it creepy.  To be clear, it's not really the characters themselves who weird me out; rather, it's the typical art movie stuff they get up to.  Being gay (or transexual?) and having a botched operation?  Not creepy.  Lying in ruins and walking through streets naked, seducing a younger man with candy, and masturbating the teenage brother of a child you're babysitting?  All creepy as hell.  Nobody says or does anything natural seeming, cause that wouldn't be creative enough I guess.<br /><br />I think I could say good things about the main character's acting, if I saw more evidence of it.  There's very little non-monolouging dialogue, but the actor conveys some pretty honest seeming emotions (mostly crippling depression).  The same goes for some of the others as well.  The movie as a whole has a sort of flat tone, even when people are yelling or playing fairly hard-rocking songs.  I think it's an attempt at sophistication through extreme stylization.  You've got to read a lot into every small action to actually get a story out of this series of musical numbers and anecdotes.  Alternatively you can just look at the pretty pictures.<br /><br />I don't care about the movie's philosophy on love, truth and the power of rock or whatever it's trying to say.  I wanted to get to know Hedwig, but I don't feel like the movie shows us enough of her to let that happen.  I also wanted to like Hedwig and I kind of hated her (him, by the end?).  Like many people, I entirely lost the thread of the last few scenes.  Dunno if they even happened; they could have been a dream sequence.  Overall I don't find the movie very memorable, but I do have some suggestions as to who might like to watch it.  Basically, if you got all the way through Velvet Goldmine you should enjoy Hedwig just fine.  I... actually can't think of another audience who would appreciate it.  It's rated highly on Amazon, though, so don't mind me if you like and give it a shot.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was a real page turner. I loved the way it toggled between court transcript and narrative, keeping the reader keenly aware that there was more to the story than meets the eye.
B004SKLFJS|5.0|Would recommend to  anyone who likes dance, IRISH STEP DANCING in particular. Very well filmed and choreographed. Two thumbs up!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great read and very well written and thought out.  I recommend this book a lot to friends and family.
0345803485|5.0|Very interesting. A great way to escape into another world. It's definitely a girls fantasy. Thanks for sending it promtly
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Waited a long time for the extended version to come out. I am a great Twilight fan and was not disappointed at all. I really hate to see the series end.
030758836X|4.0|Amy and Nick have been having marital problems, and when Amy disappears amid suspicion, Nick is the prime suspect of what is a suspected murder.<br /><br />This was a tough one to review. While it was well-written, clever, and engaging (keeping me reading, wondering what was going to happen next), there was something ultimately unlikable about it.<br /><br />This book is written in the perspective of Nick, who is reeling from the disappearance of his wife on their anniversary, and the diary entries of Amy. Amy's diary entries take you through the years leading up to their anniversary, both the good and the bad, and it becomes clear that there was a lot of bad. Things don't look good for Nick, who seems to be a self-serving, self-centered worthless husband, and the evidence mounts against him, making it appear that he did indeed kill his wife and dump her body. But did he? You're never quite sure. And at other times you aren't even sure he is really such a bad guy. At times he seems genuinely confused and grieving.<br /><br />This is one of those stories that has you going this way and then that, like a Dateline murder mystery. Yes, he did it! Wait, no, I don't think he did do it. Yes, he did! No, he didn't. Back and forth.<br /><br />The characters were very well developed slowly throughout the story, the storyline was a winding road looping around on itself. There were a few plot points that were kind of preposterous, but overall it was a pretty enjoyable story.<br /><br />My final word: When I asked myself what it was I didn't like about this story, I found the answer was simple: the characters. I couldn't stand them. By the end of the story, I was sick of them both and glad to be rid of them! But the story itself was pretty well-crafted and very clever. Overall I would recommend this story if you like to be kept guessing.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Fabulous app for anytime you need a little down time, very helpful for those nights you have trouble falling asleep.
0061950726|4.0|Molly is a troubled teen. She's been in and out of foster homes for years, and has learned if you don't depend on anyone, then you won't be let down. After getting herself in a little trouble, she is ordered to perform community service, and finds herself helping an elderly woman sort through boxes of memories in her attic.<br /><br />Molly is troubled, but likable. And there is something special there. It's just that no one has taken the time to see her for who she really is. When she is given the opportunity to perform her community service assisting an elderly woman clean out her attic, she figures she'll just bide her time and get it over with as quickly and painlessly as possible. What she doesn't expect is to find a friend.<br /><br />91-year-old Vivian knows that she has reached the end of her life, and it is the perfect time to sort through old boxes that hold old memories. As she sorts through boxes, we are led through Vivian's troubled past as an orphan, shipped cross-country by train from New York to Minnesota in hopes of finding her a home.<br /><br />I was more fond of the scenes from the 30s than the current moments between Vivian and Molly. I often found the present-day scenes to be somehow unrealistic-- particularly the scenes between Molly and her foster parents.<br /><br />The moments between Vivian and Dutchy were touching. The heartbreaks that this little girl endured were devastating and hard to read. You keep hoping she will catch a break and find some happiness and security.<br /><br />You can see the parallels between Vivian and Molly, and as you hoped for the best for the young and vulnerable Vivian, you also find yourself hoping that Molly will find happiness and a place to call home.<br /><br />My final word: I thought the scenes from Vivian's youth were fabulous! The scenes from Molly's interactions with her foster family seemed to lack...credibility. I liked the relationship that develops between Molly and Vivian, even though near the end some of their interactions seem a little hokey and overdone. Overall I really enjoyed this story, but mostly for the glimpses of the young hapless Vivian. The jumps to present day actually continually pulled me out of the story that I was immersed in, and the move felt somewhat awkward. They felt too much like two different stories.  An \\"A\\" for the flashback scenes, a \\"C\\" for the present day scenes, giving it a \\"B\\" overall.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|It was an excellent movie.  Exactly what I expected.  Arrived in a timely matter.  This movie rocks!  I lived in Santa Cruz for many years.  Nice to see the scenery.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's the same as any other facebook app for android, like the one I have on my Samsung Galaxy S2... I just wish there was an option to make the font bigger!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Love the story and the the actors make it a really good production. Good evening entertainment if you like history.
0375869026|5.0|My son loved the book. He was so happy when the book arrived. My 9 year old son is reading chapter books, and he told me of a book his teacher commented on that was a great story about a boy and his facial difference from other boys, but the child is like any other kid. My son has read this book many times.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I've had my kindle over a year and this is by far the best book I've read for the price. I couldn't put this down and couldn't wait to get back to it when I had to.

1401235417|5.0|Like other long-standing characters, Batman has an established universe in which he exists. Though the faces and costumes may change, you know there will always be a Joker, there will always be a Robin, there will always be a Batgirl. Adding to this canon can not be an easy feat. What Snyder has done is created an entire layer of Gotham that none have seen before (even Batman is incredulous), and he adds it so effortlessly and seamlessly to the world of the Bat-folk, that it's as if it always existed. The Court of Owls is my favorite Bat-storyline, bar none. Not only is the story historically significant for Batman, not only does it fit like a missing puzzle piece in the DC mythos, but it is also so very well written that it puts most other comics writers to shame. Scott Snyder got in to Bruce's/Batman's head, and never has that voice been written with such spot-on clairty. I'm a Snyder fan for life now.<br /><br />(As an aside, I met Snyder at the 2013 comiccon in Seattle - he was incredibly humble, gracious, and thankful.)<br /><br />If you want to see him in another genre, try &#34;Severed,&#34; his foree into horror graphic novels.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Amazing. I would love to see him live.What a talented musician. If only he had more tour dates in the north east...
B003NX6ZDC|2.0|I really enjoyed the track Crossfire, that said the rest of the collection doesn't do much for me. Prefer his work with the Killers especially the Sam's Town album.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|I purchased this Sony USB turntable a few months ago. It reminds me of my first record player when I was growing up. It's great that technology has invented a way for us to preserve our vinyl and this turntable is also cabaple of playback through your computer's speakers but I have yet to figure that out. The product is delicate and not as sturdy as I had thought. It's always good to keep the needleguard down when not in use a the slightest bump to the START button will engage the tonearm and if there is no record on the platter, this will ruin your needle as it rubs on the rubber mat. That's just common sense, something that I have an issue with at times. Please be aware that if you need to replace the stylus, it almost costs as much as the entire unit, around $96.00.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I totally like (and can relate to) the story behind this movie. Seeing it in animation helped me gain new prospective on a lot of things.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I thought it was riveting on-the-edge-of-your-seat action, good humor, and with a magnificent plot!<br />I will definitely recommend this to all my friends.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|All my other sleep apps work fine. Have deleted and reinstalled several times. It works for a few nights then audio shuts down on phone sleep, timer still counts down. Really liked this app but this is a real problem to rate it any higher.<br />DROID RAZR max hd

I've installed and uninstalled at least 1/2 dozen times and resent the amount of my time that's been wasted.<br /><br />I'm removing this non-functioning MP3 \\"Cloud\\" player app, which doesn't work anyway, for good from my Samsung Galaxy SII. Keeps telling me to try again when connected to the internet - I AM connected to the internet (happens with my home wi-fi and the built in cell phone internet connection,) and that there is a server failure Error #151 when I try to access the Cloud where my previous purchases supposedly are, although as someone else mentioned it sures lets me get to the music store!<br /><br />It DOES recognize albums I have copied over to my phone SD card from my laptop (for testing,) but I don't need that to work, there are other players already built into the phone that function quite adequately, thank you very much, if I did want to play music on my phone.<br /><br />Very very very disappointed in Amazon..who must have jobbed this app out because I have more faith in their attention to quality and customer treatment than this product reflects.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I find this game very entertaining and it really makes you think about  what you are doing.  The game occupies my mind and I enjoy collecting coins and buying new characters.
0312330537|5.0|When a friend loaned me his copy of this book, I wanted to say, \\"Friends don't give friends 900-page books.\\" But I was hooked from the first page, and sad when this ripping good tale was over.  In particular, the author does an amazing job making Bombay come to life, and allowing the reader to feel the same love for the city that he obviously feels.  I have lived for long stretches in other countries, and I have also fallen for the charms of other down-at-the-heels cities.  Roberts' descriptions sing--literally--and show the reader amazing views of Bombay that an ordinary tourist would never see.  His characters were extremely well-drawn, from their faces to their myriad ways of speaking English.  The situations were incredible but somehow believable, so good were the descriptions.  I laughed, I cried, and I never got bored.  Too many books these days are in desperate need of cutting down to size, but I cannot say any part of this one was superfluous.  There was easily enough content in Shantaram for three books.  Knowing that parts of it are autobiographical only increased my fascination.  Count me as another of the fans who are eagerly awaiting both the sequel, and the prequel, not to mention a movie.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I may be a zombie nut, but I love this show.<br />This is the best series to hit tv in a long time.<br />You need to watch it from season 1 to get the feel of all the characters.<br />Season 3 rocked, lots of zombie killing.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a strong, independent, relatively successful woman myself, raised to believe I could do anything I set my mind to, I was floored by how many points in this book hit home. Kudos to Sheryl Sandberg for voicing them, especially in such a public forum...and thank you!!<br /><br />She's right. We don't talk about this...women, men...no one talks about this. I know I don't. At work. At home. With our friends. Sure, we complain once in awhile, we grumble, we mutter under our breath about it. We get our hackles up when we see our male counterparts still earning more, still achieving more success in the workplace, still holding the majority of the top corporate leadership positions...but we continue to perpetuate the cycle by believing the fight is over.<br /><br />As a fairly new mom who's been earning my own paycheck for about 25 years, I didn't even realize how many of my recent decisions had been affected by fear and acceptance of the status quo until I read this book. I wish she had written this before I had a kid -- it may have helped me make better choices. And I will absolutely make sure my own daughter reads this when she gets older.<br /><br />The fight it not yet over!

0152067043|5.0|Our 2-yo daughter loves sheep, so I ordered this on a whim while getting a few other books. It has not disappointed. She loves to read it every single night before bed - and sometimes other times as well. The text is short on each page, and lets her follow along (she almost memorized most of it in just a few days), and she gets very excited (yes, every time), wondering where the green sheep will be. She has shared this with our dogs and cat as well, having determined that they, too, must be excited to find out where the green sheep has gone (she sits on the floor and reads it to them). So happy she enjoys it so much!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The history which is revealed while telling the story of the Grantham family and their staff is the most fascinating part for me. There is all the personal drama of course, which makes the story so interesting, but seeing how they all live, and what is going on at the time, is the best part. The names and dates we learn in history class can't hold a candle to a really good story for making it easy to absorb.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Reality has a way of bringing truth to the surface.  The story picks up again from where it left us hanging at the end of Book 1.  The personalities show their deep feelings, needs and prospects for the future, just what we were all breathlessly waiting to spew forth.<br /><br />A little hard to believe that two people are so in tune to each other's most wanton needs 24/7.
B009G45M4A|5.0|It's taken 13 years for me to fully realize how much of a Converge fan I am. Maybe I found the music at the right time or maybe I just need to exorcise a few things. From beginning to end the album doesn't let up once in intensity. Maybe I enjoy ti too much, if that is possible. I am very happy to have brought myself to the album, and to the band, to find something else that expresses so much in such a beautifully intense way.

0062014536|5.0|*mild spolier in here* (not big, but sort of, if you liked Raven)<br /><br />This book was an amazing end to the series. It leaves you hanging however. Don't get me wrong it was a satisfying end, but there were loose ends. Just enough to keep you thinking about the book for a long time. You can see who she ended up with, but Lauren Oliver doesn't say it outright. So often did I get frustrated at one particular character, who was never that cold in the first book! If you don't want to be devastated by what happened to Raven, read the novella Raven before this book... you'll understand that she's alive, just ran away with Tack :) Tack is my favorite character, besides Alex. Julian reminded me of a big baby, although I didn't like it when Lena treated him like one. Anyway READ THIS BOOK. no matter if you didn't like Pandemonium. read it.
B00947N6UG|5.0|I bought this movie for my son and we couldn't be more happy with it. It's difficult to find a \\"cartoon\\" that's clean and fun for both adults and kids (boys). There was enough action to keep my teenager interested, it was boyish (no princesses) enough for my youngest and funny enough for me to watch it a few times.<br /><br />The story line is well written and the characters are very entertaining. I never would have guessed that Alec Baldwin played the \\"Russian\\" Santa. He does a fantastic job! All the characters are interesting and likable - even the villain.<br /><br />I would recommend this for all ages - but it might be a little scary for 5 and younger.

B004LZFWJO|5.0|This game is super addictive. I orignially had downloaded the free version, but it did not take more long to realize that the full version was worth the small amount that I paid for it.

I like to play it while i am waiting for an appointment.

B007KGXY0K|1.0|When I purchased this motherboard, I did not realize that this motherboard has a SMBus coonector (a 5-pin VERY special and rare connector). I purchased two power supplies (not cheap) and them and many other that I have seen on internet lacks this VERY special SMBus.<br /><br />When I asked for a power supply that meet this requirement to Asus techical support service I received inconsistent responses. All enginners told me that they do not know about any power supply that meet this requirement. One of the engineers told me that if I would leave this connector without connection, the motherboard could damage. Other one told me that he does not know what happend if I would leave this without connection. And a third one told me that it would be fine without this connector.<br /><br />If Asus techincal support does not know what about this, I cannot know that by myself. Very bad!<br /><br />Update 2013-05-02<br />=================<br />The driver for Win8 x64 corresponding to the C600 LSI RAID does not install. It returns an error saying that is it not for this operating system.<br /><br />A guy from Asus who contacted me, through this (Amazon) \\"Commenting system\\", has been trying to solve the problem for more than two weeks without any success. The last communication from him was about a week ago.<br /><br />There is another pending problem with the Marvell RAID 1 volume. It is EXTREMELY slow and unstable. When I move an amount of 1 TB to/or from the Marvell RAID 1 volume, the operation aborts constantly and it caused (once) a damage in some files (which I lost). I have not opened the corresponding ticket to Asus technical support because I am waiting to solve the current problem (with \\"LSI RAID\\" driver). This unstable behavior in the Marvell RAID 1 volume is present in Win7 x64 and Win8 x64.<br /><br />My Marvell RAID 1 is made of two identical model 3TB HDs.<br />I will update this comment when new info(conclusion be generated.<br /><br />Update 2013-05-08<br />=================<br />Asus technical support service has told me that the only one way to install successfully the Win8 x64 C600 LSI RAID driver is creating a Floppy installation disk. No way to do it from the downloaded driver file.<br /><br />Marvell RAID 1 Volume performance and instability issues is still not solved.<br /><br />Update 2013-05-30<br />=================<br />It had pass 12 business days since my request to Asus Tech Support and I have not received any communication from them. Only silence.<br /><br />Update 2013-07-06<br />=================<br />Jeffrey (the Asus Tech Support) agent who contacted me through this Amazon review comment, just never answer any of my e-mails anymore. He just avoid to answer to my mails.<br /><br />I think that Amazon should allow to give ZERO stars, because some products/services really deserve that.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I read this to my two boys ages 13 and 11.  We have read dozens of books. This one is at the top of the list.  The only other books on par with this one were The Maze Runner and Ender's Game.  My kids would beg to read longer.  I had to do a little real-time editing of the language, but nothing big.<br /><br />I graduated High School in 1989.  So, I loved all the references to 80s pop culture and computer arcana.  It was a great way to talk to my kids about the \\"good old days.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.

0374533571|4.0|This book was so laugh out loud funny.  I did, at certain points, feel bad about laughing.  Mental illness is nothing to laugh about but the author just wrote a great story.  Having some insight to an issue that I've never had to deal with was a real eye opener.  Great supporting characters as well.  Love Pat's mom!  My only issue with the story was that the end was fairly predictable.  Recommend to all!!!!
B007SRZULW|5.0|Impossible to review as there are literally thousands of reviews available at the push of a button of this absolute classic of English literature. The hardest part about putting this review together? Scrolling through hundreds of book cover images finding the one, for me,  that encapsulated everything about this book. So we have impeccable dressing and manners, order and simplicity, elegance and refinement, beautifully weaved layers, and above all love.<br /><br />In January it was 200 years since 'Pride and Prejudice' was first published. 200 years! Can you believe the timelessness of this story. So it was fitting that I finally read it. Only a few years ago I thought it was about time I read a Jane Austen, so on the advice of a Jane Austen fanatic I read 'Emma'.  Not a good choice. Emma annoyed me intensely, the two movie versions I have seen did nothing to change my opinion and although I finished the book, I did feel the whole exercise was a bit of waste of time. I wasn't going to take up my friend's suggestion of 'Northanger Abbey'. Why she didn't suggest P&P I'll never know. Because it is head and shoulders above 'Emma', as are the movie/TV versions.<br /><br />We know what is going to happen of course, but it doesn't matter as the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy is so delicately and skilfully developed, the reader feels the tension between the them, sees the gradual awakening and realisation as they slowly get to know each other. It is so brilliant, that I found once they had arrived at the true state of affairs, I sort of lost interest in their relationship. I had got to know them so well as separate individuals I wasn't really very interested in reading about them as a loved-up couple!<br /><br />Then of course there are the periphery characters - so overdrawn really as to be ridiculous. The appalling obsequious Mr Collins, over wrought Mrs Bennet, that silly Lydia, head in the sand Mr Bennet, terrifying Lady Catherine, unlovable rogue Wickham, amongst others.<br /><br />So brilliant plot, great characters and to top it off wonderful writing. You might think the written English of 200 years ago could be hard going. It is certainly different from how we write today, but I can't really imagine this book being written in modern English. Its charm and magic is as much in the language used as in the other components. We only need to see Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth in full Regency articulation to appreciate the beauty and appropriateness of Miss Austen's language.<br /><br />Most highly recommended for anyone looking to get lost in another time with a story as appropriate for today as it was 200 years ago.ngst others.<br /><br />So brilliant plot, great characters and to top it off wonderful writing.

B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book is a big-hearted, warm, and charming tale that blends old and new.  An out-of-work young, geeky designer/tech guy takes a job as the overnight clerk at a strange San Francisco bookstore.  He eventually discovers that the bookstore is part of a centuries old secret society that believes the secret to immortality is contained in a series of books filled with code.  Being a curious and enterprising fellow, the clerk recruits some techie friends to use technology to crack the code contained in the books.  Eventually, the massive brain and computer power of Google is in on the effort.  The portrayal of tech firms in general and Google in particular is outlandish in a really fun way and pushes this book a little bit into the category of fantasy.<br /><br />The story is told in the first person by the young bookstore clerk.  He's a good-hearted guy with a terrific sense of humor.  The book was charming and fun.  Every once in a while it's nice to read a novel makes you feel good and doesn't contain violence or graphic sex (not that there's anything wrong with that!).  If you're in the mood for a fun and quirky mystery, this book is for you.  If you're from the SF Bay Area, you'll really appreciate the depiction of the tech firms as well as the SF setting.<br /><br />My only minor criticism is that the book lacked a strong feeling of danger or suspense that would compel you to stay up all night to finish it.  Terrorists weren't about to destroy the world.... Children's lives weren't in danger... Nothing of that sort would happen if the mystery wasn't solved.  For that reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  But I still enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It's so simple - but I use it all the time, and its one of the few apps that I think is essential.  It keeps you informed about your battery, but it is not invasive like many other monitoring apps you may have tried.  You forget it there, until you need it.
B003TJ4YU6|3.0|The 5.1 Surround audio mix was uneven, and the sound quality was terrible.

1400069289|5.0|The book is intriguing by using many true stories. It is helpful to understand habits and build/change whatever you want. The last two chapters are a bit too long, especially the part defending the addictive gambler. Overall, it is a very good book.

1455869910|2.0|I was really excited to read this book. I had heard great things about it. I work at a pediatric hospital and many of my coworkers had read it. I will admit that I read the book in about 3 days. It was hard to put down but throughout it I found myself annoyed with the characters more than anything. I did appreciate some of the struggles/stereotypes that they talked about that cancer kids deal with. I just felt that the characters complained/whined/made fun of everything. Everyone said they cried reading this book and I didn't even come close to shedding a tear. I think I was just annoyed and ready to be finished with it. It just didn't live up to the hype for me.

0062012339|5.0|I'll start by saying I was born after the heyday of Hair Bands and grew up when boy bands had their second act in the early 2000's. Fortunately, I have always loved music, no matter what decade it came from and Motley is no exception. However, their life stories and how they came to be was not something I had much detail on. This book opened my eyes to the wonderful beast that is Motley and I was captivated from the first sentence. This book transports you to the seat next to Mick, Nikki, Vince and Tommy as their stories unfold. You feel like you are running around The Whisky, watching a large red haired woman have her way as well as sitting in a van, that smells of something foul and being in on a joke that I hope Tommy's mom never figured out. This was an amazing book and I found myself truly saddened when the book ended as my ride was over. A true MUST READ for all.

I really recommed Maniscrupt found in Accra to all those we need to see life with new hope and need to find the right values to buil it. It is also a book to give away to those you love. Paulo is finally giving us his sword as he himself says in the book: \\"this is not a peace deal is a sword to fight for a better world\\".

B002VQ7PVS|4.0|This was a fast paced espionage tale recounted primarily by flashbacks from an aging spy's memoirs given to her daughter in the mid 1970s.  The story alternates smoothly between the war years and the 70s.  The daughter is stunned to learn of her mother´s secret past, which turns out could be catching up with her.  There are enough double-crosses and murders to keep fans of the genre satisfied and the ending brought things to a clean end, which is something you don't always get. One thing I found odd was a number of characters that ended up having no significant role in the plot. I kept wondering what the present day connection would be with the past, but it turned out there really wasn't any connection.

0230755062|4.0|\\"A mesmerizing, moving, and elegantly written debut novel, \\"The Language of Flowers\\" beautifully weaves past and present, creating a vivid portrait of an unforgettable woman whose gift for flowers helps her change the lives of others even as she struggles to overcome her own troubled past. The Victorian language of flowers was used to convey romantic expressions: honeysuckle for devotion, asters for patience, and red roses for love. But for Victoria Jones, it's been more useful in communicating grief, mistrust, and solitude. After a childhood spent in the foster-care system, she is unable to get close to anybody, and her only connection to the world is through flowers and their meanings.  Now eighteen and emancipated from the system, Victoria has nowhere to go and sleeps in a public park, where she plants a small garden of her own. Soon a local florist discovers her talents, and Victoria realizes she has a gift for helping others through the flowers she chooses for them. But a mysterious vendor at the flower market has her questioning what's been missing in her life, and when she's forced to confront a painful secret from her past, she must decide whether it's worth risking everything for a second chance at happiness.\\"<br /><br />The Language of Flowers was a really interesting book. I loved it, though I didn't Love it. The whole concept that the book is based upon is so fascinating, the idea that flowers can have symbolic meanings. There is also a dictionary of the meanings in the back (at least in the UK edition, which I read and which is pictured on right). The characters in this one are also really, really amazingly portrayed, and the book can be so moving at times.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers paints a sobering picture of what life as a foster child is like. I don't know if it's accurate or universal, but it was compelling. And certainly some aspects of it must be universal. Every other chapter is the story of when Victoria was nine and was with a fosterparent named Elizabeth, and the things that happened there. The other chapters are set in the present day, when Victoria is eighteen and exchanging flower messages with the flower vendor.<br /><br />The writing in this book is quietly beautiful, like the trillium, which apparently means modest beauty. I love trilliums, by the way. At any rate, the language of flowers and the language in this book was so great. I loved the concept, the plot, and the way it was executed.<br /><br />I thought that this book looked interesting a while ago, but I didn't get around to it until now. I wish I had read it sooner. I learned a lot, was entertained, and was moved. I wanted to see what the terrible thing was that had happened, I wanted to learn more about Victoria, and I wanted her to be happy, to surmount her troubles.<br /><br />There are so many different strands, so many different vines to this story, but it didn't feel thorny or forced. It felt right. The analogies relating to flowers worked, and this novel was really poignant. I would definitely recommend it. It's realistic fiction, I suppose.<br /><br />My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com

0451232577|5.0|Follett is amazing. This is the beginning of the 2nd series of his books that our book club has read. Extraordinary details and research of history interwoven with personal family lives, each character becoming someone we get to know intimately. Another book one cannot put down for wanting to keep turning the pages to discover what happens nest.

B007XT4AMA|4.0|I saw her perform on &#34;Live from Daryl's House&#34;. I had never heard of her but am glad I saw that performance. I've listened to the CD on my Bose and in my vehicle cd player and the words do not sound very clear to me on either. I'm going to look for other cd's by Rumer and hope the words are a bit more clear. My opinion is that she is the next Adele. They sing the same kind of songs that can move you to tears or make you really do some thinking. I would love to see the two perform each other's songs together!! That would be a &#34;killer&#34; show!! Keep following her - she's going &#34;nowhere but up&#34;!!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I first started watching this series in March. With Amazon Prime, I had access to the first two seasons that I watched in full over a two-three week period. To completely catch up, I purchased the Blue Ray of season three and was not disappointed. I highly recommend Downton.
B002C6K7NA|5.0|This has to be one of their best! Loved the God and Guns song which we all heard before the CD came out but discovered more songs that have so much meaning. Can't stop playing &#34;That Ain't My America&#34;, &#34;Southern Ways&#34;, and &#34;Unwrite That Song&#34;! Worth having in anyone's collection who like Skynyrd
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I will admit that I am not a huge Tolkien fan, but I read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I thought The Hobbit the better of the two stories. That being said, I like Peter Jackson's treatment of the Lord of the Rings very much and was excited to hear that he was directing The Hobbit. As the title of this review suggests, I thought the movie was decent. However, it occurs to me that The Lord of the Rings was told in three movies, one for each book. The Hobbit, a much shorter simpler story is also going to be three movies, the first of which is almost four hours. It seems to me that some editing might be in order here, as this movie feels more like cinematic masturbation than film making.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|Sadly I found it a bit simple, But I liked the game. I also appreciate the hint section I. Game. IF one gets stuck you can get a little bump without learning all. ALSO I didn't see the hallway in. Chapter two right away. If the hint section hadn't mentioned that there was a clue to fine there I'd have been stuck. But once you get an object it's easy to figure out the use, unlike some other games where you wander about foolishly.

0385344333|4.0|A wanted Man by Lee Child was just what I needed after reading four books in a row that weren't so great.  I read a lot, so when I get a string of poorly executed ideas I get really cranky and irregular.  Two of those books were written by well known authors and huge disappointments, so I was relieved to find Reacher, being Reacher.  I read the reviews panning the book and don't quite understand where they are coming from, I thought it was great.  The bad guys had a really awesome hideout, the women were INTELLIGENT and attractive and Reacher played the game by his own rules, as usual.  There was a lot of car travel, but enough was going on to keep it interesting.  Lee Child is a wonderful writer and Reacher is a great character, so I am hoping if the author is looking for a change, he will just let Reacher catch up on his sleep while he invents other characters to lead us through the literary landscape of escape fiction.  I need people like Child writing books to keep my world rocked!
B00821OUT6|3.0|this show seems to be more dialogue than real action and the theme<br />is that the aliens are more mechanical than humanoid. the plot does not<br />seem realistic at all. the sci-fi aspect should be better, does not<br />show much imagination.

B009RI4ZKC|2.0|Not at all the light-hearted comedy we expected from the promos.  Disturbing...kids stabbing kids, a dog gets shot with an arrow, packs of scouts acting blood-thirsty.  Just not well-written, either.  Too many odd, pointless story lines muddy up the script, like adults having affairs with each other and another scout camp that appears out of no where, like a second thought.  And the stars aren't novel or eclectic, they're just violently disturbed or depressed children.  Editing, lighting, filming...even the idea of the narration were excellent.  Just a bad story based on a good idea that tries too hard to be deep and meaningful.

1439153663|4.0|As an Alabama native, I am a huge fan of Southern literature and also one of its toughest critics. This novel impressed me with its honesty. Grissom does an excellent job developing her characters throughout the novel. They are well-rounded and believable, and they themselves are interesting enough to make for a good story. Yes, somehow the book drags on a bit at points  even though the story unfolds at a well-timed pace. But, unlike \\"The Help,\\" which for deep Southerners  stated the obvious and was poorly written, \\"The Kitchen House\\" adds an element to the Old South story that is largely uknown. The dialogue is true to life, and the story pulls you in from the beginning. I will be recommending this one to friends.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is amazing for my daughter for her hand and eye coordination.she loves the upgrades and tries all the time to get three limited time people oh and boards.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very unique book... Never read one quite like it. Comical, quirky humor throughout. It's about a 100 year old man who ditches his retirement home hours before his birthday party, where the mayor and local press will be present. The story is half about what happens after he climbs out the window, and the other half is about his entire life prior to his 100th birthday. The chapters predating his escape from the retirement home (majority of the book) are like a Swedish Forrest Gump story (this book is Swedish). Allan travels the world and meets many presidents, prime ministers, world leaders, etc. Very funny and entertaining. I highly recommend it.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|An excellent addition to Wagner lovers collections. Wagner's Dream DVD is also included.  It gives background material on the Robert Lepage's  development of this unusual and interesting production
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|This book was slightly disappointing. It had a promising premise, but the book wasn't what I expected. It's about a depressed old man with marital issues who walks cross-country in England because one of his former co-workers writes him a letter, explaining that she is dying of cancer. He gets the idea that walking to her will help save her. Sure, it's not plausible at all, but that's why it's called unlikely in the title. The book synopsis' (what is the plural version of synopsis?) that I read said that the book is about all the interesting people he meets on his journey. That sounded pretty interesting. It wasn't that great though. Half the book is the main character trying to make us feel bad for him by thinking about all his past mistakes & issues with his wife and son. Too much emotion in this book. Many people love books like this, but it wasn't for me.

It's not that the world would be healed and all things made new if everyone just read it, it's that this book is so beautiful, really gem-like in the way it brings together the beauty and pain of being alive, that not reading it would mean missing out on something that makes our limited days on this planet more sweet and more vital.

1476733953|5.0|I'll be honest with you, I was wary about picking up Wool. I had read about Hugh Howey and his unconventional path to success. I had read about him because I wanted to be him. I still do. I needed someone to look up to as a broke out of technical academic writing and moved into what I always wanted to do - science fiction.<br /><br />I was wary because I, along with so many other people, had been told that unless a book goes through the traditional publishing route, it won't be good. We have always just assumed that books on the shelf at the bookstore had to be the best the writing world had to offer because they know what good writing looks like. While its true that many self-published books lack polish and, sometimes, grammar basics, there is some serious talent in the writing world that gets missed because the gatekeepers didn't like it. Thanks to Wool by Hugh Howey, I have found a respect for all routes of publishing. It gives me so much hope for the stories that don't get told.<br /><br />I found Wool on the bookshelf of my local book store a few days before its official release. I was in the bookstore writing my own book and had just finished scouring Hugh Howey's blog for idea about how to make it work. Then is dawned on me - how could I possibly hope to have success in the indie author world if I hadn't read many of their book. So, I picked up Wool and went home.<br /><br />Now, before you read the official review portion below, I want you to know that I'm striving not to have any spoilers included. Because of that, if you haven't read the book and have only looked at the reviews, I'm going to sound like a twelve year old girl because of the emotions the book invoked in me. You'll understand if you read it and then I'll challenge you not to sound like one as well as you explain it.<br /><br />Opening the book with caution, I read the first two pages and stopped. I literally stopped to say, \\"Wow, this is really gonna be good.\\" Howey has the ability to conveythe mood of a particular setting better than any author I've ever read. I became engaged with the first character of the book. I remembered that this was how Wool started for Howey. He published the first part online and didn't think anything would come of it. Well, surprise! People wanted more. Now I knew why. When I finished the first part, I couldn't imagine not having the rest of the book. I do remember thinking this though - there is no way I am going to let myself get attached to the next characters.<br /><br />What a stupid thought that was. Throughout the rest of the book, I found myself thinking like the characters and experiencing their emotions right along with them. Folks, some of you might not know how hard that is to do as an author. Trust me, it is. It had been a while since I had to actually put a book down and take a break because I was so overwhelmed with what had just happened. I did that a few times with this book.<br /><br />Wool was different. I guess we could call it science fiction, but I would call it human condition fiction. I know that sounds funny, but this really was a set of stories that let me consider how humans would react in this particular post-apocalyptic scenario. My background in political science had me wondering about how humans would naturally respond to what took place in Wool, and I think Howey was spot on. He understand us, and that is why he was able to create a book that can connect with us so powerfully.<br /><br />The writing was superb and the stories were captivating. Seriously, if you want to read a book that can help you get your creative mind going, or whether you just want to sit down and be taken away from where you are right now, pick up Wool by Hugh Howey. This is one of those book we'll want to read over and over. It's timeless. I put it on par with 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, etc. Great work!

0385349947|5.0|I am a 28 year old single mother of an 8 year old boy. I am a teacher, not a CEO. In fact, I work two jobs to keep our family above water. I do not want more children and I do not want to get married. Guess what?<br /><br />THIS BOOK HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. It doesn't matter if you are a Harvard grad, wealthy, poor, a grocery store clerk, a civics teacher, 20 or 50 - this book has invaluable information for you if you so wish to take it.<br /><br />I am in the middle of leaving teaching for something I believe to be more lucrative (marketing), and I am so glad I picked this up. (I got the Audible version and I recommend it.) I've already changed the way how I talk to potential bosses and my colleagues about myself. And she GETS IT - she gets the sexism, the struggle, the dirty dishes, the feeling that you need to \\"lean back\\" way too far in advance (which I did, getting stuck with a career I didn't want in the first place b/c I thought it was \\"respectable\\"), the embarrassment of having esteemed male professors steer you into the direction of something they feel is safer, etc.<br /><br />Only 3 of the 11 chapters deal with rearing families and working, but even in those chapters I found myself nodding my head in agreement. I also had to face my own prejudices I had about women (and I thought I was so forward-thinking).<br /><br />I honestly feel that critics of the book prejudged it so badly in advance they refuse to change their position or just plain didn't read it all. Sandberg advocates for women everywhere, but she makes a point that the high-profile women are in the best positions to advocate for the rest of us. And yet...she's insistent that we ALL have to step up and start raising our hands. SHE IS RIGHT. And she's right about the things that women to do hurt each other and ourselves, something most modern feminists don't want to say out loud.<br /><br />This book should be mandatory reading for high school students, male and female.<br /><br />To those ofyou who want to LEAN IN, I applaud you - and I meet you at the watercooler, I've got your back.

B0013HA838|5.0|In this 2008 Royal Opera House treatment of \\"Le Nozze di Figaro,\\" the beloved opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart that was written more than 200 years ago, Erwin Schrott plays Figaro, the title character.  The opera was based on a play of the same name by the Frenchman Pierre Beaumarchais, with a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte.  It was a tremendous hit for Mozart when it opened, despite, or perhaps, because of the fact that it was controversial and radical in its time:  It is titled for a servant, Figaro, and shows him outsmarting his master, the Count Almaviva.<br /><br />The plot seems intricate and complicated but is not.  It is the wedding day of Figaro and the delightful Susanna, two servants of the Count Almaviva. They are wary of the Count, who has abused his power and seduced many servant and peasant girls, and now has eyes for Susanna.  The count regrets having publicly given up his historic \\"droit de seigneur,\\" the right of the lord to have the first night of her marriage with a woman under his control, merely to impress his friends and servants with his enlightenment liberalism.  His Countess is suffering, too,  seeing her husband flirt with and charm innocent young women every day. She teams up with Susana, devising a series of plans to teach the Count a lesson: the Countess and Susanna switch their identities by exchanging outfits. The Count does not realize that the woman disguised as his wife is actually Susanna, and, for once, feels the unfamiliar twinge of jealousy as he sees her flirt with Figaro. Soon after, he sneaks off to what he believes is his rendezvous with Susanna, except the woman is actually his wife. Upon being confronted with his actions, he begs the countess's pardon.<br /><br />Susanna is played by the lively and lovely Miah Persson; Count Almaviva, by Gerald Finley, who has also played Figaro; the Countess, by Dorothea Roschmann; Cherubino, by Rinat Shaham. The opera was directed by David McVicar; the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, conducted by Antonio Pappano. The Royal Opera Chorus is also featured.  The flavorful sets and costumes are by Tanya McCallin.<br /><br />I recently saw this at a local movie house, in $25 seats, to celebrate my birthday, as I love this opera.  I had somehow forgotten (Oh, those senior citizen moments) that I was shortly going to see it live, presented by the Wilmington Concert Association, a local - Wilmington, North Carolina-- based organization. Though surely, not done by so grand a company. Anyway, at the end of the performance, I noticed a 2006 copyright date and had an OMG moment: I could probably find this for sale at Amazon.  And I could, and I did purchase it, and am delighted with my purchase.<br /><br />Mind you, I love music, most of us do, don't we all?  In my case, I treasure a fairly wide range of it, rockabilly, golden oldies, pop-Great American songbook-Broadway, jazz, classical, opera, some country.  Unfortunately, I haven't that much technical knowledge of music, nor the world's greatest ear. I have read the excellent, very informative reviews of this opera on this site, and am not qualified to produce anything remotely like them.  I can only say that I love this purchase: it is sheer joy to me.conducted by Antonio Pappano. The Royal Opera Chorus is also featured.

B00004YA66|5.0|Without going anywhere......this was the first movie that dealt with time travel on this kind of scale that I know of and trust me, it's a thrill ride from beginning to the climactic ending.<br />It would be shameful of me to give you the plot of this movie but I'll give you a somewhat condensed version......<br />Cop from Queens finds his late fathers ham radio in closet, plugs it in, turns it on during the aurora borealis and somehow gets in touch with his father 30 years in the past..and in his time, is also an aurora borealis....this is where the story gets interesting and where I stop explaining but believe me, it gets nothing but better from here...........and the story works very well right up to the climactic ending......This should not be missed.
B005GYGCOI|3.0|It was better having the guide than not having anything. The prices were a bit out of date as can be expected and some of the procedures like buying a ticket in the International Tourist office new Delhi Train station was a bit deferent.

B007V4530A|3.0|Great starting  but, like other kindle readers, even if  I started highlighting a lot of tips at the beginning, the highliting habit vanished gradually as the text went  on. At the end, the content feels forced to fit. Finally, the 'hows' are sintetized in one word: \\"practice\\".
0307341550|4.0|'Sharp Objects' is Gillian Flynn's first novel and a very good one at that. The story starts with the introduction to Camille, a reporter for a smaller Chicago newspaper. Camille is assigned a story back in her home town on Wind Gap, MO. Right from the start Camille is not happy about going back home and we start getting a little insight as to why.<br /><br />Enter Wind Gap. We find Wind Gap, Mo a small town with a cast of characters and secrets. Camille is looking into the murder of two local girls. One nine months ago and a second girl has disappeared. While in town, the body of the second girl is found and the hunt is on.<br /><br />It is hard, at times, to relate to flawed characters. At first I felt for Camille. She has returned to her home town from the big city. Running into old classmates and finding the same sad routines still happening as when she left. People seem to fall into the same ruts as their parents. In addition to former classmates, Camille must deal with her Mother and step father. Both of whom are very strange. As we meet these people and learn more of them we start to understand why Camille has the flaws and a rough past.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book, I had a little trouble with Camille's character. While she is flawed and has a very troubled past. The only issue I had was her slip with the character of John. I thought it pushed her flaws a little too far. Otherwise, this book is a very good read and with summer approaching get a copy for the beach.

1451683405|4.0|I enjoyed reading this little book, and although the idea has been around for a few thousand years in several spiritual systems, Harris has done a good job at explaining for the layperson this illusory concept in a unique manner.<br /><br />Most of the low-ratings reviews seem to have wanted a full philosophical work, or a full scientific work, or some other such mega-book. They somehow have missed the entire point of the author in keeping the ESSAY short, sweet and readable. Likewise, the price was under $10, again implying that it would not be a scholarly textbook or academic work.<br />It is a little amusing to read the angry 1 star ratings, most of which display a simple programmed bias for wanting to believe (without any proof whatsoever) in the \\"free-will\\" fairytale, and also show that the author didn't prove the negative (ie. prove there's no free-will!) inexhaustibly both philosophically and scientifically.. again missing the whole point of the short essay.

1439199388|3.0|The basic view in this book is quite simple: our environment is becoming clean far too quickly, and human immune system has nothing to fight with in this environment. Instead, autoimmune diseases develop at a far greater rate in recent decades.<br /><br />You might imagine this simple idea can be explained in a magazine article.<br /><br />No. As a book, the author meanders too much to prove this point. Many marginally relevant or borderline irrelevant materials related to human evolution have been  added to the book. On the other hand, real statistical evidence, especially as to the balance between the harm from germs and parasites and the \\"benefits\\" from them (having something for our immune system to attack) is few and far between.<br /><br />So this overly long book brings a valid conjecture, but without coming up with a reasonable answer.
0525478817|3.0|Three stars, despite the fact that John Green is probably the best YA author that ever lived. The Fault in Our Stars involves kids with cancer, so in the author's defense, it is near to impossible to write a 'kids with cancer' story without an overdose of sentimentality that borders on the sicky-sweet. Such is the case here with our two cancer-victim teens who fall in love. About the only thing you're left with is who is going to pass away first? Flip a coin. The characters were a tad too adult for hormonal teenagers, the story line a tad too predictable. Perhaps I'm being too harsh, but I finished the book and then redeemed Mr. Green by re-reading Looking for Alaska, on of the best YA books ever written, in my opinion.  Your mileage may vary, of course, and given the number of 5 star reviews for this book, I fully admit I am in the minority.  Oh well, there's a butt for every saddle, right?  This saddle just didn't fit mine.  ;)
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Found this book by accident, but have found it very enjoyable and an easy read. I would definitely recommend it.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I was alive during most of these administrations - yet never understood how great some of these Presidents were (or are)!  Glad to see Hoover was such a force in recovery for WWII.  Reinforced my feelings about Carter.  Book shows the great ego that is required to handle this position, but also enlightened me the difficulties these men faced every day.  The best Presidents are shown to have the office of President be the most important aspect.<br /><br />The book made me believe that these elected officials truly do love this country.<br />One of the best books I have read in a long time!
B00BF11STU|1.0|It was interesting content but long and boring. I felt that the movie was too much about the main girl and not about the mission they had.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I first played Minecraft at my cousins house last Saturday night (Xbox 360 version) and immediately fell in love with it. I was already thinking about getting the pocket edition since I had heard so much good things about it and half of the people in my class had started a newsletter called Minecraft Weekly. So the next day I downloaded the game and it isn't quite as good as the Xbox 360 version but it is very good. Recommend it to everyone!

030758836X|2.0|How well do you know your spouse? That is the central question behind Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl (as well as the stuff of many forensic TV shows).<br /><br />Set against the terrifying backdrop of a wife's sudden and suspicious disappearance, the first third of the novel is a tightly woven Whodunit? which follows married couple Nick and Amy as their relationship disintegrates prior to the disappearance. It is well-written, interesting, and believable. The second third sustains interest as suspicions mount and the story becomes a WhatReallyHappened? thriller, although the story line takes some increasingly bizarre and incredible turns. It is the finale of the book where everything unravels: the final chapters devolve into a convoluted mess.<br /><br />There are several real-life instances of a spouse who is totally oblivious to the psychotic nature of their mate (The Boston Strangler, for example), but Gone Girl assumes that the world can be deceived and that smart and capable people will agree to live in fear, opting for a chance to \\"finally\\" make amends for their life with a child of their very own (ugh) rather than expose and contain a monster. Flynn assumes that readers will believe that a weak and only slightly neurotic co-dependency will outweigh sanity. Ridiculous.
B007SGM084|4.0|I really enjoyed the storyline, however the sexual encounters were a little more often than I felt necessary, and I quite enjoy reading sexually explicit stories. Overall I did love reading the book and do recommend it.
193413712X|5.0|I loved this book. It's not linear, it's not a traditional narrative, and it was simply great. This book is like opening a little treasure chest only to find wonderful, strange, amazing little surprises in unexpected corners. Highly recommend. Excellently observed, and very well crafted!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have no complaints about this product other than the fact that your ears get warm after some time.  The frequency response is top notch and I am more than satisfied with it.  I use it in a home studio setting.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Best thermal paste I've used. Spreads VERY easily and smoothly. Also easy to remove if needed. Doesn't get &#34;sticky&#34; and clump up on my cpu like the other pastes I've used. When I was changing out my heat sink months later, the paste spreadable and had not clumped in weird places whatsoever. It's great. Love this stuff.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Okay, I resisted Downton for three seasons, thinking it would be too 'PBS&#34; for me.  Then a friend put it on while I was there and i was hooked.  Already devoured season 3 and can't understand why they don't make more episodes faster.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Running on a Toshiba Thrive.  Great graphics, responsive touch controls, no lag and, it's free!  There's certainly less fun ways to waste time.  Only gripe, due to distance between and relatively sparse coins in each cluster, player must rerun the same section of track with little possible progress before collecting enough coins for any meaningful upgrades can be purchased.  Unless, player is willing to spend real money to buy coins.  This of course, is exactly what the publisher is counting on.
B001G70M6S|4.0|This worked perfectly for the old Polaroid camera that we have. I live in a large metropolitan area and film like this is rare to find.
B004IPPINW|5.0|Hamid's prose is impeccable. One of the fascinating things about this book is that it's entirely a monologue and that the English is so formal but never stilted and never awkward. I felt something unpleasant gnawing at me throughout the entire book, but I didn't know what it was until the last line (I won't say anything about that because it would ruin an incredibly good mystery novel). I appreciate Hamid's sense of decorum and his ability to tell a riveting story without having to rely on gratuitous sex and violence or a wild and often distasteful imagination such as is found in most John Irving novels. I like Hamid as much as I like Yann Martel (&#34;The Life of Pi&#34;) and Neil Gaiman (&#34;Coraline&#34;, &#34;American Gods&#34;, and &#34;Anansi Boys&#34;) my two favorite contemporary novelists. The protagonist's description of his financial sector job, his Princeton education, and his Pakistani perspective of American society and politics are fascinating and enlightening. I want to read more of Hamid's work.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Very stable with enough adjustments to fit almost any work station. I have many of these in my office and highly recommend it.
B0084AYLK8|4.0|I enjoy reading 19th c. literature, but the prose style is likely too &#34;convoluted&#34; for most modern readers.  Add to that the fact that Hardy is preserving a distinct south-England dialect AND that he has a penchant for using obscure words and even coining his own words and one faces more than a few linguistic challenges.  As in most Hardy novels, the plot hinges on a series of improbable &#34;coincidences&#34; in the interfacing of characters and provides an unusual &#34;rags to riches&#34; and back to rags again saga of a man who appears unprincipled on the surface but whose eventual dedication to principle proves very costly to him.
B0046B4VXQ|4.0|I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick and tired of everyone talking about being bullied.  Everyone on the planet has been bullied -- minus maybe the top alpha dog I suppose, since who would bully him? -- and so I might say, \\"Get over it already!\\"<br /><br />But that being said, if anyone DOES have a right to complain about bullying, well, it would be Carrie.  To the students at Palisades High School (I guess the location of filming for the school scenes), bullying was a bloodsport.  It was to the death.  They wouldn't be happy until there was blood in the streets, and I guess they ultimately got their wish.<br /><br />Naturally, this segues into themes about blood.  Blood is more than symbolic in this film, a film that sometimes goes over-the-top in its religious imagery.  I did get a good chuckle out of one scene, a laugh that was surely not intended:  let's just say that somebody gets crucified at one point to a wall with a bunch of knives.  Well, at least the director stuck to the extended metaphor throughout the film.<br /><br />But back to the blood.  This is the first time that I've seen this film completely unedited, and that changed it a lot, actually for the better.  The opening scene is somewhat shocking, and the first thing that I thought about was:  OK.  Chloe Moretz is in the remake that's releasing later this year.  Now, she's a really nice up-and-coming actress -- check out \\"Kick A--\\" if you disagree with me -- but she's under 18 so the sequel will surely have to be different.  I don't know how they'll get around that scene, personally.  It actually begs the question:  should a remake even have been attempted?<br /><br />One other minor theme here:  \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\\"  I am a fairly big fan of Amy Irving, and she gives a very nice performance here.  But she makes a sacrifice in this film that I'm not convinced a high school student would generally be mature enough to make, but it is a plot device to get Carrie tothe prom.  But Ms. Irving tries to do something nice for someone else, and let's just say it backfires.<br /><br />Well, with regards to talking about bullying, I'm pretty bored by it all, to tell you the truth.  But I surely wasn't bored by this film, and I don't think you will be either.  A pretty big recommendation by me for a true horror classic.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This is a classic hollywood stunt.  Take a funny story and lace it with so much gross and degrading sex talk, and you end up with a disturbing, mediocre movie.  Not a family movie.
006074748X|5.0|I don't think I've ever been disappointed by a novel written by Mary Stewart, and Airs Above the Ground is no exception. It's written beautifully and coherently, with the odd light touch of humour.<br /><br />I've always loved her strong, descriptive writing, and although these days her style may seem a little dated, I actually find that I turn to her novels precisely because of the way she writes.<br /><br />This is my third time of reading this, and the storyline, the writing, and the characters are all as fresh as that first time. Highly recommended for lovers of timeless fiction.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Great music. Amazing guitar playing (blues and blues-rock) and takes on some standard blues tunes. Musical guests added some wonderful diversity.

I was able to create software to read joystick style controls, then send out iCade keyboard sequences to an iPad. The standard Arduinos do not have USB &#34;host&#34; support, so their USB port is only a serial port. The Leonardo can be toggled in software so the USB port can appear as a keyboard to the PC/Mac.<br /><br />Note -- this uses a different USB connector than the UNO. My desk is a mess of cables now that I need three types of USB adapters to go to my UNO, Leonardo and Teensy 2.0. Ah, standards.

Now what remains of the legion must fight its way back to Roman lines, they lose their commander and virtually all their number but a handful one of them a Centurion who learned the language of the Britains who he and his men meet up with an exiled woman from the britains tribe. Soon only the Centurion returns to Roman lines only to learn that he's been marked for death by his own commanders because they don't want it coming back the Roman's can be beaten. A good film, but needs work historically to say the least.

B005ZO6NRA|5.0|Conan of Simmeria was born in combat, his mother dying in combat's blood was his very first taste. His father raised him, and in a way Conan made himself a warrior of the tribe. Until one day a warlord and his sorcerress daughter come for the peice of a mask that was shattered to ensure its evil would no longer plague humanity. Conan loses his father and embarces on a search for the two, and for each of their compatriots he slays he gets closer to avenging himself and his people. Conan meets with a beautiful preistess named Tamara who is the last of an ancient blood line that's needed to activate the mask, the two fall in love and she tries to save him by sacrificing herself. Conan then makes a daring raid into the warlord's castle intent on finding Tamara and destroying the mask once and for all. A good retake on the Conan series.

B009JZTOG8|3.0|Season Two was a bit harder to follow.  There's so much back story that they try to go and explain and pull from the other world that it makes it very difficult to follow.  I actually didn't end up watching all of this season because I found it so difficult to follow.  At one part they try to explain how the Giant of Jack the bean stalk was hurt.  And they seem to pull a wild card saying oh that was my twin brother. He must have done this.  It just seemed so easy to pull that card out of your back pocket and and say oh I know who we can blame it on this person.

B00136NT4O|4.0|A slickly produced album.  My favorite songs are not the &#34;hits&#34;, though.  Snakebite, Dangerous Tonight, Die For You and Wind-up Toy are all epic songs.  There is a good mix of 80s pop and metal on this record.  So much more here than Hey Stoopid and Feed My Frankenstein.  Highly recommended.
B0080CL0HM|4.0|Set in Europe during the 1890's &#34;Bel Ami&#34; is a basic story of one man's rise to wealth. I love the fact that Pattinson is stretching out as an actor and taking on characters who have more faucets to them. It took me till the end of the movie to actually understand the whole depth of the story, but the last few scenes of the movie gave way to the European ideal of what marriage must have been like during the late 19th century. What I loved the most about this movie is that Pattinson's character embodied the reasons why most women married during that decade, the only difference, was the character's gender. Although, you traverse from loving to hating the character's decisions, the understanding behind them is always paramount. Although not one of the greatest films ever made, I would own it in a heart beat based on Pattinson's performance and the history behind the movies birth.

B00BF123WG|5.0|I expected it just to be about when the team went in and killed Osama Bin Laden. It was more about the years of information gathering before they went in. I found it interesting to see that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I looked forward each week to seeing how the writers would progress the story line at the prison.  You could see each of the survivors at the prison grow and change in different ways.  I enjoy the tension the show creates through the living and the dead.  I hope Season 4 keeps the upward momentum.
0316113514|5.0|I purchased this book because of some great feedback that I heard from a fitness friend.  I work at a youth home where we try to keep the kids super active and &#34;in shape&#34;.  This book makes great sense and I have actually seen the benefits of its implementation in our program.  Easy reader (for me, but I love anything that convinces me that being active is beneficial).  Highly recommended for everyone! Families, schools, employers, employees, ....anyone!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We love the whole thing.  All the Hobbit movies are the best of entertainment!  The price was right as well, which is always a great selling point.
B008D36INE|2.0|Truly. Rachel Weisz shines in character-driven films, and though Tom Hiddleston is a relative newcomer to US audiences, there's no doubting his talent at all. I adore character films and getting into the heads of people, really observing the mechanics behind a given period of time, and WWII (pre-, during, and post-)is still so near to pretty much everyone in the Northern Hemisphere that we can find these stories pretty easy to relate to.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />I thoroughly agree that the presentation was jarring in the beginning, combined with massively overdramatic, though lovely, music. I believe in music as a character that guides us in films and tv that bothers to put in the effort. It was the beginning of the affair, but the music was already gearing for a tragedy while Hester and Fred were just meeting, which was a flashback that occurred after the film opened with her attempting suicide. Cool. You know the ending, and hey. Lots of movies pull that off through the characters. but they are stagnant. The emotions are beautifully portrayed. They're just portrayed several times with no change. No growth, no development. The script and the world in which they lived was just not enough to set up the story they wanted to tell. I needed to know why she loved him so fervently. Why did her husband not give up on her? We're flat-out told these things by the characters, but I just didn't believe it. I didn't believe in her mental frailty, I was told about it and it was expected to be enough. No. The only believable thing I heard was when she said something about Fred not living in the present, how he was stuck in 1940. That resonated and gave the most insight into who any of the characters were.<br /><br />I dunno. I didn't expect anything going into this film except that she would likely die or be ostracized in some capacity, but how can you expect anything else with the name Hester? Come on, now, that one was obvious. Even so, not expecting anything was expecting too much. It just felt hollow and dead, and selfish. There are far better tragic movies out there where the cast is used to their full capacity and the film is assembled with passion and care.

B009RH9FR6|5.0|I don't think that I could think of anything to make this product more useable. The case doesn't interfere with the screen. The rotation locks in place so it doesn't move until I want it to. You can even fit a pan style stilus in the fold.

B004UID2LC|4.0|I know converting YouTube videos to MP3 music files isn't the only function of this app, but to me it's the most useful. I'm more likely to want to listen to music than watch videos when I'm not in a position to stream content.

If you have been fighting other models or trying to find driver software, this is the unit for you.  At this price you can't justify fighting your current adapter.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Young London lawyer Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to conduct business with Count Dracula, a mysterious and very sinister-looking man who reveals himself only at night. When their business is finished, Dracula seems intent on keeping Harker in Transvlvania while he travels to England. Harker soon figures out Dracula is not just an ordinary man but a vampire and manages to escape only to suffer a mental breakdown, delaying his marriage to Mina, a woman Dracula becomes fixated on. To the rescue comes Van Helsing, a doctor who knows about vampires and how to kill them. But their efforts to find Dracula are hampered by the fact that Dracula has Mina under his power and is able to stay at least one step ahead of them as he flees back to Transylvania.<br /><br />This classic is written in an interesting style with the plot relayed through diary and journal entries of the people surrounding Van Helsing. Readers might find it interesting that Stoker based Dracula on Vlad the Impaler, a Romanian ruler during the mid 15th century known for his cruel impalements of men, women and children. The plot lags at times, especially during lengthy discourses by Van Helsing, but it's an interesting look into the period (late 19th century) and the mindsets and interactions of men and women of that time. The story is at times thrilling and suspenseful and Dracula a most evil character.
157815121X|5.0|I enjoyed this reading by Judi Dench. She puts a lot of character into the voices without overdoing it. Recommended.

B00355L2TU|4.0|This workout is difficult enough if, like me, you are just getting back into shape.  You can also make it a little easier or harder per Jillian's instructions. I like the short intervals of different activities--I don't get bored--and the multitasking.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is very fun. It is very addicting.I recommend you to play this game.In this game you have to dodge obstacles to get away from the fat guy (no offense). I hope you enjoy this review like I do. I also hope this review is helpful.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|This book is thrilling with twists non short of wow. I recently started reading the maze runner series and I thought the maze runner amazing,the scorch trials has a twist at every page in the book,some for the good and some for the worst,and the death cure very surprising, at the end of the book I was at the verge of tears. I can't wait to read the next book and will be sad that the series will be over
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I think this game is better than Angry Birds because you can be more creative in this game. You get to build cars,and sometimes airplanes! You can build it any way you want to and it is a lot of fun! I recommend this app!

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this version of Angry Birds because there are no ads. Every other version is solo annoying when you have to ex-out the ads! The Angry Birds Rio also has different birds that were not on the other games. This game also has different power-ups than other Angry Birds games. I recommend this game for anyone!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A milestone movie, one of the best.  Fantastic!  Deserves all of the awards it got.  Highly recommended, get the blueray version.
0393327345|5.0|As utterly hypnotic as it is viscerally brutal. Definitely worth a read for those craving a narrative richly pulsing with deft subversion.
B007EZJKS2|5.0|The artwork is spectacular vivid, whimsical, and ethereal. Reminiscent of the animated movie but it certainly had a flair and style of its own.Such as Mama Fortuana's midnight carnival had a touch of the mesmerizing nightmarish quality and the grandmother's story of the unicorn as a child showed the right amount of nostalgia with overwhelming joy and awe that can't quite be taken in or expressed without it being cheesy.<br /><br />The story is just wonderful the narration blends so naturally with the images and the dialogue. there was more of the story in the comic than the movie I loved the spider crying to me that really was unique of having freedom shatter the wonderful illusions of grandeur we make for ourselves. and<br /><br />All in all. Good work, good art, good story.
B0099PCUIC|3.0|The sound quality has much to be desired. The headband use to be a metal strip but is now plastic material. I guesss you get what you pay for. Next time I am buying a better quality headset.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am so hooked on this game!<br />My only complaints are (still) that you can never explore more than 5 or 6 rooms in a row (out of energy). You do spend a lot of time going back and forth to the same rooms for the same items; but as the game progresses the items you find vary a lot & help you complete various quests. I still think the amount of diamonds you can earn through the game is abysmally low while the coins I earn in the game are out of proportion (after you open all the rooms there are not a lot of things you need the in game coins for). I wish there was a way to spend game coin on diamonds. Amazing graphics and a lot of areas to explore. I am up to level 60 & I have not made any purchases (other than replacing about $20.00 worth of diamonds my kid bought/used/spent without asking & without realizing how hard they were to acquire through the game - that was a lesson in learning how to use the parental controls on your device :o) no more \\"whoops\\" charges to the bank card!)
B005K17RU0|5.0|For a free app this one is a keeper.  I keep it in my carousel and refer to it hourly. It's really good.

0812993845|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE! Make sure your schedule is clear for about 12 hours. You won't want to put down the latest classic Sophie Kinsella!<br /><br />Talk about laughing out loud!

Here she is 30, and single.<br /><br />Told from 2 different people, Lottie and her sister Fliss, this story is so cute and so much fun, I don't think you can escape from it easily. Fliss just wants the best for her sister.<br /><br />So when Lottie and her old boyfriend Ben, decide to go through on the pact that they made that if they were both 20 and not married, they would get married. Fliss will not stop to make sure they don't consummate the marriage! She believes it is one huge mistake.<br /><br />But is it? Find out when you pick this book up!

055338466X|1.0|This is probably among the silliest books I've read. It's silly on two accounts. It's silly in the frivolous sense. It's a poorly thought out screed against god-based religion and \\"philosophy.\\" I guess the authors thought that they were purging the world of superstition and sectarian violence. I just keep thinking about the introduction to Elaine Pagels' Beyond Belief - the part where she gets in out of the cold into a church after a run to ease her anxieties over her small son who was about to get a death sentence from a team of physicians. Not only would the child die, he would die painfully. Pagels found the church a place she could weep and grieve without exposing her anguish to those closest to her - the people that needed strength and reassurance, not more grief. Also, she found people with whom she could share her experience and still hold a basic faith - one \\"beyond belief.\\" The faith was this: that there was something positive in this world, something that transcended suffering, something \\"eternal\\" and valuable. Is that the demonic force that the Grand Design authors want to exorcise?<br /><br />Sure, religion is a human thing and it's full of problems. But it is a lot of things. It's not just the belief in some mystic godhead. Sure, some people feel that way. Not everyone. That's not how religion has evolved. In many cases (like reconstructionist Judaism, to name just one) \\"God\\" is not a requisite for religious thinking at all. But yes, the \\"definition\\" of religious thought is a systemization of logical processes in light of uncertainty and applying this process to analyzing the human condition. In that sense, it is \\"transcendent\\" thought. It is an attitude, a searching for underlying meaning and value. Everybody does it - atheists, pantheists, physicists, the whole bleeding lot.<br /><br />Is religion really the cause of even a significant amount of the group violence we see in the world? You might think so if you take a very shallow view of history and assume the pogroms, the inquisition and the holocaust were the result of religious thought. But it seems to me that anytime we establish differences among people - race, ethnic background, and political or moral opinion - the stage is set for violent outcomes. Should we all be the same? Should we all dye our skins mauve and become libertarians? Hitler gassed the gypsies along with Jews. Was this a religious statement? Is \\"jihad\\" really a religious issue, rather than an expression of the social and economic structure of many regions of the Middle East? Were the race riots of the `60s religious in nature? I think religion more often than not serves as a space for discussing and possibly averting violence.<br /><br />The second source of silliness in the book is its internal logic. First of all, if philosophy is sterile and non-generative, than so is physics. After all, for many years physics was known as \\"natural philosophy.\\" Philosophy is the study of the underlying principles and approaches of a field. Hopefully, physics is a field containing basic principles that can be scrutinized and improved on. Unfortunately, you wouldn't think that was happening if you read this book.<br /><br />Its main physics point seems to be to debunk the idea of an \\"origin\\" to the universe. Apparently, a lot of people think that the \\"big bang\\" signifies a point of creation. And a point of creation means a creator. Heresy! The authors of this book can't tolerate that. So they've come up with a host of new physics telling us we exist on closed sheets embedded in a hyper dimensional space whose world lines bend back on themselves (a la G&ouml;del.) We're simply skating over a kind of sphere with no clear origin or endpoint. And literally a bazillion universes are possible - all existing simultaneously, obeying different physical laws. As there is no beginning or end to this process, the issue of conservation of energy and mass in a big bang doesn't have to be discussed. All the stuff was there all along. You don't even have to evoke \\"fluctuations\\" or swapping space-time for mass. Don't you feel better already? Don't you feel you have the key to understanding how the universe works?<br /><br />All of this is very imaginative (like religion), but all of this appears with little proof. Yes, we have the Higgs in hand. But has anyone traveled to or seen definite evidence of another \\"multiverse,\\" especially, one closed on itself? I wouldn't know how to begin to assign a truth-value to the huge number of interdependent assertions made in the text relating to the nature of reality. But remember the definition of religious thought. So what the authors have done, essentially, is to create a new \\"mythology\\" for the new (religious) cult of physics. What an improvement over the old religions with all that superstitious stuff!re all along. You don't even have to evoke \\"fluctuations\\" or swapping space-time for mass. Don't you feel better already? Don't you feel you have the key to understanding how the universe works?<br /><br />All of this is very imaginative (like religion), but all of this appears with little proof.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|As an IT employee, I read this book as a free read from Amazon, not realizing that I would connect so well and in so many ways.<br /><br />From the beginning, the story serves as a nice piece between elements, but the hard decisions and emotions felt are the same that any IT employee has felt regardless of position. The desire to make life better and functions easier is at the core of the profession, but sometimes the core becomes the thing that makes everything the antithesis of what you are trying to achieve.<br /><br />Diving in with an objective, but open mind, I gained a new appreciation for all levels of IT. That is truly remarkable. I would highly recommend this book to anyone directly or indirectly involved with IT (aka everyone).
0812993845|5.0|I think I have read every book that Ms. Kinsella has written and \\"Wedding Night\\" is one of the best.  It isn't by any stretch of the imagination something that you would expect to have happen in real life (how many sisters would go these kind of lengths to help out their little sis) but it is really fun thinking \\"what if?\\"  I found myself laughing out loud exclaiming, \\"no, no, no\\" more than once.  I think the best analogy would be the old madcap romantic comedies from the fifties and sixties - I also love those movies, too.<br /><br />I recommend the book and pretty much everything that Sophie Kinsella has written.  I have favorites, of course, but they are all good!

0316776963|5.0|I didn't know anything about David Sedaris before I read this and I'll admit I was REALLY skeptical for the first third of the book. While the way he presents things is really hilarious, the subject matter was a little too bizarre for me to appreciate. But after I'd gotten used to it, I really started enjoying this book. And after I finished it and was thinking about it, I began to appreciate how at the beginning, as he's talking about his childhood he does have a more immature and childish manner in the way he tells the stories... it's as if the books and writing matures with him. Funny read.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Read the book. Loved it. Love the first season, too. Follows the book well - does a good job glossing over details without departing from the key characters' core traits. Nice job!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|So....never have actually reviewed a movie on here. Always meant to, never got around to it. But I rewatched the newest film version of Les Miserables this weekend, and I can't quite contain myself. I should probably stick my disclaimers here......No, I have yet to read the actual book. It's sitting on my shelf, just waiting for me to devote three months to it. Maybe this summer, we'll see. No, I haven't seen this performed on Broadway. I really want to, but the opportunity hasn't presented itself. So there may be some of you out there disappointed because one of your favorite bits from the stage production got cut out, but I wouldn't know the difference. Sorry. Anyway, I thought it was stellar. I could only find one or two things to complain about, honestly.<br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar with the story, it is set in post-Revolutionary France. We are introduced to Jean Valjean, a man serving a 19-year sentence on a hard-labor work gang for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving nephew. When his sentence is finally up, he is released but told that he must carry his identification papers at all times--they mark him a criminal, and he must report in on a regular basis or be faced with violating his parole and immediate arrest. Unfortunately for Valjean, nobody will hire him because of his criminal record. He is faced with starvation until a Bishop takes pity on him and brings him into his church, feeds him, and gives him a place to sleep for the night. Hardened by nineteen years on the work gang and facing a merciless world of starvation, Valjean awakens early and absconds with the church's silver. He doesn't get far before a group of soldiers catch him and return him to the church, where the Bishop tells them that he in fact gave Valjean the silver as a gift--no crime has been commited. After they are gone, he tells Valjean that he has redeemed him for God and expects him to use the silver to become an honest man. Valjean then has to face what he has become and decide how he will proceed with his life in light of this undeserved and unlooked-for grace that he has been shown. But according to Javert, guard of Valjean's workgang and later an Inspector for the French police, this kind of redemption is impossible. Once a criminal, always a criminal. And once Valjean decides to break parole and start a new life, Javert will stop at nothing to bring him to justice. (This is maybe the first twenty minutes--I'm barely scratching the surface here.) The resulting tale unfolds against the backdrop of the poverty and political unrest of France in the early 1800s and is an unforgetable and moving portrait of the redemptive power of grace.<br /><br />This story has been adapted multiple times, whether it be film, radio or abridged versions of the novel. I'm usually a staunch opponent of abridgement, but in this case I can understand. I'll read the real book, thank you very much, but I can understand the desire to simplify this behemoth of a novel. This particular film is itself adapted from the 1980 Broadway stage production by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg, and so is nearly operatic in form--all but about ten lines of the film are sung, and those ten mark places where the script has been cut down to trim the four-hour stage show to the film's runtime of two and a half hours. Personally, I think there are a few more places where they could have simply spoken, as it sounds a little disjointed (I suspect that these spots mark other, less drastic cuts, but I could be wrong as I have never seen the stage version) but on the whole the result is powerful and incredibly well-acted. The words are so powerful that I reccomend watching with the subtitles enabled, just to ensure you don't miss anything.<br /><br />Kudos to Tom Hooper for being able to bring this to the screen--I'm sure it was no easy task! Also kudos to Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg for their excellent stage show and their work in helping with thefilm. I'll just go ahead and give a blanket congratulations to all the people working behind the scenes. But for me, the cast of the film is what blew me away.....<br />-Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean: Dissing Hugh Jackman is a favorite passtime for some people, but I just don't understand this. Sure, I'm an inveterate comic book geek and loved his turn as Wolverine in the X-Men films (Okay, so X3 and Wolverine Origins sucked, but that had nothing to do with him and everything to do with the writing), but he was simply outstanding in this. Did you know he could sing? Not only that, but he can act at the same time! Some have criticized his performance here, citing a couple places where his voice breaks or he does something un-singerly like sob in the middle of a song....Again, I don't get this. I think these moments only add to the performance! His character is having an existential crisis! His character is falling apart, and you can tell! I'll take the sobs and vocal quirks over a perfectly enunciated performance any day.<br />-Russel Crowe as Inspector Javert: The brunt of criticism for this movie, so far as I can see, was directed at Russel Crowe's performance as the film's antagonist. Again, I don't get it. He's maybe a little weak in his first number, but it's kind of an awkward bit to sing. All of his other numbers, especially Stars and his last song (to give you the title would be a spoiler) are excellently rendered. He brings enormous gravitas to his role as the Inspector who feels himself honor-bound to bring down Valjean.<br />-Anne Hatheway as Fantine: Going into the theatre and looking at the poster, I idly wondered why Anne Hatheway rated equal billing with the film's other top stars--sure, she's excellent, but I knew the story and how little screen time she would get. Let me say this right now: I was right about the screen time. But--BUT!--I was ever so wrong about her deserving top billing. Ms. Hatheway absolutely steals the show with her performance asFantine, a poor woman forced into prostitution to feed her daughter, and if there is a dry eye in the house at the end of her song I Dreamed A Dream you are truly heartless.<br />-Amanda Seyfried as Cosette: The character of Cosette isn't really that complicated, but Ms. Seyfried puts in a very solid performance. The romance subplot feels very sudden and underdeveloped, but that is not in any way the fault of Seyfried or Eddie Redmayne, who plays Marius. I suspect it has more to do with material being cut for the film version. At any rate, she sells her character, and her musical numbers were surprisingly good.<br />-Isabelle Allen as Young Cosette: The young Ms. Allen is absolutely adorable, and somehow manages to look identical to the woodcut of her character that has served as the iconic image for the show for nearly thirty years. (See the poster above) She doesn't get much screen time, but she does an excellent job with what she's given.<br />-Eddie Redmayne as Marius Pontmercy: Mr. Redmayne's character, Marius, is a young Parisian student and one of the leaders among the revolutionaries when he sees Cosette across a crowded marketplace and is smitten. (I did mention that the romance was a bit sudden.....) Now Marius must decide whether to join his fellows in their bid to overthrow the King, risking his life and future when he finally has something to live for. Mr. Redmayne's performance is excellent, and when he sings his song Empty Chairs At Empty Tables near the end I challenge you once more to find a dry eye.<br />-Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers: These two serve as the only real \\"villains\\" of the film, but they also serve as the much-needed comic relief. Throughout the film, these two are delightfully greedy and nefarious. The film would be much less fun without them.<br />-Samantha Barks as Eponine: Yet another show-stealing actor/actress in a minor role. Eponine is the daughter of the villainous Thenardiers and friend of Marius, who she secretly loves and who keeps sending her on errands to help him woo Cosette. Her rain-drenched performance of the song On My Own is yet another heart-wrencher.<br />-Aaron Tveit as Enroljas: Enroljas is the leader of the revolutionaries and a friend of Marius. A very solid performance.<br />-Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche: Huttlestone gives a rousing performance as the youngest of the revolutionaries, a young Parisian street urchin.<br /><br />Powerful as it is, this is not a film for kids. It is rated PG-13 for suggestive and sexual material, violence and thematic elements.<br />Sexual content: For the most part, this is Fantine's subplot. Driven from her factory job when it is discovered that she has an illegitimate daughter, Fantine finds herself forced into prostitution in order to keep sending money to the Thenardiers for her daughter's care. There are numerous prostitutes in evidence, and the accompanying song, Lovely Ladies is ridden with innuendo. And yet to remove or censor any of this would be to remove the heart of the film. There are some other innuendos evident in the Thenardiers' song Master Of The House, and while a couple of those could theoretically be removed the sequence serves as much-needed comic relief. On the whole, it isn't very explicit and I would certainly not avoid seeing it on account of this.<br />Language: Mild language, nearly always necessary to get the point across.<br />Violence: There is a battle between the revolutionaries and the soldiers, and people die. On the whole it isn't very gory, but a couple of the deaths are emotionally weighted.

0714843377|5.0|This book offers a lot of great ideas with only a few words, and because it offers only a few words regarding an idea Paul Arden had, it gives you much space to think. Like the one about winning awards. I see the piont that awards focus on the past successes, not much about the future. Probably, we should think everyday is a new start and work from that point on.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|This is a great buy at this price ($70?)... Although, when people say that it is grainy... There are only about 5 scenes in the first episode that are grainy (the first 3-8 minutes maybe?). I think they did something weird with the cameras when filming those because other than that... This has been PERFECT! Some of the special features aren't that high definition but that's expecting a lot for a show that's still going on.... The only other thing I noticed was that I had my TV settings changed at first which made the graininess of the first episode stand out more but once I changed it back to a better (warmer, less bright) color setting, it made those first 8 minutes a lot less noticeable. Now, the rest of the episodes look perfect! Trust me when I say, don't judge these blu-ray's on the fact that the first scene is grainy because that is something in the show... Not this set. The set is perfect and WELL worth the buy (especially at this price!)!!!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|This case seemed like a great concept when I purchased it.  It's sorta bulky though. It made using my phone more difficult though. I found it harder to text and people usually had trouble understanding me over the phone. Also I had a car charger (not made by apple) that I couldn't use without removing the case.<br />All in all I wasn't too disappointed in the case until the latch that seals in the port at the base of the phone broke after about 3 months. Since the case is no longer really waterproof I've switched back to my otterbox and vowed to be more careful with my phone.<br /><br />If you're considering buying a waterproof case either consider another one or buy directly from lifeproof and get the extended warranty.

1476734941|4.0|In a nutshell, this diet promotes eating normally five days a week and semi-fasting the other two in order to lose weight and be healthier.  The authors claim that limiting oneself to two small meals totaling 500 calories for women and 600 for men on the fasting days reduces high blood sugar, the risk for cancer and cardiovascular disease, and other health risks.<br /><br />According to this book, the body benefits in several ways by doing a semi-fast, including giving the pancreas a rest so that it can manage insulin more effectively and the body is able to use up the extra stores of glucose and fat.  When insulin isn't used up it is stored as fat and specifically the dangerous \\"belly\\" fat.  The book offers a more scientific explanation of this but that's the basic process.  The specific decreased risks of cancer, heart disease, and other health issues are also covered.  Dr. Mosley wrote this book based on his own success with the diet and seeing his health numbers (insulin, cholesterol, etc.) improve dramatically as a result.  Of course, those with diagnosed health issues like diabetes should consult with their doctor before fasting.<br /><br />Fasting is often difficult because we don't like the discomfort that can come with it.  In other words, we don't want to feel hungry.  However, with two small low-carb meals on those days, it is doable and the fasting days aren't done consecutively so on the days in between one can eat normally and the foods they desire (although the authors do encourage healthy eating over splurging on junk food or overeating).  The fasting day menu includes small amounts of lean protein sources plus lots of vegetables which can make the meal more substantial than what the calorie count suggests.<br /><br />Different than long-term fasting or a cleansing fast, this seems like a common sense approach that can be planned according to one's lifestyle and social schedule.  The book includes several breakfast and dinner menus with photos of themeals.  A suggested maintenance plan is also covered for those who have reached their weight loss and health goals.<br /><br />I tried this diet for a week and it wasn't as uncomfortable as I anticipated.  The mid-afternoon discomfort was the most challenging but came more from my habit of sometimes mindless snacking during my low-energy time of day than actual \\"I'll kill for chocolate\\" hunger.  I drank some of my favorite herbal tea and distracted myself with a hobby and that got me through it.  I actually did the 600 calorie plan recommended for men instead of 500 calories for women, but even so my glucose numbers did go down and I lost a little over one pound.<br /><br />The only negatives for me were that much of the suggested food measurements are in grams instead of ounces/cups/tablespoons and the book claims \\"quick and effortless\\" weight loss but I don't think any diet can promise that for every person.  I go into this knowing there is no magic that effortlessly melts away the pounds, but commiting to a reasonable, healthy plan will eventually deliver the desired result and this has the potential to be that.<br /><br />Overall I think this plan can be beneficial to most people and the concept is one I will continue to try, perhaps with some modifications, with the hopes it will help reverse my pre-diabetic conditon as I lose weight.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.

B00BJS7LHC|1.0|buyer beware<br /><br />This is &#34;HD&#34; in name only. It looks much worse than a DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie in theaters and wanted to watch it again without having to go out and purchase a DVD. I purchased this product expecting a Blu-Ray level of quality and was sorely disappointed. Also, I hope you like the amazon Unbox player, because thanks to DRM it is completely unwatchable otherwise.<br /><br />Come On Amazon, you can do better than this.

1451696191|5.0|As an English Lit. major, I'm hesitant when a modern author is praised as good as a classic, in this case Chbosky's book in comparison to A Separate Peace or Catcher In The Rye, but the reveiws and hype are well deserved, it reads like Catcher, but also has the melancholic, introverted voice and descriptive observations given in Separate Peace. Its still not high literature, but its definitely worth the day or less that it takes to read it
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very interesting, although a lot of it went right over my head. I think there are a lot of parts that he could have skipped (medical stuff) that the average person wouldn't be interested in, but overall, great info.

B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I'm sorry I spent the $$ on this video.<br /><br />The pros: costumes and settings/scenery. Truly gorgeous.<br /><br />The cons: reallly bad acting by the leading lady, lack of a cohesive story/plot (if you didn't read the book, don't bother with this version of the movie), and someone took way too much creative license (they tried to be clever by visually tying the story to a theater production, but the effect is very distracting and muddled, and they rewrote parts of the book, while leaving out entire chunks that are key to understanding the story).
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I LOVE BRUNO MARS!! This CD is sooo good, you have  a mixture of sounds and beats! Its AWESOME and FUN TO SING WITH!!
B00012QM8G|5.0|I admit that this isn't the kind of movie that I enjoy watching over and over again. It's just too intense. However, I believe it's an important film to have in one's collection, especially to share with younger family members as they mature.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This game is fun. Like how easy this is and you don't have to spend money to play.  Hope everyone enjoys.

B004WR125O|5.0|Having an receive without WiFi connectivity? Once you get used to control your receiver with your smart phone over WiFi, you will never go back. This is easy to set up if you have a last firmware of your Onkyo receiver and is almost invisible. I can't imagine not having it...
1600597963|5.0|I'm a beginner in a beadwork so I like this book a lot. It contains description of materials, techniques, projects to start with & tips how to develop further. I found examples & galleries inside very inspiring. This book is my favourite among 4 I have at the moment.
0451232852|1.0|Returned book for refund. Not a prude but I enjoy true historical fiction, not soft porn ( not even good enough to be called a romance novel). First hour of reading was filled with descriptive passages of deflowering virgins in detail, etc. Read it if you like that sort of thing but don't think this a real historical novel.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Loved the DVD. Not as good as in person -- the next best thing! I would recommend this DVD to anyone. I also believe that this Opera should be a MUST for everyone/every person. Alfie Boe is nothing short of spectacular -- such a voice, such dramatization!! This is not to say that the other performers were not as good -- they worked and performed stunningly well. BRAVO!! BRAVO!! BRAVO!!
B00BSBY38A|2.0|Just wasn't that impressed, it was kind of dull & boring and towards the end when it was just him and the tiger I lost interest
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|My girlfriend really didn't like the gratuitous nude scene at the beginning, but this really is a good story.  It get's a little out there at times but it get's reeled back in.  I would certainly watch it again.  Another good Denzel flick.
B008D36INE|1.0|This was about the most boring movie I could watch, the plot was horrible, the story was horrible, I definitely did not like this movie
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I don't like having to keep pushing keys on a keyboard to adjust my audio volume (I use headphones to listen to a lot of music videos), so I've been buying keyboards with a rotary volume control on them, but now my current keyboard is getting worn-out. I went looking for another one like the one I have and they don't make it anymore, in fact, almost nobody makes one now days. The ones I did find I didn't like at all for various reasons, so I went looking for a separate controller and found this item at a reasonable cost and thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did, this was easy install and works great, plus now the blue LED gives me a constant indication of my volume level, where before I had to move the keyboard volume control to see where the level was set to. Now one of my problems has been solved: I can buy any keyboard I like, with the features I like and I don't have to worry about what kind of multimedia controls it has. Highly recommended!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie!  There were a lot of tense moments.  Great acting.  I enjoyed it immensely.  I love Ben Affleck movies.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Depicting \\"real life\\" stories on the screen is always diffiicult, and this one clearly presented special challenges -- an intensely personal human journey, a controversial therapeutic discipline that isn't well understood by the public, and sexual issues that could have been badly mishandled. Thanks to poised, intelligent performances by John Hawkes and Helen Hunt, the potential pitfalls were not only overcome but transcended. Excellent supporting cast -- especially the always-remarkable William Macy, as a Catholic priest who makes a leap of faith and counsels Mark O'Brien before and during his \\"sessions\\" with sexual surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Green.
B00A1C16HS|5.0|A good series. I enjoyed every minute of it. I will watch again. A great example of British TV series.

B008220C38|1.0|This has to be down there with one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was difficult to follow the story line. I had such great expectations of it originally. I generally love period movies. Very disappointing.
0307352153|4.0|Disclosure: When I signed up to read Quiet, it was because I wanted to learn more about the differences between extroversion and introversion so I could be a better business owner and work with my employees better. I also wanted to be able to write characters in books better. It is with these to things in mind that I read the book and I write this review.<br /><br />Quiet is an interesting book in the topic, but it is nothing so new as to be completely stunning to me. Anyone that has taken a psychology or personality test knows that there are introverts and extroverts. We practically grew up with the terms through our youth. At least here in western cultures. And that is precisely the point that Cain makes with Quiet.<br /><br />The first 2/3 of the book is really about what introversion is, how people that are considered introverted and quiet are different from extroverts fundamentally and in personality, and what makes us introverted genetically and culturally. Cain does a wonderful job of laying all three of these points throughout the third, then expounding upon them for the second third of the book. You'd think this could drag on and get boring, but it really doesn't. Instead of writing this in a dry academic tone, Cain writes in a popular science sort of way, but her own quiet confidence shows through. I suppose in parts one could find it boring, as I did not find it necessary to constantly run to pick up the book every second I had free. It is a smooth read, thoughtfully laid out, and with a LOT of well researched information.<br /><br />The last 1/3 of the book was more of a self-help feeling. I can say I wasn't impressed by this part, but that does not mean it wasn't bad, nor was it helpful. It just seemed like common sense to me. When you read it, and surely you will, you'll see that Cain goes through one chapter about how to comes to terms with and work with the introversion in adult people. These are focused around interpersonal relationships as well asin the work place, so it's quite useful for those that are not as intuitive to both sides of the introversion-extroversion argument. Another chapter is devoted entirely to the raising of and working with introverted children. I found this section much more helpful as Cain brought up the school system, and I just happen to be an educator. She points out that children are just miniature adults, and should be treated and worked with accordingly, perhaps with a lot more care for the most sensitive of the bunch.<br /><br />Despite of me feeling that this stuff was obvious, I also realise it is very necessary to state many of these things. It is a very good book for people that would like to know more about the whys and hows of introversion, how to step into or out of your own introversion or extroversion to the other side, and how to work with people that are introverted or extroverted. Not only does this book has a lot of applicable use to it as a psychology book, it really celebrates those quiet, reflective introverted moments of everyone's life.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given this book to review by WaterBook Multnomah Press. I am under no obligation to give a good review, just an honest one.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Characters should cost a lot less. Plus mystery box should appear more. When collecting coins they should be in bulk. Item in the store should cost a lot less.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I hadn't heard much about this Bond movie and I was pleasantly surprised.  Quantum of Solace picks up<br />where Casino Royale left off.  We have yet another great performance by Daniel Craig and Judi Dench as &#34;M&#34;,<br />a good flowing story that keeps one's attention and more scenes of wonderfully filmed action.<br />This is the perfect Bond movie to own along with Casino Royale.  Buy them both now... you won't be disappointed....<br />I wasn't.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|It had a few moments, but overall a very disjointed move I would not recommend.  Thumbs down on this one.

B009AJDDQU|3.0|I guess all the reviews for this movie led me to expect something ponderous and impenetrable, like 2001. But instead I found it's just simply a SF monster movie with a long slow start before the mayhem begins; more like 2001 reinterpreted by the Brothers Strause. Which is not necessarily such a bad thing. Like virtually all SF movies the plot was written by idiots who apparently never read or write real SF or anything comprehensible for that matter and never seem to peer-review story logic, so don't expect it to make a whole lot of sense. It has really cool Iceland helicopter shots, familiar and non-familiar aliens, and the usual great actors hired to stand there and emote and make sock-puppet dialog sound profound and convincing. When it's over you should almost be able to explain it someone else.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I did not like the wife or the husband and really had negative feelings re the characters....they got together for all the wrong reasons.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I love this movie and I recommend it to all of my friends and family members.  Of course, everyone wants to borrow my copy.  (smile)  The Blu-Ray features really make this DVD come to life.  I see (Ha Ha) something new every time I view it.

I would gladly pay for the sequel(s).

I read this  book with an excitement to see what the author had experienced...He sets up the book with a thorough review of his credentials, experience and life.  He then covers what he experienced over the course of a week when his brain was &#34;dead&#34;.  My looming concerns began to build as I read along.  He goes into detail about the &#34;core&#34;, the &#34;orbs&#34;, the &#34;earthworm view&#34; and refers to God as &#34;om&#34;.  The book was NEW AGE.  He never refers to Jesus himself, he never refers to hell, he never refers to the Bible, he refers to evil a couple times.  His overall approach is that everyone is going where he went (which we dont really know where he goes as it doesnt line up with the Heaven described in the Bible).  He does refer to God as unconditional love and a true warmth is felt.  Yet, as he nears the end of the book, after such a life altering experience, he decides to point the importance of consciousness, NDE, out of body experiences, esp, clairvoyance, etc as the place to focus your attention.  He has an organization dedicated to learning more about this phenomenoa.  He says the ultimate realization is the conscious and increasing our awareness of it.  What a total letdown!!!  I believe the point he was exposed to...he just about missed completely.  The focus?  God!  The creator of the universe and the one who knows how many hairs on our head, who knew us before we were born in our mothers womb, who sings over us....What a disappointment. I do honor who he is and wish him well...but I think his book leads folks into themselves and doesnt lead people to an experience of the all powerful, all knowing, all encompassing God who is THE POINT.  This book is new age and left me feeling flat.  I know some won't agree, which is ok.  I just want the existing Christians to know IN ADVANCE...this won't ring true with your Christian beliefs.  It doesn't point to God.o God.

0061950726|5.0|Hundreds of thousands of children were taken from the east coast to rural areas around the time of the Great Depression. Apparently the Children's Aid Society organized these trains as a money-making enterprise: people would pay to get a child who would help with work around the house, farm or factory.<br /><br />Vivian, now 91, tells her story to Molly, a 17-year-old girl whose background resembles her own. The two are brought together when Molly gets sentenced to 50 hours of \\"community service\\" for stealing a book; her friend persuades Vivian to work with her for a \\"school project.\\"<br /><br />The stories run parallel. Molly has bounced around foster homes just as Vivian did, but Molly's moves are carefully supervised. What social workers miss is the undercurrent of hostility that Molly feels; it's obvious that her current foster mom wants money, not a child to love.<br /><br />Vivian, much earlier, also bounced around. In those days people weren't required to report suspsected abuse as they are now. Yet the book shows that abuse can be relative: Molly has learned to hold back her feelings and she's never been a child.<br /><br />I found the story hard to put down and I don't think we need more detail. For one thing, the Orphan Train experience would have been a blur of scenery to the children. We don't learn much about Molly because her present is so overwhelming.<br /><br />I hadn't read anything by Kline and was pleasantly surprised. The writing and pacing are well suited to the narrative. I liked the additional touches of information about orphan trains - a historical phenomenon that wsw to me.<br /><br />Excellent, thoughtful book that will probably be chosen by book clubs as well as readers seeking fast-paced but intelligent fiction.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Enjoyed playing the game. Good graphics, fun adventure. Easily find hidden objects without to much eye strain. looking for another along the same style.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Rise of the Guardians is the best animated film ever. Uno de los mejores films animados de todos los tiempos.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun. I really just want the free jems that's why I'm writing this. but yeah its a pretty fun game so far.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I think this would be one of the most collectible albums of all time. The tunes are great, and the lyrics are just incomparable - and that includes The Beatles, The Doors, and all the top groups. They are poignant pure poetry with rebellious wisdom. I wonder how much we missed, as he had to quit the music scene early, because of lack of success in this country! What a loss for the people!
B0026KX4HS|3.0|Thought the kids would love this, but they didn't really enjoy it that much.  I liked it enough to rent it.  But that's about it.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This Cd is the bomb for 7 dollars! I would recommend it to anyone. It arrived on time and the package was complete.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I've always enjoyed mysteries, and movies of Sherlock Holmes. I'm enjoying the easy reading style of these stories. Great read!
B000009HF2|5.0|This was my favorite album when I was younger.  I hadn't heard it in years, but love it just the same now.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I love this album. I can say this, it's like poetry, we'll all experience it differently. Delve in and take the ride and let your musical spirit fly high. I'm highly anticipating their next release, hopeful not much longer. 2013.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am so hooked on this show. It is very well written. My father was born in 1912 so it gives me an idea as to what was going on then. I will continue to watch.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love Bingo Blitz. It's a lot of fun. I love that we can add team mates and we get a daily bonus. Plus friends can you send you free gifts and you can send free gifts. The only thing that I do not liek about this app is it freezes up and you lose your credits and your possibly bingos, and treasure chest. Other than that it is perfect
030758836X|5.0|Its a great read so far.  I'm excited to ready Gillian Flynn's other novels once I have completed this one.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a fun game. I have found myself playing it for hours., lots of things to do on it. Very entertaining.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|Love this book!!! Super quick read. I couldn't put it down. Well-written. Romantic and sweet with some mystery thrown in. If you are looking for a good clean book this is a good one. Can't wait to read book two.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was very apprehensive about reading this book. I was afraid of the violence.  However, I took a chance because the rest of the book's description was calling to me.  As with all great books, I spent a few nights reading until the sun peeked through my window. Not good on a work day!  I fell in love with the story and the characters. I read page after page without realizing I was holding my breath until finally I exhaled.  If you love a page turner, a great love story, and a story about overcoming adversity this is for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome free game for kids 12 and under. Sounds boring but it is a VERY fast paced game. Is in the temple run family for sure<br />!

B002BWP49C|5.0|the disc works great no scratches so thank you compared to redbox rentals its works well so thank you again
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Why didn't I realize that this DVD was a musical? I don't recall seeing &#34;MUSICAL&#34; in caps on the front of the package--Anyway, I loaded the disc, watched the opening with men hip deep in water singing their hearts out--What do they eat for breakfast? ran thru my mind. Next, Russell Crowe sings to Hugh Jackson--Oh, no! Actually, I am a fan of Russell Crowe the actor, but not the singer. That is when it dawned on me that I purchased a musical rendition of one of the greatest stories ever written by the greatest French writer.<br /><br />I hit stop, unloaded the dvd, and put it back in its package. I am sure that &#34;musical&#34; is in small print somewhere--<br /><br />I gave this dvd a 5star because the picture had 8 academy award nominations and 3 golden globe awards.Therefore, it is probably very good. But I swear on the name of Victor Hugo that I will never watch this dvd--this musical--this travisty
B00BHU261S|4.0|Nice movie. All roles were played well and make for an enjoyable evening at home with some popcorn, but I don't think it will be an all-time classic.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|For an excellent review, please read Matthew Dickerson's &#34;The Hobbit-Part 2-<br /><br />For my part, I think that Martin Freeman is a very good Bilbo Baggins.<br /><br /> Some of the scenes are so exaggerated that I lose my interest in the film. Soo unlike Tolkin, but soo like Jackson.<br /><br />It is a good flick, but slides away from Tolkien's  premise. He wrote fantasy, but not war,war, war.<br /><br />However, enjoy the film, but don't read Tolkien's  The Hobbitt before you enjoy the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Allows us to watch over & over!! we are Viewing in non-high def. Thank you for offering! Plan to view All!

B00846F1YW|4.0|Enjoyable game. Lots of variety in the puzzle types too.  I`m  40+ and play this to relax. I like that I don't have to post to Twitter or Facebook. Well done game and interface.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|excellent-- arrived undamaged and in perfect shape---thank you so much<br />A fan of yours from the beginning. You write beautiful songs<br />Lorraine Walsh
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Hearing about a NDE from a scientist who did NOT believe in them was inspirational.  More proof that there is so much more to life and \\"death\\" than just this earthly realm.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It was a good decision to select this book.  Being a country boy, I could relate to the story.  My wife even liked the book.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|This is the second or third time I've read Mr. Connelly's second Harry Bosch adventure. the Black Ice contains essential early character development forHarty and is the first &#34;lone coyote&#34; book in the series. Our hero goes to Mexicomin search of justice for amurderedcopmamd the book breathes thick with the dust of Mexicali and the sweat and blood of the bullring. ¡Viva Harry Bosch!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|not a real american idol fan but i watched that one season and i loved this song and how soulfully phillip sang it. even my 4-year-old loves it and wants to play it over and over again in the car.
B002AOWXQ8|2.0|No doubt \\"Home\\" is a very catchy and genre stretching song.  But having said that and after listening to the whole LP, it fizzles out.  Be very mindful of the hype this is receiving.<br />  I am sure some people out there give this a raving review because of what they represent, a return to honest, roots inspired hanging out in the park, lazy drug induced mellow music.  But it is rather depressing and lack luster.  Even the cover is a throw back to the 75 Rolling Thunder Dylanesque troubador marching band.<br />  It seems that they are trying to create something that simply cannot be created. And, in doing so, have released a mind numbing, intelligence insulting CD/LP.<br />  I personally find this a painful listen. Unless you are a new age flake, who is trying to grasp on to anything that even remotely represents your \\"Earth Flower\\" sentiments.  This is a dud.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Good movie, plus you have to love all of the extras that this comes with. Would definitely recommend this movie.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|GRRM is a god among writers. I grew up with a strong distaste for reading, instead preferring the easy entertainment of video games and TV. After discovering the Game of Thrones TV show on HBO i decided to thumb through one of the books. A few short months later i found i had ready every book in the series. If this book can make me like reading for fun i'm sure it will be an instant hot for anyone. The BEST book series ever written!

B005L38QHA|3.0|I have had this mouse for about 5 months. I had received it as a birthday gift. It was fine at first, but it seems that now since I have had it for a little bit. It wants to cut in an out. I play wow quite a bit. I raid as well, so when I go to move the mouse every once in a while. It likes to just stop working. An I have to move it frantically to get it to move correctly.

B003H4I4JU|5.0|A boy is reading a book in school .sounds simple, right? Think again. It was early spring of 2013, and I had just finished the book just mentioned : Enders Game. Deciding that I  would like the next book, I decided to get the sequel. And what a magnificent choice that was! The sequel, SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD, is set 3000 years after the first novel, and introduces the reader to a exotic and interesting world far from the dystopia of Battle School, full of fluctuating characters, shocking plot turns, a delicious story, and a new race of extraterrestrials that challenge the races penned by individuals such as George Lucas and James Cameron. For any reader who is a deeply philosophical person, or just a science-fiction buff such as myself (I'm both), this is a very enjoyable story.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|This is a gripping, comical, and detailed work. You can definitely see GRRM style in this and i enjoyed every minute.
B008220D5K|5.0|I can honestly say that I'm glad all these bad reviews didn't deter me from renting this movie. This movie had my boyfriend and I laughing the entire time! So much better than what we expected from watching the previews alone. Let it be known that we are both 21 year olds, so age and problems of relating with the movie characters wasn't a factor. It wasn't depressing, just expressed the hardships of life through a comedic outlet. I say give it a try and just be your own judge of this.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|If you are a fan of the series or the books this is a must have collection. All of the pieces are of high quality and i even display the box. The show itself is by far one of the best on TV and this set makes sure you can watch it whenever and however you might like. It has blue-ray, DVD, and Digital copy. So purchase and enjoy EVERYWHERE.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus is a free, easy-to-use, easy-to-install app. The buttons are large and easy to read. I use this app on a daily basis and it's a big help.

B000FCKIFU|5.0|This is one of the best adventures in fiction I've read in  awhile. It's a look into what could happen in this the 21st century. Let is all be aware.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I really like this game. Graphics are great and it keeps your interest BUT all the real $ buy ins are The most costly of any game I have so far by far.
1455502626|5.0|Book was excellent. Kept you guessing. Liked the way it explains the area.<br />Had one problem the book was a missprint. The pages in the two hundred seriers (about 40 pages  repeated later in the book. Leaving out 40 pages in the 300 series. The book was so good that I kept reading it.
0988262592|4.0|The Phoenix Project was helpful.  I started rethinking how my shop operates and started working on a kanban board as soon as I finished it.  I think a short reference would benefit many.  Something with the meat of the book minus the narrative.  I'd bet the key concepts in the book could be summarized in a few blog posts.  Would like to have that on the author's website or at the end of the book.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|Entrepreneurs and start-up owners NEED to read this book. It's a review, ten years later, of the classic &#34;Four Steps to Epiphany&#34; book, by Steve Blank. More than a review, it is a &#34;reshape&#34;, including all the experience of teaching and coaching that the authors have developed in the last ten years.<br />For investors, it's a new way to look to new businesses. Instead of asking for old-fashioned business plans that no one will read, investors should start to ask for Business Model Canvas and the hypothesis that supports the new endeavors they are willing to fund.<br />Superb!
B00BTHV05M|4.0|It's one republics sound all the way.  A couple of tracks are really awesome and I'm about to wear out my MP3 player but at the same time it's nothing super new.  I wish I could remember the name of the tracks but a couple really stand out as far as being creative.  If you're a fan you won't be disappointed though.  And I would definitely recommend it.
0689835604|3.0|Karen Katz, Where's Baby's Belly Button? (Simon and Schuster, 2000)<br /><br />A lift-the-flaps book Karen Katz-style, with her distinctive illustrations and simple text. It's a lovely book, but it's getting a slightly lower review than I'd otherwise give it because it's not as well-constructed as it would be reasonable to expect given that much of the flap-lifting is going to be done by the pre-lit set; the flap on the back page, especially, is likely to start coming loose after just weeks of handling (it covers almost the entire page) . Still, that shouldn't dissuade you from getting a copy (though you may want to pick it up from the library first to give it a test). ***
B009G8GRX6|5.0|If you're a MUSE fan you should be happy still.  If you're new to MUSE you will probably become a MUSE fan.  Very strong album although it wasn't what I really expected but like all good bands and musicians these guys have evolved into something really great.  I hope to hear many more albums to come as long as they keep putting out this caliber music.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book.  Everything about it!!  The characters were loveable or disgusting depending which one you're talking about.  The town the book was set in sounds adorable and I could just picture those precious kids.  Loved it!!
B000T00PE2|5.0|I bought this ages ago and to this day I still listen to it like it's the first time.  I actually heard the song &#34;Angel&#34; in place that I shouldn't have been and it was kind of ironic that I like it so much.  It was a really dark song but very beautiful at the same time.  The rest of the album turned out to be just as awesome and I would definitely recommend it to any Massive Attack fan.  If you're not a Massive Attack fan try it cause you might like it.  It's pretty cool.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The product subway surf is fun and engages the person playing. It interesting and you don't want to go off it.:-)
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|I guess because of the song &#34;I will wait&#34; and liking it so much I was expecting more.  However it was a really good album over all.  After giving it a few listens it turned out to be awesome and very well written.  I'm definitely thinking in the long run &#34;Mumford and Sons&#34; is going to be around for quite awhile.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great game. needs more goals though ;)<br />good to hand eye coordination. kids love it. husband and I love it
B00BEFL5Q8|5.0|&#34;Bloodsports&#34; reclaims Suede's greatness.  Don't expect &#34;Dog Man Star&#34; II.  &#34;Bloodsports&#34; stands out on its own merit and overshadows pretty much all of Brett Anderson's output since the mid-90s.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Even though this title kept poping up on my recommended reading list,  I ignored it for about 6 months - I think just based on the title alone.  Once I caved in, I downloaded the Wool Omnibus Edition since it seemed like such a deal.  I loved the series so much I downloaded the &#34;Shift Omnibus Edition&#34; which was both a prequel and a parallel view of what was happening in the initial Wool Series.  I really like the way the author used this technique to tell the story.  I would advise against reading the Shift series before the Wool series - I don't think it would work.  Note that I read both of these series on by Droid phone while traveling in Costa Rica.  I believe the Wool/Shift series can be enjoyed by a much broader audience than SIFI/Fantasy fans.<br /><br />I would also highly recommend the author's other series &#34;The Bern Saga&#34; if your preference is more toward the non-fantasy type of SIFI.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I really couldn't get into this book.  It is extremely boring.  Was really disapointed.  Wouldn't recommend it at all.  Do you think I should keep reading doesn't it get better?
1608862771|5.0|It is amazing how much you can enjoy \\"reading\\" in a book with hardly any words.<br /><br />Mattias has so much sense of humour!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This one jumped right into the story again, without making it confusing. It picked right up and felt like I had to start all over setting the pace.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was freaky! I am not sure that I liked the ending? But can't imagine another way to end it-  a good read. Can't wait for our book club to hear what the others think.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm addicted. I was reluctant to watch this show. My daughter said oh, come on what it with me. Now I'm so obsessed I can't wait from week to week.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Looked forward to a Season 2 hoping that it would rival the 1st season, but &#34;2&#34;  far surpassed the 1st season. Probably because I now knew the characters and was invested in the story lines. I was not surprised of course, as this is an excellent show. Looking forward to Season 3. No spoilers, please!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It wasn't what I was expecting actually. There was a lot of hype of crazy weird sex, but I was pleasantly surprised with a actual story line around the sex. Some plots were a little predictable, but overall I loved it!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is a very basic and boring game. The only thing that I like is the fact that you can sell off your prizes to get more coins to keep playing. Would be a great game for preschoolers.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I would definitely not recommend this J. Grisham book to anyone. I have been a fan of his books for years and this is not up to his usual caliber.  It's as if someone else wrote it ( someone who doesn't have anything constructive to say).  There is no redeeming social value to the protagonist's actions and if this is what I am to expect from future Grisham novels, then I won't be reading them.  K. Schoenhals
B005COO1X6|4.0|I can't get over how Steven King can come up with new stories. He has bean writing for so long. I still always enjoy reading what he writes and have for many years.
B0090SI42Y|3.0|Mindless kungfu action but enjoyable even though more the Shaw Bros film genre of the 1970s. Just pure entertainment ok

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I love the movie and hope there as many sequels as there are books. Burroughs is amazing; the movie was pretty faithful to the book: A Princess Of Mars.
B00003CXFV|5.0|this movie is about a rel life average mom who kicks some serious butt fighting for the safety of the residents of hinkley, california. like it says on the cover artwork, erin brockovich brought a small town to its feet and a huge company to its knees...not knees in my eyes. in my eyes she made them fall and land on their butts! erin brockovich is both a role model and inspiration to me! hey, world! women kick butt, too! especially mothers! ms. brockovich, if you are or ever do read this happy mother's day!
B004WE01YA|5.0|By far my favorite Disney Classic. I could watch this movie over and over. Great for the family and some quality time.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie more than met my expectations!  Wonderful story, beautiful cinematography and fine actors.  I highly recommend it<br />for watching as a family.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|nice to be able to watch the theatrically released version online. a must watch for TOS fans. or trek fans in general.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Since the 1960s, when in college, I have been a Beatle fan. I have a number of Paul's albums after the Beatles broke up and when this came out I wanted it because I was not the typical Paul McCartney music and very enjoyable.
B00005JMJG|5.0|How many bad relationships have you had? Relationships that keep you from moving forward for one reason or another? What if someone offered you a simple solution that would only take one evening and cost a nominal fee? Would you take it?<br /><br />  When we first meet Joel Barish (played by Jim Carrey), he's waking up in his home, wearing pajamas he doesn't recognize. It's Valentine's Day and, rather than go to work, he makes a spur of the moment decision to visit Montauk. As is typically the case with beach communities in the off-season, Montauk is deserted. Then, unexpectedly, Joel sees a woman on the beach. He wonders why he \\"falls in love with every woman\\" he sees who shows him \\"the slightest bit of attention\\". He encounters the same woman when he orders breakfast at a local restaurant and then, one final time, on the train home. The woman (played by Kate Winslet) introduces herself without any prompting. Her name is Clementine and she and Joel are getting off at the same stop. Their initial interaction makes Joel rather uncomfortable, he being the quiet, reserved type while Clementine is very outgoing and gives little thought to other peoples' opinions of her. Additionally, she has great disdain for generic adjectives like \\"nice\\", a word Joel uses more than once during their time on the train. When Joel spots Clementine walking home he offers to give her a ride and she accepts. When they arrive at her apartment, Clementine invites Joel up to her place for a drink and, despite the differences between them, or maybe as a result of them, Joel is intrigued. They take a late night trip to see the frozen Charles River and their romance progresses. The following morning, they arrive at Clementine's once again, Joel driving while Clementine slept, and she asks if they can go to his place and sleep there. She enters her apartment to retrieve some personal items and Joel, waiting in the car, is approached by a stranger who inquires as to why Joel is there. The conversation is awkward and short. Then, Clementine returns and they depart. Next, the credits begin rolling and we are shown an obviously distraught Joel. That is when the story really begins.<br /><br />  I go back and forth on the subject of non-linear storytelling. There are some stories that seek to make themselves seem interesting by showing the elements out of order and others that are genuinely enhanced by jumping from one point in time to another. I believe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind falls in the second category. The creative manner by which they depict those elements of the story that take place within the mind of the main character, the subplots involving the unprincipled technicians performing the procedure add a whole new dimension to an already engrossing tale. Carrey and Winslet are both at the top of their games and, in my opinion, Carrey was never better before and hasn't been since. This is an amazing movie. See it.ion is awkward and short.

B003ITRZK8|5.0|The Godfathers of Death-Metal! Saw these guys in Oakland in the late 80's and it was Brutal! Expect an adrenaline boost with this.
0792846443|5.0|Really great movie that's good for its age<br />I used to own Misery but lost it; had to have another copy!

B007GCY8FS|1.0|My favorite series used to be Reacher.  By extension, one of my favorite authors was Lee Child.  Waiting for him to release a new Reacher book was extremely hard to do.  I can't believe that he worte this book.  I have never been so bored in my life.  If I am really very busy, it will take me 3-4 days to read a Reacher book.  I have been reading this one for two months.....I can only read this one for about 15 minutes until I can't take it any more and I put it aside.  I so want to admit defeat and just not finish this one; but, I refuse to do so.  I read voraciously and there are only 2 books which I started and could not finish.  I am determined to finish this book.  I don't know what happened to Mr. Child.  I am so disappointed.  First we have Tom Cruise starring in the Reacher movie - what a joke and what a slap in the face to those of us who are devoted fans!  Then we have this terrible piece of writing.  Hopefully, the next (and all to come) will be back on track.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania does it again all in one CD.  Love to hear her especially when on the road as trip seems a lot shorter hearing her great songs....  Just love it.....
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app worked at first but it wouldn't load the newsfeed... or anything else on my kindle fire and now I can't even uninstall it wtf?! I'm irritated by it and quite cranky. This is very low grade and awful quality
1612680011|5.0|This book is an excellent read.  It will teach you concepts of the way to think about money.  It teaches you that the people in different categories think about money differently.  It shows you the government treats the groups differently too.  If you are looking for a get rich quick or a book that is going to tell you how to get rich - this is not it.  If you are looking for a book that shows you how to understand concepts and a different way of thinking about money, it's purpose and the benefits it can provide, then read the book.  You will either &#34;get what he is saying&#34; or not.  It has changed my life in so many ways and I am glad to have wandered upon it.  I have read most of his material and there is a bunch of overlap.  This one is the best along with Cash Flow Quadrant and The Midas Touch.
B006UG90RM|5.0|You like the Van Halen from the 70's? Well you're in the right place because they're back! Yes, that same style that characterized them in the 70's! I like very much this album. Thanks to the band!.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Love love love Game of Thrones.  I just wish the purchase of the show on HD streaming wasn't so expensive... even on sale price!  Also wish I could have just rented the season for a period of time... as it's less likely we'll watch it over and over.
B001992NW4|5.0|PERFECT FILM, AND I THINK THE FIRST VERSION IS ENOUGH. I SINCELLY HOLD THE VIEW THAT ONLY THE DIRECTOR'S CUT NEED TO BE TAKEN TO BLURAY FORMAT, WELL, LEAVE THE ORIGINAL CUT TO BABIES, IF THEY DON'T WAT TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a great series --- the characters are the real draw, even moreso than the story line, which is also great fun and really interesting.  I also got Season 3 and am eagerly awaiting the realease of Season 4!
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|DON'T GET IT. WHY NOT USE CASAVO WHITE BLURAY BOX? IT'S SO STRANGE. HOWEVER, THIS EDITION SHOWS NO SPECIAL ELEMENTS TO OTHER EDITIONS. BUY IT...WITH CRITERION LOGO.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I couldn't put any of them down.  I had no idea when I started the series that is was related to the film.  I have not seen the movie yet but the books are a must read.
B0024HH32A|5.0|ALTMAN'S CLASSIC STILL ARE UNDERESTIMATED TODAY. HOWEVER, TIME WILL HOW GREAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. GREAT BLURAY EDITION FOR A MASTERWORK LIKE THIS.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|You should get this game. Even though it costs money . The game is incredibly good. Just get the game I love it and you would love it too. So get the game
B004EVNPGW|5.0|I WOULD LIKE TO BUY IT WITH MORE CONFIDENCE IF THE PACKAGE CONTAINS VINYL LP, BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE ME FEEL THE SENSE OF A GREAT RECORD LIKE THIS IN A KIND OF MATERIAL ESPECIALLY BELONGED TO THAT GOLDEN TIME.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|So far so good.  Will charge my galaxy nexus about 4 times in AC mode - 1850mah (probably 1500mah x 4) = 6000 which is 71% of the total which means I am loosing about 29-31% in the conversion which is as advertised.  Will not charge a samsung galaxy 10.1 tab - however, not much will without special circuitry.  Will charge a nook tablet in AC mode as well.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|THIS ANNIVERSARY EDITION IS SPLENDID, AND LUGOSI'S PERFORMANCE STANDS THE TEST OF TIME. UNIVERSAL'S LATEST DVD EDITION SHOWS NO WEAKNESS EVEN COMPARED TO BLURAY.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|I love this show. I rated it four stars because my very last disc/episode was scratched and skipping. Other than that I enjoyed it. Oh and yeah I bought it new. No complaints other than that.
B001EL6EH2|4.0|WHY NOT JUST PUT THE THIRD DISC IN BLURAY? I DON'T GET IT. CASABLANCA IS NOW DESERVING A FULL-BLURAY TREAT. WARNER, YOU'RE REALLY LAZY THIS TIME.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|cord that replaces the one that came with the fire, much higher quality than the one with the kindle, thanks amazon.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|i recommend this movie for everyone!!!! . . . The best 3d that i seen until today!!!!. . . i can't wait for the other two!!!!
B001CC7PP8|4.0|LEGACY EDITION IS NOT THAT PERFECT, BECAUSE THE IMAGE QUALITY AIN'T RAISED TO A HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL. IF YOU WANT THAT, GO FOR THE BLURAY, AND FOR A MAN WHO LOVES THE SYNOPSIS AND TRULY A FAN FOR HITCHCOCK, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Look- it's an amazing collection of Bob Marley songs.  That should be enough so you know whether to buy it or not ;-)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever. I give a five star for a good reason. Get it now cause it's awesome and great.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Look- just understand that this is a Hollywood movie and not a documentary.  I've read Tony Mendez's books so I feel like I know enough about what actually happened.  This was a fun, interesting, and exciting movie somewhat based on a true story.  Just enjoy it!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|great game, but the updates for the kindle fire take forever. New cloud levels have been out for weeks, but still waiting for amazon to update, I am so tired of waiting especially since I paid for this!
B00BN2CY7G|3.0|I'm a big time-long time Bon Jovi fan, but this just isn't a favorite.  Maybe it will grow on me over repeated listening, but I'm not optimistic.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|I could go on and on about this film, but two words totally wreck it: Kristen Stewart.  Wooden, dull as dishwater and everything else that everybody else has already said about the Twilight series.  This movie was overly long, underdeveloped, and utterly predictable.  I get the idea this was supposed to be a dark and twisted version, but what I saw was dark, and dismal and totally boring, badly acted and terribly scripted.  The dwarves were annoying...and why did they not go by the typical names...you know...Sleepy, Dopey and all?
B005GFPZYK|2.0|The book was poorly written with too little detail of events and actions. There are much better accounts of this conflict .
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you stick with this, you will see results.  If you live in an apartment with someone's apartment below yours, please keep in mind that this workout involves jumping jacks and plan accordingly.
1595825045|5.0|This book is an absolute must for any Avatar fan. Understanding how much work was put into this masterpiece of a show gives an even greater appreciation for it. The detailed research and trial concepts lead to brilliant designs that truly captured the artists' main goal. Each page captures the raw essence of the show and gives clear thought towards aspects we normally do not acknowledge. The book is absolutely fantastic and a great inspiration, especially to a fellow artist.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Great courage and sence of surviving! Amazing journey! the fact that he imagine all of that to protect himself was pure inteligence.
0767811070|5.0|Everything came as descibed. GREAT movie, it was a day late from the shipment date, but it was totally worth it.
0061537969|5.0|What an enjoyable book. I read it mainly because my son is a time trial race car driver and teaches other drivers and my daughter-in-law is not only a dog groomer but they both love dogs. It taught me so much about dogs, racing and most of all about life even at my advance age. I enjoyed the book so much that I reread it and bought it as a gift for other members of my family to enjoy and keep in their libraries. I believe even our teen-aged grandsons will enjoy reading it. Highly recommended. It will bring you to tears in some parts, but laughter in others. Enjoy it's worth your time in spades!
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|A slow story with a quick ending. I liked the Irish accents throughout the book and the descriptions of the surroundings, but the story was slow
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put it down!!!  I am going to be so sad when the series ends.  On to the next book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very good for someone who wants to have some brainless fun. It doesn't require any rigorous care for the virtual animal on a daily basis but their are competitions, grooming, feeding, excercises, and other tasks that are fun to complete. Additionally, there are accessories and riding neccessities that you can buy to increase your horses presentation. There are gems and coins used to buy things but they are relatively easy to earn within the game and it is not necessary to buy them. Overall, the game is the best game for taking care of a virtual pet that I have come across.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome I get to hang out on my server with friends or I get on there server this is a nice game and worth the money building and crafting is what this game is about!
B009AMANBA|2.0|i heard such good reviews on this movie, I purchased it.  ok, went to sleep in the middle.  pretty boring and not that historically factual
1401225756|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a very clever man.  I have not been dissappointed by anything I have read of his. Fascinating!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Incredible! !!!!  I couldn't put it down.  Even better than Slammed and Point of Retreat.  This is a story of falling in love and coping with abuse..  Have a Kleenex box close by.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Edge of your seat thriller. A right up your alley. Good guys in white hats fighting bad guys in black hats.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is just about like the game of yesteryear only better. It's easy to get started and has several playing levels. Another excellent game for the price of free.
B00BDZV9M4|4.0|I am not the average Lil Wayne fan, so maybe me word doesn't mean much for previous fans, but I really dig this album. Previously, my favorite Wayne album, Carter 3, was even mediocre at best in my eyes...I just never really dug more than a few songs from the man. However, I noticed he had a song with Juicy J on IANAHB2 and listened, which led to me listening to the rest of the album on Spotify. Being a huge Juicy J fan, I am very stoked about the entire album, as the beats and even rapping is very much in the Juicy J style. It is obvious that he was a huge influence in the making of this disc. Songs like Trippy, Trigger Finger and Gun Walk just scream of that Hypnotize Minds style.<br /><br />I am not seeing why this disc is getting so much hate, but like I said, I am not the average Lil Wayne fan, so since this album is an obvious departure from his previous style, I can see how it may turn off fans. However, I love the route Wayne is taking with this album and seriously hopes he continues; if so then he definitely has a new fan out of me.
B0064QNS62|5.0|So far I haven't had much of a chance to try this out. But at this point I think for the price (free), this is going to be a great game.
B000002GVO|5.0|Excellent buy and bought both Hotel California and Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975.  Very pleased with both! Great buy and value.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its got some good little games. fun and addicting I enjoy playing them it passes the time. my son also loves it
B008KOTNVA|5.0|iFixit 54 Bit Driver set offers a very good selection and the quality seems good.  May never use every bit included but it's nice to know you'll have whatever you need in the future.
030758836X|4.0|I can't give this review with out ONE SPOILER, so reader beware.  Girl Gone is a great novel, and nearly perfect in every way, except the ending, which, depending on your viewpoint, could range somewhere between so-so and horrid.  But, lets start with the good, because there is so much:  Great multi-dimensional characters that are easy to relate too, Really great 3-part mystery with major plot shifts adding a lot of intrigue and forcing the reader to take sides, then re-evaluate their choice, and good writing, written from both characters first person point of view, so you get this amazing back and forth, which is a great way to approach a novel about a couple's failing marriage (because each side will have their story where they are the victim).  This novel for me was a page turner that I couldn't put down, especially after you reach Part 2 and the plot really shifts into overdrive.  HOWEVER, now having said all this, we get to Part 3 of the story, and the plot really goes awry, much of the intrigue and mystery that was built up is suddenly knocked down and the reader has to suffer through the last 50 pages, hoping beyond hope that one of these two will \\"get theirs in the end\\", but alas, as much as this book starts off with a BANG, it ends with a WHIMPER.  I'm not sorry I ready it, and I still think its a great novel, but I think I could have written at least 2 better endings for this that would have given the reader some closure.
B007REV4T8|1.0|All dialogue is FEMALE ,,, when a male speaks it DOES NOT SOUND AUTHENTIC!<br /><br />All male dialogue SOUNDS FEMALE generated and EDITED! EVERY syllable uttered is &#34;sex-based&#34; and FEMALE derived! Pathetic bovine!<br /><br />Males DO NOT speak like that (in this movie) especially in highly charged situations.<br /><br />THIS MOVIE IS A BOVINE PRODUCTION AND SUCKS TO HIGH HEAVEN!<br /><br />We males are DOOMED to chick-flicks! written, produced, directed, screenplay YUCH!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I'd say this movie is kind of like Pride & Prejudice during the Industrial Age.  The actors are wonderful and have very good chemistry on screen. I have watched it many times and absolutely love it.
B003AVPV1O|3.0|Yep that's what it does. Reasonable price fast service and it works well. Beats Radio Shacks price and about as fast
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Great graphics. Easy to get gems and points<br />I wish I had more time with this game. Very addictive
B0049J0CTM|4.0|I love Finding Nemo!  This movie is a classic Pixar...can't wait until Finding Dory comes out in 2015.  &#34;Fish are friends, not food.&#34;
B00127RAJY|5.0|Absolutely loving this workout program.  This is the first Jillian Michaels workout video I have purchased and actually used or haven't quit because of boredom in a few days.  I am currently finishing up level 2 today (so I haven't even looked at level 3 yet) but I already have lost 3 to 4 inches and my muscle tone is really starting to gain some sculpted aspects.  I will say I am quite tall and lean for a female to begin with at 5'11&#34; and around 150 pounds.  (I purposely haven't kept track of my weight for this program, since weight isn't what matters to me).  I have always been athletic and athletically built throughout my entire life, but with a full time career and classes the last 4 to 5 years, I haven't had time to keep up with my physical activity at all.  Since I haven't been active for awhile, the first  3 days were rough, but after that your endurance really starts to pick up.  I also kept with  a 5 days a week workout schedule for this.  I still have two days of the week I CANNOT fit a workout into.<br /><br />After just level one and level two on that schedule there was a huge difference in my waist, hips and belly.  My belly (while not gnarly ripped) is completely smoothed down and I no longer have that little pudge at the bottom of my abs.  I even actually have some side obliques that are starting to show some definition.  (Never had those before!)  My little muffin top is also completely smoothed out along my waist and hips.  I literally think I may need to go down a size already.  I can also tell quite a huge difference in my back tightening up and not showing those &#34;bra lines&#34; from gaining a few pounds.  I even have some lightly defined biceps and triceps developing again!  However I will say I don't see as drastic changes in my legs or rear end.  I can tell they are much stronger and tighter though.<br /><br />Overall, I feel better, I look better, clothes are fitting better and I just feel energized each morning to start my day after this workout.  Jillian isn't annoying or overly overbearing.  She is motivating with out saying the same thing over, however by day 10 your look forward to a different routine and new narration!  This is a workout routine where I have heard a few individuals say they did not get any results and I don't believe they really, REALLY, tried to keep things challenging.  If you are following along with the hard level backup guide or Jillian it truly is a quick decently hard workout.  I don't see how you couldn't get results by the end, if you even try half way.
B0090EKRKU|4.0|This movie is a pretty good and imaginative translation on The Lorax.  I especially like how Danny DeVito is the voice of the Lorax.  Good movie for a family night.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My 6 and 10 year old love it! They said it is exactly like the movie. I'll give anything 5 stars if it keeps the two of them from driving each other nuts! They actually get along while playing this side by side on their kindle fires!!
B007JRU2UK|3.0|Not a big fan of this Indie push.  These movies and plots are getting very weird.  Like George Clooney in this movie.  He really does put on a great performance.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My granddaughter loved this movie and is a big fan of Disney movies.  Disney puts out good movies for kids and this is definitely one of them.  I am happy with my purchase.
B0086DBE62|2.0|Very bad interpretation of Snow White.  This is just part of the Fairy Tale remake movement.  This one did not pass over well with me.  Too bad for Julia Roberts...
B006LSZECO|5.0|It had a slow start but it quickly picked up and was so good, I could not put it down!
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|This movie boasts an all star cast, but the plot is lacking.  The jokes miss and it gets a little weird at times.  Not my favorite Cameron Diaz movie.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have always been a fan of Les Miserable so I wanted a blu-ray copy of it to look at when ever I want.
B00439MV42|5.0|Classic movie.  Love it every time I watch it.  Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are a hard to beat pair.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|This app allows me to do all sorts of cool things during meetings and such. Love it!<br /><br />Very cool app.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Yay this book is the greatest book ever it takes you behind the scenes to show you three incredible never before heard of adventures of Percy
0240815807|4.0|As a noob home studio producer, I have gotten much good information from this book. It really is a primer, and takes you step-by-step thru the process of mixing with lots of good tips and a sense of humor as well. My only real complaint is the author's self-portrayal as the ultimate authority on mixing. (See his description of the book above.) Some of his claims are controversial, to say the least (his strange rant about monitors where he recommends obsolete models, for example). All in all though, worth getting.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a really slick looking watch. The movement window in the back is cool and the day and date reader is easy to read. I switched the band because I didn't like the metal rings and I'm more of a leather watchband type.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This product was the worst case I have ever brought. First, because its &#34;water proof&#34; it blocks everything.... that includes sound. All my sound became muffled. Second, it is not waterproof 100%. Lastly, the plastic that covers the screen made it really hard to use touch screen. It is not ideal for touch screen. I had it on for one day and ended up taking it off and putting on my old one until I could get a new one!!
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I was forced to buy this album by the rap cartel.  They said they was gonna eat my brains.  Oh wait those were zombies.  Great album!
B00004SZWD|5.0|This is the best album(CD)of Stevie Wonder. He's given us many wonderful albums over the years, but this is by far my favorite.
0316228532|5.0|Cool mix of a formal 19th century novel and a gritty cockney look at suburban life. I love the feel and rhythm.
B0009QTS1M|1.0|I was very much looking forward to getting the directors cut of gladiator, but when it came in thr mail the only thing that suggested it was a directors cut was the sticker on the dvd cover. I was sent the standard version of the film that i could have gotten anywhere. And rather than go through the headache of returning it back to the careless people that shipped it, i gave it to patients at a hospital. Thats the only good thing that came from this waste of time and money. Next time you ship something to somebody, make sure that you check the item and make sure it is as advertised. Thanks for nothing, its been your pleasure.

B001L5J5GS|5.0|I have the original, first pressing 2 eye Columbia 'Chicago', (NOT the 'Chicago II' reissue, that was just another step down), which always sounded a little like a download, years before downloads existed. Finally, now that i am old, i am hearing this album for the first time in 'Hi-Fi'.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing! I would highly recommend this book to anybody who likes books about what could happen. GET THIS BOOK!
B007PAAO0Y|3.0|I was very pleased with what will likely be Bobby's last attempt at recording.  He is truly a great talent who has given us so much great music that I will always enjoy.  Though the voice has weakened with age, the spirit is still quite clear!

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I enjoyed the well developed characters but it's not a book I would pick up and read again. For having an angry drunk for a father, Abby was very quick to overlook Travis's drunk behaviors.
B008602KQI|4.0|May the odds be forever in your favor!<br /><br />These words will haunt you after you realize the significance of them. Poor Katniss Aberdeen is a native of district 12, an area where coal mining is the primary way of life. She lost her father in a mine collapse roughly 4 years ago and is struggling to support her 12 year old sister and mother. She takes to the woods to hunt for food. These hunting skills work in her favor when she volunteers to take the place of her sister for the 74th Hunger games.<br /><br />What are the hunger games, you ask? Two \\"tributes\\" from each of the 12 districts, 1 male and 1 female, are picked at random to participate in a ritual of anything goes war. All 24 are released in an environment and expected to fight until only one remains. Basically, being selected means your death certificate has been signed.<br /><br />\\"Catnip\\", her nickname, and her district 12 partner Peeta do exceptionally well and survive the first few nights of the Hunger Games. Not wanting to spoil anything, they outlast nearly half of their competition that died within the first few minutes of being released. Talk about a bloodbath!<br /><br />Why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? I've read some of the book and thought the movie glossed over some important things.<br /><br />1. In the beginning when Catnip climbs through the fence, she does it without any hesitation whatsoever. The book makes a big deal about her listening to the hum of it and how careful she is to make sure the power is turned off. There was no indication of this at all in the movie.<br /><br />2. I wasn't a fan of how the movie broke down the memory of Catnip and Peter. There wasn't really a reason to do it that way, and I think the scene actually should have been longer.<br /><br />3. The mockingjays seem to have a rich history about them in the book including the role they played in the rebellion,  but they play an extremely small part in the movie. A few more lines of dialogue in the hunger games woods with Rue could have helped the movie a lot.

B00B5JBZGS|5.0|Got this in great time. It's going to a birthday present for my husband. I am very happy about how fast I got it!
B000000OU0|5.0|Have wanted since this cd came out and just kept putting it off, finally decided it was time to purchase it. I have enjoyed listening to the music, and if you grew up during the rise of the Eagles you want this in your collection if you don't already have it.
0547848412|3.0|I liked the book it was nice, clean and highly enjoyable. If you like reading I'd recommend this book.<br />I rated it because of the book, the delivery was quick and the book was in great condition.
0385344228|4.0|I just read the book over the weekend. I couldn't put it down.  It's that good.<br /><br />I have to defend it against all the one-star reviews, especially those by lawyers and current or former prosecuting attorneys.  Nitpicks aside, this was highly believable in all respects. I felt the characters were well-drawn, fully fleshed out.<br /><br />I have a son who, as a teenager, got into (minor) trouble with the law and, had the local cops been more on the ball, could have gotten into deeper trouble. The thing is, my wife and I were both as oblivious as Jacob's parents to his potential to commit criminal acts. The Iago-like figure of the prosecutor Logiudice is also quite believable, as was his problem with the suspect the ADA Andy Barber wanted to pursue.<br /><br />I totally disagree with the reviewer who said the book's plot line is simple.  He said it call comes down to \\"a prosecutor's son is indicted for murder.\\"  You can make that kind of reductionist statement about any novel, certainly any crime novel. But there are several sub-plots and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing all the way to the final pages.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is a riveting and heart-breaking story with a very high level of crediblity.  And it's supremely entertaining.  In a few placess, I found the writing a weensy bit amateurish, but only a couple of times, otherwise I'd have given it five stars.
1451696191|4.0|The book was good, anyone who doesn't like talking about sex or anything of a sexual nature don't read it. Really, Mormon's probably wouldn't like this book. But I enjoyed it minus some of the parts where I felt like I had to take a shower. But it's a good book all together.<br />The book was in great condition when I got it.
B008602KQI|2.0|After reading many reviews for this movie, I had rather high expectations. Reviews such as the first one here on Amazon calling it a \\"Masterpiece\\". Perhaps this reviewer saw a different movie than I did. I know one thing. This movie is no masterpiece.<br /><br />This is a movie that I would consider a \\"B\\" movie. Not much of a budget, poor writing, costumes are a joke (think Rocky Horror costumes). It is the story that gives me the biggest problem. It is totally unbelievable. Yes, I know what type of movie it is, but still, for even this type of movie, the believability issue did not come close to hitting the mark. The acting is pretty bad. The lead actress is good, she holds the entire movie together. However, after the first ten minutes, you will see exactly what I mean. The movie never gets any better nor does the flow change. It is like a movie shot in ZombieVision.<br /><br />Basically, this movie is about kids killing other kids in an annual event. The contestants are chosen according to where they live. The young girl, the lead actress, goes along with it and of course, is the winner. Plot is totally predictable.<br /><br />I think this movie is one of those movies that people give a good review because others have. I have rented a lot of movies this year, watched a lot of free ones with Prime and on Netflix. Honestly, this movie rates as one of the poorest this year.<br /><br />Masterpiece? Even for free, I would not recommend this movie unless you are really bored and have nothing else whatsoever to do.<br /><br />A rating of 2 stars. The lead actress got the additional star.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app so much. I recommend this app to people who love games<br />that. Have fun upgrading people and boards in this exciting game.
B00742GBDM|1.0|I wanted to view it on my TV and your app prevented airplay from my iPad so I wasted my 2 bucks.<br /><br />I couldn't find it on my blue Ray either.<br /><br />I ended up paying more for iTunes
B009JBZH54|5.0|Perfecto, están en excelente calidad, y los extras se ven muy bien, fue una excelente compra la que realicé. Muchas Gracias
B00004W221|5.0|Great movie, especially if you like the underdog, Notre Dame or football in general.  It's a tear-jerker and good for the entire family.  The theme never gets old.
0439023521|5.0|I read this book straight through- which hardly ever happens, since I usually read when I can't sleep. This one kept me up and turning the pages.<br /><br />It's brilliantly written. The world and the plot and the characters are dead-on precisely drawn, and very coherent.<br /><br />I've been late trying this series, but I am very eager to continue.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Very fun town defense game. You can also use collected souls to get items from the multiplayer mode (or better yet steal items from strangers or even from friends) .
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I was so excited to view this movie but found the voices of non-professional singers simply ruined the movie for me.  I could only stand watching for about 20 minutes.  So sorry I purchased it......I will stick with the play!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|My son loves this game.  He thinks it's a great alternative to super Mario. Great for a free app. I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Such a different story and extremely well written. Love all the twists and turns.  Surprises st every turn.  ENJOY......
0756404738|4.0|Make sure you read a Naming of the Wind first or this book won't be as enjoyable on it's own.  A a sequel however, this is a great continuation of the first story which is one of the best I have read since starting the Dresden Files a few years back.  I found this book very difficult to put down despite it's length.
B003O7I6L6|5.0|This Blu-ray version is infinitely superior to the original DVD release.  Like most of John Carpenter movies of this era, he creates an other-worldly mood with great sets and musical design.  A true 80's gem.
0345803485|2.0|I found this book too explicit and detailed about the couple in it. Was expecting a romance novel. Did receive it pretty quick though.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Overall, this is a great collection with nice packaging.  I did notice a strange out-of-focus sequence in \\"The Last Crusade\\" when all of the main characters are riding together in a convertible.  It only lasts a few seconds, but I don't remember this problem on the DVD release.  When Amazon puts collections like this on sale for 60% off retail, you simply can't pass them up.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|The kids love watching some old classics with us.  Enjoying it while we can, and we will have the movies for the future.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I loved the suspense of the story which kept me reading most of the days.  There  was a lot of descriptions of guns as to how they worked, etc. which I could have done without but maybe the guys enjoyed that much information.  Over all,  very good.
0765325950|5.0|The ending left a smile on my face, many fans who started this series at its beginnings had to wait many years for the end of the story. They were finally rewarded when the widow Mrs. Jordan let an up and coming writer Mr. Sanderson go through her late husband's well written manuscripts, to complete the cliff hanging series. Thank you Mrs. Jordan, it could not have happened without your love for your dearly departed spouse and your devotion to his well written stories. Because of you, he lives, because of your chosen writer to complete the series the story has been completed as intended. I read a few books by Mr. Sanderson and liked what I read, when I found out that he was chosen to complete the Wheel of time series, it just felt right. Hopefully the &#34;Way of Kings&#34; sequel will be as intended too, or greatly expanded to develop its many characters.
B0002234LS|3.0|The movie ended up working fine, but was shipped loose in the plastic container.  The DVD itself is very scratched from being loose.
B0091THRCU|2.0|This case is well constructed, made with what appears to be good leather, but it has one big flaw, the iPhone 5 doesn't fit inside. Te case really is to snugg, to slim, that it becomes unusable. When I get it, I put the phone inside, with force (it don't go easy inside) and what a mistake, I have to sweat, really sweat, to get it out.<br />Then I tried to let the case in the sun, fit an iPhone 4 to see if it became a little lose, but not a chance, it keep its form and size (a testament to good construction?).<br />So, maybe if they make a similar case with a little more space inside will be a good product.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|This was the perfect CD to buy.  I loved the music and the purchase was easy to negotiate.<br /><br />Nan Singh Bowman
B008JFUTT0|4.0|I can understand why the documentary won an Oscar.  Kept my interest.  Would highly recommend an individual(s) to watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is beast I play it all the time and I like all the characters and I think and a lot of people should have the game and rate a 5 star review for the game.
1416968725|4.0|Great book.  I bought one that was a former library book, and now wish I hadn't.  Can't remove cover without damaging the book.  But it is clean, readable and a really cute book that was very inexpensive!
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Brilliant film..1st rate acting and set design. Daniel Day-Lewis was born for this role.<br />I highly recommend this film for everyone.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has a great CD.  I love every song on it.  I look forward to more music from her.  Thanks
B002SSUQFG|5.0|As you would expect from Seiko, this watch is well-made, nicely finished, and inexpensive enough to wear every day without worry. The Malaysian-made automatic movement is a workhorse and time-tested, having powered the famous \\"Monster Diver\\" series for years.  (Unusual for a mechanical movement, this one has been running very accurately from day one.)  I feared the canvas strap would not be durable, but it looks brand-new; the reinforced back prevents fraying from wear.  I've had this watch for about a year, and there are no scratches on the case or crystal.<br /><br />This watch is only 38mm in diameter, a bit small for a man's watch today, but it looks fine on an average-sized man.  I've had many compliments on it, since the watch looks much more expensive than it actually is (a friend of mine immediately bought himself one, when I told him the price).<br /><br />For the money (with the assurance of Amazon's good customer service), you can't go wrong on this one!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love any type of jig saw or crossword puzzles.  It helps me to keep my mind sharp and entertains me as well.
B0042816YK|4.0|First, this is not a review of the movie; instead, this is about the DVD.<br />I chose the DVD because it is the most portable for all players in the household. The choices were either DVD or Blu-ray; no Blu-ray combo packs, Ultraviolet, or digital copies, therefore we had to go with the lowest common denominator for all player types from laptops to dedicated players.<br />The DVD does include both the theatrical version and the unrated director's cut, so this is at least some consolation. However, in this day of 'play anywhere anytime', this product does not measure up, even though it is priced the same as those that do provide more portability.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a fantastic game to play and it has a lot strategies and I love the strategy I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is much better than temple run temple run 2 all the angry birds and fruit ninja.
030758836X|4.0|The book starts off slow--we are given the current status of Nick and Amy's relationship from Nick's point of view and things sound mundane. The narration flips between Nick's current day perspective and Amy's diary that delves into their past, when they were first in love and googly-eyed. All seems normal, though their marriage is slowly disintegrating.<br />Next, Amy goes missing. Nick is not the best husband--he does not behave like a normal husband would, crying, or showing any emotion at all. He seems as bewildered as the reader as to where Amy went. It's not like she had any friends, because she was antisocial. So where could she go?<br />As Nick becomes sketchier, the reader doesn't know whose point of view is the truth. Nick and Amy describe their relationship very differently. I kept trying to like one of the narrators, but the author keeps turning the tables and doesn't let you like a character enough before she reveals a character flaw that turns you off.<br />This book has shocks, violence, and very manipulative characters. It will make you frustrated, scared, annoyed, and tired from staying up trying to get to the end.<br />Was it worth it? I believe it was. At the very least, it makes a good story to share with your friends.<br />\\"Hey, I'm reading this book where the wife goes missing and you start to suspect the husband BUT..... AND THEN.... FINALLY....\\" while your friend is enthralled by your brilliance.
B0091REZMW|3.0|One step at a time but so far it's a decent game.<br />I get excited every time I get to unlock a room=-)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Heartfelt and serious is how I would describe this book. It makes you aware of all the pain of losing someone no matter of how much time you spend with them.<br />Read it. You won't be disappointed.
0679746048|3.0|I loved the plot, storyline.. a story that needs to be told.I really liked all the characters buy wish more information had been given about them. The book seems to mention them and add a little bit from time to time but just enough to keep you wondering and at times frustrated. The actual hospital, doctor notes added flavor to the whole book. I admit I picked it up and couldn't put it down, read through it two sittings but there was something lacking.I liked the perspective from the patient, the girl herself.<br />The only problem I had was.. I wanted more information. It seemed to be too quick of a read for the story that it was. There has to be more info and happenings. I felt like the whole story was not told in a way. I am not sure how to rate this...<br />I also wondered if our main character really had that severe of a mental issue...I know there were issues but that was a long time to be hospitalized. I guess that is why I thought the book should have been longer as she was in the hospital a long time. I did love the title!!!
B000RJO578|5.0|Hot Fuzz gives the right amount of comedy and action to this movie. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are the bee's knees. Got package on time and in great condition.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey's music is amazing. The only thing better than listening to her cd is seeing her live in concert! Love her
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Will temple run 2 is awesome because u can bet you own score or your friends score I bet  my score and my friends that what like about temple run lol deuse
B0075TDWEU|4.0|Very good sound, a comfortable, flexible head design, easily removable and lightweight. A rather poor design for fitting into the normal ear, even keeping in mind how all ears differ, the ends might have fitted better if made out of flexible rubber. Much better than many of their in-the-ear offerings.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Performed as expected.  Good movie. Good movie.  This is text to satisfy your requirement even though I have nothing more to say.
B005VPRG10|5.0|my grandson enjoyed it and was very happy and building it was just perfect for him. Good boy gilt / toy
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This particular show continues to wrap you up in its web of wonderful.  You are never bored and each ending leaves you ready for the next.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Unique and addictive gameplay, great music!  There are a variety of ways to play the game, and they are all challenging and enjoyable.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I love this movie. I'm a syfy nut so ones like this are great. It was very entertaining too me!
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Please do watch this movie if you enjoy suffering and outlandish fiction!  I am amazed by the horrifying nature of the storyline.
B00142X56Y|5.0|Just mad a major investment in upgrading our home theater and thought I'd expand beyond Diana Krall, the Eagles, and other &#34;pop&#34; concerts. Very enjoyable and amazing voices. Having the subtitles helps this opera noob follow what's going on while enjoying the talents of the singers the orchestra and the wonder of Mozart's talent. A great starter for anyone looking to &#34;get into&#34; opera.
0307386171|3.0|Ian McEwan has so conditioned me to expect a long ambling cowpath to the climax, that it is now beginning to detract from my enjoyment. On Chesil Beach is no exception. The long lulling into a kind of sleepy discomfort about the two unlikeable protagonists will come to a violent and sticky end. We all know that. This is a McEwan novel after all. Edward's sexual predation will be confronted by Florence's asexuality - just keep turning the pages. Those who like their stories to run to schedule will be pleased with this novel. Personally I would have liked Mr McEwan to break from the well worn track. For all that, it is still the work of an exceptional writer.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|The whole family enjoys this movie. Fun twist on the holidays we all enjoy and the joy they represent to our children.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Clapton is still the best.  All the songs on this are soulful and touching.  I wish he'd put out a new CD every year.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Another installment of the LOTR trilogy.  Great movie, great battle scenes and has a lot that was not included in the original film.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|its pretty decent. wish it didn't timen you between check points. over all I like.it. its kinda like.Mario kart.  and I like Mario kart
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun and simple to play. I love it. Would recommend it to any one who is looking for a game that doesn't need &quot;neighbors&quot; to complete tasks for you
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Our 8 and 10-year-old boys love this game.  They have so much fun with it even though they often have to wait for extended periods to get things!  It's a great way for them to learn patience!
B00000G3AZ|2.0|I was disappointed to discover that in the middle of the movie, captions come on and you can't turn them off.  At the end of the chapter, you can stop the movie and start it again and the captions go away, but for the one chapter, they stay on.<br /><br />Despite getting it for only $1, it is still disappointing to buy something, pay for shipping, and then find out it is damaged.  It is not honest of the seller.
0762777931|5.0|I always love Kris's books. Her writing style is easy and fun to read. The recipes are excellent, too. I highly recommend the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice game me and my brother loved it we both love how the cop chasing the surfer outfit changes every season and/or holiday best yet I love how there be  New characters every month!! This game is awesome.
0743201140|4.0|This book was recommended by Marie Forleo with B School. It was an extremely insightful book that helped me understand my learning style.
B008OOYALE|3.0|The game is very similar to Dragonvale, but is harder to navigate, the graphics are not as good, just not as engaging.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|If played my fair share of games based on the same platform. And I always run out of energy in the game. Game loft has made this problem,not a problem at all. Where other games made you buy energy with special points that cost actual money. In World At Arms. Energy can be bought using cash earned in the game. Which is a huge plus in my opinion.
B005H29GSI|5.0|My family all sat on the floor together and played this, kids ages 4 and 7 and the grown ups to. For the younger kids you can just set the ice and pigs how you want or for older people follow the deck of cards. Very entertaining for everyone.
B004GJYROG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies....I buy this movie for all my nephews and my niece.  It is a movie that we never grow tired of and a movie that I love seeing Michael Jordan in.  There are so many stars in this movie and watching Jordan in his heyday....no home should be without this movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|like it.  very nice game keeps me occupied wish you could do more hands on type things. like it like it like it like it like it
0783116934|5.0|This telling of one of Russia's most prolific serial killers told through the eyes of the ones who caught him.  Great story and another home run from HBO Pictures!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal minds never disappoints. Even without Paget Brewster as Emily Prentiss, Criminal Minds has very creative and in-depth characters, as well as the writers, in this series.
B00A196SE2|5.0|its too bad they cancelled the series, it is a great story in a unique place, love New York and Gossip Girl
0470913029|5.0|It explains the paleo diet and gives u list to work with. There is alot of food to eat on this book too which makes the diet easeir.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This is the best Jane Eyre version I have ever watched. The cast, especially Mia Wasikowska, did a amazing job. I love the settings and the lighting. Of course, as a Jane Eyre fan, I wish the movie could be longer but this is the best version so far.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this movie and my copy has flawless color and sound.<br /><br />Was excited to get it in such a timely fashion  :)
B0001I561E|5.0|No problems, arrived quickly - works great!<br />Was happy to find it and my son loves it, too!<br /><br />Thanks  Claire
1849386684|4.0|I didn't know as many of the songs as I thought I did, but that's what youtube is for, right?<br /><br />This book is well thought out, with the chords for each section clearly diagramed and strum patterns illustrated.  It's easy to read and having the spiral binding is wonderful!<br /><br />Thanks, Justin.
B002NZK5QY|5.0|I teach a music appreciation course for junior high and this far exceeds any educational film I could show. Not only is it an excellent storyline but the music, the showing of serious and comic opera and of the life and politics of the times, emphasizes everything I teach. It brings it all into focus for the students.  They love it! I do fast forward through a beginning scene that is age inappropriate.  When I first started showing it, it was not rated. Now. I've had to edit the film to be acceptable for my students.<br /><br />I have loved this film since I first saw it in the theaters!  I have been watching it for at least thirty five years and will continue to do so for years to come!
B00005CDNJ|4.0|Love the music and listened to it in cassette form as a high school student in the 80s and now buying it in CD is way cheaper than itunes.
B000007492|5.0|I have gotten my young granddaughters hooked on Supertramp. We love their music especially on long road trips to doctors appts that are hours away for my youngest GD.
B000AL5OZK|4.0|Awesome pop music. Too bad she's not well known and still eclipsed by Abba even though her album has some great dance/work out and easy listening music.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to use and read. I like it. You can do everything  just like any other calculator.  It is a great free app.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Buen producto. Buena calidad, una de las mejores peliculas que he visto. para verla en familia. Diferente y fresca y muy entretenida.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Many people have had issues with this app resetting their progress and I did as well, although that bug has hopefully been fixed.<br />Graphics: Wonderful. There is so much detail to them, small things that make the game better. Especially on a larger tablet screen (I'm on a Kindle), it's amazing the detail to it. The map is so large and expansive, I find myself stumbling upon new locations every time I play, and actually have difficultly relocating some places.<br />Game controls: Almost flawless. There's either tilt to control, where you tilt your device to change the direction of the shark, or touch control (my preference) where a joystick appears where you touch the screen and that is used for the controls.<br />The game itself, while a simple concept (eat and survive), is fairly complex. There are fish like jellyfish which injure your shark, and fish that make attack your shark when you try to eat them. As you move up to more advanced sharks, you are able to eat a wider variety of fish. There are upgrades available for your shark, and although you can use actual money to purchase gems, spending real money on the game is completely unnecessary. The game is easy enough that you can level up without much difficulty, but it's not so easy that you can level up quickly.<br />Overall, I find the combination explore/survive aspects of the game a nice combination, and I recommend it to all my friends (and they love it!). If you're unsure, definitely download it, you will not regret it.
B004SMDJ9U|2.0|I tried watching this show and really wanted to like it. I forced myself to watch 2 more episodes after the pilot. I was hoping it would get better....it did not! Maybe I should have given it more time, but if after 3 episodes I am still forcing myself then I figure it is time to move on. There are too many good shows out there to bother with this one. The premise was good, the execution was NOT! The characters really did seem to be one dimensional and just full of what they thought were cute quips. The only redeeming quality in the 3 episodes I saw was the character of &#34;Duke&#34; and they didn't show enough of him for me to stick with it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Me and my kids love this app it's amazing good job just wish they gave more gems and a lot more coins and they need to make the sharks more cheaper it's too expensive even the items need to be cheaper
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I bought this for my dad for his birthday because that's what he wanted.  i have never watched it but i'm going to assume it is pretty good.
B00AES0AZI|5.0|This has it all. Intrigue drama and a Golden Retreiver.<br />Knoonz at his very best in a Dog Gone grrreat story.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Fun game no lie. If you like fun games you will like this game. Because It's fun. Honest.  If it wasn't fun I would say that. But it happens to be fun so I am telling you that instead.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|&#34;Wreck-It Ralph&#34; is a fun movie for the whole family, and the different viewing options offered with the 3D Blu-ray combo pack make this an excellent purchase option.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good brain exercise. Not so challenging that it drives you crazy, but challenging enough to keep me wanting to play again.
B001XUPF2O|5.0|What can you say about this that has not been said? Bale is perfect as Batman. Heath Ledger is pure genius, and I use genius only because I can't think of an even better superlative, as the Joker. Gary Oldman does his usual perfect job.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is a treasure. With just the right mixture of suspense and humor, this one is a winner.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game!!! On the new update, Its sooo cool!! There is now creative and Dragons! But since its a 20 word minimum, I cant tell u everything&hellip; GET THIS FREAKING APP!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can not put it down. I even play during class lol(NOTGOOD) I simply lovethis game and my kids do too.
B002H3T3TM|1.0|i think i would really enjoy this product if it was a dvd  i either ordered wrong or was sent the product.  i wrote an email but never received an answer.  :(
B002LB13SE|5.0|This movie scared the bejeezus out of me and had me screaming at the tv.  Just great stuff totally worth the rental.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Such a nail biter! Well written, great story, original and unique in the telling. I finished it in two days because I decided that reading it was better than sleeping. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I am someone who reads voraciously and this book is in my top ten for sure.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|I like this but do not love it. I would rather not have as much electronic music involved,<br />but I am old school. As an aging white guy, I would rather just have the music flow without<br />interruption. I am not the target audience.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Masterfully written, the saga continues.  The characters are like old friends. I wish I had the next book in my hands.
0920668364|5.0|This is the best book ever that I read my children when they were infants, I cried every time I read it to them. Great book for all ages. Recommend highly.
B00821OX98|5.0|I looked at this with skepticism.... but I had to see the next episode... and the next... and the next.  Good scifi.. it is  a little &#34;schlocky&#34; but the character motivations go beyond the survival of the race.  The aliens are not overpowered nor are they just trying to &#34;take over&#34;...  they are enslaving children and using them to really keep  everyone on the run and the &#34;resistance&#34; have more fractures than &#34;General Hospital&#34;.... There is a little here and there to keep everyone interested.... some scenes are very violent so please don't let the kiddies who are still watching &#34;Barney&#34; to see this,  12 and older though I think is cool.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once I started watching this mini series I was hooked.  Watched them on DVD to start.  We had just purchased a Smart TVv and I was able to download from Amazon the most recent ones.  Once I was caught up,  I watched the rest on TV.  It's very easy to do!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I was very happy to have found & receive this movie. It's hilliarious, action, fast pace, exciting & romantic. I've seen it now about 10 times, because I always find I missed something the first two times that I didn't see before. I rated a five star movie because it's that good. I love all the stars...wonderful team, especially Bruce, Morgan & Helen.
