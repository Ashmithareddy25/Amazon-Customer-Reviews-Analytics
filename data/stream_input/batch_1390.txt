B006L4MWVE|4.0|\\"Today's lesson is you kill each other off 'til there's only one left. Nothing's against the rules.\\"  After the fall of the Japanese economy and anarchy breaks out, the government has begun the \\"Battle Royale\\" act.  Forty-two 9th grade students are chosen to compete is a \\"game\\". 3 days 1 island and 1 winner. Either you kill the others or you die. I have to admit that I have never read \\"The Hunger Games\\" books but based off of what I know about it this is very similar. This movie was made in 2000 so I'm not sure it is being ripped off or not but I have to say that this movie was great. Very bloody and violent and is not for the squemish. The movie is a little cheesy in parts, but that's to be expected from the country that gave us \\"Godzilla\\". Not saying that's a bad thing but it is a little over the top in a few places. All that said I recommend this highly and if you can handle it watch it. I also have to say that I will compare \\"The Hunger Games\\" movie to this one and it has to be amazing to be better then this one for me. Overall, a movie that totally surprised me as to how good it was. I give it an A-.
0385474547|5.0|This book was my second favorite book I read last year. The book is written from the perspective of an African folk writer, in his native town. The writing has a rhythm, almost as if a drum was playing while you read the book. The culture is dramatically different from our own, so everything in the book needs to be taken with an open mind. Much of the book focuses on the relationships the main character develops; which connects very strongly with the reader. It is a very simple read, and is only a mere 130 pages or so. If anyone ever wants to sit down and be immersed in a different culture, this is the book for you!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app. A few typos in new king James but love the easy navigation. great way to spread the word of God.

030788743X|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best Gen X books I've ever read.  Having grown up at the same time as Halliday, I get practically every reference that Cline has used.  I haven't had a book hook me this hard in a loooong time.  I was making excuses to take time to read it.  I can't wait for his follow-up to this.

B003O86FMW|5.0|My husband and I both read this book. It is the second one in the Hunger Games trilogy. We loved it - couldn't put it down!!!
B004ODLUGM|5.0|We first rented this DVD from the redbox on a whim; watched it 3 times before returning it and then ordered it from Barnes and Noble.  Then I decided it was such an awesome (short) movie that I purchased another 4 DVDs to give as gifts.  I'm about to give out the last one, and am thinking of ordering more.  It's that good.<br /><br />I can't wait for The Gruffalo's Child movie to become available in the US!!!!
0425221806|5.0|Travis is depressed at life and descides to go for a hike in the hills. He comes across a golden retriver who seems to go crazy. Barking and snapping as he warns Travis to leave the woods. Travis is lonely and descides maybe adopting the clever dog is a worthy risk. Turns out the dog brings not only companionship, but danger as something is stalking the dog. Along with the federal government. How much will Travis risk to keep mans best friend?<br />I don't think there is anyway to explain this book without spoiling a little of it. My brother told me about this a long time ago and said it was about a smart dog. That's all he said and I read and loved it. Even the few lines I wrote above spoils the first scene. This is one of Koontz best and a must read. It has amazing characters. All of them. It has horror and humor. Buy this book and read it several times.<br /><br />SPOILER.<br />Here's my first description but it spoils too much.<br /><br />Koontz has the US government at it again. After playing with DNA they come up with two successes. A beautiful golden retriever that seems as smart as humans, and a monster built to be a deadly killing machine. The dog escapes the government lab, and the monster, who hates the dog, follows him, killing everything in it's path. Koontz dazzles us again with wonderful characters, humor, and bone chilling terror. This is a eye opening tale you will not forget.<br />Koontz makes every character shine, but my favorite is Nora. She's a mousy, introverted type who's been mentally abused by her aunt for twenty plus years. Nora thinks all men are evil, and that she's plain. It's a ordeal for her to even leave the safety of her house. Travis is depressed believing everyone he loves will soon die. Hopefully things will change when they meet the dog. Add in some horror/humor with a seriel killer who thinks he's becoming immortal with each murder he commits. The monster who's also smart and likes to taunt his victems. Even putting body partson display for the police to find! But most of all don't forget the friendly, loyal, lovable dog to steal the show.<br />This book is PG13 for the horror and some gore. Overall the book isn't that scary. It's even light as the dog carries the storyline. But there are about three scenes that are some of the scarriest I've ever read. Koonts goes into so much detail that we even hear the monster scraping his nails as he taunts his victems. I was leaning forward in my seat mentally screaming \\"Get out of there!\\"<br />This is no doubt one of Koontz best and a great place to start for modern readers looking for more reading  material.

B000G6R7B8|5.0|In a world where people use cell phones as their time keepers, fewer and fewer people wear wristwatches.  Most people that wear watches have no idea what a nice watch is. To them a wristwatch is something to make a fashion statement.  This watch doesn't make a fashion statement. With it's tan face and modest styling, this watch is probably too conservative to be noticed in the fashion world.  To even consider buying this watch a person must have at least a basic knowledge of watches.  This watch doesn't keep time as well as a cheaper watch with a quartz movement, it is classier than that.  This is a Seiko 5.<br />  A Seiko 5 has five functions; hour, minute, second, day and date.  I've had mine for several months now and am extremely satisfied with it.  It loses about two minutes a month, but that is a small price when considering that it is a mechanical watch.  I've owned much more expensive watches that didn't keep time nearly a good as this one.<br />  This watch is waterproof enough to shower with, but I haven't been swimming with it on.

B0040JHXTI|5.0|The pressure of the magazines covers was behind the band.  The legal hassle was in the rear view mirror.  E Street was  ready to head out on the highway and show the world what it could do.  Incredible tracks...the surplus tunes were better than what a lot of bands were putting out.  The Houston show was a classic and reminds one of what the early shows were like, feeling the compression of the bass bouncing  off your chest, the deafening volume numbing the hearing yet crystal clear vocals, piano, organ and guitar work.  And then there was Big Man's sultry sax riffs.  The notebook (scrapbook) brings insight into the mindset of the band as they were laying it out.  The CD's bring life to the track work.  The video's bring life to the nostalgic, melancolic memories of a youth that was celebrated.  And now, with  this this set, it can be relived and enjoyed and celebrated over and over and over.  Thank you Bruce, thank you E Street...thank  you all for making a youth worth living, a youth worth remembering and especially for bringing it all back...Thanks.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Well I thougt the book was really well written and faced paced and VERY interesting but all the charecters you grow to like:<br />  Spoiler Alert<br /><br />Finnick Odair and Primrose Everdeen she also made Gale grows distant from katniss so you dont see him often and then dont get me started on the end. Katniss and Peeta practically died the way they were acting. The whole ending was terrible but other than that i loved the entire series
0061992860|5.0|What more can I say that hasn't been said already? The fact is this is the most comprehensive survival book ever written and in a bug out situation one would be a fool not to have this book handy at all times. Definitely could be the difference between life and death. Worth every penny.

B002LAM7PI|5.0|I watched this at school and it was wonderful!<br />Coraline is about a girl that moves to a new house that she hates. When she finds a secert door to another world, she relises it's everything she ever wanted. The strange thing is that everyone has button eyes but the cat and the cat can talk. Soon Caroline finds out that the place is not as good as it seems.<br /><br />The movie is a little creepy so i would recommend that the people that watch it are ages 10+ (there is also the fact that it is rated PG)<br /><br />I didn't watch it in 3D and from the other reviews i wouldn't recommend watching it in 3D.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great movie. I would recommend it to anyone 10+ .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this series!  I was glued to the pages and I found myself staying up very late reading because I couldn't put it down.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Okay, I have to admit that I hated the first book but I'm warming up to these characters. I see some promise in Christian. The relationship really moved in this one. I'm still not keen on the weakness of Ana's character. The excessive use of adverbs also took me out of the story which was a shame because the basic premise of the story is really fantastic! Also the excessive usage of Holy (add any multitude of swears) was disturbing and annoying. I was always told to limit the use of adverbs and to use strong verbs to convey your message. IDK. I gave this book a three for the plot, the characterization and overall appeal of the story. Don't know if I'll read three or not. Maybe I'll stop here and keep my fond memories of book two.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|i must admit, this show is full of ups and downs.  At one point I almost gave up on it, but i the end it all comes together and you understand that good is rising and winter is coming!  The quality of the production is amazing, Blockbuster special effects, and the actors are well cast and good (for a change).  One of the most engaging series I have seen in a long time.  Because they are following the plot of books, the show never wanders into ridiculous (as so many others have!)  It feels like the plot is carefully crafted, intricately woven and going somewhere.<br /><br />Seeing some of the good characters get beat is hard, but as the plot continues to unfold, you realize the wisdom in that.  An old generation is ending so that new can rise up.  And in the final episode it all makes sense!  Can't wait to see more.<br /><br />Too bad that HBO doesn't allow you to subscribe to their content online unless with a TV provider.  My provider isn't listed so I can's subscribe to their content, which in this modern world just seems wrong.  Wonder why HBO doesn't come into the 21st Century?  I will have to wait a long time to see the second season.  Not a reason to subtract a star from my review, but still !!!  Seems like if you are willing to be a paying customer they wouldn't turn you away.
B004LWZW8I|1.0|How can a movie take the great story of Theseus and turn it into mush? You get the feeling that whoever wrote the script knew absolutely nothing about the story they were trying to tell. Just making it up as they went along. This is just another in a line of movies lately , 300, Clash of the titans, and Avatar that take a great story and butcher it. The trend today in movies seems to be all mindless action and visuals. but little story. When all someone can say about a movie is that it \\"looks good\\", then it's a movie to avoid. I suppose it has appeal to those who aren't very discriminating in their tastes. But anyone who wants a movie that's deeper than a piece of paper should avoid it.
1932100660|5.0|This is a wonderful book. There is so much to learn in it.  One thing that helped me, is blood test factors that indicate disease. Almost every page has something new. His concepts on nutrition are well proven, and he has published over 160 articles on them in medical journals.  Yet old concepts die hard.  Many doctors will ignore his findings and use older methods to treat disease. Many in the public will not accept drastic changes in their diet.  But if someone is suffering, they will gladly change their diet to prolong life. I think doctors should inform everyone of the nutrition option.<br />My wife and I went on the diet he recommends 3 months ago.  We both have more energy and have lost weight. I did not need to lose weight, but did lose about 9 pounds and then stabilized.  She likes being able to eat all she wants, and still lose. I was always a big meat eater, but now I hardly ever eat it.  I don't miss it at all. I would not change from my new diet now. For example, I love the veggie meals, snacking on fruits all day, and eating pieces of dense whole wheat bread.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone!

B0065GC0BA|5.0|I just want this book to get all the attention it deserves.  More than the Black Dagger Brothers, more than the Fifty Shades of Grays.  A genuinely gorgeous book from start to finish.

0756686970|2.0|We got this book for our son from another website, in a bundle deal at Christmas time, but I wanted to review it so people would be aware of this. He is 6 and loves this book, and has handled it very carefully and we keep it on our coffee table, so it hasn't been in the playroom/toybox, etc. at all. Since he's just learning to read, we read things to him a lot from it, and are handling it ourselves. However, the book fell apart this past week, less then 3 months old! The entire book came apart on the inside of the spine, and then ripped from the inside of the back cover. This is very disappointing, as there is no way we can return it, having bought it online, in a bundle Lego deal. He LOVES the information in the book, though. We are going to try to glue it back together!

0743455967|2.0|I found this book to be dull, boring, and a slow read. The first part was a little interesting; about his childhood. Then it turned into a \\"how to\\" write like him.  Not my favorite book AT ALL.
B003WUYP56|3.0|This is a discussion worth having. The author rebuts the Physics' community's almost slavish acceptance of string theory w/o that theory's providing any experimental verification of its' premises. The author goes on to state that this acceptance has precluded many avenues of other research that are promising but remain barely explored due to the inordinate resources devoted to string theory.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author's work fails to foster any passion in the reader to change this state of affairs. He fails to realize that physics advances only in the true presence of genius. Such men as Newton and Einstein are rare and will only be provided in God's good time.

B006JTS5OO|5.0|We are quite careful about what movies and television programs we let our two young children (3 and 4) watch. As life long Muppet fans, we were very excited to learn a new Muppet movie was released, but we were still cautious about whether it would be appropriate for our children. Our little ones have watched snippets of some of the old Muppet Show bits, so they were familiar with all the original characters. My husband and I pored over reviews trying to decide whether to take our kids to the movie. We finally decided that we'd give it a try, and boy, are we glad we did! It was an excellent movie to share with our kids. All four of us were singing along to the main song by the end of the film. There were a couple of things that made us groan (a character named \\"Uncle Deadly\\" for example), but they were really minor and our kids didn't seem to notice. Our girls loved the movie and getting to watch something that we loved from our childhood with our children made it even more special for my husband and me. We downloaded most of the songs to our iPod, and \\"Life's a Happy Song\\" and \\"Mah Na Mah Na\\" are in heavy rotation in our house. We can' wait for the movie on Blu-Ray!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Like many, I cringed when I first saw the trailer to this film. To me, it looked like nothing but a bad exploitation of 9/11. When it was released, the mixed to negative critical reviews were enough to convince me to stay away from it. After this film shockingly received a Best Picture Nomination from the Oscars, I decided to head down to the multiplex and see what it was all about.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, I didn't see any of the manipulative 9/11 pandering that the critics were describing. Instead I discovered a good-intentioned movie about a young boy that tragically lost his father.<br /><br />While Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and Max Von Sydow are all good in the film, the real star of the film is the boy played by Thomas Horn. He plays a character of such emotional complexity with force and conviction. In my opinion, he was robbed of an Oscar Nomination for Best Lead Actor.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this film to people of all-ages. Just a warning ahead of time: Make sure to have a tissue box close to you!
0596805527|5.0|It helps me to understand the depth of javascript and I'm ejoying it . It's really a nice book. It deserved the five stars.
B005OTGS4E|1.0|This is advertised as one of the first of the commando raids by a new British undercover team going up against a crack SS Alpine unit. But in the film, the only thing these Germans are good at shooting at is the local civilian population. When they have to go up against the British Commandos it's a turkey shoot with the SS dropping like flies. It reminded me of the the old Combat series where Sarge and Hanley mowed down wave after wave of hapless Germans. It was cliche filled as one other reviewer mentioned and you may have deja vu when you watch it, thinking you have seen it before. The first part of the movie is your standard in training drills with a Scottish version of Lee Emery showing the potential commando recruits the ropes. There was just nothing new here. I was going to give a star and a half for the uniforms, but you can't do half star's. I usually keep the war movies, but this one was so bad, I tossed it.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Movie is good as expected.  I seen it previously and did know what to expect.  It arrived very quick and was in very good condition.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Well, i just sat through a tasteless and bland script of a film on Blu-Ray. How bloody boring it is. The camera-work on the actor's faces when noone talked put me to sleep. Was hoping for a balls out, fast paced, high-speed driving movie. How wrong was i? I'd rather watch paint dry. I think the Ryan Gosling acting scenes concentrated on him just staring and not speaking for most of the movie. In final, a boring-ass-movie with no pedal to the metal in it at all.

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire is the second book in Suzanne Collin's \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy. We start right after Katniss and Peeta have won their version of the Hunger Games and are coming back home to a world that has changed. Throughout the book we learn of rebellions, the Hunger Games Quarter Quell begin, and the mysteries behind the disappearance of District 13. This is a masterful middle to the trilogy. A book that continues the journey of placing the reader in Katniss' mind and this book has definitely made me a fan of Suzanne Collins.  Collin's makes this one of the best sequels I have read, it carries the story from beginning to end.<br /><br />The way the Districts and Capital play out is like the H.G. Well's short story \\"The Time Machine\\" whereas the Districts can be likened to the Morlocks, and the citizens of the Capital can be likened to the Eloi of that story. This is a time old story that's been repeatedly done but resonates so well with the world that we're living in right now.<br /><br />The dynamic of the characters in the story are great. Katniss is one of the protagonists that I'm drawn to with her emotions and inner thoughts, unlike other current young adult books. This was one of the problems I had heading into a series like these, but Collins does a wonderful job of creating a world where the characters are believable and their actions are realistic. Something that's refreshing to see in genre fiction.<br /><br />Collins' use of symbolism in the story carries over. I love the use of the Mockingjay pin as symbol for a silent rebellion. It draws the reader into the story, makes us sympathetic to Katniss, Peeta, as well as the districts and provides a mystery that carries from the beginning to the end of Catching Fire.<br /><br />One of the problems that I have with the Hunger Games as a whole is the fact that if the Districts and Capital are based in a future North America what happened to the rest of the world. If there are pockets of humanity still remaining in North America after an apocalyptic event, would there not be other pockets in the world as well? Wouldn't those pockets try to make contact with others, moreover would they help the districts gain their freedom? This is not fleshed out in first two books. I would have loved to have it mentioned at least in passing and been given some history on the state of the rest of the world.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a great book written by a good author, Suzanne Collins.

0736651454|4.0|I was kind of surprised, after reading this, to see all the negative reviews here...I gather that most people's biggest complaint about The Hammer of Eden is just that it is not The Pillars of the Earth.  I haven't read that yet---in fact, this is my first Follett novel---but I have read quite a few other thrillers of this type, and this one beats most of them hands down (way better than, for instance, Crichton's somewhat similar State of Fear).<br /><br />True, there are a few questionable plot points, but no worse than most (and not nearly as bad as many) thrillers of this kind.  And when I see people complaining about a lack of characterization, I wonder if we read the same book.  I found most of the characters quite interesting, and some even compelling, and found myself sympathizing with even some of the villains---which I would say is perhaps the book's biggest flaw, if it is a flaw at all.  The climax was a bit messy, the resolution not as satisfying as I would have liked, and the denouement in the final chapter a bit cliched (the obligatory brief statement of the fate of each character), but I enjoyed the ride on the way there.  Okay, so it's not a piece of great literature, but on the whole I thought this was a pretty decent thriller.

B007HJ9NBE|3.0|Well, for the most parts the movie was a remake of the first...same language, same hits, same songs.  There were a couple things that lost the movie for me....the scene in the warehouse with Wren dancing...the first one he was angry, but never vandalised anything.  He didn't have to here.<br /><br />As for the quality of the HD.  I have a great TV and downloaded this through Amazon HD, the movie was by no means HD.  If was hard to view, especially during anytime that there was a lot of motion....during a dance movie, that is a lot of the time.  It became almost pixalated, little blocks of pictures.  It never tracked to clear itself up but the viewing quality was more like ONE star.<br /><br />Makes me miss my DVD,
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|The beginning is tough to sit through since the movie seems like it's going to focus on the college kids the whole time.  The movie takes a turn once they introduce the \\"hillbillies\\" and you see they're good regular people.  After that, it's all laughs (some gruesome) between the feuding sides.  And if you like Alan Tudyk from Knight's Tale or Firefly, then give it a watch because he does a good job here.  No regrets here.  Watch!

B002ZG97LK|4.0|Nice blend of old Footloose into a contemporary milieu. iPod with beat up VW bug. Older sounds with contemporary sounds. Older dance with contemporary style dance. Acting was naturalistic and not overly pop Hollywood. Overall just nicely scripted. Suggest seeing the original first then this redux update.

B005LAIGOQ|2.0|After seeing the long running stage show I  was looking forward to seeing the film version. What a huge disappointment it was. It  was very slow moving and I was expecting some shocks in this ghost story. There were none. Beautifully photographed and acted. The mood was there but  it was missing any scenes that  should have make me  jump in my seat. One thing puzzled me is that when the leading character decides to spend a very long  day and night at the haunted mansion,all he takes is a little food that he is gven and  (it appears) nothing to drink.  You know there is no  drinkable water in the  deserted mansion. Also a dog is left to keep him company but no food or  water is provided for the dog. There was nothing  in this film at all that was original or scary.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|So, most people who only \\"just liked\\" Prayers for Rain or didn't enjoy it all are quick to say \\"It was no 'Gone Baby Gone'\\".  And they would be right...Prayers for Rain was actually better than 'Gone Baby Gone', in my opinion.  While Gone Baby Gone was good and slightly better of the Kenzie and Gennaro novels prior to it, I felt like it was a smidgen melodramatic.  For me, the Kenzie and Gennaro series are not only superb thrillers, there's also an underlying sense of humor that makes them great for me.  However, Gone Baby Gone was sort of short on the humor.  Prayers for the Rain adds a superb mystery and keeps the wit that the previous books in the series had.<br /><br />Not only did Prayers for Rain have the wit that the previous novels had, we also got more insight into Bubba.  He's always been one of my favorite characters and he has more of a role in this novel.  At first, Bubba was just an impulsive and criminal childhood friend of Patrick and Angie's who had a hard on for explosives, but in this one he serves more of a purpose.  You can actually see the love that these three characters have for each other.  Admittedly, that made me go \\"awww\\" and \\"tear\\", which is surprising when you consider how twisted and psychologically thrilling Prayers for Rain was.<br /><br />So, if you want to read a thrilling, witty, and superbly written (I mean, come on, it IS Dennis Lehane after all, so what else would you expect?) mystery (and overall) novel, definitely pick up Prayers For Rain.
1451648537|3.0|I am very surprised at Steve Jobs temperament and how demanding he could be with his associates. On the other hand he was a visionary thar could select good ideas and people for his products.  I think the book is well written with no punches held.
1441407855|4.0|There are very few iconic characters in fiction, but Sherlock Holmes may very well be the most iconic of all.  The mere mention of his name, even to those who've never seen a Holmes movie or read a Holmes book, is enough to evoke an image of the detective (most likely looking like Basil Rathbone, or more recently Robert Downey, Jr.).  Part of being an iconic character is he will transcend the work itself.  Like James Bond, another iconic character, the author or actor almost don't matter; if a particular story fails, it is the writer's fault, not the character's.<br /><br />The Hound of the Baskervilles is probably the most famous Holmes story, and though I'd seen a couple movie versions (one with Rathbone, one with Peter Cushing as Holmes), I'd never read the novel previously.  The tale focuses on the supposedly cursed family of the Baskervilles.  The family is wealthy enough, but tragedy and a mysterious monstrous dog fit into the Baskerville legend, a curse brought upon them for the actions of the vile Hugo Baskerville.<br /><br />After one more Baskerville is killed by the dog (or at least scared to death by it), Holmes and Watson are called in to protect the last Baskerville heir.  The completely practical Holmes refuses to believe in a supernatural explanation and will eventually find the much more mundane solution.<br /><br />As with most Holmes stories, the pleasure is in seeing Holmes in action.  But a little Holmes goes a long way, so Arthur Conan Doyle limits his presence in the story to maybe a third of the book.  If you read enough Holmes stories, the formulas Doyle uses become apparent, and they're in this tale too.  Nonetheless, this makes for either a nice introduction to Holmes, or for seasoned readers of earlier novels and short stories, one of Doyle's better efforts.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The combination of the music and the raindrops is wonderful, wish the music track was a little more diverse, but that is minor.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|Once upon a time, these people were pioneers and musicians.  Then they discovered \\"electronic music,\\" and, like ZZ Top, forgot that there was more than one groove or riff in the world, metaphorically speaking.  This album was the beginning of the end for me.  I miss the days when they would play these things called \\"instruments\\" and come up with creative ideas, like songs in 11/4 or having free jazz blaring over their tunes.  Now it's just as entertaining as watching somebody's kid brother play a video game you were only half interested in.

1603420398|5.0|I had some crochet experience when I decided to purchase this book. I love-love-love it. It is well written, it is clear, the images and figures are wonderful. The author uses both written instructions and diagrams. At the moment I have made my way through about half the book and have a bunch of circles and hexagons all over the place. I have learned how to do many new stitches. Of course, sometimes I have had to go to youtube to find a video to help me along, but I guess that is expected. If you like to crochet and want to learn more, this is your book. I think it would also make a great gift to any person that likes to crochet, as it will give them different and new ideas to work with.

0307276902|5.0|Frey uses a unique writing style that helps the reader see from his [past] raw, weary, substance-altered view. The story is fascinating and tragic, and not over-the-top; the characters are beautifully broken but not mellowdramatic. I could not put the book down. The sequel is just as good, if not better.<br />It's a shame the James Frey and his book(s) have gotten such a bad name just because Operah said so on TV. I'm not a fan and I didn't really want to hear about it, but apparently everyone got their panties up in a bunch because the story was not 100% true. WELL DUH. He didn't make up the whole thing, of course he embellished some details. Does it matter? Did people make some personal connection with the author? Is there some theory or meaning that is unforgivably voided if the story is not absolute truth? I'm pretty sure James Frey has gone through more than most of these inferior self-righteous critics. Open your eyes, he had to exaggerate in order to make the reader feel and have a CHANCE of understanding his trauma. All he had to work with was words on paper to describe a surreal personal account with inconceivable emotional repercussions to a jaded, unimpressed society. It's real enough.<br />This memoir is beautiful.

0143120530|4.0|I don't know why I  chose  Foer's book, and I'm certainly glad I did. Sure, it's full of interesting mneumonic techniques used throughout history and has a wacky cast of characters, but  it the author's voice and interaction with his subjects that make reading it captivating. I can't wait to read more about his adventures in future works.
B005FITIK0|4.0|Charlize Theron is a phenomenal actress and gives a captivating performance as Mavis - a sort of female Patrick Bateman without the violence, a product of the same \\"pursuit of loneliness\\".  But unlike the American Psycho, this character is somewhat unusual in that she is emotionally intelligent while being morally vapid and that complexity shows the brilliance of the writing.  Plenty of characters are intellectually vapid and morally vapid, or even intelligent but emotionally vapid and morally bankrupt like Patrick Bateman, but it's rare to see a character portrayed with such a high humanistic i.q. and so fatally foolish.  It's as if screenwriters can't imagine one of their own being such a source of dysfunction and a reminder that all the knowledge in the world will never take the place of heart.<br /><br />Good supporting cast, Wilson, who doesn't break new ground but serves the role, and Oswalt, who once again seems to play himself, not that that's bad, it seems to suit him best as his professional choice of comic requires him to craft his personality into something stage-worthy.  And not that it's a contrivance, but a dedication to connect with the truth of his real life \\"character\\" to the extent that it's possible to plug \\"Patton\\" into movies without having to create a new character, i.e., his stand up persona, his role in \\"Big Fan\\" and this role aren't different people, and he's entertaining in all three.<br /><br />Young Adult is the quintessential protagonist is more antagonistic than not, fatalistic yet enlightening, and evidence that Reitman and Cody are the go-to production team for dark-comedy dramas.  The dark is the spiritual doom, the comedy is the mesmerizing juxtaposition of realism and contrivance in a character walking around in an emotional coma where people who would help, can't reach her, and the drama is the intellectually and physically overgrown teenager dealing with emotionally young adult issues.<br /><br />The kitchen table scene is so good it's all time, and it's significance is indescribable, and in that, demonstrates the need for cinema.  Theron does more with facial expressions in that scene than some movie stars will achieve in their whole career, and represents what professionalism looks like when someone is at the top of their game as opposed to early career success or a big break.<br /><br />A note about black comedies - they are as hardcore as any movie and by digging at the core of existence they tend to be more severe than thrillers where the tone matches the content or horror movies, which are usually silly and/or nothing more than momentary shock and gore.  Black comedies usually don't elicit out loud laughs, but then, I never thought Carlin did either, and like Young Adult, he was amusing in a way that prompts you to muse, it's more of a food for thought and satisfying contemplation than an uncontrolled laugh and can be worth much more.  It is mislabeling in the sense that it's more irony than comedy, according to the definition - \\"situational irony - irony involving a situation in which actions have an effect that is opposite from what was intended, so that the outcome is contrary to what was expected.\\"  Mavis' intention is to be liked, but it's the young adult version of that, to be popular, and she gets the opposite of what she expected.  It worked then, everyone else moved on, grew up, and it doesn't work now, she alienates when her perverted intention was to gain acceptance.  The black of the comedy is that she's not adult enough to admit her need of others, to herself.<br /><br />Theron's performance is one of the more brilliant in recent memory along with Vera Farmiga in Higher Ground, Pitt in Moneyball, Shannon in Take Shelter and the entire cast of Animal Kingdom, all of whom give powerful performances without an ounce of over-acting.<br />Theron deserves an award for Young Adult more than she did for Monster.

031236198X|5.0|This is a very easy fast read with weeks of ongoing thought-provoking ideas.  We are in an era of huge changes - how do we deal with them and help our friends, family and co-workers do the same?  After reading this book, the process of how to begin taking the steps that will allow acceptance of what is happening is clearer.  I feel energized to be an instrument of positive thinking, not someone mired in fear of the future. I recommend it to anyone who works with groups, from businesses to no-profits, to neighborhood associations.  Our world is changing - we need to prepare now and make the provisions that will allow us to be alive and well and reasonably content with tomorrow.

0316036692|5.0|What a great book! It is an unusual look at the circumstances surrounding success. The author highlights some characteristics and circumstances that most people would never consider, no less associate. He comes to some rather astounding conclusions about people, their cultural backgrounds, and their ability to succeed. While it is a scientific truism that association does not prove causation, Gladwell makes a strong case for his hypotheses about successful people.

B006O99SYA|5.0|I read this book recently because I planned to attend the Adelaide, Australia, Writer's Week and knew Paul French, the author was to be one of the speakers.<br /><br />The book describes the details of the investigation carried out by the father of a young girl who was murdered in Peking in 1937. The police had failed to solve the murder.<br /><br />The author found the reports of the father's investigations which had been sent to England, stored away and forgotten since the late 1930's. The author must have spent many hours reading the reports, researching local Chinese history of the time and the characters in the story.<br /><br />Altogether, the book was fascinating to read as step by step the events  leading up to and of the actual crime were revealed.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Chinese history and real live murder mysteries.
B006ZZANDI|5.0|I really love this CD. It has a little bit of everything in there. Slow - fast - dance - etc. It really is amazing.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|When I think about this movie I am filled with a sense of inner conflict.<br /><br />On the one hand I am highly impressed with Meryl Streep's performance, for which she has at long last and deservedly won her third Academy Award after a 30 year gap, and after being nominated for the Academy Award a record seventeen times.<br /><br />Once every two years she is nominated for an Academy Award. Only Katharine Hepburn has more with four.<br /><br />Other directors have made movies about our leading political figures. Often these movies are not flattering portraits. Oliver Stone made a satirical comedy about G W Bush, which I found highly entertaining, somewhat of a caricature. Michael Moore made a far more scathing movie Fahrenheit 911. Then we have Primary Colors where where John Travolta played a played a Presidential candidate much like president Clinton. Stone also directed Nixon, a somewhat sympathetic picture of a character many regarded as villainous. Even though these portratits were not flattering you could detect some love or least amusement for the subject.<br /><br />Now with Iron Lady, we have a movie which defines its subject through the lens of disease, presumably Alzheimer's, although it never states the exact disease. The movie starts out promisingly enough with Thatcher, the grocers daughter, buying a bottle of milk, unrecognised and confused at a local grocery store.<br /><br />Streep conveys every nuance of Thatcher extremely well. The actor truly becomes the character, capturing, the tone, the accent, the gestures, the body language impeccably.<br /><br />What happens though, as you continue to watch, too much of the story is frittered away on depicting Thatcher as she is now, her disease, imaginary conversations with her long dead husband, living in the past, with occasional flashbacks, to the significant events of her political life, the romance with Denis, her rise to power, the various crises while she was in office, terrorist attacks, the Falklands War, the H Block protest, which escalated the tensions in Northern Irealnd, and so forth, and ultimately her fall from grace.<br /><br />I found this focus on defining the character by her disease extremely annoying and tiresome, and a huge mistake by the screenwriters to spend almost 50% of the time focusing on the disease while while forwarding through the significant events. The Falklands war is compressed to about five minutes. The H Block protests last about thirty seconds.<br /><br />I lived in the UK for the latter part of her leadership. Her insistence on an unpopular tax was the beginning of her downfall, and the cause of her being deposed as leader through the usual shenanigans. Here again we have very short treatment of what could have been great drama in favor of promoting the disease.<br /><br />When this movie was released several months ago in Argentina, it reportedly escalated tensions in Argentina. A journalist in the Falklands made an unflattering comment about the current female president. There were threats of invasion, and death threats against the journalist. It appears that she knows how to work the situation. Thankfully, this movie did not start a war.<br /><br />Iron Lady could have been a much better movie with a shift in focus away from the disease.<br /><br />Recently, I listened to an interview Streep did on the (NPR Fresh Air program), shortly before the Oscars. It was fascinating to learn how she puts together a character, and how she captured all those aspects of Thatcher's voice and rhetoric, the vocal coaching Thatcher underwent to moderate the strident early vocal style. How Thatcher had enormous lung power. People would wait for a break in breath to interrupt, but she would just keep going, much to their frustration. It discussed Streep's entire career. It was extremely well researched. Catch it if you can.<br /><br />I think most people will appreciate Streep's performance, but probably will not like the movie overall. I will not watch this movie again. I hope that future screenwriters and directors will have more sympathy and sensitivity for their subject than this.<br /><br />If not for Streep's performance this would be a one star review. Her longtime hairstylist also won an Oscar for this movie.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful.r their subject than this.  If not for Streep's performance this would be a one star review.

B003HE2B6C|5.0|I loved Hanson when I was a young pre-teen and recently heard this album by accident while surfing for new music, and I've rekindled my love of Hanson as a result.

B004LWZW8I|2.0|There seems to be a disturbing trend in movie making of darkening the film until it becomes literally hard to see.  This is one of the worse examples (we've almost seen) of that in the last few years.<br /><br />I had to turn the brightness up on a 61\\" display that was called \\"so bright it can be seen from space\\" in a professional magazine reviewer's opinion, so the TV is not the issue.<br /><br />This darkening trend is infecting many studios and the people responsible for the final appearance of their films.  If you look in the special features, you will find some deleted scenes that were not included in the final processing and are much brighter, easily seen and clear.<br /><br />This darkening is being carried too far and hurting the final product.  We wonder if there is a reason for this other than Hollywood sheep following a bad trend.  Less detail is possible; mistakes can be covered up, bad photography hidden.....<br /><br />This movie had some fair action but comes up short on entertainment which was lost in the dark.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|FANTASTIC BOOK! I read the other two and had to buy this one. It is a great story with sudden twists and turns. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. The ending was a little sudden. I wanted it to keep going and going. But every book has to come to an end. If you have read the other two you must read it. It is a great story written well by a great author.

B0047Y17P2|5.0|Very often in Connelly's novels, we are presented with professional, social, psychological and romantic parts of his heroes lifes. This makes for the interest one finds reading them. This time in \\"The Fifth Witness\\" there is even one more side of the intrigue we can read about and this is the financial crisis that a lot of us have been confronted to but have not always suspected that so many lawyers and justice courts have been deeply involved in.<br /><br />Meanwhile two important elements that seem to possibly occur soon at the end ot the novel, namely a new carreer as D.A. and his reconciling with his ex-wife could prompt Michael Connelly to write sequels for \\"The Fifth Witness\\".<br /><br />In a word, a very interesting novel.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|This was a great read. I could not put it down. There are lots of twists and turns and surprises. Best one of his books so far, that I have read!
B002BWP49C|1.0|The movie was not an enjoyable experience for me. I could not follow the plot. So many speed bumps and detours. The other twilight movies carried me, they flowed with true thirst quenching heroic tales of passion,action,and romance. This movie just did not do it for me.It was just so disappointing. Its like waking up one day and finding out that your wife is cheating on you. I was a fan and now I am not. I have lost that loving feeling.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I really do not get why people can write such terrible reviews about such a good series. Honestly, these are some of the best books i have ever read. In this one though, she didn't make the games have enough suspense as the first. Pretty much the whole time during the games is &#34;Let's walk around killing everyone we see! yay! i'm never going to die because i'm awesome enough!&#34;... I really think that the first was the better book and this book should only really be read if you want to face the sadness and complete randomness of Mockingjay.

B005DF2QMC|5.0|You could pay more for a product similar to this but the tech support was outstanding. When you are having a problem with most other companies  good luck. Called this tech support and he got into my computer and had me watch how he set everything while talking to him at the same time. If you call and it goes to voice mail it's just a matter of minutes until he calls you back. With the instructions on all of the products I've looked at it wouldn't be easy to figure out, but doing it this way made it so very easy and the product works just as well as advertised. I would certainly recommend this to any one to transfer from tape to computer. Also the software provided has an option to let you record from Youtube or anything coming through your computer which is a plus.

7115142343|5.0|Saw this movie for the third time , and understood its greatness. I won't go over the details of the movie, others have done that, just add my observations. It was about the question \\"Is The Pen Mightier Than The Sword?\\" and as the song later says \\" The Man who shot Liberty Valence was the bravest of them all.\\" In other words what constitutes bravery. Well some notable scenes for the pen vs sword controvery intended by the author. The scene where steward as the elected official and school teacher , has the masses and protection of the majority of the town and the towns folk always helping him and looking to him for leadership. We have the other person, John Wayne who used and claimed the sword , end up self destructing. So its not the gun that's bad philosophy but how you use it and who is pulling the trigger in the end that matters. Yet, it was the sword in the end that changed the history and let the pen accomplish its feats, When John Wayne killed Liberty Valence. We also have the question of what is bravery so well demonstrated in this movie. Jimmy Stuart might not have killed Liberty Valence, but was brave in standing up to him even if not armed well. In contrast, even though John Wayne used a \\"trick\\" to kill Valence (standing in the dark with a bigger gun... a rifle) he in the end was the brave one - not because as the song later says he shot Liberty Valence (that was the stuff of legends) rather because he gave up the thing he loved most because he loved his girl. If he did not save Jimmy Steward, he would have been Very Miles Husband. Wow, what a great movie with so many statements being made about human nature. This, The Searchers, and Horse Soldiers, are my favorite John Wayne movies. This for the message, The Searchers for the beauty and story, and Horse Soldiers for the pure adventure.

The buttons on the top allow you to change the sensitivity to 3 different settings that you can set in the program.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great mouse, and I would recommend it to anyone who needs one.

0399159029|4.0|This Bernie Gunther is a departure from the run of the last several books, which featured several plot lines, numerous flashbacks and flashforwards.  This book is a straightforward narrative of several days in 1941 and a few from 1942, the story is told in a linear and simple way, and the plot, while well-conceived, is very much simpler in scope and imagining than in most if not all of the previous Gunther novels.<br /><br />In fact, it's Kerr's attempt to write an Agatha Christie-like murder mystery, pure and simple.  (Not only is Christie mentioned at least three times, Kerr utilizes - with acknowledgement - a major plot device from one of the better Christie books as well.)  It's still WWII, the characters are all Nazis of greater or lesser malevolence, and the atmosphere is still very well imagined and portrayed, but what we have here is Bernie solving a murder with a limited list of characters, in a country castle, going through interrogations, multiple potential motives and means, a Christie-like unmasking of the who-where- and how.  It's not bad, but it's somewhat different.<br /><br />Bernie finds himself outside of Prague, unexpected guest of Reinhard Heydrich, and surrounded by various SS Generals and factotums of differing degrees of repellent characters.  Heydrich is concerned about his own security...snd the next thing one knows, it is not he but one of his four aides who has been shot dead.  He is found in a room locked from the inside, in a bizarre state of undress, pills by his side, and with no obvious way of having been so murdered.  Gunther deals with each of the rich cast of murderers as to whether or not they have murdered this man, and his interactions with the others is where the book excels.  Of course, there's also a girl involved, subplots concerning the Czech resistance, homosexuality in the SS, and so on, all part or not part of the murder mystery.<br /><br />However, I regret to report that the very noirish, wise-cracking and often very,very funny Gunther from the first three novels has been watered down over the last several novels to the point where his character has become more morose, less interesting, and just less fun.  Obvisouly maintaining the very high standard of writing excellence and originality of the Berlin Noir trilogy would challenge the very best novelists - to which I think Kerr belongs - but it is nonetheless sad to see this relative deterioration.<br /><br />That said, as historical fiction Kerr as always gets the details very right, can write some great scenes, and of course has a great cast of characters to move around onstage, and Gunther's moral ambiguity as he stumbles through his benighted world makes for satisfying reading.  If you have enjoyed this series, you will likely also enjoy this entry, departure from the usual that it is.

1419702238|5.0|Jeff Kinney has done it again. He has written and drawn another bestseller. In Cabin Fever, Greg is up to his usual antics, but the story is set up in such a way that readers have a rare opportunity to delve more deeply into Kinney's nuanced protagonist. Kinney's ability to realistically capture the art of storytelling from a kid's perspective is one of many reasons why all of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books are so addicting. Greg is wimpy, selfish, (kind of) mean, and narrow-minded--traits that shout out \\"AUTHENTICITY!\\" to Kinney's loyal preteen readers. People enjoy reading about Greg, a run-of-the-mill kid who is a just a tad too sharp for his own good. A far cry from a Mary Sue or a rebellious preteen flipping off the world, Greg is instead the kid who will beg his mom for extra time and money to provide for a digital pet, whine that the world isn't fair, sneak a peak (and some more) at his Christmas presents before the big day... and so on.<br /><br />In Cabin Fever, Kinney revisits all of the tried-and-true character traits responsible for skyrocketing this series to popularity. But this time around, Kinney doesn't stop there. Cabin Fever takes Greg's antics to the next level; Greg gets in over his head and has a run-in with the authorities. Unsurprisingly, everything happily works out in the end, but what makes Cabin Fever so memorable is how the story line offers readers a chance to see that Greg, for all of his silly, trouble-inducing antics and motivations, is really a good kid at heart.<br /><br />If you want to understand Greg--or rather, if you want to understand children--set aside the parenting magazines for the time being, and pick up this book. The way Jeff Kinney describes Greg Heffley is spot on for how it is with most kids, from the do-gooders to the trouble-makers. Cabin Fever once again reminds us why, despite all of the duplicate graphic novels out there trying to copy Kinney's style, Kinney remains the original bestseller. Cabin Fever had me lauging out loud from Page One. I highly recommend it to kids everywhere. For those grown-ups who can't be caught dead buying and reading a kid's book, I hope you have a sibling or child from whom you can bum the book off of because Cabin Fever is a MUST READ.

159562015X|1.0|While I spent comparatively little for this copy, I'm angry now that I spent anything on it at all.  I feel as if I've been suckered into a scam.<br /><br />I bought this book hoping it would be useful in helping my teenagers determine their personal strengths, so they might use that knowledge when making decisions about both their future education and careers.  What a waste of time and money.<br /><br />The book is nothing but discussion of the online test and a list defining each of the 34 supposed themes. It came with only ONE code for taking that online test.<br /><br />I took the test myself, just to try it out, only then to discover that no one else could use that one code.  There's no way to add other profiles to your account.  If I wanted my kids to take the test, I'd have to shell out more money and buy copies of the book for each of them.  Are you kidding me?  Why on earth would I want multiple copies of this nigh-useless book lying around?<br /><br />Moreover, the test itself was exceedingly non-specific, the supposed strengths listed were just generic overviews of broad personality traits, and the \\"Ideas for Action\\" it offered were really quite vague.  For example:<br /><br />\\"Wise forethought can remove obstacles before they appear.\\"<br /><br />\\"Trust your insights, and use them to ensure the success of your efforts.\\"<br /><br />\\"Find people who like to talk about the same issues you do. Organize a discussion group<br />that addresses your subjects of interest.\\"<br /><br />Honestly, I've gotten more personal insight from fortune cookies.

1400052181|4.0|This is a fascinating tale, and a great book to discuss. Henrietta Lacks was born in Central Virginia in 1920 and died in Baltimore, when she was 31, leaving behind a husband and 5 children. What she didn't know she left behind were pieces of the tumor her doctor removed that were then shared with another doctor, who cultivated them and - voila - HeLa cells were discovered. (If you've never heard of HeLa, ask anyone you know in the medical profession ... anyone.)<br /><br />The piece is an undertaking by a previously unknown author, who spent years and her student-loan money to research and write this story. It is also a sad footnote in history of what happens when society turns its back on a segment of the population, how they survive just beyond our line of sight - unknown, unrecognizable to us - until we are forced to take a look. Skloot forces us to look, and what she shows us isn't always pretty.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|I read \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" some twenty years ago. I don't recall all the details of the book, but I remember it being a beguiling novel (though I think that John Le Carre has written better books, like for instance, its sequel \\"The Honourable Schoolboy\\"). The book is basically about taciturn spy George Smiley being brought back from retirement in order to catch a mole set by his Soviet nemesis, Karla, in the Circus (an alter ego for MI6, the British Intelligence Service). Now comes a film version of the novel, that roughly respects the plot (in 1979, there was a miniseries about the book, starring Alec Guiness as Smiley, which I haven't seen). The recreation of the era (the early 1970s) is fine, but this is one of the few positive things that I can say about this movie.<br /><br />First, in this movie, Smiley is performed by Gary Oldman, almost unrecognizable under loads of old age makeup (wouldn't it have made more sense to hire an older actor to play Smiley?).<br /><br />Second, the movie is at times dull and boring and its tone is ridiculously somber.<br /><br />Third, almost all the actors here perform languidly, as if they were making a parody of a British gentleman. Now, the cast includes many famous British actors (aside Oldman, we have Colin Firth, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, and many others that are lesser known). These actors are usually fine performers in other movies, so clearly the filmmakers are at fault here.<br /><br />Fourth, the plot is virtually impossible to follow if you haven't read the book (understandably so, considering six hours of the miniseries have been compressed to two hours).<br /><br />Worst of all, the climactic scene when the mole is finally caught (for obvious reasons, I'm not going to say who he is) is, well, totally anticlimactic, to the point where the audience might felt cheated, after all the previous buildup (by the way, it is interesting to see that when the traitor is find, he is initially treated withkids gloves, as if never forgetting that while he might be a Soviet spy, he hasn't stopped being a gentleman. So, in a way, this movie suggests that postwar Britain might have not been very well suited to the ruthless game of international espionage).<br /><br />So, summing up, a great disappointment, a movie that despite high expectations and high critical acclaim has in my opinion little to recommend for it.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Huge FAN of the show and always have LOVED the music played on the show, this CD does not dissapoint, Rockin versions of songs.  Wish the Irish version of the Theme Song would have been on here is my only bummer...And \\"Strange Fruit\\" cover is INCREDIBLE!!
0439023513|3.0|For this to be the final book I really wanted it to be better.<br /><br />The Hunger Games and Catching Fire both had me on edge. I couldn't stop reading and felt like I was in the story. Mockingjay lacked the same luster that the first two books had.<br /><br />I kinda felt like the book was rushed.  Let's face it we could have gone with a more pages if it would have told the story better.  I think her decision between Gale and Peeta could have been played better. It was almost like we waited the whole book just to get a summary of why she ends up with who she is with.  I felt like summaries were used a lot in this book. Things that could have been actually explained were just like \\"And she woke up and all these things have happened.\\"<br /><br />I really think she could have played on the Peeta/Hijacking story better, oh that had so much potential but again it left me with this \\"really? is that it\\" feeling.<br /><br />Hey we read an 800 Harry Potter book, we could have done the same if that is what it would have taken to make this book as good as the first two.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is the best game ever it has everything u would want u have to think and it stops boredum
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a book about the effect of war on kids. The reviewers who did not like this book, really could not relate to the plot or the main character, Katniss.  The plot is brutal and the character is at times very mature, and at other times, selfish and childish.  The negative reviews touched on the stories implausible points, such as 1. the games themselves and how \\"parents would not stand for it.\\" 2. the main characters only slight reaction to killings she instigates, and 3. the main character's being unlikable, distant and selfish.<br /><br />  Katniss disconnects her emotions early, when she must be a parent to her parent. When she must avert starvation for her family.  That early abuse leads to her doing everything she can for survival, including a disconnect of her conscience as she must kill or be killed.  It also leads to her disfunctional romantic relationships, as well as her erratic behavior. She is survival itself. She is constantly confused as to if she is a child or an adult, the line blurs. I believe the author does not want you to like her, but understand the terrible, irreversible effects of war on children. How it removes their childhood and makes them into emotionless, disconnected individuals.<br /><br />Katniss's childhood is taken away, she buries her feelings deep down, and is basically very very screwed up.  It is the authors' intent to show that terrible effect war has: robbing Katniss of her childhood, family, emotions, identity and choices. If she reacts to each killing, she must connect them to her emotions and risk completely going mad.  There is only so much a child's brain can take. She regresses occasionally, only because she did not fully experience her childhood.<br /><br />As for the \\"parents not standing for the games,\\" I believe they would if controlled by fear. History is full of genocides and terrible atrocities where people turned a blind eye.  Fear is a powerful motive.<br />This is a well written fantasy.  It hasa purpose of showing the terrible effects of how fear controls and how war destroys all people. Young adult fiction, but I enjoyed these books. Recommended.

B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I grew up in the 60's/70s, and my tastes in music tend to the rock classics (Beatles, Doors, Moody Blues, Stones, Dylan, Hendrix), as well as jazz, blues, R&B, classic country (Johnny, George, Willie, Patsy, etc.), folk, classical. Just about anything but (with exceptions) most modern mainsteam pop/R&B/hip-hop/rap.<br /><br />This album, though, really stands out among pop music albums of recent vintage in the quality of the songwriting. If you like mellow pop music with great hooks, listen to this album, especially \\"Blue Jeans\\", \\"National Treasure\\", \\"Radio\\", \\"Born to Die\\". Really, the entire album is excellent.<br /><br />Heartily recommended.

0060555661|5.0|HI all this is my first review on a book ever, my review is oriented to the beginner audience. This book is a must have as a book NOT e-book why because its a practical book. It teach you the Psychological aspect of investing in the \\"market\\", what a company really worth \\"intrinsic value\\" although don't expect mathematical equations on a step by step basis, he will give you the concept behind and how to get there. The book is very long and I highly recommend having a notebook with you, or make a lot of marking on the book like I did. For me the most important part of this book and a point that Graham stress a long the book is that YOU DO NOT  need a PhD from harvard in economy or even a bachelor degree to invest in the market, or need to be a millionaire to invest, ordinary people can. Because is a matter of character NOT IQ. Of course, if you are ordinary you will need more book to get basic knowledge of other aspect of investing. Jason on the other hand bring the book to a more update version,  I don't like his comments to much but I think is vital to compare what Graham experience on 1949 vs 2000's markets. My recommendation is that you buy first this same book but the original version of 1949, \\" The Intelligent Investor, The classic text on value investing\\" is feature by John C Bogle. Is very different from this new version and more concept oriented. Bottom line the book is worth it as long as you have the other copy too. Enjoy the book.....

B005OTGS4E|3.0|This movie was a bit disappointing actually.  I just BARELY give it 3 stars.  The acting was pretty good, but the story was just so-so and I can't say I got invested in any of the characters.  Even when there were in a pins and needles life or death situation, I was not on the edge of my seat holding my breath and willing them on etc.  It simply fell flat and bordered on boring. ...it's not a movie you'd \\"hate\\" but I sincerely doubt it will be one you'll be really glad you saw and want to recommend to friends.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is awesome for studying the Bible. Tons of translations that can be downloaded to take offline, Bible studies for many subjects and much more.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is wonderful to be able to carry more than one book in my bag!  I am an avid reader and I like to pull a book out and read whenever the opportunity arises, so the Amazon Kindle is perfect.  I love it and the number of books available to buy (and some are free!) is fantastic.  I highly recommend the Amazon Kindle.
1594203334|5.0|This was a great book even for a person that is not married or have children; although I am huge Francophile. It was beautifully written with special care not to say that the American way of raising children is wrong and also that France's way is not overly strict or cold. She does a great balance of intergrating these views and presenting good research, with equally interesting stories and experiences. I also like that she did not suger coat how challenging it is to raise children, let alone in foreign country where she is not fluent in French. Her writing is cohesive and easy to read. I do hope she writes another book. I have evened read some of the chapter more than once. I told friends about this book, i am hoping we can adopt some of these ideas, especially when it comes to food and sleeping. I cannot believe that in this country so many children eat the worst diets, ever. In France and Italy this is unheard of - it's the families that make good eating a priority...and getting their children to sleep at a certain time every night without making deals with them!<br />This is what the French parents call \\"Eduation\\" in the sense you are teaching children about life and each of these lessons are teaching confidence, self-assurance and independce; making for a great adult and a good citizen.
B005ER6SNM|1.0|WARNING SLIGHT SPOILERS.......I Personally love this film and was sent the uncut screener a couple years ago when the film was first released and was completely blown away, from the acting which is top notch to the special effects and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, so i ordered the american release of the film with no intentions of it being cut and being its the u.s there was never a film that had any problems being distributed because of content. Apon first inspection of the film i noticed every controversial scene was cut and the film itself Completely lost its power and totally underlined the point the director was trying to make.The scenes in which are cut are the infamous \\"newborn scene\\" and the ending which the two hooded victims are unveiled also the tooth extraction suffication is also cut. If you are a fan of extreme horror films I can not stress enough to avoid the invincible pictures/ u.s release and go for the 100% uncut swedish dvd or the holland release even without eng. subtitles, its better than watching a \\"Mickey Mouse version\\" of a beautiful piece of exploitation cinema.
B000002VMD|5.0|Just like the movie this is the best and most beautiful soundtrack and even more special since the passing of Whitney Houston.  Rest in Peace my dear.
B003Y5H4Y8|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie - but I have to say I was disappointed.<br /><br />I was expecting much more excitement, but there was very little of that.  Helen Mirren's character is fairly dull and reserved and even boring.  I'm not sure if it's the story or the acting/directing that fell thru the cracks here, but the movie overall just didn't cut it.  I would not recommend this.<br /><br />[I even watched it a 2nd time to see if perhaps I didn't like it the first because I had too high of expectations for it...but it was still borderline boring with a few tense scenes - just not worth it]
B004P4S4NM|5.0|This album is incredible; if you liked 19, you will LOVE this album. Great voice, great style and interpretation of music, great lyrics- couldn't ask for more.

B007JRU2UK|4.0|This movie was slow-moving at times, but overall a very REALISTIC portrayal of the emotions and actions during a serious tragedy.  This was a very good movie & would recommend it.  Good acting by George Clooney & the oldest daughter!
0761169253|5.0|Your job is to collect new ideas from everywhere you can: internet, movies, blogs, art,etc...<br />that's the basic message of this book. This book is also created so that it does not look like a conventional chapter book for adults, and therefore, its format also supports the message that the author wants to share with his readers: Nothing is original. Steal!<br /><br />This book was great to read and I finished it almost immediately after the purchase. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for something to boost their brains and to be more creative in their lives and thinking.
B005NQ94LM|3.0|This was a beautiful movie and yet I will never watch it again. It was like watching a train wreck. You know, you see it coming and yet you still keep watching! They ended as if something was not finished. To realistic and painful for me and yet beautiful all at the same time. Are you confused yet? Goodness knows I am.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, every time I did I kept thinking about it, the relationship between the main characters is so real and the story is just so beautiful, it makes you think and value what you have. This is a must read book!
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|I hesitate to review this film, as reactions to reviews on this site are becoming increasingly hostile. If you liked this movie and are offended by an individul who did not, then please refrain from reading any review that is rated less than 5-stars.<br />I didn't enjoy this film for a number of reasons. First, is Hollywood's insistence on portraying teenagers as thoroughly unlikable and disrespectful. I found it irritating that George Clooney's character allowed his daughters to use the f-word, refer to eachother as \\"motherless whores\\", \\"twats\\", etc. and basically carry on like deliquents.<br />This is typical Hollywood: all teenagers are mouthy little twerps and the parents sigh, and seem incapable of behaving like actual adults. Instead, they are portrayed as harrassed, weary, and impotent.<br />The viewer is led to assume that the father has been absent for much of his childrens' lives. Oddly, though, he never seems to work once his wife becomes comatose. Where did his work load go? What happened to his legal cases? No matter, we're not supposed to wonder about that. We're also not supposed to feel incredulous when George Clooney's character allows his daughter's moronic and rude boy friend to tag along on the family's journeys. We're also not to question why a husband, who is about to lose his wife and mother to his children, would spend so much time tracking down her former lover. To what end? For what purpose? I like George Clooney, but his character in this film is flat and one-dimensional. Finally, the extras in this film are so bad, delivering their lines in a dead-pan, amaterish way that reminded one of watching high-school performances. But that's just my opinion!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Amazing. Just amazing. Rick Riordan seems to be a son of Athena himself, with his creative, fun, and sometimes funny way of writing books. And coming from a fan who has read all of his demigod adventures, I think that this was his best creation. I loved it from the start. Who couldnt? If you read the Lost Hero, then you will be pulled into this book at the beginning. Percy Jackson, missing camper from Camp Half Blood, is thought to be dead. Even the ones he has loved the most think he is gone. But Percy doesnt lnow that. His memory is gone! And there is more. Desperatly trying to find your place in life is already not easy without a memory of your past, but being trailed by monsters who dont seem to die and stay dead no matter how many times you reduce them to a pile of ash? He eventually stumbles upon a godess who gives him a start at a new camp for children of Roman gods called Camp Jupider. For some reason, everybody around him is staying away. Percy finds two nice kids, Hazel, dauter of Pluto, and Frank, son of Mars. Well, in Percy's somewhat uncomfterable few days in Camp Jupider, he manged to get himself into a quest, and bringing Hazel and Frank with him, Percy sets off, and experiences: relizing the truth behind his life, finding out that his two friends should be dead, being told that Frank's life depends on a burned up stick and Hazel has some sort of curse that brings evil riches above the surface of the earth, fighting two giants that are the size of a building and wont die, fending off an army of cannibals that have exploding cannonballandwant to eat Frank, sommoning a zombie warrior, threatening wheat germ, and all while Frank tries to learn his family power, which he knows nothing about. I promise that this book will captivate your brain completely, and you will end up in a situation like mine where you find yourself up untill midnight soaking up all of the greatness that Rick Riordan pours over every page of all of his books.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a really cool app to play when you are bored or anytime you have time. I really like the music in the background it gives it that zen feeling. Only thing it needs is more levels. I'm almost out!
B001KEHAI0|5.0|Este film es un clasico y plantea con mucho humor la posibilidad de considerar que harias si tuvieses la posibilidad de hacer de manera diferente lo que has hecho.<br />Recomendable!
B007H7XJD4|4.0|Definitely a 4 star movie in my opinion. The story is solid, the acting is great, and the action scenes are exciting. Visually, it has a style similar to 300. I think this style gives the movie a dreamlike effect, but yet still stays grounded, and makes good use of the various settings the characters are in.<br /><br />As for the negative reviews...I'm REALLY surprised. Regarding the story, it clarifies early in the movie that the gods can be killed (even though they are crazy powerful compared to a regular human). Looks like some reviewers expected invulnerable gods, or perhaps behemoth titans like from \\"Clash of the Titans\\" (there aren't any gigantic monsters or heroes in this film).<br /><br />Bottom line, in my opinion, easily a 4 star movie.

B005UBNKZG|4.0|I bought this first because I was waiting on the black edition. I did have trouble installing it on a AM3+ motherboard because the bios needed to be updated. So I used my 1100T to update it and got it to work very well. So far it is running flawlessly for over 6 months with no problem. I bought the black edition and you can see a big difference in compatibility and overclocking compare to this CPU but don't get me wrong this processor is excellent for it's price.<br /><br />The black edition is 20 bucks more right now and I bought it. I now have two systems for gaming, overclocking while using this CPU as for graphic and video rendering. I seen a major difference from a Phenom II 4 core. There is at least a 10-15% performance increase from my 6 core 1100T but overall it is a good CPU.<br /><br />Remember to update your bios with your old AMD processor if you find a older motherboard that hasn't had a bios update. This will fix the problem. If you are able to post on boot up but not have all cores activated, get the bio's flashed and updated then you are good to go.<br /><br />Overall this processor is good but you be better off getting the black edition for 20 bucks more which is well worth it. You will not have issues with the black edition of this CPU.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|I 1st read SPY when it came out in 1964.  A few weeks earlier I had seen the 1st James Bond film.  The SPY was such a relief, and an overwhelming enjoyment.  This was what real intelligence officers were like.  No bikini models on a beach. I have reread the novel over the years.  Each time, I have enjoyed it even more.  If you have not read a Call For the Dead, I would urge you to do so.  I think it is the first Smiley novel<br />bob
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|Where have you seen this plot before?  Nowhere!  Add on top of this the clear, underated, acting \\"talents\\" of Matt Damon, and you truly have a 4.5 to 5.0 movie.  If you are tired of 23 versions of a sci-fi like Transformers I, II, III, etc. (great movies in their own right) and want a touch more finese than in your face acting - this movie is for  you.<br />Matt Damon is probably one of THE most under-ratedd talents in Hollywood in his era - Ben Affleck - this goof rides on the coat tails of a total cast - he is NOTHING on his own and his own development of a character.  Ben Stiller -- come on --- he steps into roles that say \\"insert homogenous, actor of the moment, roles that he is okay in - but where is the style?  The finese?  Put enough marketing dollars behind any movie and it will at least \\"show\\" on the ratings.....Matt Damon seems to be set apart - he actually can DEVELOP a character out of an ordinary script.<br />Matt Damon IS of the ilk of Woody Allen or Jeff Bridges....Jude Law plays a strong role in this film as well.  This is one of THE most-missed movies of the very late 1990's (1999).<br />There can be a happy medium behind the fantasy, sci-fi world of Harry Potter, et al, and the hugely dramatic and over acted roles, played most lately by Sir Anthony Hopkins....<br />This IS a movie to watch...the cinematography is beautiful in this film.<br /><br />Wonderful film.....fantastic pacing and development..
0783114893|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Tired eyed Jim Halsey decides to pick up a hitchhiker to keep him company. It turns out to be the biggest mistake of his life when the hitcher turns out to be John Rider, a deranged sociopath whose been murdering random strangers up and down the highway, now Jim must survive John's deadly game.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />`The Hitcher' is a take no prisoners road movie thriller packed with urban legends. The first ten minutes fools us into thinking we are in for a straight up psychological horror, it quickly becomes clear that action will take center stage. Rutger Hauer is truly menacing here, no other actor can play a soulless villain quite like he can; those eyes are ice cold. The fact that Ryder kills with no motive bothered some critics, to me this mystery makes Rider even more terrifying. `The Hitcher' is unapologetic and that is what i like about it; love or hate it, take it for what it is.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The opening scene is scary as hell; you will never pick up a hitchhiker again!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />C. Thomas Howell admitted that he was actually scared of Rutger Hauer on and off the set because of the actor's intensity.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is my 2nd copy of the soundtrack. A soothing and memorable musical piece. A classic by John Williams. A must have by all Harry Potter fans.
0385534639|3.0|I kept reading and reading waiting for the part where I would say \\"Ah yes, this is why there are so many 5 star ratings and such a high overall star rating for this book, it really is magical.\\".....  Well um.....  It never happened.  It was mildly entertaining at best.  I have learned from reading all of the reviews and being excited about reading this book that not everyone likes the same foods, the same drinks, the same books.  I am still surprised that it has such a high rating.  To each their own.  Makes me wonder just what kinds of books hold the 5 star raters attention normally?  I didn't find it magical in the least albeit it was interesting.  Worth a read?  Hard to say...  I have so many other books stacked up that might warrant a 4 or 5 star rating.  I typically don't read books that only earn 3 stars but maybe now I should rethink this way of reading....  Normally it works well but this time it certainly wasn't a MAGICAL READ for me.  This one was merely a 3 star, no more!
B00701897I|5.0|At first I was worried that my Digital Copy Code wouldn't work, but it's terrifically wonderful! I can access on iTunes, Windows Media Player, Amazon Instant Video, and VuDu! I'm downloadling only 3 out of 4 just incase either one of them don't work for downloading Tintin, But would that take more of my free space? ((like someone to tell me please?))<br />overall I'm so happy to show with friends and family members~ I get to enjoy watching this whereever I go or how far I am!! and Introduce more people to this Movie!

B000VUCIZO|3.0|I read iWoz just after the Steve Jobs biography, which I enjoyed reading very much. I must say that iWoz, though not as interesting a read, it was a good change of pace and definitely the nicer of the 2 Steves.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Mystery, love, war, witches and vampires and all the 'other-worldly' creatures!  This book has em!  It is a very long read, with lots of history mixed in.<br />Definitely my kind of book!  You know it's a great book when you can't put it down at night, and when you finally HAVE to sleep, when you wake up you<br />find yourself still a little lost in the real world!  I found myself thinking of the characters throughout the day!  I can't wait to read more books from this<br />author!  A very entertaining read, for sure!
1469984202|5.0|I don't give out very many five-star ratings. This book deserves five stars and more.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it was carefully edited -- if there were grammar or spelling errors, I didn't notice them (I'm a bit of a nitpicker about this). The ebook was formatted properly, no weird breaks, no missing sections -- refreshing for an indie book. So reading the book was an unmarred pleasure.<br /><br />And then there is the story. I'd originally purchased the first story when my husband showed me a recommendation on Boing Boing. It grabbed me from the first paragraph. I became an observer in the world of the Silo, and I cared what happened to every character, and I wanted to know why certain events happened. As soon as I finished, I went for Wool Omnibus -- I could've borrowed it as a Prime member, but I believe good writers should be paid for their work and I want to support this author, so I paid the five bucks for it. I don't regret a penny of it.<br /><br />What interested me from the beginning is the role of IT in their world, versus all of the other systems necessary to keeping the Silo going. The same as the role IT takes in corporations and organizations now, where if they're allowed to, the administrators have a warped sense of the \\"common good\\" and can be overreaching and arrogant and actually work against the mission of the corporation or organization. I don't know if Howey wrote it as a warning -- maybe. It's not that it's anti-technology -- not at all. It's just that systems are all essential and no one system should be dominant at the expense of other systems. Interesting sociology.<br /><br />What I noticed about this book is I thought about it a lot when I wasn't reading, and I'm noticing more about how systems actually work in the real world.<br /><br />The five stories were a satisfying read, and it ended at a good point. But I want to read more; I want to know what happens next and about, well, I won't say what else because I don'twant to include any spoilers.
B005UKKDAC|5.0|If you like Kevin James and Adam Sandler like I do, you will love this movie!  Make sure to watch it in HD so the animation pops.
B001992NUQ|5.0|I recommend that everybody watch this movie at least once. Some are going to like it, some are going to hate it. But to me, it is an awesome story. Im not going to say it made me think deeply but it did make me wonder how I didnt see it coming.

B0078N2MTE|1.0|I thought this would be an entertaining post apocalyptic thriller, but instead far too much time is spent with the hero thinking he's going crazy, visiting his schizophrenic mom, and developing the small folksy hometown feel of this small Ohio town. I watched 45 minutes and all that happened is the hero had a few bad dreams. I fast forwarded to the end to find out how it all ended, but I was disappointed.<br /><br />I thought the film was atmospheric, and I liked the characters and if there was a sequel which might explain what happened next, I could've gone for it, but far too much buildup for me not to want to see the payload which is barely touched on in the last few minutes of the show.<br /><br />I was disappointed.
0763655465|5.0|I loved this book.  It has a subtle message that kids will understand told thru the world of a dog.  If you know dogs, unless they are well trained, they are not the most self controlled creatures-especially with food!  George's opening cake distraction is both endearing and factual!  And it will make parents and kids both laugh.  The message for kids is that you CAN maintain self control-if you try hard enough-like George!!  :)
B0052VUNHC|4.0|i loved this book. i hated this book. the whole time i read it i was screaming at them. i felt like i was living through it with them. this is not your typical boys meets girl story.there is a lot of fighting and crying and emotions run very high throughout the entire book. i couldnt put it down. if you love bad boys you will love travis. unless you like a whole lot of drama i dont recommend this book but if you want to go on a roller coaster ride of a relationship with a bad boy that falls in love and the girl who turns his world upside down then this is the book for you.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was a very thrilling book to end the trilogy. Although it was only plainly about the assassination of Coin and Snow, it was still really nice. There should have been a next book with a story of the future of Katniss. Two thumbs up! :))
0062082353|4.0|Based on the \\"Most Lethal Sniper\\" advertisement on the slipcover of the book, I half-expected gruesome depictions of targets exploding and a lot of rah-rah military prose and flag-waving.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br /><br />I found the book straightforward and insightful, and I now have an even greater appreciation for the sacrifices that our soldiers and their families make than I did before the book.  Mr. Kyle avoids praising himself and directs it to many others, including members of the Marines and Army.  His descriptions of kills are not at all colorful and are usually so deficient of detail that they have disappointed many readers.  Didn't bother me.<br /><br />Some have criticized Mr. Kyle for callous comments about the enemy (\\"savages\\"), for painting most Iraqis as knuckleheads, and for once expressing a joy in doing his job.  To me, he's just being honest.  I'm not going to fault him for that.
0375869026|5.0|My 5th grader has craniofacial anomalies and I feel that this book could not have been better written.  RJ Palacio caught Auggie's voice so well and captured his challenges and strengths so beautifully that I still can't believe that she doesn't have a child who is living this life.  I'm not going to try to summarize the story as many other reviewers have done that - I just want to talk about the emotional resonance of the work.<br /><br />The sheer truth of Auggie's journey is what meant the most to me.  There are so many small moments that struck me to the core - e.g. Auggie's feelings about Halloween, the way Auggie has an easier time when his classmates understand that there's more to him than his face, Auggie's struggle to move past his need for coddling, even the food that Auggie eats.  The most emotional moment for me came toward the end of the book when Auggie's father tells him that he loves the way Auggie looks, because that it exactly how my husband and I feel about our son.<br /><br />I wish that everyone would read this book, because it will help them understand the humanity of my son and everyone like him.
030746363X|2.0|At first, this book seems to have the answers for everything.  The more you read, however, the more contradictory advice, unfounded theory, and questionable logical extrapolation you come across.<br /><br />For instance, the author drinks a \\"large glass\\" (14oz) of OJ upon waking and before bed to test the effects of fruit on fat loss/gain.  1 \\"normal\\" glass or serving of OJ is 8oz, which is the equivalent of about 4 oranges (and incidentally is of higher caloric density than coke).  So the author is downing 16 oranges every day, 8 of which occur right before bed (which is the most effective time for fat storage), which is neither natural or healthy.  Of course this does wonders to mess with his body, which forms the basis of his subsequent conclusion that all fruit is unhealthy and should be eliminated from the diet.  Ridiculous and misleading.  We also learn later he was simultaneously testing several other regimens during this time.<br /><br />There are a number of other examples- plenty of supplements he recommends as essential in one part of the book that are not even mentioned in others.  Or to run fast you should take fewer steps.. that is, unless you're training for a race, in which case your problem is to take more steps, not fewer.<br /><br />Basically this book is a blend of common sense, science, product endorsement, tangential personal anecdotes, random celebrity expert advice, questionable logical extrapolation, and unfounded theory, which is neither mutually consistent, exclusive or collectively exhaustive.<br /><br />Note: If you are obese, you will probably still lose weight following the advice in this book.  Something is better than nothing.

B005WY8YZW|3.0|...I love Puscifer.  The music's great.  I ordered this from amazon stock and when it arrived the cd actually says it was manufactured by amazon and the songs on the cd appear in a different order than the cd that was released by Puscifer.  Either I wasn't paying attention or something shady is going on or both.  I wanted to buy the cd and support the artist not end up with a CDR made by a secondary company.  I've been dealing with Amazon for about 10yrs now and this is the first time something like this has happened.  I didn't even know it could be legal to sell something Amazon made as actual work of the artist...not a digital download but an actual physical product.  Anyway, be aware of what you're shopping for while you're shopping.  First weird experience with Amazon in 10yrs, I've ordered cd's and dvd's since this purchase and everything has been great...CHEERS!!

0525478817|5.0|What a great experience to read this book.  It is for everyone - not just young people.  Hazel and Augustus are young, true, but wise way beyond their years.  I laughed out loud and cried too.  I was sad when it was finished.  Perfection. Read it.
B0001AUAU4|5.0|I had never heard of this artist before. I listened to the album briefly and fell in love with it. I love it that it's acoustic.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I use my laptop for marine navugation as well as with my motor home. With the new windows 7 64 system there was no serial port for the com port and the adapter I have would freeze up the system about every other time I started it up. With the Globalsat USB my computer works great. The only think I had to do was download an upgraded GPS Info program, the antenna worked on both nav. programs, but the GPS Info program that was on the CD would not see the com port.

B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Yeah,Tony Bennett isn't what he was 20 years ago, but he is still Tony Bennett.  I saw the performance on PBS while in the hospital and it totally made my day. I would rather listen to these songs I can still sing and remember the words to than the unadulterated  Rap Crap Noise passing for music today.  The arrangements and Tony made some of some of his duet singers sound stronger than they actually are. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of \\"Lady Gaga\\"  who is a real talent and I always enjoy Willie and Queen Latifah, Winehouse seems no great loss and I hope Aretha finds the note she is searching for some day. I found the Album worth the price.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|its a good game. good to kill time. my expectations was high from others review and hype about this game.
B0062NAX1U|1.0|First of all I am Christian.  I do not buy into this bologna.  My father and brother in law were raised by their mothers alone with no father figures ever. My husband's father was never present in his life except to ridicule or discipline.  These three men are three of the Best Fathers I know and none of them had fathers in their lives.  They are all professional, Christian men who put their families first. They did not drop out of school and have not been arrested.  Your life is what you make it and you can overcome if you persevere.  I will not buy into this.  Of course men should not only be sperm donors, but if that's all they end up being that does not mean their children are doomed in life.  Get over this. I've seen plenty of nice close knit families with great male support models/father figures fall apart with many issues with their children ---- drugs, arrests, addictions, suicides, divorces, domestic abuse, etc.  This movie is narrow minded and trite.  Not to mention the acting just plain stinks.  Do not waste your time.

B0031RSA24|5.0|Richard Dawkins submits well thought out evidence based arguments that are well worth reading. The God Delusion is an great book and if you are open minded enough, you should definitely read it, or at least read the sample.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game!! I am totally addicted. I like that you can go back to previous levels to earn hints for the parts where you really get stuck.

B0063GORYU|5.0|fun great game for all ages and fun go to game to play I had tons of fun playing this game
0439023513|2.0|After reading the first book I was hooked! Both the first and second book were captivating, to the point where I read both of them in one day! The third book...not so much...I had to force my way through it, like eating a giant bowl of vomit. It took me a week to finish it because it was so not interesting. What a let down this was!  I wish the author would have took their time with this one I stead of bulldozing through it, it could have been an amazing end to the trilogy :(
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Excellent game for 99 cents. I hope Fire Maple makes more like this and Grisly Manor. They both have great graphics and the puzzles are challenging but not impossible.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome it takes some work to get what you want in the game but afterawile its awesome
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is fun for the whole family to play and challenging at times. My kids love to play and challenge each other.

1567184855|5.0|There are a plethera of 'spiritual' books on the shelves at the moment and it's often hard to decide which one to go for next. I would most certainly recommend Journey of Souls , not only for people interested in reincarnation (if you are then it is a must) but for anyone who is interested in spirituality. Why? Well it's fascinating. From the off you are gripped with accounts from people who have spent time 'between lives' and this continues to the end. You will discover what happens to a person's soul at the time of death, who meets you, guides, soul mates, life reviews, how we plan future lives, signposts that we put in place, life purposes, different soul types, how past lives can affect our present life, and much more - like I said, fascinating. Michael Newton comes across as someone who is absolutely genuine, and the book is written very well making for easy reading. It is not complicated (like some books can be) and certainly not the run-of-the-mill stuff that you seem to read over and over again nowadays in different spiritual books. This is truly original, uniquely written and easy to follow. The author reveals details obtained through hypnotic regression from twenty-nine of his subjects which sheds light on their current life by discovering about their past lives and time between lives. I have had past life regression sessions myself using Michael Newton's techniques so I know that these accounts are genuine. A thoroughly enjoyable read. I have had my copy many years now and have read it several times over as it is so good. Highly recommended.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I'm one of those people who hate the self-help movement but can't stop hoping that the next book is actually going to make a difference, that it's the one that going to make me stop procrastinating and deal with my bad habits. So, I keep on reading books and blogs, only to be disappointed.<br /><br />Not so with this book.<br /><br />While the book offers the regular mix of science, personal experiences and tips, it's more down-to-earth than other books I have read. Maybe that's because it's based on a course that actually dealt with people going through the motions described in this book.<br /><br />Usually, I read a book, highlight what I think makes sense and move on without incorporating what I just noted. In this case, I'm remembering on a daily basis what the author wrote and implementing her suggestions. It might actually be the last self-help book I ever read.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|DOWNLOAD IT! THE BEST GAME I HAVE FOUND YET! I GET BORED EASY AND THIS GAME HAS ME HOOKED! THEY NEED RED WRECKER 2....? PLEASE
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|Bruce has become a no-fun, clichéd leftist. He cries out against unemployment, economic hardship, and the travails of the \\"common man.\\" Good causes: The economy has lost 1500 jobs per day since the guy Bruce supported and continues to support won office. The number of people on food stamps is at a record 45 million, having increased 40% in the last two years alone. 2011 was the worst year for new home sales in the history of our country. Fuel prices are at an all-time high, and with them, groceries and everything else we need fuel for.<br /><br />Yet here comes Bruce, championing the hard-up while he pushes for four more years of the wretched policies that caused all this. His lyrics feature original insights like calling bankers \\"fat.\\" You know, the bankers who got screwed by all the irresponsible people that got in over their heads and welched on their loans.  (Maybe bankers look fat because so many of them are belly-up.)  Like the Occupy crowd and in violation of all sense and evidence, Bruce places the blame on the private sector--which of course means us, his fans. The private sector is where we live, work, voluntarily transact, take out loans, eat, and support our families--and pay exorbitant ticket prices for a seat in the nosebleeds to hear Bruce sing out against greed.<br /><br />I love Springsteen musically and probably always will.  I just wish he'd get back to writing songs that are more than DNC talking points.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is free does more than weatherbug and takes the widget takes up less space! sorry weatherbug but were through on my droid.
0439023521|1.0|I tried.  I really, really tried.  I tried to read the entire book.  But by page 100-something I was so bored with slogging through Collins' sophomoronic (yes, you read that right) prose that I tossed the book into the round file, after which I fished it out and donated it to our co-op's bookshelf in the laundrymat.  Someone might find it useful for killing time between the wash cycle and the spin cycle.<br /><br />The writing in \\"The Hunger Games\\" is from hunger.  Even Stephenie Meyer writes better than this, and that is saying a lot.  Page after page of vapid descriptions that tell us essentially nothing.  We know there's going to be blood and gore all over the floor at some point but before you're halfway there you wonder if it's worth the trip and then decide it isn't.  The main characters are more like caricatures; Collins has no idea how to flesh them out and make them come alive for us.  And the plot is not so simple as simple-minded.  Big bad government turns poor innocent children into gladiators for fun and games.  And of course somewhere down the line there has to be a romance between the boy and the girl.  The whole thing sounds like a bad comic book.<br /><br />Actually, the overall story has been much better told in Koushun Takami's \\"Battle Royale\\" and Stephen King's \\"The Running Man\\".  But unlike Collins, these authors know how to write.  \\"The Hunger Games\\" would probably have been a much better book if somebody else had written it.<br /><br />Judy Lind
B005HSL626|3.0|This game isn't too bad, but kind of repetitive.  But, overall worth the download. Personally I don't find myself commingled back to it.
0743277708|5.0|What a perfectly wonderful surprise to become privy to the secret world of rabbits; the struggles and triumphs they endure, as well as the creatures and circumstances they encounter as part of their everyday life, be they friend or threat.<br />Life as a rabbit, as the author points out, is a very social existance, and the success of the rabbits who live together depends directly on their ability to form and sustain a solid social order, complete with rules, boundaries, a social order within the warren, a safe and orderly warren in a strtegic location, and many other factors that those of us who have not read this book, probably do not know. The author takes great pains to ensure that what he is writing is not just a great story -- which it most assuredly is -- but that it accurately depicts and represents the circumstances and known habits, tendencies, fears, sounds, everything pertaining to what you read about the rabbits and their actions and reactions -- all of this has been researched by the author to bring you a very real experience, while leaving you simply thinking what a good book you are reading, and unaware that the reason is the amount of work that went into the book to make it seem so seemless and flowing. It is a fine example of how a great author can take a tough topic and make it seem like child's play. Here, Richard Adams has taken the concept of talking rabbits, with their own language, had them exercise the audacity to leave their home warren --based on a vision of a runt rabbit -- which was the only place they had ever lived --then traipsed them across miles of the English countryside, through dangers aplenty, finally to arrive at a settling place, where a new life and more dangers awaited them.<br />Watership Down is a brilliantly written book by a wonderfully talented storyteller. I first read it back when it came out around 1980...reading it again, it speaks to me in a whole new way, on levels I had not appreciated before. So, may I suggest that you read it more than once? And perhaps you should consider not waiting 30+ years before doing so? hehehe!<br />Great book! I highly recommend!
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|They have a formula for what works.  The songs are upbeat, pop-format basic, and catchy. My only concern is that Kelley is downplayed as compared to their previous stuff.  He is highly talented and has depth and range that really put her to shame. She's ok but female vocalists are a dime-a-dozen in her league. Oh well, it's all about the $$ after all so that is what the public wanted to see. Still good stuff.
B0063GORYU|4.0|sometimes it doesn't seem to be very responsive, but that could just be my Fire.  Spider is tons of fun!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game. good time waster. simple games but lots of them. I approve this message. peace out.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|Wow, this is amazing stuff.  Gilmour is in fantastic form - both voice and guitar.  Great close-up shots of his hands are priceless for us guitarists.  Seeing Rick Wright in one of his final appearances was bittersweet.<br /><br />Only nits are so-so picture quality, and while pointless audience shots were mostly absent, there is the dancing fat guy during Comfortably Numb.  I'd have much rather seen more of Bowie!
B004UC1WN8|4.0|Jennifer Lopez's sixth English studio album, Love?, is just like her others albums; songs about love, heartbreak, and dancing. What makes Love? different from the other's, though, is that it's produced by RedOne, who really knows what he's doing, and the songs are way more likable then on her previous albums. Here's a track by track review:<br /><br />On The Floor: strong track, but not a standout track due to the fact that the verses of the song are better than the actual chorus, which basically consists of \\"la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la\\",. The chorus is the most important part, and the chorus of this song is weak.<br /><br />Good Hit: tolerable but not really likable, making the overall song whack. Lyrics are dumb, beat is decent.<br /><br />I'm Into You: Can't stand Lil Wayne, but besides him, this track is pretty decent, and could of been a hit if it had more radio airplay, which it didn't<br /><br />What Is (Love?): Sets the overall tone for the album. What I found strange about this song is that she's stating \\"what if she's never found and left behind, should she keep hoping for love?\\", but the song was obviously recorded and released while she was with Marc Anthony, her former husband. Kind of reminds me of Beyonce's 'Single Ladies', even though she was married to Jay-Z when the song came out and still is married to him.<br /><br />Run The World: Cute lyrics, but overall a weak track on the album, due to the chorus isn't strong whatsoever, it sounds just like the verses.<br /><br />Papi: Pretty decent track, not one of my favorites, but the beat is good<br /><br />Until It Beats No More: A beautiful track, lyrics are amazing and the beat is very touching; a strong track on the album<br /><br />One Love: Good song, but it's kind of reminds me of 'What Is (Love?)',  expect not asking the same exact question. What Is (Love?) asks 'should I keep hoping for love?\\", while this track asks \\"Is there one love?\\", which to me is sort of like the same thing<br /><br />Invading My Mind: Eh, it's okay. I feel that the beat takes away from the lyrics, because since the lyrics aren't strong enough, the beat overpowers it<br /><br />Villian: Reminds me of J.Lo's older songs from her previous albums. Not anything special, but it's decent<br /><br />Starting Over: Again, kind of reminds me of her older songs. Nothing special<br /><br />Hypnotico: A fun dance track, lyrics aren't that amazing but the beat makes up for it; the track was written by Lady Gaga, believe it or not, so that explains why it's fun.<br /><br />Deluxe Edition tracks:<br /><br />Everybody's Girl: kind of boring, reminds me again of J.Lo's old albums<br /><br />Charge Me Up: pretty decent track overall, something to dance too<br /><br />Take Care: I personally like this track a lot, I find it very catchy and fun, although sort of cheesy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome but kind - a  hard for a liitle game. also its to cheesy of a game but a good game. :) :( :) :( :) :( :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I reallly like this game<br />its addicting.<br />nothing wrong with it. I play it everyday.<br />I say you should deffinatly get it.

0439023483|5.0|The book arrived faster then I thought and I couldn't put it down once I received it! The Hunger Games is one of the best books I've ever read. I definitely recommend it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great album! I take it to work w/me & put it on repeat. One of the few CDs I've listened to all the way through. Enjoyed her performance at the Grammys! Can't wait for her next album.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I didn't stumble upon this series until Book 5 had been released, and I am so glad it happened that way.  This series is such a fantastic, gripping read.  It's well written, nicely paced, and the characters have a lovely depth.  The idea behind the story is fantastic and scarily plausible in our futures. I thoroughly enjoyed the Wool series, and was very excited to find the Molly Fyde series (by Hugh Howey) to jump onto next!
B005AACJZY|5.0|Have always like Maroon 5, bought this album for the Moves Like Jagger love it. Not sure why, but its makes me want to move.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I was skeptical when I tried this game but it plays just like a full size pinball game.. and portable too! The gameplay is just as I remember from the arcades.
0385344228|4.0|If you love courtroom dramas, this is a good one for you! The characters are developed well, and there are definitely some plot twists along the way. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there were a few parts in the first half that could have sped along a little quicker. Great book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Always one of my favorites.... really enjoying it on my Kindle Fire! !!!! I highly recommend it.... nice to be able to take it with you...
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is an awesomely redemptive tale of a post apocalyptic future.  I started the book and could not put it down (I am so glad I was late to the party - the omnibus edition meant I could rad the whole tale at one sitting, more or less)<br /><br />The story arc is beautifully presented, and provides  a glimpse into a well crafted universe from the perspective of some very interesting characters.  I am looking forwards to finding out more...<br /><br />In my opinion, Mr. Howey has already achieved great things, and I eagerly await his next works - even if I must pay premium rates for them!  I will be adding him to my must-have list of authors (a very short list indeed)
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This movie is funny as hell.  I  loved this movie.  I will watch it over and over.  Justin Timberlake was great too.
0439023521|5.0|This was an awesome book. Found myself reading way too late at night in bed because I couldn't put it down. Same for the second two books in the trilogy. The movie looks like it will be great also. I don't understand why they have this book listed for kids/young adults. There are some fairly violent scenes throughout the trilogy so I think it's rated incorrectly. Either way, fantastic read. I was disappointed when it ended and I couldn't keep reading it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome .... awesome. Best series ever, cant wait to see what happens. The entire series is exceptional and exciting. Would. Love to see this in a movie
B002BWP49M|5.0|You either like the movies or you don't. Of course, I do so I am very please with the product and the customer service.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|Great continuation to an already great ongoing franchise. The special effect in this film blow many of the earlier films away. This is one of those films that is worth owning. Can't wait to see if this will be another continuing saga.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Well this film is that level of fun. After kicking into gear they quickly take an old and familiar setting and bring it into the modern day (figuratively that is, since this is actually set in the late 19th century). They manage to do this without making it too youth oriented. The true fun in this film will be in rewatching it, the quick banter and fun plot twists that turn out to be thought out well in advance (for the most part), will only be more enjoyable upon multiple viewings. The layers, much like those found in the Pirates script, are multiple and cerebral. They hit the viewer without our full awareness and when we later realize this it brings a smirk if not a smile to the face. Many plot points that seem by chance or appear to be toss away jokes end up returning and playing a larger role in the story, it's nice to see some effort in a big budget blockbuster - especially when its a sequel.<br /><br />The action and staging of set pieces might not properly belong in the era portrayed (according to some critics) but it makes for a fun and well balanced film in my opinion. This isn't meant to be historically accurate, its meant to be a version of history much like Gladiator or Pirates. The performances are excellent and I found RDJ to be even more comfortable in his role as Holmes, surprising since he has so many other films and franchises now on his plate. Having laid the groundwork in the first film he spends more of the film flexing Holme's emotional levels, mainly regarding his relations to Watson and Irene Adler. Jude Law becomes much more familiar as Watson and thus becomes much more likable because this time he adheres to the objective with much less resistance (possibly because he has a chance to really let out his frustrations with Holmes early on). The two obviously have that strong relationship that goes beyond friendship, something Ritchie quite enjoys playing with but that makes for something different and refreshing while allowing for moments of strong humor.<br /><br />Also compelling was Noomi Rapace, filling a space left by McAdams departure after a short but meaningful cameo early in the film. Noomi is given somewhat of a small role and largely facilitates plot purposes but her character does have an arc and emotional stakes that make her important to the story, if not always fully utilized. She of course develops an interest in Holmes but again this is well justified given the events that transpire and doesn't feel as forced as one would assume. Another new face is Jared Harris, who is a very cerebral Moriarty. I really enjoyed his performance but was prepped for it, having enjoyed him on the series Mad Men. For those not familiar with his \\"proper/formal\\" Englishman style I'm not sure if he will come across as menacing as some might hope or expect, even based on the first film. I thought he played the villain in a unique way and did so quite well.<br /><br />In short, if you enjoyed the first you will enjoy this, at least I don't see how you couldn't. If you didn't enjoy the first because of the occult vs. science storyline, the pacing, or perhaps the uneven still developing characters, I will say I personally found this one to be much improved and much more comfortable with itself all around. I did enjoy the first but never thought I'd need to see it again, but I found myself rewatching it after seeing this sequel, and this film I want to own and rewatch, again and again, just as I do with Pirates Curse of the Black Pearl.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game loads most of the time, however the gameplay is very glitchy and does not run well on TFP running ICS. Very poor work for PopCap and for the developer who ported the game.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This game freezes solid on my TF Prime.<br />I cannot even get through a whole level without having to kill it and start from the beginning several times.<br /><br />I want my $2.99 back...
B000063DGC|1.0|I just bought the Ozzie Osbourne/Randy Rhoades CD and what a deliberate rip-off. Naturally I was expecting \\"Crazy Train\\" and \\"Flying High Again\\" studio version. But no! Instead they pass off this poorly recorded live stuff as a \\"Tribute\\" to Randy Rhoades! And they can't say it wasn't deliberate either. Nowhere on the cover does the work \\"Live\\" appear, nor are the times for the songs listed. I mean that way the customer might notice that where the time for the original was say 4:31 and the time on this CD was 7:02, and realize something was fishy. I did notice the words \\"Reissue\\" and \\"Remastering from original masters.\\" So to say this was not a deliberate attempt to deceive the buyer is, I feel, being disingenuous.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Have watched the first two so far.  I'd never read the books or seen any of the movies yet.  Very entertaining.
0743454537|4.0|I guess I can understand why so many people say they hated the ending but I thought it was perfect. In fact, it's the only ending that could've really worked. If you think of what you might've wanted to happen, it wouldn't have had the same resonance.<br /><br />Good story. The audio version is well done with different narrators handling each section narrated in first person by the different characters. Makes me want to read more by Picoult. (This was just my second book of hers, after the also good \\"Nineteen Minutes.\\")

0385344228|5.0|I just finished this book in 2 sittings, and I am still reeling from the ending.  I read a lot, and I can honestly say that I have never been so drawn into a story as I was reading this book.  I felt as though I was sitting in a living room, with a fire roaring, listening to a master storyteller.  The way in which the grand jury testimony was interwoven with the narrative was simply amazing.  This is a new author for me, and I plan to order additional works by him.  Incredible read!!!

B0073Q0IY2|2.0|Forgive me, perhaps it's my age (over 50) or the fact that good acting makes a good movie.  The Thing #1 ~ original done in 1951 was in black and white, had no special effects, great plot,  acting was good and it all equalled a great movie ~ the one that gave James Arness the break he needed to get into the movie business (it was his first role).<br /><br />The Thing #2 was of course quite a bit different with the added special effects, Kurt Russell and a very feasible story line.

0307959856|4.0|It's like I've been reading Jane Austen's own hand. P.B.James is such a master wordsmith. She captures time and place -- I can almost see Colin (Firth) and Jennifer (Ehle). . .I mean, Darcy and Elizabeth here in the 21st Century playing out their lives. It's like having a sequel 100 years later.

B006BQI1V2|5.0|I loved the book, & when the movie came out it was only shown in theatres that usually show only documentaries, & foreign films so I missed it.  I am so pleased to purchase the DVD, & it was very well done.  Watched it several times, & will again.
1612130585|2.0|I enjoyed the first book though I wasn't always thrilled with how they depicted BDSM.  Some of it was just silly.  Still, I found the first book incredibly interesting.  I thought the problems with the first book would mostly be solved with the second book, as it was named Fifty Shades DARKER.  I expected the book to be, you know, darker - for some strange reason.<br /><br />Instead, it's typical romance novel drivel.  The few intelligent and mature story lines in the first book dissolve into completely unbelievable, fake, fairy tale silliness.  I literally burst out loud laughing in parts with how ridiculous some of it was!  What happens in the book would never happen in real life, ever.<br /><br />I'd have given it a 1 but I did finish the book, so that deserves a two at least.  Seriously, one of the worst books I've ever read in my life, and I really liked the first book!  This book is just so terrible.  What a waste and a disappointment.

B0054YIQK8|2.0|I wish I had read the comments of the previous reviewer before buying this thing. Being a francophone, I don't need English subtitles when I listen to Carmen. I was so irritated to see the ugly yellow subtitles over this beautiful film that I had to stop watching it after 15 minutes.<br /><br />My suggestion to Olive Films: make an effort and offer the translation in more than one language as most major labels do; but most of all, allow the viewer to remove the subtitles.<br /><br />Now this Blu-ray disc will make a perfect coaster for my coffee table.

0439023513|3.0|I was absolutely sobbing near the end of this book. I felt absolutely gutted and destroyed. There was blow after blow after blow. I kept thinking \\"When is this book going to end? I can't take much more\\". I think the author did a brilliant job in that way. This book was a commentary on war. She gets it. She took you there and she showed you every horrible thing, every worst nightmare come to light.<br /><br />My biggest issue is that this trilogy is said to be written for \\"young adults\\". That usually makes me think of middle school/high school kids being the main targets. The main character is a teen aged girl. There is a \\"love triangle\\" which will draw the girls like bees to flowers. That is where the \\"young adult\\" label ends. All the young kids flocking to these books will all be in the mindset of Twilight. The Hunger Games movie has created a massive hype and brought more kids in. Twilight-esque romance is NOT what they are getting. This book is devastating. It's not a happy ending. It's not an exciting resolution. It's a death march where the lead character herself begins to wish for and actively seek out death. As I was reading it I kept thinking \\"There is  NO WAY I am allowing my 12 year old step daughter to read this book. No way  on this planet would I expose her to this.\\" She is too young to grasp the commentary, to understand that the extreme violence has a meaning and is meant to show the atrocities of war. All she will know is that characters she has been lead to love and care about are being destroyed in the most grotesque ways possible. I don't have a problem with books like this. I think they are important, but I think that there needs to be some care taken in the audience that is being targeted. These books are not like Twilight. They are not like Harry Potter. Even the Harry Potter books had dark themes and there were characters killed that were much beloved, but it was not like this. I hope that parents understand that these books bear no likeness to those series whatsoever.<br /><br />Someday my step daughter will be old enough to understand these books. She read the first one without my knowing what she was really reading and was she dancing with glee when Peeta and Katniss kissed. That was all she was thinking about. That was the story she was grabbing a hold of. She was thinking \\"Happy Ending\\". As the premise of the books seemed awfully violent I read them before she started on the second book. I am glad I did. I think all parents should read these books before allowing their children to start them. My step daughter is still young and her eyes are filled with innocent romance and thoughts of first love. I will NOT allow that fragile bubble to be shattered by allowing her to read the second and third books. Not yet. I want her to stay young and innocent for a little while longer. I don't want her to be shattered and gutted the way I was.

B000002KBD|5.0|Great record from Van. He has  many strong different sounding records over a long career and this is one i only recently got.  Now it is among my favorites by Van. I really like how this record is driven by his bluesy acoustic guitar playing prominently throughout. Great songs all the way through and real good flow to the record. Van's The Man. And this is one of his best. So many to choose from and each one a little different but the vibe here and especially the great songs make this essential. After this one check out Veedon Fleece one of my long time favorites.

0316098329|5.0|OMG! I just finished this book and I LOVED IT!! The voice of the little boy Jack telling the story was brilliant. From the first page to the last the reader gets a sense of the psychological turmoil that he and his Ma go through is so real and heartbreaking. I found that the story was easy to follow and even though there were times where it felt a bit slow, I could NOT give it less than 5 stars because the story was not only easy to relate to but also just full of things that anyone who has gone through something like in this book or knows someone that may have gone through it. Big Nick was not only an abusive prick but just despicable. I found Jack to be a sweet and inquisitive kid who just wanted to know everything about everything and that made him even more real. The mom's part in the story (what happened) made complete sense and the author really understood where people could have what happened to her often happens in real life. The last scene where Ma and Jack find a way to get closure was so well written. It was hard not to kind of tear up a bit. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a smart, poinient look at abuse and its aftermath on not only the ones abused but also anyone connected to them. 5 stars all the way!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Fun to read and worth the purchase. But not all parts of it are believable. That's fine for me because it was fun to read even if some aspects weren't totally true.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool has been one of my favorite reads this year. When I finished the first part I immediately thought two things:<br /><br />1. This short story was well worth the full cost of the collection.<br />2. There is no way that the remaining four parts will be this great.<br /><br />Thankfully, I was wrong regarding 2. Wool fractals out, blossoming as each subsequent section reveals new perspectives. Comparisons to the Fallout video game series are trite, they describe only the simplest setting elements of Wool. I place Wool alongside science fiction greats like I, Robot.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of Howey's works and would love to return to Wool for more stories from the silo. I think the best of any genre uses its trappings to show glimpses of humanity that are unclear from an everyday perspective. Wool succeeds at this grandly and I recommend it heartily to not only fans of science fiction, but anyone who wants to read a superbly crafted story.

1401216676|5.0|...and there names were Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan.  These two directors used this classic comic as part of the inspiration for there respective representations of Batman on the silver screen. I fell Nolan's film is not only a over-all better movie but also the one which better captures what is so remarkable about \\"The Killing Joke\\"!<br /><br />Let me make one thing perfectly clear: I am by no means an avid fan of comics. I respect the art form but it's very rarely appealed to me. Of the few comics that I've read the only ones I truly enjoyed were all written by Alan Moore: \\"The Killing Joke\\", \\"Watchmen\\", and \\"Miracleman #15: Nemesis\\" (thanks to someone posting all the pages for this rare and AMAZING issue on-line). I have read a bit of Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and Moore's \\"V for Vendetta\\". Despite some awesome moments I still think about (\\"A reflection\\" from TDKR and \\"This Vicious Cabaret\\" from VFV), I couldn't keep up with either of them. I own Art Spiegelman's \\"Maus\\" but I haven't had a chance to read it yet, though it sounds right up my alley. The reason for this background is that as a guy who's not a huge comic book fan, THIS COMIC RULES!!!<br /><br />With less than 100 pages, Alan Moore does so many things: create a \\"definitive\\" (well, as much as can be done for a character who's past is \\"multiple choice\\") backstory for the Joker, suggest that Batman and Joker have far more in common than either character realizes, and create a mood of moral decay and uncertainly while not fully giving into that mood (though not enough to cancel it out). But the icing on the cake is how Moore is able to portray the Joker as an unredeemable monster, tormented philosopher, and a tragic human being all at the same time! A lot of Health Ledger's Joker is foreshadowed by Moore's Joker.<br /><br />Of countless standout moments, there are two which deserve praise. The first is the Joker explain his world view to Batman, how life is a \\"monstrous demented gag\\". The words are so well-written and powerful, both because of there fundamental bleakness and the fact that the Joker is truly trying to explain his worldview to Batman. Perhaps hoping for some understanding or at least for proof that he's not alone in the madness. If you want to hear the brilliance of these words and the emotion, I recommend going to Youtube and listening to \\"Mark Hamill- The Killing Joke\\" by the Youtube user \\"Pgirts\\". A nearly spot-on mimicking of Mark Hamill's voice (the voice of the Joker from \\"Batman: the Animated Series\\"), music from the movie \\"Batman Returns\\" (a second movie made by the first of the \\"two guys in a lunatic asylum\\"), and the text combine to create something shocking weight.<br /><br />The second is as fitting as it is shocking. In keeping with the title, this tale of insanity and despair ends on a joke. I won't dare spoil it because it is awesome on so many levels! But what I will do is end this review with the words of Moore's Rorschach from \\"Watchmen\\" about his Pagliacci joke: \\"Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|\\"You want hearts and flowers. Anastasia.\\" His voice is soft. \\"It's not something I know.\\"Gasp, and I'm Eve in the Garden of Eden, and he's the serpent, and I cannot resist.Who can resist temptation in the Garden of Eden?? I know Eve sure couldn't, and guess what, she was just as guilty of consequences as the serpent, because she knewbetter.<br /><br />Anastasia is a brilliant, charming, beautiful, witty, easily relatable protagonist that I simply adored. From the moment Anastasia Steele meets Christian Grey, the fun, sexy, dark, scary, challenging, beautiful, thrill ride began. She was warned by Christian to stay far away from him, he was no good for her, but she couldn't resist the temptation for this beautiful \\"Fifty shades of F'd\\" up man.<br /><br />\\"Anastasia, you should steer clear of me. I'm not the man for you.\\"<br /><br />Let me just start out by saying that E.L. James took me on a dark, spectacular, sexy, scary thrill ride that I never want to forget. In Fifty Shades of Grey were introduced to chivalrous bad boy Christian Grey  *Fan girl scream, jumping up and down, screaming* CEO and multi-millionaire entrepreneur.<br /><br />\\"Because I'm fifty shades of f'd up, Anastasia.\\"<br /><br />Anastasia is a wholesome twenty one year old college graduate with goals, values, and self respect. She's completely smitten with this lustworthy Christian Grey immediately. What I found so fascinating about her was that she wasn't willing to bow down abd succumb to Chrustishs rules and regulations. She's intelligent, and doesn't take no for an answer  and pushes the envelope when  she should.<br /><br />\\"You know, when you fell into my office to interview me, you were all `yes, sir', `no, sir'. I thought you were a natural born submissive. But quite frankly, Anastasia, I'm not sure you have a submissive bone in your delectable body.\\" He moves slowly toward me as his speaks, his voice tense.\\"<br /><br />Whereas Christian is wealthy, gorgeous, arrogant, charismatic, bossy, domineering and is unfamiliar with boundaries and the word NO. Since Anna is the first woman willing to love him in spite of his darkness, while showering him with love, but not bowing down to his demands while exposing his vulnerable side hes had hidden behind his dark vices for too long. This throws Christian for a loop and he can't help but stay fascinated with the intelligent, and charming  Anastasia Steele.<br /><br />This book explores love, lust, pain, fear, trust, and pushes the boundaries while doing  it. The succulent Domineering Christian is an emotional virgin, a victim of sexual abuse by an older woman as a young teen has left him empty, and hollow, and unable of having a relationship based on love and not pain, that is until he meets  feisty fun-loving Anastasia Steele.<br /><br />\\"Poor, f'd-up, kinky, philanthropic Christian - though I'm sure he wouldn't see himself this way and would repel any thoughts of sympathy or pity.\\"<br /><br />This an adult romantic fantasy book, and those that disagree with the behavior of the the female protagonist and her male love interests are forgetting one very important detail: Anastasia NEVER SIGNS THE SUB/DOM CONTRACT Christian gave her.<br /><br />This is not a book about abuse, or rape, calculated anger, this is a book about a broken man, a lovely woman, who enter into a consensual BDSM relationship. This is a couple who engage in a romantic relationship with an advantageous sex life, and here thanks to E.L. James, we get to witness first hand, the wonderful, the unbelievably sad and tumultuous nature of the that relationship.<br /><br />I agree to the conditions Angel, because you know best what my punishment ought to be; only-only- don't make it worse than I can bear.<br /><br />Fifty shades of Grey contains some of the most fun, playful, loving, whirlwind exciting romantic scenes and my most cherished moments in this book was the playful loving interaction between Christian and Anastasia via email. Those I won't spoil for you, but the at where my love affair with these two progressed.<br /><br />\\"I don't do the girlfriend thing. `I'm not a hearts and flowers kind of guy.`I don't make love.' This is all I know.\\"<br /><br />I am completly obsessed with this trilogy. From the gorgeous Christian Grey *takes up all the space in my fantasies lately* Anastasia is a wonderful character, that I feel represents a strong willed, positively portrayed female.<br /><br />When I wasn't reading Fifty, I was thinking about it. I was enamored with this book immediately and I'm now obsessed with this series! This book is not for the faint of heart but it is beautiful, passionte and By the last chapter left me a broken and heartbroken myself, I was sobbing; but those tumultuous love stories are always my most, memorable, favorite, obsessive and fascinating reads. I loved Fifty Shades of Grey!!!!!<br /><br />\\"Oh - what have I done?<br /><br />I fall onto my bed, shoes and all, and howl. The pain is indescribable... physical, mental... metaphysical... it is everywhere, seeping into the marrow of my bones. Grief. This is grief - and I've brought it on myself. Deep down, a nasty, unbidden thought comes from my inner goddess, her lip curled in a snarl... the physical pain from the bite of a belt is nothing, nothing compared to this devastation. I curl up, desperately clutching the flat foil balloon and Taylor's handkerchief, and surrender myself to my grief.\\"

0439023513|3.0|**Spoilers**<br />Let me start off by saying I loved books 1 & 2, but I was VERY disappointed in book 3.  As many have said it left so many unanswered questions and lack of exploration.  I think the thing that bothers me the most of the lack of expansion on Peeta and Katniss at the end.  I don't think I was expecting a fairy tale ending but I was expecting a little more than a 1 line summation.  I felt that Collins should have explored their \\"growing back together\\" and the ups and downs of their recovery and reconnecting, rebuilding that relationship, not exactly the same but similarly to their conversations in the cave, on the train on in the hunger games/quarter quell.  It would have been nice to see them heal together, knowing they'll never be the same but still showing some connection that I know the readers loved from books 1 & 2.<br /><br />Instead Katniss seems completely indifferent to her relationship with Peeta, like she ended up with him because there was no one else left and she had kids b/c that was what Peeta wanted.  She refers to her kids as  \\"the girl and the boy\\" not my son or daughter further showing her distance from Peeta and her family. She does not seem enthused about being with him and creating a new life and family.  Maybe that is what Collins intended but it felt hollow and cold.  I mean Katniss had a new beginning ahead but the book never explored that other than a 2 page epilogue.<br /><br />When really bad tragic things happen in life, it is the people that you love that make it better. When my dad died at age 54, my 6 month old son was my happy place, even though i was a mess inside and out, he got me through it and reminded me that life is worth living and there will be happy days again. I think that is what Collins was going for with the epilogue but it DID NOT get conveyed that way. I will never be the same person I was before my dad got sick and this applies to Katniss as well.  She is a different person in the end, she has to be but it doesn't seem that she finds happiness in the things she should.  Additionally, as many others have said she still appears to be a mental mess, broken beyond repair... but to me that hasn't been the Katniss character, she is a fighter and her throughout the 3rd book and the end being portrayed as mentally unstable and a heaping emotional mess.  She lets that define her and it shows that the Capitol and Snow are still controlling her, which I don't think is her character at all.<br /><br />Now on to Peeta, I hate that he wasn't in over 1/2 the book, I felt like the book dragged with war scenes and Collins could have sped that up and saved more for the human side post war panem and what was going on with our characters instead of glossing over it.  Additional, we never see how Peeta has recovered or if he even did. I hate that the Peeta we all fell in love with was gone and never seemed to come back. But we never get the chance to see him getting better, to see if he really is still in love with Katniss at the end or if he stays with her just because he has no one but her.<br /><br />This book was intended for YA and I think it misses that mark also and that is why the ending is disappointing, it is VERY adult with all the bloody war scenes and body parts.  Again, it is a slow read not a page turner like 1 & 2, it even makes me not want to see the movie, knowing how it all turns out.  I probably still will, but I hope with the Mockingjay movie, they delve in and explore the ending further so we can see if she really wanted to be with Peeta and have kids at the end or if she really was just a zombie of herself going through the motions of being with Peeta and the kids, still letting her experiences define her and have control...

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is great!  My 3 year old loves to draw and doodle.  I think the layout is really thought out.  There are several types of art tools:  marker, brush, pencil, and pattern brushes.  There are also different sizes to choose from.  I love the pattern brushes; you can really get creative them.  I also love the backgrounds you can choose from solid colors to scenery.  Plus you can save it too.  I've only tried this app on the Kindle Fire.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has kids or wants to kick back and have fun drawing.

0439023521|3.0|This is a good yarn, nothing more. But a book with this premise ought to be more. If you are going to raise subjects like totalitarianism and a depraved society that finds entertainment in the ultimate violence, it ought to carry more weight. Collins's protagonists pay brief lip service to how wrong it all is, but don't do anything about that till it's their own skins they need to save. For the most part, they go along to get along. A heroic character would challenge the evil. Collins gives them many an out by not having them ever be the aggressors when it comes to the kill - they kill in self-defense, by accident, or out of mercy. She shields them (and the reader) from having to face the moral dilemma. Basically, this is just an action book and will probably make a good movie. But there's less to it than meets the eye. It's a page turner but left me feeling empty.

Move it to the drama section please so fewer viewers are disappointed in the movie.

1612130283|5.0|I have to admit when I first became aware of this series, I was expecting something a little darker and more erotic.  To hear some of the stories and television reviews, this was a truly naughty set of books.  Now that being said, I really did enjoy this series.  It took me 2 days to read all three of the books(thank goodness they were all available on my Kindle!).  I laughed and giggled through most of the books, Ana really was very naive on so many levels.  I did find it strange that a 21 year old in today's society wasn't a little more knowledgeable in some of the sexual areas.  Not necessarily in the actual sexual acts themselves but she just seemed to lack some basic sexual knowledge.  Christian, what can I say about him other than yummy?  This is a man who knows what he wants and takes it.  I am in awe of his prowess.  I would recommend this series to anyone that wants a good love story with a little bit of edge to it.

The version of \\"This Charming Man\\" on the U.S. version of THE SMITHS is the only place it can be found (on vinyl).  \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" was initially released on the B-side of a U.K. single and later added to the HATFUL OF HOLLOW compilation in the U.K. The HATFUL OF HALLOW and THE WORLD WON'T LISTEN compilations were issued by Rough Trade solely for the U.K. market, while the U.S. market got the excellent, Sire issued LOUDER THAN BOMBS.  The \\"Complete\\" is referring only to the ALBUM TITLES (studio & compilations) released while under contract with Rough Trade (UK) & Sire (US).<br /><br />If you're looking to buy used Smiths vinyl, such as the U.S. versions of their first two releases, be prepared to pay at least $20.  Even used UK 12\\" singles are currently selling for at least $20.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is obviously a Brit trying to get into the mind of an American. Therefore, the editors should have caught the many words that are not used in American speech.  We do not call a vest a \\"waistcoat.\\"  Most Americans do not ask people's \\"surnames,' opting instead for \\"last name.\\"  The list goes on and on.<br /><br />How could a graduating college student who had lived in Las Vegas be so naive and innocent (Oh my goodness!) and why does Anastasia keep commenting in comic bubbles (Does she really?  How thrilling!).  The author needs to hone her craft and not be so trite.<br /><br />The story is pure Twilight fan fiction but I do wonder how these two ever manage to do anything since they seem to be having sex 20 out of 24 hours.  I know hormones run high in our twenties but this is ridiculous.  And the sex scenes got so boring I ended up skipping over them.<br /><br />The really interesting portion is Christian Grey and his - ahem - proclivities.  It's wonderful that he is turning into a Real Boy but the story gives no clue as to their real relationship as they never seem to discuss anything of consequence.  So why has he fallen for her so hard?  It's a mystery to me.
B003EYVXVE|5.0|I am a huge fan so im on the computer 24-7. I found out they made some changes so its not exactly true to the book...but Suzanne Collins made those changes in the script (she wrote the movie script) so I trust what she wrote. But other fans are very mad, I am too but I trust her.
B000002VC5|5.0|How do you follow up a brilliant debut album celebrating the writings of Edgar Allan Poe?  Celebrate the saga of man vs. machine---I ROBOT was Alan Parsons solution.  A stunning achievement to say the least.  Parsons and Eric Woolfson created a visionary masterpiece, filled with melodic instrumentals and vocals.<br />Starting off with the incessantly hypnotic title track and ending with the mournful GENESIS CH 1 VS 32, every track is APP at its progressive best.  The funky hit single I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE LIKE YOU.  The gorgeously passionate SOME OTHER TIME.  The military urgency of BREAKDOWN.  Don't let it show---one of Parsons' best ballads.  The Orwellian gloom of THE VOICE.  The carnival feel of DAY AFTER DAY.<br />The arrangements are flawless and guest vocalists like the Hollies Allan Clarke and Lenny Zatek give great vocal performances.<br />I ROBOT launched APP into the mass public eye and began his incredible string of remarkable albums.  A must have for fans of 70-80s progressive/orchestral rock.

I am disappointed in the rubberized coating.

A friend with the magenta colored cover did not have the same problem.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|\\"There is something ludicrous in the idea of so educating a generation which is born to the Ogpu [State Police in the USSR] and the atomic bomb. Since it is so likely that they will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherwise you are making their destiny not brighter but darker.\\" (C. S. Lewis \\"On Three Ways of Writing For Children,\\" [[ASIN:B005IUSIYM On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature]], 39)<br /><br />The best part of this movie, hands down, is Steve Rodgers BEFORE the vita-ray treatment.<br /><br />Consider the 90-pound asthmatic Steve Rodgers. He is persistent. He wishes to honor the life and death of his father. And he understands appropriate deception. This is understandable and forgivable, considering his chicken-little body, and his lion's heart. These are all heroic qualities.<br /><br />Then consider two of the three tests he passes before the vita-ray/super soldier serum treatment. The first is intelligence. He solves the flag-pole problem and gets the girl. Rodgers is not \\"scientific smart\\" like Reed Richards ([[ASIN:B000I9U8NW Fantastic Four]]) or Howard and Tony Stark ([[ASIN:B003UYV08E Iron Man 2 (Single-Disc Edition)]]). But he is shrewd, wily, and clever, like Samson (the riddles in Judges 14) and Hercules (the Twelve Labors were tests of brains as well as brawn). And he needed to pass \\"the brains\\" test before he became the New Hercules for the New World.<br /><br />The second test clinched the deal. Our 90-pound weakling was the first on the hand grenade. \\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends\\" (John 15:13). And his self-sacrifice was so instinctive! No thought, no doubt, no \\"refusal of the call,\\" just quick action in the right direction.<br /><br />The last test was the one Samson failed, the test of chastity in the face of a buxom vixen. Forget Camelot's \\"Fie on Goodness,\\" this is vintage Tennyson: \\"My strength is as the strength of ten, Because my heart is pure.\\" (Galahad).<br /><br />And I applaud  Marvel for both understanding their own property and also understanding the nature of heroism. Considering the abomination ([[ASIN:B001LM1456 The Incredible Hulk]]) (pun intended) that have been many of the previous hero movies (they still can't get the Punisher right, nor Galactus for that matter), this one was a shot in the arm. And a vita-ray treatment, too.<br /><br />We have all become Captain America.my heart is pure.\\" (Galahad).<br /><br />And I applaud  Marvel for both understanding their own property and also understanding the nature of heroism.

B00006L9ZT|5.0|I have seen many presentations of Der Ring and I'll comment on the costumes.  For those who prefer the costumes to be appropriate to the time of the opera this is it.  The singers are dressed in the heroic tradition,not modern dress. Each character is easily identifiable by the costume and the viewer can readily believe that if these characters were real this is what they would have actually worn.  James Morris is the best Wotan and the final duet between Wotan and Brunhilde in Die Walkure is a heart wrencher. For me. this version of Der Ring is the standard to which I compare all other versions.  Der Ring is easily worth the purchase price.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|There have been many Donna Summer compilation albums over the decades, but ( as of this writing ) this is the best and most complete. If you want a definitive overview of Summer's career, this is the one to get.<br /><br />The basic track line up is very similar to that of the earlier \\"Anthology\\", but replaces some the less well known, non-hit tracks ( such as Donna's cover of \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\"... nice, but not essential ) with some actual hits that were inexplicably left off of the previous release. These include \\"Dinner With Gershwin\\", and \\"Love's About To Change My Heart\\" ( in the rare 7\\" mix, which was never included on a U.S. CD before ). Of course, since this compilation was released before Donna's 2008 album \\"Crayons\\", the single \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" is not included.<br /><br />If you want one comprehensive set covering Donna's career, then this is your best choice.
0439023521|5.0|I was not able to put this book down for a second, as a result I got nothing done and read all day. Unlike many books that I have to force myself to read a couple of chapters before I get in to, this one had me hooked from the first page.;<br /><br />Honestly, I read it reluctantly on a recommendation from my sister.  While this book was written with the \\"young readers\\" market in mind don't make the mistake of thinking it isn't sophisticated enough for adults.

The episodes keep getting knottier and the plot becomes more entangled yet connected in twists and turns, where the adventure, the drama, and the humor spans space and time in ways the continue to amaze and delight.  The last season becomes even more exciting and the twists become even more poignantly powerful and riveting.  The best is yet to come.

I will take a longer time to buy movies now to see if they will come out in 3D later.

Some of the best things I learned from the book are:<br /><br />- When you find something easy that others find difficult ... then you can be valuable to those that need your expertise<br />- When you network offer something of value to the other person<br /><br />Here is what I did not like about it.<br /><br />- SILICON VALLEY STARTUP SUCCESS BIAS: Most of the examples in the book are not only about successful startups, but also about start-up founders or high level start-up executives like Sheryl Sandberg<br />- TECH BIAS: Too much emphasis on the tech industry<br />- BLAND COMMENTS: such as complimenting Chris Yeh's career mission to \\"help interesting people do interesting things\\" ....<br /><br />Numerous studies have shown that acquiring, possessing and continuously upgrading skills in demand is one of the best ways to get ahead in a meritocratic environment like we have in the US. I am not certain that this book communicated this message<br /><br />I highly recommend people read this book, but I hope that readers think critically about what they read in the book.
1439153663|5.0|I am a huge lover of historical fiction, and this book did not disappoint.  I wasn't prepared for how hard it gripped me, I even had to bring it to work to sneak in a little reading when I had a break.  The characters were complex and came to life in this novel.  While it wasn't written perfectly (the show not tell issue) I still was engrossed and would highly recommend it.  I was also intrigued that the author felt these characters really felt these where real stories that were spoken/given to her by real people from that era.

B004ZISVWC|5.0|The buzz around this film means that it is a must see for any serious `world cinema' fan, so I finally got to see it. I was not expecting too much, but was really impressed by this little gem from Norway. It is a dark fantasy told as a mockumentary from `found tapes. It tells of a group of students from Volda College, who have heard about an illegal bear hunter. They decide as part of their project that they will interview him and maybe even get some action shots.<br /><br />They track down Hans (played brilliantly by Norwegian comedian Otto Jespersen) who is less than willing to talk to him. He drives a customised Land Rover that is so beaten up it would get a Vehicle Rectification Notice if my local Constabulary saw it on the road. So the plucky youngsters decide that they will follow him when he goes out at night. What they run into is given away by the title of the film and Hans decides to let them film him and the Fairy Tale Troll hunts as he is sick of the job.<br /><br />What happens along the way is a story of how the group survive whilst tracking down rogue trolls. So is it any good? Well I absolutely loved it, it is done in chronological order as the tapes were found and is supposed to be a `rough cut', so it can jump around, but it adds to the authenticity of the thing that there are so many cuts. Obvious comparisons to `The Blair Witch Project' are fine, but this is way better than that. The special effects are good to amazing and the folklore around trolls is brilliant, we even get all the science as to why they either blow up or turn to stone when exposed to sunlight, and the whole blood of a Christian thing is thrown into the mix too. Add to that the over enthusiastic teen agers, a government conspiracy, some dodgy Polish Painters (Bear killers) and you have a whole smorgasbord of fun and action.<br /><br />Director Andr&eacute; Øvredal has done a brilliant job of getting the most from a relatively unknown cast, and has made a truly original film, So original in fact that Hollywood have already snapped up the remake rights, so see the original first. It is in Norwegian with great sub titles but also has an English dub alternative. Either one you choose this is a brilliant film that shows what a bit of imagination and some talent can do, highly recommended.nal in fact that Hollywood have already snapped up the remake rights, so see the original first.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Well ...as much as I was anticipating to see the movie, I wasn't disappointed by the story itself. It was a good balance of the time it was portrayed in and the acting was just as equal. It hit a home run rounding all three bases of humor,suspense, and sympathy.
B0069SG4W0|5.0|No this one isn't just another reissue of the well known album but also one for the discerning Doors fans and collectors, featuring as it does different versions of 7 of the 10 tunes (exceptions being \\"Hyacinth House\\" (unfortunately as it is a beautiful song), \\"L'America\\" and \\"Crawling King Snake\\") plus the unissued \\"She Smells so Nice\\"/Rock me Baby\\". There's also the image of Morrison crucified on a telegraph pole included with the early original vinyl issue on a poster and on the inner sleeve (referred to here as \\"Electric Woman\\").<br /><br />They were all recorded in The Doors Workshop at the time of the \\"LA Woman\\" sessions (hence the title of the double vinyl edition, \\"The Workshop Sessions\\" (which features only the alternate versions and unissued tunes). The quality of the alternative versions is, as one would expect, excellent of course and I'm surprised that they have never appeared before though that's probably down to the cynical record company penchant for making maximum money off old material (not that I am a cynic myself, you understand).<br /><br />Enough has been said about the original album so I'll concentrate here on the alternative versions. I haven't actually compared any of them to the originals, merely listened to the unreleased ones and said what comes to mind, but I can say with certainty that most of the alternate versions are less polished than those used on the album and, indeed, sound at times like demos at times rather than alternate takes or versions. One does, in fact, mention the take number, which probably means that none of them are actually demos. Studio chat features too.<br /><br />\\"The Changeling\\", which Jim tells the band is his favourite number, is longer at nearly 5 minutes and powers along at around the same speed as the album version but with a different keyboard riff. It is, perhaps, more powerful and certainly bluesier with more raucous lead guitar. A few bum notes slip in but do not spoil the overall feel of the song.<br/><br />\\"Love Her Madly\\" features a lazier Morrison vocal with different lyrics and a totally different keyboard section in the middle.<br /><br />\\"Been Down So Long\\" is probably the least different alternative, much the same as the album version apart from being a bit rougher and longer.<br /><br />The slow, dirty, blues of \\"Cars Hiss by My Window\\" seems to feature somewhat more prominent guitar than the LP version and is 30 seconds longer.<br /><br />\\"LA Woman\\" meanwhile features different lead guitar riffs and a weird bit of extra vocalising brings it to a sudden end at 8.45.<br /><br />\\"The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)\\" features different lyrics and is 1.20 longer than the album version but this comprises a cacophony of jazzy guitar and drums with no discernible tune. There's an instrumental version thrown in too.<br /><br />Clocking in at 2 minutes longer than the original, \\"Riders on the Storm\\" could have been the jewel in the crown here, were it not for the fact that the extra time is occupied by a throw away Morrison ditty, false start and chat occupying the first 2 minutes plus a somewhat flat Morrison vocal, especially evident at the start of the tune proper.<br /><br />Finally, music-wise, you get the addition of an actual unreleased song, \\"She Smells so Nice\\", which morphs into \\"Rock Me\\", but both are pretty much of filler or single B side standard and it`s no wonder they were not used on the \\"LA Woman\\" album proper or indeed anywhere else.<br /><br />As stated earlier this 2 LP 180 gram vinyl version features only the alternative versions spread over 3 sides. The lyrics of the original versions of the alternative songs are etched onto side 4. The gatefold sleeve features a largely white mock up of the \\"LA Woman\\" sleeve with recording details, credits and a replica of the striking image of a naked Morrison crucified on a telegraph pole that came as a poster and on the yellow inner sleeve of early copies the original vinyl LP (mine's in the loft).Though the image is referred to as \\"Electric Woman\\" on a set packaging sticker, I always understood it to be Morrison and it does look like it could be him.<br /><br />For the current price, 3 sides of music in a gatefold sleeve seems like pretty good value. Buy it this way if you still have a record deck and do not want another copy of \\"LA Woman\\" on CD.<br /><br />I fail to understand why the other reviewer gave this 2* rating and inferred Rhino had screwed up again based on the sole comment of a lack of the promised etched image on side 4.  Rhino's Doors screw up was in the £100+ vinyl box issued a couple of years ago and not this.  Just ignore the differing etchings and the 2* rating and enjoy the brilliant music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|No doubt about it, the book is dark with a disturbing premise. The story is a compelling, must-keep-page-turning narration of a girl in a brutal society forced into their equivalent of the Coliseum spectacles of ancient Rome. The themes in The Hunger Games may be emotionally overwhelming for younger children to process, I would not recommend it for any child under 13.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of the female protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. Strong, emotionally numb, resourceful, clumsy with relationships, protective, intelligent and undereducated - a fascinating mix of broken girl and heroine. Rich and compelling, I particularly enjoyed that Collins never broke out into eloquent descriptive prose because the person telling us the story was not a degree-holding English major - she was a serf from district 12 trying to survive. Before the reaping she dreams of living outside of the Capitol's influence, afterwards she dreams of just not looking pathetic when she is killed in the games.<br /><br />Superbly written with something for everyone: action; love story; despair; sorrow; joy; resignation and triumph - it's an emotional roller-coaster that cruelly leaves you hanging at the end (not to worry, the sequel is right here!).<br /><br />The most disturbing aspect of the story was the manifest injustice of Panem society. Strongly resembling that of ancient Sparta, the Panem Capitol, a less populous but technologically superior district, defeated all other districts and put them into a condition of semi-slavery similar to how the Spartans defeated the more populous Messenians and instituted Helotism. The Capitol keeps order by disarming the districts and treating law breakers or any hint of rebellion with beatings and executions just as the Spartans did to the Helots. It's painful at times to read the book and imagine living as Katniss does in such a society, yet we know these societies have existed before for centuries at a time.

B002UM5BXW|4.0|Worked my way through college in a steak/seafood restaurant.  Though I read the book ten years after it was released, it was about the real thing and brought back many memories, and nightmares.  Great reading.  Bourdain's style is real and to the point.  Not for the squeamish, prude, or politically correct types.
B001BANK32|5.0|If there's one horror novel I would not change a word of, it's The Shining. It's a tour de force that still scares the bejezus out of everyone who reads it.<br /><br />The Torrance family are trapped in The Overlook Hotel for winter. For most of us that would mean long boring periods of watching movies on cable TV. For them, it's hell.<br /><br />Danny has a psychic power which somehow increases the intrinsic evil of the hotel itself. And caught between them is his father, Jack.<br /><br />As an unsuccessful alcoholic writer, Jack is like a self-portrait of an alternative version of the author himself (and I was astounded to read in his much later book On Writing that King himself claims he did not realize this until many years later). As the weakest of the three, he's the one the hotel takes over.<br /><br />And much of the power of this is that Jack is at heart a good man. Weak, but good. He took the job to help his family, to try to keep himself away from booze and solve his anger management issues. That he's trapped and subverted by an evil hotel is a tragedy.<br /><br />So this novel has both irony and compassion for all three members of the family.<br /><br />Within ten years King would go over to the side of political correctness. If he wrote this novel today, Jack would have no humanity or redeeming qualities. His wife would kill him to protect Danny and we'd wonder why they ever got married to begin with.
B002E01LL6|5.0|Fight films are not my thing. They have been done and done and done. I mostly watched this film because I just saw Channing Tatum in the Eagle (first time ever for this actor) and thought he did well but was curious to see how he might do in a film with some dramatic potential. He did just fine in Fighting in my opinion and showed much more range (because more range was called for) than in the Eagle. I think he has charisma and a lot of potential for good roles in the future.<br /><br />What surprised me was how good the script was in Fighting and how fresh the acting was of some of the supporting actors. This was more like an indy film than a regular Hollywood or Hong Kong fight film. I especially liked the supporting actor who was a very engaging character.<br /><br />The dialogue was not lofty, but it was realistic and \\"authentic\\" and thus atmospheric. All in all Fighting was a refreshing break from the usual fight films and for me at least, a \\"real film about people\\" and not just genre. Of course in this respect it may be very disappointing for viewers who want genre films that compete to top each other.<br /><br />I will say on the negative side that Tatum was hyped in the film as a fighting white college student, yet he did not fit any stereotype of a college student. This bothered some reviewers and I must say I had to work to remember that a lot of college students in real life actually do not come across as any more sophisticated in manners or speech  than he does. He comes across almost as sort of a bumkin, though with some good sense. This is not truly unrealistic, but it is not close to a stereotype of college students in a serious film. So I won't fault it for this. I watched the Blu Ray and it had minimal extras. Only one deleted scene added much.<br /><br />Well photographed film, and I really liked the portrayal of New York.

B005ERIRZE|5.0|I love the book.  The book explains why we do what we do when we should not do it in a scientific way.  She also applied the science into daily life and I feel that I always can use it on my own life too.  Every chapter, she also offers advices and exercises that helps me realize why I keep doing wrong things and how I can stop it.  Even before I finish the book, I already realize that I can stop myself when I in the middle of something that I should not do.  When I finish the book, I am very clear about how I can stop doing wrong things, enhance my willpower, and keep use what I learned in many different ways.  I also stop feeling guilty about myself, and learned that I, as a normal human being, always have temptations, and resist them is part of life and it doesn't have to be hard.  I strongly recommend the book.
B004ZN9NCY|4.0|Pink Floyd's soundtrack id good, not the best but not the worst. Their '60s albums were overlooked, Ummagumma is also superior to More. It's a semi-instrumental soundtrack. A few songs have vocals but most is instrumental, the other disc is live. Has a few versions of the Syd Barrett-era songs performed live with David Gilmour on Vocals. The instrumental tracks sound unique and original, something different from Pink Floyd. If you're a casual fan than I'd recommend getting into more of their music like Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, Meddle and Animals. If you're really into Pink Floyd already than I'd recommend it. It's very underrated and overlooked.
B005IZNM0W|4.0|I purchased this car as a stocking stuffer for my son.  He loves CARS and didn't have this one.  However, after ordering I saw the same one in Target or Kroger (don't remember) for half the price.  For some reason I was thinking this one was hard to find, but it wasn't .  My advice- shop your local stores.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Hail to the Thief and Amnesiac were slight disappointments, even though they were still good. In Rainbows is more like their older music and it's the closest they've got to making an album similar to OK Computer. More rock than on their last several album mixed with some of their new sounds. In Rainbows is a return to form and it's a good direction for the band, their best since Kid A and one of the best albums of 2008.

B000002U9Y|5.0|Saucerful of Secrets is a more atmospheric, spacier and more psychedelic follow up to Piper at the Dawn. It's not quite a classic but it's still very good and covers a lot of ground. It also has some progressive influences even though the genre wasn't official in 1968, it was still an influence to the progressive genre. The album's less accessible than Piper and it's harder to get into but after several listens it gets better. It's more complex than their debut but it holds up with age very well and the lyrics are better also. It's also their last with Syd Barrett, right before David Gilmour does lead vocals. Jugaband Blues, Corporal Clegg and Let There Be More Light are some of their finest songs to date. Overall, it's not as much of a classic as Piper at The Gates Of Dawn and it's a bit short in amount of songs but it's still up to standards.
B0059XTUB8|1.0|This film meanders on with no real intent.  It is difficult to be engaged with what is an uninteresting storyline.<br /><br />The only saving grace is the superb acting of Michelle Williams.  Otherwise a very dull and unimpressive movie.
B000A1SZ2Y|4.0|This Super Macro Lens is great, but I think it is heavy for my powershot SX20 lens (whith a 58mm filter adapter and UV filter).<br />The pictures are awesome, but you need an Image Stacking Software to get a perfect focused image
B004JRVQX0|2.0|Yes, my title says what I sincerely mean. For example, iLok.com states they've been working on making their sync service compatible with FireFox 4 and 5....for over a year now. iLok.com has poor performance being able to identify the iLok dongle. By this lacking, I dare not call tech support. If the development team can't figure out these issues, how do you expect the support team to know your fix?<br /><br />More, iLok made it easy for software developers to \\"bundle\\" in their installers, but alas, this was a terrible mistake, as Waves.com apparently found. Since iLok.com will only work with the latest Helper software, you must juggle versions to get a program to install, which bundles iLok installation with it. For example, I bought Drumagog5. It installed fine, but bundled in the iLok driver software. After doing that, the next time I tried downloading new licenses to the iLok, iLok.com said the version of iLok software I had was not the latest, and required me to upgrade (after Drumagog's bundled iLok software downgraded it to an older version). iLok software should never be bundled with other installers, and if iLok or PACE encouraged it before, then they are responsible for this failure---or lack of foresight.<br /><br />What I see is a careless effort to maintain an OK product, which seems somewhat reliable, but I feel iLok rests on their laurels, and hasn't figured out how to actually make iLok.com fully compatible with your latest browsers. Why should FireFox retain version 3 because of the laziness of another company?<br /><br />Note to iLok: \\"Get with the program!\\" Evolution is slow. So are you.
B00127RAJY|5.0|So I must say I am 23 years old, 6'4\\" tall, female and obese. I have been an athlete my whole life but after finishing college I let myself go. I started weight watchers and was trying to find a DVD I could do at home. I found this DVD at big lots for $5 I was very excited, I ran home and started the DVD and did level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 10 days and level 3 for 10 days. I was absolutely drenched each and every day; I think I only took 2 days off in the 30 days which probably was very healthy. I lost 19.2 lbs in 30 days!!!! I HIGHLYYY HIGHLYY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE all shapes, sizes and ages! :)

B0015AARJI|1.0|These controllers are absolute garbage.  The original controller that came with my PS3 that I bought years ago lasted for a few years.  I've bought 3 in the last 2 years, 2 of them have already given out.  On one of controllers, it just starts pressing buttons randomly for me.  On the other one, the R1 already gave out - this one I had for 6 months.  4 controllers, 3 crapped out, only 1 lasted more than 1 year.<br /><br />Horrible quality control by Sony.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|A great story of intricacies of interpersonal relationships in love, family, and courtship. This book really shows the way of life in the earlier centuries. There is everything that makes it a good exciting story and flows in such a way that it always keeps your interest.
B006ANJ4BW|5.0|All I can say is that this movie portrays the Conan character the way it should be!  I enjoyed the previous Conan movies by Arnold Schwarzenegger , but I don't feel they caught the essence of the character.  At least, not as written in Robert E. Howard's literary works or in the stories written by Marvel or Dark Horse Comics. To date, Jason Momoa's characterization has come closest to this.<br /><br />There are some things in the movie that could have been done differently, but like any movie, if you watch it without any pre-expectations you will enjoy it more.
0525478817|5.0|With such an amazing title and simple cover, I wasn't sure what to make of John Green's The Fault in Our Stars. What I uncovered was a book that I can't really explain with any great justice. It was a book that overwhelmed me with emotions and a book I simply could not put down. Quite simply, it was one of the best, if not the best book I have read in a long time.<br /><br />Hazel has cancer. She can tell you more about the particulars, but basically she is cancer. She isn't fighting a battle with cancer, she is made of cancer and her cancer is made of her. She stopped going to school years ago and got her GED, but she goes to Community College, which is her only real interaction with people other than her parents. Her mother wants her to have a normal(ish) life, so she encourages (makes) Hazel go to a cancer support group. At the support group, Hazel watches a revolving door of cancer people come and go (and by go, she means \\"from this earth\\"). What she didn't expect to happen on this particular day was that she would meet Augustus, a boy who lost his leg to cancer.<br /><br />Augustus is that rare individual who transforms every life he touches, but he does so in such an unassuming way, you can't help but absolutely love him. As he and Hazel get to know each other, she reveals her favorite book. An Infinite Affliction is about a young girl dying of cancer, but it is real. It isn't the type of book to romanticize the disease or create martyrs of innocent children because of the disease, but instead it tells the truth of it all, scary parts, sad parts, horrible parts and all. And then it ends. mid-sentence, it just ends. Whether because the girl died or was too weak to continue, it just ends. Hazel shares this story with Augustus, and neither of them can stop thinking of what happened to the people the girl left behind. Hazel has tried to contact the author before, but she was never as determined or crafty as Augustus. With his ability to charm himself in or out of anything, Augustus finds the reclusive author and manages an invite to go to Amsterdam and meet him. Although Hazel spent her one Wish (the wish given to dying kids because adults can't bear to see them die) years ago when she thought she was dying, Augustus has never spent his, until now. Although the trip to Amsterdam is crazy, whimsical, and inherently dangerous for a girl whose lungs are intent upon drowning, they go on the adventure that will make their short lives full to the brim. It isn't exactly what you would expect, but it was a Wish that was granted in some strange and life-altering ways.<br /><br />I am not sure how to describe this book because it really affected me in so many ways, so I will describe the emotions it made me experience. I was angry, so very angry. I was angry for Hazel and her swimming lungs, Augustus and the fact that cancer could hurt a boy who was so simply wonderful, for Isaac who lost both his eyes to cancer (and subsequently his girlfriend). I was heartbroken when Hazel worries that she is a \\"grenade\\" who will scatter shrapnel into everyone's lives she touches and scar them forever. I was happy, beyond happy, to watch Augustus take Hazel's life, much of which was filled with not living, but rather going through the motions, and make her live, love, hurt, breathe, and live again. I cried because of the poetic ending, and I laughed at Augustus' and his way of making you laugh even when you should be crying (or sobbing). But even now, I experience a feeling that doesn't really have a name. It is the feeling in your gut and in your throat you get when you remember a book or movie or song that has affected you so deeply, you want to pick it up and start all over again. It is the feeling that you get when you think about that book or movie or song that makes you smile and brings tears to your eyes at the same time.<br /><br />I loved this book. I can't tell you enough just how much I loved this book. John Green is not only a master, but he is an author who has the ability to change your life. This is a sad book, as its premise clearly tells you, but it is beautiful and happy as well. Don't discount this book as depressing or \\"too much\\" for a student, because it isn't. Sometimes I am skeptical about giving a book with a premise such as this to a kid who has experienced loss or grief, but this book would actually help a child who has lived through such a tragedy. It doesn't romanticize the illness, it just tells it like it is. At one point Augustus talks about wanting to leave a legacy when he is gone and Hazel disagrees with him. She just wants to live, live normally. She doesn't need to shape the world, she just wants to make it to her next birthday (which her family counts in half birthdays because a year is too long to wait for). The candidness of this book will affect you deeply, I warn you, but you will be better for it. So give it to everyone who will read it, young adult, (not so young) adult, ill, not so ill, anyone who will read it. Why? Because when you read a book like The Fault in Our Stars, you have to share it.t he is an author who has the ability to change your life.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|The movie moves in a slow stealthy way but is never for a moment dull. On the contrary it creates unreal decibels of tension and suspense with an element of the surreal almost if not for the very real levels of menace and violence that venture in to shatter the deadly calm from time to time.  Drive is a very good film on many levels.  The lead character is very interesting to watch. The cinematography borders on the Kubrick-ian at times and to great effect.  Finally, more impressive than the special effects gore that accompanies the violence is the threat of violence which creates the movie's suspense.  Add to that some very good driving/chase scenes and its not hard to see why this movie has its appeal.  Perhaps the only drawback for me besides the annoying theme song \\"Real human being\\" (we need a theme song to remind us the guy is a hero and a nice guy?) is the ending which somehow doesn't have as much punch as the movie leading up to it. The movie doesn't end on a satisfying note and perhaps its to be expected in a noir thiller such as this movie.  I kind of stopped beleiving in his relationship to the girl by the end..  The violence/gore special effects seems a bit over the top by the end as well.  No matter, I still enjoyed the 90% of the movie leading up to the end and would EASILY recommend this as a great thriller/hot rod movie.  For other movies in the genre also check out the Tarantino favorite \\"Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry\\" and \\"The Driver\\" (on which, by the way, this movie seems somewhat based upon).  In spite of my criticisms, Drive is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Ryan Gosling is a talent to be reckoned with.
0525478817|3.0|Some vague spoilers. No names mentioned.<br /><br />I love John Green. I think he's a very talented YA author and writes great books that teens can readily identify with.<br /><br />There are merits to directly pinpointing and taking pains to explore an emotion. It's a teenage impulse to really nail down what you are feeling and give it meaning. John Green is great at this, so his books are both comforting and exciting. And while it makes for a lot of great quotes and makes it easy for kids to identify with, teens feel enough already. You don't have to explain that much. Clear cut emotional writing is often good writing...but rarely great writing. Then again, I'm not faulting John Green for not writing Catcher in the Rye - that's ridiculous. But some subtlety in emotion can make for a book that people self identify with. It's like the rule \\"show, don't tell.\\"<br /><br />All that said, his books rock. They are great modern novels that help teens cope with being teens, which is a hard thing to do. He's great at tragic characters, adventures, roadtrips, et cetera. The problem with TFOS is that it's not a wacky coming-of-age novel. It builds up characters that you love and then leads them to their inevitable, depressing demise. Tragedy needs another element, other than tragedy. Emotional arc is hard enough without giving all of your main characters terminal illnesses.<br /><br />I'm not saying it isn't a great book. I read it in one sitting and cried my eyes out. But it left me feeling hollow, not the hopefulness that was intended. I think to really get the message of hope across, and to write this book the way John Green really wanted it written, it needed more. John Green is an excellent writer, but he does not have a deft enough hand to create more layers in this story. Kill you characters, by all means, but have some respect for the reader. As is, it's a well-told story of tragedy that imparts little else as a \\"greater meaning.\\"<br /><br />My respect for John Greenas a writer has not been lessened by reading this book, but I do think it highlighted one limit of his talent.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Since buying this Blu Ray as soon as it came out, I've watched it at least 6 times. Phantom has mesmorized me since I first saw it on Broadway so many years ago. I own the dvd and the Blu Ray copies of the movie. I've seen the play 3 times. If you are like me and you feel the phantom's pain of love lost (hell, love he never knew), you must buy this version!!! This is by far the best telling of the true love story of the The Phantom of the Opera. I dare anyone to stay dry eyed at the very end. Sierra Boggess is by far the best Christine I've seen, trumping Sarah by far. You see and feel the torment in her soul as she actually senses the sorrow that is the Phantom's life. You see it in her eyes. Simply, she is fantastic. The director's interpretation of the last scene will tear at your heart. You will feel the Phantom's sadness deeply, but, for the first time, feel the sorrow that is Christine's. Absolutely Perfect. Please, for all of you that have rooted for the Phantom, buy this 25th anniversary Blu ray, worth every cent. Because it alone can make your song take flight, it's truly, the music of the night. Thank you Andrew. Thank you Nick. Thank you Sierra. Thank you Ramin.

0691152640|5.0|Some of the reviewers expressed their disappointment that this book does not provide more insight and deeper understanding of interactions and causalities etc. But I think we have to see where we come from in understanding crises and their patterns. And here ' This Time is Different' provides a giant (and sobering) step forward. Politicians may still be more inclined to to believe in the invincibility of modern monetary institutions and be tempted allow over-leveraging of banks and bail them out in the end. If the authors' recommendation is heeded that the IMF collect reliable and comprehensive statistics on government debt and if an international financial regulator can be established (two big ifs) maybe at least some early indicators will be in place. And we as electorate should at least be able to look beyond the claim that ' This Time is Different'  after reading this excellent book. For me this is one of the ten or twenty books that help to understand the modern world.
0307477479|4.0|I really enjoyed listening to the audio version of this book; the reader was quite excellent.  I loved the life and personality she brought to the prose.  The prose itself is smart and evocative, edgy but compassionate.  I could easily picture the characters and situations.  Benny Salazar was an interesting character who moved through many pieces of this disjointed tale through the lives and times of quite a few people, ending up around the year 2020.  Many of the characters were somehow involved in the music industry, many were involved with drugs, most or all were self-destructive to some extent or were closely affiliated with self-destructive people (which is also self-destructive).  It's not the kind of story you could say has an exact plot or beginning and ending.  It's more a conglomeration of people living overlapping lives with varying degree of success, with Life and Time as the goons, getting in the way bigtime.  Music and technology also played their influential roles.  In many reviews I read, people were put out by the lack of exact plot and by the plethora of characters.  But life is exactly like that, isn't it?  Too little plot, too many characters, and life and time beat us up.  Great story!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|All the one star reviewers can keep their Transformers and Fast Five movies... although adequate popcorn fluff none of those movies reach the tension, mood, and power of Drive. Drive reminds me of live action Japanese anime, the style and depth is beautiful. Contrary to the reviews the movie has a great score. Gosling is awesome, most complex action star you will see all year. He is also brutal, the quiet and cunning badass who will kill you if it means protecting what he loves and cares for...in a most brutal fashion. Albert Brooks plays a bad guy???? really??? But seriously he is pretty cool, think of brooks as Billy Crystal's menacing brother, he loves his knives.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|The basic premise to this movie is a married father of two girls wife gets seriously injured in a boating accident. As she lays in a coma he finds out she had an affair.<br /><br />The problem is the father is a weak man. He is a horrible father. His two daughters are wild, out of control, foul, filthy mouthed brats that he blames on his wife's medical condition. He isn't a good husband from what we are told. Yes he provides the house and material things but we learn his wife fell in love with another man. Is that his fault? Well we are led to believe that. He doesn't get along with his relatives. There is in-fighting on what to do with inherited land.  This same situation puts a rift between him and his neighbors too. He doesn't really have any friends. We see his wife's friends but not his. He even has to go pry out of a couple of them that his wife is indeed been having an affair and that she was going to divorce him. And in the end he has to murder his wife by \\"pulling the plug\\" as they say. So who wants to watch a movie about such a person? I don't. I saw a review that said that this movie was depressing. It isn't so much as depressing as it is icky. It is uncomfortable watching the, now, proverbial train wreck in front of you.<br /><br />It isn't even sad. I mean it is sad in watching what appears to be common in America--immature parents raising out of control kids that mess up society forcing their dysfunctionalism on the rest of us. That is sad. But it is not sad in a tear jerker way. I suspect, for me, that the entire reason is not the weak characters we are watching but that George Looney is simply not a good actor in  my eyes> I think he is another born into stardom actor who can do a better job than say Madonna  or Princess Stephanie so he stays around. But in every movie I saw that he happened to be in he just stands around reading lines out loud half heartedly with the same mannerisms. In the movie he can't even pull off the \\"I'm so cool and goodlooking\\" mannerisms as he looks old (his age) and almost like a puffy faced drunk.<br /><br />If all of this is not reason enough to pass on paying 3.99 for a VOD rental then if you are like me you would want to know the liberal propaganda the movie spews. There is the native Hawaiian subtexts. Research that and find out what radicals float in those circles. I mean why not just have a movie set in Hawaii? It is everywhere in this movie down to the cheesy Don Ho (spelling?) songs . . . scratch \\"cheesy\\" . . . read annoying. There is the capitalism vs environmentalists issue that we hear daily on a national political level starting in 2009 to 2012. There is the anti-bullying stuff we hear in the news where kids are set up to be perpetual victims. Etc etc etc. The profanity is not just your typical curse word here and there. This is some vile language and what is disturbing is it was almost always the kid characters saying this stuff. The male teenage kid who acts, looks, and talks like a pot head and just as matter of factly comments on it.<br /><br />Weak characters. Weak political arguments/minds at play behind this movie. Weak movie.  Glad I only spent $4 and not $12 at the theatre.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read every book S. King has written.  Each book tops the prior book.  This book is sensational!  Well thought out to each and every detail.  Believable.  Entertaining.

B0067LXQAW|5.0|I own 30+ Cranberries CDs and I've attended numerous Cranberries concerts on multiple continents ... I think this new CD is a great addition to their discography! I would rank this new album in the class of their 4th/5th albums (higher than 3rd but lower than 1st/2nd), providing an amalgam of new songs reminiscent of the different periods of their music through the 1990s and early 2000s (including the recent solo career of vocalist Dolores O'Riordan). In particular, there are no songs I'm tempted to skip (like I'm tempted occasionally by their 3rd-5th albums). I've listened to this album more than a dozen times, the songs are generally \\"slow\\" and \\"quiet\\" but there are exceptions (for example my favorite \\"Show Me\\"). The songs are unmistakably from the Cranberries, offering fresh takes on their unique sound. My wife, not a particular Cranberries fan, took one listen and said, \\"Yep, that's definitely the Cranberries.\\" Highly recommended!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I came across a recommendation for the Wool Omnibus edition through some literary people I follow on Twitter, which goes to show the power of both Twitter and the kind of great writing Hugh Howey presents in his thrilling, gripping and very satisfying collection of Wool stories.  The story could have easily fallen into tried and true tropes regarding post-apocalyptic sci-fi, but instead the reader is presented with a careful unveiling of plot that demonstrates the great potential new authors can bring to this genre.  Easily a worthy purchase.

B0061JPYX2|3.0|I enjoyed this cd because I'm a fan and there was 1 song or 2 for which I didnt have a copy, specifically, Song for You. But it is clear these are not the final takes or versions for the general public. Her other cds do her songs better justice, this is just one to add to your collection if you happen to have one.

B005WTR4ZI|4.0|The contents of this short book are not new. They have been discussed to death by economists, technologists et al. In fact, it is clear that the authors have collected the takeaways from other works and condensed them into this book. This fact, however, does not diminish the importance of what this book tell us. The facts in it are unambiguous and allow readers to understand the bigger picture around the man-machine conflict. I was not particularly impressed with the recommendations though. They seem like simple black and white arguments which, unfortunately, do not work in our complex times.

Rihanna....Rihanna...<br /><br />Where are you....?<br /><br />This cd feels empty - rushed - incomplete...<br /><br />Ever since the \\"Chris Brown\\" incident you feel the need to proclaim to the world.. You are a \\"BAD\\" Girl.. I understand the need for artists to show growth, but it seems like you took one or two step backwards.<br /><br />After hearing.. Take A Bow.. I thought to myself.. Rihanna is preparing her fans for something UNFORGETTABLE... I'm still waiting..<br /><br />The music on this cd is catchy and people will dance to it in the club.. *thinking to myself* - \\"People will dance to anything when they are drunk\\".. well back to the cd..<br /><br />1. You Da One - is my favorite track on this cd... I can listen to this song over and over<br /><br />2. We All Want Love - is another favorite song of mine...<br /><br />3. Talk That Talk - is an okay song to me.. nothing to write home to mom about.. Even Jay-Z's rap is weak..<br /><br />The other songs on the cd are forgettable....<br /><br />Take it from me.. The whole SEX thing gets old..<br /><br />I don't think 10 years from now.. someone will be singing.. CAKE CAKE CAKE CAKE<br /><br />There's only so much grinding & popping you can do in your videos before people get tired.. Ask Ciara.. Better yet ask Janet Jackson... when she started getting freakier and naked in videos - her record sales went down which each cd she released... The public loves Janet.. but they aren't buying her music...<br /><br />Take a vacation... Do some Soul Searching... and Bring your fans some HEARTFELT MUSIC..
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always love playing solitaire and now that I have it on my kindle, I can play anywhere anytime, plus its FREE! can't go wrong with that
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best game ever its so fun to play that I cantvstop but I think you should add little more info about the games you r about to buy.
034552554X|5.0|Wow, what a story. Super writing, intertwining two stories of the central character at different stages of her life. A friend had told me about this book and I was worried that it may be aimed at a female audience but i found it compelling and appealing. At times you will be frustrated but, in the end, the fact that the characters are all flawed makes it more believable and interesting. Treat yourself and buy this book, settle down, relax and enjoy. You won't regret it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I first purchased a really cute lime green sleeve for my Kindle Fire, but I found that it defeated the purpose of having such a slim, light e-reader -- with the sleeve on, the Fire wouldn't fit in my (relatively small) purse, plus just felt bulky when I carried it around, plus I hated pulling it in and out of the sleeve.<br /><br />So, even though I read all the mixed reviews here, I went ahead and purchased this cover -- and I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />It is *VERY* light, so I don't mind that it's made with plastic.  The stand works just fine for me; I've never had trouble with it (maybe they improved the \\"groove\\" after the earlier critical reviews?).  I can easily access the on/off button, but I have never accidentally pressed it. There are openings at the top of the cover so that the speakers aren't muffled. And the cover is so slender that it adds almost no bulk at all (fits in my purse!).<br /><br />I have had no peeling, and I carry my Kindle Fire with me everywhere and use it all the time.<br /><br />My only minor criticism is that the sort of furry part (which comes in contact with the screen when closed) does gather fuzz ... but it's easy to brush off, and worth the trouble to keep the screen scratch-free.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Recommended by my daughter, who happens to be married to a car fiend. ;-) Love the canine viewpoint! Very comfortable and quick read, and learned a lot about cars, attitudes of 'car people', etc. Would definitely recommend.
B000P1QMZ6|5.0|I along with a lot of people I know felt we had the complete series by buying the 8 disc \\"complete Harry Potter Collection\\" but I felt the need to get this DVD to complete my collection, and now I am the only person I know with all 8 movies AND the not sold in the USA Philosopher's Stone! I will cherish this movie forever!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the Kindle app and books. We own a Kindle and several Android Devices.<br /><br />It is so convenient to be able to switch from one to the other and not lose your place.<br /><br />I read on my 10\\" tablet and would love to see a two page, side by side view for tablets. Perhaps that will come once Amazon starts selling a 10\\" tablet...
B005LY4B0A|4.0|This is such a fun little game.  The little bugs and the sounds they make are adorable.  My kids love it too!
B006JJBFK0|5.0|As much as I adore Imaginaerium, when I heard this CD, I was blown away.  I have really liked all of Xandria's stuff, but this new singer and her reflection of Nightwish era Tarja are just incredible.  This is definitely Xandria's best effort yet, and if this WERE Nightwish and Tarja, it would be a top pick for them too.  There is not an iffy track on the CD.  B
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game runs smooth, and is super fun to play. Most games run slow on my phone, which is why I was so happy to see that this game ran fast. I think this is a game everyone can enjoy. Good work.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Another great one by S. King.  I quickly found myself lost in the story. Don't be intimidated by the length!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Mile 81 took me back to the early books of Stephen King.  To those totally fantasy terror novels that your mind tells you can't exist and yet...
1606865617|1.0|I tried to read this book three different times. The furthest page I have reached is 100 and I gave up. I just don't care about these characters and it's hard to keep track of who the characters are. I was constantly trying to figure out who a character was and then all of a sudden a new character comes into the picture and I honestly didn't see what their relevance was.<br /><br />This book is just boring. Yes, there was some good imagery, although I wouldn't call it \\"amazing\\" like some of the other reviewers do. I'm actually surprised to read that from some readers. I feel like I read a completely different book.<br /><br />Anyway, I feel like I wasted my time with this book. I will not attempt to finish it.
B0027GGL6W|5.0|I loved this film! Etta James was one of my favorite artists and Beyonce's far from being the Etta James type, but I really enjoyed her in this role! It's a great story and the artist's shown were a major foundation of Rock  N' Roll!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really fun and challenging game. my kids love to play the game. I would pay for it.
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|Gives you a top level overview. Not much detail, its useless if you're a programmer.<br /><br />There are videos on youtube that give you a better idea in less time though.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|From director Tarsem Singh (The Cell) comes Immortals, a visual dynamo of a film that offers little to nothing else.  Henry Cavill (from The Tudors and soon to be seen as the new Superman) is Theseus; a mortal man chosen by Zeus (Luke Evans) to stop the evil King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) from finding a mythical bow used for unleashing the mythical Titans and laying waste to the rest of the world.  Along for the ride are a thief (Stephen Dorff) and an oracle (Freida Pinto) as Theseus fights and flexes his way across the screen, with blood and swordplay being the order of the day.  Much like The Cell, Immortals is a visual feast that features amazing technical achievements while offering little in the way of story or character development.  Not to mention the fact that there are so many plot holes and inconsistencies along the way that you'll be hard pressed keeping track of everything going on.  The film's battle and fight scenes are good, but there are too many slow moments that bog up the pace and as a result Immortals feels uneven.  Cavill does little to prove himself leading man material, as the rest of the cast (including John Hurt, Alan Van Sprang, Isabel Lucas, and Kellan Lutz) pretty much phones it in, but it's Mickey Rourke that manages to leave a lasting impression in an otherwise mediocre affair.  All in all, Immortals is visually appealing, and little else.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This dvd has really grown on me more than I thought it would. I haven't had the best results with this program but it's a really great one still.<br /><br />To me I'd suggest trying this dvd out to prepare you for Insanity if you are considering that one. It has similar work outs but on an easier level. I couldn't imagine just jumping in to Insanity !<br /><br />Jillian isn't super annoying but I have a difficult time listening to the same music and know what she's going to say word for word. Instead, I mute her and put on some upbeat music, it makes it go by so much quicker !<br /><br />I agree, there are only 3 work outs to choose from and that is no fun.<br /><br />This dvd is worth the price you pay, though.
B007BDK3SS|4.0|the game is great but there's a few levels that are almost impossible and you can do mono rail with the back tire lop though its still a really fun game (other then frustrating) but i really like good job!
0307346617|4.0|I am way behind in reading this book. The furor has passed, at least until later this year when the buzz about the movie's 2013 release gets into full swing and we undoubtedly get a reprint with a still from the movie on the cover. I am not sad about that because I think that despite its slow start, World War Z is a damn good book. Like Alden Bell's The Angels are the Reapers, World War Z is a surprising and compelling read. I wasn't prepared to like the book as much as I did.<br /><br />World War Z is the thinking man's zombie narrative. Brooks does a marvelous job of incorporating class, economic, cultural, and political considerations into the narrative, creating a richness of story that engages the heart and the mind. It is a global story and Brooks constructs the world and events around the recognizable. Existing national conflicts, PTSD, survivor guilt, fanaticism, capitalism, truth, lies, and the \\"let's blame it on Africa\\" game all get equal time. Human behavior is the highlight of the story, the zombies are almost negligible, a MacGuffin, if you will. To put it very simply, the true heart of this story is the people. The way that they respond in crises, how they respond to each other, how they survive. World War Z doesn't shy away from the evil things that men do, the greed and the selfishness. It also does not shy away from the goodness and the self-sacrifice. It does a really good job of avoiding caricatures, instead allowing the characters to be flawed, multifaceted, and deeply affected by the novel's events. The good and the bad collide and, like with any true community event, the perspectives and what they mean are ever changing.<br /><br />I was initially put off by the first person POV, (the narrative is constructed as a UN report and written interview style)but again, it works. In fact, it works with astounding success. The voices are very individual. Another thing that I really loved about this book is the way that Brooks identifies and stresses thefact that the human story is a global story. For better or worse. A great read and I can't recommend it enough.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Ran great the first time on my Transformer.  Since then it froze and now won't start back up, just goes black.  Even after reboot.
B003BLPTB0|1.0|I just received my Crocs with a nasty surprise, the right one came with a clean cut in the toe strap, made with a sharp blade or something like that.<br /><br />I guess the cut was made unintentionally by the guy that opens the boxes in which they come from China. I also guess that is why some boxes have the legend \\"DO NOT CUT WITH SHARP INSTRUMENT\\" printed on them. Maybe this guy doesn't read very well ...<br /><br />I know that -in general terms-, this is a very good product and this situation should happen one in a million times but, ¿Why it has to be precisely with my Crocs?<br /><br />Bad luck I guess ...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|one of the best games ever. everyone should get it. the birthday world is really hard and annoying. get it.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Generic metal riffs, clunky, rhythmically stunted drumming combined with vocals that sound as though Lou recorded them without listening to the backing tracks don't add up to a worthwhile or enjoyable listening experience. The lyrics are often embarrassing too. \\"Breezes\\" rhymed with \\"treezes\\", \\"I am the table\\"?!? come on dammit.<br /><br />I don't fault Lou Reed and Metallic for trying something new and confound fan expectations by breaking out of the box. However neither party brought their A game to this failure. James, Kirk and Robert serve up a platter of 3rd rate repetitive metal riffs while Lars pummels his drums with all the creativity of a chimp. Unfortunately I don't think they're capable of breaking out of their particular box. It doesn't sound as though they tried very hard either. Lou Reed is a different case. But on Lulu he sounds disengaged and his lyrics are not among his best. This is a supposed concept album about a young girl who becomes a prostitute but after reading the lyrics I found it hard to grasp the concept or actually care. Perhaps if I saw the play the music would make more sense contextually. But even so there are bigger problems with Lulu. The music and vocals don't add up to a synergistic whole. They fight each other the entire time. Which makes Lulu a failure emotionally, intellectually, and musically. I'm afraid that Metallica and Lou Reed simply don't work well together. Not every collaboration works.<br /><br />Btw I can't wait for the new Cher/Cannibal Corpse project. I hear that one is really going to rock!
0743270754|5.0|This is an excellent book about an amazing group of people selected by the greatest American president.  This group included the three rivals to Lincoln for the 1860 Republican Party nomination for president, Seward, Chase and Bates.  Later on Stanton was added to this group and arguably became the most important as Secretary of War.  This group biography of the cabinet during the secession crisis and then civil war is full of fascinating vignettes about people and events.  Though set during the war there is little military history; this book is about people and their reactions to events.  As the generals consistently showed incompetence and disloyalty to the cause Lincoln becomes more and more important to the running of the war until he finally finds a fighting general in Grant.  The book highlights for me, once again, the genius of Lincoln and his almost saintly personality.  Long at almost 800 pages you find yourself hating for it to end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great game to pass the time away. I give this game five stars. I've played this game since I was a kid. it is goof to. have it on my kindle firs.

B00000IQV7|5.0|The world needed Robin Williams to come along for the many different roles that he has stared in and this is yet another one. This is a billant story about the way that governments and hostpitals in general don't really know what they are doing.<br />And the fact that it is a true story only goes to proof what I say and I am speaking from my own experiences, a must watch film.<br /><br />Cheers. Rick.
B003Y5H5AQ|4.0|Not in 3D my mistake good movie for the little one to watch very funny it can be for the whole family
B00008L3U1|5.0|Yet another one of Robin Williams classic movies, once again funny but actually about a very sad illness that Jack has. I think that Jack acceptance speech at the end of the movie sums up life in general. A must watch film along with the Bi-Centennial Man also with Robin acting extremely well yet again.<br /><br />Cheers. Rick.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love this book. It is interesting and keeps you wanting to read more. I was never bored through out the entire book. The characters personalities and the way the book was written, makes it easy for you to imagine and for the characters to come alive.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's not too bad, but it would be nice if you didn't need so many coins to unlock games, most of which aren't that interesting. but there's. a lot of games!
B001R0LOES|1.0|Looks like I am not the only one who was unable to watch this movie on amazon prime. Half hour to see the first five minutes TWICE.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game only starts you out with ten games at first. Then you have to earn points to unlock the other games. Like my title says its ok but not the best to me.
B001E75QH0|5.0|Great movies!  I love the entire collection!  Not much to say that the quality is great.  sound is good and picture quality is good.  I watch them all the time.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|after I bought this app I tried at least ten times to install it with no success. it might just be that a kindle fire doesn't have a gps, but other reveiws said it worked just fine on their KF. I'm confused.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|does not work with galaxy nexus freezes and will not work until force close. 15 16 17 18 19 20
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|This is only the dumbest movie ever and that is saying a lot after having watched the original. The original Conan should win an Oscar compared to this turd. No redeeming qualities whatsoever.
B005HSL626|5.0|first I would like to say I love this game is so fun I got it for my kindle. if you came home from school it's so fun
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use this to remote monitor my security system and it works quite well. I just wish it supported more than one simultaneous login.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire was definitely a worthy sequel to The Hunger Games. The book has most of the surviving characters from The Hunger Games in it, along with a few new characters that the reader will find impossible not to love. There were several plot twists and turns which kept the book interesting and kept me awake reading until early in the morning trying to find out what happens next. Suzanne Collins writes a very shocking plot twist, and just when you think nothing else shocking is going to happen because she can't trump that one, she throws in another even more shocking twist to shake things up. I think my favorite controversial moment in the book is when Cinna makes Katniss' dress for her interview. I must admit, the ending of Catching Fire made me so mad, I wanted to throw it against a wall. I was completely dumbfounded and never saw it coming. I can't wait to get my hands on the final book in the trilogy, Mockingjay, and find out what happens next.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I am really enjoying this game, it is simple but challenging. I am in my 40s and my son is 9, and both of us are having fun trying to beat each others time.

1469984202|5.0|Short and sweet review...this is easily one of the best books I've read in awhile. It's fresh, well written, and a book I just couldn't put down. I've lost plenty of sleep this week from reading it well past when I should have already been in bed. I'm glad it's gotten so many good reviews or else I might have skimmed over it and totally missed out. The only thing I wish is that there were more books on the horizon.
B007BDK3SS|1.0|this game is too hard, believe me it seems fun at first then you start to tell that you cant beat it. noooooo pleaaase don't purchase this app, it horrible
B001I511TU|2.0|The book was rated as very good by the seller with a slightly bent and creased spine.  The book is readable, and I think all of the pages are there, but it looks like it was an original from the 1970's.  The pages are yellow/orange.  Not just around the edges, but the whole page.  I bought it as a gift, but will not send it.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this game was really fun for me to play. works great on kindle fire, had no problems with it! this game is probably best for ages 7-13 (if seven year olds have kindle fires) definitely a good way to pass time.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is very nice. Attractive. Very good quality. The nicest cover I've seen. Looks like an antique book. Definitely recommend, if this fits your style.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Halfway through the book, a funny thing happened. I was sucked in. It wasn't due to the BDSM elements because to tell you the truth, I thought it was light in that arena. It also wasn't due to its erotic love scenes, because there wasn't anything original about them and to me, they fell short of what I deem erotica. It wasn't due to my loving the characters because I didn't find either Christian or Anastasia likeable. So what then, kept me reading? Find out at- [...]

0385344228|4.0|Wow! Oh, wow! Get ready for a ride. An assistant district attorney's sidelined when his son is arrested for a local murder. This story doesn't keep the reader guessing, it blindsides us.
0525478817|3.0|I loved this book when I started it. It instantly had my attention because it felt like it was in the same vein as \\"It's Kind of a Funny Story\\" and \\"50/50\\". Mind you, this is the first John Green book I've read. But for a book that seemingly seeks to kill the typical-cancer-book-stereotype, it just barely succeeds. It's not a bad book but a lot of it is ridiculously predictable. The characters are a little flat, their attempts at charm come off as pretentious and there are some situations that are just so improbable that they're annoying to read (Peter Van Houten in the second and completely unnecessary third act). I'm not bashing the book. It's a mildly interesting read that I personally find overrated.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|That's right and great!!!<br />I sure have it made, between my robomaid and my swivel sweeper,house cleaning is a total restful breeze.<br />THANK YOU AMAZON.COM for your prompt and reliable shipping.
1612130283|4.0|I have read the reviews and am amazed that so many people are clueless as to the origins of this story.<br />The original story Master of the Universe was based off of the characters of Twilight Edward and Isabella and the description of some of his mannerisms is based of a real live human Robert Pattinson. The author was another fangirl of the actor and the saga.<br />If you are not a twilight fan and you are repulsed by the whole Twilight genre then you wont even begin to understand this relationship, or where this author is coming from. Yes she changed the names for legal reasons but that isn't going to change the characters they were built from and will only confuse most even more.<br /><br />This is a classic Edward/Bella fanfiction written about their unrealistic love. They fall so hard and its so deep that NO one can ever understand that kind of love because they are human and this kind of love isn't realistic when both are human to an average outsider.<br />Edward was originally a vampire in Twilight and had no sexual experience for over a hundred and nine years and when he meets Bella and falls its VAMPIRE love that you are witnessing. NOT human love. It is fiction people it isn't real and I am surprised that men are expecting this awesome story when deep down its just another harlequin romance novel without the har.<br /><br />You can call the characters TOM and JERRY and you will still never understand the true deeper meanings that the Twilight fans do understand that you all are not privy to. The twilight fans are the majority and there are a ton of older women in the fandom that do not reveal their obsession for this saga because Stephenie Meyer classified it as a YA book even though it was written for adults originally.<br /><br />I am sure the raving reviews are coming from the closeted twihard women who have respectable jobs and images to uphold and fear ridicule from friends, co workers and family so that is probably why you are all a little confused as to why this book is so well received.<br />I don't care one way or the other if you find my taste in stories unacceptable, this is what I like and you can bad mouth the Twilight series all you want. I liked the ORIGINAL story and followed it religiously when it was MOTU. I bought the book and have to admit...I haven't been able to read past page twenty because it simply isn't acceptable to bother even trying to see this Fifty character as anyone other than Edward even with the name changes, it just doesn't work.<br />James had a huge following ranking number one in the fanfiction fandom at the height of the mania, and then pulled to publish.<br />In doing so, the story does not or will not make sense to the rest of the world who is diving into a trilogy that is without the saga it was originally based on. You will never get it or understand it so don't bother if you aren't going to invest you heart into it and read the Twilight saga first and then read the fanfiction version the way it was meant to be read. Then just maybe you you will get it, but there are no guarantees, because she had many haters of this falsely misleading genre.  I highly recommend that this story also be classified as Adult Erotica and remove the BDSM title. Never at any time does she submit to him and for those that call it porn, welcome to the new millennium of women enjoying a little kink in their lives. It is too bad that so many lack the desire to embrace sexual pleasure as a good thing versus taking us back to the 1950's where the word sex was hush hush....*rolls her eyes* This is classic Romeo Juliet stuff...one would die without the other...and if you didn't understand Shakespeare you will never understand Fifty or Edward.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Very good Christian movie.  Should be watched with the family together.  Has situations that apply to real life.  Professionally done.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I got this for my kids. They love the game. However, it freezes constantly on them and it looses track of the level they were on. They are not happy with this app at all. Please fix it.
B005F3DFXG|5.0|This is an excellent companion set to Walking With Dinosaurs, far more updated of course (yet discoveries are made every day still!), better graphics, but Walking With included Mammals and Amphibians of the age as well, so that series should not be discounted as of yet, anyway.  Planet Dinosaur does include Marine Reptiles and Plesiosaurs as well as dinosaurs.<br />Episode 1 deals with Spinosaurus, bigger and meaner than the famous T- Rex,<br />Episode 2 deals with the recent bird like dinosaurs,<br />Episode 3 deals with the Tyranosaurs<br />Episodes 4 and 5 deal with the marine reptiles and the four legged giants,<br />Episode 6 deals with the oddities and the mass extinction of everything that weighed more than 40 kilograms.<br />This series shows how they piece together the theories and the dates of the discoveries as well as the relative size to humans.<br />I ordered it from amazon.ca and it played on my blu-ray player, people having issues with this should upgrade their players with software available free online (the extras disc is a dvd so I can't play that one).
B004EBUXSA|5.0|So far I love this processor. Was able to overclock it to 4.5 GHZ on air (After getting a aftermarket cooler). When I had the stock cooling fan on, and running it at just 3.4 GHZ the processor touched 83 C. I since installed an aftermarket cooler, and overclocked to 4.5 GHZ. The processor doesn't get above 70 C even after long gaming sessions. One other thing is on the installation of the processor when closing the bar on the motherboard it makes a crackling sound. This made me very nervous as I don't remember any AMD's doing this, however, the computer runs just great!

B006UG90RM|3.0|All four Van Halen albums with Sammy Hagar reached billboards #1 chart position. None with David Lee Roth did, and this one didn't either. It's sliding down the charts fast because it doesn't come close to any of their previous recordings. Many of these reviews over rate this album, but chart position speaks volumes about public opinion and sales. Period.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I was almost fooled by the other reviews that I read here. I realized that there a lot of people out there who don't know how to use their equipment properly or set it up the way that it should be and decided to go ahead and see for myself...I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />These restorations are BEAUTIFUL and I'm so glad that I have them all at the great price of $25.00 - I was skeptical when the offer came out but after watching the restoration of the first movie along with most of the second, all I can say is - \\"WOW!\\"<br /><br />The scenes in Cuba in Godfather II are nothing short of breath taking and the sound quality is great! I have a 46\\" Samsung flat screen and a high quality surround sound system and I was absolutely blown away. Is it dark? It most certainly is...but the original producers/directors meant it to be. If you watch the extra on DVD #4 \\"Emulsional Rescue Revealing The Godfather HD\\", you will understand why everything is dark. My father remembered seeing this in the theatre in 1974 and said these scenes were as good/better than he remembers.<br /><br />Order this and watch it...you won't be sorry. For all those who talk about aspect ratio; mine played just fine in 16:9 aspect ratio and filled the whole screen. The only way I could get it to play in Letterbox was when I forced the TV to do so. I am SOOOOOOOOO glad that I went through with this purchase and will enjoy it for many years to come. Thank you Francis, thank you BluRay technology, and THANK YOU Amazon for a great price!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|After having seen this game on an iPad and owning it for iPhone, I had high hopes that this would be a better experience on my large tablet screen. However, I have not been able to play the game more than 2 minutes before it freezes. I have contacted support but thought I should post a review/warning that you may not want to purchase for TF101 until we know that this will work.<br />Also, as the description states, it is NOT customized for tablets, so it looks quite low-quality with grainy graphics on my screen.  It looked high-def on iPad so hopefully an update will fix this...?<br />I am hoping an update fixes the ICS bug and the graphic quality. I really do look forward to playing this game!
B002ZG99TK|5.0|This is a wonderful film.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Best action film since the Die Hard movies.  I have never been much of an action movie fan. I am more of a comedy movie fan. However,this movie is one of my favorites and I had to add it to my movie collection.
0679736646|5.0|What is UBIK? Well its kinda hard to explain and that's what a PKD novel is.<br />This is an LSD tablet in the form of literature. Whats happening? Where am I?  These are all common elements among his books. This story also has 'Precogs'(Psychics),'Psis', 'Anti-Psis' and a much more evolved precog.<br />Its very hard to review this book, but I'll explain what its about without giving anything away.<br /><br />The year is 1992. Joe Chip is a technician working under Glen Ruciter, who runs a business employing psychics to block precog mind infiltration. Runciters wife Ella who is in a 'Half Life' state, in which you can communicate with the dead through cryonic suspension. Her advice runs Glens 'Prudence Organization'.<br />We meet a mysterious woman, Pat Conley, who has a power no one has seen, she can go back in time to alter events yet for just a small amount of time, about 5 minutes, and now is working for Runciter.<br /><br />When Joe, Runciter, Conley and a group of interesting inertials go to the moon to visit with associates. They find it to be a trap.<br />Returning to Earth, it is then that mysterious and missing pieces of time begin to deteriorate; cigerettes are stale, cream is moldy and clumpy and technology is rapidly moving backward and dissolving. These characters are real and you can feel the paranoia aspect of it all, and that was what made PKD so known for; the feelings he could put on paper, along with a ending that is always worth it and always makes you think. This is a must read.<br /><br />UBIK was published in 1969.
030745455X|5.0|Rarely do sequels live up to the standards set by the original, but this is a pleasant exception. The first rendition of Salander's forays was more about Blomkvist and he journey to complete an assignment, with a fair bit of Salander mixed in. But this sequel is all about Salander, a strong-willed 4ft something tall girl with the guts and wits to take on the world. Perhaps more pensive and a faster pace book than the Dragon Tattoo. Can't wait to wrap up the series!

B0073LWEXK|2.0|Even considering I got this on sale for 99 cents, the game was pitifully short: not more than two hours without using any hints. The puzzles were trivial to solve and lacked any real depth. Rather, this game seemed to require rote memorization and navigation skills more than any puzzle-solving ability. The story was also badly written and failed to engage me at all.

B000XR4OC0|5.0|I have read multiple reviews on these shoes saying that they do not last. I have to disagree. I have had the same pair of TOMS for over a year and a half and I wear them almost everyday. I even took them with me on a month long trip to Germany and walked around in them all day. They held up and are very comfortable. The soles have not worn down and when I wash them they look brand new. Awesome shoes!

0307593312|1.0|Murakami's 1Q84 is a huge disappointment. A good crab cake has lots of meat and little filler. So should a good novel whether the meat is plot, style, character development, social insight---whatever the perspective. Unfortunately, Murakai's novel is mostly filler with little meat. At more than 900 pages, it is to use a word I seldom get to use, \\"bloviated\\" as well as tedious and frequently dull. With good editing it could, and should have been, 350-400 pages; the plot would have supported such a length
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Super fun for all ages! I love the variety and its great for my five year old daughter too<br /><br />I would recommend it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I don't think it's the greatest, but it's. ok for passing time. i think it needs a better variety of games to play.
B004A8ZWWO|2.0|I'll admit it, I did laugh a few times, but overall this movie is a really poor comedy. The jokes and comedic parts all feel like they are copy pasted from a bad comedian, and its story might be an original story to a degree, but it still ends up bland and has what can only be described as a lame excuse for a plot twist at the end. There is even an attempted \\"love relationship\\" in the movie, but it doesn't go anywhere and is completely pointless (like basically everything in the movie). This movie sucks. If I were you, I really wouldn't waste my money...

B0071PS7AC|1.0|I think the game sucked it destroyed my spirits so I beg of you boys and girls don't buy it<br />And I am still single
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is a quick and easy read.  You will get addicted to it, and when you are finished you will be wanting more.  If you are interested in the movie trailer, you will not be disappointed with this series.  It is like no book I have ever read before.  It is a must read.
0393061310|3.0|Firstly, the Pulitzer Prize Winning book's title is misleading advertising! It should have been called something like \\"Geographical Germs, Agriculture & Animal Domestication\\"...but his publishers & marketing gurus convinced him that such a title wouldn't have sold much. In fact, there is very little content in the book about guns, metals, or technological advancement. He originally wrote it in 1997, and in 2005 he was convinced to add a silly meandering chapter entitled \\"Guns, Germs and Steel Today\\"...where he vainly tries to solidify his weak excuse for a book title by peppering the reader with references to the somewhat amusing title abbreviation \\"GGS\\".<br /><br />This promising book is unfortunately regularly marred by weak uncompelling writing skills and very poor editing! The affable author begins the epilogue of his often disappointingly repetitious book by making an excuse that he only has 400+ pages to \\"compress\\" 13,000 years of global human history. Half of its overall content focuses on Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea (which is likely refreshing to all those with ancestry in that part of the world). There is hardly any mention of India, Russia, and many other countries...<br /><br />I however still rate Jared Diamond's publication as an entity worth reading, because he manages to present many valuably salient literary facts & theories on human, animal, and agricultural evolution!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am pretty fit but I am looking to tone my body more.  This workout absolutely kicks my butt.  This is my second day doing level one and I am just drenched in sweat and I am always breathing hard throughout the entire workout.  She really works you hard and her workouts are amazing!! I thought I would be able to do level 1 for a couple of days and then move straight on to level 2. Nope.  I am definitely going to be on level 1 until I can do it without being totally wiped out after.  Great workout and I definitely recommend it!!

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I purchased the watch several weeks ago as i am running the LA marathon this year.  I am not technically savvy at all and honestly at first i was intimidated by the whole thing.  But the instructions are good and I managed to set the things i needed, which for me were the intervals.  After reading and reading i figured out the order i should do things to get my intervals going and how to toggle between screens so i can see my current pace as i run.  The instructions are all there in the manual on the disk but i had to read an re-read to understand it--but i think it is just me not used to so many steps--i think most people would find it easier.  At times the touch screen can be annoying it was always beeping at me and i would get frustrated but over time i figured how to stop that as well.  I will also say that this watch can do so so so much more than what i use it for.  maybe one day i will try and figure it out.  I also had a lot of trouble taking off the big bulky plastic bands to put on the velcro bands--in fact i still have not been able to do it, but apparently the tutorial online at garmin.com is supposed to be perfect, but i do not want to change a thing before my marathon so i will try next week!  I say buy the watch--the lower models did not have the interval training i needed and when i found the next level up that did this watch was only $20 more and i figured i would go for it

B00571F26Y|4.0|Great information in this book, but let's face it, it's hard to avoid wheat products in this day and age. The information is top notch and very motivating, but the weakness is that it's not practical for the average person.
B004UID2LC|5.0|you can download your files into video or mp3s. the mp3s go straight to your music! (I use my kindle fire for this app) it does take a while to get used to though.
1400069289|4.0|This well written book gives several useful nuggets. Want to change an employee's behavoir? Bake in a response before a difficult situation arises. That is what Starbucks does when it trains employees on how to handle an angry customer. And they help employees find their own wisdom through written exercises where they end up teaching themselves. The chapter on Rosa Parks is especially interesting. There were others who refused to give up their seats to white riders and zero happened. By contrast, Parks had a far flung network that she built through habitually being of service and help to others. The network was galvanized when she needed it. Helpful end chapter on trying to put the book's lessons to use.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|This was a pretty good story. You got your Hero and your Heroine and your bad guys, but what are they talking about?  Teenagers forced to fight each other to the death in a futuristic world.  Parents should read this before allowing an impressionable teenager delve into this and draw the wrong conclusions.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard Dr. Drew rant against this book a week ago on his show.. and his wife couldn't rave about it enough.  I couldn't get their conversation out of my mind as their opinions were exactly opposite, so I decided to try to get through the first one.  This was two days ago. I am now almost halfway through the third book.<br />Contrary to the opinion of Dr. Drew, this series does NOT revolve around BDSM.  While it has MANY sex scenes, it is a love story between an innocent girl and a man with severe issues relating to early childhood and adolescence.  If anything, I feel more compassion for Christian than anything.  He has been through he** and has somehow survived in one piece.  He is damaged (50 shades, hence the title), but Ana helps him BECAUSE SHE LOVES HIM.<br />These books are intense and very well written.  To be honest, I will deeply miss these characters when I am through with this final book.. by tomorrow afternoon..<br />To all of you romance lovers who can handle sex scenes.... BUY THESE BOOKS!!!<br />E.L. - MORE PLEASE!!!  CONGRADS ON THIS AMAZING SERIES!!!

B003YL4L0W|5.0|Writing on contemporary topics is difficult and few novels are as successful as this one is.  Jodi Picoult has created a page turner that covers some of the hottest of the hot button social issues today.  It is not just an ambitious book, it comes with a CD (or download) of 10 songs for which the author has written lyrics.<br /><br />The story is told in 3 narrative voices (a fourth at the end) for the main characters; two, Zoe and Max, are very well drawn. The third, a Vanessa, is sympathetically, if not consistently drawn (she is to be the level headed one, but isn't always). Other characters like Zoe's mother, her lawyer, Pastor Clive, Reid and Liddy have stock personalities. For instance, Zoe's lawyer is a stereotype of a folksy, wisecracking but super competent lawyer.Zoe's mother is the ultimate new ager - to the point of informing the judge and court on the properties of water.<br /><br />Picoult knows a lot about the fertility/infertility, musicology and legal processes. The technical aspects of each are well woven into the story.<br /><br />The time frame is unrealistic. Most people wait months (or years) for a divorce, but the Baxter's are divorced almost as quickly as they decide to get one. Zoe's recovery from a number of medical problems and surgery and Zoe & Max's subsequent litigation also progress with unrealistic speed.<br /><br />Despite weaknesses in some character portraits, the time line and that school guidance offices should know more about the families of at risk students than Vanessa does, this is a page turner.  The physical book (don't know about downloads) has a good type face and is easy on the eye, making for a quick read.<br /><br />I was at a movie theater a few days ago, and the lead song \\"Sing You Home\\" provided the background music for the coming attractions movie quizzes and local ads.<br /><br />The book is a 4.5, but given the difficulties of writing something like this, I'm rounding it off higher.

B003FB0268|4.0|Once in a while a great book comes along that revolutionizes the way you look at your life. This book is a super-classic and this edition (with this particular cover) is my favorite one. It's such a great gift idea, especially for people whose lives are in transition, i.e. unemployed, college graduates, milestone birthdays, et cetera. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because I feel that there is a void that the book does not fill; the why is there, it is the how that seems to elude me.

0812992792|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read, on my top ten list. An eye opener to how the population live and the disasterous conditions they live in. Not even family members can talk to each other about their feelings for fear that one of them will go to the \\"authorities\\" and they will be thrown into prison or just disappear. Yes, you will hate the protagonist at first but then you can't help pulling for him throughout the story. Fantastic writing by the author!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I love this movie. I hope it eventually has a special edition. For the people complaing that it has a cheesy 80s soyndtrack: the music isn't actually from the 80s for the most part and the movie is supposed to have an 80s feel. Opening credit text encaptures that. Great movie, much better than movies that have been coming out recently.

B006ZZAMWK|4.0|The UK pop group One Direction has their debut album 'Up All Night' now released in the US. This pop group has been a phenomenon/sensation both in the UK & Ireland since last year. This album (13 tracks) has great pop music (that you'll like to sing-along & dance all night) as well as great closing dance numbers in \\"Save You Tonight\\" & \\"Stole My Heart\\". Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"What Makes You Beatiful\\", a happy up-tempo pop song & first single, \\"Gotta Be You (2012 US Version), wonderful music & melody, \\"More Than This\\", \\"I Wish\\" & \\"Same Mistakes\\", incredible piano, melody & vocals. This is my favourite track from this great CD. Great tracks include \\"One Thing\\", \\"Tell Me A Lie\\" written by the American pop diva Kelly Clarkson & dance numbers \\"Save You Tonight\\" & \\"Stole My Heart\\" : these will make you feel like dancing the night away.<br /><br />On overall, this new CD by One Direction 'Up All Night' is a great compilation of happy upbeat pop songs that you'll enjoy, a highly recommended CD listening.

0893860220|5.0|The awakened one, you see, is not a sleeper, like you and me, he's not a teacher; let alone a preacher; neither a prophet nor looking to profit. He isn't a snake, or an obvious fake; he is awake!<br /><br />Nisargadatta Maharaj was a shop keeper who `woke up', a sloppy concept for Westerners I am sure, and this book is a transcription of his conversations. By all accounts, Nisargadatta Maharaj was uneducated and none religious, but from what I am reading in this book, the guy seemed to be `tapping' into a source of profundity that even a book laden guru would struggle to top. He has little money, he didn't run a money pinching ashram and he gave talks on the top of his shop in the slums of India.<br /><br />So what are these Indian guys saying anyway? They are saying that this life you are living is not merely an isolated piece of the universe, but in a certain sense your consciousness is the whole of the ocean of the universe, poured into your little skull! It is only that this whole cannot be surveyed in a single glance that you believe yourself to be an isolated blip on the canvas. You are in reality the almighty consciousness that was there before Adam; yes, you! You cannot feel this one big consciousness because your monkey brain can no way cope with the cosmic consciousness, just like an Amiga 500 would struggle to play a low resolution web page; but when you fall asleep and have one of those intensely weird dreams; this is your consciousness re-connecting with the higher reservoir of awareness. Hey, that sounds good to me! Nisargadatta Maharaj was in full connection with the One Consciousness.<br /><br />I will write about Nisargadatta Maharaj's philosophy of optimism; I AM THAT. Nisargadatta Maharaj's message of 'I am' seems to be holding my despair at bay and every time I want to dive deeper, the awakening lifts me higher and helps my spirits to rise above the turmoil; like a balloon that rises out of the choking atmosphere, to rest above the transience of my world; above the mental dust that blinds and chokes; I am floating above the atmosphere; where no one can pull me back down again.<br /><br />The awakening is taking place on this particular day, now, as you read this; I realize you may not feel this; this floating above the world. D. T Suzuki, the Japanese Zen master, was once asked what it was like to have satori; satori being the Japanese word for enlightenment, he said: \\"Well, it's like ordinary, everyday experience, except about two inches off the ground.\\"<br /><br />Masters like D. T. Suzuki and Nisargadatta Maharaj possessed an aspect that we scientific minded Westerners seem to have lost. Fortunately, I really do believe that you yourself can start your own floating above the world; right Now. And you don't even need a balloon metaphor to get the point across. You see, if like me, you are not too fond of balloons; you can construct a boat to be your life vehicle. You can then metaphorically float along the torrents of this world and navigate your way to the Ding an sich. Nisargadatta Maharaj says that the world of appearance is boundless as far as your eye can see, indeed, a boundless Matrix of some sort (my rendering). You must therefore trust your frail craft to navigate soundly between the Matrix, with its banks of happiness and pain. Between these banks of happiness and pain the river of life flows on; unmolested. The trick is not to capsize on a bank. The real secret is to navigate your boat through the howling mountainous waves of people and their opinions; and just float along the river of life, or, to use the old clich&eacute;, `go with the flow'.<br /><br />It is only when your vehicle capsizes on one of the banks that life becomes a problem. By flowing with life, Nisargadatta Maharaj means acceptance in I AM THAT, rather than what the other guy thinks you are. The other guy feeds off your fears and your desires, so don't (overly) desire and don't fear, observe your surroundings; the guy is not in the room with you now. Your body is always present, your mind is not. Your mind is somewhere else. Take back your mind!n the room with you now. Your body is always present, your mind is not. Your mind is somewhere else. Take back your mind!

B0059XTUB8|5.0|Marilyn's lateness in getting to sets, which became progressively worse over time, was based on her fear and insecurity that she just wasn't good enough, and that the camera doesn't lie. (At least, this is what she confided to a friend, who knew her during this period.) Michelle Williams does an absolutely amazing job at capturing Marilyn's essence, as though she were personally channeling the late star. Eddie Redmayne was also effective as Colin Clark, the 23-year-old who develops a special friendship with the famous star during the filming of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl.\\" Though it's a snapshot of a particular time in Marilyn's life, it's the best biographical film ever done about her and highly recommended.

0071373586|4.0|This is a classic in the marketing field. The authors define positioning as \\"a new approach to communication...But positioning is not what you do to a product. Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect. That is, you position the product in the mind of the prospect.\\"<br /><br />The book then goes on to present the concept of positioning, and the associated challenges and opportunities. What sets this book apart is the plethora of examples that are provided from a variety of industries (both services and products) that illustrate both how position can and should be used, and how it shouldn't be.<br /><br />Finally the authors extend the concept of positioning and show how it can be applied to one's self and career. In addition how one can start a positioning program for a business.<br /><br />A very insightful and educational book -  a must read in the business arena and particularly the marketing field.<br /><br />Below are some key excerpts from this book:<br /><br />1) \\"Positioning is an organized system for finding a window in the mind. It is based on the concept that communication can only take place at the right time and under the right circumstance.\\"<br /><br />2) \\"Leaders should use their short-term flexibility to assure themselves of a stable long-term future. As a matter of fact, the marketing leader is usually the one who moves the ladder into the mind with his or her brand nailed to the one and only rung.\\"<br /><br />3) \\"This is the classic mistake made by the leader. The illusion that the power of the product is derived from the power of the organization. It's just the reverse. The power of the organization is derived from the power of the product, the position that the product owns in the prospect's mind.\\"<br /><br />4) \\"But today in the product arena and in the political arena, you have to have a position. There are too many competitors out there. You can't win by not making enemies, by being everything to everybody. To win in today's competitive environment, you have to go out and make friends, carve out a specific niche in the market. Even if you lose a few doing so.\\"<br /><br />5) \\"With a good name your positioning job is going to be a lot easier.\\"<br /><br />6) \\"A name is a rubber band. It will stretch, but not beyond a certain point. Furthermore, the more you stretch a name, the weaker it becomes.\\"<br /><br />7) \\"The lesson here is that a succesfull positioning program requires a major long-term commitment by the people in charge.\\"<br /><br />8) \\"The solution to a positioning problem is usually found in the prospect's mind, not in the product.\\"<br /><br />9) \\"Positioning yourself and your career...Define yourself...Make mistakes...Make sure your name is right...Avoid the no-name trap...Avoid the line-extension trap...Find a horse to ride...The first horse to ride is your company...The second horse to ride is your boss...The third horse to ride is a friend...The fourth horse to ride is an idea...The fifth horse to ride is faith...The sixth horse to ride is yourself.\\"<br /><br />10) \\"Positioning your business...What position do you own?...What position do you want to own?...Whom must you outgun?...Do you have enough money?...Can you stick it out?...Do you match your position?...The role of the outsider...What the outsider doesn't supply.\\"<br /><br />11) \\"Playing the positioning game...You must understand the roles of words...You must know how words affect people...You must be careful of change...You need vision...You need courage...You need objectivity...You need simplicity...You need subtlety...You must be willing to sacrifice...You need a global outlook...What you don't need.\\"titive environment, you have to go out and make friends, carve out a specific niche in the market.

B005VTS4EY|4.0|This is a fun game! Challenging but not impossible. Easy to get the hang of. I enjoy playing this game. I would recommend to  others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started this book and literally couldn't stop reading it. The author has a way to do what so many writers cant. She brings you in, keeps you there and then rocks your entire world. I am really good at predicting where a story is going to go, however, just when I was thinking it would go one way the book went in a completely different direction. Fantastic series, if I could give more stars I would. If the movie is a tenth as good as this trilogy I think it may become my favorite!!
0307474259|5.0|I've been telling my doctor and various friends that this calories in-out view of weight control was nonsense. They just shrug, because they don't have a problem with obesity. I was a normal sized kid until age 10, then I suddenly puffed up. I was told that this \\"baby fat\\" would go away. Just stop chugging colas and eating candy bars. Problem was, I wasn't drinking soda or eating candy bars. When I was 14 I discovered the no-carb diet all by myself. Unfortunately I was also starving myself and didn't realize it. So, that lead to a kind of exhaustion. That's what happens when you don't get what is going on. You need to eat the right food, and enough of it, so that you do not go hungry. For me it is at least 60g protein and no more then 30g sugar. 60g/30g: that is my diet. If you eat fish, eggs, and lean meats you dont have to worry about anything else. Get enough of that kind of protein and you will be doing OK. Take a multi-vitamin and an extra vitamin-D to be sure.<br /><br />I have gained and lost the same 80 pounds over the years. It takes willpower to lose weight by the ways we are told. I feel like I'm on a hamster wheel when in weight-loss mode. I told this to my doctor, and all he said was \\"try to lose the weight\\".<br /><br />So, yeah, this book rings true. I follow the diet and have been losing weight now without effort.<br /><br />Bad news: no more fruit juice, cookies, ice cream, cakes, pies (i.e.: no more sugar and white flour).<br /><br />Good news: all the blue cheese dressing, avocado, Cobb salad, chef salad, steak, vegetables, fish, you can stand.<br /><br />Eat fish, lean meats, vegetables, and cheese. You will get over the sugar cravings, eventually. To answer the sugar crave, eat plain yogurt with fresh fruit. Fresh fruit is always better than the jelly they put in yogurt-fruit-at-the-bottom.
B0072X2NUS|3.0|Really nothing here that would remind you of the overall amazing body of work created by Martin or Vince over the last 30 years or so.  I for one don't really understand 'minimalist techno'  If you ask me the compositions on 'Speak and Spell' were more interesting. This was a curious experiment from two of my favorite electronic songwriters, but I prefer their more traditional work and find this pretty bland and forgettable.  Best suited for a dance floor or workout routine...but maybe that is the point.

1612130283|5.0|This is the first written work I have ever read that accurately describes the relationship between the Dominant and submissive.  It's not a dynamic easily understood and it was perfectly well portrayed in this book.  If you want to truly understand the power exchange that occurs in a rich D/s relationship with an experienced Dominant, this is the book to read.  I have never found any other type of relationship to be as deeply enriching, fulfilling and rewarding.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I really can't stand romantic novels or anything gooey/mushy. I was skeptical at first, honestly. But this book surprised me so many times. There was romance, but instead of boring me or making me cringe it made my heart race and it made me cry and it made me hope the book never ended. I wanted to read about Alex and Lena forever. The way Lauren writes is so unbelievable, you get sucked in from page one and you feel every word on the page. When Lena cried, I cried. When she was angry, I was angry. I've never been so attached to any two characters in my life... with maybe only a few exceptions.<br /><br />I don't care who you are or what you're into... Read this book. I've been done with it for weeks and it's still on my mind.
0788812807|5.0|When I was just a little kid my mother took me to see this movie at the theater.  At that time I was not allowed popcorn or a drink.  The movie was much better with the refreahments and I could pause the tape to go to the bathroom and never miss a second.  It was even better than when I was seven.

1932100660|5.0|Seriously, everyone must read this book. Not only are the scientific facts made approachable through frank and accessible language, but the information presented will also knock your socks off. Being someone with a passion for healthy living, I was already familiar with the idea that a whole food, plant-based diet is beneficial for a number of reasons. As T. Colin Campbell acknowledged in The China Study, however, there is a lot of conflicting information out there. As soon as you read the benefits of one type of food, you can easily turn around and find a report stating the opposite. It can be very confusing!<br /><br />As an athlete, I always understood that protein, specifically animal protein, was essential for muscle recovery. While my personal research kept leading me to the conclusion that most of the foods that truly allow us to thrive come from plants, I still felt fearful of letting go of animal-based foods due to the heavy general consensus that they are essential. After reading The China Study, I found out that this was not so. I now understand the nature of all proteins, whether animal or plant-based, and can see that what I thought was helping me was actually holding me back. The overwhelmingly conclusive nature of these studies left me with great clarity as to how to proceed with my diet.<br /><br />No matter how you choose to continue living, do yourself a favor and make yourself aware of the findings in this book. You won't regret a single page.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games were very challenging but over all it was a good game. Wish there was another way to get points other than buying them.
B005MMJ84K|2.0|I found this book to be quite disappointing, although parts of it are very good.  I guess it is just too predictable and too much in the popular formula of the Twilight series, Hunger Games, and the Pretties (Uglies)books.  I wanted more.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adeles voice and I couldn't wait to get this CD.  It is just as good as I thought it would be.  I listen to it every day.  If you like Adele than you will enjoy this CD.  Shipping was also fast.  Couldn't have asked for more.
0062060554|4.0|In BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP by S.J. Watson, Christine wakes up every morning with no memory of the days before, of who that man (her husband, Ben) in bed with her is, of who she is or how old she is. Every day her husband tells her who they are and what happened to cause this memory problem. He claims she was in an accident with a hit-and-run driver.<br /><br />This book is about Christine regaining memories, little by little. She's aided by a person who claims to be Doctor Nash. He calls her every morning to reintroduce himself. At first, it sometimes seems slow and repetitious because of Christine's same routine every day. But it's also more and more mysterious with each new memory.<br /><br />Why does Ben keep most information from Christine? Does he think he's helping her, or is there some devious reason? And why, when Christine asks about a new memory, does he seem hesitant to answer? Does he tell her the truth? What is he hiding and why?<br /><br />And is this Doctor Nash really who he says he is? Is he really involved for the reasons he states?<br /><br />Here is what I know: there are several different types of amnesia and a few different possible causes, brain trauma being just one of them. Brain trauma is the cause Ben claims to Christine. But is he being honest?<br /><br />Christine retains memory for a day, only to lose it all overnight while she's sleeping. Is something other than or in addition to brain trauma the cause? What else is going on?<br /><br />Many other reader reviews of this book complain about its implausibility. If they are referring to Christine's amnesia, that is probably easier for me to believe because I, too, had amnesia as a result of an accident and still occasionally regain memories I didn't know I had forgotten, even after 34 years. For a short time, I couldn't even retain day-to-day memories. So I know Watson wasn't completely making this up, just stretching the truth.<br /><br />Although the amnesia described in BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP isn't implausible, I did catch things that are. For example, at the suggestion of Doctor Nash, Christine keeps a journal. Every day she describes that day, so she knows what happened in the days before. BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is her journal. How does she have the time to both write it (in longhand) and then reread it every day along with anything else she does that day?<br /><br />But I just went along with it.<br /><br />Then Christine starts remembering enough to be suspicious. And just as she goes back and forth suspecting Ben or her doctor or her old friend, then suspecting her memory instead of them, I, too, went back and forth with my own suspicions. It truly became a thriller.<br /><br />BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP forces the reader to become tense with suspicion. It is this aspect that I think must be the reason the book is such a bestseller and garners so much praise. I can tell you that this is what won me over and is the reason I rate it so highly.<br /><br />I won this book from the Algonquin Books blog.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just as much fun as the original angry birds, but with a few twists of its own. A bit overall easier too.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay was a thrilling finale to the series. It was about The Girl On Fire (Katniss Everdeen) planning the assassination of President Snow and Coin. Primrose also died in this book, which made Katniss kind of hate Gale since it was Gale's bomb that caused Prim and many other children's deaths. You may say it's sloppily written if you only read the book one or at least 1/4 of it. Suzanne Collins, continue the epilogue! :))
0937381888|5.0|I decided to give home brewing a shot and picked this book up. It is a very easy read and will not bore you. After reading it I went out and purchased all the necessary equipment and was boiling later that day. If you have never read anything about home brewing and looking to give it a try... This is your book!
0062112430|5.0|A VERY good book. One of my all time favorites. Full of action and suspense and you're right there with the characters. I found some of it predictable, but I liked that. I identified with the protagonist and the author has done an awesome job on this book
B005K17RU0|5.0|App is very to setup and use. Love the extended forecast, doppler radar, and the alerts for my area. I would strongly recommend downloading this app.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|It's not a horrible squel, but it doesn't have the magic and suspense of the first. There were parts when it started to bore me, and I still havent finished the last couple of chapters.
B000WAEJZ0|4.0|Overall its a okay cd, about five of the songs on the cd are awesome. The other ones I wouldn't consider a hit. I still do not regret buying the cd though. It's a Whitney must have. I got my cd when it was supposed to be delivered & it came looking brand new in a case. Amazon did its job great as usual.
006197806X|5.0|This was just as good as the first one. I really liked the way the author broke it up between now and then. I'm not so impressed with the newly developed love triangle, it is a bit overdone. But she knows how to do cliffhangers or sure. There were so many throughout the book I could not put it down. I just had to see what happened next. I am also quite sad that I have to wait a year for the net one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A lot of people did not like this book...it did lack the \\"feel\\" that all the other books posessed.<br />However, this book felt real.<br />It was a real look into those who get post traumatic stress disorder.  That's what Katniss basically had after everything she went through.  I thought it was a fantastic look into how even soldiers form the Middle Eastern war feel.<br />I thought the book was excellent and I got the happy ending that so many books try to destroy because they think it's a twist.<br /><br />There were a lot of twists in this book.  Peeta changed, but it made me feel like I missed the old Peeta a lot.  I really could feel Katniss's longing for the old Peeta as well.  However, what happened to Peeta probabley would have happened to a real prisoner of war as well.<br /><br />I think this book has a ton of real life situations, it's just hard to see our favorite characters go through it.  But as in real life, it is hard to have family members go to war, come back and be almost completey different people.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|works great on the kindle fire.  love playing it when I'm bored and is fun all the time. free apps don't get any better.
0743297334|4.0|I intentionally read this book while vacationing in Key West and visiting some of Hemingway's hang outs.  I knew when starting the book that Hemingway's language was spare and his style style was compared to an iceberg (90% of the story is below the surface) but I was not seeing the real story.  I was about half way done when my daughter suggested reading the free, on-line analysis from Spark Notes as I went along.  That made a huge difference in understanding the book's relationship to World War I, man's ongoing struggle with masculinity, and the struggle with the discontent in our lives.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is addicting and awesome plus its got more games everytime you get bored which is just fantastic I love this game and recommend it to everyone in the world
0451232577|5.0|Ken Follet is a great author, and I have read about everything he has written. \\"Fall of Giants\\" shows his extensive dedication to historical research. Characterizations are very good as his usually are. This is not a light read for summer fun but is written for those serious historical fiction buffs who enjoy commitment to a real \\"classic\\". It's understandable that he takes a while  to write sequels requiring so much research, but I sure hope it's not as long before his next book in this Trilogy as it was with the sequel to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". So if you're not into \\"sissy\\" reading, love historical  fiction reads, and enjoy good lengthy stories,  you will like \\"Fall of Giants\\".  I hated to see \\"Fall of Giants\\" end, never looked to see what page I was on, and Im looking forward to seeing how the next generation turns out and survives. I recommend this book to serious readers.

B004WCTLNY|3.0|The Adjustment Bureau is a part [[ASIN:B001Q2U5B0 The Butterfly Effect]], a little [[ASIN:B000HAB4KS The Matrix]], and one major scene from [[ASIN:B0011E7JBW Men In Black]].  In this amalgamation, Matt Damon plays politician David Norris who has just suffered a crushing defeat as a result of his impetuousness.  While planning his concession speech in a bathroom, he has a star-crossed meeting with a ballerina named Elise (Emily Blunt).  The resulting affair uncovers what is presumed to be the Adjustment Bureau, a team of caretaker angels who control the timeline of humanity's decisions so what is supposed to occur actually takes place.<br /><br />Damon and Blunt make a good protagonist couple.  The connection between leads is fairly convincing.  It's easy to perceive they were divined for one another.  Which is an accomplishment considering the lukewarm vibe exuded the last time he was supposed to be romantically linked to a brunette with a British accent.  Supporting actors like the always magnificent Terrance Stamp - who was interestingly enough in the movie Wanted, which shares many similarities with this film - fill out the gray more than adequately.  A few pseudo-celebrities and politicians show up as themselves.  They could have been left out.<br /><br />The major failings of this film revolve around the brief explanation of the caretakers, their abilities and responsibilities, and why David and Elise are doomed to failure with one another.  Especially since the plan is apparently changeable.  Not to mention why one of the caretakers would ever help David be with Elise.  Way too many missing plot pieces.<br /><br />Action is minimal, but there is a classic running sequence that would make Tom Cruise jealous.  In fact, intensity is lacking as well; the second act just takes way too long to get to the meat of the story.<br /><br />Decent Matt Damon vehicle about overcoming odds, changing destiny, and finding true love, but it's probably not a must see.
B003L77GGK|4.0|Ahh - could it be that Supernatural is finally going down hill and has truly jumped the shark? Granted, this season is by far the least in quality compared to the other seasons, but it is still enjoyable. It starts out well, gets slow in the middle (and a bit off track), but picks up again with a nice season finale. The season gives you a bit of a different perspective on Dean and Sam - in a way they almost switch roles, with Sam being more of the tough guy and Dean more of an emotional character. If you like the character Bobby, his presence in this season seems a bit more robust than in others. Overall, worth watching, but it will make you long a bit for previous seasons intensity and creativity. All in all, still a great watch and hopefully season 7 will bring us more quality with the Winchester boys.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|good game, easy to play, fun to play, easy to download and I love playing games  on the kindle fire.
B000FVNX2Q|3.0|HP calculators used to be THE calculator to use for finance or science. They were built like tanks and had all the functionality you could ever need. Granted, some people have issues with the RPN entry, but once you get used to it, it actually makes more logical sense - really it does - just give it time. The landscape style of this calc also is great to use and it is fast. However, this is not the HP 12 series of yore. It is cheaply made and almost seems hollow. the buttons are not as firm or tactile as they used to be. The 'leather' style case is nice, but you are going to want and make sure that you baby this device a bit, as I don't think it can hold up like the old ones did. Go into any CFOs office and you'll probably see some version of this veteran calculator. I just wish the old HP quality was there for the price that they request.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is fun and entertaining, I wouldn't recommend it for younger children since there are interactions with other people playing the same games.  I didn't rate it 5 stars because it's limited with Kindle Fire.  If I don't get back in time to put the food on the table it will spoil, also I cant revive other peoples foods as with the FB games I can.  Wish we could do more in the game though.  Enjoy!!  It's actually fun
B000EWD1KK|5.0|I love this movie.  Danny Kaye was a great comedian in his day.  This does take you back a lot of years, but the trip is worth it.  Even Boris Karloff is in this movie and he plays a rather funny character for someone who used to play a monster on TV.  You won't be sorry for owning this DVD.
B001PP9ALY|2.0|but the execution fails.<br /><br />If you really like special effects, this is probably a good choice for you. If you want a main character to root for, not so much.<br /><br />Wanted has the kernel of a good movie in it. Unfortunately, the main actor just can't pull it off, and Morgan Freeman just doesn't do that much in the movie.<br /><br />However, Angelina Jolie is quite good. Remake the movie, make her the main character, and Wanted would be much better. Jolie's Final scene is perfect for her character. Unfortunately, the finale continues from them. Still not quite clear on what the point of the last line. I should feel bad for not killing people?<br /><br />Regardless, pick up if you like special effects or Jolie (she really is quite good in this), otherwise very easy to skip.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|This is a fantastic CD!  Whitney Houston was a wonderful singer.  Her performances on this compilation were all first class.  I noticed she gives more than your moneys worth of singing.  The length of time she spent on each song was much longer than any CD I have ever owned.  This woman had the best voice I have ever heard.  It was very powerful and smooth at the same time.  A must own for any fan.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I was extremely impressed with both the picture and sound quality of all 8 movies. All made incredibly well, they gave a clear picture of what the writer of the books was trying to convey. Watching all the characters grow up and face new challenges was also very encouraging. I think this is a great set of movies for all ages and teaches valuable lessons to children. Amazing and awesome to watch over and over again!
B004A8ZWWY|5.0|My wife and I had gone to the movie last year to see this very entertaining show.  We now own it on BluRay and it is just as good on the smaller screen at home.  Ben Stiller was great.  I normally don't like his movies, but this one suited him.  The rest of the characters were also very funny.  If you like a relaxing comedy, I would get a copy.
1591843790|5.0|This book is enchanting that it changed my mindset. So it didn't only teach me about how to enchant others, but it enchanted me personally on my view of the world and how to prepare myself for the future. This is a great book for business students. It teaches one how to treat others and how to be a great human being, a \\"mensch\\".
B004KKX80A|1.0|WARNING!  THEY HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED THE BEYBLADE SYSTEM!  The new tops are COMPLETELY INCOMPATIBLE with the old tops.  None of the parts can be interchanged, which was part of the interest.  The old launchers DO NOT WORK with the new tops!  Worse yet, the new launchers are ergonomic nightmares!  Whereas the old ones were well-designed, not only to better launch the top but to protect the child's hand, the new ones are both difficult to hold and prone to hurt little fingers!  They are too close to the spinning top itself.  My son hurt his hand on the first try.  What's even more surprising is that the new ones CANNOT BE LAUNCHED BOTH RIGHT-HANDED AND LEFT-HANDED!!  The old ones allowed both.  Furthermore, the whole concept of the magnetic \\"control\\" is now gone.<br /><br />On top of it all, the new tops are smaller and weigh less than the old tops.  Therefore, they tend to perform poorly by comparison.  In fact, it is clear that the main impetus behind this redesign was to reduce cost!!  As a result, every part is smaller or has less material.  This even includes the pull cords, which are poorly made now.<br /><br />I say BOYCOTT BEYBLADE!  The competitors are all coming out.  I'm angered that I've invested in a bunch of tops and launchers for my son, and now he has to deal with two incompatible systems, and tops that are not evenly matched opponents.  If he loses a part from an old top -- too bad:  He can't take from the new ones.  The battery operated launcher I bought just a few months ago is now worthless.  My son is aware of the differences, and is as disappointed as I am.  MY MESSAGE TO THE BEAN COUNTER WHO RUINED THIS TOY:  WE WILL NOT BE BUYING MORE.  We have no more trust in your brand.  Congratulations.  I hope you add that to your profit calculations.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|I guess i must be a little off to call this my favorite movie.  well i'm a fan of the most extreme films out there.  and this is one of them.  then again, ive asked many people who live in my town and theyve seen the film.  so it seems that underground gore snuff porn films are now coming to the suface?  what happened?  i guess its going to take a film with 100 times more sick perversion to shake the world since now i think we are now used to films like this.  which makes me wonder what underground torture porn film will be like 20 years from now.  (terrifying thought huh?)  the only thing you need to know about this film is that they rape a newborn baby, a dad rapes his son and a man has sex with a girl while cutting her head off.  THEY SHOW EVERYTHING I JUST DESCRIBED!  ONLY IN THE UNCUT VERSION.  i saw the uncut version online for free.  i was absoulutley blown away.  truley a distubing perverse film covered in filth.  i loved it.  other snuff horror porn films i would suggest, \\"the vomit gore trilogy\\" \\"the august underground trilogy\\" check em out!

B0055Q5F36|5.0|Saw that this case would fit my new S2, so I popped for it quick. Like others have pointed out, for this phone, the screen protector is incorrect, but it's irrelevant beyond noting that you'll need a different one.<br />The fit on this case is perfect. Nice and snug with no movement. Easy to hold for me, but I have large hands and prefer something I can grip. Still fits into my shirt pockets easily, so that's good. The extra layer of protection has already paid off. I've dropped this onto tile floor twice this week, and it doesn't seem to matter. The phone takes no harm and is fine.<br />Overall, I've found no flaws for me and love this case. I'm glad I bought this one.
0375842209|4.0|Set in Nazi Germany during the hardships of World War II, this exciting novel gives the reader an insight into the special relationship that developed between a young girl and a Jew who spent several years in hiding in the basement of the house where the girl lived with her foster parents.
0385344228|5.0|DEFENDING JACOB, by William Landay, is a riveting legal thriller about the worst thing that can happen to a father: his 8th grade son is accused of murder. The novel is told from the entire point of view of Andy Barber, an assistant district attorney in a suburban Massachusetts. Two stories are told, one in the future after everything has happened and Andy is testifying in front of the grand jury. We have no idea really what he is being questioned for.<br /><br />The second timeline follows the discovery of the dead boy in the park by their house, the resulting investigation, and finally of their son Jacob. Andy is devastated that a baby that he cradled in his arms and rocked to sleep could turn possibly turn out to be a killer. But Andy is convinced he didn't do it, and evidence actually points to a nearby convicted child molester.<br /><br />While Jacob insists he's innocent, Andy and his wife Laurie occasionally have doubts as the evidence mounts. To complicate matters, there is a history of violence in Andy's family that goes back generations. Could Jacob be like the rest of his family? The novel careens towards a stunning conclusion that will take your breath away.<br /><br />This is a true 5-star page turner. A book you can't put down. My own son is in fourth grade, and four short years, he could be Jacob. The novel makes you wonder how much we really know our kids? How much can we truly control what they do? How much are we responsible?<br /><br />I feel that Andy Barber as the narrator of the story keeps us from really getting to know Jacob or his mom. But, Andy's angst, pain and torment is enough to carry the story. The ending is a surprise, and a shock, and one I didn't see coming. I give credit for Landlay's skills as an author to keep me riveted even though the story focuses only on Andy and the trial, and not really on any other characters.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Ignore the religious zealots. It's a pretty good movie. Watched it with some roommates. Thoroughly enjoyed it. What makes the movie good is its setting. They do a very good job of depicting a post-apocalyptic environment.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Now, I admit to the fact that I was barely born in 1973 when Springsteen released his first two albums. \\"Born to Run\\" was experienced second hand, much later. \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\", \\"The River\\" and \\"Nebraska\\" virtually unknown to me. However, for better or worse, no matter what you might think, it was 1984's \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" that put Springsteen in to my consciousness as an 11 year old kid. There was something about \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" that resonated with me, and seeing the video brought Springsteen up close and personal whereas previously he had been an enigma, an unknown. \\"Cover Me\\", \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", \\"I'm on Fire\\", \\"Glory Days\\", \\"I'm Going Down\\" and \\"My Hometown\\"--I liked them all, and there was no escaping Springsteen in 1984/1985.<br /><br />Still, it really wasn't until 1987's \\"Tunnel of Love\\" that I actually bought a Springsteen album. That album became a part of my daily existence at age 14/15. The dissolution of his marriage resonated with my first real relationship dissolution, plus it echoed back to me my parents' divorce a decade earlier. It was at that point that I consciously decided to hop on the Springsteen wagon for better or worse.<br /><br />Springsteen re-married and suddenly, it seemed to me, his music became washed out. I mean, 1992's \\"Human Touch\\" and \\"Lucky Town\\" were weak. 1995's \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" fell completely flat for me. 2002's \\"The Rising\\" felt forced and overrated to me. 2005's \\"Devils & Dust\\" seemed average. 2007's \\"Magic\\" seemed to recapture a little of that Springsteen mojo, but not entirely. 2009's \\"Working on a Dream\\" felt ham-fisted and overblown.<br /><br />Then I began to hear rumor of \\"Wrecking Ball\\". The rumors were that Springsteen was angry, he was vital again, and then the preliminary rumors of a great piece of work began creeping in. I was ready, and Springsteen has not disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Wrecking Ball\\" for me, is Springsteen at his near best. He has something to sing and write about finally. I thought that might have happened with \\"The Rising\\", but for some strange reason that album dodged all the hard issues for me. But \\"Wrecking Ball\\", Springsteen charges full steam ahead. Most of the songs are about the shambles our country is in due to greedy bankers and politicians (which is the truth people). But it also addresses us, the working people who keep this country operational whilst we get the short end of the financial rewards stick (which is also the truth). Of course the irony of millionaire wealthy Springsteen telling me about my country is not lost on me. Yet, what I know of Springsteen is that he did not start from millionaire roots, and he was not an overnight millionaire (a la Justin Bieber). No, Springsteen had to work hard for his fans, he had to tour, tour, tour and build a fanbase unlike today's artists who instantly get YouTube/Twitter/Facebook cult followers in an instant.<br /><br />So, when Springsteen says \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\", there's an element of patriotism that rings true. When he says he feels \\"Shackled and Drawn\\", I could identify with the sentiment that I, along with many others, are not financially well off. When Springsteen sings about the \\"Death to My Hometown\\" it feels like a sequel to \\"My Hometown\\"--a continuation of what happened later. When Springsteen sings about \\"My Depression\\" this is as direct as an artist can get about the current climate in America. \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is Springsteen's gauntlet thrown down--show me what you got. Bring it. \\"Rocky Ground\\" is a somber reflection upon post-bubble bursting America and the need to persevere (with a rap embedded in it!) \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" and \\"We Are Alive\\" are two more inspiring \\"Born to Run\\" type tracks that offer reassurance, plus revisit dead and gone leaders who pushed this country forward. The two bonus tracks add to the album rather than subtract from it. I personally liked \\"American Land\\" the best of the two with its sentiments about immigrants and outsiders dying for this country and how we seem to always forget this fact.<br /><br />Generally speaking, \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is Springsteen in his element, that artist who gave us \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Nebraska\\" and \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", those reflective, hopeful, patriotic songs are here again. And musically speaking, this is Springsteen's strongest work since, dare I say it, \\"Tunnel of Love\\".<br /><br />I seldom award five stars to any album I listen to, and each year I listen to more than anyone I know who isn't getting paid to listen to music. I honestly debated all week long as I listened to \\"Wrecking Ball\\" whether it deserved five stars or not. I saw Rolling Stone gave it five stars (something uncommon for them), but I still debated with myself. In the end, after repeated listening, I decided \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is, in fact, a five star album, and I hope Springsteen gets a ton of Grammy awards and end of year accolades for this fine piece of work. This seems unexpected to me as Springsteen will turn 62 this year, and most people are retiring rather than stoking their fires and recharging their batteries, something Springsteen has simply done here. A late career jewel. I almost have trouble deleting it from my song rotation to move on to the next two albums in my queue. That's rare that I want to keep listening to an album after I've finished reviewing it.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Wrecking Ball\\" compares to Springsteen's other works:<br /><br />1973 Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.: Three Stars<br />1973 The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle: Three and a Half Stars<br />1975 Born To Run: Four Stars<br />1978 Darkness on the Edge of Town: Four Stars<br />1980 The River: Four and a Half Stars<br />1982 Nebraska: Five Stars<br />1984 Born in the U.S.A.: Five Stars<br />1987 Tunnel of Love: Four Stars<br />1992 Human Touch: Two and a Half Stars<br />1992 Lucky Town: Two and a Half Stars<br />1995 The Ghost of Tom Joad: Three Stars<br />2002 The Rising: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 Devils & Dust: Three Stars<br />2006 We Shall Overcome: Four Stars<br />2007 Magic: Four Stars<br />2009 Working on a Dream: Three Stars<br />2012 Wrecking Ball: Five Starsders dying for this country and how we seem to always forget this fact.<br /><br />Generally speaking, \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is Springsteen in his element, that artist who gave us \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Nebraska\\" and \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", those reflective, hopeful, patriotic songs are here again.

B002N83H52|5.0|I found this to be a fascinating, and very well written book.  It gives you a very nice feeling for what it's like to be a rare book collector, as well as a rare book seller.  There are lots of \\"insider\\" nuggets that only intrigued me to learn more about how to collect and appreciate rare books.<br />In addition, the story of Gilkey vs. Sanders is well documented and very well researched.  I didn't get the impression that she was glorifying Gilkey at all!  I was left with the impression that he's an unbalanced man with no concept of ownership rights.  He exists in a fantasy world, where he is entitled to all of his desires at no cost to himself.<br /><br />Sanders, the dealer who ultimately helps bring Gilkey to justice, (at least for awhile), is presented as a complex man.  He is definitely the hero of the book, but he has his own quirks and faults, and these are shown by the author as they occurred in her dealings with the man.<br />I suspect that those who hated the book are projecting their own frustrations with crime in the rare book trade.  Too often the theft of a rare book is unappreciated by police/judges/juries, and the thieves walk away with little or no incentive to mend their ways. While Bartlett addresses this at length, I think booksellers may see any presentation of Gilkey as a betrayal.<br /><br />As a book lover, I never really was interested in pursuing first editions.  However, after reading this book, I'm eager to begin my own collection!  I found a website for ABAA member bookstores and even bought my first \\"rare\\" book. (A first edition, first printing of \\"Some Kind of Hero\\" by James Kirkwood with an inscription by the author!) In my opinion, any book about books that can inspire the reader in this manner is not only good for the trade, but a damn good read in the bargain!

B004LWZW8I|5.0|Zeus has trained a man to fight (Theseus), he kept himself disguised as an old man. Theseus only knew him as a friend, not a god. The gods cannot directly become involved with man, not even to aid them, unless the Titans are released. In this film, the titans are defeated gods themselves, kept imprisoned in Mount Tartarus. A Tyrannous mortal man named Hyperion is searching for the one item that will release the titans, The Epirus bow. He wants the release of the Titans to fulfill a personal vendetta he has against the gods. Hyperion's men refer to him as their king, though he denounces the name.<br /><br />Let's go ahead and get one thing about the Immortals out in the open. It is a violent movie. I knew that the nature of the film meant violence, but it was easily the year's most violent film. It wasn't the shear amount of killing that was going on at any given time; it was some of the methods used to kill. King Hyperion, for example, kills his seer by gouging his eyes out with his thumbs as he was cradling his head. Three spiritual but powerful women (foes of Hyperion) are placed in a cow shaped oven and slowly cooked over a small, open fire when they refuse to give the location of the oracle. A monk cuts out his own tongue as Hyperion is about to torture him in an attempt to find the Epirus bow. Yes, the movie is violent, but the men committing the acts are labeled by their deeds, and they are portrayed exactly as they are supposed to be, the worst kind of men imaginable, the kind which sadly still exist.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke plays as the villainous Hyperion, and puts forth a very entertaining and impressive performance. As much as you might hate the tyrant king, there is something unsettlingly charming about him. Theseus is played by Henry cavil, who was especially comfortable with his role. The acting is great in this film and most of the contributors obviously wanted the film to be great. The gods were suitably arrogant, the peasants humble, even Theseus, the peasant that fought like he could destroy an army with his bare hands.<br /><br />I won't spoil too much, but Theseus does find the bow before Hyperion. It is a cool bow, but ultimately serves as only a key, not a game changer (he gets the most use out of it five minutes after he finds it). Theseus is open in his disbelief of the gods for the first half of the movie. Upon finding the bow, he has a change of faith. He loses the bow and Hyperion gains control of it. At the climax of the film, two armies of men are fighting each other, Theseus and Hyperion are fighting their own private battle, and the gods are fighting the titans. The film very smoothly transitions from slower paced scenes that fill in details of the rapidly developing plot, to faster scenes of in-your-face action.<br /><br />There is a lot of cleverness going on here that is easily missed. Perhaps my favorite part of the film finds Theseus in a maze-like crypt, fighting a very large man who wears a bull-shaped mask. It seemed to me like the labyrinth and the Minotaur, another legend that begins with this film. It was very clever and subtle. If I have one criticism it would be that the film is too subtle sometimes. If you watch but aren't paying the fullest attention, you will miss plot elements, and never know you missed them.<br /><br />What this movie has done most successfully, has given a beginning to man's legend of the Greek gods. It has made this beginning as believable as possible while still injecting an appropriate level of Hollywood magic. It is action packed, entertaining, and thought provoking. We loved this film, just don't let the kids watch, or even hear it.

0060873027|1.0|I have read several Crichton books. This one had none of his styling or finesse. While it would make an ok mindless action movie the story was full of scientific holes and rediculous (and predictable) plot twists. On top of that it was clearly written with an adult audience in mind but the actual writting was far from the maturity that I've come to expect from Crichton's books. The descriptions seem like the author is trying too hard to be graphic in several situations. The author puts way too much effort in explaining simple situations and not enough developing the characters or story line. Unlike Jerassic park I felt like saying, \\"really? Another attack from a bug?\\"

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I downloaded this game after hearing the hype about it and how addictive this casual game is,  and while I will not deny the game is fairly fun for brief gaming sessions, I do not think it is so fun that it deserves all the attention that it has received.  Part of my issue with the game is with the fact that I have a lower end phone(Samsung Galaxy Prevail), and that it is slow on this phone,  and the game doesn't scale well on the fairly small screen.  It also seems that the app sometimes seems buggy with it's response when  dragging the bird around to aim, letting it go too early without limited lifting my finger,  and not activating the birds powers at the first touch after shooting them some of the time.<br />  On the other end,  the premise for the game is neat and the gameplay is fun for 5 or 10 minutes at time.  Considering both the issues and the pros of this game,  I rate it 3 stars.

0689504764|5.0|If I were forced to pick just fifty children's books to take with my wife and me and a group of kids to a deserted island, this one be right on that list.  It has just about ever thing I look for in a read for the wee ones.<br /><br />Now one thing you should know right now and something you should be delighted with, is that unlike so many books written for children that are based on old songs and stories, this one has stayed true to the original song that most of us grew up with.  It is an old song and Michael Rosen's interpretation of this old tale is spot on.  This particular work was published in 1989 but the song and tale is from a much earlier time.  I can remember singing it and various versions of it when I was a child and that folks, was a long, long time ago.<br /><br />\\"We're going on a bear hunt,<br />We're going to catch a big one.<br />What a beautiful day!<br />We're not scared.\\"<br /><br />When read to children, the reader needs to put a bit of themselves into this one.  I have read this work to many children and have personally found that if I chant the words as they are written, in particular for the first few readings, the kids readily pick-up on it and before long will be chanting and singing right along with you.<br /><br />The story is simple.  A father and his four children (Including the baby) begin an adventure and go out into the wide world to find a bear...they are going on a bear hunt!  Please keep in mind that this nice family is not hunting the bear in the traditional way.  There are no guns or high tech hunting gear.  No, they are simply (More or less through their imagination) trying to find a bear...a big one!<br /><br />On their journey they first encounter \\"long, wavy grass.\\"  \\"Oh, no! We've got to go through it!\\"<br /><br />\\"Swishy swashy!<br />Swishy swashy!<br />Swishy swashy!\\"<br /><br />It is a beautiful day but \\"We're not scared.\\"<br /><br />Next comes a cold deep river they must get over or under or though.  Then a large area of oozy mud.  Next comes a forest and then a snow storm and then a \\"narrow, gloomy cave!\\"  Yup you guest it!  They find there bear and of course the bear gives chase back through all of the hazards they have already encountered.  The bear chases them all the way to their home where they hop into bed and all hide under the covers...including the dog!<br /><br />\\"We're not going on a bear hunt again!\\"<br /><br />While this might seem a scary story, it really isn't.  If a kid is scared while reading this, then it is the adult reader's fault for not presenting the book in the light hearted way it should be presented.  This is a fun book and due to the wonderful illustrations by Helen Oxenbury, it is a funny book that kids will appreciate and enjoy! A certain amount of excitement can be built in by the reader and if effective read can led the child on a wonderful little adventure of the mind.  I cannot stress enough the importance of presentation of this book when you read it to the young ones.<br /><br />If you have not already treated your children to this one, and indeed, yourself, then you should do so.

B003AMAOW4|3.0|A wonderful performance, all the singers are fabulous, especially Jonas Kaufmann as Lohengrin. However, I cannot say a good word for the producion, that is the work of the director. He put this highly romantic and religious story of Richard Wagner into the 20. century and the time of Hitler. The plot has nothing to do with that whatsoever,  and the production is absolutely abominable. A waste of very good orchestra musicians and singers.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is so much fun!  You never get bored because you always earn new games! The entire family loves it!
0439023521|5.0|This is one of the rare books that grabs you from the first chapter and doesn't let go.  I had a hard time putting this book down! I found it interesting that the author was able to have me cheer on the main characters without reveling or being in any way happy about the demise of the others.  In fact this book made me tear up a couple times - which is highly unusual for me!  The author paints very clear pictures in few words. You get to know the characters in sprinklings of information given in just the right doses throughout the book.<br /><br />If I have a complaint, it's that the ending was vaguely anti-climactic and abrupt, but I suppose that's to be expected when there's another book or two following. How the people \\"back home\\" are reacting to the games is left to the imagination a little more than I'd liked, until I realized they were probably reacting just like I was as the reader - helpless to stop it, but can't look away even for a second.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is a truly great album! It's Uncle Tom's Cabin. It's Thomas Paine's Common Sense set to music--rock music! Can music save your moral soul?<br /><br />Little Steven and Mr. Springsteen are autodidactic scholars. They know American history, and they know global history. They also are artists--artists as good as any America has ever produced.<br /><br />Wrecking Ball is an album with a fierce commitment to the Bill of Rights, to the Progressives of the early twentieth century, and to all in human history that has been wise and good. Any Springsteen fans ever watch Jamie Johnson's film The One Percent?<br /><br />I love Mr. Springsteen for his idealism, his faith, his commitment to truth and to beauty. I am saddened by so many Amazon reviewers that seemingly don't understand the obvious.<br /><br />Springsteen stayed out of politics and commercialism for most of his career. Some E-Street band members weren't permitted to do commercials, and Ronald Reagan couldn't use \\"Born In the U.S.A.\\" as his campaign song.<br /><br />So it was significant when Springsteen committed himself to a specific side in the 2008 presidential election. He performed with Pete Seeger at the White House.<br /><br />How long ago those 2008 days seem!<br /><br />Have Springsteen fans watched the Best of the Smothers Brothers DVD in which Seeger appears on their show in 1967, twice? Do Springsteen fans recognize the significance of Bruce's connection with Seeger?<br /><br />Anyone with ears to hear recognized several layers of meaning in the lyric of \\"Wrecking Ball\\" when it was first played at the Giants' Stadium.<br /><br />Yes, Woody Guthrie is long gone. And Bob Dylan--well, these days he DJs.<br /><br />But Seeger lives! And his spirit will always rise, standing shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart!<br /><br />And Neil Young springs eternal!<br /><br />And Springsteen also springs eternal!<br /><br />I myself will stand up and be counted. What about you Amazonians?<br /><br />Wrecking Ball  is dedicated to the 99%. How many of the 99% recognize that they truly are a part of it?<br /><br />I recall an anecdote about Soviet visitors to the U.S. during the cold war. They were amazed at how the U.S. had managed to achieve consensus without the use of force. In their circles, they had to use heavy-handed force.<br /><br />We've now got seven-football-field-length heat guns; we've got drones, and Patriot-Act ubiquitous surveillance. We would scare the daylights out of George Orwell.<br /><br />To anyone for whom my words here make sense, I say crank up loudly your copy of Wrecking Ball. When one reaches a certain level of greatness, it makes no sense to nitpick.<br /><br />And it's no longer six degrees of separation. We're down to three or two. In the off chance that Mr. S. might read my words here, I mention in passing that in 1996, I taught a girl (Tracy H.) for whom your mother babysat. I guess for years your mom sent her family Christmas cards.<br /><br />Yes, we're all neighbors and brothers.<br /><br />A few years ago, I danced with my wife literally three feet away from the rocking Grushecky in Sellersville, PA--what a great concert that was! But nobody else seemed to know who Grushecky was! It's the music, not the celebrity! It's the music!<br /><br />America, there's no such thing as celebrity! We're all supposed to be equals in this democracy! Copyrights were meant to last twenty-eight years!<br /><br />You can do something as the 99% if you'd believe in the Bill of Rights--if you'd self-educate, if you'd get fired up by the brilliance of Wrecking Ball!<br /><br />We aren't just Dancing in the Dark!  It's not Diebold--it's Die Bold!<br /><br />Just kidding.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so fun. plus the best thing is that it doesnt need wi-fi to play which rocks because it will work for grandparents or long car rides.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|With shallow writing, a weak story, and endless boring sex scenes, this book is a throw away after twenty pages. A waste of time and money. This book should have a more daring cover and sell for $3.95 in the local porn shop.<br /><br />Sorry bout that....virg
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game a lot love the dansers good game like I said loves it I'm 6 years old jk g2g beylol kk
B002N5N5R0|1.0|Terrible purchase,i started watching it and the second disk doesn't play.I have to go to best buy and purchase another one.should have gone there first
0060873027|1.0|What a disappointment. Same basic story as \\"Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves,\\" with more technology and a tropical setting instead of a back yard. Hard to believe this was Crichton's vision for the book.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|nothing too involving. you have to spend money to get a lot of the extra bells and whistles but seems to be the rule rather than the exception with these types of games. still i find myself spend more time than is wise on playing this
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I should have read the other reviews first.  It would not work ever.  I tried all of the troubleshooting, changed batteries (very hard), tried on multiple devices, etc.  It still would not work.  I recommend not buying it.  It did not even match the picture; the audio input is an inline and not a right angle input like the picture shows.  That might sound trivial, but if you portray something in a picture, you should provide what is shown in the picture.  Save your time; find another mic.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|just a fun game.  a couple of parts needed help figuring out, but just really enjoyed it.  good time killer.

B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden's Powerslave is one of the band's best albums and one of their greatest accomplishments!! From the great Egyptian album cover to the 13-min. epic \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\", it's a flawless album, containing some of their best work! It's one of those albums that keeps on getting better and better everytime I listen to it!<br /><br />Aces High: A song that starts with a bang! This song is about British fighter pilots flying into the sky, destroying their enemies in sight! Like I said, it's a song that starts with a bang. Doesn't really packs a punch, bu has great Metal material.<br /><br />2 Minutes to Midnight: Another great song. This song is a reference of the Doomsday Clock when it reached 2 minutes to midnight, the closest we've reached to be innihilated by a Nuclear War. It has an amazing intro, Bruce's vocals are amazing, and has great material.<br /><br />Losfer Words (Big 'Orra): This is Iron Maiden's last instrumental song, and I really wish it wasn't. The song has a progressive structure in the music, and went a different direction than previous instrumental songs in the Paul Di'Anno era. Obviously their best instrumental song.<br /><br />Flash of the Blade: It has an amazing intro that sounds like it could be used in a Randy Rhoads solo. The weird thing about this song is it's about fencing! It's kind of a weird topic for a Heavy Metal song, but with great vocals, great riffs and great intro, it works.<br /><br />The Duellists: I wasn't a big fan of this song when I first listened to it. I kind of thought the bridge was kind of weird, and/or Bruce's vocal notes sounds forcingly high. But it has a great solo, and I love it now after I don't kno how many listens.<br /><br />Back in the Village: Another song I wasn't a big fan of. The chorus kind of sounds weird, and the lyrics weren't always top notched. But I love the solo, and love the verses! I guess this song had to grow on me, and with that it did.<br /><br />Powerslave: The second best track on the album! The song's about a Pharaoh that is ruled and worshipped as a God. When it was his time for him to die, he protested that he's suppose to be immortal, and he'll become \\"a slave to the Power of Death.\\" The song keeps on getting nastier with each verse and chorus, with a soft and soon amazing solo that balances the song.<br /><br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner: The true gem of the album!!! The song is based on a really old poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge by the same name that's about a Mariner who is cursed because he killed an albatross that supposed to bring good omen. This song is Iron Maiden's longest song to date, clocking at 13:36. Although it's long, every member gave out some of their best material, and every minute is worth it!! One of their best!<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a really great album!!! I find it really addicting because I listen to it all the time!<br />I can't say that this is their best album because when it comes to their albums, it's all about opinion. If you're a huge metal fan and love Iron Maiden, run to the nearest CD store, and buy it because you'll definitely get your money's worth with this album!! UP THE IRONS!!!track on the album!

B004V5QWU2|5.0|I'm a chronic insomniac &amp; cannot sleep in a silent room. I often slept with the TV on, which lit up the whole room &amp; drove my boyfriend crazy. This app has been a life saver for me! I especially love that I can blend different sounds. I can create soundscapes that remind me of pleasant places &amp; memories...a camping trip on the lake, the sound of the city at night, sleeping in the car on a cross-country drive. I can let the app play softly in the background and let the sounds form pleasant pictures in my mind, carrying me off to sleep. I'm sleeping well for the first time in years. I recommend this app to anyone who suffers from insomnia!

0743201140|5.0|I have truly found this book insightful and helpful in understanding both myself and others.  The book includes an online personal survey which provides very specific details about talents and natural abilities that are so pervasive and unique within each of us that we unconciously apply them both at work and in our private lives.<br /><br />Unlike virtually all behavioral profiles that divide people into quadrants of behavior with 16 subsets, Gallup has done extensive research over the decades identifying 34 predominent strengths and shares the readers top five.  These represent 32 million iterations and really isolate an individuals tendencies and talents.<br /><br />Reading the discripters and thinking about co workers, friends and family members provides insight and specific strategies for optimizing that which we love doing anyway and helps me be more effective interacting with others.<br /><br />Of all the books I've read in my life on personal development this one has had the greatest impact.

B001QUL73W|1.0|I hesitate to critique in any negative manner. My reviews are usually motivated by the desire to share something special and make others aware of its worth. This disc, however, is a great disappointment. Shostakovich's music is surely not at fault. It is the sound level of this recording that destroys the experience. I played this disc on 3 different devices and just could not hear huge segments of the music. It took several minutes into the first movement before any instruments could be heard. It was as though nothing was playing. Even raising the sound level to maximum barely allowed me to discern if there was in fact any music actually there. I then purchased a different recording of the work, and have greatly enjoyed listening at my usual sound volume. I would avoid this Naxos disc, as it is a waste of money.

B007JF87VS|5.0|This show will hook you from the first few minutes. Each episode gets better and better.  Plot twists and turns abound. Acting is incredible. Awesome special effects. The only problem is that there are too few shows, with too much time between seasons.

B006YXTRHY|4.0|For those of you who have read the books, it's kind of required to watch the movies. Even though we all know the movie is never as good as the book, we still have hope. Now, if you're in it just to see the cool graphics, clothes, compare your vision to real-life, then fine, this should be a lovely movie for you. You know what's going on and you are prepared to judge the movie.<br />The real test of a book-gone-bigsceen film is if people would still watch it even if the book hadn't been famous beforehand. (Alice In Wonderland, anyone? Eragon?). Sadly, I do not believe this series of films would be a success in that case. If you completely ignore the books, the movie is decent. The graphics are good, but they aren't seamless. You can tell what is fake, and you can see it not matching perfectly with what is real. I'm always annoyed when that happens. It's like those photos you see of people pretending to hold the Statue of Liberty or something in their hand. Yeah it looks cool at first but when you look close it's easy to see you're just holding your hand close to the camera, far away from the object you're pretending to hold.<br />Anyway, if you do factor the books into the equation, the movies really fail. It's not just having a different internal expectation than what is on the screen; it's that basic facts were completely overlooked. What's rule number one of Cullen world? Everyone is perfect. But does that hold true in the movies? Nope! I see sunspots/moles, acne, and general non-attractiveness. Makeup and airbrushing could have solved that, but no one did it. Rule number two? They aren't human. So why do they tremble? Why do their hands shake ever so slightly when they pick things up, just like humans do? Some brushups could have covered that. The whole feel is supposed to be inhuman, but that just doesn't come across at all. Even when they park their cars it isn't perfect. They're just as crooked as the other 'humans'. Again, easy to fix, yet it wasn't done. Ruins the whole effect for me. I expect attentention to detail, and it just isn't there.<br />Next, we move onto errors. Obviously movie people can't just take the book and make it into a movie. That would be too simple, right? They have to add and subtract their own scenes until it all bears just a passing resemblence to the books. Which is fine if you're approaching the movies without first reading the books, but since most of us have all ready read the books...<br />Finally, the actual characters. They fail. Sorry. Let's start with Bella. I've all ways liked Bella. She can be a little whiny, but other than that she's great. She's supposed to be sweet, innocent. Wanting to help everyone and everything. The movie? She's a tough little tomboy. There is no sweetness their. She's like the tough girl in highschool everyone knew, smoking out behind the school,  out playin' with the boys all the time. Decent girl, but all ways took herself too seriously. We all knew she'd marry a redneck and spend her days howling at her pack of sons whenever they got to roughhousing, cigarette hanging from her fingers. This is not the Belle portrayed in the book. But it's what you get in the movies.<br />Next we have Edward. He's the same way. You expect Mr. Proper, and you get wanna-be tough chick's boyfriend. His speech is not what you'd expect from a man who was born a century ago. I mean, I don't expect him to be proper at all times, but he at least has to know how to do it when needed, and you just don't get the sense that he does. There's no 'ancient' feel. He isn't special.<br />Moving onto Alice. Seriously, what happened? Tiny little pixie girl has turned into normal sized girl. I mean, she's taller than Bella at times! There's nothing pixie-like about her at all. She's average.<br />Now Carlisle is someone I like. I think his character fits the part very well. His features can convey the sense of perfection the vampires so needed. You actually get an inhuman feel from him.<br />Asfor the wolves, eh. Graphics could have been better. I've seen better work with dragons, and I'm fairly certain dragons are harder to create than a wolf. You rarely get the feeling that the wolves are really 'there'. They dont' mesh together with the real characters. It breaks the effect.<br />The graphics and sounds were something I expected to be perfection. They weren't. Whenever anyone jumps up to a window, you get this horrible 'whoosh'ing sound, and the graphics fail to make it look real. The running is so terribly awkward as well. I don't care if they think it's how it looks. It just doesn't look real. Believable.<br />And that's about it for the facts that were missed. :D I won't bother to get into how my personal visions didn't match with the big screen. :)
B005VTS4EY|5.0|its a lot of fun. very addicting. its annoying that it kept bugging me to review it and cutting into my game. thats review mongering, but the gme is fun.
1848378963|5.0|One of the best novels I have read in a long time. Packed with intrigue from the first pages with characters to match. A Gothic manor, a young artist sent to that dark, forboding house to mentor two young ladies in art, teaching them drawing. Meanwhile,in the same house, is the brooding, frail old man who is the charge of these two young women.<br /><br />And then also introduced in the very first pages is the strange, obviously troubled young woman all dressed in white whom the young artist meets on a rural road on a dark night.<br /><br />This is a page turner to the end, though does bog down a bit in the middle with perhaps too much detail. I loved the fact that the author was educated as a lawyer, though never practiced, for there is enough legalese thrown into to plot to make it even more fascinating.  The author was a friend and colleague of Charles Dickens and in my book as good a writer as the more famous Dickens.<br /><br />No wonder Victorian England was captured by this story which was serialized by a magazine that Dickens owned. Those stuffy English of that period  (including the Royals)awaited with bated breath for the next installment. Be sure to read the history behind the book that is included in the front of the book. My rating: all thumbs up!
0061564893|5.0|A must read for anyone interested in world history. Very convincing argument. Pure pleasure.<br /><br />Menzies could have done a better job if he had some background in the Chinese language.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Having read the books many times over the years, I feared that Disney would not do the books justice. Those behind the camera must have loved the stories as much as I did. They have succeeded in capturing Burrough's Barsoom perfectly. I give this movie an A+. Extremely well done! Going back to see it again with wife, today. Will purchase the 3D Bluray the very day it becomes available. You should see this film on a big screen! You will not be disappointed. Best 3D movie I have yet to see. The only people that are slamming this movie are those that are ignorant of the Burrough's stories. This will go up there with my LOTR BluRay collection (extended version). I really hope they make this movie the first of the trilogy (A Princess of Mars, followed by The Gods of Mars and Warlord of Mars).

B001974DG0|5.0|I first read Watchers in my mid-twenties. In the more than twenty years since, I have read hundreds and hundreds of books, but none have meant as much to me. I have gone back time and time again to revisit Travis and Nora and Einstein and even The Outsider. Read this novel now, and it will stay with you for always.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Loved reading this last book but it was \\"parting is such sweet sorrow\\" for me as I knew the love story I have grown to crave was about to end...Its a great series girls and guys..a must read.  I am currently re-reading the books now and have a better understanding of certain things as I re-read. Crossing fingers and hoping there will be a movie! ;)
B0006N2EZ0|2.0|The movie looks and feels like a bad reproduction.  Started watching the movie and half way through it, lines and scratches started to appear.  Glad I only paid $8.00 for the movie, but that was still too much.  Would think twice before I order a movie again from this website.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|App is fine however, I don't like the constant way you have to take the extra steps to clear the notifications. I know it's gonna be windy today for the sixth time. Why can't I just clear it like I can everything else...with my CLEAR button!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As a child of the 80's this book brought back a lot of memories for me.  Plus it's got a cool near-future premise, awesome 80's references (My favorite is Wade's first passphrase to log into his system), an abundance of unabashed nerdiness, all with a touch of action and a hint of awkward romance.  I couldn't put this book down!
145162445X|5.0|If you want to learn the latest in cosmology, this book is an excellent summary. The points are clearly made, and thoroughly convincing. As another reviewer has pointed out, perhaps its weakest point is the lack of a good bibliography -- which ideally would contain some references to general relativity, which is still mysterious to many people. Also, he gives atomic abundances computed from the big bang -- but with no discussion nor references as to how these numbers are obtained. Still, this information would be of more value to the technician than to the general audience toward which this book is directed.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|It's very time consuming yet fun. It's worth the price that you pay.  Only downfall is that you can buy everything in the shop pretty fast.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had to get on here and put a review of five stars after finishing this series.  You can not go wrong with this series, just buy it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun to play and keeps you wanting to go to each new level. Nice graphics and a very soothing zen feel.
0439023521|4.0|After the first two chapters, I couldn't put it down. I'm at chapter 22 in less than 3 days. I take it everywhere I go, and read during my spare time. Nice depth on main characters. Decent setting descriptions. Riveting plot. Mostly realistic survival scenarios.<br /><br />Highlights a few currently relevant social issues - global warming, public lust for gratuitous violence, trauma experienced by child soldiers (somewhat shallow coverage), the oppression and arrogance bred by wealth and unchecked power, wealth distribution disparity, varying behavioral responses to competition over dwindling resources, and all with a humorous jab at \\"reality\\" TV.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the other two.
B007BDK3SS|2.0|This game has a great concept, but unfortunately, the god-awful controls completely take away from the experience. It almost feels like this is QWOP with motorcycles. I managed to play through up to level 5 before I couldn't stand to use either the tilt or the button controls.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|fun game.  nice screen shots. like how seasons change and you find new rooms.  always could be longer but this was definitely one of the better aneroid aps!
B0053F042G|4.0|This is a decent movie, one I will probably buy to add to my movie collection. Amazon's VOD works very well with our Sony network player.
B005UG542S|3.0|We purchased this movie for our son to complete his Harry Potter collection. Don't ever waste extra money on the Ultra-Violet Copy this is worse than regular Digital Copy and that I thought was a big ripoff anyway. At least the regular Digtital Copy could be added to iTunes but this new format doesn't work with anything.
B0041OJ0Y8|4.0|Its a new spin on hip hop.. good stuff.  The dj has some good beats.  I like ninja..its not supposed to be overly serious.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am starting to love this game more and more as I play it! It has become a good therapy for me.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Loved Miss Potter so much that we decided to buy extra copies to share with our grand daughters.  We know that they will have fun watching this movie and will want to read Miss Potters story books. Beautifully photographed and very well acted.  A must for any library.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This took me two days to read, I couldn't put it down. On my lunch break in the car and at home...It kept me interested. I have to say I wish there was a 4 and a half star rating because it wasn't perfect but I didn't just like it. I felt like I knew the story already. With minor twists, it reminded me of the movie Enough with Jennifer Lopez.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent app! You can choose from many different translations, pick a Bible reading plan and make notes and bookmark favorite passages of scripture.
B007JFLHRE|5.0|Great remake of Red Ridding hood. I don't want to say anything else, but this short episode was exactly what I wanted when I saw the red ridding hood movie, something different. I love GrandMa really strong performance by this lady.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is a great waste of time and not in a negative way. I can play these games while watching TV or listening to music and they still work my brain and give me hours of entertainment for free. Really couldn't ask for better.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's a great game. Yet I don't know how to play half of the starting games. I keep trying and there are no directions so I get really confused. They need to make directions for the individual games.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a pretty good game but some people don't like it I guess they should make it better like adding better games to it

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I purchased this for an exciting surprise gift for my boyfriend. he is not a TREKIE per say but he does love the original Star Trek. I bought this and he was watching it within 2 hours of our daughter falling asleep. He was surprised to see that there were episodes on the 1st disc alone that he hadnt seen ever. He hasnt even gotten to the other discs as of yet but I am sure he will be viewing them at every chance he gets.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|The amount of things that this app can do is truly astounding. I learned about the geometrical features of a soccer ball, methods of encryption, my name, the GDP of Russia, China, and the USA, and I learned about the human genome. All in about an hour of use.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Great short novelette.  As usual, Stephen's imagination runs wild with an entertaining story.  As in his other stories, you feel as though you were there.  It captured me.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|This is my absolute favorite CD.  I like to turn it on while doing my artwork. It is soft, nostalgic, romantic, relaxing, and it makes me feel as if I am living in my own perfect movie. My husband even loves it!  Some of the songs are piano with a little bit of violin - which I adore.  You won't regret purchasing this one.  I have another of Einaudi's CDs on the way!  Can't wait!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book held me captive until the very end.  It was like being there and experiencing everything myself.  Stephen never fails to entertain with his fantastic imagination and style of writing.  This will be one of my favorites along with other Stephen King novels.  Worth re-reading.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent puzzle game. Works fine on the HP Touchpad. It's very easy to spend way too much time playing this game. Ironically one of the biggest advantages is that you can pick it up and play for as little as 30 seconds, or as long as you want.
B000A88EVE|1.0|Imagine \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", but twice as long, with a less coherent plot, grating music, and even more howlers.  It's got assassins wearing matching gold-spangled motorcycle helmets.  A university professor who insults his department head with impunity, then happily goes from banging coeds to living in a Quonset hut in the desert with nothing to do.  Repeated images of people falling through space, some wearing shiny clothes.  And best of all, a girlfriend for the spaceman whose only advantageous attributes are a love of gin and the ability to pick up a grown man; too bad she never learned to call emergency services when someone has a massive, bleeding seizure.  I could go on but this movie already sucked 2 1/2 hours of my life away.
030726999X|2.0|Dust bunnies collected, laundry baskets overflowed, everything housewise came to a complete stop when I started the first two of Larsson's trilogy.  However, the third one leaves me cold.  There are more proper names than I can keep track of--worse than any Russian novel--and because of his sudden segues I find myself wondering who the hell is this character.<br /><br />I think what I so enjoyed in the first two novels is that Salander was truly the central character--in this one, she is relegated to a minor roll.<br /><br />I'm about half way through the book so perhaps this review is premature, or perhaps it's just me . . .
0765357151|1.0|I am not displeased with the company who sent me the book or Amazon, or anything like that.<br />This book however is terrible. This was the first book my book club has read and we all agreed to never read it again!<br />Also the first time any of us has ever been able to say that the MOVIE was actually better than the book!!! lol
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I rented this because of the reviews I had read and they did not disappoint me.  I loved this movie.  The Help was funny, sad, and inspiring.  I watched it from beginning to end in what seemed like a short time frame, because I was that into the story being told.  This is definitely a GREAT rental!!!

I REMEMBER VAGUALY IN A BEV BEVAN(THE DRUMMER)INTERVIEW W/SCOTT MUNI OF WNEW F.M.IN NYC BACK IN 1977 OR '78 IN WHICH BEV SAID THAT THE STRING ORCHESTRA PART WAS RECORDED TWICE OVER(OVERDUBBED)OR ON TOP OF EACH OTHER TO MAGNIFY THE SOUND OF THE ORCHESTRA.I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS TRUE.DOES ANYBODY OUT THERE KNOW IF THIS WAS HOW IT WAS RECORDED?PLEASE LET ME KNOW OR MAYBE HOW I CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THIS.THANKS.

B004XZR63M|5.0|i was inspired by this book to learn how to make \\"my money work for me\\" rather than \\"working for my money.\\"  this book will give you a feel for basic concepts of assets versus liabilities.  however, it won't teach you exactly how to invest your money or what different options are really about.  the point is to inspire you to read more and learn more so that when you do decide to start investing, it won't be as risky.  lack of knowledge is risky, but gaining knowledge reduces your risk simply by understanding what's going on.

B006H3MIV8|5.0|Many people are of the opinion that Dylan is more a songwriter than a singer.  For those people you have to own this, simply becuase you believe that this is the way to listen to Dylan.  For us others who love it when Dylan sings Dylan, I don't need to convince you to own this, you already know.  It should have you at the word \\"Dylan\\" cover for Amenesty International.  If you need a better reason look at the list of songs and artists.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I got this game for free and it is a blast.  If you aren't getting it as a deal of the day, its still worth it enough to pay for
B005LZW8FO|2.0|This movie only runs an hour and a half, but the dragging pace of the plot makes it feel like a minor eternity.  The characters aren't unsympathetic, but everything creeps along at such a low-key, glacial rate that by the time the story came to a merciful conclusion, I found it hard to muster much feeling for them one way or another.  The basic concept could have been interesting (\\"what *would* you say if you met yourself?\\"), if the story had been constructed so as to keep the viewer's attention, but it just wasn't happening.  There's a bit of tension leading up to the inevitable exposure of the \\"great deception,\\" and there's a very cool scene with a saw - but that's about the best I can say for it.<br /><br />Wish there had been more focus on the newly-discovered planet and perhaps getting a trip to \\"Earth 2\\" underway during the movie itself, rather than just having it be a background for the rest of the \\"action\\" (I use the term loosely), because that might have saved this movie and given it the electricity it needed to really showcase its theme.  I'm not bothered by the questionable realism of having a precisely parallel world existing in the solar system that had never been detected before (though it would have been fun to explore that issue in much more detail) - I am a sci-fi fan, so I can forgive a lot of questionable realism as long as the rest of the story keeps me engaged.  In this case, you will waste an hour and a half of your life on this film, and my advice is to watch something else, or read a good book.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I was skeptical when I was told this is a great series. I am not a TV watcher, but I was hooked on Breaking Bad from the first episode, and couldn't stop watching. Is it a drama, is it a comedy....it's everything! I started season one just last Christmas when we got a Roku box, and then I found out Season 5 will be the last! I am afraid of going through painful withdrawal without Jesse and Walt. I almost had a heart attack when I discovered the live streaming only goes through season 3 and made a mad search for season 4!! You must begin at the very beginning and watch EVERY episode!
B0012FB5SS|5.0|and I mean that. the new tracks add a new awesome to it, I can't listen to this album without the bonus tracks, it feels incomplete. I will admit that the one thing I am not happy with re-buying for 2 songs, but they deserve their money for this release. I'm just giving away my cds to my brother then.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is hilarious! got it as the free app of the day. recommend to everyone! great graphics and cool game play
B004T2QZL8|3.0|This game is so fun to play, but I am a little upset that I paid $3 for a game I cannot use! I guess it serves me right for not reading the reviews before purchasing though. My hope for the near future is that the developers address the issue with level of haste and speed that this awesome time waster deserves!
1469984202|5.0|This book totally made me into a Hugh Howey fan! I devoured the entire Omnibus Edition in a little under a week - quite a feat considering I have 3 small children at home and my only time for reading is somewhere between midnight and however long the book keeps me hooked into staying up! I even read the first Wool story out loud to my husband, because I absolutely had to have someone to share the amazing story with!<br /><br />The depth of this story is incredible. In a future where the outside world has been destroyed - rendered completely toxic, people exist inside a silo buried underground. There is a whole world created about this silo - from religious authorities who claim that the gods built the silo themselves, to incredibly tight population control, and the blurry camera lenses that provide the inhabitants of their only view of the outside world. I will be anxiously awaiting future Wool books...the continuation of this story as well as other stories from the Wool world (which he promises in his Q&A!). The most disappointing thing about these books is the fact that they end!
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|It is a good game I got hooked in a few minutes good upgrade system and somewhat funny. Like a more modern version of space invaders even has some space invaders reference in it. A well spent two bucks I recemend it to anyone that likes arcade games or likes space invaders
B00192KCQ0|2.0|There are a couple of moments but that is it! Most of the songs are boringly to long without any direction! But it is better than st anger. 1 That was just your life. I dont get it.2 End of the line is a rocker, I would describe it as half of a song! 3 broken beat just goes nowhere 4 the day that never comes is classic, I love this song 5 All nightmare long is good but again it could of been great. Its like they were on to something but then ran out of gas! 6 cylaide is a filler 7 the unforgiven 3 is ok 8 the judas kiss is a filler 9 Suicide and redemtion is the walk of shame here. the riff is taken from a jimi hendrix song.10 my apocaolipt is just ok. I know these guys are getting older and it shows.If they do not put out something maybe like priest did a concept cd or something to show these very talented guy and not lulu. Ha Ha! It will be the end of the line for these guys!

B005OYKIJ0|4.0|I have been a fan of the Fast and Furious since the beginning.  They lost their way on Tokyo Drift so I am glad to see redemption with this movie.  Great cast, it is the best of the best!  Action is amazing and the fight scene between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson is one of the best I have ever seen!  This movie is great eye candy for the ladies and all the action for the men!
B0063GORYU|4.0|when you are playing Spider! I am really enjoying this game, it is a great time filler. I recommend. it.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I had only heard one of The Band Perry's songs when I was introduced to them live at a performance at the Grand Ole Opry.  It took all of two words sung by Kimberly before I had goosebumps.  The incredible thing is that her voice is so much better live - such a rarity in today's highly edited albums.  This is no nasal-voiced singer with a good backup band.  This is a truly gifted singer with  excellent backup musicians and vocalists.  There are few who can harmonize as well as family members.  These three can blend their voices in wonderful ways.<br /><br />So the singing is top-notch, what about the lyrics.  I've got to say I was shocked at how well written these songs were.  I get so tired of songs that have no more depth than the wading pool.  These songs make me think, they make me strive to understand the singers point of view.  While some are just fun, others touch very deep emotions.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o new country style - no steel guitar<br />o excellent song-writing<br />o excellent instrumentalists<br />o top-notch vocals<br /><br />Cons:<br />o when will that next album be out???<br /><br />Overall - this is an excellent album, one of the few full albums I have bought in the last year.  Highly recommended.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been a King fan for forty years and have been disappointed in recent years by some of his less than enthralling works. \\"11/22/63\\" will stand up to King's best works including \\"The Stand\\" and \\"The Shining\\". Hopefully, he has finally turned the page since his horrid accident and has returned to the writing style that made him so great.

0061124265|5.0|This is seriously one of the best books I've ever read.  It is a completely unexpected gem as I just picked it on random.  I won't go into the plot summary or any of that, since it's already been done on here many times by other readers.<br /><br />What I will say is this is one of those books that pulls you in and keeps you there.  You begin thinking \\"this book is incredibly depressing\\" to feeling a sense of enlightenment and wonder as you see the story of death vs life unfold from the point of view of someone who has been on both sides.<br /><br />This is not a long book, only around 200 pages but when you finish it, you feel thankful to be alive and might even start looking at your own life from a different point of view.  What is so amazing is that usually, situations that make you take a hard look at yourself are ones of someone else's misfortune.  You feel thankful and remember again how good you actually have it.  This book isn't like that.  It made me see that value of really living from the point of view of someone who has woken from the most restful sleep.<br /><br />\\"Existence is a gift. Whether one thinks it is holy or not is entirely up to them, but life really is a blessing, a miracle, a cosmic phenomenon. Coelho points out in his novel that a change in perspective, no matter how slight or dramatic, can often tie a falling person tighter to the thread of life.\\"<br /><br />This is my first book from this author but certainly will not be my last.
B00470HPJI|5.0|What can I say? The album is stunning.
1449382673|4.0|(Full disclosure: This book was provided for review at no cost to me)<br /><br />What you need to know:<br /><br />* This book is geared towards a reader who has experience in at least one other programming language.<br />* I had a hard time getting through the book due to previous experience with Python, so I would really emphasize that this is a book for Python newbies only.<br />* This book is more for Python beginners, and not for those who want a Python equivalent of [[ASIN:0131103628 The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)]]; it is _not_ a reference book.<br />* This book covers Python 3.1.2, and briefly touches on Android 2.2 SDK Platform (API  and Python for Android (v2.6.2).<br /><br />Good Points:<br /><br />* It has a lot of call outs which add helpful notes to walk you through what the code is doing. The topic, \\"Comprehending Lists\\" (via Google Books), is a great example of this.<br />* The book uses a conversational approach to teaching, which newcomers should find less intimidating.<br />* Illustrations are everywhere.<br />* A common way of showing code is to first use a crude approach, then go back and show the right way, highlighting the mistakes made in the first attempt.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this book to someone that is interested in learning Python and wants a high-level overview of the language. You won't learn all that you need to know about Python from this book, but it is a good start.
B0058HDHIC|4.0|Ane Brun took a chance in this album. Its arrangements are very different to her previous ones, and I think that it is a good thing when artists decide to do something new without losing his/her identity.<br /><br />Strings, piano, guitar and percussion are there, but they are so subtle that, except for a couple of tracks, you can barely notice them. However, it's that subtlety what makes this albums stand out for they highlight Ane Brun's beautiful voice.<br /><br />All tracks are a delight. \\"These Days\\", \\"The Light From One\\" and \\"Worship\\" are the highlights. They got inside my head the minute that I first listened to them and never left. However, \\"One\\" and \\"Do You Remember?\\" tend to sound like Broadway pieces (these are the couple of tracks I mentioned above), which I find off tune with the mood set by the rest of the tracks.<br /><br />All in all, an original album that sounds like nothing I have listened to before done either by her or other artists.
0307454568|5.0|I waited a long time for the paperpack version.  Forget Kindle, I am keeping the trilogy in paper.  Great stories and characters.  The book, as ususal, is better than the movie - more defined.  Start at the beginning and buy all three. These are keepers!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I enjoyed \\"Sarah's Key\\" very much.  A sad story about our history that never should have happened. It was well written and I would recommend it.  I am now reading \\"A Secret Kept\\" by the same author and am also enjoying it.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|this is just a cash grub (through ad support). it's the exact same game, knock objects onto pigs by flinging birds. it's not even an original concept and the physics of the game are too wacky and inconsistent at times. there's absolutely no difference in gameplay between this and any other Angry Birds game. also, don't buy the games to skimpy on ads. just turn off your wi-fi (Kindle Fire here) and it plays without ads.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Excellent, Excellent movie.  I wish I had been on the Oscar academy when this movie could have been considered a candidate.  It would have definitely won my vote.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|British songstress Adele's impressive Grammys sweep of February 12, 2012 for her album \\"21\\" was extremely impressive and extremely deserved, without question.  But only three years before that, she won her first Grammys, including for Best New Artist, for her 2008 release \\"19.\\"<br /><br />In contrast to the latter album's larger-scale (though thankfully not overblown) arrangements, on \\"19\\", Adele largely concentrated on songs and arrangements rooted in jazz, blues, and acoustic singer/songwriter influences from the late 1960s and 1970s.  Many of the arrangements here are decidedly low key and sparse, notably on the opening track \\"Daydreamer\\", where Adele accompanies herself on acoustic guitar, \\"Best For Last\\", where she handles electric bass; and \\"First Love\\", where she plays celesta.  As is indicated on this album, and which was further validated by \\"21\\", Adele clearly had what it took to have staying power in a music business that has turned totally topsy-turvy in the 21st century.  Her musical approach put her into the same musical arena as Joss Stone and Amy Winehouse, of following in the footsteps of Britain's greatest female export to American during the rock era, Dusty Springfield, though such comparisons may seem a bit skewed to some.  With one notable exception, a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"To Make You Feel My Love\\", Adele either wrote or co-wrote the songs on \\"19\\"; and subsequently, it is a very intense and personal vision she shows us, instead of one dictated by hot-shot songwriting committees.<br /><br />Adele has become one of those artists who makes us all realize how few of the countless female singers that there are out there concentrate anymore on getting to the penetrating truths of life, love, and loss.  Too many of them, weaned on Mariah, Whitney, Celine, and all their subsequent pretenders on \\"American Idol\\", \\"X Factor\\", and \\"The Voice\\", mistake vocal acrobatics and holding single notes for ten seconds for true emotion or feeling, and it is somethingthat Adele has managed to avoid almost like the plague that it is.  \\"19\\" was the album that set it all in motion for her.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|this is one of those classic movies you have to see at least once. Whitney Houston paints a very complex character of someone who is brilliant, and strong in many ways but also very vulnerable and flawed at the same time.<br />Kevin Costner similarly creates a character that is much more complex, interesting and endearing than the initial impression gives.<br />Even the side characters like Tony the bodyguard come off as being very plausible, likable and multi-faceted.<br /><br />Fantastic, hard to describe experience.
0545265355|5.0|I bought the set as a gift to my boyfriend (and so I could read them as well). The stories themselves were brilliant, however I was lucky enough to receive a boxed set with massive ink splotches (Mockingjay, specifically) which rendered several pages unreadable. Hopefully I didn't miss too many plot points...<br />However, from the beginning of the Hunger Games to the end of Mockingjay I couldn't put the books down. My boyfriend is a slower reader than I am but he seems to be enjoying them just as much as me.

0307913147|5.0|I won't waste time telling you how good the \\"book\\" is, as others have done that very well (and the book definitely deserves a 5* rating). I just need to give kudos to Wil Wheaton. Wil does his usual audiobook effort here, which is to say that he _completely_ \\"owns\\" this. If you've never taken in one of his works (e.g. his reading of a Scalzi novel), then even if you've \\"read\\" the book already, do yourself a favor at some point, and \\"re-read\\" it again, by listening to Wil's rendition.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|the response time and refresh rate is amazing, its a literal mirror interface of your desktop.  I highly recommend this app, especially for IT people, hands down one of the best RDP solutions available.
B007JUWM64|2.0|poor script, dull characters, disconnected relationships, overall it was unbelievable. I mean that in the strictest sense. I didn't buy one relationship, one actor, one moment. I finished it because I paid money. It was dull and senseless in the truest form. Visuals were nice, but they too never really connected. The best parts were the maps. In short, this movie was a stew created by a first time cook. Nothing mixed well.

B003O86FMW|3.0|The book is at the top of the list of number of Amazon highlighted passages for all books. I have looked through the \\"highlighted\\" passages, and they are not so memorable that they would be highlighted as often as claimed. Her books have more highlights than longstanding works that have much more thought-provoking and memorable content. It is somehow a not accurate. Perhaps the book is on the reading list for a school district? In any case, the number of highlights cannot possibly indicate that the book is so quotable.<br /><br />That said, it is a good book, but I am still reading it.

B004EPZ0BQ|4.0|*Friends With Benefits Review*<br /><br />So we watched _Friends With Benefits_ last night. It's good date night material being primarily a romantic comedy. Of course you basically know what you're going to get with this sort of thing.<br /><br />And really there were no great surprises. Mainly the thin plot is carried by the charisma of the two leads, who did a good job I thought of making you want to like them.<br /><br />In the early stages it was a bit _edgier_ than the average romcom which was fun, but that did rather fizzle out later on. Leaving me to feel it could have been something more than it ended up being. The depictions of their frank sexual discussions early on about what they like or don't like probably rang more true than anything else in the movie.<br /><br />The dialogue was snappy too. More so than your average romcom and it makes a change from the endless parades of _dumb comedy_ movies. There were even some nice pop culture digs slipped in unobtrusively.<br /><br />But of course it ended up playing safe. They didn't stay as FWB. We knew they weren't going to. They felt something deeper. Etc. etc.<br /><br />That's fine. I enjoy sappy happy endings for this sort of movie anyway.  But it does leave me wondering where they could have gone with it if they didn't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

B001GMQALY|3.0|9 1/2 Weeks is one of my favorite movies and definitely worth five stars. However, I just watched the Amazon Instant video and it is a watered down version that cuts the pivotal scene where &lt;SPOILER> John (Rourke) tells Elizabeth (Bassinger) that they'll play a game where she needs to crawl on all fours and pick up the money he threw on the ground.  If you're a first time viewer of this movie the deletion of this scene might not bother you, but if you're a 9 1/2 Weeks enthusiast like I am, you may find it disappointing like I did.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good time waster but to many ads!!!!!!!!!!!!! fun games though . glitchy controls and it never.works when u try to get a game to get free points
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|quick read with great advice and information. i wasn't expecting a book about business to be so amusing and straightforward. i highly recommend this to anyone who owns a business or is thinking about starting one
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I was watching \\"Good Morning America\\" one day last week and Robin Roberts and the desk gang were litterally trying to grab the book out of each others hands!  I thought that \\"This has gotta be good.\\"  I immediately downloaded it into my iPhone.<br />  This horribly wounded man and this innocent young woman are compelling characters, but I admit I felt a little less of myself for reading it and being fascinated by it.  I litterally read it in less than a day.  Afterwards I felt emotionally drained and a little dirty and took a long hot bath.<br />  I came to Amazon and read the reviews of \\"Darker\\" and much to my shame and horror, downloaded it. I'm hoping for the best for these two characters...the damaged, scarred Christopher who has everything material and nothing that really counts in life, and the honorable young woman who loves him seemingly unconditionally but suffering such misgivings.<br />  This is the first review I've ever felt compelled to write...so there we two virgins here.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent series!! It draws you in and keeps your attention starting with book 1 and continuing through book 3.  A great trilogy. The purchase price at Amazon was very reasonable.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this for my stepson so he can use. It in gaming and he just loved it, he made me try it on once and I must admit its really awesome! The sound is just out of this world!
0756407125|4.0|I liked the book, compared to the first part in the trilogy I felt that the writing had improved. The storyline suffered less from predictability and the writing captured me and urged me to read on. Main weakness for me was the ending, the story just kind of fades out and thats that. It makes the whole book seem like an interlude.<br /><br />Some of the new characters were pretty interesting as well, I especially liked the Maer and the people at his court. In the Name of the Wind (first part in the trilogy) I felt that all characters were either clearly good or bad, characters in this book tend to be a bit more ambiguous which is a big improvement in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall a good book and it convinced me to continue reading the next part of this trilogy when it comes available.
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is my first William Landay book and I love it. The character development as well as the plot are both outstanding. Putting this in perspective, I am an avid reader of Grisham, DeMille, Lee Child, Michael Connelly, Meltzer and Silva among others.<br />The use of language by Landay reminds me of Turow and even Updike. But good language craft alone, without the character development and compelling plot is a bore.<br />Landay has it all. This particular book reminds me of Jody Picault's \\"19 Minutes\\" which was also a good read.<br />A teenager is found murdered outside of school grounds. The main character is a district attorney in this suburb and has a child of the same age in the same school. Great basis for a plot and expertly executed.<br />Read it. No reservations at all.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I sat down to watch this movie because I thought it was going to be a mindless yet entertaining action flick with Liam Neeson kicking ass as usual. It turned out to be very well directed with a simple yet deep plot. I'm not going to go on and on about it as I'm not wanna-be movie critic but I will just say that this is a great movie unlike all the other garbage in theaters today.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Must see.  I was crying this movie was so dang funny! I don't know what else to say except it made my day!
B003IWOVN4|5.0|Exellent music. It's a wonder that with french words, this come out absolutly fantastic,<br />it reminds me of Etta James, Ottis Redding,Robin Thicke and many others.<br />It'e one of my favorite album. i love the song \\" elle me dis \\".<br />I'll buy more from that group
B002BWP49M|5.0|Product as described,fast shipping! I was skeptical to order a product through Amazon,especially a blu ray or CD because sometimes the sound quality sucks. But as usual,I was not disappointed! Great quality!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Don't let the hypocritical advertizing campaign turn you off of this new Dr. Seuss adaptation. Although the film, inevitably includes a lot of padding to make a 72 page book into a 90 minute feature but the movie retains the message of the original book. The movie has some pretty catchy songs and their aren't too many slapstick jokes and attempts to be \\"hip\\".
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Martin continues the saga with more characters, more places, more deaths, more disappearances and more people seemingly resurrected from what appeared to be certain death.  We still don't know for sure where he intends to take us in the end, or who will be alive to welcome us there.  Very frustrating.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Real page turner ... enjoyed this book very much ... could not wait to pick it up again when I stopped reading.  I found it thoughtful ... how would it be if this happened to me?? How would my husband react and how long before frustration set in???<br /><br />I purchased this book after reading a few reviews on Amazon ... sounded like something I would be interested in reading -- and it was!!<br /><br />Bernice Weisgrau
B004R36QUE|5.0|The King's Speech is an all-time favorite for me and my wife. The acting, directing are superb. It was particularly meaningful to us, I think, because we can remember the King from our childhood. This is a wonderful story for the whole family--even though there are a few cuss words in one scene. it is real, it is human, it is heartrending and triumphant all at once.

1118109791|4.0|I have this recurring dream that - some day, GMAC will publish an Official Guide that will cater to the entire spectrum of students taking the GMAT (from those aiming a score in the low 500s to those aiming in the high 700s). Alas, if you aim to be in 96 percentile or above, then nothing has changed. I'd stick my head out and venture that the book's still not good enough to get you into the 700s. Unless you are one of those 'GMAT pingers' - keep taking (pinging) the GMAT every few months and hope that you miraculously cross that magic number. FWIW, my review of this book is strictly addressed to the crowd that aspires to get 700+.<br /><br />Problem Solving: The publishers have tried to up the game in this edition but it's still not good enough. Don't be thrown off by marketing terms like '20% new material', etc. Remember it's quality over quantity. Most of the problems are still very easy and straight forward. Don't expect to encounter the same level of questions in the exam (especially, if you are tracking higher).<br />For e.g; problem #s 28 and 61 are deceptively simple. You would be tracking a score in the 400s if you'd ever see one of these problems in the exam! Unless I somehow missed it, I didn't a single Permutation and Combination question in this section.<br /><br />Data Sufficiency: GMAC ups the game in this section and you can see discernibly harder problems. But the jury's still out whether the caliber of questions is good enough to prepare for the actual exam. Even the GMAT Prep software has much harder problems than these.<br /><br />Verbal: A lot of new passages in the Critical Reasoning section. I see a new emphasis on the question type - 'Which of the following...'. Sentence Correction remains the same, albeit with some newer questions. But the explanations still s()ck and everyone's invariably going to gravitate toward the MGMAT SC book. Dude, where are the subjunctives?<br /><br />Integrated Reasoning: This is the new section. The format of theexam changes this June. The book has an overview of the concept but there are no questions here. The back of the Guide has instructions on to access these questions from the GMAC website.<br /><br />On a silly note, I noticed that the publishers of this book switched the printing from black ink (OG 12th Ed.) to a darker shade of gray ink in this edition. Which genius at Wiley decided that this was a cool idea we will never know. Maybe, it's meant to deter piracy (scanner unfriendly), save cost on the ink, etc. The conspiracy theorist in me says that it was a deliberate move - probably, the ink starts fading faster, thereby, killing the re-sale value of the book. All in all, I'm not a big fan of this move.<br /><br />Verdict: Irrespective of what most reviewers say, everyone is going to purchase this book (and GMAC knows that). I only wish that the book had questions of the level that you'd typically encounter in the exam.
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|This is an excellent DVD for ANY Green Day fan, whether you like their old or new stuff, because they play both! They even cover My Generation...and boy they did a good job. The only downside is that it's not as good as Bullet in a Bible, mainly because there are none of those inbetween song things. I recommend this to anyone who's on the fence!

B005DWA5KK|2.0|Two star rating indicates I didn't, particularly, enjoy film, which isn't entirely true --it was hysterical!  (still laughing) Dark eyeliner rules.  Acting was mediocre at best (intense)..... Fun, Creepy movie to immerse yourself in -- on a late weekend night.  Psychological thriller, macabre, nightmarish.  Did \\"not\\" view the original version.
B005D51JQQ|4.0|I agree that this set is overpriced but I don't share the notion of my fellow reviewers that this set is completely useless.  It is actually a decent box set with great packaging, great song choices & it is the first time that most of Sting's solo hits have been re-mastered.  And as someone who is quite picky about sound quality, I can confirm that the re-mastering on theses discs is exceptional.<br /><br />My only complaints are the high price & the abscence of rarities, b-sides, etc.. I'm sure that is in the works but it would've been nice to have it now.<br /><br />But if you got some spare cash & want a sonic upgrade, a nice booklet, a few cool live tracks & a decent concert dvd to boot, this is still a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />It's worth noting that \\"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\\" is a slightly alternate version.  Has extra b/g vocals & sounds like it was recorded in a smaller room with different acoustics. Still sounds great though.
B0078N2MTE|5.0|Really worth watching very good movie right to the end.It will leave you wanting more or wishing for more. The main actor very good in this role.

ATRIP, by the way, stands for \\"The International Association for the Advancement for Teaching and Research in Intellectual Property\\"!<br /><br />The book therefore assembles the work of... prominent academics from most countries around the globe, from China and the US to many European countries, all of whom were assembled at the 2010 ATRIP congress held in Stockholm.  In keeping with the intention of the series, the book aims to represent a full and dynamic picture of contemporary high-level IP research in an international setting.<br /><br />The fundamental aim of the congress - very reassuring to creative types we know --  was `to embrace fundamental , eternal and yet very contemporary elements in IP law', with the emphasis on classic IP Law values aimed at protecting individual human creativity based on an attitude of respect for original ownership.<br /><br />A mere glance at the table of contents reveals some intriguing subject matter intensively examined and clearly presented.  Parts I and II deal respectively, with IP rights and competition law and individualism and collectiveness in patent law and in copyright law.<br /><br />Individual chapters here include the necessity to collectivize copyright and the dangers (sounds frightening) and two perspectives on the Google book settlement.  There's a chapter offering the Chinese viewpoint on multinationals' global governance on the Internet and another on `virtual teachers: a copyright paradox.'  These few examples should give you a flavour of the scope and interest of the book as well as the breadth and depth of subject matter.<br /><br />For those involved in the field of intellectual property this book provides much information and food for thought based on what we would conclude is much original, thorough and extensive research by a very select and talented grouping of specialists in this field.  If you are a specialist IP lawyer, the book is certainly interesting reading and, we would have thought, an essential purchase for your library.ok as well as the breadth and depth of subject matter.<br /><br />For those involved in the field of intellectual property this book provides much information and food for thought based on what we would conclude is much original, thorough and extensive research by a very select and talented grouping of specialists in this field.

But not that any of us, even lawyers, give all that much thought to the complex regulatory landscape which underpins the production, marketing and distribution of food worldwide, not to mention a host of related issues which ultimately affect all of us - hence the fascination of this compendium of learned essays on the subject contained in this latest book from Edward Elgar.<br /><br />Part of Elgar's `Research Handbooks on the WTO' series, this is a collection of learned articles and essays from a multi-disciplinary team of fourteen practitioners and academics worldwide on the WTO (World Trade Organisation) Agriculture Agreement.<br /><br />The book focuses on `new' issues linked to the international regulation of agricultural production and trade, many of which, according to the editors, have either been insufficiently covered by the rules of the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), or not quite adequately covered by existing literature. These are pressing problems nonetheless, as they pertain directly to international agricultural trade law, policy and regulation centering on matters of national food security, global climate change and biotechnology.<br /><br />Many practitioners may not realize this (although many might well do) but, as the editors point out, the AoA effectively ended the era in which Agriculture was excluded from key principles of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  The editors nevertheless, are of the view that `members of the WTO are still not yet ready to treat agriculture in the same way as other products', even though they concede that the AoA's short term objective is to initiate a process of reform of trade in agriculture, while its long term aim is `to establish a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system.'<br /><br />The range of topics covered in this volume is multi-faceted and various.  Some of the papers deal with issues that are positively alarming; `Do WTO rules improve or impair the right to food?' asks the paper from Christian Haberli at the World Trade Institute at Bern.  Another paper by Michael Cardwell sheds interesting new light on the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.  The essay by Graham Dutfield includes examinations of, for example, plant intellectual property and food security, focusing on the institutional and legal considerations and the need for reform.<br /><br />These are only a few examples of course, of the wealth of research on agricultural trade law issues contained in this book.  Practitioners with clients involved in agri-business will be particularly interested in the broad spectrum of matters discussed, as will trade negotiators, policy advisers and graduate students in this vital and fascinating field.

Just how they choose to collect it, impose it and then spend it, is essentially a political decision which of course impacts on the distribution of income within a country and certainly on poverty levels.<br />`One of the most fundamental policy decisions to be made in the design of tax systems,' the editors remark, `is that of (the) direct-indirect tax mix, or how much to rely on direct taxes, such as personal and corporate taxes, versus indirect taxes such as VAT and excises.'<br /><br />This and a wealth of other fascinating issues regarding tax worldwide are discussed, examined and analysed in depth in this thought provoking book, which is a compilation of papers from no less than sixteen learned contributors -- including two of the editors - all from well known universities worldwide and all specialists in public finance. Each paper was presented and discussed at the `Tax Systems: Whence and Whither' conference organized by prominent Spanish financial institutions and held in Malaga in 2009.<br /><br />With its conspicuously international perspective, the book offers insights into a variety of taxation systems and theories, from tax systems in the OECD to `Political Regimes, Institutions and the Nature of Tax Systems' to `Tax System Change and the Impact of Tax Research.'<br /><br />There is of course, much more to savour and inwardly digest in this useful volume, including the current trends and types of taxation from personal and corporate income tax to issues relating to direct versus indirect taxation.<br /><br />Each of the papers is structured in much the same way, with an introduction, conclusion and typically a lengthy bibliography at the end for further reading and research. And there is a detailed index at the back, plus a really useful list of abbreviations to facilitate ease of use. As taxation policy can be crucial to political survival in so many instances, this book of collective wisdom, we've no doubt, will soon become a valued addition to the well stocked tax specialist's library.rends and types of taxation from personal and corporate income tax to issues relating to direct versus indirect taxation.<br /><br />Each of the papers is structured in much the same way, with an introduction, conclusion and typically a lengthy bibliography at the end for further reading and research.

0857931067|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2SNVM73NX5XBZ]]<br />READ THIS HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND SPECIALISED TEXT<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you or any of your clients do business in China, some familiarity with Chinese law would be a distinct advantage.  Trouble is, the book market to date hasn't exactly been inundated with a deluge of books on Chinese commercial law in English.  Fortunately, Elgar Publishing has sought to address this problem with several excellent books, one of which we review here, namely: `Copyright and the Public Interest in China' by Guan H. Tang.<br /><br />As part of the Elgar Intellectual Property and Global Development' series, Ms. Tang's book, discusses a range of IP -- specifically copyright -- topics, with the emphasis on the public interest, as the title indicates, notably with respect to the opening up of public archives in China, and other issues such as access to government information and state claims of copyright.<br /><br />Of particular interest to us in the West is Tang's comparison of UK and US copyright practices with those in China, thus demonstrating the distinction between the Chinese and Western approaches.<br /><br />As mentioned in the acknowledgements, the book started life as a PhD thesis, which, as all such theses should do, explores new avenues of enquiry into this complex and now very topical field.  And it's supported by a number of venerable international institutions, including Shanghai University of Finance and Research and the University of Edinburgh, to name only two.<br /><br />The resulting research offers the attributes both of clarity and scholarship.  A `brilliant amalgam of law, history, social analysis and some Confucian philosophy,' says Edinburgh University's Hector MacQueen, who adds that the book is a fascinating analysis of Chinese attitudes to a number of relevant issues, from education and censorship to the influence of the Internet.<br /><br />It is indeed interesting that the term \\"law\\" in Chinese consists of two words, `fa' \\"method\\" and `lu', \\"standard\\". Modern copyright law in China, however, as we know it, is apparently derived from -- and based on -- the copyright models evolved from the UK and later the USA which derived its federal copyright law from the British model.  It was not until 1990, however, that modern copyright law came into force in the People's Republic of China.  It has developed rapidly since then, `primarily based on the Western model,' affirms Tang and regulated by international standards.<br /><br />The book is meticulously footnoted, with the research tools one would expect from a work of this stature, including an interesting introduction, detailed index and table of contents, plus tables of relevant cases and legislation.<br /><br />Equally interesting is an appendix featuring a timeline of Chinese history. Anyone seeking special insights into the many factors behind China's fourth place ranking as an economic superpower, will find much to assimilate and discuss in this very thorough and eminently readable work of scholarship.It is indeed interesting that the term \\"law\\" in Chinese consists of two words, `fa' \\"method\\" and `lu', \\"standard\\".

B0073LWEXK|5.0|As I am new to Kindle Fire, this is my first try at a hidden object game on it. I love hidden object games, but my only experience  up to now has been on my computer. Having experience with Big Fish games like Ravenhearst ,Mystery Case Files,  etc, I am used to many aspects of this game.  Those not used to the multiple scenes or having to retrace your steps to recover items or to use those items from scenes previously visited, would become frustrated. In this game some items are not obtainable unless you are in the correct season, so you must travel the scenes to &quot;change&quot; the seasons.  The hints and spoilers are helpful without spoiling your fun, but unlike Big Fish games there is no way to skip the mini puzzles in the game if you can't solve them. Finished the game late last night and feel that it was well worth the $1.99 price.
1932735410|5.0|When I heard about Rita Mcauley's PMP Exam Prep, I had already signed up for a PMP Exam Prep Boot Camp offered by another vendor.  After the boot camp, I realized that I needed to take a deeper dive into interpreting and understanding the PMBOK.  I have some experience managing projects but as fellow PM's know, real world is different than how you are tested on the PMI-PMP exam.  We formed a study group and it was recommended that we use Rita's PMP Exam Prep.  Now I know why!!!!  The information is presented from a \\"non-PMI\\" project management point of view.  During the past 3-4 weeks, I put the boot camp material aside and read the PMBOK and the Rita's PMP Exam Prep cover to cover!  I PASSED THE EXAM TODAY!  Just in case you think that this might be a paid endorsement, it's not.  THIS IS FOR REAL!!!!!  You have to study the material more than once and you have to be prepared to sacrifice a lot of time but it was worth it in the end!  Thanks to the contributors who continue the legacy that Rita left behind!

B00004W4UB|4.0|I recall this movie being advertised many years back and it was a different world back then. There were fewer channels so ads on the main networks were very expensive, and that meant this young actress had made it with the executive brass,as this type of advertising was expensive. At the time I was in a series of small towns,and wasnt able to see this film. I remember this actress from movies only,although in later years saw her appear in shows i watched like law and order(where she had a relationship with a star) and friends(maybe and marlo thomas well...maybe her too i forget). Anyways at this time she struck it big, and this theme of this movie,having dealt with woman issues for many years I found interesting. The movie with the Dickens fog and all,<br />is really about the abuse suffered by this chambermaid relayed to us through dreams and nightmares,as traumas revisited,and the males who think they have sexual desires but really have dreams of torture and confinement,the character<br />also has thoughts of confinement. It is a psychological thriller of sorts...although it does entertain. The character given her traumas is<br />incapable of forming relationships,and in that sense the film is well done<br />and true to life as things develop the way we think a character like her should develop. What I find interesting about this tale of victorian times,is the disordered world in which all the key characters inhabit,the doctor mr hyde and the traumatized patient...living the nightmares. Although it seems an odd choice to put this star in asa vehicle,Pretty Woman would make her a fixture for many years and to this day throughout the world. Her best role and film is probably My best friends wedding, and many of her films can actually be shown to younger pre teen girls and they would enjoy them...why quantify films as per age level such scientific standards are meaningless. This film is not appropriate for younger viewers,but certainly some of her other more cinderella/fairytale type roles certainly are. I put off watching this film for many years finding it odd in her career,but now find it interesting and its subject matter I finally comprehend more at an older age..
B005723JSQ|4.0|This book was a lot of fun to read. I wanted to read it all day long if I could have. Sophie makes me laugh and helps me relax. I would recommend any of her books and will continue to read anything she comes out with.
B003ASLJMW|4.0|Given the ways this actor is often typified,and as he reminds us in the bonus feature as a type he is always trying to break and encompass some variety in his work, the same basic character is always at the heart of his roles. He is an old warner brothers stalwart,a company whoose heritage goes back to the beginnings of sound productions in hollywood,and that type of gritty character<br />we see in all his films in which a part of americana shines through,is reminiscent to the old stars of hollywod. The tough resilient actors who during the war years,and a few years afterwards, made their war films which were not always their best work,but are interesting facets of their overall career. The bonus features also show Eastwood in washington,and many of the military and governing class around Reagan,welcome him but likely Reagan himself is orchestrating these previews, of an actor making movies and roles in a high profile way of things occurring and values expressed in america. Of the actors in america,the modern actors,he is my perennial favorite for many years, although every which way but loose/any which way you can does not seem the best use of his talents,and he takes up this criticism in the bonus features, they were very popular and made him many fans. Whoose to argue with success! As warner now releases 35 of his films on dvd,I an old fan of his from his beginnings and has watched and enjoyed his success,and his creative work, will<br />rewatch and blog as to what i see in each film. I look forward to it,as I once enjoyed his films as they first came out. Of course when they put out such a large compilation of discs on one set,the actor more or less says here is my work,I probably will not do much more,what i've done is behind and that's what i've been, a fixture in hollywood and washington. Reagan sees in eastwood something he was not able to achieve himself,someone bringing the values of all those small towns and large city values to the screen in a popular way,he was always relegated to b films,making petitions to be in better films. Eastwood whoose films really have american topics and values at their heart,since he himself is front and center and in other ways, so its good to have someone doing something different in hollywood...even though his european friends keep bringing up his spaghetti westerns which they and we all miss...<br /><br />This film has a literary source and it shows. It confronts the viewer and this is a different film being a spy caper than most of Eastwood's fare. It's the cold war. The opening prologue to the film in which Eastwood is imprisoned as a military person,caged in wood, and watched derisively by asian children and the character's mental disorder...it's in the background and stays there...and he is asked to rejoin the war effort,from vietnam,and the novel's source is britain,so we have britain and the u.s. in Russia,with a subplot about jews in<br />the Soviet Union, and the Eastwood character must steal a jet,built by jewish brains in the soviet union,and the british are involved here,and it's an interesting part of the film the Eastwood character,doesnt understand how they accept the jewish people,or others,having to die and accept what these foreign spies want? He is not really a spy,but an old american soldier of fortune doing what's good for his country,and making some money, which was not always understood in europe..and there are subplots about drugs,being brought into the soviet union,by foreign powers. An interesting look at the cold war,and the politics of what became the soviet union never recovered from the assassination of Rasputin which still haunts the world today,but a film such as this in which much plotting is reduced to 2 hours,so much remains unsaid. All characters are international or represent a nation,the individual is lost...an interesting film and a change of pace for Eastwood...enjoyable but not one of his classics a film previewed in hollywood,which i recalledseeing on tv at the time with much fanfare,the mayor of carmel who caused a sensation there(i still recall all these articles and footage)the man who became as an a actor what Reagan was never able to become,a fixture in hollywood which je remains..and i look forward to going over all these films again. A joy!!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This was a terrific movie, well worth watching, in spite of all of the pundits trying to kill it off.<br /><br />Lynn Collins was just luminescent as Dejah Thoris.  The subtle tattoos and jewelry and costuming, combined with her native intelligence and athletic grace and power made for a beautiful modern version of the Princess of Mars. Her irises were enhanced (probably digitally) to a shimmering blue, which was a really nice effect (I think her eyes are normally gray or hazel green, from other photos).  The Edgar Rice Burroughs (ERB) version of Dejah Thoris would have been boring to watch, much like Kim Basinger doing nothing but scream and get tossed around like a sack of potatoes, playing a Victorian era Damsel in Distress in the first Batman movie.<br /><br />Much of the story may seem derivative unless you consider that ERB created them first 100 years ago, and his ideas have been liberally borrowed by many subsequent generations of science fiction writers and movie makers.  It has since become a canon of science fiction that Mars was once inhabited by a lost civilization that faded away as its water and atmosphere faded away.  \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Avatar\\" are among many movies that have taken large chunks of the original ideas of ERB's Barsoom series - the swashbuckling battles between airships, the Arena Battle with monsters, the existence of a powerful force in this strange new world, and the multiple races/species of intelligent creatures coexisting and fighting against each other.<br /><br />The storyline of the movie is actually a combination of ERB's \\"A Princess of Mars\\" and the second book in the Barsoom series \\"The Gods of Mars\\".  The trip to the Valley Dor and the mysterious Therns do not appear until the second book.<br /><br />Disney appears to have done everything wrong to market this movie, and the amount of vitriole directed against the movie, probably planted by Disney insiders, has been totally disproportional to the actual quality of the movie.  It's almost as if Disney is fighting an internal battle to not make any more of this series of movies (three were planned).  Which would be a complete shame because I really like this movie.<br /><br />Could the movie have been better?  Well they could have picked a bigger male star with more charisma than Taylor Kitsch, who was OK in this role, but not overwhelming and was outshined by the glittering Lynn Collins.  It would have been interesting to see one of the shiny uber-handsome and very large Hemsworth brothers, Chris or Liam, in this role, or even Sam Worthington.  Dejah's father Tardos Mors and Kantos Kan were played by none other than Caesar and Mark Antony (from the HBO series \\"Rome\\") - Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy - which I thought was an odd paring, a bit too easily recognizable for people who watch a lot of movies.<br /><br />But otherwise, it's a great movie, and I hope people go and support it while it is still in the theaters, and I for one am planning to get the DVD/BluRay when it comes out.  Let's hope against hope for a continuation of this series.It's almost as if Disney is fighting an internal battle to not make any more of this series of movies (three were planned).

B000TGJ8AS|3.0|Got this yesterday and was excited to see that around six of the episodes had commentaries. Then imagine my surprise when none of the episodes have a commentary. I can understand the studio wanting to go the cheap route but why advertise something on the package it doesn't have?
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I tried the free version, but it didn't work.  I tapped on items, but nothing happened.  Not even the help or menu buttons responded.<br /><br />When the paid version was on sale I tried that, thinking it would work.  I was wrong.  I got the same result.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money.
B0078N2MTE|1.0|Don't waste your time or money on this pointless and anticlimactic excuse for a movie.  I usually hope to be, at the very least, slightly entertained from a 3 1/2 star movie.  Unfortunately, you can literally fast forward this movie every 15 minutes, watch it for 2 minutes, and not miss anything.  It's pointless, boring, and anything but,entertaining.  Lots of better movies out there......
044024367X|3.0|Since I read my first Reacher tale about a year ago I must have been through eight or nine of them. They are certainly a little formulaic in that Jack is drifting around the countryside and chances across some bad guys, and sorts it using his unique blend of analytical reasoning and brute force.  Add in a bit of romantic interest and that's about it really. However, they are well written and I would judge them all as good to outstanding reads.<br /><br />Nothing to Lose had the same elements as the others but for some reason it did not work nearly as well. Exactly why is quite hard to work out.  It is quite long by Lee Child standards and unusually the narrative seems to drag a bit, although it does pick up towards the climax. It is rather unclear until the end exactly what misdeeds are being perpetrated and the whole story revolves around Jack travelling between the twin towns of Hope and Despair.<br /><br />Every author is entitled to write a book once in a while which is not up to the usual standard.  This is by no means a stinker, but it is not the page turner we have come to expect from this author.  If this was the first Reacher book I had read, I would probably not have gone on to read the others which would have been my loss.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great entertainment for the family. I would recommend this app for anyone. It seems to be a little slow on my phone but works great on the kindle fire.
067960085X|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's. I'd seen the movie. I've read two other Capote books and was wowed by them. Breakfast at Tiffany's is equally wonderful. The juxtaposition of our narrator and Holly Golightly makes the book. Holly would probably be called manic-depressive today when she was hospitalized but to the narrator and her other admirers she has that rare zest for life that is to wonderous to behold. Others, more thoughtful observers, would also see in Holly the devastation she left in her wake.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I actually didn't mind the story line so much, there are all kinds of dysfunctional relationships to be had in the world and this one really wasn't all that shocking. Most of the time I could feel the emotion between the the two characaters and understood how there could be a \\"can't live with, can't live without,\\" pull.<br /><br />But there were problems with this book and for me they were epic. In fact there were so many I will only go into the ones that bothered me the most:<br /><br />I found that a lot of my dislike had to do with Ana herself. She was far more irritating than Christain, and part of it I think had to do with her thought process, and, for a college graduate, her immaturity (not to be confusd with inexperience). The constant \\"holy craps\\" were grating and began to remind me of an Everybody Loves Raymond episode, which is really a shame 'cause I actually liked that show and now the two will forever be intertwined in my brain. And don't even get me started on the \\"Inner Goddess\\" theme, way way overdone. And of course-as other reviewers have pointed out-there was the near constant irritaion of an American girl using British termonolgy.  If that was going to be a problem for the author why not just set the story in London? The Write What You Know rule may have worked better for Ms. James here.  I know I would never try to write a story set in Britain, some writers can pull it off, some just can't.<br /><br />These may seem like small issues, but if the writing style sticks out like a sore thumb and annoys me, I just can't enjoy the book.  I'm not saying it should be perfect, but the writing should at the very least be unobstrusive. After all, in the end, shouldn't it be more about the story and less about the mechanics of the writng?<br /><br />If you want to read some really good emotionally charged BDSM romance I highly recommend anything by ANNABEL JOSEPH over this novel.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|I gave this cd to my daughter for her birthday and she loves it and would recommend it to anyone who loves lady gaga!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The plot is plausible once you accept the time travel premise, although the paradoxes involved might have been better explored.  Characters are developed with gritty realism.  Exciting narrative.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|like this product alot. I would recoment it to anyone who is into Twilight saga! Even if your not I think you would like the music that is on it anyway!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|While this doesn't have all of the content found on other platforms, it is a lot of fun. The only problem, which is a pretty big one, is that I have twice had my saved game erased. One day, I'm playing through the game for the second time, and the next I had to start over. I finally got so frustrated that I uninstalled it.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Breaking Dawn part one dvd is so awsome! It is a must see movie, even if you are not a twilight fan. I makes you want to see part two now and you can't wait for the next dvd to come out.
B00003CXCT|5.0|In great condition too, love it! Would order from  the same  place again.  I was hesitant to order 'used' DVDs but this turned out to be a nice set, no scratches.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is convenient &amp; easy yo use. i have not had it very long but so far it seems like a good app. offers some nice options too. i would recomend this to friends.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Omigosh this app is amazing on the kindle fire!!! I love one direction and i got a bunch of their music!! This app is awesome and i wish i would have downloaded it sooner!!!:)
B007704HO6|5.0|This is the best read I have had in a long time.  First heard about it on TV, where they interviewed the author.  It is based on a true story and I would love to see it as a movie.  I had a ginger tom who died at the age of 13.  He was so sweet a companion but he never did the amazing stuff this cat did.  It is as though this cat was sent by God or an angel, to help this man find a sense of guidance and purpose, thus changing his life.  It reveals so much about others and how they perceive the homeless and down-on-their-luck.  It does much to reinforce my belief that animals are put here to make us better people, so we should be their guardians and protectors in return.  Awesome book.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I just recently became aware of this beautiful and talented woman.  Her voice, style and sense of humor combine for a delightful viewing and listening experience.  She is a great entertainer, and I can't wait to see more of her.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think its really fun and you should try it. fun to get pass levels to get new ones! games usually updated
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I enjoy using you version. it has several versions to allow.for comparison and interpretation of the word. if you need an electronic Bible,this is it.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love public radio stations and listen to them often using TuneIn Radio.  I have this program on my home computer, my iPad, and now my Android phone.  I use my Bluetooth earpiece to hear my favorite public radio programs.  I had no problem loading it onto my Samsung phone and it works without a flaw.  I find that I use it much more often that I thought that I would.  When I find myself waiting for a bus, a plane, a doctor, anything or anyone - I turn on the TuneIn Radio and listen to a great NPR or BBC or CBC program and am transported to another part of the world.  This is a great program and the only internet radio guide that I need.
0385484518|5.0|I don't know what it was about this little book, but I was crying the entire way through reading it (which I did in just one evening). If you read with an open mind and heart, the lessons in this book will touch you and really make you take a good look at your own life. I cannot remember ever reading a book that drew my emotions so forcefully.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|All I can say is GREAT! Fabulous music. Highly recommend.  Sorry she is going into retirement for a while.
B006W0QOF2|3.0|Thought perhaps a \\"take\\" on the \\"The Transporter\\" but more like \\"No Country for Old Men\\", sort of. Took forever for plot to be set: slow and main character not very talkative or not talkative at all. Action movie? Mostly \\"no\\". Drama? Some, no. Bloody? At times extremely so. F..k word? Used a lot at times. Liked it? Yes and no. Recommend? No.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|the user experience is better than VNC client<br />the support for using gmail account is brilliant and easy for user as we don't need to configure complex port forward.<br />however there are still some cons need to be updated<br />1. proxy support: when i was behind a ISA fire wall the gmail account feature is not enabled as i cannot input proxy account to authenticate<br />2. encryption is not supported
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this game i play it like every day. i love that my pic can be on the cards and on the back ground. if u love solitaire u should get this don't even think about not getting this game.
B000FC1GJW|3.0|I read all the three books and they were amazing, all about a prophecy, a temptation (which was the story line for the whole series). I get to the end of this book and there is NO temptation at ALL!! Lyra (the hero) and Will (her friend) get whisked to safety, out of battle (they're the heros/main characters they should fight!). and almost when the book/battle is over Lyra and Will find themselves in love for no good reason, just to have to part from each other forever. So, then they make a big deal out of leaving each other (if they didn't find themselves in love it wouldn't matter!!!)<br />Anyway, that's what I think.<br />and, if you spent your time reading this, Thank You.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|I did not know or hear about this film until the very week that it hit theatres(FOX ran tv spots for it about every 15 minutes),but I did not go to see it until 2 weeks later.Nevertheless,I was surprised to see a film that offers action and philosophy in equal servings and still manages to make you think.For that,I credit writer-director Andrew Niccol.The movie only cost $40 Million, but Niccol gives us a look at a future that looks real and where every second and minute counts.As for the leads,Niccol was wise to have a big name in the film,and Justin Timberlake handles the material well.He proves that he can not only carry a film, but an action film at that. And Amanda Seyfried oozes sexiness in every scene she's in.The rest of the cast is on point,particularly Alex Pettyfer(I Am Number Four) as british thug Fortis and Cillian Murphy (fresh from \\"Inception\\")as a relentless time-tracker.Like \\"Inception\\",this film had much thought put into it,but I like a film that can pull off such feats and not cost nowhere near as much(\\"Inception\\" cost $160 Million).All in all,this film exceeded my expectations greatly.
B001E45XT4|4.0|My last headphones, JVC HA-RX700's, were godly in terms of sound quality and how comfortable they were, but alas they were not long for this world.<br />After a brief funeral ceremony in the backyard I began my search for new headphones, and considering I've never had a decent pair of headphones last more than a couple of years(I have crappy ones from ten years ago that still somehow work fine) I decided to go more on the lower end of the headphone quality spectrum.<br />After reading a good number of reviews I was a bit wary about the quality and design of these headphones, but the price was right and just from looking at the picture they look like they're designed fairly well. To my surprise not only do these headphones not hurt my head, but I can wear them for hours at a time no problem, unlike my JVC headphones which would eventually get to hot and make my ears hurt. In regards to how comfortable these headphones are they actually beat my old headphones. Sound is another story; the bass is severely lacking and the sound just isn't as crisp with a bit of static if the volume is up. My old headphones didn't have a microphone, instead I used a Samson condenser mic, which isn't a fair comparison to a pair of $30 headphones with a mic, obviously the condenser mic is better.<br />I can say that compared to the quality of other headsets I've had that did have mics this one doesn't quite seem like the quality is as good, but it's not too bad really.<br />The headphone cups are quite bulky giving a nice amount of room, meaning pressure is distributed nicely over my ears which is good for long use, but at the same time the material is lightweight so they don't fatigue your neck after long use. Which is one of my biggest worries/complains, the plastic feels extremely cheap and I don't know that this headset will last. The headset is very bulky, but the plastic seems to be hollow with very thin walls.<br />The cord on the headset looks as though it will get nasty kinks or indentions in it if wrapped up, and the two 3.5mm connectors for the sound and mic are very thin at the end, to the point where I can see easily breaking them if I yanked them out to hard. On the cord about a foot down from the headset is a somewhat useful volume dial, a shirt clip I will never use, and a mic toggle I will never use.<br />Overall I'm very happy with these headphones for the price, but only time will tell if I'll stay that way.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't know what more I can add to the over 200 5-star reviews already written here. The book fully deserves the praise, not because it's \\"pretty good for a cheap Kindle book\\" but because it can stand alongside other major science fiction books, as others have noted. I'd give an extra half-star for the flawless editing and proofreading if I could.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ok I admit I bought into the hype and purchased this book. Now I wish I had both my time and money back! This is nothing more than a dull story with BDSM added to it to spice it up. I have read this subject matter before and with much better story lines than this. It is nothing new unless you have never read the subject content before, then I guess it probably did blow your mind. That said, if you want real BDSM with amazing plots I recommend Maya Banks, Jaid Black or Kaitlyn O'Conner. Each of these authors write amazing BDSM books and you don't feel like strangling the characters. I didn't want to believe that this somehow started out as a fan fic for Twilight, but having read it, YEP I can see it. Sadly the hero is flat and unappealing (unless of course this is your first BDSM novel, then he is probably appealing to you) and the heroine is so unbelievable and immature I wanted to smack her. I have to give the author credit, they have managed to take a mundane book and turn it into a gold mine.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Well thought out creative levels, good smooth physics, simple but requires thinking. Primitive graphics work surprisingly well. Gradual yet steady increase in difficulty. Kudos to the dev Kevin Bradford on a great Android game.
B004LUS390|3.0|As an artist, I thoroughly enjoy this program. I can't afford an iPad so I've settled with a Kindle and have found this to be possibly the most well-rounded art app on the Amazon market. I even look forward to using a stylus with it in the future. HOWEVER. I'm having a similar issue to another commenter on here; SBM crashes when I try to open a previously saved file. Not sure if it does it on one-layer pictures or not, but I'm severely disappointed in the fact I can no longer access/export to another format the paintings I have saved because they cannot be opened. If/when this is fixed, I will be more than happy to give this app a 5-star review.<br /><br /> ~Lizcakes
B0068PHS5Q|4.0|...and there really weren't any obligations (no particularly imminent ones at least), so there was no need to put this book down once I had started for the third and last time. I was lucky, because once I made it past the first two chapters, I did not WANT to put it down. I basically lived in it for the past 24 hours, so I am also still hoping that Aurelius did receive the right ashes. The book truly is spell-binding, a perfect read for a gloomy Beijing weekend - if you have a fireplace, a cup of English tea and a cat at your side to enjoy it by, I would highly recommend adding these props.<br /><br />I was surprised at those reviewers lamenting \\"too many words for the reduced price\\" that they paid - I wouldn't judge a book, or any novel for that matter, by its economy. Yes, it does have its obvious faults alongside obvious brilliance, but they do not lie in the word count, and most of us have yet to read the perfectly woven story. I, too, was terribly disappointed with the final inclusion of the Thirteenth Tale and would have rather seen it not be exposed at all; it would not have hurt the story in a any way to let it go along with Ms. Winter, to leave the Thirteen Tale open to being Vida Winter's or even Margaret Lea's story. I thought it was wonderful how people kept inquiring about the Thirteenth Tale; why shouldn't we, too?<br /><br />Already, enough engrossing mysteries have been solved by the end, and that detail did feel rather forced along with the general conclusion. However, it IS a happy ending (although I did not wish the poor dislocated Shadow any homesickness), and the book leaves you with the right balance of answers and, if you like, lingering patches of fog to ponder. I highly recommend this suspenseful \\"ghost\\" story.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app is really nice because if u need to be reminded about something u can write it down on a note pad so that your reminded about it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is game is really fun and you build and expand the city very easily. Only problem is once you progress through the game it can harder to to expand because you need investment points which can cost money but if you if post your achievements on facebook it can be easier to earn them buy items like expansions.
B005MYEPXC|1.0|No voice sound track...defective. Second one ordered. Had to send first one back..does not play voice sound...only the background music...very frustrating.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I saw the movie and loved it so I gave the game a try. I love it! never going to uninstall
0439023513|1.0|Well.. Disappointed. The book was rushed, ending was rushed. There was no real reason behind any of the events in the second half of the book. It has lost its originality and emotion. Suzanne collins rushed the conclusion of the book and we don't even get to really find out what happened to other characters or why. I don't mind who ended up with who at the end but it was the way it was written. As someone said.. we were just told but not shown. No emotion, no feeling, Just empty. Is that  what katniss is meant to be feeling like?<br /><br />Well it just sucks, I wish I had never continued to read your trilogy suzanne collins. I spent money on your books and you've just made it all a waste of time with your lack of emotion, lack of real story and a rushed ending. Poor. a BIG FAT F!

B0055SWM08|5.0|I love it! Quell was so highly rated that I took a chance on it. I'm not much of a gamer, but sincerely love this one. The first time I picked it up I played it for a couple of hours. It is totally addicting. I will definitely purchase the other version as well and will take a look at anything Fallen Tree creates.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So this is my first review! First off - i read all 3 books in about as many days. I actually stayed up until 5am 2 nights in a row to finish the last two books. There are so many things that i loved about this story, and many things i disliked.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The actual love story and getting to see how Christian and Ana fell in love despite the differences. This is why i gave it 4 stars<br />- SPOILER- the plot twist - i didn't make the connection until i read the last book that all of his subs were mirror images of his birth mom - that was a shocker!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- i loved the first and 2nd book. By the time i reached the 3rd book, the sex scenes got so repetitive i found myself skipping a lot of it. Not only that, i found myself growing tired of Ana always provoking Christian and then wondering why his mood sours! Why does she keep poking and poking about his mom and Elena and various things she knows Christians hates yet she's surprised when his mood turns sour??? I find myself championing for Christian more than anything and getting more and more annoyed with Ana as she keeps trying to \\"assert her independence\\" but only end up looking immature.<br /><br />Overall - i loved the love story and i liked Christians character. I wish the author spent more time with Kate and Elliot and wrapped up what happened with Ethan and Mia. I was also getting tired of the emails, although cute - texting would have been easier? I also got annoyed with a lot of the repetitive words like MERCURIAL and some others i've forgotten. and BABY - does Christian not know any other terms of endearment?

B0055SWM08|5.0|just enough difficulty to keep it interesting and entertaining without total frustration. the graphics were good and it was relaxing
0307888681|5.0|Rather than take a stab at the over done and never successful \\"let's explain what/how the zombie apocalypse started\\" Max Brookes instead gives us a look into the world after the ZA.<br /><br />Brookes' insight and knowledge of current political, cultural, and social attitudes paints a  pre and post apocalyptic world in which the actions of both individuals and entire countries are so believable you forget you are reading a work of fiction.<br /><br />While unnervingly real, WWZ doesn't let the reader forget that it is a work of horror. Brookes' zombies are relentless, inexhaustible, and frighteningly palpable.<br /><br />Brookes takes the reader on a realistic tour of world history before and after the ZA introducing us to larger than life heroes, lucky individuals, cruel opportunists, and average folk doing the best they can while never letting the reader forget that death or worse is just around the corner.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There are just too many repeating sentences. More than 10%. Once you start skipping the text it gets boring. Some words like fxxx are repeated just too many times. We in Europe do not consider man-woman sex relationship the same teen-age like as written in this book. More than 10% of the book contains just one-liner e-mails. Boring.<br />Boring book on the whole, when it could have been a fine book if these repeats were not included.<br />The sex games is totally un-interesting! Boring.<br />[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game because its addictive  and fun ill never stop playing so many games to choose from = so much fun
B0002IVN9W|5.0|several years ago I had heard and read all about Arcade Fire and was curious-curiosity satisfied back then when I woke up during a 2008 Austin city limits performance....What a live band! So I got Neon Bible sight unseen....it is a good enough album...but lacked the energy....I took my time buying The Suburbs-which is a really good album...but after the most recent performance on Austin City Limits, I finally got Funeral. THIS is what I have witnessed in those live performances. Maybe because of the fact that it was tracked on analog tape first or what but this is an absolutely wonderful album. See if you can listen to \\"Wake Up\\" twice and not spend the rest of the day \\"singing\\" the chorus or humming the verses.....
B004O3YGMC|5.0|great way to access all of your files on the go and it is easy to navigate even on a smaller screen.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I downloaded this app right when the kindle fire came out and within the past month it has been force closing everytime I try to open it, waste of my time. I had to unistall it.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Can't save except to Facebook or Twitter, so it loses its effectiveness with such a limited venue. Can't rotate. The stickers are fun and can be resized and rotated. Effects are the standards available on many free apps. Editting is easy. Nice frames.
0385344228|5.0|Andy Barber lives in a rather wealthy suburban area of Massachusetts with his wife Laurie and his 14 year old son Andy.  He has been a district attorney in the community for over twenty years and is considered the number two man.<br />Life can change in a split second and that is what happened.<br /><br />One morning the body of Ben Rifkin is found stabbed to death on his way to school.  At first Andy definitely wants to be involved in the case as he feels if there is a murderer out there it could effect his son and wants to take the case. Once some evidence is found it becomes a shocking possibly that his own son Jacob might of been the murder and he is taken off the case but not before Ben's dad gets involved.<br /><br />The family is in shock and of course Andy is sure his son would and could not kill anyone or anything.  We are now brought into the past and learn about secrets that Andy has kept from his wife Laurie all of there life and also when Laurie talks to a therapist many things about Jacob as a child are revealed.<br /><br />Until the trial gets underway they are virtrually prisoners in there own home as there friends have dropped them and nobody wants to have anything to do with them.  Andy is let go with pay and of course cannot have anything to do with the case but he hires a lawyer Jonathan who will let him be second chair to him.<br /><br />What unfolds is a riveting story of love, lies, secrets and questions as to whether or not they believe there son is possibly guilty of murder?  You won't' be able to put it down once you start it and if you think you are done when a verdict is reached think again as this is a page turner till the very last page.<br /><br />I had never read anything from this author before but will now want to read all his books.  It was compelling, exciting and frightening at times for what is coming next.  A must read if you enjoy mysteries as this will have you guessing till the very last page.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Our whole family loves playing games on this app. There is something for everyone! Plus we like the challenge of trying to open all the games.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I gave this cd as a gift and it was in perfect condition. It's a great soundtrack.The person I gave it to was very excited to receive it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am addicted! just started playing it on my laptop loved it, so I had to see if I could play it on my kindle too. try it you will love it.
0385340567|4.0|As opposed to those who didn't care for this Jack Reacher novel....I thought it was one of his best. It was more intricate than most, and I thoroughly enjoyed his \\"taking down\\" multiple attackers.  I thought much of it was tongue in cheek, and it seemed richer for it.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|This was a great movie overall. Taught a good lesson to officers as well as other persons. It didn't have quite the effect on me since I am not a father, but it was still a great movie. If you are a father I would highly recommend this movie regardless of whether you are in law enforcement or not.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|well, i like this app but the levels get a little boring. i am good at. volleyball and like pie. :P
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I was lucky enough to be sent this book but I'd have paid for it if I'd have know how good it was.<br /><br />Honestly when I first started reading it, it took a bit of time to get into.  Much like a rollercoster.  It gave you this false sense of security and then all of a sudden it kicks off and it's a rush from then on out.  It is on my phone so whenever I had a free moment at home, work anywhere I took it out to read.  It was 'unputdownable'!<br /><br />I loved the characters and how they develope throughout the story.  Sophia, the main character, is very likeable and you can relate to some of her traits.  The buzzing in her head developes into something unexpected (which I thought was a fantastic idea).  Without giving too much away I liked her love interest and how it developes btw them.  Slow, steady build up ... nicely written.<br /><br />I would recommend this to all young and not so young adult fantasy fiction readers.  I'm hooked and looking forward to the next installment.
B0063IH60K|5.0|well I am not sure I have that many words describing. the game but its winable. so my review. is good
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this app is so fun I cant stop freaking playing it. and who ever says its not free your plain out.stupid. GET THIS DONT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS!!!!!!!
031617615X|1.0|Ok, I hate to write a bad review and I know that it won't matter to most people but I was really disappointed in this one.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the book Twilight, even though I'm an adult!  I thought it was brilliantly written.  I couldn't put it down.  It was so good that I was willing to overlook the sparkly vampire part which is really the only thing I had a problem with initially.<br /><br />I understand why Stephanie Meyer would turn this into a series, she'd created great characters and had the makings of a love triangle.  I didn't like New Moon and Eclipse as well as Twilight but the extreme letdown came with Breaking Dawn.  Personally, I just thought things became ridiculous in general, and the idea of 'imprinting' which I believe had already been introduced kind of creeped me out.  There were certain things that happened in the plot of this book that all readers were rooting for (I won't say in case it's a spoiler for anyone) and I was glad to see them resolved but I honestly found myself wishing the Volturi would show up and waste everyone by the time I was halfway through this.<br /><br />I do hate to blast the book because I do think Meyer did an amazing job with 'Twilight' from a literary point of view and obviously the entire series is a huge hit with fans.  I'm happy she's met with great success, she deserves it and for a new author to hit a home run as big as this series is amazing and inspiring.  I just really wish I could have liked this book!<br /><br />I had heard that she planned a fifth book but it was 'leaked' so she scrapped it.  If that's true, that's unfortunate because it means that Breaking Dawn really wasn't intended to end the series.  I still didn't like the direction it went in, but maybe the 5th book would have been better?
B0052UZIFA|2.0|great game but does not work on the new os. Needs to be updated to work on ics. 5 stars when it is updated.
B0063GORYU|3.0|good app easy to play the app is similar to. the computer game and is addicting when you start playing
B000TCEU4Q|1.0|Two entire hours I had this before it failed.. The throttle and prop RPM would spike. Soon as I moved either up off 0% on the throttle or prop RPM nothing would happen until it just spiked at 50% power for either quadrant.. There was no in between 0-49% You could sit and watch this take place in Windows during calibration as the little calibration X would just snap into position. Nothing would fix it, no amount of calibrating would fix it.. Pure and utter junk.
B003ASLJMW|5.0|This movie is wonderful.It is far much better than any nonsense of hollywood in 2000s.The end of the cold war dramaticly reduced the quality of the American movie industry.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Item was recieved fast. I have not seen the movie myself yet, but other people in my family have and enjoyed it very much
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Great game.  Combines 2D strategy (&quot;bubble blast 2&quot;) with timing. It's like &quot;cut the rope&quot; in that regard. Good challenge for 8+ kids too.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Item was delivered fast. I watched the movie and enjoyed it very much. The special effects were incredibale. it was impossible to tell the difference between live action and CGI.
0763655465|5.0|I don't know about a message...it was pure entertainment for me! I bought this book to take to my cousin's children, Aidan (6) and Maya (2), this coming weekend. I just hope they love the book as much as I do! (I'll let you know.)<br />The illustrations are simple but even in their simplicity (like the placement/position of the eyes) they capture all of the emotion of the text. My favorite page is when George, the dog, offers his favorite toy to Harry, his human companion, in compensation for the mess he has made...it's so funny and touching at the same time. If there is a message involved it's more about kindness and forgiveness. The ending opens up your imagination to and a conversation or a debate to what George will do now when faced with another naughty thing he likes to do...what will he do?
0060512806|5.0|Enjoying a writer is not a passive process. One has to work at it and here one does. At over 900 pages with many diversions and side stories the story all comes together. The plot is very straightforward and the narrative is easy to follow. I learned a great deal more than I already known about many issues - cryptography, ww2, philippines and much more. There were some real laugh out loud moments. This is a book that will stay in my head. I'd rather have 900 pages of this than 10 books of mediocre nonsense. I was sad to finish it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book continued with the love story developing and maturing between Ana and Christian.  This book is a roller coaster of emotions, with you hoping and praying that any differences and problems can be sorted out, hoping no one interferes.  Christian seems to come so far emotionally with one seen in the book showing this but also showing that he doesn't yet fully understand all the emotions and trust that is needed.<br /><br />I loved this book, its much more than just a story about BDSM, like some books can be, just looking at sex between master and submissive, its a emotional love story.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Please add:  gofotit33<br />I will tip and gift you daily.  Let's grow our restaurants together.<br /><br />Please add:  goforit33<br />Please add:  goforit33
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The changes in the relationship and the trust that has developed between Christian and Ana is amazing by the end of the third book.  It is lovely to see even though there were times when things looked to go all the way back to the beginning.<br /><br />The learning of love and trust is wonderful and beautifully written.  There is closure on certain questions which invoke emotion.<br /><br />I couldn't believe that the books were over, and am hoping that E.L James decides to write some more involving the characters, there is so much more I would want to know.<br /><br />Overall one of my favorite things in the books was Ana's inner goddess and subconscious having there own 'personalities' that were illustrated beautifully
1908117230|1.0|After trying several recipes in this book I honestly have to wonder whether they even tried these recipes as written.  There are a number of problems with the book.<br /><br />- It uses a more complicated meringue technique, requiring you to boil sugar to the soft-ball stage.  This isn't necessarily wrong or a problem except that most of the recipes call for you to whip only half the egg whites, and for some strange reason pour the other half over the ground almond & powdered sugar mixture with explicit \\"do not stir\\" instructions<br /><br />- Most of the recipes require exotic or esoteric ingredients, including titanium oxide powder, coffee extract, rose syrup, brands of butter available only in France, etc.<br /><br />- The translations are often times wonky/off (\\"tip the ingredients into the bowl\\")<br /><br />- The recipes yield an insane amount of filling and shells that is beyond what any home cook would ever need or want.<br /><br />There is a \\"32 step\\" approach to the meringue shells but little if any explanation of why you're doing what you're doing.  For example, why do half the egg whites get added directly to the almond mixture  but not stirred?  Why an Italian meringue instead of a French meringue?<br /><br />I don't know whether it's just the results of bad translation, but the recipes I tried from this book were a massive disappointment.  The coffee shells for the coffee macarons came out way too thin.  The coffee ganache made with white chocolate was way too thin as well even after hours of refrigeration, and could easily have been made without buying coffee extract.  The rose buttercream failed to come together.<br /><br />I went back to using recipes from Laduree's \\"The Sweet\\" cookbook, and Les Petits Macarons, which is probably the best reference on macarons.  Buy that book for the recipes, this one is good for little more than the photos.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book, the BDSM lifestyle was explained in a way that I understood.  The emotions between the Ana and Christian were amazing.  The love that builds makes you follow and feel their ups and downs, when things are going wrong you feel horrible and waiting for the up moments.<br /><br />I loved watching the characters change and develop, by the end of the book I was buying the second book immediately to find out what will happen.<br /><br />I loved that there is 3 books, this makes the story and love between the characters carry on for a little bit longer
B002Z7FWBI|3.0|Is this set in widescreen or TV format? Only 1 review I've seen mentions that it's widescreen, but the set's description lists the format as being 1:33.
B00422LESO|4.0|A sweet & innocent romance with enough zing to make it interesting! Yes it is somewhat predictable ,but I find that comfortng! Definitely true to the Austen style & another winner for Shannon Hale. I plan to buy the others in this series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Whenever I think I'm Tired of Stephen King, he writes something as good as this. Loved it.  Read it on my Kindle app.  if you're a King fan, you won't be disappointed:)
0307279189|5.0|I picked this book up not knowing really what I wanted from it, but something in the title and the first few pages drew me to it. As an occasional runner with a slightly kranky knee I was inspired by the suggestion that we were born to run, and that it should actually be an enjoyable experience. So I am slowly changing my diet and employing a forefoot running technique, and smiling while running. This book is really worth a read, and reinforces that it's the simple things in life that matter. Running & feeling free as a bird, eating simple healthy meals, inter-dependency on & loving our fellow humans, and not focussing on the material things that surround us.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the quick games. good way to relax and kill some time. looking forward to advancing to more games.
B0041D843M|5.0|This may be one of the most significant books ever written about nutrition, and the health of us individually and as a nation. Even as a die-hard carnivore in good health (except for a recent spike in cholesterol), it has not been as difficult as I thought to make some significant changes to a plant-based, whole foods way of eating. I would say that if there is ONE book everyone should read, this is it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|No matter what trouble seems to come your way God knew it would happen before it came about. He is there to answer your prayer and His Word. will give you comfort along the way. Having it at the touch of your fingers in any version makes it the &quot;best&quot; reading Book ever put in print or e-tab. Perfect reading in any book! In the Masters Service, JW
0439023521|5.0|This book is amazing. People shouldn't compare it to twilight. The Hunger Games is way better. Its more about being strong whereas twilight is about a dumb girl that can't choose between a vampire or werewolf. People need to read the Hunger Games:)
0439023521|5.0|The shaking feeling of being watched by ever corner and every inch of were u lay. Having to sacrafice all you love and have for something you despritaly need. The hunger games is a book so amazing, it caught me off guard. Honestly, when i first read about two chapters of the book- i didn't like it, but more and more people kept telling me how good it was-and soon enough-a friend of mine started to explain. As she explained more and more, i found my self captivated by the horrors these children and young teens need to face during this mission for food. Figures, i'm so surprised, i couldn't even hold the book up-right and i'm still tingling now. My heart is were my throat is and my chest is sealed so tightly that I feel as if i'm losing my breath. The hunger games is a book recommend for adults and teens, any age, who is willing to read it. But i warn you, this book has many wonders and many surprises up ahead-you wont even know what hit you until a few minutes after. I am a very hard girl to please when it comes to books, I'm very choosy, but this is one of the best written books ever written. Breath taking-amazing literature-and crafty thinking-piece by piece this book perfectly like a puzzle.
B0058VW36U|1.0|it just wont allow me to install for some reason I hope they will fix that problem very very soon
B002QKZLZ6|2.0|While the case keeps the headset safe and readily available you'll find the soft leather case becomes quickly deformed if worn regularly on your belt.  If the case had a stiffer construction it would easily have been 5 star.

B000W8HC8I|5.0|This book is one big party of drugs and hookers and money. Very fast paced you won't be bored. Even if you don't know or<br />Care about wall street or the business of investment banking it's a great read. Towards the end of the book it shifts to more<br />Of a recovery related book and the party ends  but it makes for a well rounded read. One of the best books I've read in a while.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just got this game and its really fun. they practically give away points, which is great if the games are too hard. for example, if you lose 5 times they will give you 1,000 points for persistence. the games are super ultra awesomely COOL!
B00628CCQY|5.0|I am a Dream Theater fan and i saw a song of them on youtube being sang by the singer of Opeth so i thought i would give them a try. if this band is classified as death metal, then they are the pink floyd of this genre. I am addicted to their music now... seriously...give them a try! you wont be sorry.
B004SBX112|5.0|It is a good game it don't crash,freezes. it comes with updates ,has everything,that its supposed to have,it comes with 2012 and 2011
0446573019|4.0|Yes, another Army CID superman. If there were really guys like these, there would be almost no crimes unsolved. I do agree with other about the similarities but I still like the character. David wanted to branch out with a different kind of hero.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game! I love how it has lots of games into one game. I thought it was a good game on my itouch, its even better on the kindle fire
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|Seems like someone said \\"let's see if we can squeak even more revenue out of the Band of Brothers success\\". The acting fell far short of the original, although the filming was decent. The story line was disjunct and you never quite got to know any of the characters. I'm not a prude but I didn't appreciate the unnecessary nudity (somewhat of an HBO trademark I guess). Finally, as a music lover, the score just never hit home for me. I'll probably donate this to the library. I won't want to watch it repeatedly as I do with Band of Brothers.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It took about 10 bottles to get use to it, but since then I've had great odds at cutting the bottles in half. The secret is using a 90 degree cut, that's not too deep, use thick bottles (chapagne bottles worked best), and the tea kettle / cold water method. The glass hammer it comes with is worthless, as is the sand paper. A dremel with a diamond grinder works best at removing the sharp edges. I plan on never buying glassware again. For $25 it's well worth the fun. Plus, I get .05 cents for each bottle I return, but If I make something out of it I can get 1.00 or more. I also like that it comes with a good glass cutter that has 6 blades that can be moved, so you can easily cut 100 bottles before needing a new cutter.
