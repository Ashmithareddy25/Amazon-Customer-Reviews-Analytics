B00006AL1G|5.0|I recommend this piece of art to EVERYONE! I was recently told that DJ's only got famous in the past year or so because of Dubstep. I nearly p*ssed on myself laughing. Rap music ( hip hop ) was born out of the turntable and its abilities. Much love to Kool DJ Herc!<br />From Kook Herc, Grand wizard Theodore, Bambaattaa, to Mix Master Mike, Roc Raida ( rip ) this DVD has all the talent in it.<br /><br />I miss the days when the MC would brag on how his DJ was the best......  88'

B00486070K|4.0|Works ok. BUT Stay with the Apple model - cheaper models don't work as original. That one had the plastic sheath on the USB portion of the connector break and pull away in the first week of use.
161218412X|4.0|The packaging was not that great. The collection had shifted around and banged the corners up. Not the end of the world. I have not opened it yet. Looks good on the bookshelf though.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this app but the amount of times that it asked me to rate it is just annoying. It is a very fun app and I would still recommend it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|As always, Rush delivers music with outstanding quality, both in the composition and the recording /audio categories. Great, very well epected CD after the &#34;sneak prevew&#34; of the songs 'BU2B' and 'Caravan', shown on the Time Machine Tour. Great as always. Go Rush and welcome to the Rock and Roll Hal of Fame!
B0085YNML2|5.0|soo fun and so far addictive.. lol really cool features on the kindle fire! really fun but sortable like cut the rope...

B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG!!! So explaining and shocking!!by far the best book I've ever read I absolutely love it  Katniss is truly a moking jay
0345525558|5.0|A very interesting, entertaining novel. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and felt the author presented the story through such a unique lens with a dense knowledge of flowers and their meanings.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I love this game u have to get it. its the best game in the world I am so excited its avalible for the kindle
B0053O89Z6|5.0|The DVD arrived quickly and without hassle. I am already a fan of the show and didn't have any issues when catching up on the 7th season.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|One of the best books i've ever read. testosterone fueled book. i loved travis- he's funny, annoying, loving, caring and confused! plus he is hot, and every girl wants to be with him. i loved how this book slowly unfold all the secrets of abby and oh my god, the vegas trip, the underground matches and travis' dramatic speeches were really a movie material. i just hope that they would do a great film out of this story. I am excited and couldn't wait to see it on cinema.
0525478817|5.0|...until I finished the book. I usually like to pace myself so as to not abruptly leave a world that I've just entered. But I literally could not put this book down untll I had finished it 4 hours later. This book is heartbreakingly beautiful, but it is also much more. One but need read the first few pages in order to be pulled into this love story of an infinite nature.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great blue-ray uplift. When you compare to DVD- there is no fuzzy zones. The grey/blue and army greens are sharper. As for the films- scary as they were when they were first released.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Even when I find myself amongst small children,  this is my GO -TO app to share and engage them. Or I have even settled a kid in church sitting next to me<br /> with this engaging and quiet app. The parents were happy and I felt good cause something I had helped. I find this meditative and &quot;decompressing&quot;. Good Job!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Watching the Godfather films, one right after the other, is an awesome experience. Coppola's story unflolds as brilliantly as he created it. A film that will stand the test of time- even after the Mayan calendar expires this week.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|It's one of my favorite movies though :)<br /><br />Got this Pack for less than $9.00<br /><br />I still haven't downloaded the digital copy :P
B000KJT8IG|5.0|The perfect dysfunctional Christmas holiday movie. Wonderful lines, reactions, characters and story. Fun times are at home. It is more of a tradition than A Christmas Carol or Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer ever was. Gut-wrenching humor. Chevy Chase plays the perfect Griswold sap and Randy Quaid as the adorable dufus, Cousin Eddie.
1608100197|5.0|\\"Mark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.\\" (Page 5)<br /><br />Most of us are procrastinating on something that must be accomplished for us to move forward and achieve success. Yet we delay and come up with a million excuses why it isn't happening. We turn to social media to waste even more time.<br /><br />In short chapters loaded with easy-to-apply material, Brian Tracy gives readers 21 different methods of overcoming procrastination. I read a chapter a day and appreciated the sound counsel. I plan to read this book from time to time and reapply the information to my daily life. I highly recommend this book.
B00021R7CG|4.0|Covers military aspect of command and control during a nuclear war.  Good Movie.  Good acting, and scary movie if you think about it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great product. easy to use! it has big buttons so its easy for any finger size. its also fun and old school in a way.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|After being unimpressed with the last couple LP records, I ended up hearing a stream of this album online and loved it.  Easily one of their most accomplished records with a unique sound that is very much both classic Linkin Park and an evolution of the brand.  Looking forward to seeing more from them in this vein.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The collection of actors in this Wes Anderson flic compares to none before!  From beginning to end, any Wes Anderson fan will love this movie!
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Mr. Kaufmann possesses a warm and brilliant tenor voice that is completely at home in the italian, french and german operatic repertoire.  This CD is sure to please anyone who spends their time listening to this major artist.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|A hostile nation is holding 52 members of the embassy staff hostage. While the majority of the State Department is focused on those hostages, six members of the embassy staff have sought refuge with the Canadian ambassador. How would you get them out? Could you get them out?<br /><br />  Thanks to the U.S. allowing their deposed leader to seek refuge in America, the Iranian people storm the American embassy on November 4, 1979. The staff is rushing to shred or burn all their confidential files. The majority of the staff are held hostage while a small percentage escape unnoticed. The State Department begins planning a rescue and asks the CIA to consult. It's abundantly clear to the Agency's \\"exfiltration\\" specialist, Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck), that the State Department is in over their heads. With such plans as having the embassy workers ride to the border disguised as teachers on bicycles in winter. It was back in his hotel watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and talking to the son Ian (played by Aidan Sussman) that Tony (Affleck) has an idea. Disguise the hostages as a film crew and sneak them out right under the enemy's nose. After bringing the idea to his boss, Jack O'Donnell (played by Bryan Cranston) the plan gets the go-ahead. Later, they approach the make-up specialist who worked on The Planet of the Apes who has also done work for the Agency in the past, John Chambers (played by John Goodman). Chambers in turn introduces Mendez to a well-known producer named Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin). Once they've chosen a script, Argo, a science-fiction fantasy in the style of Star Wars, they go the extra mile in establishing it as a legitimate enterprise. Where it was simply a poster in the beginning, Siegel organizes a table-reading with known actors, press, and studio staff. While all this is going on, the Iranian government has sweatshop labor assembling the shredded photos so that they can identify anyone who they failed to capture. Also, our six escapees become increasingly fearful that they will be discovered.<br /><br />  I'm kind of a sucker for movies based on factual events, no matter how much the narrative diverges from history. A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, some that don't have Russell Crowe as the lead actor. That said, it doesn't guarantee I will like it. Case in point, I found J. Edgar unbelievably dissatisfying. Argo, on the other hand, is brilliant, in my opinion. The story is gripping, the comic relief is hilarious, and the suspense has me on the edge of my seat. As a lead actor, Affleck has had some notable flops. Gigli and Surviving Christmas among them. As the director of Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and now Argo, however, he is now three for three. You should definitely see this movie.r six escapees become increasingly fearful that they will be discovered.<br /><br />  I'm kind of a sucker for movies based on factual events, no matter how much the narrative diverges from history.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|What an idea for a book!  To think of people who have lost loved ones to suicide and having their suicide haunt them but also the audio tapes of why they did it.  Touching, heartfelt and an idea of what teens/kids go through on a regular basis as life and growing up happens.  Highly recommended.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Snow White is one of the oldest fairy tales ever written. Also the one most recently turned into a feature film. Less than three months ago, in fact. Is this Universal Pictures offering better or just some carbon copy?<br /><br />  Snow White (played as a young woman by Raffey Cassidy) is the child of a benevolent king and a woman who died as a result of complications arising from childbirth. Despite her tragedy, however, she has a happy childhood. Then her father takes up arms against a dark army. The soldiers in that army, while capable of striking blows as fierce as any and fiercer than some, breaks like glass when struck by the enemy. With the dark army vanquished, the king inspects a carriage that survived the battle and finds a woman inside. The woman, Ravenna (played by Charlize Theron), soon marries the king who fell in love with her at first sight. She appears to have genuine affection for the king and Snow in the short period leading up to the wedding, but that is, of course, a ruse. On their wedding night, she murders her husband while her brother Finn (played by Sam Spruell) overruns the kingdom with the help of that same dark army that the king believed had kidnapped Ravenna. Snow attempts to flee, but is captured and imprisoned in the palace tower. Years pass and Ravenna maintains her beauty and youth by draining the life from young women whose beauty might one day surpass her own. Those women are identified by the queen's mirror and chief advisor (voiced by Christopher Obi Ogugwa). When she reaches adulthood, the mirror tells Ravenna that she may maintain her youth indefinitely if she kills Snow White and takes out her heart. Snow (now played by Kristen Stewart) escapes the kingdom when the queen sends her brother to escort her.<br /><br />  Obviously, there's a great deal more to the story. For example, the Huntsman has yet to be introduced. Neither, for that matter, have the dwarves. And in this film, the men portraying the dwarves are of average or above average stature made to look like dwarves through the use of special effects as opposed to men who are actually shorter than 4'10\\". There are comparisons being made between this film and Mirror Mirror, but they have very little in common, outside of the main characters. If more time had passed between the release dates, they'd stand separately and they should. It's like comparing Ridley Scott's Robin Hood to Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I won't say this film lived up to the hype but, given the degree, I doubt any film could've. I will say it's a quality film and you should see it.above average stature made to look like dwarves through the use of special effects as opposed to men who are actually shorter than 4'10\\".

1600108512|5.0|I have been a fan of the animated movie since childhood, so I decided to finally read the novel it was based on. I avoided reading the novel in case it changed that warm fuzzy feeling I get watching the movie, but was gratified to learn that while some things were changed or left out, the overall feel and essence of the book translated to the film. Peter S. Beagle's flowing words and sharp imagery comes through wonderfully, and unicorns never seemed more magical. I love how the story is a fairy tale of sorts, but not of the princesses needing rescue type. Our hero is the unicorn, the others mere players around her shining star, and she is the one who ultimately prevails. Even at the cost of human love. Such a beautiful story.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a pretty good read. I like the fact that it wasn't an Obama bashing but he seemed to know the real deal.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Arrived in time for gift and was in great shape.  I know it will be a very thankful gift.  Thanks.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It keeps you guessing, the characters are rich and real in detail. Loved it. It's one of the best suspense books I've read in a long time!
B0037KMHRY|5.0|If you're a fan of Techno/Electronica with Orchestral thrown in (or if you just loved the music in the movie), this is an album for you.  I loved every bit of it, have had it for several years now, and still enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm no audiophile, but with the right system, this sounds amazing.  Sadly, I had a Polk Audio soundbar for my TV and the movie nearly blew it out during some of the \\"epic\\" music moments, so be aware!
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah Carrey sings the best Christmas songs, from gospel to pop. Anyone young or old would enjoy every song on this album!
B0006JGFNQ|3.0|This isn't the highest quality product, but after ready the reviews across various sites, i knew what i was getting.  it will still be a nice part of our christmas this year.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly this game runs.  The ads can be gotten rid of in an instant.  Good mindless fun to play quickly anywhere.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app, great when I'm out and need a calculator. Like right now when I'm trying to figure out how much my college books are going to cost.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|bought this movie for my daughter to put into her collection for my future grandchildren.  hear it is a great movie, have not seem it myself
B0053O89Z6|4.0|This is one of my favorite shows and I own every season. I was on the edge of my seat wanting to see what would happen, and there was a lot that happened this season. Perhaps it was because I watched all the episodes in a relatively short amount of time, but it felt like they were trying to fit way too many life altering events in for one season- that and it seemed to lose some of the humor as many of the episodes had a pretty serious tone to them. I also wih they wouldn't stray from the traditional personalities they established in all the previous seasons- seems like they keep forgetting what they have established to be the standard Robin, Ted, Barney way of doing things. That being said it is still a great show and I was entertained as usual- Just different from previous seasons.
1933865474|5.0|Excellent complilation of Bruce Timm's images. Images are categorized according to style not chroniilogically. This edition provides excellent value and overview. A good introduction to Bruce's work and style for the collector not familar with his works.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My girls 4&2 they both loved it!! They got a thing for Tinker Bell!!! Great for the family!! Great for a toddlers girls sleepover,
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|Have purchased 2 of these in the last 18 months.  Both went bad.  I've now moved on to a different brand.  Buy something else.  It can't be any worse.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  There is enough depth to the charactors that I was really interested in what happened to them.  The plot was not predictable & the &#34;world&#34; presented was believable.  Overall for me it was a real page turner.  I look forward to seeing what happens next.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It started off as a page-turner, with intriguing ideas and fun characters, before coming to a grinding halt once our hero, Jake/George, gets cozy in a small Texas town and makes friends. This section goes on for way longer than I cared for. Eventually it picks back up and ends in a satisfying way. It would have benefited with tighter editing, but when has Stephen King ever been able to practice restraint?
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I looked all over for this movie and found that this is the best site to order movies and CDs at the best price
B008NMT684|5.0|my son loves this app i got the paid version because the free version only has a few puzzles but the other ones are shadowed out so the child can see them but can't play with them
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Pinch to zoom works fine on galaxy S 2. Storyline is ok, enjoyable way to pass the time. Would buy another from this company.

B008XX6J4C|4.0|I have enjoyed the Piano Guys YouTube videos and now have been enjoying their music in the car.  Unfortunately, the Cello Wars video doesn't quite translate to audio-only, and some of the effects on other songs seem synthesized and therefore are grating, but overall their talent is impressive.  This is the first CD I've felt like buying in quite a while and I'm glad I did.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|great app my son really likes this.  its hard to find things challenging for his young little mind but this did the trick
B008J34466|5.0|P!nk is known for her raw lyrics and amazing vocals, and she delivers again in the awesome CD! The songs are catchy and she sounds the best she ever has! Not to be listened to while kids are around though!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever!!! I know it doesn't go completely with the book but I still love it!!!!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Thrilling movie, there are some moments where it lags and I saw the ending coming before it was given away. Still a great film and the actors are brilliant
0767020308|4.0|I have the &#34;Emma&#34; with Gwyneth Paltrow, I like this one the best of the two but both are cute..
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|As a Austen fan I thought I would enjoy the novel 'Jane Eyre' and I fell in love with the story immediately. Naturally however that made me very nervous about seeing the movie. I find the casting very agreeable and the scenes much like the novel, dark and dreary (as it should be) but brilliantly done. Gotta admit that B (not spoiling anything here for someone who might not know the story) freaked me the hell out lol.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it!! it gives your kids some entertainment while playing and is very addictive.its a perfect app and is great that it doesn't cost money
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I hadn't heard of Mumford and Sons until a year or so ago and have been basically obsessed ever since. I do find this album better than the newest one, it just feels more raw and soulful.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game so much ive been playing it on my iphone I was sobexcited when it came out for the kindle
0345529057|5.0|I ordered this set of books because I loved the HBO series.  The books are so much deeper than the series, and this box set is a great way to pick them all up for a terrific price.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|Can;t really say much about this movie. I forgot to see it and now lost my chance. gotta rent it again.
B00973DDN2|3.0|slow, not what they used to be, but good<br />worth seeing them live again and again<br />maybe next album will be better
B0017XD3OY|3.0|[Good]<br /><br />The movie starts off really really awesome. Everything about it is perfect. Civilization is just gone. There's some unknown scary craziness that you can't see. It's just great horror with a  lot of suspense.<br /><br />Will Smith is a good lead.<br /><br />[Bad]<br /><br />Sadly after about 1/4 or 1/2 of the film it just goes really downhill.<br /><br />The choice to make all the monsters in CG was just really horrible. Once you see the monsters all you can think of is how cheap and crappy they look. I don't understand how people in the movie industry tend to forget that what scares people the most is the stuff that you can't see.<br /><br />Another horrible choice is just that the movie just deviates so much from the book's major plot points that the movie's title isn't even relevant anymore. If you ever get a chance to read the book, you'll understand why.<br /><br />Both the director and writer just pretty much ruined something that could have been really great.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|While it may not have all the bells and whistles it is an excellent look at the weather for each day and very quick look at the weather for the next few days. I have used it both<br />on my original Kindle Fire and my new Kindle Fire HD 89.
B00123IATW|5.0|Another album for those that want to relive a sound of the past. Yes was a real tight band and this album has some of their really good work.
0143123173|5.0|I read this book after seeing the TV show.  How did I miss it before that?  Becasue it is a \\"western\\"?  I am on board now and all caught up with the series. Walt Longmire is a great character, with deep passions about the people and palces he serves as Sherrif.  His side-kick is unique as are the other supporting characters.  Don't miss this series!
B004QX07G4|3.0|I like Ellen and often watch her TV show, however this book didn't follow any kind of format so I haven't finished reading it as I found it rather boring.
0385535147|4.0|I have closed some of Grisham's more recent works without finishing them.  But this one I blew through within 24 hours.  Clean, clear writing and an interesting protganist propelled the story along.  Not a mystery and not a thriller, I would call it a legal caper.  The main character is a disbarred lawyer who uses his knowledge of criminal law - and the identity of a killer - to elverage his way out of prison. My only complaint is that like many Grisham novels the protaganist is just too good...everything goes his way and he is invincible...
B001AUKUS6|4.0|this used to be one of my fav. cassettes when i was a teen.  it brings me back whenever i hear it.  thanks to hairnation on xm, i couldn't help but buy it again so many years later.
B000F8O35U|4.0|My daughter loved it.  It brought back memories when i use to work at block buster video.  Kids and adults alike would sit there and watch the video as we replayed it over and over again.
B0000071GA|4.0|i really only bought it for one song, but it was like a blast from the past.  the 80's rocked!
B008KWHM6U|5.0|I rarely write reviews for CD's, but this is a freaking amazing album! I enjoyed every single track, and I feel like I could listen to this no matter what mood I'm in. It's both high energy and and deeply introspective at certain points, I absolutely fell in love with this album.
B003ES61EE|5.0|this buyer was very fast and prompt and easy to work with. will have repeat business from me and my friends. the product is very uself and doeas exactly what i need it to.
B000002VMD|5.0|I am a die hard fan of Miss Whitney Houston. I Love her music & it is such a joy to have anything that her voice has ever touched. I  miss her like she was a close relative of mine. Thanks for the soundtrack.
1417734035|5.0|My kids are constantly asking me to draw tractors and trains and animals for them. I have little to no drawing skills and am often daunted by their requests. Ed Emberley has made this task a simple and fun one. Highly recommend this book.
B000RF7XYO|1.0|I was unimpressed with this movie because it had nothing to do with FACT for one thing, and the acting itself was poor. Its not a good buy at all. You want real history about Elizabeth, go to the library and get it. I also ordered  *Elizabeth The Golden Age, but when it arrives I will send it right back immediately! I am very dis-appointed!
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|Well, for me it's really hard to review this album by Rihanna, since I loved &#34;Talk That Talk&#34;, and I was expecting this album to sound more like TTT. I was really surprised and excited at the same time to find out that Rihanna is going back to her R&B roots in this record, &#34;Unapologetic&#34; is a surprisingly good album. Even though everybody knows she rarely writes her music, you can notice that she's more involved with the music in this album, this album is SO Rihanna. Tracks like &#34;Phresh Out The Runaway&#34;, &#34;Numb&#34;, &#34;Get It Over With&#34;, &#34;Loveeeeee Song&#34; and &#34;Pour It Up&#34; go to a more R&B, guetto/hood direction. While she flirts with dubstep and EDM in songs like &#34;Jump&#34;, &#34;Right Now&#34; and &#34;Lost In Paradise&#34;. The shocking duet with her abusing ex Chris Brown (&#34;Nobody's Business), is one of the best tracks in &#34;Unapologetic&#34;, it has a very 90's dance music vibe. But the 2-part song &#34;Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary&#34; is one of the most personal songs Rihanna has ever made, it's just an amazing song, with her uplifting vocals. Well, &#34;Diamonds&#34; of course is her latest hit and an uplifting pop ballad, with electronic influences. To sum it up, &#34;Unapologetic&#34; is a great record, that returns to the music she use to make on her &#34;Good Girl Gone Bad&#34; and &#34;Rated R&#34; albums, but even though I love Rihanna, I feel like she needs to go on vacation for like 2 years and come back with a kick-ass record.
B000QU3CKY|5.0|If you are a lover of Jazz and particularly Dexter Gordon this movie is a must see.<br />The story bends in and out and up and down the life of Dale Turner (Dexter Gordon) during<br />his time spent in Paris where he befriends a Parisian fellow &#34; Francis &#34;whose life was completely<br />transformed by the music.The movie presents a gathering of different musicians and ensembles all<br />the best of the best Bobby Huschinson Herbie Hancock Wayne Shorter John Mcglughlin Ron Carter and more<br />totally enjoyable
0547884591|5.0|I have all of Tim's books. They always have more information and things that you can learn from the most amazing perspective.

B002HK9IDQ|5.0|The digital copy was clear with great color and sound quality.  It's Audrey Hepburn, so you really can't go wrong.
0142410373|5.0|This book was for my 9 year old daughter and she loved it. Originally i bought it to replace one she lost & she was sad about the lost one. When she received this one she was overjoyed.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This is a great movie, it puts all the classic stars from the 80's and 90's Norris, Stallone, li, Schwarzenegger.<br />Its all here great cheesy one liners from Norris and Arnold, to the huge Bollywood explosions. I still think they should have brought back Mr. T, some how they should have tossed in a quick cameo from him just to have the one liner i pity the fool.<br />But if your a fan of action and saw the original Expendables, be sure to check out the 2nd.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great start for all the mystery and clue finding, puzzle games ... I liked it and was hooked on it until I passed it :)
B007IXWL2C|1.0|After reading the first two books, this was just more of the same.  Plotless without a lot of imagination.  Rich controlling boy meets uninterested money girl and live happily ever after.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased the Blu Ray edition of this movie.  Muppets Christmas Carol has been one of my family's favorite holiday movies since it was first released on VHS.  We have never seen the movie without \\"When Love Is Gone\\" and did not even know the theatrical release did not include this song until the invention of imdb many years later. I understand that song could seem \\"boring\\" to some children, so why not have the option to watch the movie with or without that scene? Like so many other movies with extended editions and deleted scenes included on the blu ray? The pacing of the ghost of Christmas past just seems so short without that song included and the scene seems to end so abruptly.<br /><br />In conclusion I probably would have been just as happy with my pan and scan DVD version because the better resolution doesnt make up for the fact that \\"When Love Is Gone\\" is missing.

0439023513|5.0|You were set up in book 1 and 2 to have everything shatter for you in book 3. Once everything shatters, you are left wondering how can they do this to Katniss? This is to much for all our characters?<br /><br />When starting this book you are left wondering what will happen to Snow and who will Katniss pick? Gale, her childhood companion or Peeta, the one who accompanied her to the Hunger Games twice. And how will she stop Snow if it is left up to her?<br /><br />Katniss wakes up to an unusual world and a very usual one all at the same time. She is still very stuck on her feelings. She is still stuck on Snow and she is still stuck on trust for this new District.<br /><br />Once all our emotions are in place, where we have hope even though she is stuck; the author drops us. This isn't a story of love and happily ever after, this is a story of war. And what it means to be a volunteer and yet still be a pawn.<br /><br />All of that is bigger than a love story, than Peeta or Gale. And yet, Katniss' war does come to an end. And she does have to pick up the pieces of her life and figure out where to go at the end. She does make a choice. But compared to the tragedy of everything that comes before it, it doesn't seem fair. And I think that's the point. That once you've been to hell and lost so much, your life will never be the same. Katniss will never be the same. For a large part of this book, we see Katniss acting in a way that we can only see as being scared and stressed. This isn't our Katniss, this isn't our warrior girl.<br /><br />But this is what makes it so much more realistic.<br /><br />This is why I loved the epilogue. It really was perfect. It showed that there are reasons for living. That she can't just keep going. No one can just keep going.

B00005JNJV|5.0|As far as I am concerned, this movie is a discussion of evil.  At what point does the eradication of evil become evil?  I saw it at the movie theatres 6 times and purchased it as soon as it came out.  The movie provides not only action and a hero with humanity and human failings but it gives one food for thought.

0880796863|2.0|This printing of the Rider Waite deck is tarot-able!<br /><br />For the past 18 years or so I have worked as an (eyes open) Tarot Reader and the RW deck has been and still is my favorite deck.  In that time I have worn out many decks, and I have replaced them by going to a Hollywood store and getting a new deck. The previous time I needed a new deck I bought this item on-line, and I was very disappointed. The imaging is poor, and the feel of the cards is rather flimsy. I would not use this deck in my work as the crutch, as they are not as flashy as in years past by other suppliers.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|It was fun, I wont deny that. But, too short for my taste. Also, it was annoying the penalties &quot;for random tapping&quot; when I was zooming in the picture, or when the object was too small or out of the picture for me to see.<br />I insist, it was fun.

0446573027|5.0|One thing you can reliably say about books by David Baldacci is that they contain plots that race through the book like a runaway freight train. This book is no exception, and in addition introduces a new protagonist, John Puller, a military man who works to combat threats against the country, using an enormous array of different talents and abilities.<br /><br /> The plot begins when a mailman in a very rural West Virginia coal mining county comes upon a gruesome murder scene. Because one of the victims has ties to the military, Puller is sent to investigate. From the beginning, he has questions about his mission, because he is sent alone, rather than the usual method of a team of investigators.<br /><br /> Puller teams up with a local deputy sheriff, and together they look into a series of murders, which may or may not be connected. At times it appears that everyone in the small community has something to hide, and Puller discovers that his own life is in grave danger.<br /><br /> The plot goes roaring on and Puller and his deputy colleague uncover a plot that almost boggles the imagination. It is up to them to put an end to it, but time is growing very short. The last several chapters must be read at one sitting, for I don't believe the reader can put the book down at that point, until it ends.<br /><br /> It's another great read from Baldacci, and I'm happy to see that the author has already published another book featuring Puller. I know I'm going to read that one also!

0547884591|3.0|The book has a number of editing errors, including navigation loops that return you to a previous section.<br /><br />There are also steps left out of recipes.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|Excellent series! Did not have Showtime when first broadcast, so it was worth it to buy this and catch up, now that I have Showtime available!!
B006CC0YB0|5.0|Before purchasing this, all I had really heard from Lanegan was his work with Queens of the Stone Age and a very small portion of his prior solo material and I've always loved his work. This said, I can truthfully say that this is one of my best album purchases over the last year or two due to the album just being, well, excellent. The lyrics are awesome and the instrumentals or also great and, considering that I'm not typically a huge fan of computerized sounds, I was surprised by songs like \\"Ode to Sad Disco\\" on the album, being that it is my favorite song on the album. Excellent crafting and, as always, Lanegan is on point. His voice is truly unique and, for that matter, better than mostly everyone I've ever heard. You can hear the work that went into this album. Though this is solidly rock-ish in flavor, the blues roots and sound are all there, even with the \\"new\\" sound that includes are more technological spin on his music. He doesn't just make the computer sounds work - he makes them awesome in the songs that they're present. Some songs are just forceful (in a good way) like Quiver Syndrome and Riot in My House, while others like Harborview Hospital and especially Bleeding Muddy Water are more bluesy and eclectic than I would have ever imagined. I've gotten more bang for my buck from this album than I would have ever expected and it now sits as one of the best albums to really diversify your album collection, especially if it's mainly rock based (Led Zeppelin, Sabbath, Queens of the Stone Age, AC/DC, etc...) like mine. Not a bad song on the album gives the listener a trip through many different musical styles as done through Lanegan's prodigious style and voice.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Evangelion fans have a very tragic experience following a series that has had its epic highs, and epic lows. Without spoliling the ending, if you're a fan of Eva on any level, it is well worth watching this one through to the end (before and after credits).<br /><br />But, if you're not an Eva fan, Eva 1.11 and 2.22 represent the latest iteration of one of the greatest series of all time. This is the Star Wars of Japan, and truly deserves an equal footing of international recognition. If you haven't watched Eva yet, it's time to start. While watching the TV series (and 1990s movies) is strongly recommended, it's far from essential.<br /><br />The Rebuild of Evangelion was designed for a broader audience, and Eva 2.22 runs with that concept in jaw-dropping excellence. While some scenes are dripping in computer generation, Eva 2.22 stays true to its hand-drawn roots. Stop reading this review, go buy it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Kyle has done a great job personalizing the book with his stories.  Additionally, his thumbnail description of the weapons he used and encountered are very interesting!  Kyle does a great job at describing the life of a warrior; it is an interesting read, you won't be disappointed!
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|The Rebuild of Evangelion kicks off with this movie, the first of a four-movie epic that is still in the making.<br /><br />To be clear, you don't need to see a single thing of Eva to be comfortable watching this movie. But, fans of the movie won't be left with another Death & Rebirth. The first Evangelion movie was a bit of a snore-fest for fans, as it was basically a compilation of scenes from all the past TV episodes of the series, leading up to the final movie and episodes 25-26.<br /><br />Instead, Eva 1.11 represents a retelling of the series that will both welcome new fans, and leave old fans scratching their heads.<br /><br />Part of the mystique around Eva 1.0/1.11 (1.11 is simply 1.0 with some minor improvements, you're watching Eva 1.0 if you get this movie), is the lingering question of what Eva 1.0 represents.<br /><br />It is difficult to answer the question of if Eva 1.0 is a remake or not, even watching the movie completely through. Bottom line, if you enjoyed Eva in the 1990s, you will enjoy Eva 1.11. It isn't simply 1990s footage rendered/upscaled in HD. The movie has been hand-crafted for viewing in theaters, and the light use of computer generated animation only benefits the all-new, all-HD hand-drawn scenes.<br /><br />But please, watch it in Japanese with English Subtitles. It's the only proper way to enjoy Eva (and I'm saying that as a fan of the English dubbed voice actors).

B0093H8H8I|5.0|If you're looking for a budget CPU with Intel's HD 4000 graphics, stop here. No, seriously. This is Intel's only Core i3 processor for desktops with the HD 4000 GPU integrated onto the chip. All other third-generation Core i3 GPUs utilize a shader-reduced variant of the HD 4000 that won't cut it for gaming.<br /><br />Edit: Since this review, the i3-3245 has launched which also has the HD 4000 onboard, the i3-3245 is effectively the successor to the i3-3225 for the budget audience looking for an HD 4000. While I haven't used the i3-3245, I expect it handles very similarly.<br /><br />Now, some of you may shudder to think of the HD 4000 being used for gaming, but it actually can handle very well. If you're on a budget, and can't afford a great GPU just yet, the HD 4000 can play games like Half-Life 2 and Doom 3 without problem. No, it can't play the latest-and-greatest flawlessly, but it will do 1080P H.264 video without overheating your room, or your electricity bill.<br /><br />Not to mention, as a CPU, the Core i3 delivers excellence that puts down AMD's latest Fusion class of CPUs. While Fusion may deliver better GPUs, you're probably going to buy a GPU anyways at some point, which makes Fusion's GPU useless in comparison.<br /><br />Also, for HTPC systems, often times, you don't want an amazing GPU. You've got an Xbox 360 or PS3 for that. Enjoy playing all the games that your Xbox can't run, and get great low-heat CPU capabilities at the same time.
0393338398|5.0|I came across this little gem of a book simply because our Direct TV provider offered a limited availability to certain premium movie channels that were then showcasing the excellent movie, starring Brad Pitt, that was based on this book.  Watching snippets of the movie I became intrigued by some of the ideas presented therein and felt compelled to pick up the book.  And I'm very glad I did.  The book is excellent.  You'll probably enjoy it whether you're a baseball fan, or simply a curious individual.<br /><br />Michael Lewis wrote this book because he became intrigued with a simple question:  How did the Oakland A's, one of the poorest franchises in baseball, win so many games?  Michael's book then becomes a journey through the fascinating world of the business of baseball.  Lewis illustrates clearly and convincingly that much of the received \\"wisdom\\" that dominated baseball economics for so long is simply foolish.  Take, for example, the fact that baseball scouts have traditionally favored the best athletes over the baseball players who performed the most effectively at each previous level of play.  Billy Beane, Oakland A's General Manager and the central character in this book, is the prime example of this.  Beane was an amazing high school athlete who was signed straight out of high school by the New York Mets.  However, he never really became an outstanding major league baseball player.  Nonetheless, Beane was smart enough to understand that his career illustrated the muddled thinking of the traditional baseball scout.<br /><br />There is, I think, much to be learned from this excellent book by Michael Lewis, irrespective of whether the reader is a baseball fan, or not.  In fact, the very idea of challenging received wisdom and seeking to determine true causes and effects of success of any endeavor applies equally well to any enterprise.  In fact, on reflecting on this wonderful text, I am frequently reminded of that old classic, \\"Strategy in Poker, Business, and War.\\"  To put it another way, and quoting dearly departed Brother Francis Maluf:<br /><br />\\"Wisdom is the most perfect knowledge of the most important truths, in the right order of emphasis, accompanied by a total, permanent commitment to live accordingly.\\"<br /><br />We need to seek this level of wisdom in whatever we do.  Michael Lewis conveys this very important thought in a book dedicated to baseball.  But, in so doing, he also teaches us a great deal about life.  I heartily recommend this excellent book.  God bless.and War.\\"  To put it another way, and quoting dearly departed Brother Francis Maluf:<br /><br />\\"Wisdom is the most perfect knowledge of the most important truths, in the right order of emphasis, accompanied by a total, permanent commitment to live accordingly.\\"<br /><br />We need to seek this level of wisdom in whatever we do.

0440178002|5.0|This novel of over a 1000 pages is the first in a series of Asian sagas by John Clavell. It was Clavells' first novel, & in my opinion his best. Since I read it 50 years ago, I've read it two more times. It takes place in Japan, when a Dutch ship runs aground at a village, where the heros of our story, Blackthorne & Toronaga have an unforgettable relationship. There is a terrific love story, religious conflict, mostly to do with the Jesuit priests who are trying to convert as many Japanese to Catholicism as possible.<br /><br />I promise you that once you get into this great novel, you won't be able to put it down until you've finished it.<br /><br />The movie version of it is disappointing; Richard Chamberlain is a terrible actor to plsy Blackthorne, but Toshiro Mifune does a creditable job as Lord Toronaga.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|Am a big fan of Jo Nesbo, but Phantom disappointed.<br />It just seemed to go on too long, and the many names were<br />hard to keep track of , like a Russian novel.  Ok, but not as<br />great as his others.

B008UFUOH6|4.0|She is my favorite singer, hands down,and I buy anything that she involves herself in.  I have to admit though, I was a little leery of what her \\"Christmas Album\\" would be like.  I knew it would have her beautiful vocals on it, but other than that, I wasn't sure whether I would really enjoy it.  But now that I have it, I do!  It's extremely unique in that is isn't the same old mix of Christmas classics that you hear all season long in every store you step into. This collection is cool, crisp, light, and just beautiful.  And Tracey is fantastic as always.<br /><br />If you are looking for a relaxing and lovely change of pace from your normal Christmas albums to help get to you in the mood of the season, this is a wonderful album to buy.

0307592731|5.0|I was initially quite hesitant about reading this book. I am a college student and I don't read a lot for fun, but I wanted a good book to be able to relax with during finals week. Here were a couple things I was worried about regarding this book:<br /><br />1. That it would be too sad. I have struggled with depression on and off over the past year and I wanted to read something happy.<br /><br />2. That it would be too deep. Again, because of the depression, I didn't want to read something that would confuse me further about my own life and overwhelm me emotionally.<br /><br />I took the risk and read this book, and I could not be happier about how it turned out. Although Cheryl does discuss grief, it is not the main focus of the book, and I simply skimmed a few pages that I felt would be too sad for me. Cheryl is introspective, but I rarely felt bogged down by her reflections. At the end, I found myself thinking about my own life, but not in a stressed-out \\"I just finished reading a memoir and I need to change everything about my life\\" kind of way. I felt inspired, like I could do anything - including the finals week I'm currently struggling through :) I'd been worried that upon finishing, I would feel as if I had to drop my whole life and do something reckless and huge like hiking the PCT in order to make my life make sense or have any significance. This is one of the reasons why I haven't read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" But I don't feel that way at all after having read \\"Wild.\\"<br /><br />It was a real page-turner, fun and easy for me to get through even though I rarely read for fun and I sometimes have trouble getting through books. I read it in only about 2 or 3 days. I thought I might dislike the book because of Cheryl's (admitted) lack of preparedness for the trail, frequent use of swear words (not that I'm against that, I just thought it might get annoying after a while), and tendencies towards men, but I found her to be a very real, likable character whose emotionsI could somehow relate to even though we are two very different people.<br /><br />I do enjoy nature (I hike short distances for fun myself, and now I want to hike the PCT! :) and memoirs as well. Something that was interesting was Cheryl's discussions of how being a woman impacted her PCT experience. As a budding feminist and someone who is interested in gender and women's studies, I felt like this was very significant and validated my thoughts about how things are still not good for women in the U.S. in some ways.<br /><br />Overall, I really, really enjoyed this book even though I wasn't sure if I was going to. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fast-paced, interesting read.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Obviously must have for fans of the comics Zombie-ists everywhere, this series is more than just blood and guts. This show digs into the nuances of what would really happen in a Zombie apocalypse. The writing is aces and the actors, for the most part, really make you believe that each breath could be their last. No one is (really) safe, as the subtle twists that diverge from the source material really keep fans on the edge of their seats. Not to mention, this is one of the only shows that many of my family and coworkers all have a vested interest in, so there is much conversing to be had after each senses wringing episode. SIX stars out of five.
B0002WYTXK|5.0|We ordered this because my mother and step father evidently seen it some years ago and really wanted it so purchased it for them.  Great movie.
B007MDB548|3.0|I wanted a Blu-ray disc. They now only sell Blu-ray packaged with DVD or more discs. I couldn't even find a two-disc set, so I ended up ordering this stupid four-disc with 3D, which I can't even use and digital, which I won't use. After I sent my order to amazon.com I found the two-disc at Target for almost half the price. I am also disgusted that all the animated shorts for Disney Fairies shown on the Disney Channel are not included on this disc. What are they saving them for? The direct to DVD movies continue to get shorter (this is about 10 minutes shorter than the first one) so you get less for your money, too. They used to show the films on the Disney Channel a week after the DVDs came out. I finally checked before buying this one, but nothing was listed for two weeks, so I went ahead and bought it. Then, of course, they aired it about three weeks after releasing it on disc. There should be more (and better) extras for the price, too. On the plus side, the story is pleasant and the animation is beautifully done. I just wish you would get more for the price!
B004SBULWE|3.0|Love this app on my phone, but it doesn't seem to do much of anything on my kindle. Deleted it a while back.
0061726834|5.0|I don't normally write reviews however I will for this book.  I found the book to be such an easy quick read because the story line was good.  There are many different books I have found that have similar story lines, but somehow I gravitated to this book.  I will most likely read the others and compare.  This book reels you in from the beginning with the main character.  I would have loved to see more of her utopian life to bond with her family characters a little more as well as having a more developed relationship with Alex would have been great.  But overall it does a good job at allowing you incite into the main characters at the time.  I found this book hard to put down so it made it a very fast read.  Also the ending was so riveting that I immediately purchased the second book so I could find out what was going to happen next.  It has love, action and suspense all together in this book and it is just a fun read.  Not complex or hard to follow or understand, but defintitely entertaining.  If you like Hunger Games you will like this book.  This has caused me to get back into my reading mode which I have been out of for some time.  Thanks for the great read.  I recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Very addictive and sometimes aggravating game. Many an hour wasted playing this. I missed my little sisters guitar recital because of those darn egg stealing pigs.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Fair pricing, Fair delivery charges, quick shipping, accurate descriptions of products and good products delivered.Met all expectations. Thank you so much.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I downloaded this to cheat at words with friends. It works great for that. Highly recommended if you need help spelling to win.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Fair pricing, Fair delivery charges, quick shipping, accurate descriptions of products and good products delivered.Met all expectations. Thank you so much.
B00A77II0U|5.0|The graphics are great the story kept me involved. I have played plenty of hide and seek games and this by far ranks at the top. Some of the other games are so tough you get lost in the game and some too easy you get board. This was fun!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I rarely make it through an entire puzzle game without getting bored, but I enjoyed this.  I wish it had more levels.
B002SYXCVK|4.0|This album has more of a winter feel to it than a Christmas vibe.  There are some songs that are specifically written with a Christmas theme, but it definitely feels less limiting than a typical holiday album.  It's also rather transporting and makes you want to curl up in front of the fire with some hot chocolate (or rum) and be with your loved ones.
B0060D123K|1.0|It cuts out the &#34;Love is Gone' song, where Scrooge's fiancee sings to him.  I realize there was controversy surrounding that song when it initially released, but that was forever ago and most digital editions and DVD releases nowadays have that part.  Worst of all, it doesn't say anything about it in the description.  Boo Amazon :(
0062082353|5.0|Language a little raw at times, but understandable considering the author.  Great view into the life of a person who did what few people ever do in their lifetime, i.e., become a military sniper.
1439153663|4.0|I loved this book.  I fell in love with the characters and felt along the way that I was a part of the story, with all the stress, joys, heartbreaks involved.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the writing does get a bit repetitive, with details of who's taking care of whose child, who's pregnant again, who's the father of whose baby, etc.  That got a bit old, but otherwise, a truly beautiful story where you are cheering wholeheartedly for the good guys and want to see the bad guys go down.  It was a slower start, but once I hit the halfway point, I couldn't put it down and read late into the night.  Highly recommend.
015206057X|5.0|I gave this to my hairdresser when her daughter was born.  Not only did it become a favorite of her daughter  but my hairdresser has now given a copy of this book to all her friends expecting babies.
B009ZE27US|1.0|this app is ssssooooo stupid!!!  it don't even say your real age!!!! I would think it would say an. age around you but it dont
B004QK5N5W|5.0|it very good and it is in very good quality and very good shape and the package's is very good
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Wow!!! This is one of my favorite movies of all time. High caliber cast, interwoven story lines, Hugh Grant as Prime Minister. Just love it. You will not be disappointed. I watch this every Christmas.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I think this book does a good job of building tension, unfolding the characters and their (often twisted) motivations to a climax - and then delivers what seem to me a cope-out ending - with little resolution.  If you want to study how to build tension and plot you can see it done very well here - just don't be surprised if it doesn't deliver up to expectations.
B005LAII62|2.0|I bought this movie in time for halloween for 3 boys (ages 6-8) to watch. Being that it's a cartoon, I figured it would be a little scary, but more of a fun scary and age appropriate. I was wrong. There were some bad words (not a lot, but surprising for a cartoon nonetheless). Very scary with the zombies and dark material...all three boys were on top of me begging to turn it off. I should have rented rather than purchased.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was an amazing book from the start. If you love romance books you will LOVE this one. I recommend thus book if you especially liked the Fifty Shades trilogy!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game but there is no chalange. does anyone else see any chalange? cause I don't. its ok.
0920668372|5.0|I purchased this book for my granddaughter and son, 2 years ago he lost a 2 yr old daughter, when I seen this book and read a few pages it was amazing how alike it was to what the 2 year old had got up to it was like it was referring to her short little life her, parents then split up and it has been hard for both the oldest who is 6 and for my son, so I bought it for them when he read it to his daughter that night I got a real kick out of hearing the 6 yr old giggling from her room.  thankyou for bringing such a wonderful book into our lives at a time when we needed it. it will be 2 years since the death of Cecilia on the 21st of December.
B004LWZW9C|3.0|I am a sucker for this type of movie. One of my favorite movies is Love Actually, followed by Valentine's Day. I love having multiple story lines woven together. I happened to be in Time Square New York City in May 2011 when this movie was being filmed and I was so excited. I could not wait to see it. I never made it to the cinema to see it and tried to rent it as soon as it was released. Every time I went to Redbox it was sold out so I kept thinking this must be a great movie. I finally sat down to watch this movie last night and I was so disappointed. The story lines were not strong and so it was hard to connect with any of the characters. There was so much potential for this movie with the high caliber all star cast but none of the acting made up for the inadequate story line.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|Has a lot of useful conversion tools in it.  This is one of those tools that gathers dust until you really need it. It's a must for people that work in a technical environment and needs to from time to time make a conversion that is not in the norm of daily work.
034580404X|2.0|I was so underwhelmed by this series. The writing was poor and the plot was boring. I understand that many women read it strictly for the sex scenes but it was just uninteresting to me. Christian Grey's character is controlling in a way that, to me, was inappropriate and I hope that young women don't think this is how real relationships work.
B00A2IUHM6|2.0|Seriously Seth? I didn't expect much from this movie but wow! It's just awful. Making a teddy bear smoke a bong and drop an f-bomb every other word is not worth more than one laugh. I give this movie two stars. One for Mila and one for Patrick Stewart. The rest of the movie is an insult to anyone with an IQ over 60.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is more difficult than the same app on ipod touch. I still haven't gotten past one suit but I'm ok with that. Good way to unwind my brain at night.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I love this book. Wonderfully written. Deep insights. I highly recommend this book. I love all of Eckhart Tolle's book.
0385535147|4.0|Entertaining book...lots of who dun its...concludes rather quickly, but a good book to take you out of your everyday life and into a bit of a riddle...
B007VUA7VO|1.0|any app that runs constantly in the background can not save your battery.  Yes, it does tell you what is running but you can see that in your task manager.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Reliable! I love the gradual volume increase. It's like someone is nudging you gently to wake you up. I also like the option of doing math problems to turn the alarm off,  it helped me to stay awake and not hit snooze.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a great read! Very addictive I read all 3 books in the matter of a week.  I would recommend all to read.  Even my husband read it.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|We love Sylvester Stallone in all movies, great action, alot of hype talk, some funny stuff, All of the actors in this movie did their job well. very enjoyable movie
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite comedies! It's stupid humor, so if that's what you like, GO FOR IT!
B005HI4LLY|4.0|Not for children. Don't watch the trailer as it gives away too many of the scenes.<br /><br />As long as you view this for what it is -  a comedy -  and are not offended by fake blood spurting everywhere, it is throurghouly enjoyable. It does get a little long at the end.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|If you like chess, this is your app.  Play alone or with a friend. It also works great on a tablet.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|The controls are good but you have to get used to how hard and when to click the arrows to get exactly where you want to go which is challenging because the little guy is always jumping and you have to stay out of the way of obstacles. It really is a well put together game, good story, cute graphics, music that goes well with the game that you can turn off.<br />I thought this was going to be another jumping game (which I like) but it's not because you don't tilt the screen &amp; you don't only go up. You're supposed to beat the levels with a certain amount of jumps, get all of the jewels &amp; for the last thing I can't say what it it's because the only tinge I got it was in the first level! I think it's very challenging &amp; can't play for too long without getting annoyed but it is a good game &amp;I think I just need more practice with the controls. I keep wanting to hit a button to shoot the bad guys lol.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|App won't show entire news feed. Displays about 12 or so post from friends. I am really disappointed in this app being that I use it so frequently.
B007SG9L5E|5.0|I love this movie.  It is perfect for kids of all ages.  It is a great sequel to Kung Fu Panda.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I like this app because it lets me share my creativity with family and friends<br />If u want a picture to your own design get this app<br />Especially for &quot;homemade &quot; pictures so GET THIS APP<br />the only thing I don't like is that they need to get more backgrounds
B000F2C87Q|5.0|Great bluesy album from one of my favorite bands ever. I'm pretty sure that The Black Keys crap gold. Seriously.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|this is your app.  At times, it can be buggy, but it has enough games to keep even me happy and I play Sudoku daily. Often several times a day.  One thing I would love to see added to the game is the &#34;auto fill in&#34; feature. What I mean, is that when you are down to just one number, why should you have to take the extra time to enter them?  I wrote the developer about this and he replied saying that would take away from the game.. I disagree..  Like in solitaire, once the game is  obviously won, why should you need to do the obvious. At the least, this should be an option that can be turned on or off at the user's desire. I think &#34;hints&#34; take away from the game as this is &#34;cheating&#34; to me, but it's in the game. So, with that off my chest, this is a great game and well worth the effort.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|At the time of this writing, I've been using this app on my 10inch zeki for a few weeks.  This is the third battery saver/monitor that I've tried, but the only one I've kept for more than a few days.  It serves my purposes well, is fairly inobtrusive, and the only hit to system resources I've noticed is when it auto launches when I plug the tablet in, but even that is no more than loading any other app.  Also, unlke some other apps that claim to be free versions and then die when the trial ends (I have nothing against trial-ware, but would rather know at install), the free version works fine, but I'll probably still end up paying for the upgrade just to support the devs on this one.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|i couldn't stop playing I was glued to it when you start playing you can't stop but don't take my word for it see for your self :)
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|My sister loved receiving this as her birthday gift. Perfect condition, still in wrapper. Now I just need to steal it from her...
0757307272|5.0|I read the Success Principles for adults every day. My daughter is very motivated, but sometimes hearing things from me falls on deaf ears (teenagers!). This book is well laid out, with stories and points (to be successful) that are geared for the teen reader. I asked my daughter to read at least two pages every day. I think she is still doing this, and I know that her life will be transformed if she follows the principles. This is a great investment, and I received this book quickly. I am very pleased with this book, and with this purchase.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I really like the way this looks and functions, but it is not very durable. One of the corners broke off a week after I started using it.
B0042816YK|5.0|This girl can write. She has an amazing alliance with words that deeply convey her meaning. Her story is very relateable. She starts in a very difficult place and finds her way step by step to liberation and happiness as we all can. It's a fun and easy read. The book is way better than the movie, which makes me wonder how the author felt about the movie
0679720200|5.0|I read this book in one night. I can't recall the last time I did that.<br /><br />I consider this book a meaningful read. There is so much to it.<br /><br />A great read that I don't hesitate to recommend.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty good selection of games to occupy spare time. Some games are a little...stupid. But other than that, I'd recommend it to others.
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|Take a great show like Dexter and make John Lithgow his serial killer nemesis of the season. Need I say more?
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I bought this for my fiancé for our anniversary bcuz it is her favorite movie ever. It arrived on time and looks perfect.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Excellent book!. Can't wait to read the sequels to see what happens to the characters. Very well written, captivating scenery, and well developed characters.
1609611543|4.0|Book arrived in perfect condition.  Was reasonably easy to read, presented startling ideas and proposed excellent and easy to follow solutions.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|looooove Rod Stewart but this cd didn't really put me in a christmas mood. I was hoping for more songs as well
B0041KVW2K|5.0|First of all, thanks to my loving wife for gifting this box set to me.  She knew I wanted it in the worst way, and she made it happen.  Thanks, honey!<br /><br />Now...on to the product.  First, the book.  Ummm....WOW!  This book is absolutely beautiful.  The photos are amazing, and to say it is lavishly produced is an understatement.  Lots of great info in it, and it's an absolute joy to look through.<br /><br />Now...The records.  I consider myself a \\"Blue Collar Audiophile\\".  Yeah, I am a guy with champagne taste and a beer budget.  However, I still have a very nice Denon receiver, Music Hall Turntable, and a nice pair of Martin Logan speakers.  So I'm not exactly \\"slummin' it\\" if you know what I mean.  I expected great sound from this set.  Some of you on here are dissatisfied, and I honestly don't get it.  The sound of this set EXCEEDED my expectations by a country mile.  Personally, I am blown away.  To say I have enjoyed this box is the understatement of the year!  For those of you so unhappy with this set, you gotta remember - this stuff was not recorded last week.  We're talkin' mostly 1960's here...so get it in perspective and let your spoiled ears take this in in a different light.  All the rediculously polished pop records of today have ruined music.  if you need something spit-polished to absolute perfection, then go somewhere else.  This music is REAL music made by REAL human beings whose talent outran the machinery.  These days, the machinery outruns the talent - and of course you get inferior product.  As another reviewer stated, \\"knitpickers need not apply\\".  I applaud you sir.<br /><br />All of my records sound clean, dead quiet, and amazing.  The early albums have a crispness about them that's unreal.  the later records shimmer with the best production values that the times had to offer.  I am 100% satisfied with this purchase, and it is one of the highlights of my still ever-swelling record collection.<br /><br />Parents, be good to your childrenand buy this and play it for them.  Get them good and educated about what pop music is supposed to sound like.<br /><br />Again, thanks, honey!
B00915G6YE|5.0|I loved the first four seasons but the fifth and sixth seasons, especially six, were sub par at best. It lost so much of it's edge and originality that made this show so special. But season seven has just saved it. I heard that eight might be the last, if so I will be saddened. The season actually has about 4 major plot lines. The first is Debra's realization of Dexter's alter ego, The Bay Harbor Butcher and how she must deal with and eventually accept it. Especially since she just discovered she's in love with him. The second is Isaak, a Ukrainian mob boss whose gay lover just happened to land on Dexter's table, enter serial killer #1. The third plot line is Hanna, a poisoner who becomes Dexter's first true love. And the final major plot is LaGuerta putting the pieces together and too realizing that Dexter's the real Butcher not Doakes. I just finished the last episode and the final five minutes kept me on my toes. When she pulled the trigger, I damn near fell out of of my chair. This is what the die-hard viewers have been looking forward to for three years. I would suggest you go for the Blu-ray. Great television deserves to be seen in the best possible way and this show is definitely worth it.
1416594795|5.0|This book makes the case for evolution in a way that it entertaining, informative, with magnificent photos that elegantly make the author's points.  Superb and highly recommended!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a great book! I can't wait for the sequel to come out so that I can read it too. Would highly recommend.
B00A12VW86|5.0|With Green Day releasing three albums over the course of a few months, the obvious concern is whether they have the material to support the effort.  Having heard the first two, the answer is a resounding, &#34;yes.&#34;  If you like Green Day, you will love these albums.  A very strong effort.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was raw and as real as you can get. I loved each character as if they were my friends. This will be a book I read an endless amount of times.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Excellent product!! The serie and the packaging are perfect!<br />I´m very happy with my purchase. I live in Argentina and i can´t buy this product in my country.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|In my opinion this was one of the best Sting concerts I have ever seen. The next best thing to being there!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This CD isn't entirely Country and it's true that Taylor has moved away from that genre but I still honestly love this CD. The songs are catchy and well written.
B003UESJF6|5.0|You often meet Megaminds in your journey through life, some are funny, some are not, and some leave you scratching your head. BUT this one is wickedly funny and a good laugh for the whole family. I can't say I knew much about Will Farrell before, having lived in a cave, but he is a very funny and very sympathetic alien in this movie, which sends up almost the whole superhero genre at one shot....<br />Worth the buy or the rent, a hoot!
B001FD5KJM|1.0|great movie but you can't watch it unless you own a kindle fire!<br />i cant use it for anything not my Ipod, or the crapy ultraviolet.  ultraviolet sucks too its streaming only and you need to open 3 accounts to get started.
0451209338|5.0|This is for my 19 yr old son who loves political thrillers. I hope he loves this and completes the series.

031603441X|5.0|You would not think that his would be the most clear of reminisces, but Mr. Richards surprises with his detail for memories and his overall endearing nature.  A must read for Stones fans and rock and roll fans in general.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|After seeing seasons one and two, my girlfriend and I could not wait for season three. We soon discovered they are available on amazon for a great price, next thing you know we are watching the new episodes weekly. Cant wait til the second half of the season starts.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you love Star Wars then you are probably looking for this DVD Movie Set. A true must have for star Wars fans! I was shopping for this as a holiday gift for my son who wanted it this year. Overall the boxing of the product and the look is wonderful. But what I really loved as a shopper here at Amazon was the price they offered it for. You guys here at Amazon for a brand new set beat the heck out of the low price major department stores this year! Thank You!
B004XW6AGO|4.0|This book is long.  While other reviewers have cited this as a negative, I thought it was wonderful.  Murakami weaves an intricately magical world in the nearly 1000 pages of this novel.  The longer the book, the longer you, as reader, get to live inside that world.  You become fully immersed in the quirky, fantasical world Murakami creates and you get to know it like you live there too.  It took me about two months of bedside table reading to get through this tome, but every night I would pull up my covers and open the door back to 1Q84.  Is it slow at parts? Sure, but life is slow at parts.  If you just revel in being there, in being taken on the journey that the book provides, the slowness is more akin to strolling through a beautiful garden- something meant to be done slowly and with intent.  If you just want to go for a jog through a garden, missing out on the scent of the flowers and the ducks  in the pond, look for another read.  This one is meant to be savoured.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie follows the book very well. It keeps your attention the whole time. It has a little bit of everything for everyone.
0316069434|1.0|As with most of the reviewers here, I anticipate the release of a new novel from Mr. Connelly. I will say that the anticipation for the Black Box was wasted as this was undoubtedly his worst effort.  I am not even sure if he wrote this as there were so many uncharacteristically under-developed plot lines, or angles started and not finished.  Did you subcontract this out to production writers and put your name on it??<br />The over-arching plot thins as the pages turn, leaving it pretty easy to figure out where things are going before the conclusion.  The closing just seemed an exercise in trying to tie up as many lose strings as possible in a pretty badly constructed and unbelievable finale.<br />In short, if you haven't read it yet, take a pass and save the money- hopefully the next adventure is more worthy of the price.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This was a great deal for Black Friday. It arrived quickly and will fit nicely into the movie basket present I am preparing from it.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Downloaded this free app on my Kindle Fire (1st Gen.) and iPhone 4. Works great, information rich. They even have a nice holiday greeting.
0345803493|5.0|Very good book. It met the high expectations set by the first book.  Havent begun to read the 3rd one yet but I am excited to start it.
0817439390|5.0|Easy to follow, nice tips and great for people who are or trying to understand photography from beginners to professionals.
B009JBZH54|3.0|I still can't get over the lack of behind the scenes footage. Really lacking in that department. I mean, it's a plus cause you have all three movies. I would wait though.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great. ...... ... ....... ......... .... ...... ... ... .... ... ..... A+ + + + + + + + +
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I loved the show and wish it had run longer then it did! The two main stars are both good looking and I found the wizard refreshing.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Great guaility all around. It is,of course, a great movie that they cannot seem to make anymore. Maybe it is the lack of actors.
B000SW2F80|3.0|I watched this after not seeing it for probably 30 years, when I was about 10. Of course, not as good as then, nor scary at all, and very campy. From a nostalgia perspective, good to watch. Certainly not really scary.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|came fast and it was just what I wanted.  Item as described in ad. no problems with the order would recommend
B0045HCJKS|4.0|Great movie!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I truly loved this series, and the length initially intimidated me, but it only made it better!!!  It is such a shame that Mr. Larsson is no longer with us because I certainly would look forward to other books written by him!  WOW!  Kept me on the edge of my seat.
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|After reading a few positive reviews on other sites, I rented the movie. Turned out to be a total waste of time.<br /><br />This movie looks cool but lacks of substance whatsoever. The plot is weak and unconvincing at all. Acting is fine.
0743270754|5.0|This author is intense, detailed and very, very interesting.  This is a wonderful book about perhaps our finest President. Thank you
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Won't be buying a flashlight any time soon. I use this for my dog walking around and it is heavy durable and I'm just hoping this thing will last for a long time cuz it's a great solid buy!
1423140605|5.0|It's fun to be a grownup reading kid books. The themes are timeless with up to date references. Good classical review as well.
B00632HWOG|1.0|It asks me to login over and over but doesn't open.  Basically, it's trash.  This is for the Kindle Fire app.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The packaging is amazing and the Blu-ray quality is to die for.  It's a wonderful addition the Alien collector's collection!
B00007J5VN|1.0|Sweet Charity with Shirley MacLaine:<br /><br />I ordered this in the DVD format because I had already seen it and wanted it for my collection.  I also saw the musical in Las Vegas in the 1960's with Juliet Prowse.  I liked the alternate ending on this DVD better than the original which was depressing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The basic concept of the game is to see how long you can keep the character alive. While trying to collect as many coins and equipment upgrades as possible. The in-game missions increase the overall difficulty level and force you to use different strategies in order to complete them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its hard to stop playing. App works great. Its nice to not have to have wifi to play this like some other games.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game has been so much fun so far...I just reached the part where you have to pay $2.99 to continue and I think it's. worth it!  You get to choose from 3 levels of game play difficultly depending upon your skill level (or laziness as the case may be LOL) . I liked the map idea so you always can find out where an action is needed to progress through the game but you don't have to open the map.  You can play purely by your own gut or the guts of the games' creators (gotta love an NCIS reference to prove what a geek I really am!!) This game is interesting and a bit spooky,  the mini games are unique although a tad on the easy side. G5 has given us another wonderful time suck and I for one am grateful!  5 stars!
B009G497L4|3.0|As fantastically great as Marvel's The Avengers is (and that is *very*!), I am seeing this product priced far higher than it has any right to be.  No one should ever pay more than about fifty bucks for a limited edition copy of a single movie.  I am seeing this priced almost forty dollars *higher* than that (or more!)!  If you want a truly collectible copy of this movie, look for the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One set.  It will be released April 2, 2013 and has ALL the Marvel movies that lead up to Avengers, and Avengers itself, with tons of extras, and an awesome suitcase with a glowing Tesseract!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0083SBMGW Marvel Cinematic Universe Assembled Collectors]]<br /><br />Avoid the Avengers this review is attached to if it is still overpriced.<br /><br />EDIT: 5/4/2013 - I have been informed in the comments that you can get this for $20 at Best Buy.  That is very much worth getting, and the movie is still amazing.  Please understand that my rating on this movie is only to serve as a warning for people not to spend too much on an otherwise phenomenally good movie.<br /><br />EDIT: 1/12/2014 - The price has dropped to a more reasonable (but still too-high) seventy dollars, so I'm upping the stars to 3.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Have not used yet.  But, I fully expect these to be good quality.  Bought as preparation need for backup batteries.  Will 'yell&#34; if they do not work when needed.  They have a couple of years until expiration...that I consider to be very adequate.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is the third and final book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  I enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as the first two.<br /><br />This one picks up shortly after the end of the second book, Catching Fire, which ended on quite a cliff-hanger.  Everything has broken loose and been turned upside down. It's no longer a matter of surviving the Capitol's Hunger Games.  It's a matter of surviving open warfare, and now everyone is at risk, not just the tributes in the arena.<br /><br />Yet with so much at stake, our hero Katniss mostly just fumbles around.  Yes, she's been a pawn before, and I suppose she knows she is still just a pawn, but she only breaks out from that on the rare occasion.  You'd think that by now she would be coming into her own.  So, for much of the book, I was kind of annoyed with her.  Towards the end, she does finally break out on her own - or at least, of her own volition - but ultimately she falls short of her goals, with others stepping in to do the heavy lifting.<br /><br />I was kind of disappointed by the ending.  It's not so much what happened as how it was revealed to us.  Again, Katniss has been sidelined as a pawn, and so much of what has happened is simply told to us as a fact.  There's very little dialog, and very little narrative of discovering what has happened and seeing Katniss' reaction.  Instead, we get a \\"this is where I am now\\" info-dump that is lacking in passion.  She does finally make some good, independent choices, but it wasn't enough to save the ending for me.<br /><br />The love triangle was resolved more or less the way I thought it would end, and that was at least satisfying.  So, it was a pretty good book, but I think it was a weak ending to the trilogy.
B008KE3960|4.0|Good game. Simple and easy to learn. There is some strategy required to earn enough coins to unlock the right aircraft.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I try to purchase a new Christmas cd every year and this one is great! Get's you in the Christmas Spirit! Enjoy
B009186JYI|5.0|This is a great documentary on the Stones. The fact that they've been playing together for 50 years & be able to look back on a slice of time from 1965 is amazing. I saw the Stones in the late 60's at the Hollywood Bowl when 'Satisfaction' was number 1.<br />  If you were around to experience the 60's or if you just want to take a look back at a great Rock 'n Roll band from the 20th Century, I highly recommend this piece of work! It is truly real!
B0079L2XTE|5.0|Of the best soundtracks of the year, like the movie, has very good music, you can hear all the time. Very good appearance of Earth Wind and Fire.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The iconic movie series that set standards for action/horror genres for decades to come.  Relive these great films in movie theater clarity.<br /><br />The only flaw is the slip cover case.  The back of the case information sheet fell off almost immediately.
0316069434|5.0|The Black Box holds the ultimate secret.<br />Michael Connelly is simply the best writer of crime thrillers today.  In his latest mystery, the Black Box, Harry Bosch is now the senior Detective in the LAPD Open-Unsolved Homicide Division.  Harry has been with the LAPD for a very long time and has reached retirement age, but through a little know retirement program-DROP (Deferred Retirement Option Plan)- Harry has opted to continue with the LAPD for another 5 years.  Due to his age and other personality issues, Harry is now the senior Detective in the Open-Unsolved homicide division where he can put his crime solving skills to best use trying to solve decades old unsolved homicides.<br />The Black Box involves an enigmatic murder that occurred on Bosch's detective watch during the chaotic and deadly 1992 Rodney King LA riots.  A beautiful Danish war correspondent is found savagely murder in an alley.  Unfortunately, there were many murders during the King riots and most went unsolved.  Still this particular murder has weighted on Bosch's fertile mind for over 20 years.  Now in his new job in the Open-Unsolved Homicide Division, Harry Bosch means to solve this nagging decades old crime.<br />Terrific crime procedural novel from Mr. Connelly as always.  Using ALL his deductive detective skills Bosch zeroes in on who killed the beautiful Danish war correspondent Anneke Jespersen.  This is a gripping educational read as the reader will learn how perceptive detectives use their skills, wiles, and deductive hunches to break the most difficult of crimes--the cold case.<br />No gratuitous sex, language or violence:  Michael Connelly trademarks.  Just excellent engrossing writing.<br />Character development was superb.  With every book we learn more and more about Harry Bosch the man and the detective:  Irascible yes, a good Dad yes, honest--to a fault.  Harry is the type of cop we want on the beat and on the job solving crime.<br />5+ star recommend.  Harry Bosch is to crimesolving, as Mitch Rapp is to killing bad clandestine operators, and vigilante Jack Reacher is to helping the little guy.  In the past 2 weeks I have read 5 terrific novels by Connelly, Baldacci, Grisham, Flynn, and Fury.  Each was outstanding in their own right.  We readers are lucky to have such a plethora of great contemporary writers of the mystery thriller genre today.  Connelly's The Black Box is a terrific anytime read.  Enjoy.

0062200909|4.0|Kind of disappointed in The Hobbit Chronicles art book. :( Don't get me wrong I think it is still worth getting. I just expected that there would be actual makeups for the hobbits and dwarf characters not just concepts. I was looking for on set photos as well.  Mind telling me why there are really no Orcs at all in the book?  Its is no Cabin in the Woods art book.

B009E3EYS8|5.0|I gave them 5 stars and you can tell they really took their time and master this digital set. On the DVD of the concert you can choose to go to each song. Do you want to hear &#34;stairway to heaven&#34;? No problem... go to the main menu and select it. Watch them rock out!
B00129H7VS|5.0|The title speaks for itself.<br /><br />This series depicts the superhuman efforts everyday normal people can do.<br /><br />Honor, Courage and country, they stood their ground and did not move.<br /><br />They shoved their fists in Hitler's face and defeated a superior force with just pure willpower.<br /><br />A great piece of history that should never be forgotton.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I have to admit, for a free book, it sounded like a great story and for the most part, it was.  There were aspects of \\"Waking Up Married\\", however, that just made it seem like a slow read at points.  Cute story, for sure.  I could have done without the mean girls...no one likes them, but it was still a good read.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|If you have Angry Birds Free Version, but you can't stand the annoyance of constant advertisements: This is the app for you.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the game (despite being one of the most popular apps in mobile techonolgy history) than you should definitely start off with the free version.<br /><br />If you're an avid player at this point, don't think twice about jumping for ad-free as it integrates a smoother gaming experience. Simply put, the absence of advertisements reduces &#34;lag&#34; and slowness while significantly improving the game-play.
B000R34V50|4.0|Product arrived on time at USPS, but USPS didn't give us a notification about its arrival. So it took couple of days until we check online and pick up the item at the local USPS. Happy with the purchase though. Gave 4 star rating due to item in good condition and I'm a turtle fan. Unfortunately, I would have given it additional star if we didn't have to go to the hassle of picking up the item.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I wish I would have read this book before my divorce. Amazingly enough I have learned so much about myself and the reasons why my marriage failed. This book along with the bible will not allow me to fail in the future. I recommend this book to everyone. Amazing read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I can see why its so much fun you never run out of things to do. Plus I love a sale!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|An excelent game, it is fun and challenging. Also it has a lot of extra content, like concert videos and explanations about the concept of personas. The network funcionality is nice and can take you out of troble.<br /><br />I really do recommed this game.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Ditto to all the other comments regarding the most recent update, I can only see the last 10 or so News feed postings on my beautiful Kindle screen.<br />I sure hope the developers are reading these posts and will actually do something about it!
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|This is an electronic version of air hockey for your phone or tablet.  I would recommended for large screen devices that will allow for 2-player modes or ample control space, but for smaller devices (older phones) the sensativity of the controls can get a little annoying.<br /><br />If you have the space on your screen to play, this is a great 1 or 2 player game to kill some time.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Not enough bonus features! The Raiders and Temple do not hold up to Blu ray but the other two do.
0316044695|5.0|Awesome book..so inspirational, patriotic and heroic. Truly one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life. This book compliments Seal of Honor and Lt Michael Murphy and SDVT 1 and their heroism and patriotism. God bless them all for their sacrifice to our beloved country.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a great bag, but I was disappointed to find the the size clips can't hold a tripod it can only fit a monopod and It can barely fit my laptop.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a great petite camera back the holds 2 DSLR bodies and few lens with room for your memory cards, portable hard drives, charger, cleaning supplies and a small flash bracket or V-glider and it can handle the rain and snow! (Just make sure you zip it up all the way).

B002Q9VPFM|5.0|The item i purchased was in great condition and shipped fast, my only complaint is with the movie itself. i am a huge fan of the novel and loved the movie but felt it missed out on too much. After watching the ultimate cut i decided most the elements left out were for good reason. The theatrical version or directors cut are better. Its kind of like the Star Wars Prequels, i wanted all the information but wasnt too happy after seeing it all on celluloid.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed this one. It wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be, but I really had a good time reading this one. Its well done and very interesting. and the photos are great!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I love this cd! It is one of my favorites that the Celtic Women have produced, the music video dvd is the only thing that would make this better!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|As many other reviewers have commented, Clancy's recent books have not lived up to the standards of his earlier work. In particular, the Jack Ryan , Jr books have always seemed rather flat to me - his character hasn't been that appealing, and the plots have not had the many facets and nuances that were present in the Jack Ryan, Sr series. With Threat Vector, I think Clancy has, for the most part, recaptured the magic of those earlier books. The complex threads of the plot were interesting and not completely obvious, and the characters, while still not great, were much more appealing than they have been recently. While not up to Clancy's pinnacle (Debt of Honor and Executive Orders, in my opinion) this was a good read that was hard to put down. I read the whole thing in about three days, including one session when I should have been sleeping, and really enjoyed it.<br /><br />If you like espionage / action books, you should find this a very worthwhile read.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|My kids love minecraft so I bought this for my two oldest boys. The box is very deceiving. There is 400 or so pieces in it but the box itself measures only 4.8 x 5.6 x 4.8 inches so it is very small. I am keeping it because like I said, my sons love the game so I know they will love this lego set too but save your money and buy them something else as the price is way too high for something so small.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Graphics and storyline are interesting.Mini games are pretty easy. Had download take a very long time on Kindle fire. Now having trouble unlocking the rest of the game.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|The Rolling Stones are one of my favorite, from their beginning. Lots of classic songs to rock to. A must for all Stones fanatics. Recommend it for all classic rock fans.

B00005214X|3.0|There was a reason George only got one or two songs per Beatles album!  Way way too much filler here for a triple disc album - just not enough quality songs to fill 2 albums yet alone 3!?!  One can start with the \\"jam\\" album which totally blows - and then many of the songs on the first two albums totally stink too - boring - zzzzzzzzzz.  Too bad because this would have been a killer single album.
B007PVHANM|5.0|It is so wonderful knowing all the history on Bob Marley it is a must have movie for wonderful information.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Love this movie and the story! It is not your average maiden in distress Snow White portrayal. This storyline is laced with darkness, good special effects and quite a few twists and surprises too. Kristen Stewart plays a great part as Snow White with purity and cunning alike. A great almost &#34;21st century-style&#34; depiction of a strong survivor; a woman with warrior skills inclusive! The evil queen is dramatized by the pure heinousness played so effectively by the beautiful Charlize Theron. The love story is there as well but more subtle. Production and visual effects are memorable. I didn't see it at the theater but watched the dvd movie two times in a row, and since then have watched it often for pure entertainment.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|My husband and I are 50 and 60 years old and we loved this movie! I can't imagine the kids not enjoying it. Incredibly funny and touching story. All families should watch! A+!
B007DJUO8O|3.0|Storm Corrosion is a side project featuring Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth & Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, this album is a eerie journey into the macabre and avant-garde side of music. If you like something to listen to in background or lay back with headphones and lead you through a eerie trip, then this album is for you.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I like the fact that the case is slim and light.  I liked the smaller pad and didn't want to add back on to it!  Great item.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Prometheus is a great show, for anyone who liked the alien series this will answer a few questions and provide you with some background into the history of the original.  Noomi Rapace does a great job with the range of emotions needed in this story.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I find the game really fun and challenging.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing these types of games and enjoys a challenge.  Darth Vader laughing if you don't make the level, forces you to push on until you do.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I have an acer a500 tablet and have had no problems at all so it works and that is what I wanted
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Who has NOT seen or heard of Downton Abbey?! you would have to live in a closet not to know about it! This show is incredible. Have seen a lot of the now stars in other British movies and now they are finally being recognized by this incredible series. Absolutely in LOVE with Downton!!! :)
B000JMKTLO|1.0|This author knows how to write but it would be good if she could find some non-disgusting characters to write about.  The only sympathy I felt for anyone in this book was for the mother pigs at the slaughterhouse.  Ghastly images that I wish I weren't going to remember for way too long!<br /><br />This is NOT really a murder mystery. There are too many unlikely events and the odds of two crazies in one house are just not that good.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Munch Time is not only cute, its also very addicting. The little chameleon guy is so cute! especially when he munches. Everything about this game is addicting. From the character to the music. Plus... what do you have to lose? It's free.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I was initially worried when I put my brand new Kindle in the case because it really wasn't clicking for me how it could sit in so easily and be safe.... but I was totally wrong! It holds the Kindle snuggly, looks great, and I love the swivel feature. By far my favorite ever Kindle case. It's very well thought through.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I can never set this game down! It's like a perfect mix of farmville and my little lobby combined! It's a must have!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|the best and prolly only good part was the fight between ted and wahlberg.  nice!  but i hav to agree with another commenter, it pretty much was family guy recycled gags, although i luved that potty mouth bear!  a bear after my own heart!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The Bible was great, especially the audible control on the app.  I would recommend this to someone that wants to complete the goal of reading the Bible it comes with doable plans for doing just that.

B007AJFSJW|5.0|as someone whose formal education is not connected with economics i found this book very clear and informative yet not speaking down to supplicants.
1451635672|5.0|I give this book a five star rating because it is one of the better books on the Stardust Hotel and the Chicago Outfit's operations there.  I worked at the Stardust as a craps dealer during the time this book takes place and can witness the accuracy of Mr. Pileggi's narration. I bought the book to use as a reference as I am currently writing a book myself about these times and events that I witnessed and found it (the book) engrossing and much better than the movie, although I thoroughly enjoyed the film and thought that De Nero nailed the character of Lefty Rosenthal.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I will say this.  If this review was based on the movie, I would give it four or five stars.  Because of the fact that this is one of the biggest Ultraviolet releases out there, I must make my feelings known.  I am not an unreasonable person, but Ultraviolet is making me that way.  First of all, everybody knows that this isn't supported by I-tunes.  I knew that beforehand.  However, if it played on my I-pod, all would be forgiven.  Well, that is not the case.  The version of I-pod touch I have is too outdated to download the app.  This is the process in a nutshell.  You have to subscribe to 2 services that being flixster and the other being ultraviolet.  Pretty tedious for just one movie.  They store it for you which essentially means that they own it and rent it to you.  In I-tunes, I own the product because it is essentially downloaded on my computer.  UV is in the cloud.  That's it.  No other options.  I'm starting to think that the backlash towards UV will essentially be it's downfall.  I believe that it was an experiment in the control of entertainment.  If they control it, they can essentially take your basic information and essentially make money by selling it to advertisers.  The only good that will come of this is that I know to never buy an ultraviolet copy as long as I am on this Earth.  That should save me money in the long run.
0780624890|4.0|Blade is a good movie but what made the movie more than anything was the main villian. Decon frost was one of the coolest and most original bad guys ever seen on film. Highly reccomend this movie!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My kids love this.  It gets them up in the morning which is a huge plus.  I would not call this an \\"Advent\\" calendar though...loosely tied to Christmas.  Also have to agree that it is way over priced even at $30.  May not be getting this next year.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Found it veryvuser friendly.  Both my 7yr old and I enjoy the different difficulty levels. Its easy enough that my 5yr old daughter is learning the pieces too!

B004SIP8OI|1.0|Heinous joke of a movie.  Wife rented it, I couldn't even watch it, could scarcely remain in the room.  Typical Tarantino trash.
B001NLYXOE|5.0|Son wanted to watch it at home before his teacher fast forwarded parts at school.  Now he has it on his home computer.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I could never understand why so many people thought this lame movie was funny in ANY sense of the word.This is one drug out, horrible,boring mess that is a total waste of time.Anybody who would find this humorous,would probally be drunk and/or stoned while viewing it.For everybody else...and this includes people who don't use liquer and weed to move foward in life,leave this crap-fest of a film alone,and go for a different comedy.
B00729M0GO|5.0|I'm a fan of Andre Rieu and have a number of his DVDs and CDs.  I like this CD very much, it shows his warm relationship with Sir Anthony Hopkins who impressed me the most by writing a very nice waltz.  I like the waltz, it really makes you feel like dancing. I'm more happy for him because this waltz was written well over 30 years ago.  How nice it is to finally hear your creation put to full orchestration.  The dvd is very nice.
B00451VH8E|3.0|Remembering how outstanding my experience seeing this in the theatre many years ago, I ordered it in Blue Ray expecting to duplicate or at least simulate the viewing experience on my own TV.  Were we disappointed to learn that in order to stretch it to the size of our larger screen, the wide version viewing we had hoped we'd get was merely paintings along the sides of the smaller screen to change them from black to boring and somewhat off-putting.  I realize it's our own fault for not investigating further, but it's a lesson learned that I am hoping to other clueless  blue ray owners.  My recommendation; dust off your old VHS copy and crank up the volume.  Better yet, close your eyes and remember.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|Great game except for there are only 4 people to choose from. I got bored doing the same people over and over.

1449433251|5.0|This is a HEAVY set!  Its very elegant and looks great on my bookshelf.  I look forward to sharing it with my kid when he's old enough to enjoy it!  I bought it for him
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|Probably one of the best Andre has done since I've come to know him.  He showcases a moving concert that will really touch your heart.  Introducing children from South Africa and his new soloist also from South Africa.  Quite an inspiring DVD but more so because I was present at this concert.
B002PNF8HK|4.0|The Silent Hill movie was released in the US 2006. It begins with a young girl named Sharon who is having terrifying nightmares. Her nightmares are of Silent Hill, so her mother Rose decides to take Sharon to the town in order to understand her dreams. In the town, Rose loses her daughter, encounters multiple deformed monsters, and fearful townspeople. It turns out Sharon is Alessa, a young girl who was burned as a sacrifice for the church. Or I should say, Sharon is Alessa's manifested innocence because the burned Alessa is consumed with hate. Her hate is projected as the darkness of the town, and the creepy creatures of the darkness are physical metaphors of Alessa's troubled psyche.<br /><br />Like Kentaro Muira's Berserk, Silent Hill doesn't rely on \\"boo\\" tactics to scare its audience. Instead the viewers are engulfed with a lonely, foggy atmosphere to lure his audience into uncertainty. The atmosphere is accompanied with the creatures like the dark nurses.<br /><br />The most nerve-racking moment of this movie is when Rose encounters the dark nurses. Words can't do this scene justice, so you'll have to view it for yourself.<br /><br />Silent Hill is one of the few horror films that has an intricate storyline. In my opinion, the Silent Hill movie is the best video game adaptation to date. With that said, there are two moments of the movie that troubled me: the \\"safety zone\\" and the ambiguous ending.<br /><br />Now the members of the religious order including Alessa's real mother are able to hide in a Church to avoid the terrifying effects of the town. Oddly enough, Alessa is not able to enter this Church, so she stores her spirit in Rose to get the revenge she craves. This leads me to believe that Alessa is evil, and the Church members are the victims. A fan of the series claims that she's not evil. It's just that the townspeople's will was stronger at the moment, and she was unable to break their will. So what is the message here? Those with more will are justified in their actions? What do you all think?<br /><br />Now the ending! There are many hypotheses to what happens to Rose and Alessa in the last scene. Some say they died. Some say Alessa finally has the mother she desires. Personally, I believe the ending is not a happy one. I think they're stuck in Silent Hill. They'll live the rest of their lives in isolation and haze because of Alessa's selfish desire to spend time with her new mother. But hey! That's just me.<br /><br />Regardless of how you view Alessa's character or the movie's conclusion, this horror movie stands out from the pack with it's haunting atmosphere and unique storyline.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I like Susan Boyle's music a lot. Each time I listen to the CD, I enjoy the songs more and more. Susan's voice always inspires me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Mindless fun if you want to waste time. Good if you want something to do to occupy your mind.<br />Good luck.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Not my usual kind of book but I could not put it down once I began reading. Highly enjoyable. Quite the cliff hanger. Hope they make it a movie. It will be a smashing success.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I like this cd very much, I certainly give credit to Susan Boyle on her musicanship.  She is more a pop singer but she brings an old standard style I like.  Beautiful orchestral arrangements, a great choral background yet simplified but nice.  Basically you get straight music with wonderful style.  I'm really impressed with her - her Christmas cd is very nice too although I'm not big on breathy tones which she gives throughout the cd.  However, she gives full voice on Standing Ovation and she showed her flexibility in singing in a duet.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Others have synopsized the plot better than I could, so I'll get right to the point of what really bothered me about the book:  the kidnapping of Nicole in France, and the premise that the child's father had kidnapped her first, so for the Americans to kidnap her and illegally remove her from the country was okay.  Especially since the father was a horrible father and a criminal.<br /><br />Sorry, but kidnapping a child--even if you believe that child is a family member--and falsifying a birth certificate, passport and visa for that child in order to remove her from the country is still a crime.  Maggie never knew the child's true circomstances; she simply believed whatever the two shady characters who \\"helped\\" her take the child (for a price) was the truth.  If fact, they lied to her throughout the book.  Nicole had been bought and sold as if she were livestock, and Maggie was a willing participant, soothing her conciense with the belief that her family could and would provide a better home. Maggie herself had no interest in or love for the child; she just wanted it because it had been her sister's child, and she could it as a gift to her parents.<br /><br />I don't know if I want to continue with this series, if Maggie is so willing to bend international laws to suit her own purpose, and to gamble with a child's life.  It leaves me with serious doubts about her own moral code.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|CUBISTRY is totally absorbing and addicting. Loved the futuristic concept and design. Great graphics and vibrant colours. A 'mother-ship' cube compromising of many smaller cubes of varying colours and patterns just appear to float in deep dark space. The 'mother' cube appears to be 3-dimensional, and is fully rotational at the swipe of a finger. The puzzle is so very simple to use, and very responsive to every touch and swipe. In puzzle mode, Cubistry is very relaxing and soothing; even to the point of being able to replace bubble-wrap as an anti-stress medium. In attack mode, be ready for a workout as a deluge of randomly generated cubes amass as you endeavor to match your responsiveness against the attacking cubes. This presently is my favourite puzzle game app' on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm looking forward to reading many more favourable reviews on CUBISTRY.

0446554995|4.0|This book is a slow starter, because it reviews a bit of previous book.  One feels very sorry for Helen Pendergast because, thanks to a lion and some bad guys, she not only loses a hand, she loses her life, and after she is buried someone comes along and digs her up again, taking her apart.  Pendergast, having found that she is alive and hoping to continue his life with her, is to be congratulated that he simply does not lose his mind, having viewed her in all these conditions.  His mental state throughout the book seems very much on the edge, both mentally and physically.  But he hangs in, gets to the myserious island where Helen has been taken and manages to kill a lot of people in his effort to find her - who he does find, taken apart. He also discovers that Helen had borne two sons to him; twins. They are very odd,  one, Alban, a young superman and the other, Tristam, a very gentle and likable fellow, who does seem to be getting himself together.  Alban vanishes and Tristam goes home with Pendergast - which will of course, lead to several other books from that prodigous duo, Preston and Child.<br />Linda Sheean

030746363X|1.0|I picked this up in a friends house and started to read because I had enjoyed 4 hour workweek. Was wading through it until I got to slow carb diet, and then I felt like crying. His recommendation is to eat a particular set of foods repetitively during the week and break with a cheat day. Then on cheat days, he loads up on chocolate bars etc until he feels slightly sick. Not for any great enjoyment, but more that he won't feel like more gluttony during week.  YUCK! That's borderline eating disorder in my mind. Lots of people all over the world love food, experiment with food and flavour, enjoy their food every day and are a normal weight.  Everyone knows that, but after reading that book, I just needed to say it.

This makes it difficult - I really feel impossible - to learn to position the sling for consistent shooting.  We have tried many time to play this game but ultimately gave up in extreme frustration.  Kids can't learn about angles, trajectories, physics, etc. with such lousy tools.

0439023513|4.0|The final installment (hopefully not) of the Hunger Games was an exciting read. However, it was definitely not the best book in the series. The beginning was a little slow and Collins spends a lot of time describing background stuff and then speeds through situations or character descriptions that left me wanting more information. All in all, enjoyable but I truly hope Collins decides to write another book in this series because I still have so many questions.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I was anxious to read this book because of the many and varied reviews but I have to say that I was a bit disappointed.  I didn't like either main character and felt that the book had an unsatisfying ending.  I know some readers like to feel unsettled at the ending of a book - like to let the book settle in for a long time after they've finished it.  Not me.  I didn't like that the persons involved didn't get what was coming to them.  I wanted a bit of justice and vindication but in the end, I was reading about two narcissistic (sp?) characters who got away with too much violence and psychological manipulation.<br /><br />I like a clever twist but the ending didn't make sense to me.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This film began somewhat unevenly for me. Bradley Cooper's acting was a bit over the top and uncomfortable to watch. I'm not sure the mental illness he exhibits would really be described as bipolar, it's mostly just manic, bordering on schizophrenic. He does manage to calm down somewhat as it progresses, and does well. He's just a bit out of his league here.<br />Robert DeNiro is great playing, well, a Robert DeNiro-type character. His acting simply speaks for itself. Overall, the ensemble performance was first rate.<br />What really set this one apart was Jennifer Lawrence. Her range and credibility continue to resonate.  In this story, she plays a character somewhat older than her 21 years, and you don't doubt it for a second. She has the eyes and presence of one who many would describe as an old soul. Been here, seen this before. A reviewer of one of her earlier films, while not liking the movie all that much, describes her as an exquisite creature, one that the camera loves.<br />Another review of Silver Linings described it as her best performance to date. While it is an amazing, versatile display (not to mention the dancing ability she shows and, well...that body. Yikes), the reviewer must not have seen \\"Winter's Bone\\". That movie blows me away every time I watch it.<br />Yes, the ending on Playbook was a bit over the top, but so what. It felt great.<br /><br />Without her, this one would probably have rated about 3 1/2 stars. With her, it's a  4 1/2 to 5. Hope she wins the Academy Award here she should have won earlier.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is the greatest and most used app on all of my devices, and has every right to be. It has a beautiful interface and an extremely large stockpile of translations, but it is missing something: the ability to view, collaborate, and contribute to and with your groups through the app. YouVersion sits with an amazing tool in their hands, but it just comes down to honing it. Once YouVersion masters this, the app will be priceless to me and many others.

1416955070|3.0|Okay, so I realize I'm a little late to the game on this book but since I'm fairly new to the YA genre I'm giving myself a free pass. Plus, the way I see it, my review is so much more relevant now thanks to its upcoming theatrical release, so I've got that going for me. I really didn't think much about The Mortal Instruments series, despite all of its accolades, until I saw the movie trailer. Wow. Demons? Tough hot guys? A supernatural realm hidden within ours? Tough hot guys? Just... wow. There is sooooo much potential! So naturally, I did what any self-respecting, mature adult would do---I immediately went out and bought the book and squealed like a hormone-addled teen. Yes, folks. I've learned that Ms. Cassandra Clare has the ability to render me into a giggly, wide-eyed mess. For the most part, the book lives up to its praise.<br /><br />I think the thing that really grabbed me with City of Bones was its rich world-building. I love the idea of a darker, separate realm hidden beneath the everyday mundane one that we all see. Clare didn't go overboard with  superfluous details and nonsensical explanations. The supernatural universe was woven deeply into our own in a very natural way, making the suspension of belief quite easy. She also touched on a little bit of everything--- demons, vampires, angels and werewolves, which I thought was really entertaining. I also really appreciated the complexity of the main characters. Each one of them was bold and strong yet still vulnerable in their own way and it's that vulnerability that makes you want to delve deeper. We really only scratch the surface in this book, especially with regard to Clary and Jace. I can't wait to learn more about them as the series continues. And there's another thing. Can we PLEASE just talk a minute about that WTF-induced Clary/Jace revelation!? Seriously!? Did Clare really just go there!? Anyway, another reason to check this book out--- the previously noted twist and  holy-mother-of-god action filled ending. So unexpectedly good!<br /><br />But despite how much I thoroughly enjoyed City of Bones, it did have its share of faults. For one, the pacing was all over the place. Much of the action occurs throughout the beginning and at the end. Honestly, there were several scenes in the middle that felt like they were thrown in there for the sake of having something happen. They didn't quite jive with flow of the rest of the book. And another thing that really got me was that it was a YA book that, at times, felt very YA. Sometimes Clare sucked me in and sometimes it was a little too teenage angsty for my liking. Regardless, I was engaged enough to want to continue on with the series and will definitely be waiting in line for the movie on opening night.<br /><br />Food for Thought: The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is an incredibly imaginative story with enigmatic characters and rich atmosphere. I guess my only reservations with this one are the uneven pacing and somewhat youthful writing style. It's clearly evident who the target audience should be (teens), enjoyable as it was. I do look forward to catching the movie adaptation with hopes that it'll be a bit more edgy than its bookish counterpart.illed ending.

B004SBQGHS|1.0|I really enjoy the Angry Birds game, and so I thought that I would help the developers (and myself) by purchasing the ad-free version.<br /><br />What they neglected to state is that it is NOT truly ad-free. There are ads for their in-app purchases (which increase from the free game), ads for the other angry birds games, and other ads for the angry birds franchise.<br /><br />The ads for the angry birds star wars version show up after what seems like every level, and to make matters worse, the prices stated in their ads aren't even correct. It seemed to me as though there were MORE ads in the \\"ad-free\\" version than there were in the original free edition.<br /><br />I was extremely upset and frustrated, as I purchased the so-called \\"ad free\\" version so that my toddlers could play without having to worry about them clicking on ads and having problems, but instead they have MORE ads.<br /><br />I had also purchased the Star Wars version, and annoyingly enough, the Star Wars Angry Birds links inside the other games continued to point to the ads trying to get me to purchase something I had already bought.<br /><br />I have reverted to the real free version for more enjoyment.

Ive expirenced the same problem with every other app that ive tried my the same developer(s) .  Sorry to say but I might have to uninstall if the problem isn't fixed soon. I'm also having a problem ( minus 2 stars so far...) with the small things that I have to tap on...its driving me crazy!  (minus another star) If these problems are fixed (mainly the exit button)  then I will come back and higher my rating<br />BUT if not fixed then...I will come back and lower it to a 1 star.<br />  BUT...there IS a GOOD SIDE to this app<br />-its very fun and additcting<br />-its really cute<br />I know the developer(s) will likely fix these problems and I dought ill come back and lower my rating<br />  BUT...<br />if I continue to see more problems forming in this app due to updates or anything really I will uninstall.<br /><br />Although great job to the developer(s) for...making a great game that id say is worth downloading<br /><br />Before I go though ...if your ify about getting this app and cant decide weather the bad reviews are right or good reviews are right...I think you should try it to see if you like it...but if you already think its not the app for me because of problems or because its not like you thought it would be then don't get it.  P.S if you cant get it out without shutting your kindle fire or other devise down then click stuff then the kindle fires arrowroot will appear.

The album is mostly soft to medium rock style and is enjoyable when you're reminiscing about your past because this is what the album is mostly about. I wouldn't say that this is her best album. But it is a great album if you're a Taylor Swift's fan. The vinyl edition is significantly better due its uncompressed audio quality.

B000GRU6X8|5.0|A matter of life and death is certainly one of Maiden's best albums during the 21st century. It is probably one of the more unpopular album in their discography. However, it is amazing to see how such an old band is still capable of reigniting its popularity towards younger generation such as myself, born in the 90s. The vinyl edition of this album is perhaps the best part since it contains the best audio quality.

The album proves that the band is moving forward with its music to a newer audience as oppose to stick with their classic songs throughout their career. It is certainly one of the best albums during the 1970s and of all time.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Alien Anthology Blu-Ray set was a solid buy for me. The films look good and they sound even better in this format. There are a wealth of extras between two different blu ray discs that I spent hours and hours enjoying. Each main disc has the Theatrical Release & the directors cut. If you choose the directors cut it can even indicate which scenes were not in the Theatre version, which is a great feature. I would highly recommend this to all the Alien fans out there.

B009E3EY38|4.0|This is a very good concert album and Zeppelin can still soar and thunder, reminding you why they captured your devotional worship many decades past.  Jason's percussion is an ancient army pounding down a rocky hillside, lustful for battle. Jimmy, not a great improvisational blues guitarist as many of his peers were, still does what very few can do and that is to play exactly what the song requires. His great hooks and licks and the compelling complexity with which they complement each other exhibit the musical gift that is his.  Robert is the only vocalist that could have completed Led Zeppelin.  Probably never having received the appreciation he deserves, Jones fills every gap with solid, tasteful bass and/or keyboards, making Zeppelin sound much bigger than 3 musicians.  The clarity of the recording shines light on the chordal and harmonic character of the composition.  All of the inticasies, colors and completeness that lesser song writers never achieve, are here.  For the most part the band is tight.  I did notice a few times where it wasn't quite together, but the inspiration of the performance covered up those shortcomings.  Plant doesn't hit all of the powerful high notes he once did and I miss that.  The sound quality of the recording gets on my nerves, too much reverb and delay.  It doesn't quite sound natural, more like electronics, and either way its too much.  Jimmy's vintage Les Paul sometimes becomes abrasive with too many overly zealous electronic effects.  All of the digital processing drowns the warm tube sound as well as the tone of that great old Les Paul.  Am I glad I bought it?  Sure as hell am.  Celebration is one of those special albums where each time you hear it, you like it more and that usually indicates a classic.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Suspense without being scared to death! Excellent character study of the two main characters. I could not put this book down! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a psychological thriller. Loved the ending!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|The product arrived the same day that Amazon told me, and it was in perfect conditions, the quality of the blue-ray is just amazing, so, I'm very satisfied with the service.<br /><br />The extras are very interesting and explain so much things about how R. Scott made this film and how he wanted to focus it.<br /><br />I just want to clarify to the spanish speakers than the spanish option is in spanish from South America, not from Spain. I thought it could interest to someone.
B003ES5ZTG|5.0|This cable exceeded my expectations! It is easy to hide, and the flat cable looks good on the wall. The fact that the ends are shiftable is a huge plus being that my TV is hanging on a wall and a conventional HDMI cable will not fit near the wall!<br /><br />very satisfied with this purchase
0739375970|1.0|I put off writing this review for a while.  I could not make it through this book. This book and \\"A Feast for Crows\\" have convinced me that Martin has totally lost control of the plot of this series.  There are far too many unresolved, pointless plot lines and characters.  At this point, it seems that Martin is including random thoughts into the story without any consideration of how they advance the plot.  I've given up on this series and would not recommend it to anyone.  Hard core fans will disagree, but there are far better books to read.
B0058YPILY|5.0|i've enjoyed this show since the very beginning and since they dont show reruns of the 7th season on any tv or cable channels, i had to buy the season box set.  well worth it
B0099114WO|1.0|while the cast and setting make it appealing, the movie is just a thinly veiled vehicle to explicitely discuss sex and perversity all treated as preferred behavior. NOT appropriate for young adults.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I found the killing over the top even for me which is unusual. The dialog was a bit too predictable. However, I still recommend<br />it if u have a 1 1/2 to kill.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|It arrives on time, all what I need and the product itself was exactly what I was expecting, I love it
B004H1V5RU|2.0|I requested gift wrap option for this and was given a bag with a bow.  Buyer would be better off purchasing own gifting material instead.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book I would recommend this book to ages 10_12 I didn't dislike anything about this book
B008N1LL42|4.0|I am pleasantly surprised by the movie. I did not have high hopes for it. It is a good summer movie just what you should expect.<br />The acting was good and plenty of action and it never had a slow moment at least to me. I have heard comparisons to Alien and Predator there are similarities but still has it's own twist. The cgi and special effects were excellent they were fluid and seamless and I especially like the alien ships and also the aliens themselves were just enough different to make them believable. The encounter suits were very cool. I would highly recommend this movie to any one who likes a good action flick.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I thought the stand would be more sturdy but it seems if it's on something like a matress it won't stay.  On a table it works fine.  But I got a used one so I can't really complain, you get what you pay for.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked this story.  The main character is a young woman named Katniss.  She lives in a future society that is foreign and fascinating; but also a relatable possibility, since human beings have at times in history formed such bizarre and violent societies.<br /><br />I occasionally felt frustrated because Katniss was such a smart and courageous girl, yet she didn't really question the society she lived in.  She didn't rebel against it or even voice opinions about the morality of what she was forced to do.  She just seemed to play along as best she could.  I think it would be a better book if she showed a little more independent thought, some opinions, some deeper emotional angst, and some searching for answers.  I've read a lot of coming of age novels.  A good book about a young woman who is smart, sensitive, and searching while living in a crazy time in the future is The Earth Girl and Queen Eliza, by C. C. Alma.  [[ASIN:B00AC5MLZ0 The Earth Girl and Queen Eliza]]  I also love The Secret History, by Donna Tartt, [[ASIN:B005PRJT9Q The Secret History]]  a beautifully written long novel about college students in the 1980's.  Overall, though, I would recommend The Hunger Games.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My 9 year old loves this game. He can figure it out on his own and loves being creative. I reward good behavior with Amazon $ so he can grow his island.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I thought the movie did an excellent job of staying within the scope of the book. Peter Weller did a great job as Batman actually all the actors did a fine job. The animation is well done and it set the mood just as the art work in Frank Miller's novel.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Lots of searches..and love the extra puzzle types as well.  The different type of searches also adds a nice twist.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Im hooked! I ignore the housework I should do to read this book - outstanding!  Can't wait for season 3 on HBO to bring this to life
B0053O89WY|5.0|For folks who enjoy The Big Bang Theory, this is yet another season worth purchasing. This was a gift for my mother, and it was at least 30% cheaper than what I could find in stores at the time. Great purchase.
1609611543|5.0|This book is really cool. Its like one big research book on wheat and then includes simple guidelines and recipes at the end. I have not eaten duram wheat since I read this book, and though I have not lost much weight, I have not gained ANY weight since, which is a miracle for me. Now, let me explain, I do not follow this book carefully, I still eat corn tortillas, and a lot of beans which is why I have not lost a lot of weight. When I first started the book, I followed it very carefully and completely lost my belly fat, which is why I gave this book 5 stars - it does EXACTLY what it claims.<br /><br />If nothing else, this book is a great informative read. I learned about Einkorn wheat, which I now eat every once in a while.
0736063684|5.0|I got this as a reference and for ideas...it fits those needs.  I got the idea to buy because the gym owner where I work out keeps a copy for others to review.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Super fast download and I love it already. There's a nice selection of topics to choose from and everything works perfectly. And it's freeee!
B00005JPS8|5.0|Iron Man is a funny and enjoyable action/comedy which will delight viewers. The 2 disc set arrived on time, in the condition which was expected.
B00164GDD2|5.0|This movie rock, its a cult classic. Best of Bill Murray. I don't know what else to say, because I am pretty sure EVERYONE has seen it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show makes me very very happy.  I started watching when Maggie Smith's character said something snippy and mean - I like snippy and mean!
B001CZVVVO|5.0|Throw away all your preconceptions and stereotypes of sober faced singers who stand and deliver.  Out the window goes all concert predictability.  As a Berlin critic wrote, &#34;This evening is the stuff of legend.&#34;  Of course, we are justified in our expectations of a superlative level of singing.  It's here in spades --- but there's infinitely more.  A  marvelous development takes place as we WATCH the singers move from formality TO INTIMACY with the adoring audience.  This is unprecedented in my experience of classical music concerts --- I know this is a big claim and I confidently stand by it.  You'll see abundant evidence on your screen.<br /><br />The entire concert is bouyant and thrilling.  Orchestral episodes are perfectly chosen to confer pacing.  The conductor is obviously at ease & enjoying himself, and the rousing rendition of Rossini's Semirande overture is by far the most zesty and effervescent you're ever likely to hear.  This is an unqualified triumph measured by the highest standards of warm heartedness and the deep love of music and humanity.
0345803493|5.0|In my opinion, the first book of Fifty Shades was a bit slow, and took some time to develop. This time, the book has a much quicker pace with a more interesting storyline. Don't expect this to be a novel that will blow your mind with the twists and turns--it is highly predictable. However, it is still enjoyable and the author does a good job of making the reader understand the characters well.
140011425X|4.0|Nikki Heat has become one of my Fluff books to read.  Nice female cop story with author boyfriend and their dramatics.<br />Nice to read just for the enjoyment of the characters.<br />Also when I read these books I hear them in the character voices from the show Castle.
0718149912|5.0|I like her, so I bought the book.  Nice pictures, well made, could be something I review often but it isn't new news.
141659521X|5.0|Mitch Rapp saves the world once again! Or does he? The ending of this book is written to run directly into the next book, so I can't wait to see what happens then!
B00684J49U|5.0|Another show that will last a long long time, because the characters are fantastic, I will never stop buying Grey's Anatomy because it's superb...the one with the songs oh gosh what a voice she has, but every bit of it are stories different stories although the background is always Meredith and Derek, each characters gets his story told. I love that!
B000NOK06W|3.0|Ennio Morricone is a genius and his work is monumental.  However, when producers create a collection of an artist's work, I wish they would separate the soft, melodic, romantic music from the jazzy, splashy, in your face music.  Please put them on separate CDs.  After listening to the lovely, sad strains of say “Deborah’s Theme,”  I don’t want to have that mood broken by the plucky staccato theme from “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.”  I like both, just not next to each other.  I could certainly make a remix to suit my liking, but why should I be forced to use my own time and resources to do this?  That is why I gave this collection only 3 stars....and it broke my heart to do so.
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase - and love most of the songs on this album.  I also love access via the Cloud Player!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This is a great addition to my Kindle Fire. I use my Kindle constantly. The EZ PDF Reader has made carrying my knitting patterns with me so easy. A plus is that is it was so affordable.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Bones is forever it will never stop. That's it, that's my review!  8 more words required really? you decide that?<br />Fabulous, Catching, Lovely characters,  credible stories, I just wished they had  broadcast more on the recent show, hopefully next season.....love it  love it love it as Much as I loved Angel and that's saying a lot, and he's such a good actor that the first time I watched Bones, desperate for a glance of Angel, he was this total new character, he's one hell of an actor, plus  he's pettier in this show when he gets angry. Temperance is incredible sings like an angel, love that episode. Each characters have their own subtle charm and are a perfect backround and foreground for the magnicient Bones and Booth...and with Zach, never saw it coming wow, keep the good stuff going this is one for the long run...
B001GCUER0|5.0|I am not much of a fan of TV but when I caught Mad Men, I was blown-away, quite likely the BEST EVER drama on TV. Brilliantly written and acted. Dialogue is clever and deep integrating the historic period (early 60s) as an essential background to the drama. The characters are multi-faceted personalities (not the typical stereotypes one often encounters on TV), each with their deficiencies. a I was so awed by the production that I watched Seasons' 1-4 about five times in a row, catching some nuances I had missed from each previous viewing.<br /><br />I note that Thirty Something was, in some ways, a precursor to Mad Men although the time period was later. I also loved the Paper by Ron Howard (a movie) which I found almost perfectly crafted. It appears I have an appreciation of movies the focus of which are the newspaper or media worlds. Network is one of my favorite movies as well.<br /><br />Have not seen Season Five as I have not been able to gain access to it yet. I have heard that is was a little disappointing but I am anxious to see it. The main character of Donald Draper makes the whole show worthwhile in itself.
B005801WTK|3.0|The songs heard repetitively on the radio are the best songs on the album...I do not regrety buying it...I just was not &#34;moved&#34; by the majority of the songs.
1401308201|5.0|Great book, awesome addition to those who have seen the show or even those who haven't.  Great graphics, interesting behind the scenes information.  I loved it
B004YM6JI2|5.0|when I heard the music it reminded me of the music somehow of charmed, wow talk about changing a fantasy into<br />really really scary show, but I recognize some of the same actor,I love the show, my only regret is that you can't seem to keep Jeffrey Dean Morgan alive, I adore him, I saw him in so many shows, he's splendid why do you always kill him off, Supernatura will last for many many seasons Mind you I also love Misha Collins he's a good looking young man,  but John , their father, now he IS the Hunter, and he's gorgeous, my only complaint, bring him BACK.<br />You killed him off in Angel, you killed him of in Grey's Anatomy, and now a show where he can actually live him,, he's killed, what 's the matter with you I want more Jeffrey Dean Morgan!!!!!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I enjoy offbeat and different novels and the appeal of this one being about six different stories interconnected over centuries intrigued me.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down. I went through it in four days. While it is difficult to shift with each story it is worth the effort. I &#34;got&#34; the central premise of how we are all connected by living and have lived. The human spirit will be reborn and love will find a way to always rise above all challenges put in the way, in the end it defines who we where, are and will be.<br /><br />I really want to to see the movie.  Keep an  open mind and just let yourself fall into the story and let it take you on an incredible ride through the lives of it's characters.
B009YX02T8|4.0|So far the only song I really like is Ellie Goulding...but I am a fan of the book/movie and the movie endears the music to me!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I feel ripped off.  Would not have purchased the game if I knew I was being charged 2.99 instead of the advertised. 99<br /><br />Very disappointed
B0084BMUFA|5.0|i loved it. i am reading it in school. i thought it was good but i always forgot it at school so i wanted to download it. i was so happy to find it free! i was amazed
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|This movie was sweet and fun. I love historical fiction, particularly about English royalty. My only complaint is that the movie was over too quickly. I wanted to see more.
092389165X|5.0|\\"Hiroshima\\" first appeared in the New Yorker in 1946, only a year after the U.S. dropped two atom bombs on Japan.  It's a remarkable piece of journalism:  it tells the story of Hiroshima's destruction through the experiences of five ordinary Japanese and a German priest who lived through the bombing and its aftermath.  The writing is spare and factual, and the author lets the horror speak for itself, without sentimentality or editorializing.  It's powerful.<br /><br />That's why \\"Hiroshima\\" has been in print for 65 years.  My junior high and high school libraries had many copies of it.  That was a smart move by the librarians, who knew that young people would benefit from reading a short, thoughtful book on nuclear war.  Maybe \\"Hiroshima\\" even helped to keep the peace during the Cold War, by alerting readers to the risk of nuclear annihilation.  I don't know why I waited until I was 54 to read it.  Better late than never.<br /><br />The Amazon reviewers who fault \\"Hiroshima\\" for not giving the reasons why Truman dropped the bomb are missing the point of the book.  The author engages in no polemics either for or against the bombings; he does not discuss any of the military and diplomatic events surrounding the surrender of Japan.  He simply reports the truth about Hiroshima and helps us visualize the human consequences of the decision to destroy it.  That knowledge surely expands our imagination and improves our capacity for moral and political decision-making in the nuclear age.  Or do conservative \\"patriots\\" think that we shouldn't own the consequences of our decisions?
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We love the Lorax movie. The music is so fun and we find ourselves singing the songs all the time.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|i have only just begun reading J Austen. gasp - at my age! i should have tackled them years ago. i am getting used to her long story introductions and individual character development. usually when i am just about ready to quit reading, the story gets interesting. such insight into an era that is not as prevalent but sadly still exists.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Great, upbeat, fun and funky album. If you were a fan of The Format, you'll be a fan of Fun.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|A lot of laughs.  I love his little face, so expressive.  Kids love this app and it is free, a big plus!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought these books were AWESOME.  I didn't read these books thinking they were going to help me solve world hunger, help cure our national debt, or make me the next Einstein.  I wasn't thinking I was going to discover the next great historian author or someone who would leave a novel behind that would be read for centuries to come.  It's simply a great fiction that covers all the bases that a lot of readers like.  I want to personally give a shout out to E.L. James for making me squirm, giggle, blush, and for writting a book I will always love and will consider one of my favorites!
B00005O3VC|5.0|Thank you for the prompt delivery and the movie arrived in the described condition.  The movie was great and is the perfect gift for the person I bought it for.
B0000073BG|3.0|I had enjoyed this in college many moons ago and while there is nothing wrong with this CD per se, musically I have moved on, although I do appreciate the artistry of Renaissance.
B008NBEXZQ|4.0|Very enjoyable cd from Celine! much less bombastic than most of her (english) albums. ( which I do enjoy too)<br />Here we are treated instead to a warmer, more intimate and personal set of songs, which are much gentler and easier to listen to and  which bring a smile to my face as i listen (even with my  extremely limited french!)<br />Even the cover art reflects this sense of lightness and humor.<br />If you usually only listen to Celine's english albums, give this one a try to see another side of Celine.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Such a great price for one of my favorite movie series! If you love the Alien francise, you need to pick this one up!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Colorful characters but hardly realistic. I miss the tense Grisham legal plots that were rooted in the real world.  This one misses the mark.
B008Y1YFNU|4.0|It's not Papa Roach at its best like when the put out Infested but it's a very good CD considering the era we live in.<br />Papa Roach Rocks
B0063B2BNE|5.0|This is my favorite  show I have every season now. Great story lines and great characters.Recommend to all Bones fans
159420411X|4.0|This book is insightful, generally well-written and thought provoking. I won't summarize the book since many others have already done so. If you follow Silver's blog, a lot of the book will feel familiar; he devotes a few chapters to elections, punditry, baseball and poker. However, even as regular follower of his blog, I found most of the topics to be completely new. He delves into new territories such as artificial intelligence, earthquake prediction and weather forecasting. Quite naturally, I found some topics to be more interesting than others. Silver does have a tendency to be longwinded, so there were times when the book felt very sluggish. In general though, I thought every chapter was a good read.<br /><br />My only major gripe is the poor editing of the book. I've been able to spot typos and misspellings in almost every chapter. They don't take much away from Silver's message, but they are unnecessary distractions. I also picked up on a couple instances of misinformation. One example is when the book introduces Brian Brady, a prominent geologist who incorrectly predicted a number of earthquakes. It mentioned that he got his PhD from MIT, but when I looked him up, the CV on his website says he got his PhD at the Colorado School of Mines (MS at MIT). Again, this is not a big deal but it's a sloppy mistake that detracts from the book's credibility.<br /><br />Silver has the uncanny ability to make complex and even mundane mathematical arguments, accessible and enjoyable to read. Minor flaws aside, I still enjoyed this book. I would give it 3.5 stars as it is - 4, maybe 4.5, without the editorial oversights.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie was recommended to us by a friend with a penchant for really BAD movies.  This time he did not steer us wrong.  Not a fan of the horror genre, we were hesitant. However, we love the spoof movies and this was one of the best.  We laughed and laughed and laughed some more.  Never has gory been so funny.  It is like a live version of a cartoon. I rarely buy movies to watch again but this one is gong in our library.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|get it get it get it!!!!!!!!! I played it for like 3 DAYS IN A ROW! download it and you wont regret it!
B009NX88JU|5.0|This is a great movie with a great soundtrack about a kid who gets caught up in the rock and roll scene after getting an opportunity to write for Cream Magazine. A great watch especially for rock junkies.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a fun Christmas movie for the whole family, the young and old like it equally well. This is a great role for Ferrell, suiting his acting style, and the rest of the casting is wonderful as well.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It's a beautiful box, with 4 amazing Alien films on a blu-ray disc, plus several hours of bonus material and excelent price! Highly recommended.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great headphones, great buy.  Got a notification that it had shipped and checked my door stoop; there it was.  Plugged them in right away, wonder bright sound.
0486278077|2.0|This came by the time they said it would be arriving so I'm glad for that.<br />But I don't remember reading about the rip on the book.<br />Also the cover picture is different than this picture. Does this happen a lot?
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|A better than average hidden object game.  Some games have been difficult to play on the Kindle Fire but this one works well.
0525952926|4.0|Winter Of The World picks up a generation later, telling the story of the children of the characters from Fall Of The Giants. As with its prior novel, Winter moves along at a rapid clip as it weaves the in and out of all the families involved.<br />Set during the time of WWII, it chronicles the rise and fall of the Third Riech from the viewpoints of Britian, Russia, USA and from within Nazi Germany itself.<br />Follett has researched this novel beautifully and more that a history lesson, the characters he has created come to life brilliantly. It is much more than a novel of the time, it is a story of the people who lived through it.
B007I2BYX0|5.0|This band continues to amaze me. Taylor rocks with an excellent voice. Went to see Guns N Roses last year and they opened for them. I had at the time never heard of them and since they have become one of my favorite bands. If your a fan there's only 3 new songs but they Rock
0345803493|5.0|I rated it a five because it drew me right into it as if I was a part of it.I am going to read all three of them again.I hated for it to end and could not get enough of it.The whole story  was excellent.I have never read any other book that was so wonderfully written.My praises to the author,a wonderfull writer and what an imagination.I LOVED IT.

0345803507|5.0|A continuation of the first &#34;Fifty Shades Of Grey&#34; which was enlighting and magnetic and so absorbing.I felt like I was there and watching the whole story unfold.

B004YJMQCS|4.0|Received right away. I had already seen the 2D movie, but my new Dell Laptop has 3D 1080P LED 17.3&#34; screen with Truelife & Nvidia GeForce card so I purchased my first 3D movie. It is a good movie and 3D will blow you away.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This was ordered as a gift. I will have to wait and see if all the follow through is favorable

B007FRHZ4A|4.0|Angry Birds and it's sequel Angry Birds Space is all the rage.  In order to involve an even younger crowd into the Angry Birds experience, the extremely popular app, ANGRY BIRDS SPACE, has now been turned into a board game. Kids seem to enjoy the game. There isn't any educational value to the game, but it does involve some gross motor skills. Also, it's kind of neat to see figures of some of the angry birds. There isn't anything exceptional about ANGRY BIRDS SPACE GAME. However, it does give a different outlook for kids to play Angry Birds Space instead of the electronic version.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|great series
B005LAIGRS|4.0|Denzel Washington gives another star-studded performance in this movie.  Parts of the movie kinda gives the ending away but overall it was a good movie
B005BGBPBG|5.0|This was an enjoyable movie, I had no problems with viewing it and I would recommend it to my friends.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|The first three were somewhat tiresome but worth reading for the verisimilitude and feel of being there and involved in the plot and the ACTION. I should have known with volume four to quit while I was (barely) ahead. Now, no action except when the author thinks he has just about put you to sleep. The dwarf's humor has even grown trite and banal. Now there are only words, and words, and words, and even more words, put together in no particularly pleasing order. When he killed off yet another Stark (Snow) in a matter of half a page to no good purpose, I almost threw the book at the wall. You sold us out Mr. Martin; most sagas are supposed to have an aim and an end. You are NOT a Tolkien. You have made your pile of money now please go enjoy it somewhere rather than destroy your reputation and our reading pleasure further. Shame, shame, shame!<br />Seth Aragon
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I can't wait to give this to my mum on Christmas day! Came quite quickly, a few days before expected.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great game for free! don't have kids so not  very hard for an adult  would like a little bit more of a challenge
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I didn't want a whole giant set...I just wanted all 8 discs contained in one box once all the movies were released. This fits the bill. Yes, it's inexpensive. No, it doesn't contain all the bells and whistles of a fancy collection. But if you want the movies and don't want to take up a lot of space, this is the set for you.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I won't comment on the movie itself, since I assume most people looking to purchase this title actually knows what the movie is about.  My comments reflect what I myself wondered about when I made the decision to purchase this particular Blu-ray/DVD/UV copy combination.<br /><br />Overall Impression: Blu-rays definitely got more love than DVDs for all three Nolan-verse Batman movies. I got this combination because I prefer to have Blu-ray and DVD at the same time, and I think it was a better decision than purchasing the DVD/UV version.  The combo version has three discs -- two Blu-ray and one DVD -- and contains a good amount of special features.<br /><br />Quality: Blu-ray, like with TDK, uses different aspect ratio for IMAX footage, which is great, if not quite as overwhelming on a home screen (46\\" HD for me) as it was on proper IMAX theater screen.  Otherwise, the picture's crisp, sound is good, and my copy's already borne repeated watching with no problems.  DVD uses fixed widescreen format throughout, and again, nothing to complain about.<br /><br />Special Features: Special features are found spread over both of the Blu-ray discs.  I'll try to dig up a full list some other time, but most of them are unique and do not overlap much with the special features for earlier films (except for things like the special documentary on the Tumbler/Batmobiles).  Pretty good materials, overall, though a lack of \\"play everything\\" option (like in the Lord of the Rings appendices) gets a bit annoying for the short segments, but that's about the worst of my gripes.<br /><br />UV Digital Copy: Unlike the digital copies of old (which came with a unique key-code good for one download, set to either Window Media Player or iTunes), TDKR UV digital copy requires the user to sign up for two separate services: Flixster and UltraViolet.  Users are given the option of creating both account at once using the same information.  The downside is that the users MUST use Flixster, as computer program (Windows 7 laptop, for me) or mobile device app (iPod Touch 4G), to download and watch the movie, and it cannot be integrated with any other media players, such as WMP, iTunes, and any other movie-streaming services currently on the web.  Flixster's video player, besides being really basic, DOES freeze once in a while, and the pause-and-return-later option is shaky at best.  For those of us used to iTunes' smoothness, this can be quite annoying.  And again, the hassle of having to register with two separate services and being forced to download and watch the movie using the provider's (admittedly unsophisticated and clumsy) Flixster program makes the UV digital download less than appetizing.  Furthermore, the UV copy is standard definition, and for all my efforts I have been unable to either stream or download HD version, which is another point against.<br /><br />Last Thoughts: Overall, I liked this product.  My only major problem is with the digital copy.  I don't think that should even be a factor to bump up the pricing, given.
1936608618|3.0|Pre-statements for this:<br /><br />I have been coaching endurance athletes for 10 years, mostly runners with a few triathletes thrown in.  I attended USAT and USATF level one clinics many years ago.  I have dozens of all-americans, conference champions, school records and NCAA trophy teams in XC and Track.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) The sections on recovery and tissue mobility are worth the price of the kindle book.  Myofascial release is given little attention in standard running/endurance texts though it is very important to overall muscle health and function.<br /><br />2) The form sections are complete, but please refer back to the title of the review.  I'll address this later, but it's a solid review of the pose method.  Dr. Romanov's books are available, so for further info consult those...<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) The standard Crossfit assumption is how runners just do LSD, paying no attention to mobility/strength/coordination/flexibility, etc.  It's that we repeat the same general pattern, distances and exercises from week to week without viewing a runner as a total athlete.  It's flat out insulting - majorly insulting - to most running coaches.  Part of a \\"new way\\" of training is the intonation that the \\"old way\\" was flawed and poor.<br /><br />2) There is nothing new - not even remotely so - in this book.  \\"The runners of tomorrow will be strong.  The runners will develop themselves through lifting heavy weight and running sand and hills; anything for a heavy, sweating effort.\\"  Percy Cerutty (the legendary Australian coach) said this...  In 1955!!!!!<br /><br />3) Periodization is the idea that you structure training from the least specific to your target race to the most specific work for your target race in a way that gets you to the starting line prepared in the best possible way to succeed at your target race.  CFE removes this process.  The same basic rules apply that CFE takes as their \\"new and true\\".  You need different components at different times of year.  You can't perform the same exercises more than a few weeks in a row.  The body will adapt and plateau if one thing is maintained for too long.  BUT, the difference is that it is planned in periodization to get you to the starting line to perform your best.<br /><br />4) The lifts provided form an excellent base of strength for an endurance athlete.  There are more specific/functional strength exercises you can/should perform as you get closer to race day.  Yes, they will keep up your ability to perform in everyday life while extending your capacity as an endurance athlete.  It's all part of that periodization thing.  These variations in training can and SHOULD be planned, but CFE makes them random.<br /><br />5) POSE pisses me off a bit.  It has good intention, but once again there's the assumption no one runs correctly to begin with.  I teach all of my athletes to pull with their glutes and hamstrings, maintain their foot strike over their center of gravity and those who don't do it to begin with are sure able to do it by the end.  We build the strength in the weight room and teach through every day drills.  I don't have a fancy name for it nor do I make a ton of money selling seminars, but it works.<br /><br />Hopefully this all makes sense.  Big words, decent ideas and a couple of big objections!!

0060763280|1.0|I consider myself pretty smart but oh boy did I feel stupid for buying this book. I realized it as soon as I read the back cover, and then the preface. But just to be sure I read the first couple pages and sure enough I've just been had, for $18 bucks!<br /><br />Sure people say what do you have to loose for paying $18 bucks. Well, $18 bucks would have been better spent on lunch.<br /><br />Like other snake oil sellers like Tony Robbins and Robert Kiyosaki (Rich Dad Poor Dad), it's the exact same message. The story goes like this: I was poor, met some rich 'dad' who gave me some insight, and then everything changed. They promise you stuffs but never deliver any substance. Basically blowing smoke up you know what.<br /><br />So save your money and read stuffs like Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. You can look up a free pdf version of that book on the internet. It was first published in the 30s and is still selling well today. The free internet version is much better than the recently published revised edition.

0307346617|5.0|I just devoured this book, and quite frankly, I'm a little upset that no one here has recommended it to me before now.  It is probably, hands down, the best interpretation (written or visual) of a zombie outbreak that I have ever enjoyed; up to and including The Walking Dead.  That's right, I said it; I think this book eats The Walking Dead for breakfast and defecates 28 Days Later.<br /><br />From the greed and capitalism that lead people to capitalize on fear with \\"miracle drugs\\" which, due to the psychological fractures of the \\"Quishies\\" (or Q's), seemed to work and gave first world nations hope, to the skeptical bureaucracy that enabled an administration to ignore and obfuscate a rising global epidemic, we see a \\"realistic\\" insight on how the world could come crashing down.<br /><br />This is the part of the zombie outbreak that every zombie story glosses over or completely ignores.  It isn't an immediate outbreak starting from one epicenter.  It's spread, through lies, deceit, and greed.  It's spread through false sense of security, and the egos and pride that think we can handle it on our own.  It's spread through the compassion of trying to save everyone, and emotional attachments to our gadget filled lives.<br /><br />This work of fiction is obviously just that, a work of fiction.  However, it is founded on some very sound psychological, geopolitical, and military research.  Combining that with the interview narrative style, that leaves a lot of small gaps as it progresses from Patient Zero to the Rockie Line (and all of its propaganda, logistics, and administration) leads the reader to fill in the missing narration with what they infer to be the missing causal links.<br /><br />The overall effect? A remarkably convincing work of fiction that caused me, on one occasion, to google the name of some of the officials just to ascertain the exact boundary between fact and fiction.  Overall, this is by far one of the best books I've read this year.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|The Ultraviolet \\"Digital\\" copy is not compatible with the iTunes library.  In order to use it you must first download the Flixter app which does not work correctly on the apple devices.  This means that if you have an apple device, you now have to keep 2 libraries.  The claim that this is a digital copy that works on iPhone and iPad is very misleading and extremely frustrating.  If, like me, you go out of your way to buy a blu-ray with \\"digital\\" copy so that you can put it on an iPad, don't bother with this great movie.
1451696191|5.0|This was one of the better books I've read in the past year.  It had a narrative format in which the main character, Charlie, writes letters to an anonymous confidant.  At first, I wasn't sure how well I would like this format, but Stephen Chbosky does a phenomenal job grabbing your attention from the very beginning; so I stuck with the book and by the end, I found myself enjoying the format.  It made the book feel light in spite of it's very heavy content.<br /><br />What I found interesting about the book is that it's captivating.  I read the entire thing in just over four hours and when I was done I wasn't entirely sure why.  I knew I loved the book, and I knew I left the book with a new music playlist [...] and more books for my reading list [...]; but beyond that, I wasn't sure why I devoured the book like I did.  It was unlike anything I'd read recently, and if I were to measure it with my normal metrics, it would likely fail across the board.<br /><br />In spite of me never having had a high school experience anywhere near as dramatic as his, I did feel as if I could relate to Charlie.  I think we can all relate to the books underlying message of \\"passion over passivity,\\" but the eloquence in which Chbosky draws you into empathizing with a character that's nuttier than an Almond Joy is quite impressive.

B0059XTU22|3.0|I can't say that was all that excited to see this prequel of sorts to the great \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.  I had this pang in my gut fearing this would be something on the order of George Lucas restarting the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy with the silly \\"Phantom Menace\\" in 1999.  Fear assuaged for the most part.<br /><br />This preamble begins when Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) decides to write the story of how he originally took possession of the infamous ring.  His narration leads us back to his younger self (excellent Martin Freeman) who is inexplicably recruited by the wizard Gandalf (returning Ian McKellen).  Their story is relatively simple.  They are to help the 13 survivors of the dwarf kingdom, now led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) in recapturing their mountain home held by a vicious dragon.<br /><br />The movie is about their journey getting there.  Naturally there are enemies in their way, real and imagined.  Not the least of which is an army of orcs and their giant wolf-like steeds.  Scary to look at, the orcs are easily picked off inside their secluded compound by the dwarfs.  I couldn't figure that one out.  The orcs also have the ability to find dwarfs using a keen sense of smell...well except when they climb up in a tree.  Another head-scratcher.<br /><br />Director, writer and head honcho of all things Tolkien has the look down pat.  Although I must admit, some of the backdrops looked a little too CGI.  Perhaps the film had slowed to a point where I was just a bit too focused elsewhere.  The film does seem to ponder at times.  There is one scene when Bilbo falls down a jagged crevice in the orcs mountainous home (unscathed by the way) and first meets Gollum (the great Andy Serkis).<br /><br />Sensing everyone has been waiting for Gollum to appear, Jackson lingers forever in this confrontation.  Bilbo and Gollum go through several rounds of verbal riddles, slowing everything down.  Was the 2 hour and 46 minute running time really necessary?  I don't think so.  Several characters from the \\"Rings\\" make brief appearances including Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman and Elijah Wood as Frodo.  \\"The Hobbit\\" will likely please many and irate others.  I'm reasonably satisfied but hope for better things to follow.<br /><br />I watched this movie on an IMAX screen in 3D so didn't see the controversial faster speed film shown in standard theaters.  As is usually the case the IMAX print looks great.  The 3D isn't over done and has a natural look with plenty of depth.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (12-11-13):<br /><br />In preparation for the new \\"Hobbit\\" film soon to debut, I took another look at this first film in the franchise.  This time on Blu ray.  My original observations are solidified.  The film is yawn inducing at times and doesn't justify its running time which pushes 3 hours.  The film looks good for the most part and the acting is good.  A decent, if underwhelming, start for the series.<br /><br />While I might take issue with the movie, I have none with the Blu ray version (Blu-ray + DVD + UltraViolet).  This movie really looks good on this disc.  The 1080p transfer includes a 2.4:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are dramatic.  Blues, browns, orange are excellent as are the blacks.  Fleshtones are excellent as well.  Detail and definition is clear and crisp.  I found no faults with the video.  This is one of the better films for demo purposes.<br /><br />Speaking of demo, I'd be hard pressed to come up with a better audio track to show off either.  The disc comes with a killer DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  The producers make great use of the surrounds with plenty of thunder for the subwoofer(s).  A couple scenes to note include the section where giant eagles save the dwarves from certain doom at the hands of the orcs.  Another great use of woofers and subs is the scene where the dwarves are climbing a mountain and the mountain comes alive and becomes 2 separate \\"fighters.\\"  While thismade no sense to me, it looked and sounded great.<br /><br />Extras include a look at New Zealand where the film was made, a couple hours of video blogs, and some trailers including one for games.made no sense to me, it looked and sounded great.<br /><br />Extras include a look at New Zealand where the film was made, a couple hours of video blogs, and some trailers including one for games.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The Power of Habit is a lightweight, educational and engaging read that delves into the questions of what makes us tick.  Answering the questions about how habits are formed, how we internalize our decisions, and how addictions are formed, the book is a short read that is a must for anyone looking to learn more about their noggin.<br /><br />One example used is McDonalds.  Habits are formed by a repeated cycle of cue -> repeatable routine -> reward, and McDonalds knows this.  Their memorable arch is your cue, their stores are standardized, their menus all look the same, and the employees' greetings are pretty standard to give a routine, and their food is specifically designed to trigger the reward centers of your brain.  Thus making McDonalds (and I'd infer all fast food) a habitual stop for consumers.<br /><br />There are countless examples in the book, some of which will blow you away as you're made aware of things you'd never stopped to question.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is a real bargain. It is just the right size to accommodate a Nikon D7000, five lenses, filters, an SB 910 flash, a battery charger, and assorted little stuff. The items fit snuggly in a well cushioned compartment. They are easy to store and easy to retrieve. The bag is about two thirds the size of the bags I see other photographers hefting, looking as if they are pursuing a trek in the Himalayas. The price is great. I've ordered two additional bags.
0345803507|4.0|The first 50 Shades book was obviously amazing. It's unlike anything I've ever read. Very real and raw and uncut which I love. The second book is a little harder to get going just because it's the same style of writing and she uses a lot of the same phrases and sentences as she did in the first book. I have not read the whole thing so I cannot judge it that much, but I am excited to read the rest!
B006QS0PF0|5.0|I was hesitant to buy and read de Rossi's work for a long time because I was worried this book was just a scam to get publicity after her acting career nearly became extinct. Luckily for me, while on a memoir binge, I decided to pick up this book on amazon and saw that it was highly rated. I knew in a very general sense that the book would be about de Rossi's eating disorders and about being gay in Hollywood in the 90s and dating and marrying Ellen, but I wasn't expecting to be driven so deeply into her world and experiences with her superb writing. The self-hating internal voice of her eating disorder, which she describes as 'the drill-sergeant,' reminded me so much of my own inner demons. The book is for anyone who has ever been too hard on themselves, lied to hide parts of themselves they couldn't accept, or self-sabotaged until they hit rock bottom. So in essence, this book is really for everyone. There are parts in the book that are heartbreaking, but ultimately, it reveals the delicate emotional strength of a woman who eventually recovers. My heart goes out to de Rossi and her lovely wife. Well done.

1417667109|4.0|I liked this book; it left me tired many mornings from staying up too late and reading, as most good books do.  Having seen the move multiple times before reading the book, I really appreciated the expanded understanding of the main characters in the book.  Knowing more about what was going on inside of Danny's head, Jack's head, and the strong relationship between Danny and Hallorann (the chef) really enhanced the story for me.  The thorough history of the hotel and continued expansions on what took place there also really added a lot.  The book made it possible to connect to each of the characters in some way and connect an psychological explanation/understanding for everything rather than just seeing the story as a madman flipping out on his family.  The parts that were creepy in the movie and the parts that made me most jumpy in the book were surprisingly different.  I like the book much better than the movie.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Great quality movie. So glad I purchased this! I would recommend this classic to anyone. The picture and sound quality were excellent.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Many other reviewers have noted that this most recent work by Mr. Clancy doesn't live up to their expectations or keep them on the edge of their seat like \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" or \\"Clear and Present Danger\\".  If however, one reviews this book without the nostalgia of one's youth, then I believe it stands on its own and is a very enjoyable thriller.<br /><br />Realize we can't be nine years old again and watch \\"Star Wars\\" on a Sunday afternoon after church with our friends and compare every Sci-Fi movie to that experience any more than we can think back to how we felt when we first visited the Soviet submarine Red October 27 years ago and hold every Clancy novel up to that experience.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, this is a good book and you will be glad you cozied up with it for a few hours.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|After watching the HBO series &#34;The Pacific&#34; and being less than blown away (it was o.k., but no &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;), I was left Eugene Sledge and a good friend of mine (a retired jar-head) recommended this book.  It puts into words the real hell of war, you can almost imagine what these kids went through.  I say almost, because when you read his graphic depiction of his experiences in the pacific war, a part of you wants to believe that it's been embellished, but in your heart you know that bad memories fade and the reality of E.B's war was probably much worse.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is a beautiful timepiece and it wears very well.  I was concerned about the size and height of the watch, but my fears were definitely unfounded.  It is not tall or bulky, it is very light and practical.  My ONLY negative, and it is very minor is that the automatic winding feature, while very cool, is kinda loud.  I do notice the sound of the weight moving in the watch when I move, but it slowly moving to background noise.  I love this watch and am thinking of purchasing the same one in black!

B005LAJ1O0|4.0|Finally, another show arrives to television worthy of viewing. This is a series about a haunted house with a twist. I don't want to give anything away. Quick synopsis: A family of three leave Boston, MA and relocate to Los Angeles, CA to begin a new life. All does not go asell as expected, to say the least. This has an interesting premise which will bring viewers back week after week. This is a show, I feel that either vieweres will either like or not. Overall, I'm looking forward to watching the rest of these shows. If you're a fan of ghost stories and such, you should enjoy this series. It isn't perfect, hence the four stars. There are a few slow spots, but mostly, this show has a fast forward momemtum to enjoy.
0812550706|4.0|All it takes is a look at my bookshelves (or my reviewing history) to see that this book is different than what I usually read and talk about.  So I was surprised when I really got pulled into this book.  The plot follows Ender Wiggin, a small boy, who has the fate of the world resting on his shoulders.  Sounds like a burden, right?    A lot of what this book deals with is political and psychological as you wonder if what the adults are putting through Ender is humane and worthy.  Though the setting for the novel is primarily Earth, it is set in the future when space travel is common and there are new technologies and government structures.  Card does a fantastic job of taking so many different sub-plots until at the end of the book the reader is completely satisfied with what is given throughout the story.  Though the story is a part of a series, it is very possible to be appeased with just this one novel.    I was a little worried near the middle of the book while Ender is in battle school and the plot-line starts to plateau.  I started reading slower and even picked up a second book to read at times.  However, it is worth it to plow through the slower sections, because overall the book is definitely worth a read.    [...]

The mechanical lock that holds the card in position gave up and the card disconnected - I could hold it in place with tape or my finger.<br /><br />From what I could see from the few slides I scanned, it does work as a 35mm slide scanner.

B008ELUEQC|4.0|Rod Stewart had never attempted a holiday LP.<br /><br />I rate this four stars, because I did not like EVERY song on the CD.<br />My favorites he performs very well.<br />Rod Stewarts' Great American Songbook Series, prepared him for this avenue.<br />And this holiday effort is a welcome addition to any yuletide collection.

B0087JTAKW|2.0|I hate to agree with the reviewers who did not like this book. I have been moved, entertained, inspired, and challenged by all of Mr. Albom's other books. These characters were not developed, the book was shallow and predictable. Can hardly believe it was written by this wonderful author.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Three quarters of the book was just ok. It did get more interesting and intense at the end. I would recommend it. Although, I think it would be better as a movie.

B001AQR3IU|5.0|My husband saw this movie first, and said I had to see it. We ordered it from Amazon and I was pleased ! It was funny, yet serious, intriguing and suspenseful. The acting and characters were all well done. Fun cameos from well-known actors. Great makeup and visual effects. This is a new favorite of mine! It's a great date night movie or family film, with something for everyone.

B006H5120E|5.0|I have always been mixed on Titanic. The technical aspects of the film are surely to be admired but the plot has plenty that legitimately could be criticized.  I won't really touch on that since our culture has had 15 years to decide if if Titanic is worthy of admiration.<br /><br />The 3D conversion of this film was awesome to say the least.  The film itself was so bright and crisp it was like I was watching the movie for the first time.  There are few films that I can sit through for over 3 hours and this version of the film was one of them.  Keep in mind I had just sat through The Hobbit earlier in the day so it takes a lot to keep my attention that long.<br /><br />If you have a 3D TV this is a must have for your library, James Cameron continues to prove why he is one of our generations greatest film makers!
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My kids don't get the cards out and play the game.  My four and seven year old get together with the neighborhood kids and build a tower (we have 3 different versions so there are enough pieces) and then launch birds until the tower has come down.  I think that there is even a little educational value to this game, the physics of launching the bird and the thought process of the best way to build a tower and even the patience that is takes to set everything up.<br />My son carries these silly birds everywhere with him, this is one of his favorite toys so I can't understand all of these negative reviews.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|It's a very entertaining seek and find type game. It has multiple levels and several types of games. Though it gets a little repetitive, the storyline and tasks keep it interesting. Several reviews complained about the lack of zoom, but the version I have does this option.  Overall, I would recommend this app if you like these types of games.

B0015AARJI|1.0|I charged it and it worked and then stopped taking a charge.  I have more than one controller so I rotate them and by the time I got back to using this (new) controller it did not work anymore and seller was not willing to help since it was more than 30 days.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|UPDATE: After getting used to it a while longer, I feel I jumped the gun a bit on some things. While you will have to find a way to set it up to make it comfortable and still see well, once you do it's very nice. Also, the solution to my buzzing problem seems to have been to plug in headphones. Since my first time plugging in headphones, I haven't noticed buzzing with or without them in. There is still room for improvement and I still don't like the CVA, but ultimately this is an affordable solution if you want to make your ps3 portable. *Upgraded to 4 stars*<br /><br />Backstory: I travel nearly every weekend and like to be able to game when I do, so when I bought the new super slim ps3 bundle for my home I decided to get this to put my old ps3 slim in. I was able to get it for significant discount on an amazon black friday week lightning deal.<br /><br />What I like: It feels sturdy, the handle is different material and doesn't feel like it would slip out of your hand, the clasps are strong, the system sits snug on the platform and gets strapped in, I trust my console is safe in this case. It came with a perfect size HDMI cord, the screen is sharp, the bags can come out so you can fill them then put them back in, and obviously it makes the playstation 3 a portable gaming system as long as you have power and internet. Heck, you could play this at McDonald's if you wanted.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />The screen:<br />-  Competitive Viewing Angle is not for me or anyone who wants to be comfortable while playing their games. I've found two ways to make it work for any gaming session longer than 10 minutes (so all gaming sessions) and be comfortable. If I'm on a low-sitting couch and I place this on the floor or if I'm sitting upright in a chair and this is on a table directly in front of me at eye-level. Unfortunately, whether it's on the floor or on the table and moved back far enough to rest your hands, it's so far away for that small screen that it's damn near impossible to maintain a high level of competitiveness. I usually find myself leaning forward to try to see what is going on and ending up staying in a very uncomfortable position for extended periods of time, usually my back is a little sore and sometimes also my neck. If you sit as the kids in the picture in the product description are doing, your legs will go numb, your hips will hurt, your back will hurt, your neck will hurt, and if you're not leaning forward you still won't be seeing well enough to play at a high skill level. (Trust me, I've done it) Off-line multiplayer especially split-screen, just forget about it, I played with a friend and we had to sit so close, you would have thought we were trying to survive though a blizzard off each others' body heat. There's no way any of those kids in that product description picture are playing well and the kid in the back probably can't see at all.<br /><br />- Brightness, there is none. I first tried playing Assassin's Creed 3 on this, I could barely if at all see what was going on at all in any missions besides day-time naval ones. I cranked the brightness on the screen all the way up and there was no noticeable difference, I was able to change the brightness in game, and now keep the screen brightness back at 50. Unfortunately with Black Ops 2, even with in-game and the screen brightness at maximum, it's difficult to see. Zombies is not worth trying and if you're playing online multiplayer all you can do is pray you never get stuck playing Plaza (the night map).<br /><br />- The screen is buzzing, for about the first half hour I played on it, there was a buzzing that came from the screen, it stopped though, until hours later it started buzzing again for about 10 minutes then went away. It has been happening here or there but was never anything I couldn't deal with until this weekend. I played with a friend this past weekend for about an hour and a half and the buzzing never stopped. I'm not sure what the problem is with that, I hope it will stop for good soon.<br /><br />The size:<br />-Not enough storage space, even if you jam all the cords into one bag and force two controllers into the other (doesn't fit more than one nicely), you still have nowhere to put your games or headset (even a bluetooth) without having to worry about damaging them or the screen.<br /><br />-Too compact, besides the storage problem, the screen sits too close to the back of the system, not enough open air. I'm scared to play for more than a couple hours at a time because of how hot the back of the ps3 gets. Then when I go to shut it off, even the monitor controls are hot to the touch.<br /><br />-Blocks USB ports, the way the plastic is shaped, it makes it a pain (literally, you can cut your fingers on the sharp plastic) to plug into the two usb ports on the ps3 slim to charge your controller or use a wired headset.<br /><br />Cord management:<br />-The cords hang out of the side, sometimes bend if front of screen so you have to position them just right.<br /><br />-You have to plug in power for tv and console and HDMI cord every time you set up.<br /><br />It would be nice if you could just leave the console hooked to the screen and have a shared power source so you could just plug one cord into an outlet and start playing without having to dig 3 or 4 out from a pouch, untangle them and plug them in and position them is such a way that they don't block the screen. Right now, it's not as portable as I thought it would be.<br /><br />Overall I'm content with my purchase, but if I would have payed the regular $250 price I would have been very disappointed.

B00012FXAE|5.0|One of the best science fiction and or horror films ever made. James Cameron made an absolute masterpiece with this sequel to Ridley Scott's equal classic &#34;Alien&#34;. The collector's edition has enough to keep you busy and engulfed in the world of &#34;Aliens&#34; for multiple viewings. Great box cover art and the special features are essential for any true fan of the film to watch. Okay, maybe not essential but it's well worth the money!

160774273X|5.0|My wife and I have been cooking and baking for over 20 years and would consider ourselves capable of mastering most intermediate to advanced recipes for home kitchens.  I have purchased (and loved to a measure) quite a few reputable books on baking artisan breads, but they all came up wanting because they tried to make-do for the home baker by using active dry yeast, baking stones, and spritzing the insides of the oven to create steam.<br /><br />I love the simplicity of Mr. Forkish's book, moving you from same-day, to overnight, to pre-ferments, to levains.  It's a bread-baking course, uncluttered by a bunch of additives, except for some occasional whole wheat flour for interest and texture, that shows his real love of the craft.<br /><br />I knew variances in temperature (ambient, water, and oven), flour quality, and humidity would affect my bread, but I didn't know what it should be to make my bread great.  Now I do.  My advice: follow the recipes exactly before playing around.  Get the SAF instant yeast (not active dry yeast), get flour sourced from Shepherd's Grain or King Arthur if you can (and Caputo '00' for pizzas), get a good instant, digital thermometer, get a reliable oven thermometer, and then trust the method.<br /><br />You will hear the crackle of crust as your loaves cool and you will tear them open to see interesting textures and taste the dark, caramelized crust.  I have access to good bread in Seattle and this is as good or better than anything I have purchased, even at my favorite bakeries.  More advice: use a heavy baking stone on the bottom rack of the oven to avoid scorching the bottoms of your loaves if you use a cast iron dutch oven on the middle rack.  It diffuses the heat nicely and helps the oven keep temperature.  I haven't co-opted one of my wife's precious enameled dutch ovens to see if loaves would scorch in one of those without a stone at the bottom of the oven.  But I just might bribe her with more bread to find out.  Finally, thepizza method with Caputo flour plus simple, fresh local toppings will transport you to Serious Pie in Seattle. Good stuff.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I always look forward to Ian McEwan releasing a book and this past year was no different with the publication of Sweet Tooth. The thing about it is that I am never sure when he releases a book if it is going to be more like Chesil Beach or more like Atonement.  So I jumped into Sweet Tooth with a lot of vigor and was for the most part pleased with the book. I just didn't find it to be one of his best and therefore gave it 3 stars. The book itself is about a woman named Serena Frome (which rhymes with plume as is mentioned in the opening line of the book) who is about to graduate college in England and is recruited by MI5 to be a spy. Serena is depicted as beautiful and sexy and alluring as well as smart and she seems to be the ideal spy.  Her attractiveness I believe is her real downfall as every time she gets into an assignment she seems to use her sexiness to her downfall. That said, she is put onto the Sweet Tooth project aimed at getting authors to write positively against Communism. The project goes well until Serena falls in love with the author she is targeting. The book ends with what you may call a surprise ending that again ties into Serena's constant desire for companionship.  I thought it was a good but largely average book that was probably 50 pages too long. Hard core McEwan writers will find it pretty enjoyable.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|What an adorable story. Very well written and entertaining.  An enjoyable read despite the moments of pure heartbreak. John Green 's novel appeals to readers of all ages.
1594484805|3.0|I read this on the recommendation of someone. It the beginning was following the information closely but about 1/2 way through I felt the material lost substance. It is good information but I found I lost interest when the good material ran out and the old material seemed to be recycled through again.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|This is a great movie, i wanted to have it on DVD, so I bought it, would have liked a bit more features, seems as the extras are now all going on the Blu Ray versions, oh well, what can I say, but the quality is really good, and really close to HD
B0060AY85C|4.0|Toni Morrison's latest novella--Home--made it onto the NY Times 100 Notable Books of 2012 and I picked it up the other day and took a quick spin through it. I was impressed. I thought the book was really well written, very tight, compelling, and a good read.  The book itself is about a man--Frank Money--who comes back damaged in many ways from his tour in the Korean War.  He has seen his two best buddies blown to pieces and die in front of him. He finds himself back in a very racist US and as a result has to move from city to city until he eventually ends up in his hometown of Georgia. His sister ends up going to work for a corrupt doctor, gets sick, and is rescued by Frank who ends up saving her and becoming close to her once again.  As close as they were in their childhood.  A very good quick read.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|So very disappointed.  They could have glorified this great lady and global leader, but they blew it badly.  How very sad to miss the opportunity.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|There are a few things I wish this game had, such as an easier way to keep track of your Dragon inventory, but it still keeps me coming back to try to breed the new types of dragons.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Like all of the other Bourne movies and books, this one is up there. A great story line and great acting.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I liked these books. There were plot twists and turns. Some things were a little predictable, but rarely. The characters were well thought out and I liked the main characters.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Wow! The best point-and-click adventure game I've played on the Fire HD. Great music, graphics, storyline and playability.  Hours of enjoyment.
0316228532|5.0|This book was pre-ordered and came so quickly, it surprised my daughter, a J.K. Rowling devotee, before she got the idea in her head to purchase it.  She loves it!
B009MF56GC|3.0|I would have expected this movie to be better than it was with all of the well known actors in it. The story line was somewhat weak.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Awesome book.  Could not put it down until it was done. Action, intrigue, and a little romance, set in a beautiful country make this book one of my favorites.

B009E3EY38|5.0|There's a lot to celebrate about this CD and DVD set--the audio and visual quality are top notch.  I bought this as a gift for my husband who is an audiophile--he's VERY particular about sound and visual quality, and difficult to please when it comes to concert videos and CDs-- and he was so impressed with Celebration Day that he watched the DVD several days in a row, over and over....he's even considering gifting it to his 65 yr old father who is also an audiophile-- his father is a classical music aficionado but my husband thinks he would be duly impressed by the masterful sound, video (and, of course, musicianship of Led Zepplin!) presented in &#34;Celebration Day.&#34;  The song selection was good, though of course we wished it were even longer since it's SUCH a fantastic concert.  I have to say, I couldn't believe the pricetag on this thing--an absolute steal/bargain.  Best purchase of the year, hands down.
B009329ZF2|4.0|High action movie and better than excellent computer graphics. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is a little weak on the story line. Overall pretty good though.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This is a great read, and hard to put down.  Not quite as good as the first, as it is slightly more predictable, but still very enjoyable.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|Just finished reading this with my 7 and 5 year old. We all loved it! Some explanation was needed for them to truly understand it, but that was to be expected. A true Christmas classic!
B004HW7JH4|3.0|A bit disappointed in this series but it seemed to redeem itself in the last few episodes.<br /><br />Some nasty moments spoiled it for me and I was left thinking the series should have finished at season 4.  As usual the Americans do something to death and instead of a memorable, wonderful television show that leaves you wanting it to never end we see a show fading away to a Desperate Housewives type ending where ideas and scripts become a travesty of what preceded them in the earlier episodes.
B00005AQE7|5.0|it's a great product. Tupac is the best rapper that ever lived and Lil Wayne sucks. it's just the truth
B00005JNJV|2.0|While Batman Begins doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel when it comes to comic book movie adaptations, i.e. Batman & Robin, it is certainly not the apex of the Batman franchise that everyone claims it to be. The first hour is arguably the best part of the film, which chronicles Bruce Wayne's journey to becoming Batman, and his tutelage under Liam Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul. However, the second hour is truly a series of missed opportunities. Tom Wilkinson's Carmine Falcone is a disappointing caricature of Jame Gandolfini's Tony Soprano, while Katie Holmes is an unfortunate casualty of the terrible dialogue that runs rampant throughout the course of this movie (i.e. Liam Neeson at one point says, \\"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy.\\"). My advice would be to skip this film, and go straight to its sequels [[ASIN:B001OGWY1W The Dark Knight]] and [[ASIN:B00AHSIQWE The Dark Knight Rises]], which are vastly superior both in terms of dialogue, plot, cinematography, and character development. However, if you are looking for a film that truly embodies all things Batman then I encourage you to watch Tim Burton's classic first [[ASIN:B0013WJGJ0 Batman]] starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.

B006LSZECO|2.0|Easy read but not spell binding.  The last half of the book was much better than the first. Would not give more than than 3 stars.
0399224459|5.0|On the first review this was an average to good child's book, but after multiple daily requests for readings for over 4 months now I have come to believe this is a great book for the young ones. My 16 month old Granddaughter can read this book. She knows where every balloon, moon, and banana are. She knows all the animals and what they say. And she is getting the humor of having a bunch of animals talk to you in the dark of your bedroom.

B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|We got our kindergartner one of these this year, and it is probably his favorite thing this month. He is crazy for Lego Star Wars and this was right up his alley.<br /><br />The toys are pretty small, but very cute and cleverly designed. The mini AT-AT was awesome!  :-)<br /><br />It's a bit expensive, but great fun and the perfect gift for your favorite Lego maniac!
B005EY2XFC|5.0|While watching this, all you can think about is how sad it is that Brandon dies shortly after making this film.  I'm sure he would have went onto other great roles and fight scenes.  The film is dark and eerie, and the sound track rocks all of the way through.  The extras packed into this, also make it worth it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Intricate, believable, another great Harry Bosch story. It is very interesting to revisit the Rodney King riot through the eyes of Michael Connelly as told by Harry Bosch.
B005LAII12|4.0|Whether it's &#34;Family Guy&#34; or an interview, the beauty of Seth MacFarlane is this:<br /><br />You know you're thinking it; He's thinking it AND says it out loud.<br /><br />&#34;Ted&#34; is a prime example of this. As if the madcap and maddening adventures of a 35 year-old with a talking plush teddy bear aren't enough as it is, just as you're sitting there thinking &#34;it would be SO messed up if he said/did/smoked this,&#34; either Mark Wahlberg or the bear says it or does it or smokes it.<br /><br />Not for kids, by any stretch. The language is beyond coarse and the action gets racy as well. This is Snuggle the Fabric Softener Bear if the fabric softener bottle is filled with over-proof tequila, and you're fighting over the worm with a stuffed animal with a bacchanalian bent.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|In order to play different games you must play games to earn points to unlock them.  I rather just have all games unlocked and allow me to play the ones I enjoy the most.  Instead I have to play a few games and take forever to earn points to unlock.  The games get boring really fast and the graphics are really terrible.  Plus, there's a lot of ads within the game and in-game purchases to get more coins.  Gets frustrating when they keep asking me over and over when it's an obvious no.  Other than that, it's a good waste of time.  There's such much more better free games out there.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Machine Head sure set the bar awfully high with their last album \\"The Blackening.\\" In fact, some might argue that they set the bar too high -- almost impossibly high. Almost. The seventh full-length from the studio finds MH continuing this same basic attitude used on that 2007 release, opting for a heavier, huger, and more epic and riff-centered approach than what was heard on any of MH's other, older albums. In true Eighties thrash fashion, 2011's blistering \\"The Locust\\" might have only seven tracks to its name, but fans definitely still get their money's worth, as the songs themselves are very epic (they range from the upper-five-minute to mid-eight minute mark). And they sure cut deep, too, as they are crammed with riffage that is as excellent as it is blistering, exceptional solos, deft drumming, mathematically-calculated rhythms, and powerful vocals.<br /><br />It all kicks off with the sound of a haunting boys choir in the intro of \\"I Am Hell,\\" before slamming into a brutal, full-on thrash attack with thunderous, staccato riffing and driving double bass slamming. It does make room for some melody in the form of a beautiful string arrangement in one of the melodic choruses. But then, the song, inevitably, comes roaring back with pounding rhythms and a wah-drenched solo. Next up, if there ever was a mosh-pit-ready track on this record, it would be \\"Be Still And Know,\\" which boasts very Mastodon-ian riffs and rhythms, in addition to its rolling, double bass fills, blistering solo, nice backing guitar harmonies, and a massive, towering -- and instinctively memorable -- chorus. \\"Locust\\" almost, seemingly, picks up where its predecessor left off. Indeed, it is all great -- and really dexterous -- drum fills, abrasively grinding, crunching, chugging guitar hooks, and moshable, anthemic choruses. An epic, winding, shredding guitar solo section (which pays a loving tribute to one of Machine Head's biggest influences: Pantera) is included, here, too.<br /><br />Aside from a harmonic acoustic guitar intro, \\"This Is the End\\" mostly gets by on propulsive tempos and heart-racing double-time thrashing/thrash beats. However, the tune is also of note for having another really memorable and catchy chorus, which comes in the form of an epic, song-songy refrain, too. \\"Darkness Within\\" is a near ballad with an excellent, epic build-up, and a pair of piercing guitar solos. But \\"Pearls Before The Swine\\" is the album's possible highpoint, because, quite frankly, it has it all -- interesting, funky-sounding bass lines, pounding toms, sputtering blast beats, and busy, chunky thrash riffing. Oh, and how about the fact that six-stringer Phil Demmel sure lets rip, here, by uncorking a ripping, whammy-bar-drenched guitar solo? Finally, the closing \\"Who We Are\\" offers mostly more of the same good stuff: Contagiously deep and adherent grooves, crunchy riffing, and trades-off a pair of unorthodox, shredding solos.<br /><br />So, there you have it. \\"Unto The Locust\\" is every bit the great album that \\"The Blackening\\" was. I am undecided as to whether or not this 2011 release trumps that 2007 one, but one thing is for certain: It definitely comes very, very close.om a harmonic acoustic guitar intro, \\"This Is the End\\" mostly gets by on propulsive tempos and heart-racing double-time thrashing/thrash beats. However, the tune is also of note for having another really memorable and catchy chorus, which comes in the form of an epic, song-songy refrain, too. \\"Darkness Within\\" is a near ballad with an excellent, epic build-up, and a pair of piercing guitar solos. But \\"Pearls Before The Swine\\" is the album's possible highpoint, because, quite frankly, it has it all -- interesting, funky-sounding bass lines, pounding toms, sputtering blast beats, and busy, chunky thrash riffing. Oh, and how about the fact that six-stringer Phil Demmel sure lets rip, here, by uncorking a ripping, whammy-bar-drenched guitar solo? Finally, the closing \\"Who We Are\\" offers mostly more of the same good stuff: Contagiously deep and adherent grooves, crunchy riffing, and trades-off a pair of unorthodox, shredding solos.<br /><br />So, there you have it. \\"Unto The Locust\\" is every bit the great album that \\"The Blackening\\" was. I am undecided as to whether or not this 2011 release trumps that 2007 one, but one thing is for certain: It definitely comes very, very close.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I still remember my family heading to the movie theater to watch this when it first came out, I don't think I've every laughed that hard during a movie.<br /><br />This has since become a family tradition ever Christmas. The Bluray looks awesome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it in one day. Can't wait to read the other two and find out what happens in the end.
B004BDJS9Q|3.0|This was a strange movie.  It was quite an interesting way of doing a movie which worked for the first half of the movie but got slightly tired towards the end.  I even felt myself dozing off during the last third of the movie and if I do that I know it has not held my attention well.  I guess a 42 year old woman is not it's target audience and perhaps it would go down better for a twenty something male watcher.  Not a bad movie but just has to be your thing to enjoy it.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|What a concept... a fantasy/western cross-over. I was so startled by the concept I bought the book (also, I had read and enjoyed Joe Abercrombie's previous books).<br /><br />By the time I was about a quarter of the way through the book I was getting worried. It was a bit more of a hard slog than I had been expecting. By the time I was halfway through the book I was hooked and roaring through it. So stick with it.<br /><br />This book is more story looking at the personalities of a handful of fascinating people rather than an epic story about momentous events. So it finishes with more of an &#34;oh&#34; rather than a &#34;WOW!&#34; But it really is a rollicking read. Recommend.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|i love my usb cable, i have no problems charging my kindle now and it does not take long to charge up my kindle. thank you so much for your support and for my usb cable.
0425263916|5.0|Great followup to Bared to You.  Can hardly wait till latest book which is due out in May.  Sylvia Day really knows how to<br />write.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|In my opinion, these are the best Batman movies ever. It is definitely cheaper to buy this set than to buy each movie separate. Each disk contains extra features and this set comes with a 60(+/-) page booklet about the making of the movie.<br />The sound and image quality is superb so if you are a Dark Knoght fan you will not be disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows ever! Be sure to watch every season....deserves 6 stars!<br />Like a zombie, hope it keeps coming back!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Love Grisham novels. A good read, not his best. Looking forward for his next book.. Ending was somewhat predictable this time.
0425263908|5.0|First book I bought by Sylvia Day.  Loved characters and fantastic story.  Second book, Reflected in You, was just as<br />great.  Can't wait for new one in this series to come out in May.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I checked out the reviews of this set before I bought it but when I saw it on a Gold Box deal I decided there was no reason to wait.  I frequent a site called blu-ray.com which has thorough and (in my experience) accurate reviews for most blu ray titles.  I fully agree with their assessment that the transfers were very well done and the picture was fantastic.  I viewed on a 70&#34; Sharp Aquos and found the quality to be stunning.<br /><br />Of course, the third and fourth movies are simply not nearly as good as the first two but that is also obviously something I knew before buying the set.
1849904251|5.0|Fantastic addition to anyone's Sherlock collection. Great tidbits of each episode and their characters. Enjoyed the snippits of insight from the creators. Would like more from them in the next series book. Their process merging the past and present is always interesting.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great sound, good solid construction and cable.  1/4 adapter screws onto phones instead of just plugging in (much safer connection).  A great pair of professional headphones.
B004U52VPS|5.0|they have way too much fun throwing the birds around its a fun activity and funny to watch. i do recomend this foer kids 5 and up
B008XG1X18|5.0|The experience I had with the Apple version of this app was not as good as I would have hoped.  It crashed a lot and was difficult to navigate.  But this Kindle version is so much easier to go through and it has never crashed on me which is a huge plus!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an amazing game. with over 101 games to unlock and play for free. its a great app and I'm addicted.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|She really wanted it. We got it for her. She will open it on Christmas morning. We know she will love ir.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have read a number of books about Lincoln over the years.  From Sandberg's six volume set to some more recent versions and compilations of his writings.  This one opened my eyes.<br /><br />I realized that I had internalized the widely accepted view of &#34;honest Abe&#34; as the great emancipator and kindly father figure, without really understanding the depth of his character.  Kearns Goodwin's book gives a riveting picture of his political skills, shrewd sense of timing and understanding of &#34;all the people&#34;.<br /><br />His handling of Salmon P Chase was amazing.  From his confirmation by the senate thru Chases numerous secretive schemes to further his own political ambitions and replace Lincoln on the ticket in 64, Lincoln somehow retained a balanced view of both his ability and selfish character.  The fact that he was aware of all Chase's machinations and still named him as the new Chief Justice of the Supreme Court vividly demonstrated Lincoln's overriding ability to rise above the fray and do what he thought would be best for the country.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|package arrived on time, one of lady a's best albums, I own it on itunes. bought as a christmas gift.
B005IS565S|5.0|I like the cd because it doesn't skip and I love the music. I've always liked heavy metal and rock music in general
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The story has several twist that you will not see coming that made the book and easy fast read. Highly recommend
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This was a great season. If you have watched the previous seasons, this season won't disappoint so go ahead and buy it!<br /><br />If your interested in this series, check out the other seasons first.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is full of interesting and useful information on gluten-free.  Really appreciated the in-depth info on wheat and gluten-free sources and products.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Great nerf product! Gift for my 10 yr old. He loves it. Easy to use and assemble. Stings a little, not good for real little kids.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was able to connect to my desktop and download all of my pictures. It was simple even for me. A must have accessory for the kindle fire.
0060899220|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is his honestly funny self on every page of this book.  If you want to know what really goes on behind the kitchen doors in your favorite restaurant, this would be the book for you...
B005K01VZS|5.0|I'd like to hear more about Henry´s church at the end of the book/timeline. Otherwise, awesome. Wonderful story of two faiths and their parallel developments.
0684803356|4.0|Great peek into a little known and brutal war, given to us by an author (Hemingway) who was as much a psychologist, historian and lover as he was author.  Bogs down just a bit in spots, but those spots can be skimmed over and the reader will still &#34;get&#34; the story.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this along with Cars II for our secret Santa family at work. I did not open it but it came quickly and was in great condition.
B004EPZ02A|5.0|good dvd no scratches picture looked good it wasn't as scary as the previous installments but the price was fair
0312020309|5.0|Since first reading James Herriot I was drawn to the richly told, heart-warming stories.  The characters he details almost seem to become real in the reading.  I have enjoyed each of the books from this series.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|love facebook. it's fun to be connected with friends and family and meeting new friends. having it connected to my phone is a great convince.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|this movie is awesome! anyone who gives it less then 5 stars just doesnt get it or didnt pay attention. it was made rock solid! constantine was 2 hours long and wish it was longer. everyone that was casted did a great performance. i couldnt get enough, A+ MOVIE.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|the movie is so much better than the first. very suspenseful and filled with a lot of action. not a bad price either
0312084986|5.0|Since first reading James Herriot I was drawn to the richly told, heart-warming stories.  The characters he details almost seem to become real in the reading.  I have enjoyed each of the books from this series.
0762445262|3.0|I bought this for a white elephant party and was relatively satisfied. In reading the other reviews I should have realized how small it really is. Only buy this if you don't plan on using the light, or if you shine it on a wall right next to it because it's not powerful at all.
B009JBZH54|5.0|i watched the whole batman triology and i was impressed @ the price that i paid. good deal. no complaints
B005KJZDXK|5.0|My fiance and I are big fans of Zooey Deschanel.  We were really excited to find out that she had released albums...especially this Christmas one!!<br /><br />The songs She and Him cover are classics already, but when they add their touch to them, the songs take on a new life of their own in my opinion!!<br /><br />I can't wait to get more She and Him albums.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Not owning any of the batmans, i decided to purchase this box set. I was pleased to see that it comes with digital copies of all the movies. You basically get 6 movies for the price of one. The box is beautifully made and the booklet does a great job showing favorite scenes from all the films.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I Am very surprised how good this movie was and how cheap it was. i see that alotta people didn't appreciate this movie @ first i thought the idea of the Abraham Lincoln Slaying vampires was going to be dumb i was wrong this movie is the s***. and the CG was top notch! this is a very good movie everybody should have this movie on MP4 or 3D-HD Blu-Ray
B001E454NY|5.0|My first impression is the same as the last one. A masterpiece now in HD! There's nothing more to say.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Found this via his touring mate, Ed Sheeran.<br /><br />It's a beautiful blend of acoustic with orchestral instrumentation and clever wordplay. If you enjoy more upbeat folk, this is right up your alley. He can get crass, but who doesn't nowadays. Worth a good few listens.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|this movie touched alot of base with the previous titles. will smith wasn't as funny as the last moives he was more serious and the new movie the guy that played as President Bush played the Perfect Agent K. this movie is a must have
B006LR0XLM|4.0|drag and drop interface couldn't be easier. uploads and downloads are as quick as can be expected and syncing is almost immediate across devices. my only complaint is they only give you 2gb free. sugarsync gives you 5 gb free. just saying. regardless, i installed it on my daughter's tablet. she is 10 and not the most technically gifted child in the world so i use dropbox to make it easy for her to get music or pictures on the tablet from the desktop computer, and tell her &#34;just move it into this box&#34;. she gets it.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I've seen this movie a hundred times and it never gets old. It outlines a zombiepocalipse with the only 4 remaining humans. It's a perfect mix of zombie movie with a comedy.
B007NRWLZ0|3.0|I love SPAWN alot and the animated series through the comics are just phenomal but the movie itself was just ok not the best but just an ok movie for what it was back in 1992 the storyline was awesome I just hope that somebody will bring back the anit-hero back on screen by the way there's a reboot but the date is still Unknown.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|My kids and I saw this movie at the theatre and I loved it so much we bought it.  It will be a welcomed addition to our Christmas movie collection.  I love the modern spin and the actors that do the voices are great. Very cute movie and appropriate for all ages.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Action. Drama. Comedy. Love story. Everything in one. Definitely worth the investment. It's nice having all these formats so that I can watch the movie in any situation. You won't be disappointed.
1616960922|5.0|I very much enjoyed this novelette. Very fascinating story and believable characters. The detailed plot get one reveted until the end.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It was okay until the update. Now it doesn't work at all. I didn't want to update, but I had to in order to play at all.
B008RC72G8|2.0|I grew up watching the series every day after school and this doe not do it justice. They took a great soap opera and tried to inject so much inuendo that it just isn't good. Save your money and buy the original show.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Brand new, still shrink-wrapped, and quick delivery. I haven't actually watched it, as it's a gift for a friend, but I am sure that the quality will be fantastic!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun and challenging!  It is also addicting, so be careful :) My four year old sister likes to play it and my 19 year old sister and my mom!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Disjointed and predictable. That's all I got, but the require 17 words so I'm writhing them here so it will go
B000W746GK|5.0|Brand new, still shrink-wrapped, and quick delivery. I haven't actually watched it, as it's a gift for a friend, but I am sure that the quality will be fantastic!
0345803485|5.0|For all those who write bad reviews I just don't get it, I loved this book in fact couldn't out it down! I read the trilogy bcuz I just couldn't stop. I am not a16 year old, I ask a grown married woman (almost 30). Great read for anyone who enjoys a love story
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This is the first Halestorm CD I have purchased and love every song on it!  This band rocks.  Highly recommended!
0142406112|5.0|My 9 year old son loved this book.  He even did his school book report on it.  Kind of a young James Bond type
1250006341|5.0|I am sure that my wife will love this as much as she has enjoyed watching the series on PBS.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's writing. It is funny, sensitive and a good read. Very entertaining and good to escape to.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Our hero, John Corey, and his wife are assigned to Yemen, the hotbed of terrorism. Many twists and turns, and several subplots all come together after a long journey. It does get a little tedious, and Corey's sense of humor is not quite as sharp, but the research for this book was the deepest.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was rely funny  I will recommend it to people how likes funny stuff and if you are in elementary and middle school I suggest this book to you
B009O2XY12|4.0|I find this game highly addictive. Although the fact that you only have so many unsuccessful goes before you run out helps me not play for too long!!<br />A fun game overall.
B007N85POS|5.0|I really Like this app. It's fun and entertaining. I enjoying playing it as well as my 4 years old grandson.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|It is nice to have a disney movie that isn't too princessy since I have a lot of nephews.  This movie was funny and heart warming.  Item arrived the next day.
0307887448|5.0|This book grabbed me almost right away and I couldn't stop. Anyone who has played an MMO like Warcraft will instantly get the avatar references and that's half the battle. The author makes it easy to imagine this world and immerse yourself in it. And if you are of the right time period and generation then you are going to get almost every reference. Some were a bit obscure for me but not worth haggling over. The overarching story is a bit tried and true. Stop an evil corporation from taking over the \\"world\\". But the character development is interesting. Nobody is as they seem. And it made me feel for them, that they couldn't bear themselves in the real world. A lot of the current generation can probably relate. If you watched Dark Crystal and Bladerunner when you were a kid and got hooked on sci-fi and fantasy, if you played old Commodore 64 or before games in computer lab in grade school and were addicted and still play video games as an adult, if you often dream about getting out of your own skin and making a new face and identity, then read this book!<br /><br />Two things. I want to live in the Oasis and I want to marry Art3mis. And I know I am a giant nerd for saying so, but I am who I am.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Such a good read. Starts off a bit slow, but stick with it and you will be rewarded with a story of hope, perseverance, faith and ingenuity.
B0012GMW7A|5.0|Leonard Cohan has always been one of the best artist in the wold and i was always suprised to find out some many people never heard of him so i was able to give this as a gift and now there is one more person who is in love with his music.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I don't know if it was the terrible title of this film, or the fact that Willis hasn't been in a good movie since the last Die Hard, but I went in thinking it was gonna be a at best so so Sci-Fi romp...not so.<br /><br />Solid action, good performances (the more I see Emily Blunt the more I like her) and a pretty good story, that does a good job distracting you from some of the illogic.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have the Alien series on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray DVD.  Blu-Ray has the best picture and sound.  I have a large Blu-Ray movie collection and needed the Alien Anthology to complete the set.
B000W089XS|4.0|I love old moives and I am so glad I found a place to get them. This a cute take on marring well.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good game for kids...just don't like how long it takes to unlock games and why games have to be unlocked...why cant they already be unlocked...
1451613512|5.0|I've been watching this series on Showtime and am glad that the perspectives of people like Howard Zinn [[ASIN:0805087443 A People's History of American Empire]], William Blum [[ASIN:1567512526 Killing Hope: U.S. Military and C.I.A. Interventions Since World War II--Updated Through 2003]], and Chalmers Johnson [[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]] are now reaching an even larger audience.<br />I would've liked more analysis of popular movements, such as the interesting role socialists have played in U.S. history [[ASIN:184467679X The \\"S\\" Word: A Short History of an American Tradition...Socialism]]; but, by and large, \\"The Untold History\\" is a much-needed break from the self-aggrandizing stories of the U.S. being a beacon of democracy and American \\"exceptionalism.\\"<br />I just caught Chapter 5 on Showtime, and it covered topics like the military industrial complex [[ASIN:B000FBH3W2 Why We Fight]] and U.S. intervention in Latin America [[ASIN:B003JUINFM The War on Democracy]].<br />For an even more in-depth analysis of U.S. policy around the world, people will want to check out the countless lectures and interviews of Noam Chomsky on YouTube.  I'd particularly recommend the Chomsky debate with Richard Perle, the Bill Moyers interview with Chomsky, the BookTV \\"In-Depth with Noam Chomsky\\" video, and Chomsky's lecture based on this book [[ASIN:0374523495 Deterring Democracy]].<br />Lastly, another world is possible, as the website and the pages of this magazine show [[ASIN:B00006L2TG Yes!]].
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Makes artwork....and photos easy to enhance..enjoy the hours spent with this app. Use it for enhancing photos but love the sketchpad drawing capability!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This app is worth every penny. The game was long, intriguing, a challenging.  very good job. cant wait for part two.
B000NTPDSW|1.0|The DVD jacket came damaged and torn, I am very disappointed that Amazon actually shipped this to me in the condition that they did. I don't buy many DVDs anymore due to the extremely digital world we now live in, but this is a classic and I wanted it in Bluray. Unfortunately this is probably the last time I purchase DVDs from Amazon. (Hard to believe right?)
B0086700CM|4.0|if your the type of person who likes fast moving and action games this is the game for you it is a good game but the only problem is that when you jump (somtimes) it wil just freeze and otherwise is a good game and fun to play but it takes forever!!!!! to load!!!!!!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|As a series, it's great. Due to some dispute (look it up online), the seasons after 3 use this cheesy intro and outro music replacing the standard &#34;Love and Marriage&#34; theme. It's annoying and understandable given copyright laws, but it's a good thing there are chapters so you can skip over them.
B000PKG7I4|1.0|The CD holder is in a sealed sleeve.  All I can assume is that a CD is enclosed.  Hopefully the correct CD is within the case and that it is unused
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game was vary cool and it is really cool and I think it is really fun and cool to play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing. Must read number 3 asap!!!! So interesting and what a cliff hanger ending! I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B009AZZEU2|3.0|Haven't listen to it yet... but will update when the gift gets opened. But I think my husband will love it
B000085RPU|3.0|Its a region 1 so I couldnt play it on my ps3! I noticed later since I didnt know what it was.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought that the overall feel I got from this intense story plot was more than less described as perfection.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Exelent music Woah this is super super super great!!! I mean wow! the game is challenging (in a good way) its worth the monney! buy it NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005DI66N4|5.0|This was a great book and an amazing story.  These people persevered under amazing circumstances.  I would highly recommend reading this story.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Surprisingly good movie.  I didn't expect it to be this good.  I liked the special effects and the growth of the main character.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Simply an awesome movie - I would highly recommend as its both entertaining and enlighting since the difference between an incredible life and a normal life lies within the mind.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great show, good acting, good special affects. As I said, bummed it was not picked up for more seasons!<br />Hoping someone will rescue it, but, probably too late now. :-(
1451673442|5.0|Having been someone who has consistently battled chronic depression (and having been on every type of anti-depression medication while trying \\"techniques\\" in depression books) I can tell you that following the strategies in The Magic will help you overcome any anxiety, depression, sadness, or loss of hope that you may have in your life.<br /><br />I'm a pretty successful person on a financial level.  I've always done really well in business and in investing.<br /><br />However, I've always suffered on a personal level with family/friends and with battling depression.  In fact, not only have I not been successful in those arenas but I can honestly say that I've been a dismal failure.<br /><br />I've tried \\"overcoming depression\\" books and I've run the gamut with anti-depression medications.  Those remedies just mask the problem.  They don't actually overcome it.<br /><br />While reading The Magic and slowly (and quite easily...almost effortlessly) began implementing the very basic and easy-to-understand strategies presented, I INSTANTLY began to feel better...about everything.  Mind you, beforehand I had found myself slipping deeper and deeper into a \\"gloomy\\" state of mind, thinking perhaps I was going into a midlife crisis (at the age of 38...go figure) wondering...is this it?  Because if it is, this really blows!<br /><br />I didn't pick up this book to \\"change my life\\" or anything like that.  I really didn't know why I got this book except that maybe I was intrigued by the description and the other reviews of this book.  I read the book with an open mind, beginning to follow the exercises immediately upon reading the first chapter.<br /><br />I instantly began to feel uplifted.  I felt hope and a desire to do things in my life that I've long forgotten about or chalked off as a \\"waste of time\\" to bother with.<br /><br />Within just a few days of feeling this uplifted \\"church-like\\" feeling, I realized that it was my own weighty, heavy thoughts I was throwing needlessly upon myself that was pushing me down into a depression.  Now, don't get the wrong idea.  This isn't some \\"positive thinking\\" clap-trap type of self-help book.  This goes BEYOND positive thinking because I didn't have to force myself to say, \\"Don't think that negative thought, Monica, focus on what you can be grateful for.\\"  Instead, I automatically pushed away the negative thoughts that were bringing me down immediately as they entered my mind in an automatic \\"I-don't-have-time-for-this\\" type of fashion.<br /><br />And this is way different than how I have been thinking my entire life!<br /><br />After a week of going through the exercises, I found myself bouncing out of bed and having this exciting feeling in the pit of my stomach that I didn't remember having in a long time.  It's that exciting feeling that I remember having when I was a kid, maybe right before Christmas or going to an exciting place.<br /><br />And I feel this way all the time now!  How amazing and awesome is that?!<br /><br />So, I can't say that I've experienced \\"miracles\\" in the physical world such as a pile of money coming my way or winning the lottery because it didn't happen that way.  Instead, I got a much greater gift out of the deal!  I truly got The Magic back in my life...child-like magic that I've long forgotten about.  And it's back making me excited about life, energetic, and giving me my \\"groove\\" back.<br /><br />One thing I do have to say on the \\"business\\" side of this is that because I've gotten this Magic in my life, I have found that my businesses are \\"taking care of themselves\\" since I've lost the daily stress and anxiety I've had over every detail of both my businesses.  And because I now have a renewed interest in \\"life\\" while being excited about going to the office everyday, I have been blessed with new creative ideas for marketing, products, and managing my operations that I would have never dreamed of getting before (since I was sunk so low in a cesspool of depression).  One business that I wanted to drop is automatically dropping away while the other I have a stronger interest in is really starting to take off.  This is something I've been trying to forcefully line up for years and it's now taking care of itself automatically now that I have \\"let go\\" of the process.<br /><br />If you're a business person and you feel trapped, get this book.  If you want to make any major life change but don't know how and need guidance, get this book.  If you are battling depression and pills, books, and shrinks aren't helping, get this book.<br /><br />I should mention too that I didn't do all the exercises in The Magic as Rhonda Byrnes mentions.  I don't care for sitting in a corner writing out my thoughts in a journal.  I type 85 WPM and my handwriting is slow (and sucks) plus I don't have the time to commit to that part of the process so I don't do that part of the exercises as she suggests.  As long as I \\"feel\\" the gratitude deeply, genuinely, and joyfully as she addresses in her books, The Magic is working.<br /><br />I can see how using this book with the book [[ASIN:B001QOGJRC Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting: The Astonishing Power of Feelings]] can truly change your life on both spiritual and financial levels at the same time since they both talk about feeling those \\"feelings\\" at the pit of your stomach to start changing the universal energy around you (and thus changing your life in the directions you want to go).<br /><br />Great stuff!  Highly recommended!).  One business that I wanted to drop is automatically dropping away while the other I have a stronger interest in is really starting to take off.  This is something I've been trying to forcefully line up for years and it's now taking care of itself automatically now that I have \\"let go\\" of the process.<br /><br />If you're a business person and you feel trapped, get this book.  If you want to make any major life change but don't know how and need guidance, get this book.  If you are battling depression and pills, books, and shrinks aren't helping, get this book.<br /><br />I should mention too that I didn't do all the exercises in The Magic as Rhonda Byrnes mentions.  I don't care for sitting in a corner writing out my thoughts in a journal.  I type 85 WPM and my handwriting is slow (and sucks) plus I don't have the time to commit to that part of the process so I don't do that part of the exercises as she suggests.  As long as I \\"feel\\" the gratitude deeply, genuinely, and joyfully as she addresses in her books, The Magic is working.<br /><br />I can see how using this book with the book [[ASIN:B001QOGJRC Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting: The Astonishing Power of Feelings]] can truly change your life on both spiritual and financial levels at the same time since they both talk about feeling those \\"feelings\\" at the pit of your stomach to start changing the universal energy around you (and thus changing your life in the directions you want to go).<br /><br />Great stuff!  Highly recommended!

B0028R3NCU|2.0|Pros;<br />It's smaller than other card readers<br />It works just fine<br /><br />Cons;<br />Easy to lose<br />The memory card is too loose inside the card reader. It feels like the card may fall.

B006RXPUR2|4.0|Ben Affleck and his brother do their part well. Good story coupled with good direction makes this film definitely one time watch. Although don't expect an edge of the seat cinema experience. Good to watch if you like slow paced good movies.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Deep characters, outstanding plot, just a great all around show. Its my favorite show/movie by far! If you love gladators, violence, and revenge give this a watch!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great Story, Characters, Cinematography, Direction, you name it. You become a part of the crew. Can't recommend this show enough!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|this game is very very easy. I put it on the largest ones and played through about half the levels and the paths are mostly clear immediately after looking at the dot locations. Its mediocre fun but really the simplistic design and the lack of difficulty made me delete this game soon after downloading it
B0053O89KG|5.0|I purchased this for my wife for Christmas this year.  My wife got me hooked on this TV show.  The more you watch it the more you want to see.  It it a very good show that gives you comedy, drama and suspense every time.  I can't wait to see what they will do on the next show and yes I did purchase seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4.

B00632HWOG|1.0|Like many of you - I am beyond frustrated about the new Yahoo mail app.  I rely heavily on this app for my business and the functionality of being able to receive emails without having to go look for them is key.  Now none of my emails are pushed through nor do I get an audible alert.  Does anyone know if or when Yahoo is planning to post an update?  How would I/we go about finding out?
B000AARKOO|5.0|If you love crusader/midevil movies youll like this one. Its done very well, good story and good pacing. No dull moments and good action scenes!
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Too often we find ourselves left with old, tired, sub-par performances by rock bands that haven't been good since the mid '70's. Led Zeppelin reunited for one night and proved that none of their peers are on their level. Must have.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun! Its nice that its free and no obligation to make purchases in the cash shop.
B004FXNSAW|4.0|Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is not a fan of robots and on the surface looks like he does not believe they are as benign as advertised.  The top inventor of the robots Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) commits suicide (presumably). He leaves a message that has Spooner assigned to the investigation. Why Spooner?<br /><br />Spooner gets suspicious and will not leave the suicide lie. Naturally his boss Lt. John Bergin (Chi McBride) says drop it. The head of the robotics firm says drop it. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) knows he is crazy and says drop it. Even his own mother says drop it.<br /><br />V.I.K.I. (Fiona Hogan) is mistrustful of Spooner's motives.<br />So does Spooner finally come to his senses and drop it?<br />Is he paranoid or are his suspicions founded?<br /><br />This is definitely a Will Smith vehicle with a few CGI robots thrown in. The title of course came from a Robert Heinlein novel. From here we have all the standard clich&eacute; and scenarios as a boss who does not believe the same and kowtows to authority, an obvious bad guy, a girl that puts her foot in everyone mouth, standard red herrings, and much more.<br /><br />Still this is great fun and Will makes the movie. There are plenty of &quot;action&quot; scenes, &quot;stay in the car&quot; scenes, &quot;shower&quot; scenes, &quot;chase&quot; scenes, and even cliffhangers.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0553803700 I, Robot (Bantam Spectra Book)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000G1O30G I, Robot By Isaac Asimov (Hardcover)]]
0446554995|1.0|The only thing this latest Preston and Child bomb is good for is recycling:  when you run low on toilet paper, here are 480 sheets.  A big, big disappointment.
B00915G6YE|5.0|What made this season so believable, was performance. Especially for Jennifer Carpenter,(Deb)- who made the plot truly believable through her amazing performance as she comes to terms with her brothers darkest secret. So many things happening this season, plot twists, mafia, crazy video game guy, and the mysterious Hannah. And it all comes together tightly.<br /><br />The season finales ending stumped me. What happened? There's a huge gap at the end.<br />But...that's whats so fantastic about this series, its ability to engross you, no matter how close Dex gets to getting his.<br /><br />And what does Dex really think about his \\"code\\" now?<br /><br />Enticing as always.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Keeps the reader on the edge of their chair as the author dashes around the plot.  Lots of intrigue and suspense!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Loved this movie!! It was so funny! It is not your typical Disney Princess movie! Such a great role model for young girls!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I usually don't read books like this, but I'm so glad i read this one. It was beautiful and touching and i laughed and cried and smiled and fell in love while reading this book.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I wish I'd done my research before buying these:  they were a costly waste.  As it is, I will never by a turtle beach product again.  Why?<br /><br />There are known issues with static and these earphones: with no other sounds or gameplay going the static sounds through the earphones are slightly louder than the microwave running in your kitchen. This is constant and probably damaging to your ears.  The static occurs whether with a ps3 or used on a laptop or with anything.<br /><br />There are lots of posts about this with supposed workarounds and nothing works.  I really wish I hadn't tossed out the packaging before using this product.  I strongly encourage you to avoid as enough people mention the issue for it to be a problem known to turtle beach or an example of extremely poor quality control.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i just wish its free but its not and that sucks but there is no way im paying five bucks for it
0805090665|4.0|Its not as great as the other books, but its still a good book and the kids enjoy another version of their work.
0671646788|5.0|If you have been stuck in a rut and you know you deserve more, this is the book that will help you get started! I would recommend this book to anyone who is tired of thinking that success has somehow passed them by. Great things happen to the right people for all the right reasons. Be one of those people!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Love them. I always used the over the whole ear headphones, my last pair were Pioneer ( I cant spell ), and i have owned KOSS and Panisonic. But these are featherlike and have great sound.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Whatever you do don't get this app! It tells you ages that are not close to your age! I am only 9 and it said I was 41 48 and 32!!! It takes up a lot of room on your device!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A thorough understanding of his life and what he has contributed to the world.  He may not have pleased everyone, but he did things his way and optimized his time on Earth.  A great, revealing read
B007I1QUYE|5.0|It came Individually packaged in the condition it was advertised in. No complaints. Look forward to giving it to my sister for Christmas.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|A great book full of tips and tricks for mastering how to properly expose an image.  You'll want to go out and buy a tripod if you don't already have one since much of the book will show you that you'll probably need one under some more difficult lighting scenarios with longer exposures.  I learned a lot from this book that I haven't seen elsewhere in articles
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|amazing! this book drew me in and left me wanting the rest of the series right now. this is a new author to watch for

B00005JM02|5.0|This is such a funny and cute flick. It was a movie for all ages, but definitely an entertaining one.
0321885112|5.0|Capturing ideas and then communicating them with as little effort as possible is one of the most effective skills to have in today's world. Mike Rohde nailed it when explaining how to turn simple notes into visual ideas that can be shared, remembered and put into action. Simple communication is my lifeline and The Sketchnote Handbook is the manual for making it happen.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|This is such a funny flick. It may not be appropiate for the young ones (there is a bit of language), but definitely an entertaining one.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I much say, it's an excellent movie.  Action packed as all of Vin's movies. The cast was excellent.  It was so good, I watched it 3 times in 24 hours.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|I've seen this movie many times and could watch it many times again. I bought this for my future daughter-in-law. I'm not so sure my son is thrilled, he's afraid he'll have to watch it many times with her. :D
B000BW7QWW|3.0|Some parts made sense, but other I didn't grasp (to be honest I think it was just me).  I think this movie is more for the younger generation.
B00867GJYK|5.0|I already have this movie and bought it for my future daughter-in-law. She's starting her own Disney library for the future.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Excellent excellent game!!! Definitely keeps me busy when I am bored and need to stay awake. Great time passer when at the doctors office.
159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher, is about a high school girl, Hannah, who has an undeserved and discrimating reputation. The book starts out with the school discovering that she has committed suicide and no one truly understands why. Before she took her life, she recorded tapes of herself explaining why she did this and who motivated this tragic decision. Each tape is dedicated to one person who influenced her life so drastically that they contributed to her death. Except the person listening to the tapes has no idea how he could have hurt her, in fact he has been secretly in love with her for years. Listening to Hannah's tapes is torturing him, but he keeps listening because he needs to understand why she took such extreme measures to end her pain and suffering.<br /> This eye-opening book truly puts the reader into Hannah's shoes. It is a great book for any high school student, although girls would much prefer it than boys, to realize how much their seemingly harmless actions can change a person's life forever. This book obviously is centered around suicide and how high school students treat one another, so it can be very relatable to some people, but some may find it a bit upsetting.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|Excellent movie! Very humorous with a great message for young people. I would recommend it for all Families.The music is great, too!!
0060555661|5.0|An excellent book which, in a simple language, familiarizes you with the market. Beneficial even for those who are a finance professional already.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Great movie! Lovable characters and very funny! Excellent modern twist to an old fairytale. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone!
034580404X|5.0|I ordered the trilogy because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about and so glad I did. I finished book 1 in a few days and have started on book 2. They have not disappointed and I would recommend these to any woman who loves a good love story with a bit of kinkiness thrown in.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is a classic movie in our family.  It's a good balance of the comedic and the dramatic, and shows the evolution of a son's attitude toward his father's proclivity for exaggerated storytelling.  The cinematography is simply beautiful.
0525953728|5.0|This product was exactly what I needed for my mother's gift! The price was very reasonable and was shipped promptly, I am very pleased and would buy from this seller again.

B000V6U846|5.0|Bob Marley and the Wailers live is powerful stuff!!  I highly recommend this live album to any Bob Marley lover!
0553801473|5.0|I've read every book in this series 2 or 3 times. I can't get enough of it. The only bad part is waiting for the next one to come out.
0345803485|3.0|While the story itself is about as believable as the Easter Bunny, it is entertaining and I found it hard to put the book down. It really is a page turner if you ignore the authors constant repetition of both words and phrases. After the main character's subconscious is described with the word \\"harpy\\" for 15th time, I was ready to put the book down, but since I am not a quitter, I just decided I'd warn YOU! Due to the repetition, it would seem that the author lacks in the vocabulary department, so it seems odd when she randomly scatters dictionary-worthy SAT words in the text. It feels almost as though she used the MS-Word thesaurus and chose synonyms just to try to raise the reading level. Sorry, throwing a big word here and there doesnt make one worthy of being being called a good writer.<br />Will I read the next 2? Of couse. I want to know how the story ends. If there werent such graphic sex scenes and such an abusive relationship, the story would be better off as young adult level.
0857685848|5.0|Excellent imagines based on best guesses of what dinosaurs actually looked like.  Great for the young paleontologist in your family.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|&lt;SPOILER ALERT> Too bad Mad Men lost the Emmy to the timely Homeland. In my humble opinion, this was by far its best season yet. We had the always-astonishing Roger tripping his a** off on LSD - and in the process getting out of another loveless marriage. Joan's sudden, troubling personal affairs that lead her to make exasperatingly difficult, life-altering decisions. Betty (who would have thought it?) battling a weight problem paired with her eccentric (to put it mildly) Mother-in-Law, a fascinating character, without an empathetic bone in her body. She's so detached. Is it elitism or something much more nefarious like the onset of dementia? The profoundly sad downfall of Lane, not before giving Pete the punch in the nose that he's had coming for years. Then the kicker final scene - Don's transcendentally styled departure from his new wife - he walked -literally- right past the camera and seemingly out of her new career, and life; tremendously brave direction that worked on every level. Will Don acquiesce to a lovely young woman's advances in a cocktail lounge?<br /><br />Congratulations to the talented group of writers, actors and others behind the scene that pulled this season together. It seems like an eternity before Season Six arrives. The good news is we all have these archives at our disposal!<br /><br />The bonus gallery, commentary, short features and the Canadian Club recipes complete the package.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|Fun, quick gameplay, simple, intuit ive and responsive controls and none of those garbage permissions. That's what a game should be like. I got it here as FAOTD, but I'll probably get it over at G00gle too, since the Amzns Appstore keeps crashing my newer devices.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Wont start, claims I have no space left... Like this game but cant even play it. Need this fixed. Sadface.
B008ALAHA4|3.0|It works, but really should have been included with the MacBook Pro that requires it. I hope it doesn't fall apart as quickly as Apple's power supplies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie..it was good...however a lot of info was left out. But that is understandable due to time constraints. Very easy to read. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The best t.v. Series ever, the photography, music, scenery, characters are outstanding.  The story line is very good.  So much of t.v. Is disappointing in these times.
0307352145|2.0|Nice attempt to make the introverts feel better, but do not expect breathtaking insights. The best part of the book are the first chapters - the analysis of the society's preference for extroversion
B003WUYRGI|4.0|it was a good book i luv it bit i want something betta like thongs on fire book but goodbye
B008B7OQHM|5.0|This is a classic. I got more then I thought I would when buying this item. It has some really awesome stuff from SlipKnot on it.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The electrical connection at the usb end is a little mechanically weak. Make sure in storage and in use you don't bend the cable too much right at the end!
B008PNBU30|5.0|Another great CD from Three Days Grace!! These guys know no wrong. The single &#34;Chalk Outline&#34; has been a huge hit for Months before the LP came out. I love it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have all four of Susan Boyle's albums, and like the first three a lot, especially the first, but this one, &#34;Standing Ovation&#34; is the best so far in my opinion. There's something in her voice and interpretations that goes right to the heart. I am not usually given to tears when listening to music, but Susan Boyle touches me because she's real. Even with the new glamor and the London Philharmonic accompanying her, she is true to herself and grateful for the help she's been given to arrive at this place. Her wish to &#34;be a professional singer&#34; has come true. I wish her many more years of successful albums to inspire and move us. Her success is truly deserved.
B007X4N0DU|5.0|POD is back!!! This LP is great. Sounds like where they left off back in the 90s. It is all over the Radios!!
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann's singing is visceral. He is a tenor who can sound like a baritone or a heldentenor. His voice quality is thrilling and he can soar up to a high C with freedom and power. And it doesn't hurt that he is handsome and can act. He can sing in many languages with the accents of a native. He speaks with intelligence and knowledge when he is interviewed - in a word, he has it all. And I hear that he is a &#34;nice guy&#34; as well.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|The best TV/Cable show of 2012. I can't believe at all of the people that watch this show on a regular basis. I love it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|As far as a useful, real, everyday, application; this has been the one that has been a game changer for me!  big and bright, the display is easy to see.  Leaving the charger hooked up enables the app to stay open, and leaves your Kindle fully charged the next day.  It also has lots of features like playing you to sleep with your choice of music, and waking you up with your choice; or using the large library of sounds that come with the app.<br />Easily 5 stars!
B00122KV5O|5.0|Great like all of her other stuff. I was so glad she put this out. I have a few of her 1st few CDs but lost touch with her. She put out some cool stuff along with her hits are on this CD
B0062O85IW|2.0|Without an index or search function this is VERY difficult to use in digital format. I'm going to order the paper version (which has a searchable .pdf disk), then return this digital copy.
B007CMD5EC|5.0|This is a great CD. It is like a project CD for John 5. He is such a great guitarist
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app it is my favorite app out there and its free!!! don't let those heaters out there get you to not use it. the only downside to it at all is the amount of storage the videos take up and its not even that bad.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Maybe one of the best action sequels ever. I loved the Dark Knight and now with Rises out it is even better for the 1st movie. I have watched (along with the new one)  many times over. I catch something different each time it seems.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is straight from the heart music. Macklemore put his all into this and it shows! I am so impressed with his style and the fact that he stood strong and didn't sell out to the industry. Can't wait for more from him! <3<3<3
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this. Always find great ideas for everything on here. Have recommended this to several people and have been following people.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have not had much of a chance to play, but my 6 year old nephew has played through it (he is an Angry Birds Ace) and says it is his favorite Angry Birds Game.  And it looks great on HD on the Fire.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I guess most movies buff had had already watch this movie numerous times and knows that this is a fantastic action thriller as you will be rooting Liam Neeson character to get the bad guy all throughout the show. The only gripe I have is the damn flimsy blu ray box(casing) that the disc comes with it. It's so thin and when I received it, both discs are un-lodged from its tray !!! Luckily Blu ray disc are not prone to scratch  easily (unlike the digital/DVD copy that this copy comes with) Anyway, this movie comes highly recommended.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This movie was great. I remember the org. and this is not it, it's played for laughs and sur got a lotof them. I would recommend this movie to all my friends who love Johnny Depp.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|I first saw Diana Krall when she was a rather pudgy and unknown talent from Canada at the Women's Jazz Festival at Dc's Kennedy Center in the late 80s/early 90s. She was a rocking pianist, still is, but has gotten into the hands of producers who slicken up her music too much for my taste. Still, I'll listen and support her.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Another great album for these wonderful, women.  The music is very entertaining and the words are easily understood.  A nice compliment.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is a great concert.  High energy and wonderful quality for a live concert.  This is one you can watch over and again.
B000WCDI64|5.0|I lke this concert. Never listen to any of her music before. totally enjoyed it.I think anyone that likes jazz or r an b will like!
B001P06GX4|5.0|My son saw this game and wanted it so we finally gave in and got it for him. It is oddly a really fun game.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Often listed among the best live rock albums, &#34;Strangers in the Night&#34; is a classic performance from UFO that takes you back in time.  The clear music lines, the hard rhythms, the euro-rock progressiveness of the 70's are all on display.  So much of what we came to love in metal, radio rock, and even popular music can tie itself back to these tunes and these performances.  UFO will never get the credit they deserve in the mainstream, but among those who lived it and heard it, we will always know their contributions to the music we were immersed in as teens.
141659521X|5.0|This was a very quick read.  I couldn't put it down.  I hope you enjoy it a much as I did.

1401309666|5.0|The ideas introduced in this book are revolutionary. A lot of the concepts we take for granted because they've become ingrained in our culture, but having them explained opens your eyes to what you've seen but never noticed. This is a masterpiece and I hope history judges it that way. MUST READ.
0547260695|5.0|The book is AMAZING!!!! definitely beyond expectations! the only thing... was a little wrinkled... so it looked like used, but when you open it is speechless!
0307720950|4.0|This book gave me a peek into a world I knew existed, but had no idea of the potential. Definitely worth reading immediately.<br /><br />My only fear about this book is that it won't be relevant in 3-4 years.... I don't think anything else would make Chris Anderson so happy.
B000FC10HA|2.0|The substance of this book would make a great blog post. I am a bit disappointed to have to spend the price of a book for the wisdom a few fortune cookies.
B000SZHH30|3.0|It's an ok album, but if you're looking to find out what Phoenix is about then check out Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix and leave this one for another time.
0783226063|5.0|Bought this used and it played perfectly.  I've loved the movie for some time now.  I read the book and had to watch this again.  If you like Scifi, this is a great movie.  It focuses more on interplanetary espianage, political intrigue, and religious intertwinings than on lasers or funny looking aliens.  Highly recommended.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son's birthday. Of course I took the time to read this book as I have read bits of his previous work. This book is funny and keeps my children entertained with the humor. I have to say that I didn't find this as funny as the previous books, but it did make me laugh. I would say to go ahead and buy it for your children as it is always great to have all the books in the series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it<br />It is likable it<br />I think it's awe as awesomely awesomeness I like it  an incredible game better than beating off
B009KYXEY6|2.0|I loved the fact that it had &#34;born to die&#34; and her new &#34;paradise&#34; cd as a 2-CD set. VERY disappointed that 3 songs weren't on it that claimed to be especially for the price I paid. I returned it....may re-order when the problem is fixed.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love being able to put puzzles together without all the mess and hassle. it a great game. love the variety of pictures to do and being able to select how many pieces the puzzles are.

B0013F1D02|5.0|This is one of our all time favorite movies.  It's the perfect blend of an epic story, romance and comedy.  It will have you laughing and crying and just leave you feeling great.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The action was good, the plot well thought  out and very realistic. Although, there is some extensive technical discussions on cyber warfare, the technology is not overbearing going on for entire chapters as in earlier Clancy novels. Looking forward to the new one next year
B004TE7BBO|1.0|Book was intended as a gift ,has a black slash in ink on it  . Would like to return it
B008JFUTT0|5.0|It is really a tragedy that Rodriguez's music was lost to the U.S. for over 40 years.  Thank you to the individuals from South Africa who sought him out and brought him back.  The beauty of it all is that Rodriguez is still alive to see what a difference he made in the lives of thousands of South African individuals.
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie, maybe thats how i set myself up, i was thinking this would be along the lines of \\"the bourne identity\\" , but all the flash backs grew a little too tiring. Sure i can handle a few, but through out the entire movie? Sure the fight scenes were great, and i think they banked too much on that. I found myself thinking okay she's in trouble but its a flash back, so that kinda destroyed the film for me along with the phrase \\" get to the point \\", with a great cast this was a bust of a movie which was sad. If you got money to burn or want to just build your collection, then buy this, but buyer beware.
B00632HWOG|5.0|needed amazon's email app setup before contacts appeared in this app.  lot of new commands in the new app. like it

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Katie decides to start her life over when she moves to the town of Southport in North Carolina. She barley has any money and has a difficult time finding a job to make a living off of. She becomes very good friends with a small storeowner, Kevin, and his children and ends up spending lots of time with them. While she's enjoying her life a part of her past that she tries to leave behind comes to haunt her. The theme of family is intertwined with the theme of love in Katie's life.<br />I would recommend this book for any girl ages eighteen and up. It is like many of Nicholas Sparks' other novels because it is a love story, but I think it is his best novel yet. It is very intense and you won't want to put it down.

B005LAIHZY|4.0|Just simply one of the best animated movies we have seen. Great story, characters, animation and music.<br />Already watched it twice, and showing no signs of stopping.<br /><br />Well Done Pixar !!
0425263916|5.0|Love this series.  She continues the excitement of the first novel & I finished it in 2 days.<br />How can you not love Gideon & Ev?  I will say I liked the 1st book better & was a little surprised about the ending, however the reading is fast-paced & sexy.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This was an excellent buy if you are into the show. Came in a nice compact case. Cannnot wait for the next season.
1401924352|3.0|Out of all the inspirational books I have, this one did nothing for me. Yes it's 'pretty' but it's SO topical in it's treatment of becoming a better you and loving yourself. It had so much potential but just didn't go DEEP enough, all the things in here I already knew, and I am sorry but the writing just wasn't very good (sorry Miranda!). Also, as a warning, half the book is just inspirational quotes (literally half--one quote per page...) honestly I felt a tad ripped off, I was hoping this book would be more 'enlightening' or original. Oh well, I would return the product if I could. But then the message on the cover is lovely, &#34;Treasure yourself&#34; but that's all I really got out of it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm sad that the series is over, I couldn't stop reading from book one. I will definitely recommend this series to everyone.
0596007124|1.0|I purchased this book based on the strength of its high review scores. I'll be more careful in the future and spend time reading the negative reviews as well. I find this style of teaching to be tedious and distracting. I much prefer teaching that is brief and to the point.<br /><br />As someone has already pointed out - you'll either love it or hate it.
B005XI9456|3.0|Bieber is not one of my favorite musicians but I can deal with him. I was disappointed that almost every song was a cover. How about some original music?
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book because the dog is telling the story and it gives you insight to how dogs think.  I gave it four stars because I felt some of the storyline was predictable like a fairy tale but still worth the read

B0087JTAKW|4.0|Loved it. Another thought provoking book from Mitch. It just seemed a little rushed at the end. Great read though
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I was not impressed with the overall functioning of this app. It was difficult to navigate and limited in the functionality and compatibility.
0743270754|5.0|I bought this book after watching the recent Spielberg film &#34;Lincoln&#34; (which I found very impressive). Apparently I did not pay much attention in school, because most of this history was relatively unknown to me, and I therefore found this book to be completely fascinating. Having read Donald's excellent biography of Lincoln (which I also highly recommend), there was indeed some overlap, and there are incidents in Donald's biography that are covered better there than they are here. That is no problem, however -- the two books are complementary, which is just what you would want.<br /><br />What makes this book different to Donald's, and others, is that Doris Kearns Goodwin focuses not just on Lincoln but on the cast of characters around him -- in particular Seward, Chase, Stanton and Bates. Therefore, it isn't quite appropriate to see this as &#34;just another Lincoln biography.&#34; It's really a book about all five of these men and their relationships. But in fact, it is much more than that, because unlike some other biographers, Goodwin also looks closely at the lives of the women in these men's lives -- Seward's wife Frances and Chase's daughter Kate emerge as particularly interesting and strong characters who played a significant role in the turn of events -- albeit from a completely different angle to that of the men.<br /><br />Much of the history is not really political history at all, since Goodwin provides so much detail on the lives of her characters that the book is just as much cultural history. At times this can almost get tedious, when we read about what kind of shopping one of the women did that season, or all the correspondence between Chase and his daughter on various matters, and so on. But at the same time, I felt that this did serve to give the reader a real window into the social and cultural life of the times, and that is no doubt extremely valuable. I found the first 150-200 pages to be a bit slow, as the author winds up to the nomination of Lincoln, but after that the pace picks up quite a bit and the book becomes even more enthralling.<br /><br />Overall, I am greatly appreciate to Goodwin for having written such a remarkable and readable account. She is a very fair-minded writer and tries to be even-handed. What emerges is a detailed and intriguing portrait of a cast of truly remarkable men and women, and I am grateful to her for bringing that to us. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in this time period.

B0002Z9XFQ|1.0|i have watched this in the past and wanted to see it again. Unforfunately I could not because the format was different than what is seen here in  the US. The format of the film is (U) for universal, in the US we have NTSC. They aren't compatible. The end.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought Alien Anthology [Blue-ray] for the REAL low price of 19.99.  It got here in less than 2 days. What a deal! Each movie except for Alien: Resurection had original release and a director's cut. There were two bonus discs that talked at lenght of just about every aspect of the movies such as set construction, casting, how they got Weaver to come back for three sequels, interviews with H.R. Giger, etc...<br />  Also when changing discs Weyland Corporation logo apears on screen till the next disc is loaded taking less time for you marathon lovers.  All the discs are in a booklet which is really nice with stil shots in between the pages.  This is an excellent value and I don't think this can be topped unless I can get all six Star Wars episodes on Blue-ray for 19.99
B006H5120E|5.0|I like this picture. It is now in 3D- Amazing to see in 3D. Quality of Blue-ray 3D is great! Received the product on time and in good condition.

B0053O89WY|5.0|This show continues to amaze and amuse me. The characters are so consistently themselves that this show never disappoints. I have loved all the seasons but the finale of this one beats out all the other seasons together.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I have seen this movie several times in the past and it is my favorite musical.  After watching it on Amazon Prime recently I decided that I wanted to own it in case it ever became unavailable on the internet.  When I received it in the mail I popped it in the DVD player, just to be sure that it worked okay, with no intention of watching the whole thing again. Glad I didn't have anything pressing to do for the next hour or so! From the opening strands of music I was hooked, as was my wife when she happened by. We've been singing snippets of the songs ever since.  Sure hope someone notices that I put the CD on my want list for Christmas.

B004U52VPS|3.0|stupid design. Not easy for a kid. spent a lot of time to build up.<br />but still usable<br />not a good choice
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I wish when I bought the DVD, the version I get would have the deleted scenes, commentary and all the extra things that are normally included.  If you don't have Blu Ray and are questioning the validity of the quality?  Remember what you said when you went from your old tube TV to your HD and how impressed you were at that step up?  IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT!

0525953728|5.0|This book is a quick read and captures all the pertinent details about finally taking Bin Laden to meet St Peter.  Where UBL was undoubtedly disappointed to find out that there were in fact no virgins waiting for him, but instead found out that he would remain in a very hot, tortuous place of unending anguish for eternity.  This author gives genuine details that only a SEAL could know...couldn't put it down.  He also makes it very clear that our current rules of engagement under the Obama administration make it obvious that the US needs to get the heck out of Afghanistan, yesterday.

1573226521|3.0|I agree with many of the commenters that, while Alex Garland is a very good writer, this story left me scratching my head at its lack of conclusiveness.  There's no achoring theme or conclusory message to this tale. Although it was a total page turner, no doubt about that, when I got to the end, all I could say was, \\"WHAT?! That's it?\\".  No lessons learned or even alluded to for the main character. No vindications or revelations.  So, it was kind of disappointing in the end.  One really has to draw one's own conclusions and take it for whatever personal \\"lessons\\" the reader gets out of it.
0345529057|4.0|The story itself is great, and I await it's continuation. Now, all that aside, this particular product is pretty good.<br /><br />Mine had some pages that seemed to suffer from machinist problems when making the books and were creased before printing and the print was difficult to read and imperfect at times. Now, this was maybe a total of four pages of the entire four book collection, so no, it was not a frequent occurrence but nevertheless, disappointing.<br /><br />Otherwise, the product is what I expected. Inexpensive softcover books wrapped clean and perfect. Well, mine were almost perfect, but I feel worth the price and I would recommend it and warn of possible minor damage during production.

B009VLXMJA|3.0|First off, I heard this album at the music store and while I liked her earlier records, this one is totally off the wall.  None of it is country but I do admire her ability to adapt to what sells the best.  This album and Carrie Underwoods' 'Blown Away' [which I did buy] is proof that once an artist is popular and makes a ton of money they can make any kind of record they wish and people will buy it.<br /><br />I will wait till Amazon has it for $5 [which I predict it will be soon], and buy it then.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|when using this app does not let you scroll down more than few events then it stops  thats bad! it needs a fix  it is useless the way it is  it is annoying
B009FZHYKU|1.0|Walking Dead rocks!!  Amazon offers so many quality products at great prices.  I have had nothing but positive experiences before and since.  I will not buy TV seasons from Amazon until I know they have improved the experience greatly however.  I never found out how much the entire season was going to cost me.  I had lots of trouble streaming the episode I bought and could not download it.  It would not stream at all at first.  Then when it did stream the overlay to pause and stop would not go away.  I could not see half the screen.  As a result, I cancelled after one episode and went to the other guy.<br /><br />Amazon, you do great things but this was uncharacteristically bad.

B0084U0IEG|3.0|This book is not what I thought it would be; yes, I read Mcewan's ATONEMENT and SATURDAY, and liked both, especially the way both are built around powerful scenes in which characters collide, whereas SWEET TOOTH is told and I do mean told. Rarely do we get any character speaking or acting on his or her own; all are filtered through the narrator, a saucer-shallow young woman, or supposedly its a young woman. Like ATONEMENT, Mcewan pulls one over on his reader, this time in terms of narration.<br /><br />And SWEET TOOTH is a little silly. Was the Cold War going so mushy in the '70s that MI-5 had nothing better to do than fund fiction writers hoping these writers would produce something anti-communist?
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Very enjoyable and the information is comprehensive and accessible to the average person.  The humor is appreciated, too.  I'll read more by this author.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|STAR TREK (2009) is a suprisingly strong, competent, and solid summer re-imagining of the classic original Star Trek series of the 60s. I still hold TOS in high regard as one of the most groundbreaking TV shows of all time. In many ways, it's still the template for me for what true sci-fi TV is all about. I may be in the minority, but I think that all the \\"sequel series\\" lacked something that TOS still possesses. TNG is heavily overrated and looks more dated than TOS. Also, DS9, while much better than TNG, somehow lacks the charm of TOS. Voyager was decent, and Enterprise was...well...don't know! Back to TNG, not only do I think the series itself doesn't stand the test of time, but absolutely NONE of the TNG films are any good! With TOS, you had a great series AND at least 3 or 4 very good films in the bargain! Not to mention TOS had the best characters, which is one reason I really like this 2009 re-boot. It managed to capture, for the most part, the essence of the characters that drove TOS...Kirk, Spock, McCoy et al!<br /><br />Newbie Chris Pine is very good indeed as 25-year old James T. Kirk, an embittered hellion from Iowa who, as a baby, lost his father, George Kirk, in the film's smashing opening sequence, a battle between the Federation Starship USS Kelvin and the gargantuan Romulan vessel the Narada, which has time-travelled from the future as the result of space anomaly created by a \\"red matter\\" explosion which destroyed Romulus and thrust the Narada into the past. The red matter experiment was actually supposed to save Romulus. None other than Ambassador Spock himself (the great Leonard Nimoy in an extended cameo) led the mission that went awry and is blamed by the Narada captain Nero (Eric Bana in a gusto-filled performance). FutureSpock also is sent to the past by the explosion and is banished to a nearby planet as Nero plans to wreak havoc on the galaxy, thus the plot of this summer blockbuster.<br /><br />Kirk is coaxed into joining Starfleet Academyby Captain Christopher Pike (wonderfully essayed by the always-reliable veteran actor Bruce Greenwood) and along the way meets the fellow down-and-out Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy (persona nailed by Karl Urban in my favorite performance of the film!), a country doctor who joined Starfleet as a fresh start after a messy divorce. At the academy, Kirk has a run-in with one of the academy trainers, Commander Spock (terrific work by Zachary Quinto) after Kirk \\"cheated\\" on the infamous Kobayahsi Maru simulation exercise, which was designed by Mr. Spock. As Nero's path of destruction nears Earth, Starfleet activates the fleet to engage the Narada in battle. Among the fleet is the newly christened Starship USS Enterprise, captained by Pike, with Spock as first officer. The grounded Kirk (who has useful knowledge on how to stop Nero) manages to gain passage on the ship with the help of McCoy.<br /><br />Among the recruits assigned to the ship are McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov. While I was generally impressed by the characterizations of  the \\"main 3\\" Kirk/Spock/McCoy, I was less impressed with the supporting mates. I felt that Sulu (played by John Cho) and Chekov (played by Anton Yelchin) were very underused, while Uhura (played by Zoe Saldana, who had a major role in this film) was miscast, capturing none of the essence of the character from the 60s series. Also, even the great Simon Pegg was a bit much to take as Scotty, whose character was picked up by the Enterprise during the mission on a faraway space station. Thankfully, the main characters compensate for the rather weak supporting cast. These supporting roles were too \\"off\\" for my taste. Hopefully, they'll rectify that in the new film to be released in the spring of 2013.<br /><br />Director J.J. Abrams does a fabulous job with the film's pacing. In particular, the musical score is pulse-pounding and the space battles are spectacular, giving the film a palpable feel to the viewer. The movie manages to encapsulate an old-school summer blockbuster atmosphere. While the characters could have been more fleshed out, the movie has a good story, mixed with great effects. While many Trekkies may feel a bit letdown, I thoroughly enjoyed this re-boot, which has re-generated an iconic franchise by paying homage to the REAL Star Trek series...TOS!
B009UZBLSG|4.0|Pros: Full 1080p capable, uses standard charging Micro-USB cable to power it.<br />Cons: I wish it had a micro HDMI out (since I already own a few of them)<br /><br />Works great, but could  be fantastic if it included an HDMI cable (even if only 3 feet/ 1 meter long). Shipping was pretty fast (shipped via Amazon).

B000FA5SMK|4.0|I gave this book a four star rating because as soon as I finshed reading it I was a Nelson Demille fan for life. He has a great way of bring the story to life and John Corey is just the type of man that America needs.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Have watched this film's progress on line for years. When I recieved it, I was not disappointed. It is a good fun film with loads of satire. It is not for the thin skinned politically correct. Definitely recommended.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|I gave this movie a four star rate because a Treky like myself I know that anyone loving Sci-fi will love it.
159448385X|5.0|A fantastic novel involving love, friendship, and heartbreak in a culture so foreign to the West. Hosseini paints pictures with words so that the reader is spellbound by the narrative in this realistic fiction story.
1400067820|5.0|There is something very energetic in this book that makes your mind working. And I find it good to get an additional go when such a book comes to hand.<br /><br />The thing is that it just make you thinking. And in a good way. Not in forcing logic on you which feels tiresome, but in a weird way of arousing your brain to think again.<br /><br />The only other books i found myself re-reading were \\"Surely you are joking mr. Feyneman\\" and harry potter<br /><br />There are other excellent reviews here summarizing the book. So I can comment on the reading experience proper.<br /><br />Note: this is a book to savor. Do not read on a hurry. And like a delicate meal, it need time and slow ingestion.
1451695187|5.0|I read Newsweek's excerpt of the book (10/15/2012) and had to buy the book.  Before reading it I was convinced that there was no God, certainly no Heaven.  Dr. Alexander's experience completely changed my life and beliefs.<br />I have purchased extra books for family and friends in hope that it will have a profound effect on their lives too.
B003OJBWGK|4.0|I like this album a lot.  I bought it for my girlfriend and I think I ended up enjoying it more than she did.
1433502410|5.0|saved a lot of money versus buying it from school book store, will diffenitly look to buy more books fromn this reseller
B000ZP8174|2.0|As the Director of Surgical Services, the hospital approved the purchase of this clog for 7 of the members of my OR team. The bottom tread is coming loose on one shoe and also one side of the strap has come off on another one.  Disappointed.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Another great addition to the superhero genre! Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is always enjoyable, but Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk steals the show.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I use this pretty much everyday when I run,it is so comfortable and weightless, I would definitely recommend it to anyone! Love it!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre with my daughters and we all enjoyed it so I had to add it to our collection. I purchased it just before a trip to see family at Thanskgiving and it really helped with the car ride.
B000002GYG|5.0|I was instantly a devoted fan the first time I heard/saw Tom Waits in 1975 on a Canadian middle of the night music program. He was just a pup in age but a sage well beyond his years with a bourban voice and a style all his own. I am particularly fond of his early work including Rain Dogs and Blue Valentine but ahhhhh... Nighthawks. Absolutely brilliant. Nobody, Better Off Without a Wife and Putnam County shine. I literally wore out two albums and my CD version is ready for a replacement.<br /><br />If you've ever been lonely, had a broken heart or are simply an aficionado of perfect lyrics, buy this music NOW! You will not be disappointed as it is a masterpiece.
B0040I09RM|4.0|After hearing the rave reviews, I decided to give it shot.  Bought the 1st season DVD after watching the pilot.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I am having the same looping problem on my Kindle Fire HD 7 that the other one-star reviews have stated.  There is a very distracting skip at the end of many of the loops.  I can't say if it is for every sound in the app, but every sound I have tried has skipped.  Mixing the sounds does not really help.  You get skips at different rates, but you can still hear them all.  I loved the free version on my original Kindle Fire, and eagerly purchased the full version as soon as I upgraded to the Fire HD.  I have been waiting since then for an update.  The skipping makes the app utterly useless.<br /><br />**************************<br />Update:  The skipping problem has now been fixed, and the app works perfectly.  There is a large selection of nice, relaxing sounds that can be mixed in different ways.  I work in a cubicle, and use this app with headphones to drown out loud conversations.  I'm deducting one star for the long wait for the update.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|I love any werewolf story and this one was very enjoyable, not as scary as I thought it would be but definately looked beautiful. Great costumes, great sets.
0307592731|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this book.  It was ok, the people she met were interesting, but nothing really happened during her trek that was that interesting.  Her walk was almost boring.  I expected her to experience more difficulties, or at least some drama.  Didn't see that.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|I love science fiction movies, and this one was a good, tongue-in-cheek type movie.  The overall story was well told and filmed, but some of the 'acting' was a bit poor - until you take into account the (apparently) deliberate 'campiness' (think Batman, old TV series with Adam West).  I'm just sorry that it never came to a local theater.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Angry Birds orginal was highly addicting!  Loved it, had to try a new version bc we'd beaten all the levels.  This a def a great edition!!
B005QUQP76|5.0|Went from a v.1 Razer Lachesis to this.  After getting used to holding it, it feels excellent!  Nice weight and very smooth.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|works great and without the ads I don't have to turn off wifi (my 2year old presses the link<br />it does not drain the battery and corrects time estimates when usage changes.<br />the persentage in the notice bar does not work for kindle first gen. not sure about others. it would be cool if that did and if I saw it on the screen saver.<br />chimes at percentages would be nice too. like a clock 5 for 50% etc.<br />I love it and would pay for upgrades
B0063IH60K|5.0|The graphics are crisp and bright. Yes there are ads because the game is free, but they only pop up after a game is completed so it's pretty minimal. Great game!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love the mysteries in the game it is so fun everyone should like it I didn't like how it cost money but I got it for free
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I Love it.f2f f2f accessed by the hitch scoffed at the hitch scoffed at least one that is a good idea of
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Enjoyable movie; humerous and a good story line. Kids will see that it's ok to be different and go after what your heart is set upon.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I LOVE Halestorm exspecially this album!!! Also I LOVE two of their songs on here, A Familiar Taste Of Poison and then the song I'm Not An Angel!!! I also love the cover art that they have on there!!!
0743270754|3.0|I don't know what I was hoping for, but the book ended up being a history book written about the people living at the  time of Lincoln and his association with them.  It had interesting tidbits about all of them which was nice to read, but not compelling.  Doris Kearns Goodwin is an amazing historian and her book is written with that skill.  However, there isn't much to keep the interest.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|My father had been looking for this album EVRYWHERE AND COULDN'T FIND IT! But thanks to me I found it and got it for him, even though I wanted it for myself!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have used this app during my work day in place of the adding machine on my desk that has so many functions it can be cumbersome to use.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|I thought that this product was way over priced but Amazon was the cheapest that I found. Even though is was expensive to me, my son absolutely loves it!
0470450266|5.0|For anyone struggling to learn anatomy in zbrush or in general, this is a must-have. I use this book more than any other zbrush ref book for everything from muscle structure to proper proportions.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|Taking a bit of a gamble this time, our good friends at Section9 are working on the case without Motoko. But don't fret, this is still an action packed saga that can only be realised by the people who started us on this journey. Motoko does make an apparence in the end and the movie length saga finishes in typical Ghost in The Shell fashion.<br /><br />If you loved the series and the other films, then this adds to the story nicely.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|i found the 3d video a whole lot better than most others that have came out in the past year.
B001E45XT4|5.0|These babies are super comfortable and the mic is fantastic. My left ear touches the speaker ever so slightly and begins to hurt after an hour or so, but I take it off for a few minutes and it feels better. If you have ears that stick more than normal (I consider my ears normal) then you might want to find another pair that goes deeper.
0525425764|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my neice.  She loves the book and the Theodore Boone series by John Grisham.  The book was shipped in a timely manner and without any incidents.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first two books were great and  built me up for an exciting finish, Alas the third book did not measure up.  A lot of trilogys seem to falter on the last book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a book that will invoke every emotion. I laughed, I cried, I felt angry, but overall it left me with hope. It is a lesson for every age. It makes you think and question and look beyond the surface to what lies inside your own soul. This is a great read for older elementary children, tweens, teens and yes, adults. I couldn't put it down.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book because I loved \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" which I was told was very similar in writing style. I loved the feral need Gideon possesses for Eva it's what every woman who loves romanticism longs for. That look of need and complete adornment from your partner that says \\"I can't be without you\\", \\"You are everything I need and want\\" ...like the air you breath! Although the main ideas are extremely similar to Fifty Shades of Grey, it had it's own interesting twists. I would consider reading more of Sylvia Day's books in the future.
B003F0GM36|5.0|I remember when I first got the CD. I just couldn't be anymore surprised from what masterpiece Townsend created. Listening to winter while everywhere is covered in snow and I'm kinda drowning in my imaginations. Brilliant record. Hopefully got my hands on vinyl version before it was too late. I suggest everyone with a taste in music  try it out. It surly won't disappoint.
1934030554|4.0|The book is contain a lot of details for new users of the power meter, but it gives a organized intro to the the use of the power meter, and the tools nescessary to analyze to produced data.<br />Buying the book is a must, if you have decideed to buy a power meter
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Just an excellent movie and gave a glimpse into the royal family 'inner workings'!  Good story that was well made.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I could watch this movie 100 times and still laugh like its the first time. Very cute and entertaining. Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake play off of each other well. I would definitely recommend this for a good laugh.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|We first saw Alien on VHS, then Laserdisc, DVD and now BluRay disc. The changes in the ability to see more detail is amazing. We have all the Alien movies on individual discs but bought the anthology for the BluRay and for the the &#34;Making of...: and the &#34;..Anthology Archives.&#34;  Found them both to be excellent additions to the collection.  Highly recommended.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious! Cameron Diaz does an excellent job portraying the foul mouth teacher. Not for everyone but those with a twisted sense of humor will get a kick out of it!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|It arrived in excellent condition. The digital copy was nice. Who doesn't love the new star trek, great movie. Love it
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is a really cool game I really think you will enjoy this game as much as I do cause I like this game
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Quality film, great action the plot was well done and thought out.  Robert Downey Jr.  of course steals the show, as does the subtle humor.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This is a great feel-good movie for the holidays.  This appeals to the kid in all of us, and I highly recommend it.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I love Ridley Scott, he is probably one of my favorite directors.  This movie has stunning visuals and effects, but the plot itself was lacking.  I was left with too many why questions?  It is possible that the references were too subtle to catch the first time through, but I was looking and expecting a lot more.
B0015AARJI|3.0|Controller was supposed to be brand new, however the circle button repeatedly gets stuck and affects game play.  If I had bought in it town I could avoid the online return hassle.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|So I had no expectations on whether the film would be as good as the book.  My wife and I watched this together and loved it and were left waiting for the next installments.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really liked reading about a NDE from the viewpoint of someone who could explain it scientifically. It helped me understand it more.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|If you are fans of Maroon 5, this album will not dissapoint.  Most of the songs are well crafted with good lyrics and great hooks.  I've read before that Maroon 5's songs tend to be homogenized or overly crafted to be good &#34;pop&#34; records, thus sucking some of the spontaneity that comes out of writing songs, but I find that their creative process works for me.  You can play the entire album without skipping a track and that to me makes it a worthy buy.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|Space Jam is a classic movie for sure! Lots of fun and who doesn't love looney tunes? I would recommend it to anyone!
B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|Some of the tracks , while &#34;listenable&#34;, are not her best work.  To me, the oddest track on the album is &#34;Pour it Up&#34;.  That song was clearly written for a (male) rapper in mind (if you check the credits, it wasn't written by Rihanna, but by some dude).  Maybe she was trying to make an artistic statement by singing this song, but the lyrics about &#34;throwing dollars at strippers&#34; sounds totally ridiculous coming from her.<br /><br />That being said, she has some really exceptionally good song on this album.  My favorite is Stay (I think it works because it is stripped down to basically a piano and good lyrics).  My next favorite tracks are Jump, Diamonds, and No Love Allowed.<br /><br />The more you listen to this album, the more it grows on you.  I can listen to it straight through without skipping tracks (even with Pour It Up).  You can't say that with most albums these days.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|I ordered this DVD as New as a Christmas gift.  When the DVD arrived , the whole thing appears to have been sitting in someones basement for years unopened.  The outer casing is chipping and splitting in areas and there is dust and dirt under the stickers.  Very disgusting.  The actual packing box was undamaged.  I should have just bought this locally instead of trying to save some extra money.  Shame!
B006PAZMMK|5.0|There is a reason why this guy was nominated for a grammy: Skrillex is a master at sound manipulation and doing it in a way that is musical (if that makes any sense).  If you don't think this guy has talent, listen to the last track on this album: it is a classical rendition of the tracks on this album and his previous one.  Well done.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is definitely an app to get. You can choose from a variety of utensils, and the app has excellent quality. It works perfectly on my kindle. I absolutely, positively recommend you get it. It is, without question worth the two dollars!
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Most of the songs are quite catchy although I would not consider them as a rock act (I've read that somewhere).
B00991TCOG|5.0|I absolutely love this album, listened to it hundreds of times.<br /><br />If you do nothing else, listen to shadows. Amazing.
1451673442|3.0|Gratitude is an essential part of a happy life and Rhonda Byrne gives the reader some very creative ideas for developing this.  As a spiritual practice, a grateful heart will open a person's journey to a richer life.  It shouldn't be done as a prescription for &#34;magic&#34;.  Either a person is looking for a deeper experience in life or an easy fix for excitement.  It reminds me of a priest saying, &#34;Say 3 Hail Marys and everything will be alright.&#34;
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Special effects etc... very good. Story line and characters easy to follow, lot's of action and suspense. You will not be disappointed if you like fantacy movies.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|MY DAUGHTER WANTED THIS AND I GOT IT FOR HER SHE LOVED IT. SHE IS NOT A DIE HARD FAN BUT LIKES SOME OF THEIR SONGS AND MUSIC.
B004SIP8SY|4.0|I, already had Kill Bill Vol. 1, this is the follow up movie. Both movies were very well done, lot's of action and Revenge is a powerful  thing, this movie brings it out. I, would recommend it to anyone who likes hard core women action figures (Uma Thurman) does a great depiction of this. She wipes out about 60 foes in one scene, then goes after two other hard core  women figures.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft, overall is awesome. Its fun. But its super addicting!!! Me and my sister got are kindle fire's taken away. We played minecraft too much and did nothing but minecraft. beware the addiction.
B001EO748M|3.0|Same problem as Season 1 and 2: No closed caption feature working. :( I was very disappointed. Picture quality was excellent. But if you can't hear the words or see the words....its just not as enjoyable.
0547884591|5.0|I haven't finished the book but in true Tim Ferris fashion his book is well written, documented and illustrated. I have recommended it to several friends as gifts for Christmas.
B007C3TVNA|5.0|product was chosen my teenager and I ordered and paid for it as a gift. they were very happy with the product
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I bought this product to play shooters on PS3 and I think it works just fine. Follow the online instructions and you'll be good to go very quickly.<br /><br />It does not work well for all games. E.g. in MassEffect 2 I ran into some trouble with only having 8 directions (WASD) for the left stick when picking stuff in the inventory.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|a light delightful read.  a little long towards the end but in all I enjoyed the read.  glad I purchased it, but wouldn't read it twice.
0060531053|5.0|Great book at a great price. Thanks<br />A a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B0086700CM|5.0|its great both as an app and a game. I live it. it rind great and.is wicked fun to boot.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|outstanding! really fun games. interesting story. creepy bad guy. what comes next? I will be staying tuned !  go make more.....
B008RC72G8|4.0|This was a great movie.  Glad we bought it, Johnny Depp was awesome as usual.  I just recently got it and haven't had a chance to watch it more than just the one time, but we WILL watch it more than once.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Very much enjoyed this series. It was a great, and &#34;novel&#34;, concept and delivered quite well throughout. I am looking forward to more work by Mr. Scalzi.
B0084I9QIW|3.0|Would be much better with HD audio, but I do understand the limitations with the source material. Seems like they just put this out to make another quick buck on MJ.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I read this after seeing the movie as it sparked an interest and I am a dedicated Sci-Fi fan. I have to say that the book was decidedly mediocre with the exception of the Orison of Sonmi. That portion of the book alone made the rest of it worthwhile. It was so well written and such an amazingly good dystopian future that I can forgive the rest. If I had it to do over again, I would skip the rest and read just that portion of the book.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I've waited for this box set to come out. I didn't buy either of the first two movies even though I loved them both. you always run the risk of another &#34;Deluxe&#34; or &#34;Collectors or &#34;Extended&#34; edition coming out later. Lord of the Rings?. But I'll deal with that if and when that happens. If you're a fan of these movies then this is definitely a must buy.
1401322786|5.0|I haven't read this book yet, but I have his other books and love them.  He is an easy author to read and his book are very interesting.  They make you think when you finish.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />Just, wow.<br /><br />This was a book that I wanted to live in for a long time after finishing (maybe that's why it's taken me months to get around to this review).  Erin Morgenstern has crafted an elegant, magical story of deception, power, and, most of all, love.<br /><br />The characters are flawed and vibrant, and I'd love to slip into most of their skins and live a day in this tale, but the one I love most is Bailey.  Sweet, normal, vital Bailey.  He's the character I would most like to be; the boy who gets to live a dream grander than he'd ever hoped.<br /><br />If you haven't stumbled into this enchanting novel yet, I just saw it in paperback at the bookstore this weekend: snag it soon and hang a do not disturb sign on your door until you are done.
B001HVZO9S|5.0|Good movie, I got this for my mom as a Christmas present this year because I had just gotten her and my dad a bluray player, needless to say this is one of her favorite movies and she lost the DVD copy she had. Can't wait to see her reaction.
1442337966|5.0|This is the best gift I ever bought for myself. I received it in perfect time and I recommend it to anyone who really wants to change their way of thinking, living and loving.<br />Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a very fun version of an old school arcade game.  The coins take awhile to regenerate when you run out but it is an overall fun time.
