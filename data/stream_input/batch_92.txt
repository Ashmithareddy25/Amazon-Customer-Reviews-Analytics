B001EWWFH4|5|We love these, I buying a set for my car too.
B008CTVGI6|4|WORK GOOD ON UTV GOOD
B00HE8HCAM|5|This product fits perfect, and is way easier to use then the stock secondary safety lock tire holder. I have only had it on for a few days, but so far no issues at all, I will update if it ever spontaneously releases while I am out driving. I hated the stock release, especially with a little East Coast rust on there it was a pain to lower your spare. Really like this product by Dorman.
B00JREPRJE|5|they look great on my prius
B001KSEJBW|4|Nice filter at a great price, most people do not even know they have one of these
B003ELZQZQ|3|Good quality, but not for the do it &#34;yourselfer&#34;.  There is not more than half a inch extra material, so it needs to go exactly where they cut it.  If you want the seam to line up perfectly with the bend of the seat, too bad, not enough material.. After trying on my own, I'm giving up and taking it to a professional to install, maybe they can do something with it.
B00VA62UVK|5|GOOD PRICE WORKS  FITS IN THE ARTIC
B00LVSPWTO|5|Excellent product
B001UC729O|5|Why rebuild factory F250 alternator when you can get a Bosch 135 amp with lifetime warranty.  Skip Autozone or O'Reilys and get this one.  Fit was perfect.  Belt was easy to remove (see youtube for how to do it)  Great buy
B004PHDWMM|5|No fire yet, hope I don't have to use it.
B001HLIMD8|2|Did not fit over seat belt slider, I will give it to a friend with a different make of seat belt--great price.
B000NTFWW4|4|No hardware supplied with product. Fiittment was good
B000AMBOPI|1|hoping it would help me see down the road however it does not slightly better light off to the side but when you're going 60 miles an hour you need more light up front
B00E1SLZ74|5|fast shipping, installed at PEP boys. The install guy commented how nice these were, he was taken aback by how little I paid. The mechanic took my car after the install to seat the pads and off I went.<br /><br />I have driven 700 miles in 10 days without any problems. Thanks for a great product and I will look here for future parts.
B008G1WEK4|5|Love the product
B00NJRGD70|3|It's OK. Don't use it much because it's too hard for me to fold up. Instructions not clear. I end up throwing it in the back seat and don't bothering reaching for it when I park it. Mostly because I forget it's back there.
B004RQV4F8|5|fit was just right  best you can buy for a fair price
B00OELXAD0|5|Works very well! Unlike one-size-fits-all shades, this shade is made to exactly fit your window. For the extra price that you pay, it is well worth it because it is very easy to put up and very easy to take down. It keeps the car much cooler, which it was designed to do.
B000BRQ0TW|2|Slowed the leak. Didn't fix it. Followed the instructions on the package
B00IO39N62|5|Just what I needed. Fast shipment.  Easy to put on my van!
B00IO9BLL6|3|Good stopping power. But I've developed a chirping sound a month after install. Probably have to put a one better pads on.
B00C43CY5U|5|Really awesome way to customize your ride! Works great through water and mud!
B00100HAZW|5|Excellent cleaner.  Refreshed dashboard and black door vinyl/plastic with sating sheen, not glossy.
B00BXM2Y7G|4|Feels great when wearing it. The only negative part is that it looks rather large on my head.
B00HTOB0NG|5|My last capacitor blew out. I installed this new one and lights are working fine. its been over six months and i haven't had any issues.
B007T9JZWE|5|Quality pouch with useful accessories.
B001FC7DUC|5|What a difference these bands made to our motorhome. We no longer have a problem with tank odor in the motorhome.  The RV industry should be using these on RVs.
B00QUGWT7A|4|The lights work as advertised, the only thing that is dissapointing is the OE covers below the lights have about  1/2&#34; gap along the top edgs and bottom of the light. They are easy to install, good fit and good look, if you use the covers supplied with the lights, they come with holes for fog lights. iJDMTOY should make some solid covers, in fact I would give them a 5 star rating if they would<br />send me a set of solids.
B007AOQTQS|5|These liners are the best! Worth every penny!
B00NRVC51Q|5|Purchased these hid lights H7 for my jetta '13 they fit perfectly. I went with the 10k blue.
B005HVG4GQ|5|GOOD !! Exelent!!
B000EDSSCU|5|Worked great!
B000CJHO6C|4|Only single layer,  not MLS steel. Should work fine if head and header surfaces are smooth
B001TMGC7I|5|Easy install and looks better in my vehicle than the stock cup holder due to the faux chrome trim. I bought a second one so they would match. Love it!
B00IVP0U56|5|Great looking jacket. Very good fit. Love the zip out liner. Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Amazon.
B00171Q3HU|5|as described
B000BUQODG|5|Got two of these for our little camper.  Installation was a breeze.  You just have to drill holes for the mounts, rather than into the roof they're in the aluminum vents.  Kept our vents open for the duration of our 1400 mile road trip.  Rained like crazy in Lake Tahoe.  No water go through the covers.
B008EEYT42|4|This is a great kit but Amazon Tech was off on telling me it was for my year of Subaru.  After tearing down to the timing belt I noticed that the tensioner assembly was different.  My buddy helping me has a '97 Subaru and he said that is the tensioner his takes.  Everything else worked great though.  Would have been a 5 star review except for the wrong tensioner. In the future I will get parts numbers and cross reference.
B0087NAZM0|3|Hard to hear at highway speeds. Music streamed to unit sounded tinny.
B002TEPIO8|1|it is cracked, spark is escaping from it. Not working properly.
B00KTHVVF2|5|Works great
B007ZDFL68|5|very nice product
B00XZ9OMAC|5|Price was great didn't have any problems getting it programed
B004SFKJIQ|5|Great camping toilet.
B00DNJQ2YI|3|Only had it in use for a couple months, and it's already ripped/torn towards the rear wheels. It did seem quite heavy and worked very well in the rain, but I don't think it can take the heat very well.
B00OOJFWU6|3|They don't pop as much as I anticipated. You need to get really close to see it. And one of them, no matter which tire, would not screw very far.
B000EEZ8L8|5|Exact same part as the Volvo Penta fuel pump I was replacing, but for less than half the price.  When I say it's the same, it had the same part number and both pumps were stamped &#34;Carter&#34;.  Easy to swap.<br />Used on a Volvo 5.7GL
B007HRUX1A|5|two sets of these and a couple of blocks if you don't have jacks...
B0038OYDQW|5|I put this on my laptop case. Constant compliments.
B00FJ5LBOA|5|Almost fits in the palm of your hand but powerful enough for the shop, house, and smaller outdoor projects
B009TAYJ2C|5|The fit is awesome I love these mats. Installs in minutes and has no odor or smell fresh out of the box.
B00NPIUFMM|5|Very bright
B004W3P6AK|5|Will pull anything including the plug from the bottom of the ocean.
B011BWFNWU|3|Good for the price, sunglasses are easily knocked out of the clip
B00Z7KIZPA|5|While I carry a small backpack, some folks I know say that I'm carrying a ''man purse.'' First they tell me I look like a dork wearing a fanny pack, so switch to this [[ASIN:B008Y8E25Y very cool looking Solo Sling]] and this is what I get.<br /><br />All that baggage aside, this Purse Pouch, is a great way to stow my sling along with other items that I don't need distracting me when I'm driving. Not all cars have the exactly the right configuration so. In our case our passenger and driver seats are set at drastically different orientations. So we had to compensate with a plastic tie hear and there.<br /><br />Once installed, [[ASIN:B000CP8I9I I'm In Like Flint]].<br /><br />When you think about it, this purse pouch is a brilliant idea. It hooks on the two front seats in your car. The obvious objection to that is, what happens when the person in the passenger seat once to take a nap and fold his or her feet down.<br /><br />With that out of the way, this definitely is a very useful pouch to have. Not only will it hold a purse , You can also hold a small backpack, extra water bottles that don't fit in the cars native cupholders, briefcases, and things we've purchased at the store.<br /><br />Got this at no cost for unbiased review.<br /><br />' PositiveLogic
B00B84IANG|5|Quick shipping, great product as expected. Fit 2011 perfect
B000P6URMA|5|Very good product easy to send and doesn't clog paper as others do. Very little air pits at all when applying.
B00199FCO0|5|It works exactly as it should and is the same brand as the OEM part.  It does look slightly different so I'd presume it's just a newer updated O2 Sensor.
B000CNLDEM|5|Nice
B00WO4N8K4|1|Wouldn't sync up with Bluetooth properly very poor
B0058RN25K|5|Excellent quality, just what I was looking for. For GM OEM Side Post Terminals with aux. bolt. No complaints.
B000S2VZ6S|5|perfect replacement and works perfect
B00F9RNIPI|5|High quality, thick cables. No complaints. Would order again.
B008FOHWZ4|5|Fit perfectly. One of the best purchases I have made on Amazon. Love them, or at least as much as you can. they are floor mats and not jelly filled donuts.
B006FDD74W|3|Has to be modified to work. Case must have interior filed and trimmed.
B00TO5KPNY|4|Was as described but does not fit well in a large cup holder space. :(
B003ZS21VK|5|Awesome
B00SBZRR8O|1|I guess I was a little ahead of myself on the first review. I bought this in april and probably used it four or five times since then. Went to use it today and nothing. Made sure the batteries were fresh and still nothing. I'm really disappointed because I really liked this product. And as I said in my first review I didn't abuse this item as to the only time i removed it from the five gallon gas tank was when I had to refill the tank, and as I said it just set on the shelf so it wasn't like I was moving it around all over the place. The real kicker is they raised the price almost 20 dollars since april. So with a heavy heart all the stars went away except for one. I think it's a shame that Terapump is selling such a poorly made product and then on top of that raise the price. I would like to apologize to anyone that may have read my first review and influenced them into buying this product.
B00WM3JDVA|1|Used once and broke!!
B00GXEET0Y|4|Worked great the only problem I had was the rectifier had the incorrect connector on it, but the seller was very helpful in correcting the mistake! Only reason for the four and not the five
B00G52H7YE|5|A perfect fit. The local auto parts store offers a set mid grade for $53 and a super grade for $69 why not get the exact fit with all the wire separators and for a great price and delivered to your door in one day or less. My OEM lasted 200k these should list at least 100k. They even have the stress relief wrap as the originals did
B008BGOQT6|5|Teaching my kiddo to ride was great, but being able to communicate while on the trail was awesome! We used some cheap motorola radios mounted to the handlebars and it was a dream come true. The audio is clear. The push to talk button is durable and waterproof, and I've now upgraded my wife and my favorite riding buddy with this setup to make our rides easier.
B00BITIS5G|5|Fit perfectly.
B000KC41FS|5|I haul a 14K pound fifth wheel on this lube plate and I can't complain. I bought two in case the first one cracked or became worn. So far, still using the first one!
B00H93BY88|5|Love the scent!
B000GZPH2U|5|Love it, don't know why i waited so long to get one.
B001AWHRW6|5|Excellent
B00KTJ807W|5|Perfect condition and saved me a crap load of money
B00QLJYTD8|5|It's a very nice helmet. I bought it b/c on the Harley Davidson website wrote a costumer HJC manufacture the helmet for them. Almost $50 less expensive. The helmet has a sunshield was is very handy. It also comes with a bag.
B00AZPI0NE|4|I use it as a back up light on my truck and they are very bright. The only problem I had it that one of them got a little water in it but doesn't seem to affect it
B000V5WF6G|5|This is a great filter. Before this purchase, I made the mistake of buying a cheap generic brand replacement air filter. I could instantly tell the difference.<br /><br />With the K&N filter, I hear a positive difference in my exhaust note. I also do feel the slight &#34;bump&#34; in power - it also makes for a smoother ride.<br /><br />I'll always replace my air filter with a K&N. I've been through enough cheap filters to be convinced of the difference.
B0002STR22|5|Great for the boys at work.
B010V3HSR8|5|VERY NICE
B00062YI8C|5|good item
B003CJG6U4|5|added style to the bike and look awesome
B00SEOIQJ6|2|Just 2 stars for looks. But I must say that the light dispersion is awful. There are, what I can only described as shadows, or dark spots in the beams. Also, there's only one adjustment screw per headlight...just one! Why? It can only be adjusted up or down. This is  otherwise good. So 1 star for price, you get what you pay for, and 2 stars for decent looks. That's being more than generous.
B0017KHTS8|5|Great bulb, works like it says, arrived on time
B007H8DIG6|5|great
B010MHV00O|3|Good tool, but didn't fit my cup holder. Still going to keep because otherwise my growler will be rolling all over my car seat. I kinda had to force it in. It's stable but needs to be readjusted after a while.
B00JAXKBQQ|1|These DO NOT fit a 2015 Charger. With the redesigned 2015 model these are to big to fit in the tracks of the front windows. In addition,  When I received them they were scratched all up like they were seconds from the manufacturer.
B006QH560A|5|Had it more than a year now and still going strong. Works great in cold weather (the reason that I bought it).  The OEM battery worked fine to start the car in hot/warm/cool weather, but had trouble in extreme cold temperatures (0 to -10).  This battery starts me right up every time.  I've recommended these batteries to many friends now, I'm so happy with it.
B00Y4UXPWW|5|very beautiful<br />I arrived on time<br /><br />thankyou
B001F0O19U|5|Great filter.
B004UMB7WY|5|Best wheel cleaner I've used.
B00316K61S|4|ok but be careful it gets hot
B00DWKXCPA|5|The best
B009AQS4IU|5|Very nice. Love it
B0001XPC7C|4|works good
B00CZEZNGU|5|Works very well. Great light and good value I used them to replace the incandescent lamp in work truck.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Well worth the price and does the same job at a fraction of the cost of other big name manufacturers.
B00GX4FN6I|1|Was not happy with product. Had to return it and had to pay for return shipment that wasn't reimbursed
B001DKV5H8|5|Used in my boat transmissions for 10 years. It works! Highly recommend.
B00480N0GE|1|Defective.
B00KLWVY3Y|5|Great light, and super bright for its' size
B008I7RAYQ|5|It was exactly what I wanted
B00BW6DKF8|5|Works great! Easy Install.
B0048EQ8CS|1|Not so great... It is soft, however very cheap quality.  It folds over on itself.
B000CFO05E|5|good
B0085V7BZI|5|The part was shipped quickly and it fit a 2005 Tundra as advertised. Couldn't be happier!
B00GSAUHB8|3|Very nice window cover with full coverage connecting the two circular centers.  Easy to open and close.  Once closed, stores in tight spaces.  Unfotunately, one size fits all is a misnomer.  Site doesn't offer vehicle models and this shield is too short for our Odyssey's windshield.  Even securing it under the visors nets a 50/50 success in keeping it from falling down.  Will use it as long as we can stand it but will look for one made specifically for minivan windows next time
B0000AY3SR|4|It's OK
B002R13QRO|5|this also fit my son's Volvo perfectly! A++++
B00RUQO33M|3|Because there isnt much of a gap between the seat and center console, it makes a loud squeaky sound when adjusting seat.  Other than that, it does the job
B00BGAM93O|5|Cute
B000EALHHG|3|For all the hype, I expected better performance.  Works as well as what I was already using (soap and water) but does not appear to be any better.
B00D9E3GTG|1|Upon first touch I knew this was cheap. I tied to use it for a picnic themed party in my backyard but it was not comfortable so people avoided it.  Then it started to fray and I threw it away.  yuck.
B000RI9GAU|3|Works okay but be careful using, it's sharp.  True to form, I sliced my hand during the first use, but no stitches needed.  And because I'm 68 working on my 65 Mustang I have to use my reading glasses and a flashlight to see what I'm doing.
B004H7INBK|3|I just received and I cannot give any review yet
B00L4V9ECY|4|These resistors worked perfectly to avoid computer anomalies.
B00144AH5O|5|What my outboard needed
B00C0U9KNQ|5|Great product
B000VSY4HG|3|great idea, but very very cheaply made.  Not the Master Lock we once knew.
B008G4Y076|5|product arrived early. installed easily and fits my 2012 Toyota Corolla. very bright, brighter than the previous LED i purchased. now it is easier and safer for me to backup at night, especially i am also using a Pyle wireless backup camera system that came with this purchase. i am very satisfied! now i just hope these lights would last for a very long time.
B00RV83UUG|5|Awesome light bar. Fits perfect in the bumper mouth of my 2011 xterra.
B0068FUHL8|5|I got this to help with getting gasoline out of my Honda EU2000i generator. It seems to work well, develops a nice suction with just a couple of pumps of the handle (that's how it works - you don't need to pump continuously, just enough to get suction going). There is a main tube which you simply push into the pour hole on the top of the unit (it seals via an O-ring), and there's a second smaller tube (if needed) that you can attach to the end of the main one via a rubber bung. All in all it looks well made, and has an air of quality about it. First impression is that I wish the tube was a bit more flexible. It's quite stiff. Another thing that immediately hit me is a contradiction in the packaging and instructions. On the box under Usage Examples, it lists &#34;Extracting fuel from fuel tank for winter storage&#34;. Great! Exactly what I wanted. But then on the unit itself, there is a big yellow warning label that says, among other things: &#34;For safety reasons, do not use the product to extract, siphon or store gasoline or other highly inflammable liquids&#34;. So... where does that leave me? I can understand not storing gasoline in the thing, but extract? That's what this thing is supposed to be for!  Update: Now I have actually used it for extracting the old gas from my generators, and it works very well indeed. Very quick and easy to pump the gas out, and then easy to pour it into a funnel in my car's gas tank. Made the whole process really painless. So, I am upping the stars from 4 to 5, because despite that silly legal warning about not using it for gasoline, it works great for pumping gas out of a generator.
B0040CTUPU|5|Fit a 1997 Explorer perfectly.
B000BNZPSI|2|The benzyl was fine but the lock is just not right, I reinstalled it 3 times trying to get it lined up correctly but its still just not right.
B007NKPD0C|3|These are good but they are just slightly too short if you want to mount straight out from the tube.
B000CLRB4K|5|Awesome Brake Pads and best price on Amazon!
B00OFU33PU|5|WONDERFUL FOR IN OUR NEW CAR...
B000K01WIY|5|Bolted up just fine (way easier than getting the old one off)
B00T8OB32I|5|These turn switchback give the car a better look. I really like them. I would buy again.
B00KJ9AKXE|1|Didn't last for a month and then they stopped, and yes, I paid to have them professionally installed
B004ZF39T0|5|I bought this 6000k set to replace my low beams, and might I say, it is a night and day difference!! I can see more clearly at night, and is a nice upgrade over stock bulbs. I highly reccomend this set if you want HID's in your vehicle, and not spend a fortune for them.
B00WXYHDR4|3|Have used before but think I got a bad batch
B00GWGWTX2|4|Wasn't what I expected it to be but still got the job done
B0006MRQQS|5|Very helpful when you want to see how &#34;clean&#34; things are when dumping the black and gray tank.
B00CHD50TO|5|exact match
B00A5UEOLG|5|Simple and easy, works great with Toyota Tacoma 2015
B004711KFC|5|Just as advertised
B001BNASPM|5|Good quality. Made of durables material. Go cowboys!!!
B00E7G1NGI|4|very cute
B00CST9BC4|1|Not impressed. I used to work for Dorman and expected better. Just over a year and I need to replace it again. Not real happy.
B000Q0P61W|4|no mounts for rear say bar....
B000BQR100|2|Not the best since is to thin and hard to use. After two time use start to fall apart at the edge and the wire frame got bended so could no longer fold as should be
B00DU66UWI|5|look great
B008K6I1RU|3|Ok toilet
B00E8TQAGM|1|it is a piece of junk,does not work at all. I will be sending it back to amazon
B00CDW2MCM|4|It works as intended. Super quiet and filled my tires from 30 PSI to 37 PSI in about a minute. One big flaw about this product is to not trust its PSI gauge, it's off by 3 PSI. Buy another tire gauge, cough TEKTON 5941 Digital Tire Gauge, to get the final PSI after you fill up your tires. What I did was to measure my tire's PSI initially, and subtract my final PSI that I want from the initial PSI. Then, I start the air compressor and count the amount of blocks until I get the difference.<br /><br />Oh, make SURE YOU BUY THE 12 volts cigarette lighter to the battery clamp adapter. Don't risk blowing a fuse on your car.
B006EGAIJ2|5|These are very nice for the price, I use them to drive front deck mower up on them to change blades.
B000X229O0|4|Does a good job.
B00G4S62CW|2|Although the concept is good and customer service was good the paint didn't match my car... Twice.  They were very professional and apologetic but a paint code is a paint code and it was too dark.  Ended up buying OEM Nissan paint which matched perfectly.
B00JY03Y8M|5|Bought for a 2015 4Runner Trail...went on easier than expected.  I'm so used to working on old jeeps that take two days to do a job that should take an hour.  These went on in about 30 to 45 minutes.  I figured out if I lay under the edge of the 4Runner, place one side up to the holes while holding the rest of the nerf bar in the air with my knees, all you have to do is hand place and tighten the screws as you work your way down the brackets.  Then line up and tighten...easy.  And all the recommendations about reversing the directions is accurate....the curved part of the bar goes towards the front of the vehicle, while the straight end goes towards the back.
B0049Z6VTG|5|Fit a 2004 grand prix gtp (supercharged) perfect don't think it fits a standard v6. Was a pain in the a$$ to remove but easy to install
B00YFLNSEK|5|Perfect for smaller jobs around the house. I don't know how this would hold-up in heavy use, but for my needs they are perfect.
B002Q7SGHO|5|I put these on our 21012 Dodge Grand Caravan and I am happy with how well they work.  I have a small utility trailer that I will use to pick up mulch and other things.  With the trailer attached and two yards of mulch added to the trailer, the rear of the van did not sag at all.  Recently we loaded the van up for vacation and again no sag.  On top of that, the ride is not harsh even when the van is not loaded up.
B004VROJ32|5|Simple design, works surprisingly well to give your throttle hand a rest qhen it gora numb...and it will
B006J360CY|5|Good quality. Heavy t-shirt.
B003V9T6YI|5|Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!
B001BNAPHI|5|Good quality
B00KTIQAZW|5|My original key fob stopped working well and eventually all together. I pulled the board out of mine and put it inside this shell and it looks and works like new. I didn't want to have to take it to the dealer to get reprogrammed. The board for this replacement is slightly larger than the original, it would not fit in the original case. My slightly smaller board fits inside this item though, thanks seller!
B011PJBLKC|5|It's Great ! I'm so glad I found this works very good!!!!
B000C1EJDG|4|Solved the problem of leaving overdrive stuck until it stalled, but it sometimes jumps between third gear and overdrive a few times, maybe a problem somewhere else?, other than that it works fine, had it for almost a year installed if I'm not mistaken. PITA to install.
B00AQ29FNK|4|Every time I bring my car in for service and they have to take the wheels off, by the time I get home I often am missing a hubcab.  These are very cheap.  They look good from afar. I learned to put them on and take them off.  I bought 2 sets of 4. When one cracks or breaks I just put a new one on.  Since it is plastic it cleans really well.  I did number mine, so when I take them off I can put them back on the same wheel.
B00ND9L7WK|5|Work as described.
B00SQYQMTK|1|Would not work for me in any of my cars!
B00MEHCM2Q|5|Was delivered just in time and fit perfectly. The online sizing was right on
B00KZ08ZG6|4|Awesome alternative to the two piece remote & key. Less bulk on my keychain. I programmed it all myself. Can be tricky but I finally got it. 4 stars because the rear hatch glass (trunk button) doesn't work.
B003UXZ6RG|5|Haven't used yet but received same time as #35710 and is same size.
B004OK77L2|5|Works great
B000C7VYVU|5|As advertised.
B0076ATS96|5|Perfect fit
B00D93MOM2|5|Nice .. but plastic on top seems to be cheap ... 2 caps came with half plastic missing
B00G4SCA2S|3|Overall for the money they will get your car low. But you get what you pay for. Noisy coils
B0087YN8KA|5|The price and quality exceed my expectations and as a result I have a beautiful fitting piece. My first experience with amazon and it was a great ones
B00UL86LL8|4|Very nice item.... recommended.....
B007R0X4K4|1|This does NOT FIT a 1989 Starion/Conquest 2.6 I4. TOO BIG
B006X152SU|5|The product is exactly what I expected and what you'd expect for the price.<br />Fits well on my Yamaha dragstar XVS650.<br />Excellent service from supplier.  Delivered on time and when one rain cover was missing, contacted supplier's customer service who sent me one within 1 week.
B004VTBB3G|5|Easy to install and were a quick replacement and look great
B00WTCQCIQ|2|I found that it did not come with the proper screws for my truck.
B0060A9C26|5|Fast shipping, easy to install. Matches original mirror
B00NGSDRMG|3|get the exactly size for your machine because the extra 3&#34; will Bern your painted
B00I9TMHV4|5|They fit my truck perfectly and lit up nicely as well. It was the red lights I was looking for!
B006CRT72W|5|Bought this for my brother and he set it up in minutes and works great!
B004ROMJIQ|3|Wrench are a litte biger for the nut
B00YMXIYK4|5|Works great
B006GLEBIO|1|The red always stays on no matter what, i habe to crawl under my car to thrn it off. The wires were too short for my Mercedes, it didnt even cover the full sides. The strips were way shorter than the description. The remote only works in close range. You get what you pay for.....
B00B29SZU0|5|Excellent fit! The front mats are perfect. They cover everything.  I like that the rear mats cover all the way under the back folding seat although I would have liked to see them cut further under the front seats.
B002MQCYWM|4|Inexpensive.  Adjustable three snap a visor will fit any helmet. Does what it's supposed to do. I'm happy with this visor
B002W1OXW6|4|Works very good. Now need something for car that good.
B00OC90BR2|5|Nice quality, looks great.
B004VNWULO|5|I used it to refinish a old helmet. Worked great
B00EDWF1BE|5|So much better than OEM latches, no more hood flutter on my 2012 JKU.  They look so much better and aren't going to fade to that awful grey.  Install was straight forward, instructions were easy to follow.
B00KHA0SFA|5|I got what I needed , Over night it here at my front door. Thanks
B0015KU84C|5|Very good
B001THVNCM|5|I'm a Chemical Guys convert. I use to use whatever I could find at the auto parts store but since discovering these guys I won't buy anything else.
B004URDWVS|5|Have used this product since 1992. It works!<br />Highly recommend.
B00U5HVZJ8|3|Worked ok .. Carbon fiber looked good but not cut to perfect sizing and still left some the old trim showing. None the pieces where marked and no directions so just match the pieces with your interior of your car .... Overall ok .. Still is a nice accent to my interior look..
B000VB66T2|1|I would never buy another China made product
B00IOT4RSA|5|This is awesome and I got a rebate. Works great for my smart car.
B002CCNSTE|5|Great cable for what I needed. Perfect length.
B0079VLQHE|3|Size-wise these don't actually fit into a battery, the bolt is too short.  The thickness of the battery terminal + the thickness of the positive or negative wire-end leave you with 1mm of bolt to try to screw into the captured nut.  Definitely get a longer bolt than these, but this is the correct size.
B002IZFOO2|5|Same as on our pontoon boat lasted 15 years!  Only complaint is the ridiculous price, although amazon was cheapest by far!
B000C59XKG|5|Fit perfectly!
B000WKHXS0|5|as described
B00T9LR2E8|1|Worthless
B004UQ00MI|3|This is a great product for inside of car, but I find on outside black plastic it will not hold up after it rains.. I have not yet tried on the tires yet..
B004E5GBJG|5|This rear window cuts down on the dust while riding in our utv, I'm very pleased!
B00GSAUHB8|4|Does it's job as advertised. The car is still pretty warm, but it's noticeably cooler than without the protector. The big difference for me is my steering wheel isn't searing hot anymore. A minor annoyance for me was that it didn't fit back into the sleeve it came in very easily.
B006TMKXL4|5|perfect replacement and quick free shipping; I like that a quick double-check is done prior to finalizing the order for auto parts.
B005C59LEY|5|Perfect fit.  Minutes to install
B004B68XGC|5|My husband,  the gear head in the family, thought I was crazy to buy this. As it turns out, he thinks this is WELL worth the money!  I bought the compressor to put in our motorhome. We are getting ready to go on a long trip, and I bought it just in case. Well hubbie decided to use it last night to get the correct air pressure in all of the tires. Worked great, fast and quiet! We have blown up two small compressor s trying to air up trailer tires to 90 psi. We will not have to worry about that any more. Buy this, it is well worth the money!
B00UGJWPXU|5|these things are awsome. perfect fit, fast shipping, looks real nice on my car
B00TFZLQ22|5|Just installed the lights in my 2012 Crosstour.  Brightness and color temperature are a huge improvement over the factory incandescents.  Makes it look more modern and upscale.  The kit even included some extra bulbs!  The attached photo shows the difference between incandescent (left side) and LED (right side).
B00W9JC7OW|5|Better than factory and an exact fit for my F350.
B001ABPKUS|5|Fits perfectly on husband's 2007 Avalanche
B001EOWRUW|5|Good Fit
B00QRANHI4|4|Ok, so i have had this for a while now. This unit is alot smaller than i expected, but does seem to be working.<br />I got this to be used in my hydro tent to help eliminated fertilizers/chemical smell, but has a blue light.<br />Does work, put together pretty well and i will continue to use this.
B00MOYJ0YW|3|Works great fit perfect for 02 eclipse visor lights, I only give it 3 stars because shipping was late even with 2 day paid shipping
B00F7S807U|1|Rusted in 2 months. Don't waste your money.
B00513G82U|1|NO THIS ITEM WAS A MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT HAD NO MOUNTING INSTRUCTIONS OR PARTS LIST AND WHAT INFO WAS SENT WAS A BAD PHOTO COPY OF NOT SURE WHAT WAS IT TO BE  STILL HAVNT BEEN ABLE TO MOUNT THE ITEM  WHAT A JOKE I GAVE IT A 1 STAR BUT ACTUALLY IT IS A 1/2 STAR AT THE MOST STILL CANT EVEN FIGURE OUT HOW THE PADDED BACK REST IS TO BE MOUNTED EITHER  NO HOLES TO MOUNT THE BAD LUGGAGE RACK TO TOP OF THE BOX AND THE WELDS HAVE BIG HOLES IN THEM EXPOSING THE INSIDES OF THE TUBBING AND CHROME IS BAD ALSO
B00F3DP2KC|1|Ordered this to make a radiator swap easier, total waste of money. Would not generate enough force to open the hose clamps no matter how hard I squeezed the handles. Having used a Snap-On version, I know how it is supposed to work, this one just would not do the job.
B004XW1NZC|5|Arrived on schedule and worked perfectly.
B008Z264SW|5|perfect
B00H874CMA|5|Fits as described. Need a torque wrench to set bolts at proper ft/lb. Great addition to the car for the price. Going to try polishing the aluminum, and I will revise this review as to whether it was successful or not.
B00DCXEY7C|5|Extremely light, easy to install (some are actually difficult).  Hasnt lost its charge yet!
B002935IV2|5|Simply put, this absolutely did its job of holding the Rightline Gear 100S50 I purchased for the top of my car.  It worked so well in fact that it was actually hard to even move the bag from on top once we were trying to remove the bag.  I loved this non-skid pad and would absolutely recommend it to others.
B00F68GXCU|5|the real stuff.  installed in about 2 hours. no more high pitch marble sounds.<br /><br />I would remove the pulley while the pump is on the motor as it is a lot easier to access the bottom 12mm bolt. Drain all of the fluid in the system by jacking the front end up and turning the wheel back and forth several times so that old fluid will come out the low pressure line.  You will need about 3 bottles to refill the system.<br /><br />Before starting the car, fill the reservoir and turn the wheels several time to prime the system.  crank the car but don't start, refill and then start but be ready to add fluid.  You will get that high pitch noise until the system is full.<br /><br /> I was able to keep the original 2005 Odyssey Touring P/S pump alive till 177k by running a 3/8 inch Magnefine filter on the low pressure return line<br />.
B00KLGVKT8|5|Great quick attach and waterproof!
B004RT0BPO|3|Have had this gas pack since Nov. 2014. Got off work one day and it was leaking fuel everywhere. Can had swelled up from heat I guess. And has leaked ever since. Also the cap is now so hard to screw on and off you need a pair of channel locks to get it on and off.
B003V1SKYS|5|Looks lovely
B001K2MULY|5|Nice wheel
B006MX81M8|1|they are nice and good looking but the seams stated coming apart from back of seat going to try them one more time to see if they want come lose from seam again
B00EC1QUX4|3|The seat frame didn't fit my Ruckus very well. I really had to do some work to the frame to fit. The frame was sticking out of the cardboard box when it arrived at my house. Thus the frame has a few scuffs on it. For the price I guess it's not a bad option for those looking to modify their seat setup.
B00BVQ5XFO|1|Does NOT fit a 2001 f150 quad cab. Ordered 2 of these and they are nothing like what I pulled out of my doors. One size does not fit all.
B00BYV3W5Y|4|Works great, this is a must have with newer wheels with large opening where you can see brake calipers and inside of wheels. This brush has cut my wheel wash time by 75%! Priced it on the Audi site and is a bit overpriced here but no shipping made it a wash.
B00I0Z14AW|5|I'm 100% satisfied true OEM kit for this win.
B0009IBJBM|5|I use it for my riding lawn mower battery. It works great...
B00BITQON4|5|The handle fit like a T! Took me about 5-7min to install it. The handle didn't come with any screws for attaching it to the car. But the one I replaced this with, had all the screws I needed. Looks just like the original!
B00TO9H68W|2|I purchased this cooler to go on an extended week long trip.  I froze all of our food and packed with block ice and dry ice.  Overall, it did well.  However, when we put cans in the cooler with just ice (not packed to the top), the ice doesn't last more than a day.  That is the disappointing part.  We thought this would replace our other coolers, but our old Coleman does a better job keep ice than this cooler.  And yes, we make sure it is not left open, and latched close.
B006FUT0AK|5|A great quick wax. Great for a quick durable wax job that I find to be great for my central A/C unit as well as automotive vehicles'
B0095GK9SI|4|These end caps make more sense than buying a whole new shorted bumper. Easy to install and I get nothing but compliments. A little too pricey for what you actually get, otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
B001O0XE1M|5|Came quick and works well
B00DSD6HZI|4|Very cute. Will probably purchase again if they are still available when they fall off.
B000JL760W|1|It is true that if you change over to Evans coolant and do it right, it will keep from corroding your engine parts and hoses. It has been shown to cause build up in Aluminum radiators though, and because there is no water, it only transfer heat HALF as good as normal coolant. A detailed studied showed that the highest octane fuel had to be used to keep the engine from pinging, timing had to be retorted in a few cases, and ALL of the heads on the engines used ran 110-148 degrees hotter. This is not good for the valve seals. True the coolant did not boil over or create extra pressure, but I will not run an engine with the head another 100+ degrees hotter. I will stay with the other coolants and I will have to change the coolant every three to five years, but I will not have to worry about melting the heads on my engine. Here is the site for the detailed review:<br />http://www.norosion.com/evanstest.htm
B00KL3ALGO|5|I love that these shades are static cling and don't have bulky suction cups! They fit nicely on the car windows and block the sun very well.
B009XIY22C|2|No real place to mount it on my bike - needs round tube  - my Vulcan has none past the handlebars
B008JJWEXA|5|Live this product. It works just like I expected
B00K35QDFI|1|Did not fit my car
B009A72OP8|5|Great for riding the motorcycle. Blocks the wind and has a perfect tint.
B0016ITCVS|4|Bought it for my Sone, He said it was just what he needed, and fit fine.
B003HU0YFQ|4|Still working great after almost a year!
B00K56K1W6|1|Worse product ever.  I am in southern California and in the heat these moldings simply fall off the doors. They are filled with a glue that gets gooey when hot and it drips all over your doors and  gets on your hands and clothes every day.  I ended up taking them off because they are useless and they leave behind a very stubborn glue that I still have not been able to remove, so it's still all sticky like honey.  BAD MANUFACTURER!!!!!
B000JZ9T4O|4|Fit and worked fine.
B001946B04|5|I chose this for the Eco-friendliness. Seems to wash my car just fine and nice and lots of suds for a little amount of soap.
B005VA1C56|5|Loud Exhaust just what I was looking for.
B0013ERRSK|5|I purchased this for my RV and camping since my Aussies like to paddle in their water bowl.  They both loved it!  It is a nice size.  I wish they had a larger one for outside.  I am now using it on my patio and will get another one for the RV.
B000637TE6|2|Soap and water worked just as well
B009T8M1DS|5|perfect fit, love it...
B002Z36V6M|4|Since receiving it, I've already found it extremely useful. Pocket-size. Very bright. Convenient magnetic end. Cheap batteries, gotta keep an eye on them should they leak. Will definitely change them to rechargeable at their life's end.
B0002SR4Q8|3|Great tool very handy must have in your toolbox, won't fit smaller oil filters
B00ED37HU6|5|took me forever to find this, but it fixed my backup light on my 02 dodge dakota
B00ES2FT02|5|It's sticker. What else do you want?
B001Y9395E|5|first time i ordered these some tabs were broken, second time Im very satisfied with the way in which I received them. Packaging was excellent!!
B00L3NYVHQ|5|I bought it for my new car a few days ago. It came with a pair of microfiber cloth. The quality is amazing and wipes out dirt very easily and the best part is it is easier to wash them. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00F5LNAUG|5|The cover fits good, fits tight and was easy to get it on
B003CJJ8L8|5|This stuff is amazing! Soaked my helmet in water with hydrogen peroxide in it, then applied the Helmet Fresh and let it dry. The stink is gone and it hasn't come back. Bought second bottle for second helmet with same problem. So far the same results.
B000MJSIDK|2|Purchased these directly from Hawk, they were clearing these out a couple of years ago, and now I know why...<br />Installed them with new front rotors on a Saturn SL2<br />Lasted not quite 20K miles, their dust level was average, but not low.<br /><br />Stopping power is adequate, however, not happy with how few miles they lasted.<br />The box claims &#34;extended life, low dust, & max stopping power&#34;<br />During the short time that I had them didn't get any of these in an adult driven vehicle used for commuting.<br />I've experienced  better results with far less expensive brake pads than these &#34;performance&#34; pads<br /><br />Their &#34;Lifetime Warranty&#34; does not apply to &#34;normal wear&#34;<br />Not much of a warranty.<br />Would not purchase Hawk brake pads again
B00K1IY0HK|5|It works as expected and looks great. I installed it on a '16 wrx by prying open the driver/passenger plastic bezel. Finding the connector was tough and the hardest part for my install. It was wedged all the way in the back on the passenger side taped to other wires. Untaped it and connect to new mirror. There are specific instructions online on how to specifically replace this mirror but they didn't really mention this explicitly.
B003ERTZPW|5|I have big hands and always tear gloves but not these
B00FLHVYE8|5|Awesome covers for the camaro ss calipers. I recommend for all camaro owners
B00I96JZU8|4|Arrived on time and worked as expected
B0015KWAFM|5|Very good product
B002R89PQS|1|Did not fit the listed application.  The bracket was the wrong size and clocked differently than the old one.  Thankfully, the actual pulleys were the same so I removed the new pulley and installed on old bracket.
B00F9RNIPI|5|They look like good quality jumper cables.  the bag and the brush for contacts are a nice addition.  I hope that I never need to use them. :)
B00EBLGYCC|5|Looks high quality, let's see how it holds up to weather.
B0042KJV9U|4|works as advertised and is extremely helpful in performing diagnosis.
B000FGI5BU|4|Fast shipping accurate product
B008HZP1K4|1|Well, fast delivery, good product, etc. But, did NOT actually fit my 2005 Audi S4! After my local garage had the car up on the lift and apart, they discovered that these were not the correct pads and had to &#34;special order&#34; the correct pads from a local Audi dealer for about six time the price of these pads. Since I had ordered the pads somewhat in advance of scheduling the service, I have been unable to return them due to having them over 30 days. I ordered the same brand pads for my BMW X5, and had them installed at the same place with no problems (almost no problems, had to order the sensors from Rock Auto).....
B003YOBN3W|5|Was the perfect replacement for the failed component.
B00307WN2S|4|NEED SEAT COVER FOR A ACTIC 650 P  BUT COULD NOT FIND THEM AT A FAIR PRICE AND THERE WORK
B004HE1YK0|5|Perfect OEM fit includes anti-vibration shims
B00BVPOC20|5|Arrived as expected. Fit perfect.
B00YMKO2RG|5|Thank you a fits perfect to my Chevy cruze
B00XTFOLG2|4|They fit an look great , but I had to buy one bolt a little bigger for the left side , It would have been helpful if it had instructions
B000GTW274|5|Excellent
B009NOZ5AY|5|An upgrade to regular bulbs
B004HP19W2|5|Great air filter and highly recommend K&N as the best air filter for standard and after market. Thank you,
B005TIRF4M|5|These things fit great and look killer on my 03 yamaha fz1, highly recommended
B00KGGTF9U|5|I love having a shade for my car and this definitely does the trick of keeping the sun out and my seats cooler!
B008Y604XA|2|The description doesn't tell you exactly what to expect. This is a small, die-cast model that's probably 8 in long. Cheaper plastic but cool looking.
B000N5OOQ8|5|If you own a Harley with a lot of chrome, this kit is the BOMB!  Highly recommend.  The chrome paste not only cleans the oxidation , the Detail and Wax aerosol works wonders on the basecoat/clearcoat.  The towel, wicks away water withe ease.  The only thing I have not used yet is the Corrosion protector.
B000C5YD42|2|This sensor had no plastic cap. There were scratches over the actual sensor. I even wonder the one I received was new or used. May the sensor got the scratches on transit because it had no plastic protection cover.
B001KOG1R6|4|Quality product fixed my issues
B00L2OXNUW|5|excellent for my 07 impreza
B00904WS7A|5|Love the jacket!!
B007JB1G2Y|5|Easy installation.  The color is great and really pops on my back windshield!!
B00BI0J2VE|5|Just as good as the other mass pairs I've had over the past 20 or so years
B00HRZVC6W|4|Great deal, and a must have for any vehicle.
B007KBKT6C|5|Fits the 2015 KTM RC390 no problem. Shims seem to be as high or higher quality than OEM.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works well.  I bought this and an SAE to battery-terminal connector for the specific purpose of powering my smartphone.  Puts out 2a and no issues when keeping a big/bright smartphone charged.
B00NBN1C78|4|Easy to install without needing to drill any holes and will fit most trailers.  Includes a hole for a lock if you are worried about the items being stolen or the slider bar popping out.  Folding cross bar is designed to fit most trailer lug nuts.  This is really a handy little box and makes it so you don't have to store one more item inside the boat or truck.  The box looks good installed as well.  Like other reviewers, I am worried about rust especially when submerging.  I'll probably take some extra precautions to protect it further.
B0079RP0IY|5|Works as expected, have used this brand for years
B00KY0AQOQ|5|Fit right and on time.
B00429NKWK|5|Great product.  Highly recommend it. However, ber ready for some tired arms.  Mine lasted 3+ years on a 1999 Lexus.
B000F5DQWY|1|Write review the last day that I could to return this air horn was on the 6th of August and is now the 15th and it stopped operating as far as I'm concerned this is a piece of junk
B00H6ETIWY|5|Fit on my Rangers.  Love them.
B001KQD7YE|5|Easy to install and fitted perfectly
B00DSR466G|5|match my seat covers perfectly.
B003V3PZIK|5|great kit, although it needs to include wax removing and speed shine microfiber cloths also.
B003RQBKLC|5|Works good.
B0057FK080|5|Fit tight, works great. 2010 Camero RS.
B00JMLBIF4|5|Great deal on exactly what I needed.
B00IWDOD9Q|5|Beautiful and always love the company's designs. Will order again as I have before.
B00VXY2974|1|Returned this item
B004NJUWP2|4|I like it, works well.
B00F86WN60|5|Did the job and worked great.
B001EOV492|4|c
B003ZVA6PA|5|Very absorbent. Photo not really true to color (for green. Pink was fine), but we use them to clean up messes in the kitchen so it isn't a big deal.  They're more like a kelly green.
B00KFT1NDO|5|Fit perfect 2007 Honda Civic EX.  Trunk light.
B00F4MQJ5O|1|Absolute junk!!
B0065WM09G|5|Fit right into my 2012 can-am spyder rt. Not sure if it will increase my gas milage like they say however nice to have a cleanable filter.
B0018QJ7IQ|5|So far I love my Rugged Ridge Jeep cover. I had to move my Jeep out of the garage due to my cats getting on top of the jeep and scratching it..The cover is water and UV proof. I love it!
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Delivered as advertised, I feel confident having it if I NEED it.
B005BNP7YU|3|the light works ok but it doesn't have a long enough hitch for it to hook up, it's about a half inch too short
B00W81YC76|5|Easy instsll
B00VSB80E8|5|I have had many different sun screens but these are the best so far.  They come as a two pack and come with 8 suction cups.  4 suction cups per shade.  I love the American Flag look to them since my fiance and I are both very patriotic.  They go one the window very easily and stay on very well.  I have driven with my window open and the wind will blow others off the window.  These stay secure in the spot they were put on.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
B001PLM5TC|5|Awesome product. Arrive day after ordering too
B000RSTXG2|5|Replaced my broken Pitot tube.  Great quality, no false &#34;kick ups&#34;
B000C53XRK|5|Works great!
B000FPYEUC|2|Despite all the positive reviews I don't think this product is worth the money.  Trying to dial it in exactly is a lot trickier than you'd expect.  One minor tap of the unit will cause it to vary by 3-4 PSI.  And there's no way to know until it stops, you remove it, and test the PSI.  It's nice that it's set and forget, but the set part is too finicky.  You're much better off with a pass-through unit that lets you measure the PSI while it's deflating like the Teraflex 4807200 Air Deflator.  It doesn't stop once it gets to a certain PSI, but you can test it while it's deflating.  So, you put one on one tire, let it go for 30 seconds, go to the next tire, etc.  Then you go back to the first tire and measure it using a cheap tire gauge.  I guarantee you'll be done faster because these let more air out faster.  It's a tiny bit more work because you have to use the gauge to know where you're at, but that means you won't have to wonder what PSI it's at.  And it 1/4th the price.
B004RNOVTM|1|I've owned this for a smidge over 2 years, sprung a leak today and it has always kinked!  I have owned several that cost less, used outdoors and still going.  I think there are better values than this cheap product.
B00TQ07IOQ|1|Too thin.  Didnt like them.
B00843V9G4|5|Ordered for my teenaged nieces when they want to ride with me.  Good value, but the medium fits a little larger than what I expected.  I normally wear a Large in the Harley branded helmets, and I can wear this, though a little tight.  I'll order a small as well, and will have everyone covered in a proper fitting helmet.
B00CU79KTS|3|these are nice clear non idstorted vision through the glasses<br />Readers work well, only thing is that the polarized lens makes my car radio led screen black<br />same with the LCD on my odometer<br />other than that they are great
B00H5F3J9C|5|Random mechanic kept my original polished valve caps. Found these replacements for cheap price, fits perfectly 5 stars.
B00JSJMUBQ|4|Feels good, looks good, only the smell keeps me from rating this 5 stars. (I heard it goes away in about a week...)
B0131EZTVQ|5|[[VIDEOID:bf2375c4c03115f7fe1f00ee67dc50ad]] I love this little thing! It's perfect!<br /><br />I have to admit that I eat and drink in my car a lot.. and sometimes those little straw wraps end up all over my car, in my pockets, and in my floorboard. Well, now I have a solution for that and so much more. Cigarette wrappers? Throw them in this mini trash can! Paper french fry sleeves? Throw it in the mini trash can! It's small, cute, and fits right inside your cup holder! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B000RNU47O|5|This project was more than I bargained for!  I was unprepared for the labor to install this on my 8 year old Nitro.... rust abounds!  However, an impact wrench and plenty of patience prevailed!<br /><br />The hitch itself is great!  Bought this to hold a hitch rack & waterproof bag for vacation traveling.  Worked fantastic on the way to Florida & back.
B000C5UFI0|5|Worked perfect. Saved a lot of money buying this way rather than from the dealer.
B0002HRBSU|5|very good product.
B00MZMTQOM|1|Cheapest pos I've ever seen. Do not buy this. Screw for the adjusters pulls out of the connectors so you can't adjust them. Cheaply made. Junk
B000C54496|5|These improved the ride of my truck by leaps and bounds. Moog has high build quality and these Ball Joints are no different. I have a pair on the truck now that have well over 60k miles on them and still operate fine. These were to replace cheap aftermarkets that were put on before I bought my truck. Getting them off and putting the new ones on is obviously not an easy task but there is nothing that Moog can do to change that. These were for a 2008 F250 application.
B007GQ4NKY|5|Looks great, easy to install.  Excellent price.  Was missing a set of attachment screw - not a big deal given the price.
B00MS1FKOA|5|looks great
B000C9PARW|1|WIRE COMES APART EASY DO NOT BUY
B003ULZ73G|5|Easy install, fit well and look good
B009GO6CYO|5|Awesome and you cant beat this price.
B003AT9PMM|5|Perfect fit, got here a week early, good welds good finish, looks hell for stout.
B000F6F99G|5|Installs easily.  Easy to adjust lasers for 2 cars.
B0002SRJCM|2|I bought this suction gun for oil changes for small motors such as a lawn mower and pressure washer.<br />While this gun appears to be well made, it is too big for what I need.<br />Not the fault of Lincoln Lubrication, but the tubing is too large to fit into the oil reservoir on the lawn mower,<br />I should have read the description more carefully before I placed my order.
B005JJ8TYQ|5|This thing works great and is tough. Anyone would be better off removing the hitch than even thinking of tackling this thingI turn keyside toward rear of hitch when locking up
B00EB3H4RY|5|This is a great quality sunshield that fits my windshield very well. Very happy with the purchase.
B000VDYY1M|5|Very durable and was able to wash them
B000C9JXZ2|5|Worked for my 2001 Silverado 5.8L V8. I had intermittent stalls and rough idle for over a year (no codes on PCM). It got bad enough to stall after it got warmed up, every time. Would not start again until it cooled off and it ran perfect till warm again. I was ready to junk it. Finally got the code P0336 and  this was the problem. It does not always set a code at first. Look on the forums and this is a very common issue for these engines. Now I know what to look for next ttme.<br /><br />OEM part for half the price of dealer part. Took about 1 hour to install. Drop the starter (leave the wires connected) and move it under exhaust manifold. The sensor is behind the starter. Remove the connector and one bolt holds it. Safety reminder: Don't forget to unhook the battery and use jack stands when you jack it up. 2 starter bolts are 13mm and sensor bolt is 10mm. Replace this sensor before you replace fuel pump, injectors or MAF etc. This is an easy repair and cheap.
B00B4DTRVA|4|Haven't 8 stalled them yet but they look to be the correct ones.
B009AA8PLM|2|Got these from a different site and I would not recommend them. the rebound is much too fast. after going over a speed bump slowly the truck will bounce twice before settling; feels like a worn out shock but they are brand new. I wish I would have kept my 11 year old rusty shocks. lol.
B000COA1K8|4|Very nice product but if you are installing them on a 97 or newer it is a bit more work as the directions give no details for the 97 or newer.
B001GJ3DZS|3|I hate the fact that there's no neutral selection to choose without giving this particular product a score it might not deserve. But this rating is for wheel brushes in general and again not this particular make and model. I bought it thinking I would need it but after trying I don't see why you would need this type of product at all. Why would you use this when it will scratch your rims (the Bristles are soft but not that soft) and also when you can easily use a microfiber cloth which will clean it better. The only time I can think of when you would need an actual brush is if you've neglected your wheels for many years and there's many years of hardened buildup, otherwise for those who wash their cars at least once a month or even twice a month, a microfiber cloth will wipe it clean easily.
B005CNNLRY|5|I got them for my 2014 Ford Focus se 5door. They look great are very tough, and fit perfectly.
B000BTB2DY|5|Great looking sticker, great buy!
B000FGCX0Y|5|Drop in replacement filter for Mitsubishi ralliart colt 4G15T mivec. Improvement in induction noise, turbo spooling and bov sound. HP gains? No idea but I guess its marginal at best. If you're looking to get more aggressive spooling sound then this is the filter for you.
B00M3ENQXE|5|Great price no problem programming it myself
B004SS8IS6|5|Clutch works great! My 04' F250 is running like new again. Very happy customer.
B000VKRQBA|5|Fits Perfectly
B00WM2I9P2|5|gives out a lot of light, love it on my jeep wrangler
B00DWKWSTG|5|These are AWESOME! Easy to install and stylish, totally worth it.
B004DRUUXS|5|just like factory
B00D0XHFA2|5|Arrived on time and pleased with product
B002M4CAD2|5|excellent fit
B0009XQUKC|4|Quality item performed as expected.
B000CITLS2|5|excellent book
B0016J5ZQ8|5|works great. Was so glad to have bought original equipment for the motor replacement. was easy to install. Watch a video on Youtube and your good to go. Took me about 20 minutes to install it.
B00JOPNVCG|5|Just what I needed!
B0094FZ5KM|3|It's ok, thought is was a felt tip and not a brush
B00GZR4N0K|5|Ordered to replace a faulty knock sensor on a 1995 Nissan Maxima.  Fit as expected and worked properly. A very affordable option to the OEM part.
B00L9J38V4|4|The color is much darker than seen here but it is of good quality and arrived on time.
B000NO7NC6|5|Worked with a Durafon, but very tight. I was able to do a little filing on the duraphone to get it working well. Much less expensive than the OEM part and works just as well. Also works on any other phone that you can stick or screw the tab to.
B00HU6N3LK|5|It just works.I wish I knew about this 5 years ago. I could have saved myself a lot of money if I just bought this product instead of other crappy brands of leather conditioner and cleaner.
B000J1Y33A|5|Outstanding tool. Well built. its hard to get your money's worth these days, But this tool is worth every penny.
B00IX5MRD2|5|As everyone says, SUPER easy install. Make sure you have a plastic trim puller so you do not scratch your paint. I currently have the Audi symbol but I might pull the chip and just go with the brighter white puddle light.
B00B2B4MSM|5|Awesome
B000C57VXM|5|So far so good. Will see for how long.
B002807VWU|4|c
B00KWMNI6Y|3|although i chose the ones to work with my vehicle i had to cut them down to fit.... lost about 1/2 of the mat
B002DZJQ0A|5|Saved me a trip to the toll booth.
B0016LEAVM|4|Wow I was surprised this actually works and now when it rains the water truly &#34;beads&#34; and runs off fairly well. Not completely which is why I gave it only 4 stars. Probably not something you really need but it does help especially in rainy areas!
B010E9Y5R0|5|Nice quality.  Fits my 2016 Ford Fusion.  Half the price as the Ford dealer.
B0057UJYDC|4|Good quality. Very accurate. A little hard to use.
B00CFALFXY|5|These are great for stainless appliances, ceramic stove tops and granite countertops.  Much better than cotton dishtowels for eliminating streaks.
B000C57W7C|1|Doesn't fit my 2006 gmc Sierra
B0012WW4D6|5|Works well, fit great into the 2007 saturn ion.
B00BITLMC2|5|Cheaper than then name brand auto stores.
B0007OWD2M|3|Honestly.  I can't tell any difference between the glass I cleaned with Invisible Glass and the glass I cleaned with Glass Plus.  I used both micro fiber towels, newspaper, paper towels and i get the same results.  Personally, of all the jobs in detailing my cars I despise glass cleaning the most.  The streaking drives me crazy, it constantly gets dirty and the angle of the windshield is such a pain in the butt to get to that it makes proper cleaning very difficult.<br />Still looking for that magic product that will do it all.
B00NWGS5A6|5|Good
B000F09CF4|5|breaks loose everything I've used it on.
B002662IJC|5|Perfect fit for my Chrysler Town & Country 2002 Lxi.  Easy to replace with help of YouTube video. I also received it very quickly.
B00KBBL4H6|5|Great tool for hard to reach tire stems
B00068XCQU|5|Nice tender. Works well. I keep the pigtails attached to the motorcycle battery and have them hanging behind my seat. So charging without removing the seat is easy.
B00A93UNL4|5|great product and shipping
B00GJK4X8U|1|toools ok  for single repair .to do more need better pump and gun
B010MX4N0W|5|Finally was able to install this kit. Pretty easy n straight forward. I was able to reuse my original 12mm nuts to secure the new plate kit on my 2015 Grom. Wiring was simple to wire up n then tuck away after testing them out to make sure it works;turning signals n tag lights. Replaced the flash relay with the one provided n works flawlessly! There's two things... When signaling now it makes a loud noise to alert me n passers by, which I don't mind. Second, I have temp tags bc I just purchased them. For some reason the plastic license frame used doesn't align. Hopefully when I get my real plates it will, if not, I will have to drop a star after my update. But other than those two things, so far, I love it! Lights are bright n turning signals let me know I still have the blinkers on! Nice kit
B00OIQ3ZYU|3|All else fails on ur motorized bicycle invest in this kit
B0016C5YF2|2|Good idea but cheep junk, broke on first use. Think of a car antennae that the metal is so thin a light wind bends and breaks it.
B00HJJETPW|5|Quality parts, bolted right on, work like a charm.
B005GSFWQ8|5|Works great! Clean lens first,use carefully. If deterioration is really bad a sanding type process may be necessary or &#34;Bite the Bullet&#34; and replace the headlamp or window or whatever the item may be.
B004HE0B8Q|5|Great product they made noise for about a day after that silence.
B005VWS5W2|5|Fixed the power door lock problem. No issues thus far.
B004KKDNNM|5|Stops the backflow!
B007KSY5W4|1|The motor took forever to get here and when I put it in my RV it did not work. All it did was heat up!!!. It's possible I just got a bad motor but the problem is it will cost $4.00 to ship it pack and the motor itself cost $4.00. Not worth the time or the extra time. I just put the old motor back in and it works fine.
B0126YHPQY|4|These are larger than standard OEM bulbs.  Luckily, at least for my vehicle, the reverse lights are pretty much the only bulb of the rear three (brake, reverse, turn) that I can actually remove. I have a nice compartment that pops off to expose all three bulbs, but it is a Toyota. It was engineered for smaller hands, it seems. Long story short, one of my kids will have to help daddy change his other bulbs. I'll turn in my man-card later today.<br /><br />Okay, to the point:  These bulbs are bright and functional.  Yes, the look a bit goofy in hand, but once you install them, no one will ever know. My only complaint are the lead wires. They look and feel as if you have one shot at installing properly.  Hose up and you may snap or lose the wiring - or worse, have to dig them out of your connector.<br /><br />Otherwise - good to go.  The company sent a promotional sample for evaluation without promise of a review.
B00MRSNH9E|5|Great item
B0031GXBN8|5|Good as original.
B00BJNTHP6|5|Excellent in timing in the ability to verify that this is for my vehicle and the price you cannot beat for a genuine Hyundai part. A combination that beats all odds and keeps a customer super happy.
B00C7P12EO|4|not quite as heavy duty as I would like but is easy to use and makes the front of the trailer a lot more stable
B00F23BNUG|1|I cant believe these bulbs are not under warrantee ,they began to flicker 1 month after I received them I bought the more expensive ones for my RV so they would last and they were the brightest which was great now I have 2 bulbs with 4 to 7 leds on each bulb not working at all , looked up on my acct and it says the warrantee is not covered ,I cant believe it ,I have bought many items with amazon for years ,they are only a few months old , ! If I don't get credit for the bulbs I will never buy anything from your company again ,so I would like to here from you hopefully a call or by Email !thank you
B00YI3IGA6|1|Doesn't work with Toyota Camry 2006- the window slopes too much and the back half of the product slides up and won't stay in place. Nice idea though, wish I could use it!
B00PBENGUG|5|I love this set best investment I made in a long time fits my 2009 Chevy Aveo just fine.
B000FW2MCM|1|Doesn't work anywhere I tried in my car.
B00OVW01YS|5|These bulbs are bright, and I mean bright. They auto dim just like the factory bulbs when you close your door or open them. The door foot flood bulbs light up the floor nicely when you want to make sure you won't step in a puddle. I had one issue where the reverse lights were bluer than the rest and they mailed me the correct bulbs no problem.  Was really surprised how toyota used the same bulb for almost all the interior lights and I highly recommend LEDpartsNow bulbs as an upgrade to your 07-13 tundra crewmax lights.
B00TDOGY18|5|Five Stars for the Stripper Smell!  The others are 3 stars
B00PBO0Z3M|5|Received the item the following evening!  Installation was a breeze, new lenses make the trick look new.  Had to adjust the driver's side this was a snap!  My daughter told me the headlights were extremely bright. That was my goal.  For the price I may even buy new ones for my wife's truck.  I will recommend this product and company and will buy again!
B00REQ1QV0|5|Fit great!
B0081RKOEG|5|works great!!!
B00GBVHQB8|4|The size run small I have XL hands so I order XL and the XL fit really tight on my hands but they are nice gloves
B0081SAMRO|5|As described, works great
B003M2IKVE|5|Working perfectly
B006AC7MKS|4|My detail guy does NOT like any dusters as most of them hold in the dirt and then the next time you use them, the dirt settled in the duster scratches the next time you use it, especially those California car dusters!<br />This one is the best I could find that you can spin it to get the dust out so it doesn't settle in the duster. it's very light weight ad you barely need to touch the car.  Just don't dust you car when it's heavily dusty as that will scratch your car.  We have classic cars and use these instead of other dusters.
B0117EESNC|1|Definitely not 16,000 pounds. Cracked the second I pulled up with a 12,000 pound RV.
B005SB6S3Y|4|pulled 26ft camper 180 miles round trip, every thing seemed to work as it should.
B00CYU3J8Y|1|Material is cheap as hell, no instructions ANYWHERE, broken link for product support on the website and HORRENDOUSLY overpriced to boot! Stay away from this garbage!
B002I0GYZU|5|Awesome Plugs and best price on Amazon!
B00ONO67HE|5|Shipped quickly! I would have preferred better pics on the instructions, but ultimately, easy and quick to install. It fits great and looks amazing!
B00V2V86H0|5|Once in a while, you find just the product you have been looking for.  I’m very particular about keeping the lens on my eye-wear clean.  While there are many decent lens cleaning cloths, these “Only” cloths are the first ones I’ve found to be great!<br />Eyeglass retailers recommend cleaning lens with a small amount of cleaning liquid.  Most lens cleaning cloths are rather slick and only somewhat absorbent so it is difficult to remove the last bit of liquid and the smudges it creates.  In contrast, these “Only” lens cleaners completely absorb the liquid and clean the smudges quickly, easily and effectively!  You can feel the absorbency and softness in these thin microfiber cloths.<br />Although I appreciate the honest and helpful reviews of those provided complimentary products, please realize I was not provided free samples and have no affiliation with the manufacturer or distributor.  I am a paying customer and my motivation for writing this review is to share my experience with those of you wanting the same qualities in a lens cleaning cloth.  Also, I hope the manufacturer and sellers do well so they can continue offer this outstanding product.
B0058J4MV6|4|Could line up better
B0002JMU2K|5|Looks just like the original cap, but actually provides a seal now!
B0042OV9HI|1|I got the product broken!!!!!
B0017Q6EEW|5|I received this 3 days before it was supposed to get here, was an easy install less than 5 minutes. Fired the truck up and was surprised at the actual sound difference it made!
B003TTTIZ2|5|Works great, actually holds 6 gallons easily, pours fast, I haven't got the clear hose yet.
B001CF1A7O|5|Very nice! Leave it on my atv to pull people!! Works perfect
B004CMDDOC|5|I've been using this product for years and it has to be one of the best cleaners for motorcycle windshields.  When using product routinely, the worse bugs to leave marks on your windshield polish right off.  This product also polishes other surfaces such as paint and pipes.  The kit I purchased is great for those long ride trips when you need to do some polishing.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.
B003ZWG6T4|3|Ok
B0017LZINK|5|2 years later and working great. 675 hp 12.7 Detroit
B0009IK5XA|4|Order received as expected but when ordering, there was no indication that the passenger side of the Juke was a different size than the drivers side so consequently I now have an extra 22&#34; wiper on the garage pegboard for future use.
B00O4K3T8W|3|good quality but they have a little lint to deal with if you are really picky
B004500M8G|5|After watching a video on YouTube , I decided to give it a try , please read instructions and use the product as the manufacture instructions .<br />It worked so far , no more water in engine .<br />Very happy with results .<br />I will update a review in few months
B00120MAQE|5|Fits 2011 tundra sr5 double cab really well.  Very happy with purchase.
B00HZB80Z4|5|i love these sticky pads, i never have enough room for my reading glasses, sunglasses and phone but with this product i do
B000N9OE1E|5|Like others said.  This stuff is for heavy oxidation.  Tip- buff compound in small area till the surface shines.  The follow up with a hybrid compound-wax. Before finally waxing for a brilliant finish.  Good luck!
B00IJJOUVO|5|Great looking sticker!
B00E1P3T0S|5|It worked nicely
B000II3N7Q|5|Love this. It really lights up
B00062YA8A|5|They should give you this with the air filter since it is required to run it with thier carb.
B0076AKISQ|5|Great product, easy to install. Match up center rib, eighth from either side of protective cover to the metal loop latch catch for hatch. Place cover on bumper to understand how it will fit. Then clean thoroughly with alcohol .I only removed the tape cover on the two rows closest to the body ,the one closest to the edge of the bumper I only removed about 8 inches and left a tail so I could finish removing it once it was in place. I made sure It was centered when first installing and making sure the edge of cover was closely lined up at the edge of the bumper. Holding the cover at the ends while installing gives you better control when matching the edge. While pushing the edges into the edge of bumper slowly let it drop onto bumper. If you like the fit ,.then slightly lift up edge of cover to pull out remaining tape cover off edge row. If you do not like the fit , lift up from the edge at a slight angle from the side without the protective tape removed ,pulling up towards the hatch opening. If everything looks perfect just apply pressure to the top of the cover where tape was  located .if anything goes terribly wrong, you can buy more of the tape at an autopaint supply store.
B000JFJLP6|5|A lifesaver. Takes the anxiety out of an undependable battery. My GF's car kept dying. The Jump-n-Carry jumps it every time.
B00MARZUI8|5|Great quality product. Fits perfectly on my 2016 Golf R. I don't have the DAP so no sensors to worry about here. Installation was fairly quick and simple, about 15 minutes give or take.
B0002UNON8|5|It worked like magic on my pearl white Infiniti g37. A red door hit my car and left a nice scratch. Bye bye!!
B004Q820TQ|1|It was inadequate and had to be returned.
B005G21JP2|5|Part was delivered on time and was an exactly fit.<br />Soon installed the step start working perfectly.
B00P5YOU3O|5|It fit with every toyota car .
B000KYXI3M|5|It arrived promptly and activated perfectly.
B002GYSXV6|4|Received the item and had also made three more of same item.
B008FWCLHU|5|Much easier to have a battery delivered than to have to carry it home.
B001CA54KS|5|Fixed all troubles with AC unit on car.
B00063WGV2|5|Easily removes chalky, sun damaged white paint from wing of airplane. Minimal work with buffer to make a hard, shiny finish.
B001AJKMTY|1|not of good quality. very cheeseie
B00GI77W6O|2|Bought a set at my local auto parts store. They work fine BUT they don't fit properly in my Toyota Corolla (2005) socket. The problem is that the depth of the OEM socket requires that the build have an approxemently .75&#34; shaft before the notch that locks the bulb in the socket. The pilot bulb only has approxemently a .50&#34; shaft.
B00PGCDDW4|5|Looks very classy on my Jeep!  High quality materials, easy to install.  Pretty cool.....
B000P7O5DG|4|Worked well with cooler
B00KGJ1SFG|2|Replica... Didn't fit perfectly.<br />1) Has a missing screw hole at the top right of frame<br />2) Top clips one was broken, other didn't click in properly<br />2) Side grille fins didn't get covered properly, sticking out at lower middle area<br />4) Don't recommend.<br />5) Meh<br /><br />Own MK5 R32...
B00J8QT9RC|1|It's fine if you like coconut pineapple.  It smells just like the pina colada tree airfreshner for $1.99.  I hate that mix and wanted pure coconut.
B001PL7RK4|5|I have been fixing my Hummer but I don't want to make it look too tacky the lettering is soft class
B00O9GU4UW|5|Very nice quality, straight forward install.
B000Q0VUC6|1|Does not fit application listed.
B004HDY8XQ|5|I bought these by mistake but was able to give them to a neighbor and they fit perfect
B00RHSEYG4|5|very quick getting it and just what l needed fits great
B00IMPEWHM|5|Perfect fit!
B0063MI7KE|4|these look awesome on<br />My 2002 Silverado but the reverse lights are backwards I had to cut the wires and extend the reverse lights. If you look the reverse lights on the stock lenses are on the bottom and on these there on the top. If you have any kind of wireing ability this is no problem just extend the reverse light wires.
B000BUOSGG|3|I find this just too small to really hold anything much after washing.  Not for large plates or heavy items.  It's going to my yard sale box.
B00WM3JENC|1|Habe only had it a month and it broke! Very disappointed, and with only a 30 day return!! Horrible
B00R5VFKNE|3|These don't fit right as they leave open spaces around the lower part. This is odd because I'm not hard to fit most eyewear. But despite them not fitting right still works fairly as my eyes aren't bothered cutting onions with them. That is why I give this a higher rating than if they didn't work at all.
B00VLEZ5B8|3|they fit but not like they shld very big compared to a lot of my other ones thst I use . wont be buying any more of these either
B001UEFEEM|3|purchased this in March of 2014, installed and run great until just back from vacation in July of 2015 then the misfire started on cyl. # 2, did all the normal troubleshooting switched the plugs and the coil wire. I still had the original coil and tried that and the misfire and error code 302 went away and has been off now for a month. It wasn't a bad product but I got over 90,000 miles on the original and only about 40,000 on this one
B00032KC30|4|Once I got them on, they seem like they are fitted securely and will stay in place, but it was very tough to get them on.<br /><br />They do look nice with my frame, as I had hoped.<br /><br />I could tell that when I first had them &#34;on,&#34; they were too easy to remove, but it seemed impossible to push them down any further.  I went to the garage and got a mallet, and tapped at the covers with that without success (I wasn't hitting very hard, because I was afraid to damage the covers and my car).<br /><br />I came in and read over the reviews and found that people were talking about a loud &#34;snap&#34;.  Well, mine made a loud snap even when it only snapped down on one side, leaving the other side up at an angle, so I think a better description is just to push them on as hard as you an until they are finally flush against the license plate frame.  It took me pushing on it with both of my thumbs while digging my toes into the concrete behind me for leverage, and I finally got them to click on securely.<br /><br />I hope I never have to remove them, because I don't want to go through that again.
B000GV1UJS|4|Great tool a ill catchy but I was able to make it work in a tight spot
B004F0HRLQ|5|Great!!
B00E7WEFQ2|4|Very cute but be careful because if you have a white vehicle it will put black marks on the hood
B000C7YKDE|5|The part came with very clear instructions and was easy to install. No complications in the car recognizing the new ignition switch. What took time was taking off and putting back on the upper and lower shrouds. Only problem: you now have 2 different keys.
B001553DP8|3|It was smaller than I expected but I still like it!
B007PKC6KK|2|Size was perfect for the bus I drive and the light a must for those early mornings when it's still dark out. Unfortunately, the clock didn't make it through one school year's use because one section on 2 of the digits are burnt out. (? not illuminating). Too skeptical to order another and it fail just as fast.
B00H6XPZN6|5|I am very pleased with this product. The window shades are well made, light weight, and easy to apply. they collapse down for easy storage when not in use. they provide adequate shade for my baby while riding in the car. I also appreciate the extra suction cups that come included. great product, great value! thank you!!
B010DDDEP6|4|Replaced old one just fine
B00YSKTEFK|5|This sticker is amazing. I got so many compliments on my car. People love it. I bought one at first just to see how it would look like just incase it didnt turn out to be the way I imagined it to be. It is beautiful.  I am actually buying a second one to put on the other side of my car. I do wish it was little bit bigger. Thank you for making this!!
B0064B3O84|5|good product and good price
B010H0QV00|5|Nice tool!  I was sent one for a review on Amazon, and after checking it out, I ordered two more, one for each vehicle.  This  DBPower 9 in 1 has a Digital Pressure Gauge and has many other tools that really rock.  It has a pair of scissors for cutting a safety belt, a flashlight with a clear and a red lens, a pair of pliers, a flat tip and Phillips screwdriver, and a serrated knife.  The knife could easily cut a safety belt as well.<br /><br />One other thing this 9 in 1 tool has that is really cool is the Window Breaker.  Just push the button and the Window Breaker pops out.  It is really heavy duty and has a point on it.  You just smack the window with the pointed end and it breaks right out.  It is the perfect tool for a vehicle to be kept in the glove compartment, or somewhere close in case of an emergency.<br /><br />The pressure gauge is great too, and it comes on with the press of a button near the gauge window.  To turn it off, just press and hold the same button for a second or so.<br /><br />The tool is very sturdy, and is very strong.<br /><br />The 9 in 1 has a switch on top.  Pressing the switch forward turns on a bright clear LED torch in the front of the tool, and the pressing the switch back turns on the bright Red LED.  In the center is off.<br /><br />The DBPower 9 in 1 tool is very well made and well thought out.  The layout is great and the tools are easy to get in and out.  It is an excellent item to have in your vehicle.<br /><br />In the case of your auto landing in water, just press the button on the Window Breaker and break out the side window to get out of the car.  It could mean the difference between drowning in the car or getting out to safety.  For that reason alone it is well worth the small price to have one in every vehicle.
B000K00DJ8|5|Great sound !
B0080DLA9E|3|Works well.
B00F49PQ9C|5|Easy install,  love the way it sounds,  best price I could find.  What more can you ask for?
B00WAAIKLO|4|not nearly as strong as factory, but for the price exceptable
B008Y9K3TW|5|Works great haven't had no trouble with this great job people
B00JHISQPM|5|Great stickers, good service.
B00T6J34OA|5|Awesome light, way brighter than the halogen light I had on there before.
B009DJVS78|5|Fast shipping ! Looks great for the price, can't go wrong with this purchase.
B00T2XIRK6|5|Best car mitt i've found.
B00XZ9N1JU|5|Arrived 4 days earlier than expected. Was easy to program and works great. Only 2 negatives: the programming instruction website included was for Ford and i have a Nissan. Upon opening the envelope, there was also a small gouge on the side near the keyring opening.
B004WMDXRE|5|Part was easy to install, a good price and works great.
B000BO913C|5|Used this to reapply the metal 400E badge on a 90's Mercedes, it is very thin tape so the logo sits very flush to the body work and looks the same as stock. I applied the badge over 2 years ago and the tape has withstood the Middle Eastern (up to 130 F heat) with no sagging or deterioration.
B005NLQAHS|5|works great! hassle free,<br />iPhones do not detect it (does not show in bluetooth search)
B001EMTQMQ|5|Looks and works exactly as advertised. This is a very high-quality product. Velcro mounting system is very strong.
B000WK5R6U|4|My 93 Nighthawk had became a pain in the butt to ride, twenty miles at most. The shocks brought that like new ride back.
B007HROL7M|5|if you own the Equal-I-zer hitch (Which is the greatest hitch) you will need these replacement parts.  If you forget to remove the bars when you back up your camper sometimes you can bend your pins.  I always keep an extra set in the camper.  we Love the hitch system
B00S4PL6TM|2|Was expecting good things from this towel only to be let down. I have a few good drying towels but wanted to try this one out based on the reviews I read. The towel didn't fully dry the area totally, it would leave slight water spots no matter how many times I got the excess water out of the towel. Not satisfied with this product.
B00KMSGZAO|4|have not yet installed these yet but have used them in the past and they do a good job nice an bright
B001E1UZDQ|5|Have a Nolan Hatch Helmet, where the whole front comes up, it comes with a snap something like this but much easier to use.  Had an old prong type connector for my wife but I had to snap it on and off each time.  On an Older Helmet ( very easy on and off) and my Wifes, I installed one of these on each one.  No trouble, you may have to use a screwdriver to muscle the strap in between the space but a small item.  Works phenomenally  very easy on and off and aside from being plastic it works well, This is way easy to use, why waste time weaving a strap in and out each time you use a helmet.  For the price of this you need to just buy it and save at least 15 seconds securing your helmet.  This is a no brainer.
B0060OJX1M|5|EXCELLENT PRICE AND QUALITY.
B001JT98S6|5|Perfect to wire trailer into DC outlet in car. Exactly what I needed!
B00CF5LMX2|5|Perfect ordered from this seller this is the drivers side light. Easy to install and saved a lot of money
B004X973EA|5|great stuff
B00KJ8JCKW|5|First time purchasing a hid kit and I am really impressed. Purchased the 5000k and couldn't believe how white the color is which is exactly what I wanted. Only had the kit installed for 3 days now with no problems but I will update if anything occurs.  UPDATE Feb 22 6 months later and still going strong !
B00D3YEGO6|5|Purchased as a birthday gift and when it arrived, it was even prettier than the picture. Came packaged in a classy box that protected it during shipping. Very pleased overall
B000XJG304|5|Sturdy vinyl patch
B001EYGDUW|5|This tire cover is subtle but looks very nice when seen driving, especially at night.
B005HR17RG|1|didn't work for me
B008I2OZIU|4|Good stuff. Easy to use.
B000AP452E|3|The Knob looks great and feels great.. but is a victim of the &#34;universal&#34; shift knob application design. The allen wrench installation never keeps the shift sturdy and during some hard shifting will come loose and will have to re tighten again. True enough you can maybe get some loctite and play around with it but that's a mod after a mod. Fresh out the box as is though.. 3 out of 5.
B004RCWZDM|5|The only negative for me is the door, not as good as I had hoped. We bought a magnetic screen for the next time we put it up, you can go in and out without constantly zipping it open and closed. With grandkids coming in and out we wondered how long that zipper would last. Having the extra room enclosed like that was great for our dog and a place to put fishing gear etc.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Love my new trunk organizer. Lots of space for dog leashes, water bowls, water and potty bags, plus a flannel shirt and my recyclable grocery bags. Everything in its place instead of rolling around in trunk. Easy to find just what I'm looking for.
B00E90W0GO|5|perfect fit and very comfortable to use.
B00JXYHLCY|5|Received kit with all new parts, lube and gaskets.  Nicely packed, 1 yr warranty.  Just had it installed with no complications.  Cold air is blowing.
B001C4WKDS|4|Great for removing oxidation.
B0012TYX9W|5|very pleased with product  no issues of any kind
B00PKN8PDQ|1|cute graphic design, but the instruction guide doesn't match up to the sticker itself... the sticky part is reversed... but still a great idea tho, Yorkie FTW!
B000B8Y016|4|Havent gotten chance to use it yet but feels sturdy and would do the job
B00GHS7IGS|5|What a easy fix to a complex issue.  I was told I would have to replace my whole door panel @ $600. a piece.  Kind of pricey for 3 doors.  Bought this and watch some you tube vids and poof all my doors are working for very little $$.
B002V0LC18|5|Bolted right up with no problems.
B00SJU0R1A|5|easy install, perfect fit
B000BNS7Y2|5|Very good product
B002G47GE6|5|Fast delivery and accurate product description.
B00065L2D8|5|Very good product
B008C0ZWPI|4|Fits perfectly and keeps the car cooler.  Removed one star because it's a little cumbersome to roll and unroll and the product had some air pockets in the back reinforcing layer from imperfect bonding.  Afraid the air pocket will grow with use.  Will update review if I change my opinion.
B003XMOTI6|5|Great product
B004QFC1CA|5|I love this. I also have the matching clock. They look beautiful, almost like they were built in the bars themselves. Especially if you have 1 1/4&#34; bars. I had a hard time looking for something that didn't look cheesy. These are sleek.<br /><br />Along with the clock, the thermometer face has a rubber o ring around it that snaps into the handlebar mount for easy removal. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND REMOVING THEM WHEN YOU WASH YOUR BIKE. Water will get under the watch face and it's a pain in the ass to remove. Rain doesn't ever get in it, but if you spray water directly on it, it will.<br /><br />**EDITED 09 OCT 2015**<br />I had an issue with the thermometer dial rotating as I rode, and I tried several things to fix it myself.  Turns out, it had a slight defect in the dial.  I contacted the seller and he replied within minutes with a possible solution to the problem. (Turns out he was right). He sent me a replacement dial in the mail.  This was the best customer service I've ever encountered while dealing on Amazon!  Very, very satisfied!
B008YFTB4E|5|Love them a lot brighter than stock lights
B000C1F8NQ|2|Cheap made in china..... 3 perforations without thread and the rubber gasket did not fit correctly. I had to installed anyway, hope it last
B005MZZ5TY|5|Love it
B001NZ6RJ4|2|the price is perfect, but the holes where you screw the bolts for the shocks are a little bigger, so you cant use the 5/16 bolt, I have to buy 3/8 tap tool to make treads for 3/8 bolt, did not found this issue until the arm was installed, used this for a 1997 Lincoln town car
B00112VLNQ|3|Nice design. Gloves fit very very snug for a XXL.
B000EVYGQY|5|Works great! Got rid of my ABS code that other readers are not cable of finding. Best bang for your buck!
B0070N2YTU|5|Awesome company near perfect customer service and clarity on these bulbs were great.
B00KMR3GT8|1|Never got it to work right! Took it to an install shop and they said it was junk and put in another system.
B006TMMYXY|5|Perfect fit. Works fine. Very happy with the price for the purchase. Saved a lot over the cost at a repair shop and husband could pop it in easily.
B00X9Y2H8M|4|Not a bad pack. There were a few licensed stickers in the pack. Mine only came with 98 stickers but I am not going to ask for a refund or anything. This is a good variety of stickers with something for everyone. This shipped UPS and arrived on a Sunday so that was awesome. Be advised the packing does not keep them from getting bent. Some of mine got bent but I was able to flatten them out using a book. I was hoping for more band stickers but this is not a bad set all. Giving 4 stars because some were bent.
B002M695I8|5|Usual outstanding Wagner quality.  Immediately felt the difference from the old OEM Honda rotors.  Best single word to describe these rotors...solid.  You may pay more for Wagner, but I consider brakes a no-compromise area of vehicle maintenance. Be sure to get the Wagner pads to go along with the rotor.
B008W4OODU|5|Can't wait until October!
B00MF5FRV0|2|Will not hold charge for more than a few days. Waste of money.
B0010E3IW2|1|Bought this because it said that it fit my car. Wrong filter
B00BSEPNMM|4|Fits nice and does the job keeping the bugs off my truck. Easy to clean as well.
B000OV7Z1M|5|It is a pan, it is durable, it works
B000KKLLFS|5|Cheap and do the trick...
B00V4049K2|5|Great product!
B00HRXTP2W|3|This product said it was for my specific Subaru with clamps specific for cross bar mounts on the roof. the box arrived and the clamps are not the right ones for my cross bar, so I had to spend and extra $30 to find the correct clamps. A little disappointed with that.
B005PZMKZI|5|VEry fancy for my 2004 grand jeep cherokee!!very happy
B00390BS7C|5|must have for o2 sensors
B00473V668|5|works good
B00188ZJGI|5|Great
B000NVW1LM|3|as advertised , I bought for a frined that wanted it , he is using it in his leaking hydraulic jack ?
B00OYC58XO|1|The size is not what the seller described, it is smaller.
B001RBQF4G|3|Good
B00V92U9RW|2|I've been battling an issue with my car not starting right for a while - and one of the main problems was a dead fuel pump. I replaced it with this one - it seemed to work for getting the car to start but I had the same issue with rough idle. Took it to a shop back in January and have had other work done as well - and the mechanic told me today that he tried to start it and couldn't - he did a fuel pressure test and there is zero pressure from the pump, it doesn't turn on at this point either. I think I just got a failed pump - but I think the lesson here is to look for the right pump, not one that Amazon shows will fit and is more cost effective. I believe I've found the right pump coincidentally on Amazon still - so I don't mean to lambast anyone for the issue I've had - but want to let people know that they should find the right pump from the auto store - and purchase from Amazon only if you can find the same pump the auto store offers for a better price - try to be frugal but stick to OEM specific parts.
B00S7S7C58|5|Everything was as expected
B000VQ8JY2|5|Go Browns
B0095EH33O|5|My 2005 Jetta had this and I didn't now how much I used it, until I purchased my 2015 Jetta and it didn't come with it. My 2015 had the holes drilled  on the inside top of the trunk and they aligned perfectly. Came with the hardware (screws etc.) to attach. It took my husband no time at all (no longer than 5min) to put it in. I am very happy with it, feels sturdy like my 2005 hook.... no complains at all. Plus I received the part in a shorter time than was estimated.
B0079SJ0B6|5|it very good bulb
B0001EFSTI|3|Looks like a key, wish it had more blade. Thought I'd get use to but I don't like having to disconnect from the key chain.
B00BITR21M|5|Fit my 93 Toyota Pickup perfectly.  Its only been a month but no problems so far.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Work perfect.
B007NQ7LSI|5|bought this with the recommended rivet puller.  It fits perfectly as it should and has the added bonus of utilizing the ignition key so it is a great, effective and simple solution!  Outstanding.
B007TY8CLO|5|fit my 2004 ford focus perfectly!
B0038B18CW|4|Very beautiful halo lights, you've gotten many compliments, changes the whole look of the car. Looks like a brand new car. The halos are perfect. Here's the problem, the main headlights cannot be made into HID's without performing surgery on these headlights. The bulb fitting is very different then the toyota OEM coming off and the fitment just isn't there. I'm a professional so a lil surgery, gorilla adhesive and a lot of F bombs with do the trick. At night time, there is barely enough light to brighten your path. Definitely a day time driving show-off head light. Oh and by the way, these may be Anzo USA, but they are made in Taiwan. Figures. Solely because they are NOT HID compatible I give these lights 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Lastly, they come with 1 year warranty. AnzoUSA stands behind their products. I strongly suggest you cash them in for new ones before then as these are my 2nd pair !! Keep your sales receipt, trust me ❗️❗️
B005JU5VH8|5|These are the best wiper blades bar none!
B00BZO51MW|5|very cute
B00435MNGM|1|never buy it again
B00T3C768A|1|I have to modify my rating, after a few months, the grill has yellowed and I have had to pay to get it painted black. Don't buy the silver.  I made the right choice going with silver, it looks so good. But I thought my father in law could change out the grill semi easily... Nope not even close, I ended paying a mechanic $150 to switch it out. Which isn't bad, it's definitely not something you can do with a couple tools at home. They ship the product from China with the wrong size rings but quickly sent the right ones out. I was bummed I paid for next day delivery but over all I'm very happy. I get lots of compliments
B000CSQHQQ|5|:)
B0113ILURE|5|Finally a sunscreen that works great and isn't a pain in the !!! To install. I live on n Las Vegas where we know sun. This is everything I was looking for.
B008US97XA|5|Without the adapter I would still be installing the lights.  They are great and needed.
B004QCBLJC|5|perfect little pieces for batteries.
B00B5WJHSI|5|These lights are show stoppers.  They really light up the night.  I was coming back from Yellowstone and hit the brights.  I could believe how bright it got.  There was some construction reflectors and these lights hit them all.  I seek out dark spot just to turn on my brights.
B003FXNCQS|5|Just as shown
B00UYDFCJC|5|Wore this for two solid weeks 10 plus hours a day in 90 degree plus heat and bright sun. Travelling from Virginia to Key West Florida following US Rt. 1 and back on secondary roads.  It was more comfortable than a short sleeved shirt when moving and not as hot as my jeans when stopped.  Size is just about right, room for a light jacket under it.  I cannot speak about the removable liner since it rode with the gear all the way. nor can I rate the armor, I hope never to have to.  The bright color caught the eye of inattentive drivers several times and saved me from having to take evasive action.
B00QRCQNU6|2|I loved this thing!  But it didn't last long.  He fell off when I went through some branches in the neighborhood, and then he flew off on the highway.  He was just too top heavy for the antenna.
B003YJJS2U|5|Fits the electric jack on my Casita travel trailer perfectly!!!!
B00HWS7XGW|5|WOW! These are distinctly brighter than factory incandescents, as viewed from all angles, while mounted in my Smart ForTwo 450.
B00KTIBY4Y|4|This item shipped very quickly and reached my home within 2 days. It was a perfect fit and took only a quick minute to switch. It took me longer to get my key on the ring than it took to switch the key fobs.
B00RIU09C4|5|Worked out just like I hoped it would thank you
B00UUSV1P0|5|Coming from a firefighter these are an excellent tool to have and they work very simply and well .. I carry one attached to my bunker gear and use it quite a bit when we're on an accident scene and need to get a seatbelt off of someone, or get a side window out of the way. ..everyone should be carrying one of these for their own safety and you never know. .maybe someone else's as well . .  I will say this  . .DO NOT attach this to your rear view mirror. .  in a serious accident there is no guarantee your mirror will still be attached to your windshield..and your resqme wont be there either.
B00F1UCLB0|5|perfect fit, good deal.
B013ME9PII|5|This is such a well made, clever, and simple design that it is absolutely a must have for every motorcycle rider! My Son and I love ours and use them every time we ride! Get one or two or three! Give the extra ones to your friends! You wont be disappointed!
B009RIURTK|3|I thought these would work better at slower speeds.  There is some imbalance up to about 35 mph, but from then on it's smooth.
B0081O5XU4|4|Easy Install .  Worked great and looks good
B005G7Y4Y0|5|Exactly what i needed
B00GSAUHB8|5|This is extremely light and covers the entire inside windshield of my 2011 Santa Fe. It also folds up to fit within the carrying case. It replaces a big bulky sun protector I had that constantly fell down. A really excellent product. I love it!
B00D3RDBJ4|5|wasnt sure about purchasing it..but It works great.
B007HRJNIE|5|Thanks
B002PLGL1Y|5|Been a month and a half so far and it's holding up great, no problems, fixed my cylinder mis-fire. Will update if anything happens. Order more than one because if one of them goes out, most likely at least another 1 or 2 more will also go out later.
B004AHGEJU|4|this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements
B000C59ZUY|5|Was a easy install and took no time to get it done
B00EI6CKVE|5|Just have to love this one
B007EHOWNI|4|I have read reviews that this product has not held up well or lasted very long, so keeping my fingers crossed.  I purchased this to replace an existing OEM antenna for a 2003 Lexus RX300.  Like others, I have forgotten to turn off my radio when going through a car wash hence the bent mast which eventually broke at the base.  A few years ago I had to replace the whole part, motor and antenna as the motor just wore out, so I was painfully aware of what could happen if the cable had broken off this time.  While replacing the motor is not that difficult in itself, the tear down of the cargo area and reassembly was not something I was looking forward to again as it is time consuming and just a pain.<br /><br />When I first tried installing this I could not get the cable to grab.  On the Lexus the teeth face forward on the vehicle, I must have tried this at least 5 or 6 times turning the radio on, mast extended full length and cable in as far as it could go and then turning off the radio so it would grab and retract the cable as it should.  When this was not working I realized that this cable is just a bit larger than the OEM product so as it goes, &#34;if there is a will, there is a way.&#34;<br /><br />What I did to fix this was I took my Dremel and sanded off a bit and about 1&#34; to 2&#34; inches length on the smooth back side of the cable and a bit on the sides of the the cable.  Then I took a utility knife and cut the tip into a V shape.  Once I did that on the very first try the cable grabbed and retracted the antenna perfectly.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 star review is because I did have to make a slight modification to make it work on my RX300.  Hopefully this will hold up and I won't have to comeback and change my rating or opinion.  I hope this helps others planning on doing this themselves versus a mechanic or dealership which will cost alot more.  I would also like to add that yes, this can be done by yourself, I am a 5'1&#34; female and I didn't have any help.  What I did was open the cargo hatch, laid the extended antenna on top of that; opened the passenger door once the cable was in place and turned off the radio...had to be quick because once it grabs it is fairly fast but can be done.
B007HRGZDK|5|Good stuff
B00POG2WR4|5|They are so cute and I get compliments!  HA!
B007F9FK68|5|Great
B00DN3IKAI|5|Works great
B00W2DIOWE|3|cheap. it has an uneven outline where its cut, white shows around the edge of half the sticker. You can see those print lines from a cheap printer, low resolution, and the material is flimsy unlike the other stickers ive purchased from this seller.
B00F0QAOOG|5|Easy installation
B00I8U173I|1|Poor quality
B000E4NRFC|5|great buy
B0085IIYD4|5|Easily removed black streaks from my rv.  Great stuff!
B00063V40G|5|Item as described
B00HXJKE6Q|5|Awesome Helmet !!!! It is very comfortable, light, and it has plenty of ventilation. Great for off road !!! Most importantly, it has room for the Sena bluetooth module. Full face shield that you can upgrade it to a tinted full face shield. Washable cheek pads and liner. Extremely durable !!!
B004C0IA1K|4|Another fine quality product from standard
B007NPO34E|5|Perfect fit for rear 2004 dodge stratus. Stock look
B00KQXKG46|4|only thing i can complain about is the brackets that are sent with it. comes with the ends on it already and a longer cable than i'm used to. but the brackets will be replaced. it is very bright i'm content.
B000WJ9M8A|5|This is an exact replacement for my 07 Harley electra glide. Fixed my idle problem and now my bike runs so much smoother and my fuel mileage has gone up to where it was suppose to be when I bought it new
B00JDXMD32|5|nice OE fit
B00OXBTWK6|5|Great compact keychain.  Also the ring release is a convenient feature as well!
B00JXEL1VG|5|Really nice! I was worried I would end up with something cheap and cheesy and this cover has a soft leather feel.  I really like that the blue pattern isn't overwhelming.  I have had this for months in my Mountaineer now, and none of the blue stuff has peeled or faded.  I am very impressed.<br /><br />*Update: I have now had these cover for a couple of years, the blue color has faded but the quality of the item has not! It is still soft and hasn't peeled, cracked or ripped! Fantastic stewing wheel cover and very worth the cost! I highly recommend this!
B00JJ3R8RC|5|Fast service and good quality.
B00SDL2SG2|5|Received as expected
B004BSHC9Y|5|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS BRAKE BOX CONTROLLER.  I have been trailering horses for many years and this is without a doubt the BEST brake box controller I have ever used!!!!  It is so nice not to have to constantly adjust a brake box every time I'd get in my truck either because I was adding another horse or just because the weather had changed.  I no longer have to smell burning rubber from my tires and brakes because I was using the standard type brake box.  Most places you go to have no idea what a &#34;Proportional Brake Box Controller&#34; is, so they install a standard towing brake box because it's cheaper.  Plus they don't have a clue as to what a &#34;Proportional&#34; Brake Box Controller is.  This is not only saving my truck and trailer brakes, but my trailer tires from wearing out faster.  I love the fact that the &#34;Hayes 81792K G2 Brake Box Controller&#34; automatically adjusts to doing exactly what my truck is doing whether I'm coming to a stop, going around curves or down hills.  This is absolutely the BEST thing since sliced bread!!!!<br />on the market and as you can see I highly recommend it.
B00NF1Q2FS|5|Part works great.
B00BOWR10U|3|Item was as expected. Took forever to receive the product. Did return it and had no issue with that process
B00IXDN0Y4|5|Work awesome. Well made and bright.
B00T94V1QK|3|Fit on 2015 Civic is ok on front door double sided tape used to mount is not very good not sure how long it will last, the scuff plates for back door of  my 2015 will not stay on as contours of area to be applied to is curved.
B00GMA855O|3|Lights work well..super bright. The fitment is not good . I had to modify to fit in my use . The LEDs stick out pass the round ends like wings . I will leave a pic of what they kinda look like due I already installed mine. For the price a good value thou.
B000CBDDQK|5|bought 4
B001BWE7DC|5|works well
B002H8M96Q|5|Real nice, does retain small air bubbles.
B000W0RQ8C|5|Works perfectly
B009DIWO2M|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B002ZQ7B9A|5|Just as described. Perfect accessory for my car.
B00JYMZ8HK|5|Used this a handful of times in RV parks when traveling with our RV. Seems to work great. It never tripped so I can't really say I have &#34;tried&#34; it out. But seems to do what its supposed to do.
B004D5SUIC|1|shipped wrong part . THIS DOESN'T FIT 2001 KIA SPECTRA ( when it said it did )
B002ELMUCE|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.

B002VR5LLI|5|Great alarm! Easily placed on bike.
B003ZS33DU|5|Nice hitch. 2 people and patience. Once it's on it is awesome.
B00A6AS6LY|5|works great, I have worked in a lot of shops and everyone else had one so I never bought my own, they work great, has most of all attachments, and the ones it doesn't have I use my pressure tester adapters to make it work
B00B1SZMNA|3|Pretty keychain but the silver emblem fell out in less than a week.
B009AA54BQ|5|the way to go on these Toyota tundras ,a lot cheaper than factory but just as good,and you get everything
B003XZFIF6|5|Another great Loctite product. Use it on plug wire ends for a watertight, trouble free connection.
B001PYAPAU|5|Great product
B00AC6TY0E|5|I have a set on my Raider, Outstanding comfort!<br />I am just not sure of the Part# and what it will fit on, Avon site part # and Description of fitment not correct.
B000CN5GEA|4|Fit well on my RV Freightliner Custom Chassis.  The only minor problem was with the washers supplied.  The kit did not have the correct sizes for both studs.  Only one complete set was supplied.  The grommets fit good and snug.
B00MA4MP4S|4|I like it, but I don't know if I would buy it again for the price.  This thing is a pain to put on properly, and if you don't have it smoothed out on all the edges, you'll end up with permanent bubbles.  I have a couple.  That doesn't impact the function but it definitely impacts the aesthetics.
B005KVLX50|4|Bought this item to haul my kayaks. It was definitely the right purchase for me.Very well built and durable. It is also durable enough to haul lumber that is longer than your truck bed. Good purchase.
B0093WA5C4|5|Fits old Case backhoe hydraulic filter housing. How old of a tractor are we talking about? One built in the early 1970's. Case Construction King 550.
B006N9CWO4|1|Only one came in the package and cost me to have only one of two installed.
B00E9G1F0K|5|The solenoid. as well as other parts I've ordered worked exactly as they were supposed to.  Mistakenly ordered two (2) solenoids but keeping both!!
B009LUQFMC|5|Easy to install and worked as advertised.
B00681BE2S|5|It worked great
B000UV961S|5|Really cuts down on the heat inside and protects dash board
B006DYFC0A|5|I had to send the compressor back because it did not fit my car. However, I had no problem with the return process. Thank you very much for your professionalism.
B00FF1K7BQ|4|Works good.
B00NS6YSCE|5|Fit my 2004 Tacoma perfect. They are very good shocks so far didn't realize how bad the old ones were.for the price can't be beat
B0067N4D9S|5|Under my Weber Q grill as we speak for the summer of 2015.<br /><br />Stays flat and does not move in the weather.<br /><br />Love the Cardinals theme.
B0030GDLYS|4|Overall, really good. I found a way to get it to control my Roku 3 (bought a basic Roku remote that uses IR and then taught the Universal Remote the buttons). What keeps it from 5 stars is that the range for this remote for the Roku 3 is quite limited. Works like a charm on everything else (soundbar and TV).
B0016C1Q22|5|Excellent price and quick shipping. Very pleased.
B00KTHZISI|5|Amazing deal
B000BZG8ZA|5|Great Product!
B004QEM784|5|Heavy duty. Very happy with the perform ache and quality.
B0089T0LA8|3|Worked for 1999 Blazer S10 2 door. Except as others stated,  gas cap didn't fit.  Now I have to get a cap.
B006TMRCUO|5|good for the price
B010H0QV7S|5|It is so amazing to be able to check my tire pressure and actually be able to read it.<br /><br />It works well.<br /><br />I was provided a sample product in exchange for an unbiased review.
B000OV9NRG|5|Had it about 8 months, pulled atvs, sxs's, trucks all out of the mud...still not frayed or broke!!
B00BPGGSCW|4|Works well but comes at a price. It is very expensive. The product smells great and cleans well but for the price I was only able to clean my wheels about 3 and a half times. Just not really worth me buying repeatedly.
B00LARS63K|5|Where have you been all my life?  Great for coming back to the car all sweaty and dirty after a hike or workout at the gym.  Easy to pop on and pop off.
B0013VT5N8|4|Fits well over my PA plate. Quality look and good protection. Have washed the car a number of times and water does not get behind the cover which I like.
B00COOR526|5|Oson very good 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
B0064QVEFY|5|I have over 250,000 miles on this and works great. Filters are lasting me over 60,000 miles.
B004HP19W2|5|Do yourself a favor and go K&N, reusable and about same cost of throw away
B00LEBLI82|5|I can't believe the price for these!  I was looking other places and it was going to cost $100 or more for the 10 lights I needed for my RV.  These fit just fine and the light is adequate, just like I hoped.  If they don't last I will certainly add another review to reflect that but for now these are wonderful and the price is right.
B000H5QIQS|4|High quality winch at a reasonable price.
B00AXPAEWG|5|Got these for a 2015 F-150.  Absolutely amazing tailor made custom fit.  They look like original upholstery.  Quality is superlative.  I have bought these same velour covers for other cars and they are always a perfect fit.  Worth every penny and more.
B00T8M6EBU|5|Just as described
B003C508XO|1|Lasted just over one month - three days longer than the Amazon return window allows.  I recommend Durite timer-off relays (available from ADR Components in the UK);  the Durite relays cost more, but the ones I installed four years ago are still working.
B0002SQYF0|5|Great price!
B008J151H4|2|Poor, weak sound, the beeping horn that came with my Soul is louder. Sounds like a deep pickup truck horn but weaker.
B0051E4AMY|4|Just what my wife needed for her 2000 Lincoln LS
B0075LD5JU|5|The spirits are always with you!!! Bohahahaha-- oh I mean this decal is.
B006OSNUZE|3|Develops a bad smell when it gets wet.
B004GEG2R6|5|Verry good
B0040D2QC8|5|Worked great and cheap.
B00T94V1QK|5|Love these. You do need to make sure you buy your own adhesive as the 3M tape isn't very strong. I used 3M glue...which is at Advance or any car place. And you must make sure you place them right on the edge.
B004PUZPQK|5|Nice
B00537CIHS|5|Heavy duty, easy fit on my Hawk Horse trailer.
B00MJ813NO|5|Exactly what I wanted
B004HEUJ3I|1|plug broke after one or two uses. male adapter plug stuck in bikes outlet and broke off. very poorly made. keep looking. It was only a few bucks or Id make a stink about a refund. Highly discourage purchase based on my experience.
B00336XFK0|4|I bought it for my brother's birthday since he got a new car and before I have given it to him I started crying because I thought it was the wrong size (I checked amazon and it told me that it doesn't fit) and it sorta didn't fit as snug than I wanted but in the end he loved it but hey it's comes comes with a nice leather bag but I wished it came with the bmw logo (p.s. He owns a 2011 BMW 335xi Coupe so watch out???!??)
B007RY0YF8|5|Second set I've installed, both working flawlessly. Both riders just rave over the difference.
B003VAX3IC|5|This makes for a much neater connection between the trailer and the tow vehicle. No more cable hanging down or getting tangled in the electrical cable or chains.
B00P9W8NLW|5|I NOW HAVE WHAT I NEED TO DO IT MYSELF
B00IMVNKOM|5|Used it once and it was awesome even with the low water lressyre the handle itself just feels quality. It's great but I returned because I live in apartment complex wasn't very practical...
B000GV268M|5|loud
B000EOGTP2|4|Should just come with the PCV Valve, but whatever.  Buy synthetic grease (if you don't already have some) when you buy this and the PCV valve.  Dry installation is basically impossible.
B00DP2UYE2|5|Great product fit perfect !!
B005SUVQUK|4|Item worked to remove the wheel bearings from my Honda NC700X rear wheel. Like others stated, it takes some getting used to, if you've never used one before.
B007DKQF68|5|Good part
B00X9H725W|1|I would give it less than one star if possible.  Total junk!
B000EBMKAS|5|This is the perfect organizer for all papers needed at a moments notice.
B003NGFFDA|5|worked Great!!
B001RLRYGO|5|Good stuff.
B00387RYRE|5|Very good product
B000BO9J52|4|Does what it says it will do. No complaints here.
B004N6YRDS|5|These lights are great. Several different options which make for a super cool custom ride. I have a 2014 Lancer Evo and they are such a good addition to the inside of my car. The only complaint is that, atleast on my car, it is difficult to mount under the passenger side console since it's not very flat. I used 3M tape but it falls off on occasion and I have to remount it. Not a big deal and probably wouldn't happen to your vehicle.
B00J7HBRL8|3|Looks great. Not sure about the durability or construction quality. But do look great for price
B001EOV3JS|5|Very well made , works like a dandy , easy to put in the spots it was designed for . I'm very happy with this product .
B0002SRH60|5|Works perfectly!  Hubs came right off with this tool.
B00BI3LRKK|4|TIME WILL TILL NOW GOOD THERE ARE
B00LB9HMZA|1|Not impressed, bottom has nothing to keep these in place, the passenger side slides all over the place.  For what these cost this shouldn't happen.  Weather Tech told me to put Velcro on them to help with the movement.  Here's and idea, design them so that isn't needed!  These things are way overpriced for what they are.  Wish I would have seen the Husky liners, they have cleats to keep them in place.
B000O5DUP8|3|its ok
B004HCS4NW|1|Did not get the dirt off my top. I had high hopes, but, plain and simple...my top looked no better.
B00OZUBHN0|4|Shipped fast and packed well. All lights worked and have a good green led color. Good Fitment in light socket..
B00VKM3S4C|3|Front is very tight on 2013 Rogue - cinch cord came unsewed first time used..
B006RXWVVA|4|Installed in my trailer, they work well.
B000C55LV6|5|Good stuff
B005KDOAGC|1|Would rate zero stars if I could. These are the same exact color as halogen bulbs and look nothing like HIDs. Don't be mislead by the blue tint on the bulb, it does nothing. You can get an HID conversion kit for cheaper than this. I have HIDs for my headlights and thought this would be a simple match to put in my fog lights but I was thoroughly unimpressed. I should've just kept my stock fog light bulbs in. In the picture I uploaded for my fog lights you can see the difference between a real HID (left) and these crappy things (right)
B00RIUP8VQ|5|perfect
B00MAURR40|5|Great fit!
B00H5F472U|5|Looks good......really good!
B0041TEKI4|5|Arrived on-time and works like a champ!  Truck is cool again!  I don't really think it's noticeably louder than the original.
B00F675E12|5|Great price for a factory OEM product.  Quick shipping.  Was unsure of installation difficulty, but my 16 year old popped them right in, took about an hour of time. Didn't even have to read instructions. Man approved!  Fits perfectly, and all the mounting hardware was included.  Makes our 2009 GMC 3/4 Sierra look great.
B00XXFW6C4|5|Very good
B00IDSIC1A|5|I like them work good and good price I will recommended yes
B001DH2U20|5|Easy installation, perfect fit
B004T5QB14|1|The box was incomplete and I am still missing screws for installation. Overall built is fine, mirrors are big and feel sturdy. I just wish I could use them.
B0009JKGII|5|I havent cleaned my rims since 2008 other than the usual car wash, as you can see from the pictures this product works, NOTE: i didnt take alot of time cleaning the rims they could definetly look better i was just too lazy to keep scrubbing, the pictures you see i probably spent 1 minute cleaning my rims
B00JEUHPUA|3|just as i figured, the paint isn't great and it had scuffs, i can't find anywhere to complain on here about it. because 60$ if far more than i'd like to spend on a product that has any imperfections. i'd feel better at half that price for a product that has any flaws. but it is easy to install and looks okay. havn't mounted a light yet but will keep and update
B00BWZ6ZBU|5|Worked as expected, no problems
B000RXKR6M|2|Seams came apart after first use. Still useable but shoddy product.
B00W8ADB1K|5|The HangPro Car Organizer by JACO Superior is just perfect for front and back seat storage! The main compartment is divided into 3 sections and is quite durable! It actually is quite spacious and I recommend one of these for every car! It is big enough to fit snacks, water, cell phones and so much more. I use it for every day travels with my son. I like that it isn't flimsy and is easy to install on the back seat. My car is also so much neater with things organized and not just sitting on the floorboard or in the seats. A real must-have for everyone! It is especially great  for on-the-go parents!<br /><br />Self Disclosure: I received a free product in exchange for an unbiased review. No other compensation was received.
B008OOP8NS|5|Great pair of boots. Feels like wearing slippers. Hope they hold up in the rain, my last pair from Tour Master did. Definitely worth the money. The insoles are cheap and thin, so if you are planning on adding a new one, might want to get a 1/2 size larger.
B005X4FGLQ|5|Just as advertised. Great product and fast shipping.
B000GU24HG|4|Don't let the price scare u , it's a great deal and it work an fits perfect on my gsxr 750 , I seen some for more money an they are no we're near as good as this one,
B00M5WYWPU|1|Hollow, white backing, and crap. What else do you need to know?
B00BCNB3EQ|5|Exactly as advertised. Great buy.
B00JINPJD8|4|works as stated keeps grime at bottom of bucket.
B00JBGAR9I|5|Looks great and went on really easy ! Go Hawks!!
B008S20GII|5|Just like the original
B00KTIQAZW|4|😀
B002M7MU2A|5|Works.<br />Only has one nozzle.
B003UM7B98|4|works great for changing tires on my car and truck
B00HY070CK|4|I love the way these light look in the car. I left my visor lights white ( wife and make up ) and my trunk light. They were easy to  install. I would have given them, 5 stars but the lights in my back seat area. The bulbs were a little longer than the old bulbs. They took a little positioning to fit and work.
B005MVB4RU|5|I've wanted one of these for a while. No need to wait. Buy it. It is best bang for buck. Quick connect. Long barrel bits and case. Perfect. Love it.
B002OUMVWY|1|Second one.  Both after about 3 months crack at the seams and of corse then leek.  We full time in a motor coach and we used to use these product a number of years back and never had an issue.  My guess...New supplier with poor, poor, plastics.  Look at the recent reviews and you will see crack after crack after crack.
B00X5EO6VC|5|now the learning of how to begins. at 85 thats a bit of a challenge lol.  but i have tackled worse problems before.  ever changed the spark plugs on a 2005 kia 3.5l engine?  ha,  now THATS a real challenge when you are 85. &#34;oh my aching back&#34;. but the vs600 scan tool showed the problem of a rough running engine in seconds after plug in. so after a quoted price of 360 bucks at a garage; doing it myself saved me over 260 dollars. owning a vehicle and not having a vs600 to  check your engine is like throwing money away.  best of luck and protect your fingers  hubert nolte  from vancouver island b.c. canada
B00B4ZFGBS|5|Fits factory perfect.
B00EM8944O|5|Very easy to follow directions and worked well on some light scratches.
B00FRHOC82|5|These work great on my 09 wrx and are still going strong after months of use
B00L2OVUXO|5|excellent for my 07 impreza
B00LBEMHKU|5|Fits great in my '15 GTI. GREATLY reduces the heat in the car. Looks the business, euro looking, and a great alternative to tint. Took about 30 min to install everything.
B00F7GXNX8|5|Just what I wanted and a good price.
B00W8ADB1K|5|Bought for wife for her truck seat loves it pops right of if someone needs the seat quick delivery.
B006LO4L6I|4|Perfect.
B0058EK88M|3|I bought these mates for my car. They said they would fit an Acura. They do not fit.
B000CB6ADS|4|These worked fine for my 2006 Mitsubishi.
B001O77CMW|4|I had to improve the 2 pins that hold the front as it was to lose.  a bit of cutting and welding job not anybody can do  but now it is firm and not shaky.
B001BAH5DI|5|I always use this when replacing my differential fluid and have to make a new gasket
B002UVGR54|5|Highly recommend it
B00TU5XT40|3|I bought this marine grade one because I live in Georgia and the sun is really intense. I called the company and purchased it because the shipping would only take a day compared to amazons who knows how long. When I recieved it I actually thought it was a mistake and they sent me the cheaper deluxe version because it looks nothing like the picture and it was so light and the top was so thin. They claim they can't make one out of all marine grade because it's too heavy but that's a stretch. The marine grade material is canvas not vinyl so it's actually a lighter material than the sides, and it's super thin, even doubled up its thinner than the side of a quarter. They company sent me a second one (again overnight) which turned out to be the same as the first but that's because the first one was correct just doesn't look like the pic and the top was thin so I thought it was the wrong one. It comes with plenty of straps but no instructions so I'm pretty sure I have it strapped wrong even now. All in all it seems like a nice cover but difficult to put on with no instructions, and I'm skeptical about the top material it seems really light weight and nothing like any boat cover I have seen even though they claim it's made from the same material as their boat covers. Time will tell I suppose but it's a lot of money to experiment on quality with. I will say the customer service is incredible so that's a big plus and hopefully this thing will last as long as they say.<br /><br />1YR later, it works well to keep the sun off, its kind of a pain to take on and off each time I want to use it but that's not the company's fault. Recently when I removed it I noticed it was ripped along a seam, and mind you I am very careful to cover all corners and keep it tight. The area where it ripped is on the bottom where you clip a strap to the opposite side underneath the camper to keep it from blowing off. I could understand if it ripped around a corner but this was on a seam that holds the clip. All in all its not a bad product, I have never had a cheap one so I don't know what they are like but if they honor the warranty I say this one was worth it, if not I wouldn't buy again because one more season and it will be no good.in all its not a bad product, I have never had a cheap one so I don't know what they are like but if they honor the warranty I say this one was worth it, if not I wouldn't buy again because one more season and it will be no good.
B005IDVL5M|5|Looks very well made ,but very grateful i havent had to use it yet,when and if i do i will rate performance
B00QVODY1G|4|Nice solid little light kit. It's got gaskets for the lenses and a drip hole at the base of each light. They should keep out most water while launching/recovering your boat. The wires have lots of length for most small trailers. These lights do not have a dedicated ground lead as some do. If you run a separate ground lead (as opposed to using the trailer frame) you'll need to terminate it in an eyelet to go around the mounting bolt of each light. Not as heavy duty as some but a very good value for the money.
B00R6S0MEI|5|I really like this style garden hose nozzle; I have purchased several through the years (Craftsman sells at a higher price).  It is well-balanced; easily shuts off completely (doesn't drip!), and you have your choice of spray patterns, from concentrated to bubbling.<br /><br />There is the same style but in aluminum; I prefer stainless steel or brass (this one) over aluminum.  The heavier metals just feel like they will last forever (although the aluminum ones I own haven't failed).
B00J5CVMCO|5|Works great and really helps keep wheels clean longer.
B006B266FO|4|it has a good bite while braking. It needs 300 miles to break in... It does sound like cicadas around u while braking.. But i care less about it unless it's a squealing sound !  I like it because if brakes well on VTX 1300
B0018CP0W2|5|works great
B00Y171U98|5|Very bright and nice color
B005SHR7D8|5|Installed on 2012 Cruze.  These are excellent brake pads and will not disappoint.  They are quiet and have solid performance.
B003UM7B98|4|So far it works as it's supposed to. It's very well made with a slightly rough finish. The only drawback that I've noticed is that it is very hard to slowly lower the jack. It takes only a few degrees of twist to go from the locked position to dropped position. There's almost no in-between. It serves my purposes though.
B00V7UUQXI|5|Works great and super bright!! Awesome light!
B007K1ZDT0|5|I'm very happy with my purchase. The lights are better than I thought they would be. I ordered the light on a Friday and received them the following week on Friday. The install was 40 bucks but it was worth every penny.
B00N9LMXUC|5|Perfect and works as expected replacing the “Basix Magic Shade Jumb”  Think before buying the Magic Shade at link<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQR100?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00
B00X2TUW1I|5|I have had these shades for a few weeks now and I love these window shades!!  I drive a Navigator and so the extra large size covers the windows well.  I have four small kids and when traveling someone is always on a side where the sun is shining in.  These shades have been our solution.  We can put them up when you need to block the sun or take them down when it gets dark.  Also, the shades have proven to be helpful in this Texas weather of 104 degrees to block the sun from heating up the car seats when car is parked outside.  I love the convenience of being able to just stick them to the window when you need them or pull them off and fold and stow away.  I not only recommend this product because I like it but the company is great to work with too!  I was shipped them and one shade had a small part that wasn't letting the shade open fully.  I emailed the company and another set of shades was shipped quickly!  Extremely nice company and good product.  I would definitely recommend buying this product!!
B00M9P23CC|1|Brand new Ryobi 2800psi 2.3 gal/min pressure washer. Used it 3 times. Added this stuff to the gas then tried to use the washer a 4th time to wash my car. Now the pressure washer won't stay running. Oil is good, fuel tank is full. After using Sta-Bil I have to run it with the choke full on to get it to idle. If I actually run water through it, the RPMs drop and the engine dies. I'll never use this again. I just hope my engine isn't shot now!
B005AWOF1S|3|Didn't have time for a DIY project.
B00W4JXBI8|5|Such vivid colors and so soft to the touch..I absolutely love it!
B00KQHVT5M|5|Exceeded my expectations
B008S9QUC2|4|utilizes the factory ignition key as it &#34;learns&#34; the key you use the first time and is effective for it's purpose.<br />Only note you need a DEEP socket to reach the locking lug-nut and not all lug wrenches will work.
B007WMH3YK|5|Much less expensive than a dealer part and made just as well.  My car has automatic transmission and requires a section be cut out of this part to give ventilation to the transmission's oil pan.  The part is etched where it needs to be cut.  Easy!
B013ME9PII|5|This is a great little invention that solves the age old problem of what to do with your helmet. It attaches easily and is barely noticeable, but when the time comes to stow your helmet it's right there at the ready. I've had mine in three different bikes now. A worthwhile purchase.
B000CRAUHY|5|Best oversize racing seat Ive tried! Made a custom mount to swap this in for the cruddy old bench seat in my S10 pickup, to give myself more headroom (6'4&#34;), and to move the goofy neck/shoulder wings where they belong. This seat has a nice stance, and the chassis is the same as a Sparco/whatnot.
B00ZI1NK26|5|Very nice product, packing, and good shipping<br />So far very happy with purchase.
B005H7DRQA|5|Cheap and effective I'm happy. It does a great job on my leather
B00VLEX16O|3|well just got hem in yesterday . they look good test fit roller rockers and stud grilde on head an then went to put valve cover on . Want fit with stud gridle on . took grdl off with just rockers on fits fine . so the problem is the baffle in the valve cover . guess I will have to remove it . But they say these valve covers WILL FIT with roller rockers and STUD grdle well I see that's happing .not to good for a company to post false statements just starting out . wont be buying anything else from you are your products
B000C3BB44|5|Perfect fit, seems to be working well.
B00ZZO0448|5|these are great for rv lighting!
B000QJJ4IO|4|If you're looking for sound and have anything smaller than a v8, this isn't what you're looking for. Good performance, but comes with annoying drone.
B001N729FS|5|Easy to place, easy to use disconnect, just turn a nob.
B00XQEIBW6|5|Loved it grips the fender just right ! Going to buy another for the other side !
B002IX4M42|5|Love this steering wheel cover!  It is a little tight to put on at first definitely recommend letting it get warm first, maybe by putting it in the sun for a bit before attempting to wrestle it on. But once it is on there it stays put and looks great!
B004W4OG0U|5|they looked great at first but there is a thin film that is on them and actually starts to peal off after about a year
B00NGSNY88|5|Great Quality!!
B00A2WYV92|5|Unit works just fine,even though plugs R small.
B0002Z9QO4|2|NOT WATERPROOF. NOT WATER-RESISTANT.<br /><br />This is just a soft pack to put some stuff on your roof. Don't expect to have dry things if you go through a small rain shower or even drizzle. Still, it provides some extra room.<br /><br />Invest in something waterproof. Really. Because it rains outside sometimes, you know.
B000CMIV52|5|This was one of the best investments I made. I did a lot of research on airbags for my truck prior to my purchase. Firestone has the best. It's not fancy, but it works perfect and is reliable. I tow a few different heavy trailers and these are saving my truck. Installation was easy. The instructions were clear. I was done in about an hour.
B00LNDLGWE|5|super easy too install much better then what I had.
B0009V1WS4|5|Turnaround time was outstanding. Everything went through as I expected. Very satisfied.
B00ZVUBZV2|4|These are a lot better than I thought they were going to be . The straps very strong and sturdy . The clip where all buckles go into seem to be good quality .they have a good weight to them .install was easy and straightforward hardware was provided . The only thing is I wish I the straps got a tad bit tighter then it would be perfect.
B00QNUO7FK|5|I used to have hard water spots all over my vehicle whenever I got done using an ordinary towel.  However, this towel really helps get rid of all the water spots that are leftover whenever I wash my car.  One towel is enough for me to absorb all the water left behind after a wash on a sport sedan. No scratches or streaking.
B0049EDJ6U|3|Nice Transmission Pan Gasket. It was the wrong one for my transmission (the ad said it would fit). Could not send it back when I realized it because the time to do so had expired.
B00BCH4ZJC|3|don't  press to Hard in the foam to clean, damage the foam
B003FPF22I|4|c
B002XVPT78|3|Order was quick, but I have a Nexus 6, top of holder little small.  But very close to what I needed.
B001JT5TQQ|2|I read the reviews and I too couldn't find a location in my wife's SUV that would allow free flotation for this to work properly. I tried every location imaginable in the vehicle and something always altered the reading on this device. It worked fine in my house on the dining room table but I already knew what direction my table was facing!
B00OST5TAU|5|Great value, work extremely well and are extremely bright. Was extremely easy to install and seem to be well manufactured. Just put them on the boat last week. Time will tell if they hold up against the elements. So far extremely satisfied.
B0016KA88C|5|3M stick on and very good finish. I've had this on my truck for a long time now and haven't had a single problem with it! I would suggest getting it if your contemplating it.
B000HSC06W|4|Good value and just what I needed.
B00HKE622E|3|Disappointed in the gasket quality. Oil cooler case gasket failed 1000 miles on front near water inlet causing oil to mix with antifreeze. No rational reason for the gasket to fail in this area gasket installed properly split. Flat surface, puzzled as to how the gasket could fail.<br /><br />All that being said. There customer service was very responsive and replaced my purchase without any additional questions.
B003VLBPJA|2|Hooks fall off consistently.
B00EO0583Q|5|Worked as advertised. I mounted this light to the grab rail above my windshield on my boat. It really lights up well.
B007OX6E3S|5|It adapted well.
B000C2Y3HW|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B00K890RBU|5|Arrived quickly and was easy to install into my Simon XT that was sending out &#34;low battery&#34; warnings.
B00Z8AHAPA|5|these lights are very powerful. You basically see everything at night real clear.
B00D9C2CDO|4|No comments
B00W8DBZQU|5|Got these perfect fitting mats sooner than expected!
B00SLKWNO2|3|box was mangled on delivery. Parts missing. great customer service with the problem. got back more parts than were lost. However, parts were mislabeled, screws that attach running board to the body (which required drilling on my rig) were flimsy sheet rock, like screws, (had to get better). After installation they looked great, seemed sturdy, but were a little too flexible. When you step on them, and I am not a big guy, they flex a bit. overall a good deal, work for me.
B00CFMF7GI|5|Fits EXTREMELY well. I use WeatherTech products in the interior, wanted to save a little cash with this, I am very pleased, now I regret not buying for the interior.
B000E28C7M|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B0007Y4P9G|4|I have a 2013 Thor Hurricane 29X and this is the replacement lens for the side markers. It is a nice looking amber lens, but I have a problem with them cracking around the edges where I snap them on. I have to keep replacing them about every 6 months. I am full-timer and traveling constantly. They do not hold up to road vibration.
B004HCM9H4|4|Applied on new Buick Encore (2015) on a very hot florida sun, went on easy, and after a short time, it was wiped off just as easy.  Happy with results,  do not over baby my car with prep work as such, so thus far I'm happy with the results.  Beads up when it rains (Very often) and will reapply a few months down the road.
B000AM8B1I|5|Works Great, after cleaning my boat vinyl I applied Nu Vinyl Protectant and my 15 year old vinyl looks like new
B00BRL6RLW|5|Perfect
B004AH56KI|1|Died after a cpl years of light use.
B0087ZTEBG|5|Used this for my automatic chicken door and it worked great
B00D9C2CDO|4|Very nice cargo bag. I chose a bag over plastic trunk so it would be easier to store. Just got back from vacation and drove about 2700 miles and hit numerous very heavy thunderstorms. The luggage inside did not get a drop of water on it which were all soft bags with clothes mainly. You kinda have to figure out how to secure it well but once you do, there is no wind noise and it will not move at all on the roof. I say its a great product for the price and you can fold it up and put it away when you are finished with it.
B0041Q69CM|5|I love these grips and they are really easy to install. These are made very well.
B0047MAPFM|3|It works well, I do have a little trouble with the auto up down feature on the drivers window. Many times it can't be stopped, this was described in other reviews. Also, it works with the drivers side window even when the ignition is completely off, unlike the original switch.
B000C9UJL4|5|Easy to install when you know what you're doing. Works great, it's all I ever use on my truck.
B008074R4A|2|Don't waste your money.  Portion about replacing brake pads on front brakes is incorrect and leads you down a very costly road to repair.  The front caliper requires a tool (not mentioned in the manual to replace the pads.  Now my bike is down while I wait for the tool I needed that was not mentioned.  By the way the Suzuki S50 is junk.
B004JY6AVQ|5|Great product
B0032J1KAK|2|Not much difference in what I can see with my regular mirror. The mirror fell out of the frame with a few days of being installed and the view is a little wavy
B006TMMT9S|5|Fit perfect and looks great. Well priced replacement.
B00NFYMY20|5|classy.
B00OJ9N014|5|We used it on our 600 mile beach trip.  It faced substantial rain for about 50 miles.  Our stuff was bone dry when we unpacked.  It held our 3 suitcases, 2 duffel bags, EZ-UP tent and 2 beach chairs with room for more.  Secured it to a 2006 Honda Odyssey with OEM roof rails using the straps provided.  I added two extra ratchet straps over the top but I probably didn't need to.  It held fine with no noticeable wind noise. I also used a moving pad underneath. My fuel mileage dropped some (about 50 miles less per tank) but you should expect some loss with any roof carrier. Overall very impressed!
B004XXRLDO|5|I bought the red one, as it was cheapest.  The top is one piece of molded plastic, with two pockets to hold pencils, a small to medium sized remote control, etc.  It is sturdy, lightweight and just seems like the right size for working while in bed on in a comfortable chair.  I think the molded pockets really make this work well.  Also, the shape of the pockets is good for adding a clip light.
B002OW6WYU|2|The N841 that came with my motorhome failed to maintain a constant temperature of 40 F degrees or less.  After replacing virtually every part that could be replaced without the problem being remedied, I decided to purchase a brand new N841 exactly 14 months ago.  The replacement refrigerator has been working well until, suddenly, the lower door hinge snapped off.  I found that the upper and lower door hinges are made of plastic, and that the only remedy is to replace the entire door.  I called Norcold and explained that the fridge, although 14 months old, had been used for only 3 months given that my wife and I are not full-timers.  That made no difference to Norcold.  Their warranty period is 12 months and they refused to honor it for any failures beyond that timeframe --- even when the fault is obviously due to faulty materials of their own manufacture.  I wrote to the CEO of Norcold and Thetford, but have heard nothing back from him.  Their claim, &#34;Built to handle the demands and rigors of the road&#34; is an out-and-out falsehood.  I would never purchase another Norcold product.  It is shameful to charge $1100 to $1600 for a product that is so poorly constructed.
B000IYBEQC|5|These spark plug wires worked great in my 2001 Toyota Camry LE.
B00GUGYUTU|1|Received part and installed past 30 day limit. The cylinder leaked after installation as it is defective, now what? The return policy doesn't seem very fair.
B00PNUIKDG|4|Easy replacement for Ford's poor excuse for an inside door release. Nice price.
B00CXB84N4|5|Excellent buy! Did EXACTLY what it was suppose to do if in need of a gas burning fire pit. Burned warm and bright. Easily stored and packed for travel. Was asked about and recommends to  serveral people at our campsite  Would recommend the adapter for the bigger propane tank.
B00R4S5C6S|5|Fitted very well, and so far, so good
B00NBN1C78|4|An interesting way to add tire changing capabilities to a trailer, RV, or other vehicle.<br /><br />The jack is my favorite kind of scissor lift, and seems quite well made. Thought a bit small than the Torin Big Red jack I have (and use at the gun range - more on that later), it does seem to be solid and capable. I haven't tested its lift limits, but the mechanism is smooth and moves well without a lot of slip or play. This jack is similar to the standard equipment jack which came with my Toyota. You would of course, wan to make sure the safety rating for lift weight will work for your intended vehicle. The one weak spot in the jack is the two part handle, which connects with a very flimsy and loose keyhole kind of arrangement, with no locking or clamping mechanism at all. It will be very easy to have that fall apart while trying to use it.<br /><br />The container is made from a single sheet of metal, roughly 1/10 of an inch thick, welded dwon the middle of the top where the brackects attach, with one end wleded shut. It is about 4 inches square and 18 inches long, not including the attachment brackets and the tabs to secure the open end, all of which are welded on. The securing tabs add another 1.5 inches to the length. The attachment brackets add another 1.5 inches or so to the height, and are nearly 6 inches wide, extending past the square case on both sides. The slide-in piece to secure the open end of the tube is about .2 of an inch thick, 6.5 inches long, with a 2.5 inch length on the part bent 90 degrees. (Sorry I don't know my metal gauges - not that much of a machinist.) It seems quite sturdy, and I believe it would work well in the proper location on the outside of a vehicle.<br /><br />The open end can be secured with a padlock or other similar arrangement to maintain a reasonable amount of security. There is also a rubbery end cap which is pretty thick and should seal it from the weather, road debris, etc. The mounting hardware is stout and Ihave no doubt of it holding up to hard use - no worries there.<br /><br />The folding 4-way tire iron seems a bit flimsy to me, with no way to actually lock the folding arms in place - just a loose collar which slides over them to kind of hold them straight. This is not much concern to me, as I gave up this kind of tire iron for breaker bars a long time ago - much easier to use, especially when your favorite tire shop has power-wrenched those poor lug nuts on hard enough to simulate a weld. (I once had to change a tire out in the boonies under these conditions, and the 4-way iron was just about worthless against their power-cranked lug nuts. I had to get something to extend one banch for leverage, and it was not a safe or happy situation. I got a breaker bar and socket the next day and have never looked back.) Of course, if you need the different sizes of wrench end offered by the 4 way, then by all means be happy. It would be better than nothing.<br /><br />All that said, I think on balance it is a good setup, and one which I think many people will find useful for its intended purpose.<br /><br />Now back to my favorite use for these kinds of jacks - adjustable bench rests for guns and optics. A jack like this makes an excellent improvised adjustable gun (or binocular or scope) stand/benchrest, either at the range or in the wild. This one has that little movable u-channel on top, which lends itself to any number of arrangments for adding hardware for a soft or hard rest. The scissor screw lets you adjust it in height for just about anyone. I use my Big Red jack for this, with a Primos Hunting bag attached on the upper arms with the bag's integral hook and loop straps. I am looking for a way to attach a V-yoke to see if I like that better than the bag, and the top on this jack will make it easier than the Big Red. Since it is also smaller than the Big Red, it will be easier to carry and use.<br /><br />Not that this will be a use many people will need, but it does make for a nice bench rest for not much money, especially if the jack already needs to be there for its intended purpose. The V-yokes run under $10, and  asmall piece of wood and the proper bolt, and you are in business.<br /><br />I would probably not get this just for the jack, but if you needed or wanted a mountable system like this, I would certainly not hesitate to consider it. Not perfect, but pretty good.
B000RFSARI|4|Great price and fast shipping
B00ARJSGLY|5|Good quality hoes
B00BITHRJY|4|a/c works 10 times better....I neglected to remember to change old ones...blows like crazy now....don't wait like I did...
B00HNP91VO|5|Had installed on my atv, works great from being covered solid in mud, to being underwater, to using it to push people out of the mud with my wheeler!
B00T74VX24|5|worked good, used it on vacation to charge phones and electronics
B00IN4MFH6|5|Did the job and worked great.
B000IYSIUC|5|Fan fit perfectly.
B001E3PAF2|2|Not of high quality, I bought 2 and one quit working within an hour.
B00W77T0J6|3|Looks like carbon fiber but doesn't stand up to heat well, the glue gets weak after being in warmer temps. I did my interior pieces and its starting to peel after about a week or so. Still a good product for the money though, I would purchase again for other applications.
B00537FBIG|4|Not as simple as just bolt the thing on, but once you drop your bumper and exhaust that sucker isn't going anywhere
B005SR2GK2|1|Most definitely does not effing fit my 04 A4!
B001CYG6XS|4|Performing as advertised.  Set up was pretty easy.  Mounting was easy.  Be sure to follow set up instructions.
B000NU59ZI|5|good
B002MQCY7C|4|worked well
B00DOS0KC8|5|Not much I can say except this product works perfectly as a lubricant for the nanoskin autoscrub.  It is also very economical because the bottle is a concentrated solution which you have to mix with water.  Normally I go through an entire bottle of quick detailer when claying a car.  This bottle, on the other hand, will last several clay sessions.<br /><br />I haven't used it as a quick detailer yet, but based on the way my car feels after wiping it down while claying, I have very little doubt that it will work very well.
B00B5ZYY38|3|Screws do not fit machined holes for stock 2000 4Runner rear license plate mounting.
B003UM7B98|5|Awesome jack! Easy assembly and works great!
B00BV4D97K|4|I bought to clean the intake/valves on my Camaro after reading horror stories about PCV blowby from not running a catch can.  Foams and works well.  Intake was pretty clean, so I didn't notice much of a difference afterwards.
B00BB6LN9O|5|very nice.
B004HCM9H4|1|The product streaks when you try and and buff it off.  I've read some of the tricks written here, but to be quite frank, a non-boutique mainstreak wax like Meguiar's shouldn't require any special application and removal procedures other than applying thin coats and removing with a high quality MF towel.  We're not talking about Klasse AIO/SG or Zaino or any of the specialty boutique products you find in Autogeek or Autopia... this is Meguiar's, and the product should apply nicely (it does) and removal should be a breeze (it's not, it smears).  I used Ultimate Polish before applying (which, BTW, is a fantastic product) which left a very nice substrate to apply Ultimate Wax.  I used a porter cable DA polisher with a Lake Country finishing pad to apply whisper thin coats.  As per the instructions on the bottle, I waited 5 mins for the wax to dry and tried to remove...but the product smeared.  So I decided to wait another 15 mins, but the product continued to smear.  I'm going to return this product and go back to my all-time favorite product line when it comes to waxes (Mothers).  My guess is this smearing quality is a by-product of Meguiar's attempts to make this product sun-friendly (i.e., OK to use under the sun).  In doing so, they essentially turned what could have been an excellent product into something that isn't very use-friendly.
B000CAINEI|4|I feel great because I saw a lot of people are using it then I said to myself I am gonna try out.  The only thing I feel not all right is when I am not using it like to fold back is a bit occupying some spaces to put it, that's all.
B00LOZQPY0|5|Arrived on time and was exactly what I expected and ordered. Thank you!
B00062YWMO|1|junk
B00H26O1PA|5|Love this rhinestone keychain. Super cute and mich cheaper priced then buying from the dealership.
B008ND40AW|5|It defiantly works, and for a part that strips out a lot on a vehicle I think the price is worth it
B0024ECBCA|3|I bought this from Amazon a little over a year ago and it recently needed to be replaced. The diaphragm on the inside failed and some of the gas was coming out weakly from the 'closed' side. The guys who installed the replacement said that sometimes they just fail. So, lesson learned.
B004CMMFK0|5|Love this stuff
B008YGI2HA|5|JUST WHAT I NEEDED
B009VQK8OW|3|great
B000UP7N8M|5|just installed- worked
B003PIQNHS|5|Awesome
B002R4U72I|5|I used one package of 2 inch x 50 foot roll Titanium DEI to wrap the headers on my 2004 BMW R1150R . I had 20 foot left over.  I measured the lengths I removed of some other fiberglass wrap, some real junk stuff, that only lasted a couple of weeks, cheap stuff I  purchased from that online auction place that starts with E- , I'd bought the black but it started turning white a short time later, literally a couple of weeks. I cut one 11 foot piece for each header side & a 9 foot for the center. I read online to start at the rear & wrap toward the cylinder, which I tried at first on one side, but then removed, sacrificing two of my stainless zip ties in the attempt . I then wrapped both sides one side at a time front to back or cylinder to cat, which I think looks nicer.  Cutting the separate lengths is going to make your install A LOT easier because your not going to be passing the whole roll between the motor & header each time around. (Although removing headers from bike & wrapping would eliminate that too)  I did buy my zip ties at great price off the E- auction place. The titanium wrap looks real good. Easy to install with 1/4-1/2 inch overlay. Not itchy like the glass stuff. Although I did wear the thin rubber gloves. It smoked  a little bit after my 11 mile ride to work but then quit on my return ride. I'll see if I can add a picture at a later date. DEI Titanium is the best looking & easiest to install. You'll be glad you got it.
B00YC6JGSU|5|[[VIDEOID:40beaee23dbe1b69db7ff49f2bf859f7]]These lights are solidly built and were very easy to install on our 1998 Jeep Wrangler (TJ), literally almost as easy as plug 'n play.<br /><br />The lights are brilliant and are made for off-road use. Low beams light up a football field, and high beams warm you up from a block away. The high/low beam operation is flawless.<br /><br />Removing the old light and putting on this new one requires a T-15 size Torx head screwdriver. The process is not difficult, though an extra set of hands is nice when it comes to removing the power cord from the old light, and when you need someone to hold the new light in position so you can get those first couple screws back in the retaining ring.  The general process is:<br /><br />* Remove chrome bezel (3 screws)<br />* Remove steel retaining ring (4 screws)<br />* Pull out and disconnect old light<br />* Connect new light and place in housing<br />* Put retaining ring back on<br />* Put chrome bezel back on<br /><br />We found that these lights pointed higher than the OEM lights we removed, and so we used the T-15 Torx screwdriver to adjust the vertical alignment of the lights too. The two adjustment screws can be seen between the headlight and the chrome bezel, and the bezel has recessed areas that give you room to stick the Torx screwdriver in and reach the screws.<br /><br />You really need to move both screws to make things happen the way you desire; turning a screw to the right makes the light move towards the screw; the higher screw controls up & down, while the lower screw controls left & right.<br /><br />As mentioned, these light are solidly built and are IP67 rated -- the \\"6\\" means that they are absolutely dust tight, while the \\"7\\" means that they can withstand complete immersion up to 1 meter (3 feet) and that they can withstand this for at least 30 minutes.<br /><br />After the install we took a video for you to view. Total install time... maybe 10 minutes per light... but we (mostly my teenage son) were taking our time. These are outstanding off-road lights and we would recommend them to anyone looking for lights like this.<br /><br />The manufacturer's retail materials note that the lights are covered by a 1 year warranty, so if an issue occurs within that period I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.<br /><br />If you are looking for off-road lights of this size, style, price and ruggedness, for use similar to what I have described above, then my son and I would highly recommend giving these lights from Autofeel a try based on our experience with them.<br /><br />Very recommended<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from a seller without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it this weekend.

B00HDMEUCW|5|Great to protect the seats after leaving the gym when we are all sweaty. Washes well in the wash machine easy on/off on the car seat.
B000F5LJ1E|5|A little expensive for what it is but it does work great!!!
B000C9ISTO|5|Fit a 99 gmc Sierra ext cab 5.3 with towing package. Has hookups for transmission cooler lines only. No hookups for engine oil cooler. Check your vehicle before ordering.  This is a 34 inch radiator. If you have a 28 inch, this is a direct bolt in swap/upgrade. There are pre existing holes for both radiator sizes.<br /><br />Came with new transmission line quick connect fittings. Didn't have to unscrew them. Simply pop the clips out of the old radiator and remove lines, clean the lines and Barb area, and slide them into the new radiator...slides right into the clips.<br /><br />I do have to say, pretty mad at ups or the distribution warehouse... It had a foot print from a boot on side of box. But only minimal affect on cooling fins luckily. I wasn't gonna complain about it because most radiators you get from the parts store have pre existing damage too. You can't win. Too easy to smush the fins on any radiator.
B00BGC0MDQ|5|Loved it
B00LXEKE76|5|Love the glasses
B0027AKQUK|5|Fits like a glove, works fine.
B0046NPOGC|5|Perfect fit what else can I say. Used on a 97 Dodge ram 1500 club cab 5.9.
B008H3YIWS|5|perfect
B00BFI0LNC|5|Nice decal! Great size and looks sharp on my van window
B000U0Z2L2|5|Works great I have had no problems out of they's
B001EAQTRI|5|Works great, have been using it for 3 years. Blocks high pitched ground loop noise that occurs when I connect any phone or device to my 2008 Toyota Prius while simultaneously powering it by the car's electrical system. The first unit I received was defective but the seller immediately replaced it without requiring a return.
B00063Z0TW|5|Although it cannot remove my tiny dents, it still solve other middle dents. Good product!
B00RV83UUG|1|Three of my LEDs does not work. Refuse to reply for refund or replacement.
B006X8AR4M|5|Looks good, fits 1999 tacoma 2wd 2.4
B00ABYVT64|5|I had to cut it to so that it didnt bend as you see in the pictures posted here. These are the same bottles they use on their 16 oz products so it matches my other CG things! I wish there was a way to see how much youre putting in it so that you can dilute correctly, but I just use a ruler.
B00UO9OAGC|5|Work out great!
B007M5QH5S|5|The first one I ordered was for the wrong model of truck. My bad. It was piece of cake to return it and I got the right one very quickly. It was easy to install and worked great. Now I don't have my trailer wiring harness from the gooseneck hanging over the tailgate.
B00TOWQNEC|5|eveyone is asking where i bought it...
B00ML7DIJA|5|Loved them the minute I put Reverse on my 2004 Ford Focus! They light up the entire rear of my driveway as if I had projector foglamps behind my car! Great Job Guys & looking forward to doing buisness again!
B00A9IIC12|5|Good product
B000P4U0F6|2|Not an exact match to original ; but it works.
B00AIFZ3ZY|5|This is by far the most flexible wire i have ever seen and heavy too i love it can't recommend this stuff enough.  I was also very happy to find upon measuring the wire it measured 10'8&#34;
B00DIIL6D6|1|This thing is pretty cheaply made. The plastic see through part isn't flat to the device so it sticks out & is hard for my daughter to watch thru without creative rigging due to glare. The middle pocket is very shallow & basically useless. And, the bottom just hangs down, but bothers my daughter. It would be nice if it attached to the seat somehow at the bottom. I gave it 1 star bc it's minimally functional. I'm buying a better made one & throwing this crap out!
B000CSKB6I|4|Good quality, but does not fit my suburban.
B0053ZAIYU|3|Red one constantly dies. I've changed the battery 3 times and within 48 hours of changing it dies. Not sure what's wrong with it. Guess you get what you pay for. White one works fine but the red one is more important to me.
B007HQ6E6E|5|Was a perfect fit
B00UI0QMHC|5|Made real nice, bolt alignment perfect. If you going to use the on aftermarket heads these bolts are metric you'll need new bolts.I installed them on a Datsun 240 Z with a sbc. so you Datsun guys they fit with no problem. Who want's block huggers?
B00W8CE98C|4|The lights are great. Love the way they give my car a fresh look. They work well and fit perfectly but I have a small issue with these. I would give it 5 stars if the holes for the bulbs were not as tight...I had to turn it with force and push the bulb sockets in to get them to sit properly other I've they were not sitting. Over all great product and seem like a decent built product!
B00UM9UCE8|4|Nice filter at a great price, most people do not even know they have one of these.
B00VACDLZS|5|Excellent mats and cargo liner would recommend to any one with renagade.
B00INCHB8G|5|Myy bueno
B00B8Z5Q4G|5|quick on time delivery good price and good replacement for original fender
B00H3TI3D2|5|Good product, fast shipping
B00K2SLS7O|5|Fit perfect arrived when expected no issues
B000FJQSY8|5|Amazon thinks this is shoes... whatever.  *LOL*  This is a great blend of mink oil, neetsfoot oil, and lanolin.  Works great on dry leather !!!
B00KTHU1QM|4|When I purchased my 2003 Altima, only one key fob was provided.  The plastic piece finally broke off and I jumped on Amazon to see about replacements.  After pouring through reviews, I purchased this pair.  Received within two days and was very simple to set up.  I now have two fobs in great condition that both work great.  It seems the range is a little shorter than the original fob, but really pleased with the fobs and ease of set up.
B004YID58S|5|Looks great on my Tundra. Easy install.
B002OPPGKS|5|Added more response, great add on!
B004MDEV38|5|Took 2 people about 40 minutes to install. It looks great!
B0000AXDOY|5|We were a little nervous about buying this but we took the risk and it was so worth it!. It has worked perfectly!
B006IDFZMQ|5|This is awesome, only thing I'm kinda mad about is I didn't get the smoked ones. They are really bright and install wasn't bad at all took about an hour and bam perfect product will be buying smoked ones later
B00KY0ND7I|5|A good buy. Fits fine
B001C6JCCS|4|Just a Heads up.  This kit only includes the manifold and two studs.  No Gasket included. Dorman does have a stud kit, but your will have to buy the gasket from remflex or some other manufacturer.
B00026Z3EA|4|as advertised and expected
B00XAU62Q8|3|Not very bright except at night. Also the cable that is included it much to short and I had to cut and add more wire for them to reach my headlights.
B00HS5Y3M6|5|I bought these for my son's car to cover some scratches.  The went on easy and look great.  He's happy.
B001NZZMOA|5|VERY HAPPY !!
B00IPS4APU|1|Did not work as advertised, my crack looks just like before I applied the product. I would avoid this and just go to the professionals
B0002F69YO|1|The small adjustable memory level is almost impossible to set and once it is set any small vibrations will move it off the desired position. While installing I was never able to get it positioned to be level in the closed position and also to be level in the swing out position (for side to side leveling). There are simpler, less expensive products on the market.
B00BFDIQPM|5|Exact fit for 2003 Honda CRV driver's side door.  Was able to re-code the cylinder to fit the original key.
B001B9SL50|5|Excellent product
B00A9MZAJA|5|Exact fit for 2003 Honda CRV.  Fits and functions perfectly.
B00H1DOHTY|4|Great stuff but way too expensive for the amount you get. I researched and bought some Obenauf's Heavy Duty Leather Preservative.
B001ODAS68|5|National Oil Seal Co is top rated in their field for producing quality parts, if it says National you can be sure it's a great product
B00480BWA0|5|Came in handy with our propane fire pit.Easy to install and remove.
B00U9YZ89U|3|good product over all, as it should fit different cars it does not fit perfectly as it is a bit (about 1&#34;) on the socket , had to sew it together under the frame so it does not climb out. My son loves the look inside his 92' Stealth
B00UJS3NKW|5|good product
B009D04QX0|1|Well, for the price, I shouldn't have expected much. I read the reviews and thought that even though they weren't sturdy, they would at least clamp to my pedals for a while. Turns out, just to get them tight enough to stay put, I ended up screwing the screw all the way through the screw hole (see photo). So I got some screws with larger heads, and no matter how tight I made them, they would not stay straight on the pedals after driving for twenty minutes. Not even worth returning.
B003EOZH9S|3|I needed a budget-minded solution to achieve narrower and thinner fenders. These Smittybilts are a pretty good solution. My only issues are:<br /><br />1. The rear fenders should have been designed to follow the contour of the (cut/reused) inner wheel liners so that you avoid having these weird gaps. It is merely cosmetic, but a slight re-design of these fenders could make a positive difference (see pictures).<br /><br />2. The front fenders should accommodate the front side lights. I'm pretty sure you need it in most states (if not all) and I personally like the light for extra safety. So I had to do a goofy mount to make do for now. Ideally this product should have been designed to hold the light. For example, a little more metal and a hole to expose the light would have been perfect (see pictures).
B001DBBTO6|4|no issues.
B007J5H1CO|1|I do not recommend this item at all. I started with placing two in my car and did not notice a scent at all. I placed two more the following day, still cant tell they were added, and after adding two more for the third day I stopped. A total waste of money.<br />!
B003YK96VC|5|Install was quick and works well.  A second way (other than hitch) to get into bed of truck.  A little hard to find when stepping down with a load in your hands but suspect muscle memory will correct that in time.
B005KOZ25Y|5|Very easy to use, works great!
B00GXRG64I|5|the best microfiber towel I have found so far.
B000PGVZ30|5|Easy to use; works great!
B000VG9NXI|5|These are a lot more heavy duty than I expected.  The only bad thing is the holes in the mats are too large, so the turn tabs on your Beetle floor won't really hold them in place.  Yet they're so heavy, I don't think it will be an issue.  I think these will be nice when the snow starts to fly too.  Easy clean compared to the fabric ones. Plus they're super cute!
B0089UEOKA|4|everything fit well, but this downpipe sits low under the car. my car is at stock height but ever since ive installed this downpipe ive had to worry about it scraping. everything else has been great.
B00XMGADD8|1|It doesn't work for my car z350
B000C94E74|4|I bought this for my 1989 Toyota pickup due to it having the port for a downstream O2 sensor (CA required). But the port hole wasn't drilled out, that I had to do myself. Luckily I have a good size drill press and good set of bits. The posts on the port are longer than needed for this application so they easily get bent in shipment even though a good job was done wrapping it. As a result a nut would not tighten. I remedied the situation by adding another nut. But I'll never get that sensor off in one piece if required in the future. Be careful when ordering. I missed the part about this being for an extended cab. So my hacksaw got some use. I specified in Amazon the year, make, model, truck trim type and engine type but that didn't ensure selecting the right part. It would have been nice if dimensions for this part were specified in the picture. Later I realized they were down in the notes.  Like the other review I had to modify the muffler hangers. But wasn't too bad a deal. The item was delivered on time and overall this was a lot better than dealing with the local muffler shop.
B000BRJOW2|2|Very nice to look at, but in complete shreds by the time we reached our camp site?  Maybe OK if RV is stationary, but certainly not for open road!  travel!
B00KFOSO6I|5|🎶Jimmy Page🎸/Led Zeppelin Best Band Ever🎶
B00A8SWYNA|3|didn't realize how small it is, but if I do well I'll know next time....
B001B7TT1M|5|Awesome product and super easy to install.  I have it in my 2014 Ford Raptor.  I ended up getting one for each side and it's perfect and doesn't take away too much bed space.
B00ELHNM6C|5|Good solid oil and delivered right on my doorstep.  Packaged well and no leakage.
B00EIIRQS4|2|Cheap<br />Paint discolored in month
B008CE0W5Y|5|Works great, all there and easy to install!
B00D3QQUGG|5|We use these magnets every time my 17-year old gets behind the wheel. Other drivers are alerted that she is a student driver and are more careful and courteous around her. Really helps with her confidence. I would recommend this for every new driver out there.
B000NL3QBQ|5|perfect, easy to install.
B00CGTVESK|5|THIS IS NOT &#34;REAL&#34; LEATHER, THAT IS TO SAY ANIMAL SKIN, IT IS AN EXPANDED VINYL, WHICH IN MY OPINION IS MUCH BETTER - IT IS EASY TO CLEAN, IT WAS EASY TO PUT ON MY DODGE DAKOTA STEERING WHEEL (which is real leather).  ONCE IT IS OUT OF THE PACKAGING FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES, I WOULD CONSIDER IT &#34;ODOR-FREE&#34;.  DO NOT BUY THOSE STINKY WHEEL COVERS WITH BPA.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COVER.
B001AXGT7O|5|strong and well made
B00M3JTS5O|5|LOVE this light.  Although I must say that I was very disappointed when my packaged arrived and only one light was inside. I had been researching lights for hours and they all came with two. I didn't realize that this was not a set. That was my bad.  That being said, two of these on the back of my new Ram 1500 would be ridiculous for what I use it for.  I just wanted a spot light (I wired the RED and BLACK wires to a switch in the cab so I could turn the spot on separately, then I wired the BLUE wire (Flood light section of the light) to my reverse lights; tip, if you have a dodge ram with a tow package, the trailer connection has a wiring diagram right on the flap so you don't have to take your tail lights off to wire the reverse lights; second tip, the reverse light is the Orange and White wire in the center of the trailer harness) for working behind the truck and reverse lights that would allow me to see backing up, through my dark window tint.  This does both jobs perfectly.  It is brighter than I expected it would be.
B00JHK34RA|1|I returned this item.  One of lenses was out and I was able to place it back in but not confident it would stay.  Also, the description made it sound like the lights were fully adjustable.  I wanted to be able to turn them from side to side but they only move up and down.  It just wasn't what I wanted.
B00E3BQQ5K|1|Blinkers have blown 4 fuses and now I am changing my voltage regulator because it has now went out. I put them on a 1999 Yamaha Road Star 1600. Have not had any problems until I put the blinkers on my bike. Would not recommend.
B00M9NOTJ4|4|Looks great on the 48!!!!
B00GXPPJPC|4|My second D jacket. The first one is a summer jacket (forgot the name) and size 48.<br />The Laguna Evo (non-perforate) is about 1/2 size larger without the thermo-liner. With the liner, it is a good fit, but still not as good as the summer jacket.<br />The Shield G2 back protector in the summer jacket also fits in the Laguna Evo.<br />Overall, a very nice jacket for the price.
B000C5DZWI|5|Good it was great & did job thanks
B00JRHI1LM|5|Very surprised at the comfort. Love it.
B000630AII|5|Outstanding, durable, washing is easy !!  Big difference in performance but you MUST keep your MAF clean or else it's your peril. Use 89 octane also. This air filter does allow a small degree of particles into the intake due to high flow. DO NOT recommend driving in snowing salty roads.
B000J0IBKM|5|Amazing detail for such a small little figurine! Bought two, one for my bag, other as a collectible. Sesshomaru is one of my favorite characters.
B0091VFI6K|3|Perfect fit, but drivers rug didn't have brass clip around the hole. Therefore when I slip the rugs over the latch in carpet of my Honda the hole has ripped bc there's no brass piece there for protection.
B001IH8Q0A|4|Did it's job and saved our family camping trip. Delivered quickly as promise and loved the pricing!
B00F2L9X78|5|Great part
B00P2D41OQ|5|These look great! They are the perfect &#34;OEM replacement&#34; from Philips, an actual brand name. They aren't like the cheap LED bulbs you find elsewhere that are either too dim, too bright, or too blue. These don't scream &#34;aftermarket&#34; like those bulbs. They are the same brightness as the OEM bulbs, maybe a tiny bit brighter, but not by much. The only difference is they are pure white (5000K if anything). Not that gross yellow light, and not blue or anything like that. They look great aesthetically. Just be careful when installing them, polarity is important!
B000CO9YPG|5|does the job for lifting the F250
B006K8G5Y6|3|Hard to feed tape back, but overall measures tires correctly.
B004FGTOES|5|perfect
B009NUY4PU|5|No problems with install. Fit well. I'd recommend to others looking for something like this.
B000COB422|4|way too long for my application so so I had to cut off over 2 ft. Seems to work fine and quiet.
B004B68XGC|2|Nice package, but! It is rated at 150psi, but if a tire has around 115 psi and the compressor is fully charged it will not start.  The work around is to bleed some air out of the compressor so it starts then fill the tire  over the 115psi, in my case to 120 psi. The unit comes with a gauge but it is about 1.5 and 2 psi off (compaired to their Digital gauge and my tire monitor, both show the same).  Something you can easily adjust for, but you would think a company selling air products would have accurate gauges,
B00430BQ8I|4|Sprays nicely, very satisfied with the result.  Damaged on delivering causing it to spill out when first opened.
B0007LZI8G|4|c
B004UTD0RW|1|Painted started chipping off after a month.
B0097TWG7K|4|Bright light, holds a full charge a long time. very happy.
B00LNG6C3Y|1|The description stated the floor matts would fit my 2005 Prius, they do not. I now have to return them.
B000C55SZK|5|good
B00R6R6E78|3|Not what I expected but it does work
B001OMRF7Y|1|Was not what was shown in picture Of sale What I got was just one back piece no proof no cover
B001CO18MW|5|Quality built item with good welds.<br /><br />Nice finish.<br /><br />Remember, to get the most out of an intake it is recommended to get a tune.  Sure you can run without, but you run the risk of leaning out your air fuel ratio.  Besides, the tune will make sure you are making the most power you can while making sure your parameters are good.
B000IG5PVU|5|A most for my cars, especially hitting two deers 6 months apart.
B0028JQYSS|4|Great to use for emergency
B008BE04C6|5|The perfect repair for my burned out light.
B00KBA27KA|5|Worked as it should.
B004500M8G|1|DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!! I had a few drips every week of radiator fluid. I thought it might be old gaskets so this would do the trick. I followed all the instructions.<br />Next day when I turned the car on I had a positive channel of radiator fluid pouring out of the front of my engine block. We're talking major damage somewhere. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!<br />Excuse me while I now go and fix my engine.
B00PT18QAQ|5|I lost a similar type gauge from a different company that was about 20 years old and was similar size.  So in my quest to replace I was really picky and hesitant but could not put it off any longer so I turned to Amaxon.  So great to find a quality AMERICAN made product that is easy to use, hold and read.  The longer stem is so much easier than my old one with nice grip to prevent slippage.  Instead of having to be an inch away and would lose the reading, this one keeps the reading until you press on the release!  so now I can stand up and carry it into a lighted area at night.  Now I wish that I lost my old one  sooner!!!!
