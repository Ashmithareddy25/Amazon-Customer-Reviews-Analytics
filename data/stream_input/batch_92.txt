B00004TT9X|5.0|This single is great for any Britney fan! It includes the song &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;, an Instrumental version of the song, a remix of &quot;From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart&quot;, and a non-American  track, &quot;Deep In My Heart&quot;. My favorite song is the instrumental  version of &quot;Oops&quot;. If you arn't really a huge fan of Britney,  then you might want to just buy the album but if you are a fan, this single  is for you. Also the cover is worth the money alone! :-)
B00002DCXM|4.0|I think its a good CD but it is a little more soft than the last ones exept Chamaleon, but you should buy it if you like a good vocal like Michael Kiske! The bonus track is good but not a Helloween style music!
B00000JJQK|5.0|The hallmark pop album of all time. If you dont own it buy it. Mono, or stereo, its just too great to be without. A must have.
6305075468|5.0|I first saw this film at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor Michigan.  It was a special presentation with a live symphony playing the movies score.    I was afraid that I would never be able to experience Nosferatu like that  again.  Boy was I wrong, this DVD has great sound.  The film itself is  crisp for its age.  It is an overall great buy.  The commentary track is a  bit dry and sound like a freshmen lecture of German expressionist films, so  don't listen to that, just watch the movie and enjoy! <br />PS:How come no  one ever mentions that Mr. Burns for the Simpsons is modeled after  Nosferatu?   Just a little side fact.
B00004T37H|5.0|...This film could rest on just that achievement alone, with animation so sophisticated that it almost puts live action to shame. Set in feudal  Japan, it is the story of an orphan princess raised by a giant wolf and her  cubs in an achingly beautiful and enchanted forest where the  animals are  both giants and gods.  A young prince  from a far away clan is searching  for the Night- walker - a great mystical spirit which rules  the forest -  to seek help for a secret and horrible wound.  There is also the warrior  woman (essentially a queen) who rules a city of emancipated women who work  a mining forge which is slowly destroying the forest.  The plot, though  complicated, is easy to follow...and the characters are complex - enough  so, that we find ourselves understanding and liking people who would  ordinarily be perceived as villains....and there is no pat, pretty little  ending either.  While this reviewer has briefly described the three most  important characters and has only hinted at the plot, the biggest mistake  one could make upon reading this review is to think that this is like  anything they've ever seen before.  This film is Oscar material.
0156465116|5.0|It's a book that reminds us where we come from.  It shows us how to remain creative, thinking human beings--and how to avoid turning into calculating zombie/machines. It keeps us on track in a world riddled with networks of  misleading crossroads.  But, beware, stick to the original translation.   The new translation is, in my opinion, a mistake: if something works, it  needs no fixing!
B000002MY3|4.0|This is a CD is some what a instant classic. From the moment you put this CD you begin to take a journey where Alanis is leading you is unknown at the begining but it all becomes clear in the end.<br />The CD deals with the  total human experience, it takes you thorugh need, love, hope, fear &amp;  fogivness, and the lyrics are amazing. <br />The lyrics are so thought  provoking, they make you take stock of your lifem where its been, where is  it now, and where is it going. (At least it did for me!) <br />Musically as  well alanis is also strong although the producer must get some credit it  to.<br />This album is what a album should do, its almost life changing, the  way it makes you think, what u done, before how you want to change. <br />If  only more albums were made in this spirit!

B00003Q43A|4.0|So give us all a break!  To all the self-proclaimed elitist snobs. Lets try to remember that is the reason why movies like Independence Day are made, to escape from our dower everyday lives and thats why we flock to see  them. Yes, the United States is made to look like the world savior, but how  far is that really from the truth? Arent we called upon all the time to  save the world from itself? If the plot of this movie were to really happen  the united nations would roll over and beg for us to save them! Yes it is a  feel good about being American movie and so it should be we were riding the  high from our victory in the Persian Gulf and a resurgence of patriotism  and this movie capitolized on this in spades it was meant to make you want  to stand up and sing &quot;proud to be an American&quot; at the end of the  movie. I think that the other nations peoples may just see this for what it  is and may make them get the message that its better to join us than fight  us anymore. And wasnt anyone watching the part of the movie were it said  that the president was an ex-fighter pilot Gulf War hero, so with pilots at  a shortage then wouldnt Pullman get in the cockpit once again? After all  once a fighter jock always a fighter jock! And though it didnt explain it  the more I let go of my cinisism of the Smith finding his girlfriend scene,  it led me to think well she did go to El Toro marine air station and maybe  he checked elsewhere and figured maybe she went there in such an emergency,  my wife would go to our air base where I am stationed in such a situation  and what military spouse would not? All in all its a decent movie with some  good humour and great special effects and the video transfer onto digital  is superbly done, the sound in 5.1 will give a great workout to all our  expensive surround systems and isnt that what they are bought for. Plus  there are some great extras I just wish more releases had this much stuff  on them, maybe someday hollywood will start to make more movies that  completly utilize the advantages of DVD, like multi camera angles and such.  Go on and buy this you wont be dissapointed and if you are well maybe you  should stick with documentaries and nature specials.
B00004U30D|5.0|This movie takes us on a giant trip to the mind of Lester Burnham a man  whose life was a complete mess his wife didn't love him his daughter almost  hated him and he fell in love with his daughter's friend. This  extraordinarily directed film shows everything around Lester in the last  stage of his life were all the problems come together until he explodes(  not literally) and becomes irresponsible,quits his job, drugs himself with  his neighbor etc. This film also has really weird and great characters like  the young neighbor who besides dealing drugs, filmed everything around him,  his wife played by Annette Bening who is a perfect woman has everything in  order and is kind of neurotic, two of his neighbors were gay and his other  neighbor hated gays causing troubles at the end of the movie.But what I  truly love about this movie is that at the end after showing us the many  beauties in this world Lester shows his family and his surroundings were  really far from being American Beauty. So rent it ,buy it whatever but  don't or at least try not to miss this great film which by the way got many  many awards which it deserved.
0517122707|5.0|This is an amusing social commentary. The main character, Ignatius Jefferson Reilly, is a born loser. He is convinced that humanity was better off during the Middle Ages. Toole could not have chosen a more appropriate  sletting for this novel: the seedy and licentious city of New Orleans.  Reilly is humorous (I actually laughed out loud) not because he is fat and  lazy, but rather he is acutely accurate, albeit morose in his judgement of  human nature and personal character. He is also extrordinarily articulate.  I hope they never try to make a movie out of this book because the  Hollywood establishment would surely spoil it. Besides, Reilly would be  furious. Highly recommended as an American classic.
B000002I6T|5.0|Few artists generate such \\"love:hate\\" press as David Crosby - reactions based as much on his extreme personality &amp; lifestyle as his often erratic musical output. But... the truth is that, in his early work at least,  he was intimately involved in a number of records that pushed the  boundaries of \\"folk-pop\\" into totally new areas.<br />From early 1966 to late  1967 his hand is overtly there as writer or co-writer throughout a series  of highly innovative Byrds tracks including: \\"Eight Miles High\\" &amp; \\"I  See You\\" (from \\"Fifth Dimension\\"); \\"Why\\", \\"Renaissance Fair\\", \\"Everybody's  Been Burned\\", \\"Lady Friend\\" &amp; \\"It Happens Each Day\\" (from the  remastered version of \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\"); and, \\"Draft Morning\\",  \\"Tribal Gathering\\", \\"Dolphin's Smile\\" &amp; \\"Triad\\" (from the remastered  version of \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\"). Between 1968 and 1969 he  recorded two further beautifully atmospheric minor key ballads with Crosby,  Stills &amp; Nash - \\"Guinnevere\\" &amp; \\"The Lee Shore\\" (from \\"Crosby,  Stills &amp; Nash\\" and \\"Carry On\\") - and, with \\"If I Could Only Remember My  Name\\", released in 1971, he completed a five year tour-de-force of  creativity with a further series of superbly arranged and delivered songs  including: \\"Tamalpais High\\", \\"Laughing\\", \\"Traction In The Rain\\", \\"Song With  No Words\\" &amp; \\"Orleans\\".<br />Put that lot together (as someone really  should) and you have a full CD's worth of highly distinctive music that  fully justifies a major reputation. In the meantime the curious should  start with \\"If I Could Only Remember My Name\\": the best, most satisfyingly  complete example of why David Crosby's early career deserves serious  attention.
B00004TEWP|5.0|Britney Spears has a certain music style that I have loved from day one.  I purchased her first album and was impressed.  When her second one was released I wasn't sceptical - but assumed it would be difficult to beat her  first one.  Yes it did!  I purchased the import version with the 3 extra  tracks, and EVERY single track was amazing!  It was like she new my  favourite songs and each one was it.  I would definitely say that any  Britney fans out there spend the little extra cash for the extra tracks,  because it is so worth it.  The album has many styles which complement each  other.  There is the required dose of *n sync (who I subsequently love too)  and even a little destiny's child/tlc influence on track 3!
B00000K31V|2.0|Normally, i would not go to a movie like this, but by accident we were confronted with it. While technically there is some beauty, even probably new visual content to it, the story was not understandable to me. The mood  in it was like a bad dream, fear and desperation reigned. By the end of the  movie, i wanted to immediately forget about this experience. Depression is  not a particularly creative expression. By flashing back, i only could feel  sorry for the wasted talent of the persons involved with production and  execution, and the finances withhold for more significant and enlightening  projects.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This artist must be some kind of genius!  He has taken fabulous blues/gospel sound bytes and married them to incredible techno tracks.  I was taken over by this album...it owns me, is in my head all the time.  All  it took was hearing two songs on a local radio station  &quot;Porcelain&quot; and &quot;Natural Blues&quot; to know I had to hear  more, but I was not prepared for how much more I got on &quot;Play&quot;!   Buy this one if you want music that you will never tire of, will marvel  over for years to come.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|I like this CD.  She's a really good latin singer, and a great latin dancer.  I think it is wonderful that she was raised somewhere in a place like the, Bronx, NY and she is so talented.  This shows that if you try  hard enough, you can achieve your goals.  Jennifer is a real great  role-model.  This CD is wonderful. I just love it! If you don't have it,  please try to buy it.  It's a really nice song.  It has some real good  party songs like, &quot;Waiting For Tonight,&quot; and real sweet songs  like, &quot;No Ma Ames,&quot; f/ Marc A.
B000002UEB|5.0|It never fails to amaze me that one of the lamer metal bands of the 80's managed to produce one of the top 10 metal albums of that decade.  Until Operation Mindcrime this band was just like most other metal bands of the  time that didn't quite make it - lots of leather and makeup, but not much  else.  This CD has it all, from excellent production values to killer songs  that tell a story.  This is metal's answer to Pink Floyd's &quot;The  Wall&quot;.  Highly recommended.
0451191153|1.0|THE FOUNTAINHEAD came highly recommended by a like-thinking libertarian friend of mine who believed I would be receptive to Ayn Rand's philosophical ideals of personal freedom and free market ideals.  Upon  reading Rand's epic, I was struck by its similarities to John Milton's  PARADISE LOST.  Like Milton, Rand has curiously allowed the novel's  supposed villain, Ellsworth Toohey, to be the most fascinating character in  the book.<br />Unlike Milton's epic poem, however, Rand's novel has virtually  no literary value whatsoever.  The novel's value arises merely from the  odious fact that her cult of devotees insist this trash is a classic of  world literature and philosophy. As a philosopher, Ayn Rand is no novelist.   And as a novelist, Ayn Rand is no philosopher. <br />There is absolutely no  believable dialogue or action in this novel -- the weak plot functions  merely as a tool for philosophical harangues to spill out of the mouths of  completely uninteresting characters.  I know the defenders of THE  FOUNTAINHEAD say that Rand purposefully created an ideal character in  Howard Roark.  Ideal?  Perhaps.  Unsurpassingly dull, without a doubt.  Howard Roark is the most wooden, one dimensional literary character that I  have ever encountered;  he exists solely on the paper on which he is  printed.  <br />The love scenes between Howard Roark and Dominique Francon are  likewise laughable. Rand's idea of passion must be akin to a neanderthal  clubbing his betrothed over the head and dragging her back to the cave. How  ironic that Rand completely subverts her Objectivist philosophy by  pandering to the lowest common denominator.   <br />Defenders of Rand say that  THE FOUNTAINHEAD is actually the lessor of Rand's philosophical treatises,  and that to fully appreciate Objectivism, you must read ATLAS SHRUGGED.   Well, thanks but no thanks.  After suffering through some 700 pages of THE  FOUNTAINHEAD, I've served my time in hell. <br />Jean Paul Sartre had it all  wrong; hell isn't other people, its suffering through utterly boring books  such as THE FOUNTAINHEAD. Recommended solely as a textbook example of how  density is often confused with profundity.
B00003CWN3|5.0|The team that got this piece together, is genius. I haven't, in decades, seen a movie that had this much power over my feelings.  I truly carried it around in my soul for days and days.  Even now, two months later, I am in  awe.
B000002OX7|5.0|It's been almost thirty years, and this album still hasn't been topped. Some of the added songs are good, but the original album's nine songs are the most perfect studio rock album of all time.  Nothing by the Beatles,  the Stones, Zeppelin, Floyd, Dylan, Clapton, Hendrix, or anyone else can  top this masterpiece.  You cannot call yourself a rock-an-roll fan unless  you have this album.  Every original song is simply great.  Hardly anyone  ever mentions Goin' Mobile, and it may be the the lightest of the songs of  the album, but I love it just as much as the others.  &quot;Watch the  po-lice and the tax-man miss me, I'm mo-bile.&quot;  I love that line.   Needless to say, there are many other great lines as well.  As much as I  love the Beatles (and Zeppelin, and Floyd), it's never gotten any better  than this album.
B000009ED0|1.0|I didn't like this cd. All the songs were terrible and sounded the same. I haven't heard The History of Rock (and I don't want to), but who does this nut sack think he is sampling Sad But True? That used to be a great song. I  know one thing that's True is that kid rock is Sad.
0880381736|5.0|I read this book &amp; the rest of the 1st trilogy when they were first published in the mid-80's.  I just reread &quot;Autumn Twilight&quot; now, and enjoyed it more than ever.  It is an entertaining fantasy novel with  good character development and an interesting plot. The plot is not very  hard to follow so this is a good novel for a business trip.Although I'm  close to 30 now I still remember the days of playing D&amp;D in my youth  with fondness.  These novels capture the D&amp;D atmosphere more than any  other fantasy books I've read.
0780625129|5.0|This is an amazing film about a neo-nazi, white supremist from Venice Beach (Edward Norton) who is sent to prison after killing two black men but is in for only three years because the only witness is his brother (Edward  Furlong) who refuses to testify.     In prison Derek, (Edward Norton, the  same guy I mentioned earlier obviously) is subjected to the horrors of  prison life, and is reluctant to discover the truths about the wrongs  commited against the Black community and the Hispanic Community, etc.  through working in the laundry department with a black man in for several  years for &quot;resisting arrest&quot; and &quot;assaulting an  officer.&quot;    But it also appears that Derek had always been subjected  to hatred, from his father, from the man he looked up to in the neo-nazi  group, and from everything he'd read on the subject.     Derek, however,  after being released from prison wants to set things straight. He wants to  get his old job back and make sure his brother doesn't get involved in what  he did. However, to do this he needs to confront his old neo-nazi mentor,  and the rest of the hate group that used to look to him as god...    What  is so great about the film is it's strikingly new and original subject  matter. And the awesome use of black-and-white film to signify past events  and normal technicolor for the present. The performances are stellar.  Norton is all too believable as the former skinhead he portrays and almost  is too in character. The supporting cast does a fine job in its role as  well. But in American History X be prepared to be shocked and horrified by  the film and the horrors of the neo-nazi hate society.
0385493800|2.0|I have read all Grisham's books up to this one and have been so diappointed with the last two. The Street Lawyer and the Testament are real yawners. Usually I keep my Grisham novels, only loaning them out to trusted  friends, but these two I quickly gave away. The Testament dragged on, the  characters were very flat---either good or greedy with no interesting  nuances.
0440219078|5.0|If you want to read one of the best books in your life this is it!  It tells how all the scary and wonderful truths about how the world really is. Jonah and the Giver will lead you in a twisted tale having you guess what happens next.
0517201658|4.0|This is a great novel all the way until about the last 100 or so pages.  This is when the book begins to focus on Justine, a very unlikeable character.  I found myself just wishing that it would hurry up and be over.   The first 500 or so pages are a great story though!  If you are looking  for something easy to read and not too dramatic this is it.
0805062971|5.0|I hadn't seen the movie, but my friend recommended that I try the book first.  I enjoyed the prose which reminded me a lot of &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; style 2nd person narration.As a traveling businessman, I  sympathized with the main character's alienation in the beginning of the  story, but he totally let things get out of control.  It was interesting to  see how someone dissatisfied with their seemingly empty life can go to try  to make it more meaningful.
B000001FA4|5.0|This is undoubtably the most fine U2 album written.What one of the other reviews says is true - it is the bridge of the gap between the albums such war and Joshua Tree. This bridge, in my opinion, makes for the best U2.  What makes this album extra special is that each individual musician works  his instrument to levels of mastery never seen in any other U2 album.  Joshua Tree may be the best known album, but I can't help thinking that it  is dominated exclusively by the guitar work of the Edge. The later albums  although each of them are outstandingly clever and well crafted, become  more dominated by information technology.    <br />The Edge - in The  Unforgettable Fire his work varies from the energetic vibrance of Wire and  Pride to the sultry brilliance of Bad and Promenade. As far as guitar is  concerned, the syle is so varied the album doesn't represent the mere  product of a working musician, but a master in every area. Moreover I have  never heard in any other band a guitarist with the same style of Edge - how  many songs have you heard on the radio with the same guitar playing?     <br />Larry Mullen Jr. in my opinion represents the very escence of U2. In The  Unforgettable Fire he is more open in his drumming than in any other Album.  Without his varying drum lines and patterns U2 would not be U2 at all. In  this album he combines his Sunday Bloody Sunday brilliance with his extreme  technical perfection to produce such an amazing result that it is hard to  give any respect to other drummers. Try listening through Pride, A Sort Of  Homecoming and Wire and The....every song and listen for the extremely  understated excellence.    <br />It is hard to count out Mr Clayton because  his bass in this album is simply formidable.the sound of the title track is  made by him in harmony with the Edge. When you stop to listen to the song,  instead of letting it pass through ear to ear - like U2 does because it  seems to be like life itself - Adam Clayton's bass workis what holds it  all together.    I won't go into the styles of Bono but I'm sure you will  all agree that his input is absolutely invaluable.     <br />A Sort of  Homecoming, as #1 serves to get you in the rythmn of the new U2 beat. It's  frenetic drumming and logical but random guitar create such an atmosphere  as to actually lift your feet of the ground. It does actually sound like  travelling from place to place on tour - which is I think what it is about.  This is a relatively forgotten song but a delight that people only discover  now, 16 years on, if they but the album.   Pride simply goes without  saying. Simply everything about this song is perfect. Down to a T. It  doesn't seem to be remembered as a groove for Martin Luther King, moreover  as a powerfull swerve into the reality of life and love. This song contains  so much atmosphere that it is hard to forget where you were everytime  you've listened to it in a public place.     Wire is a great bridging song  between 2 of the 3 greats of the album. This is the song though that, in my  opinion, opitimises the 1980s U2 sound. Frenetic drumming, fast guitar  work, groovy bass and Bonos vocal chords on full. Complete with all of his  well-loved quirks.    The Unforgettable Fire is the most atmospheric song  of the album. It does not conform to the normal rules of U2 - it has  musically more side to it. It is my favorite song of the album. It was  written by Bono after visiting an exhibition (called the Unforgettable  Fire) in one of the Japenese Cities hit by an atom bomb in WW2. I can't  really see how the lyrics convey this fact but that is irrelevant. The song  wells up such massive feelings of nostalgia and fogotten memorys that it is  ill met in excellence, in my opinion, by any other U2 song.    Promenade is  another atmospheric great, along with 4th of July. It is fully  understandable why they put both of these shorter tracks on the album - to  give the listener a bit of a break after the first 4 andbefore Bad.  Nevertheless, Promenade I see as a mini Unforgettable Fire. This song is  utterly made by the excellence of the Edge. It has very much the same  nostalgeic effect as the song before.     Bad, is many people's favorite on  the album. Many pop singers count it as their favorite song ever, when  asked. I love it, as I do all U2 songs, but for me it does not conjure up  the same power as the songs formerly mentioned. It is definitely the  crescendo in Larry Mullen's drummin' that makes the song, and for all you  out there who want to know what it is about. I'm running out of time, but  all the other songs on the album have the same U2 effect and are no worse  one from the other. Try listening to them, and maybe you'll get the same  effect as me. <br />To close, if you have not bought this album you are  missing out on a huge chunk of life. If  I could I'd rate it 10*. Everytime  you listen to the first line - &quot;and you know its time to go&quot; - it  sounds different and more exciting.
079284632X|5.0|the greatest cult classic ever made..thats it thats all i gotta say
6304083769|5.0|In the year 2029 A.D, it seems that artificial intelligence makes up over half of the population of the earth. A.I. personalities known as &quot;ghosts&quot;, (another name for soul) live and control mechanical  bodies who excel combat, can brake down alcohol, and have super  intelligence, not to mention own further, more advanced technology.  A team  of A.I- cyborgs must stop a powerful computer hacker who calls him self  &quot;The Puppet Master&quot; who is hacking into the minds of local people  and different cyborgs, giving them artificial memories, and causing them to  hallucinate-forcing them to do as he commands.  <br />His whole mission is to  merge into the life of one cyborg; Kusanagi Motoko, who is more advanced,  and acts like a human- meanwhile trying to discover who she really is and  how she wants to be treated-like a human, or a machine. Love and emotions  are something that these cyborgs tend to forget about, which is sometimes  considered a flaw, but romance is definitely what's NOT on these soldier's  mind.    Durring the climax with the puppeteer, Kusanagi discovers that it  is not just herself that she doubts at time, but the technology she is  built with. She is told my the Puppet Master when he enters her mind, that  they are more a like than she really thinks, and if they merge, they will  be the most powerful cyborg there is. Kusanagi is tempted, but stands her  ground inside of her mind and refuses his offer.  <br />From a former  encounter with a man's power tank, Kusanagi's old body was left as nothing  but a shattered wreck that was beyond repair. She regains life, however,  now inside the body of a young child and then sets off searching for the  right path in which to lead her to a new destiny.   Directed by Mamoru  Oshii, this is one of the best anime movies that I have ever seen. It's  more of an animated version of &quot;The Matrix&quot; with interesting  (strange) music, good dubbing, and good fighting scenes. The story was  difficult to follow, and it might take a second viewing to fully grasp the  plot. However this is a film that surly should be given a viewing by all  anime fans-you'll like this one. Also, Matrix fans should check this out.   Animation in this film a somewhat of the different and more realistic  looking sides of anime, and again, the abnormal, yet interesting hair  colors come into play. Not for young kids, this movie contains nudity,  violence, language-just your typical anime movie.
0767821629|5.0|I ENJOYED THE MOVIE VERY MUCH.  THE REVIEWS I READ ON THE MOVIE WERE MIXED. I THINK THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS CLOSE TO THAT OF THE MATRIX BUT NOT AS COMPLEX. IT'S NOT A SPECIAL EFFECTS EXTRAVAGANZA, BUT IT IS INTELLIGENT  SCIENCE-FICTION WITH JUST ENOUGH SPECIAL EFFECTS TO MAKE THE MOVIE WORK  PROPERLY.  AND SOME OF THE CONCEPTS THE MOVIE PRESENTS MAKES YOU THINK  ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A MOVIE JUST TO SIT AND ESCAPE  INTO FANTASY LAND FOR AWHILE, THEN I RECOMMEND IT.
B00004STPT|5.0|FEW MOVIES have penetrated my soul like Gladiator. In fact, I have never seen a movie on the big screen more than once until this one; to date, I have seen it four times. I will see it once more. Each viewing is better  and more meaningful than the last. <br />This CD, the first soundtrack I have  ever felt compelled to purchase, is as haunting, meaningful, and masterful  as the movie it supports. Its haunting rich eastern melodies, lush  understated vocals, and studied ambiguity conjure up images of the meaning  of Gladiator--the human struggle for dignity, virtue, honor, and revenge,  while hanging from one's heart like a lead weight. If you have a family, a  sense of generational history, and an imagination, you will love the  movie's soundtrack as much as the movie itself. <br />Some viewers/listeners  simply are not able or do not have the ability to appreciate the depth of  characterization, the sweeping life metaphors, and ultimate transcendant  (and uplifting) message in a movie like Gladiator.
B00003CX5A|5.0|I loved Sleepy Hollow. Burton really hit the nail on the head with this. Over a span of 2 years, I went from a person that watched comedies and Disney films to movies like Sleepy Hollow and I Know What you did Last  Summer. I have a very healthy respect for this movie, and everyone that has  watched it knows why. I loved the horse scenes and how talented the  headless horseman was, but was upset that I didn't get to see Icabod's head  hacked off. Darn. =/ It was different from the book in some ways, but in  many others was alike. All in all, Sleepy Hollow is one of my favorite  movies now, and-though I am surprised it is rated R- was very  interesting.(I loved the part where the people's heads came ou of the tree  and were moving around. cool! &lt;3 Jess)
6305399212|5.0|&quot;Aliens&quot; is that rarest of movies: - A sequel which surpasses a popular original; - A movie with an unknown cast, many of whom (Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, et al)went on to become major players in Hollywood); -  A pro-military Hollywood flick; - A well-stirred mixture of scifi, horror,  comedy, war movie, and political satire which somehow comes off as  realistic nonetheless<br />Now add a &quot;Special Edition&quot; which is  truly significant to the mix.  <br />&quot;Aliens-The Special Edition&quot;  includes about 20 minutes of additional footage to this classic popcorn  flick.  Believe it or not, the additional footage actually improves the  movie, providing more background to the alien infestation of the  terraforming colony and adding to the dramatic tension as the aliens attack  the colonial marines and prove they are smarter than previously thought.   <br />For those few who have never seen this movie, it concerns the return of  flight lieutenant Ripley to the system where her original crew had  encountered a vicious alien species, an encounter which only Ripley  survived.  After drifting through space in suspended animation for two  generations, Ripley finds that the planet where the aliens were discovered  has been settled by terraformers hoping to turn it into a colony.  The  settlers soon find a an alien shipwreck and a cargo of alien eggs, after  which all contact is lost.  <br />Ripley then accompanies a squadron of  gung-ho colonial marines to the planet to investigate.  Needless to say,  this is anything but a routine mission.  <br />Director James Cameron had the  onerous task of trying to outdo Ridley Scott (director of  &quot;Alien&quot;) at his own game.  Powered by a superb cast including  Biehn, Paxton, Lars Henrikson, Paul Reiser, and Sigourney Weaver, Cameron  accomplishes his mission---his sequel is even scarier and more  tightly-plotted than its predecessor.  <br />Grab a copy of this incredible  movie by any means necessary, butwhen you watch it, do yourself a  favor--leave the lights on.

0688170528|5.0|I saw a review of Jodi Picoult's latest book, Plain Truth, in People Magazine and while waiting for Plain Truth to come out in paperback, picked up The Pact.  WOW! What an incredicle book!  I couldn't put it down.   Picoult has a wonderful talent for making the characters become very real  and very alive.  I found myself thinking about the characters at work and  having to remind myself that they weren't real!  I really felt like i got  to know Emily and Chris.  I cried with Emily and grieved with Chris.  It  was such an incredible story!
158234082X|5.0|I have just finished this book and I loved it.I have been a chef for 20 years and i have seen all this and more in that time.I am still howling about the hidden side towels in the ceiling.How many times have I seen  that.This book really discribes what goes on in the heat of battle on a  busy night.The feeling of being &quot;weeded&quot;giving the well done  steak a &quot;little love&quot;in the microwave.I especilly enjoyed the  chapter&quot;a day in the life&quot;that is my day to a tee right down to  spinning out the next days prep list in your head as you drift off to sleep  after a twelve hour day  I will be passing this book onto my line cooks and  I am sure that they will enjoy It as much as I did.Im sure that many people  will be shocked by the vulgarity and discriptions of &quot;selling the old  seefood at brunch&quot;but it is all true.For people who have never been in  &quot;dantes inferno&quot;during a busy rush.When the orders are pouring  in,when the greese trap backs up,when the saute cook cuts his hand wraps it  with duct tape and fires the salmon without missing a beat.The pressure is  unbelivable.That is why cooks are so crazy.And dont kid yourself.We are all  a little crazy.We have to be to survive.There is a saying in the  kitchen.&quot;If you dont love it get out now.You will end up hating  it&quot;I recomend this book to any cook out there.He or she will enjoy it  and see a little bit of themselves in it.By the way I pull hot sizzle pans  out of the oven with my bare hands all the time and my cooks love it
B000003TAR|5.0|After the last few months I feel deeply regretfull I only gave Nevermind 4 stars.  Since I made that review I have listened to that tape so many times its a wonder it still stays together (It's actually cracked).  After much  debate I took the consumer reviewers' advice and picked &quot;In  Utero&quot; as my third (after &quot;Unplugged&quot;) Nirvana album.  And  my only response is: &quot;wow&quot;.<br />I think the thing that is most  communicated by &quot;In Utero&quot; is anguish, mainly thanks to Kurt  Cobain's eerie voice that can change itself from the quiet whisper of the  wind to a shrieking demon out of hell come to gobble up poor rock stars who  can't cope with their fame.  Combined with the driving guitar, compelling  bass, and fantastic drums and even a cello sound occasionally (is it one?   I know it is on &quot;Unplugged&quot;)this album's music matches its fiery  lyrics.  When finished listenening I always feel unsettled, like I have  tapped just a little bit of Cobain's hell and just maybe understand a bit  of why he did what he did.  From the accompanyment jacket art alone you can  see how desperate he was becomming.  It is a moving, personal album that I  recommend to true Nirvana fans but warn the casual listener it is a deep  album.<br />Of note: &quot;Serve the Servants&quot;, &quot;Heart Shaped  Box&quot;, &quot;All Apologies&quot;, &quot;Rape Me&quot;
0792156684|4.0|when you consider the price of the Titanic DVD,I would have thought some extras(documentaries,interviews)could have been added.For me,the most chilling scene in the movie was seeing that epic wide screen shot of all  those people drowning in the water.It has outstanding special effects and  seeing the real Titanic at the bottom of the sea was a bonus.I hope that  when the special edition comes out,those extras will be provided.
B000005J56|3.0|primero que nada, compre el cd con aprehension, temi que ry cooder no cuajara con el son cubano, pero ry cooder es un excelente musico y como tal supo bien que hacer en esta ocasion; no estorbar. la calidad del disco es  a1, ultra profesional, lo cual es coincidentemente su punto mas alto y a mi  parecer, el mas discutible. esto se supone que sea musica autentica y  legitima, pero los estandares en los que se presenta este cd no son reales  para este tipo de musica, es facil olvidar al oir este disco que esta es  musica de cantina y de barrio y tal como se presenta en el cd, todo suena  diseniado (al parecer) de forma que sea posible su aceptacion en primer  mundo. puedo parecer un pesado, pero es que me pone un poco triste el que  nuestra cultura latina (y eso que no soy un experto en musica cubana) tenga  que ser amoldada para que sea aceptada en este mundo  &quot;globalizado&quot;. sin embargo, las composiciones son buenas y se  tambien que en el fondo las intenciones son buenas, solo queria advertirles  que no esperen un sonido sonero cubano muy original, como yo lo hice en un  principio, oiran en cambio algo hecho para cuadrar con los estandares de la  &quot;world music&quot; actual. finalmente supongo que a ry cooder al igual  que a david byrne podemos perdonarles muchas cosas, despues de todo, son  musicos buenos e integros. con todo, es un disco bastante interesante.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Pearl Jam first exploded onto the Seattle rock scene in the early 90's Along with other seattle Grunge bands like Soundgarden and Alice in Chains.  But it is obvious that Pearl Jam is by far the best and most talented band  to come out of seattle in the early 90's, and it's proven once again with  the release of their 6th studio effort \\"Binaural\\" that Pearl Jam  as Musicians, pocess what it takes to create an album with such Artistic  bliss.  Unfortunatelly this is not the Album for anyone who still thinks of  Pearl Jam as the Band who first Blessed us with their earlier works like  \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.  Pearl Jam have evolved from the grunge music  scene to create well crafted Anthems and using their musical intellect to  create a new sound to their music.  Here on \\"Binaural\\" which by  the way is the most Creative album title in a very long time, the band  provides their fans with what it their most listener friendly record, with  songs Like the album's opener \\"Breakerfall\\" and \\"God's  Dice\\", you get 2 quick hard Rockin tunes one after another, and  quickly moving on to other mid-tempo songs, like \\"Light Years\\"  and \\"thin Air\\", which are both Written Magnifiscently by Eddie  Vedder, and Guitarist Stone Gossard.  \\"Binaural\\" also benefits  from the Musical influence of former  soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron who  is rejoining Pearl Jam for the first time since \\"Temple Of The  Dog\\", and actually penned the music to the Eddie Vedder written song,  \\"Evacuation\\".  \\"Binaural\\" also features music and  Lyrics by Basist Jeff Ament in songs such as the Radio hit single  \\"Nothing as it seems\\" which also has some Pink Floyd like Blues  guitar works by the Amazing Mike McCready, who is Arguably, one of the best  Rock Guitarists of the 90's.  Altogether, \\"Binaural\\" is a great  effort by Pearl Jam, and it should make a great addition to any Pearl Jam  fan's Collection, and The songs \\"Incignifinace\\" and  \\"Grievance\\" should not be missed by any hard rock fan.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Human Clay is very good. At first I only liked about two songs higher and With arms wide open now I like I like all the cd.My favorite songs on the cd are Faceless Man and Inside Us All.This cd is well worth the money.
6305910103|3.0|There are claims by the film company that this film cost $12 million,but I remember reading at the time it's budget was only 3 and a half million dollars.Shot by a TV film crew,it re-uses effects from the first  film,re-uses the same bridge set(redressed)no less than 3 times and the  Eden Cave effect is cheap and terrible.The sets are cheap with the room  Spock meets his fate in looking more like a disco dance floor than a power  room.On the plus side ST2 has terrific action scenes(better effects in the  battle scene),good script,good direction,good acting and a great music  score.However,Star Trek 4 and 6 are better movies(due to Leonard Nimoy's  efforts as director on 4 and producer on 6). ST:TNG First Contact and  Insurrection are better films,due in part to their bigger budgets.But ST2  is well done for it's time,although the Eden Cave effect should be  re-done.Footnote...why doesn't Paramount get the support actors to do a  commentary on a DVD.What great Shatner stories they could tell!
B000002MY3|5.0|Jagged Little Pill is a mixture of all kinds of song. All have meaningful and/or philosophical lyrics, and Alanis has contributed to most of them. I liked the way that some of them had a rebellious, powerful side to them and  then had a slow, moody feel (&quot;Perfect&quot; was one) as well. I loved  Alanis' cynical ways of looking at life in &quot;All I Really Want&quot;  and &quot;Not the Doctor&quot; especially, but a lot of them did. It was a  great album, but I think &quot;Right Through You&quot; was ok, but it was  lacking in the kick the other songs have and sounded like the songwriter  was running out of ideas at that moment in time. It was definitely a  special album, though and Alanis Morissette is a singer who you can't  ignore.
0767903854|5.0|A new Bill Bryson book is always a treat of the highest magnitude.  I preordered this book and counted down the days until its arrival.  This book was as wonderful as his previous efforts, in fact, maybe even more so  because it hit so close to home.  As a former Sydney gal, I miss my  homeland and Mr. Bryson reminded me of why.  He takes the reader on a  journey that most people (including most Aussies) would never go on;  Australians tend to travel abroad before exploring their own country.  I  think anyone who reads this book will want to actually travel to this  beautiful country and explore its riches. The reader will discover that  there's more to Australia than Kangaroos and Foster's Beer (which no  self-respecting Aussie would ever drink.) The author introduces us to the  colorful locals and explains in painful, yet hilarious detail, how he gets  from place to place.  He has toned down the sarcasm for this book, and one  almost gets the impression that he just likes the place too darn much.   This book will not disappoint fans of his previous books.  Thank you, Mr.  Bryson, for writing a humorous, yet flattering book about the most  under-appreciated country on the planet!
B00004T8RK|4.0|Let's face it. This album is not bad at all, but it's not what we expected. IT IS NOT a great album. It has 6 great songs and that's it. I love Pearl Jam and I will keep buying their albums but I wish they produced  another masterpiece like Ten or Vs. Don't get me wrong. It's not that I  long  (like many do) for another Ten. I like the way they 're changing and  I think Light Years and Given To Fly are top songs. But Ten had 11 great  songs while Binaural has 6 and Yield had some 5. I don't know where the  problem is. So many new stupid bands come up with a great album but Pearl  Jam can't fill their new one with great songs. I hate it.
076783819X|4.0|Wow.  I have seen many movies, but this was one of the most amazing film I've ever seen.  Usually, in this kind of action thriller, the main character saves himself and all the good people at the end, with the  &quot;bad guy&quot; ending up dead or arrested.  However, this film is not  one of those.  You don't often find me saying &quot;wow&quot; to the movie  that I have just watched, but this film is an exception.  It was the most  satisfying story that I have ever seen.  I like movies that actually have  meanings, unlike movies that are made just for the profit purposes.  I like  movies that blows me away.  And this was one of those.  Tim Robbins like  always, was amazingly attractive.  Though as scary as his character was, I  was attraced to him than ever before.  He in my opinion is one of the most  talented beautiful looking actor around.  The topic was really exciting.   Terrorism and war films are always filled with action and is excitng.   After all, the unexpected ending just blew me away.  This film is strongly  recommended.
B00001SIES|4.0|This is a fantastic album. The highlight is 'Unintended'. There is definately a Radiohead influence but that can only be a good thing. Another fantastic album by a British group, who along with Travis and Radiohead are  offering an alternative to the uninspired kiddie-pop which has dominated  the charts for too long.
B000023X9W|5.0|All Neil Young fans who were puzzled by him not only reuniting with Crosby , Stills and Nash but appearing to enjoy the experience of being amongst fellow ageing hippies as they relived experiences of yesteryear may find  the explanation in this album .<br />             Neil Young has travelled a  long way over the thirty , or is it now approaching forty  years , and this  album seems somewhat reflective as he appears to return to his musical  roots . On &quot; Buffalo Springfield Again &quot; he would to yearn for  times gone by as he sings ; &quot; Like to see those guys again / And give  it a shot / Maybe now we can show the world / What we got &quot; ; is he  suggesting a reformation of things as they used to be ? Crosby , Stills ,  Nash and Young...Reprise ?<br />             Silver and Gold appears to be a  superb trip in nostalgia , tracks slow , dreamy with fabulous acoustic play  and Neil Young's haunting vocals .<br />              Superb musical  arrangements and performances only help to enhance the album further . Not  a poor track to listen to and if you are a fan of the  &quot; Harvest  &quot;  &quot; After The Goldrush &quot; or , the not as well known but my  personal favourite album &quot; Old Ways &quot; then I am sure you will  find this album a veritable treat .
B000005RNQ|5.0|I can't be bothered to explain why I think this album is so good. Look , just buy it , alright?
B000002NHN|5.0|Last year, my friend brought over the Book of Secrets album. She said it was her moms and she thought i would like it. Well as soon as i herd the first song i was in love with it! She also loved it and shes not one to  like or even listen to any other music except pop and r&amp;b music, but  she loved it too.I was thrilled and went out and bought it that day! Her  music is so beautiful!  when your feeling down, just listen to this album,  soon you will be dancing and singing along. Loreena's voice is so uplifting  and the middle easten with celtic sound is absolutely wonderful. I still  listen to this CD at least once a day and it is still my absolute favorite.  There is a mixture of music on here that will definatly move you. When I  listen to this, my imagination takes me to a beautiful place in the woods  like the bards of long ago,  and sends me singing and dancing to the  different varieties of music. I guarantee you wil like the Book of Secrets,  if not love. I would not give up this CD for any other in the world!
B00004LMAH|5.0|this is an excellent and very different album a must for any music lover.From the heavy rock of i can see a liar to the soothing beat of little james this is definetly a classic
B00003CX5A|3.0|This good offering from Tim Burton is bound to please his fans. The movie is visually captivating, with a grand style all it own. The sets (almost all of it was done on soundstages) are magnificent. Johnny Depp's bumbling  Icabod Crane is also an involving character.I also greatly admire Danny  Elfman's musical score which adds immensly to the fim. &quot;Sleepy  Hollow's&quot; only flaw lies with its script which departs greatly from of  Irving's original story and eventually becomes a confused supernatural  mess.As can be expected with Burton, the movie does have some gory  sequences which venture on &quot;overkill&quot;. Certainly worth a rental.  Real fans will want the DVD which features an excellent matted image that  keeps the movie's dark look sharp. Other features include a dull Tim Burton  commentary which occasionly comes to life when he discusses a well rembered  scene or problem encountered while filming. Of more interest is a 30 min.  featurette detailing the filming and the comlicated special effects.  Another 11 min. cast interview segment is included along with cast notes,  trailers and a superficial still file (about 24 production photos).  Surprisingly this is a Paramount release. Paramount has been stingey about  adding extra features with past releases, perhaps they are begining to  loosen up.
B000005RTD|5.0|This album is that rarest of things- a truly 5 star album.Look , just buy it ,alright?
0385484518|5.0|I loved this book. Tuesdays with Morrie is a refreshing reminder that life can be and is wonderful in each moment.<br />If you enjoyed Tuesdays with Morrie, I highly recommend a book called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T  WORK: A BOOK ABOUT INSTANTANEOUS TRANSFORMATION&quot; by Ariel and Shya  Kane.  THIS IS A GREAT BOOK! <br />To me the Kanes' book is an easy to read  guide to living in the moment which inturn has enabled me to have a rich,  rewarding and loving life, including my work and relationships.<br />I highly  recommend the Kanes' book to anyone interested in having their own LIFE be  one of CONTINUOUS WONDERFUL MOMENTS.
B00000BKDS|5.0|Yes Iron Maiden are good but why don't you also try out that forgotten NWOBHM band Saxon ( Who? you say).They're good too, but more like heavy rock n roll than heavy metal.A warning though, DON'T buy the album &quot;A  Collection of Metal, it has a very poor song choice. Try &quot;Wheels of  Steel&quot; or &quot;Power and the Glory&quot; or their recent stuff.In  Britain Saxon were almost as popular as Maiden at one point but somehow  never quite made in in the US.Yes, I know I'm not reviewing this album  much,but what the hell. Up the Irons!
B00003CX95|5.0|Thank you very very very much Mr. Gibson. Finally the greatest movie ever  made comes to the world of the DVD magic. Truly a must have for everyone.
B000002KDO|4.0|I find it surprising that some people critisise Black Sabbath for their supposedly Satanic image, and are quite willing to overlook the fact that one of the most overrated bands ever-Led Zeppelin-has a picture of naked  children on their &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; album...
B000001ZS5|3.0|Magnetic Fields is a highly charged studio album from the start of the eighties. It consists of 5 parts performed on new digital synths the &quot;Fairlight&quot; which Jarre was one of the first people to get his  hands on. It's a good album, but one of Jarre's weakest studio turnouts.  <br />Magnetic Fields 2 is perhaps the most well known track from the album  but sounds quite cheesy and along with part 5 (The Last Rhumba) are what  bring the album down. Sound quality still sounds as bright and as energetic  as anything made today - amazing.
B000005Z0E|4.0|Tupac Shakur has always been sold under his real price. He was a truly sharp minded, intelligent human being. He could have changed society, if he stayed on school instead of droping out of high-school. He prefeared to  tell the world about the problems of blacks through his music. His first  album is full of shocking facts about the life in the ghetto. The story of  young Brenda, his brake-through single talks about teenage pregnancies.  Soulja Story is about the violence that rules in the ghetto.<br />Tupac Shakur  found his way to tell the society...and this are his first wordz!
B00000DCHI|5.0|I finally decided to review an older cd I have.  This cd is awesome.  The Piano Man, Billy Joel, has delivered a hits album for the ages.  Some of the best Billy Joel songs are on this.  My favorites are Piano Man, Captain  Jack, Uptown Girl, and my personal favorite Billy Joel song, Goodnight  Saigon.  From the sad ballads to the uptempo dance songs, this album is  Billy Joel's best.  I reccomend anyone of you who read this should buy this  because it is an awesome cd, even if you hate Billy Joel, you'll love this.   This is a greatest hits album for the ages, actually from 1978-1985, in  which all the songs are from that time.  That time is Billy Joel's best.   It is when he recorded his most memorable songs.  I have two copies of this  album, one on tape and one on cd.  If you want a greatest hits album from  absolutely anyone ad you're not so sure which to get, buy this one because  it is the best.  The absolute best.  So take my word for it and buy this  album today!
B0000365JA|5.0|I don't know  exactly when I realised, that Bryan Adams is doing the music I want to listen to. As far as I remember I appreciated his songs since I was old enough to turn on the radio on my own (don't laugh, I'm only 18  years old). But some years ago I was completely caught by the magic of  Bryan's music. I bought every CD that exists (well almost every...I couldn  manage to get rid of the asian releases) and as I heard that &quot;the best  of me&quot; will be released in Austria I was one of the first who bought  the CD. It was about the time I experienced my first live concert of Bryan  and I thought nothing could be compared to this event. Well when I played  the CD for the first time I felt the same with this album. Truly the most  shaking &quot;best of&quot;-album released ever, although I think Bryan's  best hits could fill 2 CD's, not only one. I like the artwork of the cover  and the inlay as well. Dirk Rudolph did a good job there. And Bryan did a  good job with most of the black/white-photographes as well. These are the  titles: 1. The Best of me: This track makes its way into the hall of fame  of the best lovesongs ever written. 2. Can't stop this thing we started:  You might stop a hurricane, but this title is unstopable. A great song if  you want to know wheather you are alife or not by turning on your HiFi. 3.  I'm ready: actualy this one is a live version from MTV unplugged, a more  slow version than the original rock balade. It gives me shivers down my  spire everytime I hear the powerfull music starts to play. 4. summer of  '69: the storry of 10 year old Bryan trying to play his first guitar. THE  song that stands for Bryan Adams. It has been voted 3rd best song ever in  Austria. A truly timeless rock song. 5. let's make a night to remember: I  like the song, especialy when I'm in love. It's a real great song, full of  desire and the woman he wrote it for must be a real special person. 6. all  for love: I bought the single when it was out, becauseI liked the film the  three musketeers that featured the song as a soundtrack. The three of them  (BA, Sting, Rod Steward) did a great work with the song. 7. have you ever  really loved a woman: The spanish guitar and gives a flair of &quot;la vida  espagna&quot;. The song from the film Don Huan de Marco (I hope it's  spelled like that). 8. run to you: one of Bryan's classic hits, I think  that it's best experienced live... 9. cloud number nine (chicane mix): I  personaly like the chicane mix better than the original and the song is a  great product of the cooperation between two great artists. There are two  lines: &quot;now he hurt you and you hurt me&quot; that I think everyone  who has ever loved in vain is familiar with. But this song of course is a  &quot;happy end&quot; song as almost everyone of Bryan's titles. 10. I do  it for you: Soundtrack to: Robin Hood - Prince of theves. His best song if  you ask me. Moving and powerfull alike. Actualy this is the one I always  appreciated, before I even knew that I like Bryan Adams. 11. back to you:  An unplugged version. Mickey Curry unbeatable on the drums. In the end it  reminds me of the title song to &quot;a mountie in chicago&quot; 12. when  you are gone: great duet, though not the best ever, but truly a good one.  13. please forgive me: second best lovesong by him. Im almost crying  everytime I hear this one. 14. the only thing that looks good on me is you:  I didn't like this one until I heard it live at the concert. But now I'm  glad it's featured on the CD. 15. inside out: almost as good as please  forgive me (the video is also on the CD, I was surprised to discover it  when I tried to run the disk on my computer. A feature that enriches the  CD!  check it out! ) If you thought that's all, you are wrong. There is  another surprise: Everyone awaits 15 titles, but there is a 16th, that is  not written on the cover: It's the second title by the BA/chicane project -  don't give up. If you don't know wheather you should buy this album or not,  here's my advice: BUY IT !
B000002U9W|5.0|Everyone who reads a review of a PF Album wants to know what the reviewers tastes are, while I'll tell you that aside from The Basic Darkside and Wall Norm, I love almost everything Pf produced prior to Waters untimley  departure, the only exception to this might be More, but perhaps the most  under-ratted album they ever produced, even more then Animals, is Atom  Heart Mother. The Pinnical of Waters Genius is shown on the title track.  The transitions are smooth and mind boggeling in beauty. The 23 Min. Song  is musical Bliss. The Combination of Brass, Guitar, sampling,and Choral  music is trully astounding. The other tracks are masterfully done as well,  especially Fat Old Son, and If. Allan's psycadellic Breckfast is humorous  and a delight to listen to too. All in all this ablum is a must have for  anyone who loves music, and an &quot;Oh my God how can you not have  it&quot; for a Floydian. This ablum is unparraled by anything in the Pink  Floyd arsenal, except possibly for Shine on You Crazy Dimond Parts 6-9. But  this now!
B00004U2HK|4.0|This is a truly great movie . The music, the scenery as well as the story are top notch. A MUST  for all movie collections.
0446310786|5.0|This book was on my reading list last year, and I wanted to read it.  The only problem was, when I went to check it out of a library, there were no copies of it left!  And now, I finally found out know why.  This book is  absolutely amazing.<br />This is the story of a small Alabama town in 1935.   It is told through the eyes of a girl nicknamed Scout, who is  heartbreakingly frank about her feelings for her enviornment.  The book  reads quickly; you find yourself drawn into Scout's preceptions of the  world around her, and you learn with her the injustices and surprises of  life.<br />I am sorry to say that life in Alabama hasn't changed much in the  past 65 years.  I couldn't believe how much I could relate to the book,  being a native Alabamian myself (my city even get a mention :) ).  With  this book, I've found a way to explain to others what it's really like to  live in the South.
B00004TEWP|5.0|This CD is much better than the &quot;...Oops I Did It Again&quot; that she released in America because it has 3 extra tracks. The song &quot;Heart&quot; is included, which is a song that is very sweet...if you  like &quot;Dear Diary&quot; then you should listen to &quot;Heart&quot;
0553573403|5.0|This book is the beggining of a wonderful story of a world of magic and kingdoms that seems so real you will think your there.  The plot is so unpredictable you will never know what is coming next.  The people are real  and you will come to love them, hate them, and sometimes you'll feel a  little bit of both.
6305603847|5.0|The first time I saw this movie in the movie theater, I was not impressed. I had owned a few copies of the album since its release. I feel to this day that it is the greatest rock album ever made.  The interpretation onto the  screen is, to me, fairly accurate.  A few years later, when the movie was  released on video, I again saw it.  This time it was at a party in my home  where certain illegal substances had been inhaled. This time, it was as if  I'd seen the movie for the first time. I was able to see the movie in an  all new perspective. In my drug/alcohol-induced stupor, I saw images that  were totally indescribable.  The animation seemed to come virtually alive.   The movie spoke to me like no other ever has to this day. Whenever I have  watched this movie &quot;straight&quot;, it seems rather dull, however  under the influence, it takes on a whole new life of its own, and never  seems to tell the same story twice.  The rock culture and the drug culture  grew to the point where they intermingled together to become one and the  same.  This movie exemplifies that intermingling.  Therefore to interpret  this movie is nearly impossible, because like the effects of mind altering  substances and music, no two people are necessarily affected in the same  way.  In conclusion, I can only say that it must be experienced and judged  individually.
B0000062GE|5.0|Stabbing Westward is easily one of the best bands in history.  The smooth mixture between heavy and soft music creates a sound unlike any other.  The lyrics bring out every emotion you can think of, and it's just a straight  out amazing CD(though not their best-that title goes to Ungod).  What I  really like is how they can get heavy, with screaming vocals, and it still  manages to hold its melodic rhythm.  This was the first Stabbing Westward  CD I bought, and it gained my intrest in one of the world's greatest bands.   BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW!  You'll take it home and never want to stop  listening to it.  It's simple as that.  So quit reading this.  Buy the CD!
B000000OQY|4.0|Lies is a pretty good album but not the masterpiece some reviewers claim. It wasn't designed with much thought, just thrown together quickly as a way to buy time between the eventual mega success of Appetite for Destruction and the \\"difficult second album\\" Use Your Illusion I and II. That said, most of it is pretty good. Out of the four live songs, the cover of Aerosmith standard \\"Mama Kin\\" is great, and the rest are adequate.     The new acoustic songs fare better. \\"Patience,\\" as we all know, is a masterpiece, and many have bought the album for it alone.\\"Used to Love Her\\" is fun though not too riveting. \\"One in a Million\\" is great, with biting lyrics that can be taken out of context. \\"You're Crazy\\" was much better on Appetite.    This is not essential, but you probably should get it anyway since we may never see any new material from the original band.
0783231202|3.0|It is difficult to believe that the same man who made Schindler's List could have made this painfully earnest, hopelessly editorialized &quot;version of events.&quot;  All this [true] story needed was to be  told, simply and straightforwardly.  It's been crying out to be told ever  since the issues it raises were [somewhat] settled by the American Civil  War. But the minute I heard that disembodied chorus of voices on the  soundtrack, always reserved for the most solemn subjects, I could tell  Speilberg was floundering.  Schindler's List was so chaste, so reticent in  its presentation of the [true] story, that it was Speilberg's greatest  triumph that he managed to tell it without any of his usual filmic  flourishes - lavished on his usual trivialities.  The tale of Amistad  deserved the same care and reticence - after all, the story could easily  tell itself. What Spielberg lacked was a script.  An A for effort, though.
B00000DMJF|5.0|If you love pop rock, this is the 2-CD set to get!It comes with a unique case,two little folders that hold the two CD's with the Apple logo inprinted on them. It comes with for pictures of the  Beatles(john,paul,george,ringo). It also comes with a colage of pictures  together as a poster and lirics to all the songs on the album. The music is  basicly the same with to aditional songs and with a different recording of  the song &quot;Revolution&quot;. Other than that the music is the same. But  that dosen't mean it's boring!Every song is unique an ingenious. It the CD  only genious' could of recorded, THE WHITE ALBUM!
1559408855|1.0|This is the only movie I have ever seen that has a bibliography in the credits. The bibliography mentions writers like Roland Barthes and Simone de Beauvoir who might be able to explain the content of this film since  nothing in the film itself explains why anybody would make such a  disgusting, bitter movie or what this inhuman spectacle could possibly   mean.<br />I doubt those writers can accomplish what the director failed to  accomplish and redeem this film.<br />I have never seen anything as awful and  life negating as this movie. And its no wonder. I have never been an active  member of Hitler's SS. Only the cruelest and most sadistic moron could  enjoy this movie. It is repugnant and rejects every decency of which man is  capable.<br />There is no reason to watch this movie. Only if you are like me,  all these warnings will only serve to make you search out the video  cassette, thinking, &quot;Damn, how bad could it be?&quot;<br />I had to cover  my eyes over some of it and I am not a squeemish person. This movie is  really an atrocity. &quot;Nothing is shocking,&quot; a lot of people say,  but this movie shocks and its not a good shock. Watching this movie is like  being in hell. It really is. If you are smart you will avoid it. At least  be kind and watch it alone. Do not subject your friends or loved ones to  this filth.
1558908498|3.0|All I have to say about the ending of this movie is WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING?  I am a true Scream fan!  I loved the first movie, it was like a wake up call to horror flicks, and it began this chain of new comers  such as I know what you did last summer.  But really, I loved Jerry  O'connels singing scene, but umm where do they get off throwing details  every which way.  Don't get me wrong though, i loved this movie, but only  because i love like every horror movie, all i'm saying is the ending is a  bit cheesey and they could've spared us all the &quot;Why did you do  it?&quot; details.
B00003CWOL|5.0|When one sits down with a group of film producers and suggests that he wants to do a humorous film about religion, I'm sure that there is a bit of hesitance.  But luckily for us, Kevin Smith, the writer and director of  such movies as Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy, has hit another winner  with Dogma.  The movie begins with a disclaimer, and rightfully so,  about how this is a piece of fiction and not some hostile take-over of  organized religion.  Despite that, this film was met with harsh criticism,  debate, and even protesters from members and leaders of the Catholic  Church. Shortly after, we meet the movie's protagonist, Bethany (Linda  Fiorentino), an employee at an abortion clinic whose Catholic faith seems  to be dwindling by the minute.  She is no longer moved by her faith; she  thinks that God is dead.  She couldn't be any more wrong.  As she reaches  the low point in her faith, she is spoken to by the Angel of God (Alan  Richman) who challenges her to a mission for God:  she is charged with  saving the world.  Bethany is joined by the staple characters of a Kevin  Smith film, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).  Further  rounding out the rather notable cast is George Carlin as a Cardinal and  Chris Rock as an apostle.  Her quest is so direly important due to a  glitch in Catholic teaching.  Two fallen angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and  Loki (Matt Damon), who have been banished to earth by God because they quit  their Angel duties, have discovered a way back to heaven.  They learned  that during a rededication of a cathedral in New Jersey, all of the sins of  those who pass through the doors of the church would be forgiven.  This  process is known as plenary indulgence.  The reason that this must be  prevented is that anything that goes against the word of God proves him  wrong.  That would undo creation and end life as we know it. This movie  seems to assemble an unusual array of concepts and ideas.  The most obvious  one is the contradiction in a film that speaks of religion and yet has  gratuitous use of profanity.  This movie makes many jokes at organized  religion, particularly Catholicism, incorporates some low-brow humor, and  even manages to squeeze in a bit of intellectual and constructive criticism  of religion.  Though one would assume that a movie that strives to have  such mass appeal would have little thoughtful ideology behind the very  faith that they are criticizing, that is where this movie becomes  unexpectedly good.  The jokes that poke fun at Catholicism are funny, yet  poignant.  They all seem to unite behind the movie's overwhelming support  of Christianity and faith, if you watch it long enough to realize that.   Those who dismiss this movie as purely an attack on organized religion  failed to fully comprehend the movie and understand the point that Kevin  Smith sought to make.  This movie's focus appears to be to provoke  thought.  For each criticism there is of organized religion, there is a  suggestion as to how to make faith more true, alive, and personal.  It  seems as though the movie operated on enough levels so that one who has no  knowledge of Catholicism could be entertained and a bit enlightened.  Yet  one with a deep knowledge of the faith could, with an open mind, leave  feeling refreshed about their faith, with a few new ideas, and certainly  something to think about.  The movie's portrayal of God is also  refreshing.  Instead of the God who judges from on high, we are met with a  different one.  For this film, Smith emphasizes God as a loving,  compassionate God, with an almost childlike love for humanity.  I found  this to be the most refreshing and insightful portrayal I have seen for  God.  I commend Smith on his writing of this character, but I do have one  problem with it: the actor.  Though the actor that he chose portrayed him  well (I won't reveal the actor, I don't want to spoil the ending), he  should have taken into account any preconceived notions theaudience would  have about the actor before choosing them for the part.  I saw the audience  collectively shake its head and say \\"Why?\\" when we found out who God was.   As I have previously mentioned, the story was well written and all of the  actors did a commendable job on their characters, but one thing still  struck me as incongruous with the rest of the film.  Though all of the  religious jokes were in good taste and did have a valid point, one of the  comic relief characters, Jay, seemed to bring his character to such a  vulgar level that it ruined some moments.  I understand that some things  need to be done to prove a point, but there were times when I felt that his  character crossed the line of good taste.  In all, one must see this  movie how it was intended, as a work of fiction.  Though it caused  controversy, that argument got people thinking about their faith, and that  was the point of the movie.  If it is approached with an open mind, this  movie poses many questions and valid suggestions that can leave one feeling  a bit renewed about their faith.  And if not, at least you heard the F-word  a few dozen times.
B000000OE7|5.0|AT FIRST I WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS ALBUM, BECAUSE THE MORBIDITY OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS ALMOST SUFFOCATING.  BUT GRADUALLY, THE ALBUM SEEPS INTO YOUR PSYCHE LIKE CAMPHOR TO THE SKIN.  I NOW LOVE IT, AND ALMOST  ALWAYS PLAY IT STRAIGHT THROUGH WITHOUT SKIPPING A TRACK. THIS IS SOME OF  THE MOST SERENE MUSIC EVER MADE BY A ROCK BAND.<br />AND HEY GUYS, I LOVE  TRACK 13!  I THINK IT EMBODIES FREDDIES NOW DEPARTED SPIRIT, BUT WHAT DO I  KNOW?  A VERY APPROPRIATE SEND-OFF TO ROCKS' GREATEST FRONTMAN.  WE MISS  HIM.
6305609691|5.0|Excellent picture and sound, with great extras. Buyers should be aware that altough descibed as 2.35 - the transfer is only about 2.1 (but still anamorphic). Dont let it put you off.
B000000OA6|5.0|I TREMBLE AS I TRY TO FIND THE WORDS TO RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM, BUT I ALWAYS JUST FIND MYSELF STUNNED IN AWE OF THIS ENORMOUS WORK OF ART.  THE TITLE TRACK USURPS BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY AS THE BAND'S ALL-TIME SIGNATURE PIECE.   JUST AN AMAZING SONG TO LISTEN TO.<br />LIKE MOST ARTISTS THROUGH THE  CENTURIES, THE TRUE INNOVATORS WERE NOT GIVEN CREDIT BY THE CRITICS OF  THEIR DAY, AND QUEEN IS NO EXCEPTION.  THIS IS A WIDE-SCREEN CINEMASCOPE  ALBUM AND THE FICKLE NEED NOT APPLY.  IN MANY WAYS, THIS IS QUEEN'S MOST  IMPRESSIVE STATEMENT, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING WHAT FREDDIE WAS GOING THROUGH  AT THE TIME. HIS PERFORMANCE WAS NOTHING LESS THAN SUPERHUMAN!<br />THIS IS A  TIMELESS, UNMOVABLE ROCK RECORDING THAT IS TRAGICALLY OVERLOOKED BY SO MANY  PEOPLE.<br />I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION, WHY WASN'T 'RIDE THE WILD WIND'  RELEASED AS A SINGLE.  IT HAD ALL THE MAKINGS OF A WORLWIDE #1 SMASH.  AN  ALBUM THAT IS DEAR TO ALL QUEEN FANS' HEARTS.
B000002GGU|5.0|In most artist's career you are lucky to get that one album that defines what they are all about.  The one album that will always be remembered even after all his or her albums fade away. This is that album for Bryan Adams.  It was his time in the sun.  The days of MTV playing him every two minutes  and pop radio playing hit after hit from this album.  He was on top of the  rock/pop world with this album.  A great blend of rock,pop,soul and great  writing.

0553278223|1.0|i read this book with some classmates last year.  i am now a sophmore in high school.  this book was in the teens section, under fantasy.  i found this book very very dull, and difficult to access.  i have a somewhat  higher reading ability than most of the students in my class.  i think that  for a younger adult (18-22) or so, this might be appreciated (MIGHT) but as  a teen, i found this book very uninteresting.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|When the Pawn... is an utterly breathtaking follow-up to Tidal. I loved Tidal, as others have said, it's mature beyond Fiona's years at that time. I cannot stress enough that if you appreciate moody music and lyrics to fit  most any person's feelings before, during and after a relationship, then  this is the cd for you.<br />Even if you appreciate excellent lyrics as a  whole. Case in point:<br />... and then the dove of hope began it's downward  slope and I believed for a moment  that my chances were approaching to be  grabbed,  but as it came down near so did a weary tear I thought it was a  bird  but it was just a paper bag<br />Have you been there or what?  That's  from Paper Bag and let me tell you, it's just the tip of the iceberg.<br />Buy  it, own it, love it.
B00002DEMV|5.0|Nightwish defies all that is customary of neo-gothic rock.  Combining heavy riffs and hollow sounds of female operatic vocals, makes for the best in gothic/heavy metal.  Anyone who follows the goth/metal scene will  appreciate, if not love, Nightwish.  Blessed be.
B00003CWTH|2.0|Well, I'm not a film aficionado. Nor am I an artiste. So . . . in the opinion of a philistine, this flick is a bit weird, rather confusing and often boring. And too long. On the positivie side, there is some good  character creation: I particularly liked the work of Robards, Macy and  Cruise. There IS some really nice camera work. And there are a few riveting  scenes. But there are also scenes that played like nails on the blackboard  -- particularly the scenes between the cop and the drug addict.  Fortunately, I saw this at the dollar movie house so I didn't lose much  money on it.
B000002GY9|5.0|I have been in love with this album since I first bought it, about six years ago. This ranks right up there with Heart of Saturday Night, Raindogs, and even Mule Variations. One of the the many greats, perfection  once again.
6304913176|1.0|Bad. Hated it. Hated it. Really hated it. If it had been done with deft humor, it could have been really funny (maybe), but the film takes itself so seriously that it isn't even laughable as a campy B movie such as Plan  9. The big &quot;smart bug&quot;, the pseudo-science, the psychobabble/esp  stuff is just too barfy. The WWII movie bootcamp and combat scenes come  across not as campy nor as &quot;making a social statement&quot;, but as  just plain corny at best or &quot;gag me with a spoon&quot; at worst. This  is, I believe, the worst movie I've ever seen. Doesn't deserve even one  star.
B00004SCX6|4.0|1)Oops...I Did it Again- Solid track, it looses some of its power though because its so similar to  Baby One More Time. 9/10  2) Stronger-AWESOME!  Really in your face and energetic! Has single written all over it! 10/10   3) Don't Go Knockin on My Door-The R&amp;B woven into the track adds A LOT  of attitude! Very cool! 9/10  4) Satisfaction-I personanlly think its a  solid cover. For a pop version of the song its VERY well done! 8/10  5)  Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know- BEAUTIFUL!  It comes off a little hokey  at first but once the chorus rolls in... AMAZING! 10/10  6) What U See Is  What U Get-Like Oops it's a solid track but it sounds too similar to BOMT.  8/10  7) Lucky- ADORABLE SONG!  Very catchy and very cute. Another good  choice for a single. 10/10  8) One Kiss From You- Cute, sounds like  something off of her first album. Not the best track but its  nice. 7/10   9) Where Are You Now- Some people don't like this song as much but I find  it breath-taking! This proves that she can sing. True she ain't no Mariah  or Whitney but her voice is nice. 9.5/10  10) Can't Make You Love Me- A  LOTTA FUN!  Really fast and upbeat, it'll have you dancing in NO TIME!   9/10  11)When Your Eyes Say It-Hmmm...The talking in the song takes away a  lot. This song would have been AMAZING if she sang the talking parts  instead. Still very pretty though. 8/10  12) Dear Diary- You can tell she  wrote it. Very cutesy and girlish. While not an AMAZING track its cute, and  a good first try at writing. 7/10<br />All in all Oops...I Did It Again is  great pop! While it isn't gonna change the world or anything, it's  definetly a great CD to listen to when you want to forget your problems and  have fun. I recommend it highly, especially to pop fans.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|Well, my brother recently acquired this cd.  I didn't ever think of listening to it, and never thought I actually knew(or liked)any of the songs on the cd.  Last night I was on the computer and I popped it in for  lack of anything better. I was so surprised, I knew at least 3 of the songs  on the cd. One of them was &quot;Crash and Burn.&quot;  I love this song,  it had been in my head for so long and I was beginning to think I would  never hear it on the radio again.  I wasn't sure who the artist was but  what a wonderful surprise it was to hear it on this cd.  I have been  listening to it ever since, this has become my theme song.  I only gave it  4 stars because of the fact that there weren't really any other songs on  the disc that I was interested in besides the ones I already knew.  But if  you relate to &quot;Crash and Burn,&quot; or you just need something  soothing and something that you can really get into and feel the music of  at the same time-i recommend this cd very strongly. Put the song on repeat  like I did :)
6304806426|4.0|Although I don't agree with it myself, I can see why some may say that this film is very arty and in places dull. But I absolutely love this film and while it is a popular opinion amongst my friends that they disliked  Kristen Scott Thomas's Katharine Clifton I thought both the character and  the actress were terrific.<br />The Second World War is almost over but there  are hard times both in the past and present for the four occupants of a  deserted Italian fortress. The story centres on the dying patient who seems  to have forgotten his identity. Nursed by Hana, an army Canadian nurse  (Juliette Binoche, he eventually remembers how he came to be so badly  injured and a tragic, passionate love story begins to unfold as he recalls  his affair with Katharine Clifton, the wife of one of his  friends.<br />Although I suppose Thomas's and Ralph Fiennes's characters are  at the centre of the theme, I like the various sub-plot which are given and  treated in just as assidious and tender a way as the main storyline  itself.<br />Rich with truth fine acting and tenderness this film is also set  against the beautiful backdrops of pre-war Egypt and post-war  Italy.<br />Beautiful, sensual stuff. Thouroughly recommend it.
6303430570|5.0|If you're in the mood for a &quot;Hollywood&quot; movie with larger than life stars, action, and plotting, do not watch this film.  If you're ready to just plain laugh at funny, everyday people in everyday situtations,  watch this movie!<br />It's like a more bold, daring, and vulgar episode of  Seinfeld.  Character based, about &quot;nothing&quot; (well, a day in the  life of two store clerks, with some subplots mixed in - that's about it),  quirky and funny dialogue . . .<br />The situations and thoughts the the  characters go through are really like those that go through everybody's  mind when they're young, and have a job with low pay, bad hours, uncaring  supervisors, and annoying customers.  A series of silly encounters with  customers in between the sub-plots (some affecting the subplots directly)  are a blast.  We've all been where these guys are . . .dealing with  annoying customers!  <br />If easily offended, it's not for you . . .some  pretty vulgar conversations, but again, typical to young men.  <br />I  normally don't like films with little plot, but this one kept my attention  throughout . . .five stars!
B00002DEIX|4.0|A previous reviewer from San Fran wrote... &quot;Many of the cuts on this CD are quite the opposite of &quot;smooth&quot;, and in fact are harsh and cold ! In fact this is one of the few CD's I've bought in the last ten  years that I would like to return.....&quot; <br />If this person wants smooth  jazz he should buy Kenny G (and I don't mean Kenny Garrett). Joshua Redman  is the best saxman of his generation and this first album of original  compositions is a an important step towards claiming his legacy. It is not  great like Giant Steps or Kind of Blue but it is great as jazz recordings  of the past five years go and more importantly it marks the true beginning  of Redman's ascent. One day, when Redman has composed and recorded his Kind  of Blue, we will be able to look back at this recording and realize that  some of us knew it was just a matter of time.

B00000JCB2|5.0|I have had this CD for over a year now.  I bought it because of &quot;Nookie&quot;, but there is much more to the album than that.  In listening to this CD you hear one album not a bunch of singles.  Limp mixes  up an array of sounds, beats and melodies.  Guests such as Scott Weiland,  Method Man, and Jonathan Davis add interest.  Be sure to pick this album  up!

Big Steve has a way for us to remember your childhood fears, and make you  shiver as an adult. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book.

B000002UAU|3.0|This album is good as a pop album, but it's just that. It's way too flashy and because none of the stuff they had on there (circus/indian/english ballroom/soap opera type music) is not authentic, the album does not hold  up over the years. I got it when I was about 13 or 14, enjoyed it for about  a year, then grew out of it and haven't touched it since...<br />JJ
B000002UVX|5.0|Modern culture reveres the memory and influences of music heroes  much as people in the nineteenth century revered the explorers of the American frontier. We've seen numerous docu-dramas about such rock legends as the  Beatles, Jim Morrison, Buddy Holly, and Richie Valens, but when it comes to  Jimi Hendrix, his legacy is not related as a Beatle-esque rock and roll  fairy tale, but rather it parallels the impact of his recordings in their  time. Whereas his album Electric Ladyland hit the top of the charts, few of  his singles broke into the top ten. Similarly, while few people these days  can name any Hendrix tunes other than the ragged oldies-radio standards  Foxey Lady, The Wind Cries Mary, and Hey Joe (two of which were covers),  his influence is felt in virtually all rock bands that followed him and,  incredibly, in most current country bands as well.<br />If you have never  heard much more than these career-starting ditties, if you are a serious  fan of rock, or if you are one of the thousands of cocky young guitar  slingers out there in need of a moment of awe, the album for you is  Hendrix' live album, Band of Gypsys.<br />Formed in the early spring of 1969,  the Band of Gypsies was made up of Jimi Hendrix, drummer Buddy Miles  (formerly of Electric Flag) and Hendrix' old paratrooper buddy, bassist  Billy Cox. The band only lasted for six months and released only one album,  but that album is one of the few in history that has inspired the faithful  to purchase it again and again in every iteration, from vinyl, to eight  track, to cassette, to  CD. Whatever the next media may be, if there is a  God in rock heaven, it will also see a release of Band of Gypsys.<br />Drawn  from a series of four performances at the legendary Fillmore East on  December 31, 1969 and January 1, 1970, this album is characterized by  soaring guitar solos of effusive richness, and an energy both free-flowing  and relaxed, providing one of those listening experiences that makes you  want to turn off the lights, put on the headphones and unfurl your  imagination.<br /> Produced with the intention to satisfy a five-year old  contractual obligation, the set was not made up of familiar hits, but of  entirely new material, including a couple of numbers written by Buddy  Miles. Every song is an experience unto itself but the real gem of the  album is the amazing Machine Gun, a lengthy jam dedicated to &quot;...all  the soldiers fighting in Chicago...Milwaukee....New York...and, oh yes,  all  the soldiers fighting in Viet Nam.&quot; If you consider Hendrix' Woodstock  rendition of the Star Spangled Banner to be a true demonstration of the  mastery of guitar pyrotechnics, Machine Gun will show you a whole new  world.<br />If there is a weakness in this album, it would be is Buddy Miles'  vocal improvisations, which occasionally verge on being precocious. Be that  as it may,  if Hendrix were to have only released one album in his  lifetime, Band of Gypsies would have by it self won him his place in the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<br />There is one other distinction worth  mentioning here, and that is the fact that no other artist I can think of  has had so many different albums released after his death. He recorded so  much material during his brief career that practically every outtake and  dog-end has made a run at the consumer's dollar. This has been a mixed  blessing. Even now, some thirty years after Hendrix' death, new albums  continue to appear, the most recent assortment being from his  other-than-immediate family under the banner &quot;Experience  Hendrix&quot;. Although a few selections among these are worthy of note,  the consumer should be very careful not to confuse their competing MCA  double album, Band of Gypsys Live at the Fillmore East, with the object of  this review, the current pressing of the original Capitol Records  release.<br />While the recent MCA release contains live versions of a number  of songs that first appeared on earlier albums,  the content of  &quot;Gypsys Live&quot; was all rejected by Hendrix in favor of the  versions that appeared on the original Gypsys album. In short, if you are a  true died- in-the-wool Hendrix fan, buy both albums, but if you want the  best of the best, go with the real thing, Band of Gypsys.

B00003CWN3|2.0|... and not because of the tragedy depicted.  This film stirred nothing but fear in my heart.  By the end of the dizzying experience that was 'Boys Don't Cry' - I could only wonder how the Academy found any part of it  worthy of an Oscar.<br />Though Hillary Swank is convincing as Brandon/Teena,  the circustances of the character are all too pathetic to make a true  connection.<br />It seems everyone behind this film had an &quot;agenda&quot;  with the American public.  &quot;Hate is alive and well in America&quot;...  hmmm, I guess we didn't know that.  What is even worse is that it fails to  deliver the message by focusing on the jealous rage of Tom over the  relationship between Brandon/Teena and Lana.  This film left me feeling  abandoned and cold.
0783228317|5.0|Although this extremely funny and surreal film was not exactly what you'd describe as either a commercial or critical hit on its release, with several reviewers comparing it to Hunter S. Thompson's book (from which it  was adapted) and deciding it was awful, many people (myself included, as  you can see by the five stars above this review) would describe it as a  classic chunk of modern cinema.<br />Wisely keeping faithful to the masterful  novel, the film cut-and-pastes several pieces of it for Johnny Depp's  voice-over, most memorably in the opening scene, in which he and Benicio  DelToro cruise down a desert highway in a red convertible. Altogether now:  &quot;We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the  drugs began to take hold ...&quot;<br />Like many of the best films (such as  Withnail &amp; I, Funny Games and Trainspotting), the plot is minimal: a  sports journalist and his overweight, Samoan attorney go to Las Vegas to  report on an off-road race and take copious amounts of drugs. That's it -  but who said movies need even a half-decent plot to be great? Fear &amp;  Loathing does just fine, mainly due to the hilarious script - but let's not  forget Depp and DelToro's incredible potrayals of the fiendishly lovable  (or should that be lovably fiendish?) pair, and massive credit is of course  due to director Terry Gilliam for taking an &quot;unfilmable&quot; book and  making an amazing picture. If there is any justice in the world, people  will take another look at this fantastic, drug-addled nightmare and decide  that it wasn't actually so bad after all.<br />But it's still not as good as  the book ...
B000001Y42|5.0|I dont like rap very much at all so the first time I heard limp Bizkit I didn't like them.  Eventualy I grew to like them.  This album is so good because they have successfully blended rap and metal and it sounds great.   unfortunatly they have focused more on rap in there new album.  The three  best songs are Pollution, Counterfit, and stuck.  This CD is not nearly as  good as any of KoRn's albums but still great.
B00003CX5A|2.0|This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Thereis also a great soundtrack, fabulous cast and everyone performs justfine. But I wonder if the fans of this film honestly cared about the villain's plot revelations at the end. I doubt it. The 'plot' was an ill-fitting suit put on in a hurry and Tim Burton obviously had no interest in anything but the visuals (and his mate Johnny). Well, if that's all you want out of a film, then Sleepy Hollow is for you. It's pretty, atmospheric has nice music and some excellent gore action. And that's about all it has. Not to say the film isn't an achievement - it is, but in terms of narrative it is heavily flawed. Decide for yourself if narrative is important. I would rate this alongside Deep Blue Sea or Godzilla, both of which I have in my collection and both of which are fun/shallow diversions. While Sleepy Hollow is more artistic than Godzilla, Godzilla isn't trying to be anything but a big budget rollercoaster and in that it succeeds. I guess Tim Burton has succeeded too, in creating an extremely beautiful distraction. But I would not kid myself that it is anything more than that. It is a slick, visually splendid, highly stylised work of art with a forgettable plot thrown in at the end. I wish it hadn't disguised itself as something more substantial - I might have enjoyed it more. As it is, it was slow (losing more pace towards the end) and all the suggestions of depth turned out to be space-filling red herrings. I feel cheated. And I'm offended that Tim Burton felt he could throw in that lengthy chunk of exposition at the end without us noticing.
B00003CX59|4.0|Excellent portrayal of colonial America and the story we all loved as children.  Not too gory, but certainly not for little kids.  Johnny Depp is good as an overconfident criminalist who is frequently forced to retreat.  Loved every minute of this one and not so bad I had nightmares.  Entertaining.
0684833395|5.0|In becoming the 310th person to review this book here I understand the unlikelihood that I will say anything that has not been said before. I write this however because all that can be said about this book deserves to  be said and is worth saying again and again and again. &quot;Catch-22&quot;  is a monumental creation, the product of a brilliant inspiration that does  not recognize itself and such and thus plays things out on its own terms,  without pandering or pretention. I believe that this book came about simply  because Joseph Heller had a unique vision and chose to record it. It just  so happens that what was unique about Heller's vision was his ability to  view the true madness of the world and then distill that madness into  images and words, recording his viewpoint with shocking clarity.<br />I will  not deny that the presentation is ludicrously over the top. What I will  argue is that this book could have been written in no other way. Heller saw  the world in general, and war in particular, as irredeemably absurd. To be  honest then Heller had to paint an absurd picture, and make sure that it  could not be mistaken for anything but absurdity. It follows that the  presentation should be equally absurd. This is only one way in which which  Heller give the finger to conventional literary wisdom.  &quot;Catch-22&quot; was written to defy socio-political conventions and it  would be hypocritical to adhere with any closeness to conventions of the  arena in which he chose to make his stand.<br />Two common criticisms of  &quot;Catch-22&quot; are that it lacks a strong plotline and that it is too  long. The first criticism is perfectly legitimate. &quot;Catch-22&quot; not  only lacks a &quot;strong&quot; plotline, it comes very close to lacking  anything that could be considered a plot line at all. Why, I ask, should  Heller have sacrificed his ideas and vision for the luxury of a fabricated  plotline? One of the major themes of &quot;Catch-22&quot; is the  pointlessness and circularity of war, indeed, of life in general. It is  only one more example of the integrity with which &quot;Catch-22&quot; was  written that Heller chose to structure the novel in a way that would  reinforce the that theme. Who needs a plot, anyway, when the theme is so  strongly evident and so soundly delivered. As for the length, I don't think  heller could have encapsulated the enormous scope of this book in any  smaller framework. Once one gets into &quot;Catch-22&quot; it becomes an  intoxicating, encompassing, and overwhelmingly enjoyable reading  experience. Dealing with the length of the book is not a problem when it is  enjoyed as thoroughly as I enjoyed it. It also allows for repeated  readings, as one can crack it open at almost any point and read on  indefinately, find fresh enjoyment and enlightenment in each page.  &quot;Catch-22&quot; was brilliantly concieved and delivered and will be  just as convincing hundreds of years from now as it is now.
B00004T37H|5.0|this is my all time favorite movie, once and a while a film touches your heart with such beauty and elegance that only silent emotions are evoked, mononoke is one of these films
B00004SCX6|5.0|Yes, Britney does it again. I believe that this album is better than her first for two main reasons. 1. It's much more mature in the lyrics and 2. It's alot more edgier in the music. This is most obvious in tracks like  &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Don't Go Knockin' on My Door&quot;, and  &quot;Satisfaction.&quot; Personal tracks include &quot;Stronger&quot;,  &quot;What U See&quot;, and &quot;Lucky.&quot; These songs have strong  messages that definitely spoke to me when I was going through some hard  times in my life. I believe the single best track on this is &quot;Don't  Let Me Be the Last To Know.&quot; This one was produced by Mutt Lange and  Shaniah Twain. It's a great ballad with an Oriental feel to it. This one's  sure to become a big hit. In the song &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;,  Britney really shows the strong parts in her voice. It gave me chills when  I heard her start up the third chorus. It blew me away. I didn't think  Britney had it in her! I can also give credit to Britney for actually  co-writing one of the songs which is &quot;Dear Diary.&quot; It's a nice  first attempt. She'll get better in time. Most of the songs on here are  up-tempo. There are only four ballads. On her last album there were five. I  think she's gearing towards the up-tempo audience now. But also leaving  something for those ballad lovers. All of the songs on the album are  excellent and very catchy. I guarantee they'll all get stuck in your head  in like only a day. I believe this album shows that Britney has staying  power. I mean look at Madonna. What did people think of her when she first  came out? They thought she would just fade away after &quot;Like a  Virgin&quot; died out, and look at her now! I think this will be the case  with Britney. This album is a more grown up attempt for Britney which  everyone appreciates. This album is much different from her first. I  promise you you'll like it. So buy it!

B000002P48|5.0|I think that this album is one of the best albums ever! (that is a statement not just in my opinion) The highlights of the album is Free Bird, which is how a lot of you know is one of the greatest songs ever. Also  Tuesdays Gone was also a rather popular song. And Simple Man is just  beatiful, really it is amazing. Gimme Three Steps is just one of those  songs you have to sing along to, along with I Ain't The One. This album is  truly perfect and will remain in your stereo, discman, walkman, radio Etc.  forever!
B0000025ZK|3.0|The production of this, Gilmour's second solo effort, has not dated well. It has a decidedly 80's sound that in the 21st century ends up detracting from one's enjoyment of the music. In spite of this there are three cuts in  particular that stand up well. Murder, Out of the Blue and Near The End.  These are the ballads, the uptempo &quot;rockers&quot; are the one's that  were ill-served by Bob Ezrin's heavy handed production efforts.  Townshend  co-writes two tunes one of which, All Lovers Are Deranged, is quite good.  Townshend and Steve Winwood sit in on the sessions but their usually unique  styles are lost in the mix.  Stick with Gilmour's debut solo effort it's  much more rewarding and holds up well over time...Simon
0440404835|5.0|I was introduced to Paddington as a young age, and I voraciously read every book I could find. The situations Paddington got himself into were so hysterically funny that I would have to put the book down even the third or  fourth time I read them. I am eager to see if the magic is still there  reading them as an adult.
B0000033WC|5.0|One correction to the official review above: Mo Tucker did NOT play on &quot;Loaded,&quot; though she's credited. It was Billy Yule, same as on &quot;Max's.&quot; Reed wasn't happy with the post-production, but it's  still a great album, made better by the new  inclusion of  &quot;Ocean,&quot; one of the greatest and most underrated Velvet tunes.  Reed has had the interesting moment here and there in his solo career, but  the VU is fundamental to his resume.
0790729628|2.0|At the risk of receiving hundreds of threatening e-mails, I will go on record stating that Ridley Scott's dystopian vision stands as one of the most unjustifiably praised films since the invention of sound. While  technically marvelous and full of visual invention (it does use noir  influences effectively), the story drags on endlessly and the characters,  especially Ford's, remain aloof, uninteresting, and frustrating. As an  exercise in style, it has undoubted appeal, but it must be heavily  criticized at the screenplay level. When a story is in service to the  visuals, it reflects a lack of confidence at the narrative level. I have  never found Ford to be an appealing actor (he is far too bland to be a  commanding leading man), but at no other time has his character been so  devoid of passion or insight.
B00004RFFS|4.0|I haven't cared very much for Anne Rice's recent books, but her earlier work was outstanding. I loved &quot;Interview&quot; in particular, so I was really looking forward to this movie. There is always a risk in adapting  such a vivid and powerful-not to mention beloved-book into a film. Director  Neil Jordan and his collaborators have succeeded marvelously, though. This  is an exciting, engaging film; remarkably faithful to Rice's original text.  <br />The story opens in present day San Francisco. Louis (Brad Pitt), a 200  year-old vampire, is telling his life story to an interviewer (Christian  Slater), who is shocked by his supernatural revelation. &quot;I am flesh  and blood,&quot; Louis tells him, &quot;but not human.&quot;<br />His story  takes us back to late 18th century New Orleans where Louis first  encountered the Vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise). Desiring a companion, and in  love with his beautiful looks, Lestat gives Louis the &quot;Dark  Gift&quot;-that is, he makes him into a vampire. They live together for  many years, roaming the streets at night, united by their common quest for  blood.<br />Eventually, though, Lestat fears that Louis is going to leave him.  Desperate, he makes a vampire of Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a beautiful young  child, knowing the Louis would never leave the girl. Thus they are bonded  together as &quot;one big, happy family.&quot; As it turns out, though,  they are not so happy after all.<br />The story takes the vampires to Paris,  where they finally encounter some more of their own kind. The coven of  vampires is led by the stunningly handsome Armand (Antonio Banderas) who  quickly falls in love with Louis. Louis is enamored of him as well, but he  will never leave little Claudia, something Armand realizes.<br />The film ends  back in the present in a departure from Rice's book. The new twist is  exciting, though, and sets up the story for an inevitable sequel. It hasn't  been made yet, but if it ever is, I'm looking forward toit.<br />The big  question, of course, is, how is Tom Cruise as Lestat? In one word:  brilliant. This is one of his best performances ever, heightened by the  fact that he is playing a role so different from his typical screen  persona. Cruise has always been an underrated actor, but hopefully that  will start to change after people see him here. He is terrific.<br />The rest  of the performances are also quite good. Brad Pitt does very well as the  tortured, guilt-ridden Louis. Antonio Banderas is extraordinary as the  seductive, young master of darkness. His is the most convincing portrayal  of a vampire, filled with power and charisma.<br />Neil Jordan's direction is  top-notch. Visually, &quot;Vampire&quot; is stunning, helped considerably  by Dante Ferretti's superb production design. Anyone who has read the  book-and anyone who has not-is sure to enjoy this haunting, erotic treat.
0792843584|2.0|Those interested in reading more about it, I have found 2 hard-to-get books covering the making of the film:<br />(1) Final Cut by Steven Bach in which the author, a studio exec who was later fired (or quit) details the  whole bloody mess.<br />(2) Hollywood Hall of Shame by Harry and Michael  Medved. The HG chapter in this book is fast, funny and unfortunately very  accurate (although they reserve their biggest massacre for  &quot;Inchon.&quot;)<br />Anyway, the movie wasn't awful, but it did take  quite a long time to tell a rather simple story. The performances were  fine...but no one actor really delivers the knock-out character an audience  needs to care about.
B00000ILBK|5.0|&quot;Generations&quot; was awful, and existed (as a horribly plotted movie) to kill off Kirk.  &quot;First Contact&quot; was good, but it wasn't *great*.  When I saw &quot;Insurrection&quot; at the theatre, I finally  felt that Star Trek had come home.  Gene would be proud of this movie,  finally back on track.  I will avoid Trek politics, but Insurrection  finally gets back to Gene's vision and not Berman's...  I bought the DVD as  soon as I could; it's now a part of my growing collection, never to be  removed...
6305265488|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I think it was very interesting.  If you like Cinderella than you will love this movie.
B000002GBJ|2.0|There is no questioning Rick Wakeman's technical skill or importance as a progressive rock instrumentalist.  However, this is what you end up with when your technique is more important than your creativity: dull, rambling,  dated, unmelodic organ runs and cheesy &quot;classical&quot; piano  instrumentals.  If you're still someone who thinks &quot;Fragile&quot; is  the greatest album of all time, then this is for you.  If you have any  taste in music, avoid this at all costs.
B00000IKSC|1.0|I was forced to watch this by my BSB-doting little sister, and my poor brain hasn't been the same since. Never before in my life have I experienced such television as this. The Boys' psychotic 'dance' moves and their baby girl genuine good looks made me want to give  them a good slapping. Beware of this video if you have a weak stomach.
0792841344|5.0|Phantasm, which has gained a loyal and rocksteady cult following of &quot;Phans&quot; over its long span in film history, can only be described in a few words: the one true surreal nightmare. Guaranteed that anyone who  has not seen this film previously will be confused but certainly not  disappointed. Confusion is what this Phanflick runs on and its pure,  unadulterated fun. You will be compelled by the mysterious happenings  (which range from yellow blood to dwarf beings and gruesome killing spheres  to the legendarily eerie Tall Man. You will find yourself viewing this  masterful artwork over and over, discovering a new possibilty and aspect  each time you do so that helps you make a spectacular puzzle out of the  films very intentional incoherence.      For those of you out there that  are now as confused by my review as you will by this astounding flick,  don't worry explanations follow. Coscarelli's film centers around a  malicious tall man, a mortician no less, that has come to town. In his wake  he leaves the dead risen from the grave anew in the form of strange short  creatures. But to protect his secret from the intrusions of a boy who has  seen too much he has killer sphere's that are as deadly as they are  strange. The boy is relentless though and further ventures into the Tall  Man's world, dragging his brother and their friend, Reggie, into the mix.  The result? a strange film that you are not bound to forget in a long time.  And what is most perplexing is the realization that it may all be illusion.  This film is followed by three sequels, each of which clarifies the story  even more for the Phantasm-hungry viewers.  This dvd presentation of  Phantasm is the best i have seen in a long time, the picture is crisp, the  sound is in full theater pounding glory and it is packed with so many  features that can only feed our hunger for more knowledge on the making of  such a massive achievement. Definately a sure addition (along with its  sequels, which areonly available on video, with the exception of part  four) to your collection. Buy it and revel in its glory.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the album that totally changed my world, and got me to appreciate music for more than simply the hit songs that you hear on the radio. It's dramatic scope, semi-conceptualistic format and intensely fragmented and  personal lyrics make this a work unlike almost all others released in the  90's. The album as a whole is grandly beautiful. Let Down- Paranoid  Android- Lucky- the album is just packed with incredibly emotional songs.  In conclusion, this is one of the greatest albums ever released, and to say  that it is a must hear is an understatement.
B000002L7Y|5.0|I just want to tell all of you who haven't bought or listened to this cd that you're missing out on a classic. I love all the songs in this album. It brings back good memories as a kid. I could listen to it over and over  again. It doesn't matter how many years pass by because the songs are  excellent. My favorite songs are The Blue Sky, Hunting High and Low, The  Sun always shines on tv. Don't miss out on this great album. I hardly ever  listen to 80's music but this one doesn't escape from playing on my cd  player.
B00003CWPR|5.0|this is a great film.  view it more than once.  like spielberg said, kubrick's films grow on you.  the special features/interviews are worth the purchase of the DVD.
B00004U30D|5.0|this movie is breathtaking right down to the last second. you laugh, you cry, you think all within the first hour of this film!  I recommend it to anyone who loves good movies. WARNING: THIS FILM IS NOT FOR YOUNG ONES.
0783240287|5.0|I was about to return it at first thinking I didn't really get the widescreen version.  Then I found out that this is 1:1.55 widescreen... meaning there are no bars at the top and bottom since 1:1.55 is the size of  a normal television.  So yes, it is widescreen in that it wasn't made wide  and shortened, but it's not widescreen in that there is not and never was  anything wide about it.
0783239408|5.0|The only way to sum up this movie is to say that it is without a doubt, a masterpiece! This film deserves 10 stars! No questions asked, this movie will be on AFI's list of the best movies in the future. It has everything  that a great movie needs, an incredible script, great direction, and a cast  that together, made a movie that shows the trials and tribulations of the  typical american family. Don't listen to those who say this movie is about  a pervert, see for yourself how much beauty there is in so many things. And  remember, it won Oscars for a reason!
158234082X|1.0|A self aggrandizing celibration of dysfunctional personal and workplace behavior with little to say about kitchens or cooking and alot to say about the authors supposed coolness. This book is truly a waste of time.
6305807086|1.0|This is possibly one of the most overrated films I have ever seen.<br />I feel complete indifference to all the characters. The plot is a meandering shambles and the best thing in it is Charlie Sheen! How bad must a movie be  if Charlie Sheen is the best thing in it!<br />I can't even see the point it's  trying to make. Is it a satire on the nature of celebrity or a surreal  sci-fi movie?<br />Either way it fails. If you want to track down surreal try  Terry Gilliam. In fact the whole film would have worked much better as  Gilliam/Python animation than a live action movie.<br />If you want a satire  on celebrity try DeNiro's 'King of Comedy.'<br />On a final note the whole  movie just looks terrible! The lighting is awful and I think I even saw a  boom shadow in one shot.<br />For old hippies and stupid people who think  they're clever only.
B000002U82|5.0|This was the first Floyd album I heard and it blew my mind. I had never heard anything so amazing before. Now I feel that while great, this album wasn't even the Floyd's best and it is slightly overrated and overplayed.  But it is still a must have for any music fan
B000031XCR|4.0|This is the first Celine Dion CD I've ever purchased...and I have to say, I've listened to it so much in the three weeks since I've bought it that my parents are about to kick me out of the house!  All of the songs are good,  some of the songs are GREAT...I did, however, disagree with how badly  chopped and edited &quot;It's All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; was on this  album...I mean, an entire verse is missing, and some really great  introductory music was cut from previous versions!  Other than that, I'd  recommend this for anyone who wants one CD with all of Celine's best stuff  on it.
B00004NRWH|5.0|This is honestly one of the best CD's I have ever bought...the lyrics are great and very well thought out, and the beat in all these songs is amazing!  All I can say is...what are you waiting for, go buy this NOW!

0790749815|5.0|Compare this first-rate romantic comedy-thriller to Hitchcock's more  &quot;serious&quot; works, and it might not seem like it amounts to  much...and maybe it doesn't.  For NORTH BY NORTHWEST was built for one  purpose and one purpose alone--to entertain.  But rarely do films entertain  so intelligently, and so economically (even at 136 minutes, there isn't an  unnecessary shot in the entire story).  Beneath the seemingly lightweight  surface bubbles the same craftsmanship, the same rigorous attention to  detail that made such acclaimed masterpieces as VERTIGO and PSYCHO.<br />The  story, featuring Cary Grant as an innocent man mistaken for a secret agent  and Eva Marie Saint as the seductive blonde with her own mysterious agenda,  is delightfully twisted, yet despite its complexity it's never confusing or  overwrought.  The script is not only perfectly paced but brilliantly witty  (Grant in particular gets the best lines).  Again, not a single shot is  wasted.  Almost every scene is memorable--the hilarious &quot;drunk  driving&quot; sequence, the très risqué dinner chat on the train, the  crop-dusting sequence, the auction, and of course, the chase across Mt.  Rushmore...all this in a magnificent package shot with Hitchcock's  trademark precision and typically warped sense of humor.<br />This is one of  those movies where every single element works just right--the dialogue, the  acting, the direction, the dazzling visuals, and Bernard Herrmann's  pitch-perfect score.  It's not one of those movies that require the viewer  to sit through hours of boredom for ten minutes of great entertainment.   Every moment of NORTH BY NORTHWEST feels like a separate payoff; every  moment entertains.  Does it have the psychological dimension and disturbing  thematic weightiness of VERTIGO and PSYCHO?  No.  But for my money, it's  the most enjoyable and satisfying movie Hitchcock ever made.
B00004T9UF|4.0|yea....eminem is pop but he still can make a nice song.i enjoyed it a lot.the only complaint is he didnt rhyme as good as he did on the slim shady lp and wasnt as funny.but still rhymed crazy!id reccomend to anyone.
B00003CWN3|1.0|I think that most accounts of real stories (including this one) are meant firstly, to be informative; secondly, to be artistic.  Indeed, everyone should learn about the hatred and violence that is directed at people with  alternative sexualities.  People who are inclined to hold such views could  certainly benefit from viewing such a film.  After seeing this movie,  anyone with blood in their veins should be able to find simpathy for people  like the main character, Teena Brandon: a lesbian who takes on a  traditional male gender. However, one must be somewhat familiar with a  story before choosing to view it in the form of a two hour film.   Furthermore, a potential viewer must also have some previous interest in  the subject matter.  It seems to me that anyone who would watch this movie  would already be understanding of the various sexualities which are  practiced today.  They are aware of, and disgusted with, crimes committed  against their participants.  I calculate that these are exactly the people  who do not need to see such a gruesome movie to understand the message it  conveys.  I found this movie extremely disturbing and certainly, the most  sad movie I have ever seen.  Without the slightest bit of ignorance, I can  say, &quot;I did *not* need to see that!&quot;
B000006IUQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie. There are a few sections that are not in the HBO version. If you you like Anthony Hopkins and the wilderness you probably will like this. However, I was disappointed that there were few  DVD features.
6305546789|5.0|Slasher films are in a unique family there is the unholy ghost of  Nightmare on Elm Street, the son Friday the 13th, and the father being  Halloween.  Halloween is the story of a child who killed his sister and was  comitted in an insane institute.  Fifteen years later he escapes and comes  home to kill.  This was the first true slasher film that gripped audiences  around the world and scarred the life out of them.  This film could have  been hailed as a cult classic had they never made any sequels as John  Carpenter intended.  This film utilizes the work of shadows, music, and  pace to scare the watcher instead of gore.  It was great to see a DVD of  the film released but i have to say i found it lacking in the exteras.  I  would have liked to see a commentary track by the cast and director to add  to the film and some extra scenes would be nice.  But do not be tured off  by these short cummings the DVD is an exelent transfer of sound and picture  and the extras they do have are quite good.  This DVD is perfect for the  die-hard fans of the film and its sequels and also for anyone that hasn't  seen it who just wants a good scare.  Forget Scream and those other  slasher/&quot;horror&quot; films they dont even compare to this masterpiece  of terror.
6301562925|5.0|This is basically what all 80's horror movies were like. I really did like this movie. Sure, it had it's very slow points, but the great kills made it worth the money. If you are a fan of the Friday The 13th movies, this one  is for you!
0380002930|5.0|I first saw the film &quot;Watership Down&quot; as a young child, and when some years later I came across, the book, I fell in love with it immediately. The story of a group of young rabbits fleeing their home  because of man's need &quot;to destroy the earth&quot; and finding a new  settlement is perhaps the most beautiful story I have ever read. It is  realistic, never silly nor sentimental but conveys the world of nature  clearly - wonderful but cruel, and too be handled carefully. The characters  of the rabbits are individual and can indeed be likened to people - Fiver  the quiet dreamer, filled with insights, Hazel the cool authoritarian  figure, Bigwig the bluff fighter, Hawthorne the somewhat tiresome, grating  irritant - all are unforgettable in this timeless classic which will last  generations. It is one of the few books which I can honestly say everyone  should rad, and those who have not are truly missing out.
0780626966|5.0|The sad part about never having money is the fact that I will never own this wonderful set from one of the best horror series ever. Every Nightmare On Elm Street movie is contained here, and believe me, they are worth the  cash!
006016848X|5.0|One of my good friends suggested this book after a very bitter breakup. This book enabled me to forgive and be able to accept that men and women are very different.  It also enabled me to go back and make amends to the  man whom I literally hated and we now enjoy a friendship. The book is funny  and light hearted.  I have gone on to learn to laugh and enjoy the  differences between men and women.  We're really a rather funny bunch of  creatures.  The concepts are communicated in an easy to understand format.   Without this book and several others I do not know that I would be willing  to take the chance again in a relationship and I am very thankful that  people like John Grey share their wisdom and humor in the format of a book.   ~$20.00 for one idea or bit of information that may change my life for the  better is worth every penny.
6305137293|5.0|The Sequel to the everlasting classic. And it does not let me down one bit! This is still one of my favorite horrors of all time and will remain that way forever. The suspense doesn't die down, even in the slow parts  that all of the Halloween movies seem to experience. The killings are  executed beautifully and the body count has risen to quite a high number.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Even if I am too young to say that title, I think the last good album was released in 1988, with &quot;Seventh son of a seventh son&quot;. The deaprture of Adrian Smith was a tough hit for them. Albums like &quot;No  prayer for the dying&quot; and &quot;Fear of the dark&quot; show a lack of  creativity. The departure of Bruce Dickinson, meant the end of an era for  them. Now that they're back (after two failed performances in  &quot;The-good-but-not enough&quot; X-Factor and the  &quot;What-the-hell-is-this&quot; Virtual XI maiden has come back... For  the long haul I hope. Brave New World has it all... Joining three quality  guitars, gives this album all the main achievement he is getting, plus the  already known playing from MR. Harris, the matured voice of Dickinson and  Nicko's best performance ever with Iron Maiden. This is not enough to beat  7th son, bu has quality. There are incredible songs...10 of them. &quot;THe  wicker mand&quot; is the typical No. 1 track. Speed and guitar riffs are  his basics. &quot;Ghost of the navigator&quot; is some stuff like  &quot;Rime of the ancient mariner&quot; but not that long. &quot;Brave new  world&quot; is a good song with a great rhytm to begin, as the song goes  on, it gain a lot  of power. &quot;Blod brothers&quot; is the lost son of  X-Factor... This song sounds like it was going to be sing by Blaze. Good.  &quot;The Mercenary&quot; is the Warsong, and it reminds me a little bit  songs like &quot;Where eagles dare&quot; and &quot;THe prisoner&quot;  Because of his rhytm. Dream of mirrors is another X-factor son...  The  fallen angel is a song that could fix in any Bruce Dickinson's previous  albums (Accident or Chemical wedding) NOmad is maybe the best song, with a  power guitar rhytm, excellent lyrics and spectacular performance by  Dickinson. It has all the powerslave or to tame a land feeling. Out of the  silent planet is the most uncommon song in the album. It is not heavy, but  has a lot of Maiden on it. The thin line... Good, butonly the guitar can  save it from being the &quot;Not good enough&quot;.<br />So, this is a new  beginning for them. And I hope is for long.<br />UP THE IRONS!
B00004SCX6|5.0|What an amazing cd! If I were to list all my favorite songs on the cd, I would be naming almost all of them. Oops is destined to be a classic, and Lucky will make a great next single. AS for all the people who trash  Britney in this section... get a life! If you really don't like pop music,  well then great! But don't go out of your way to trash Britney because you  aren't a pop fan. I don't like country music, but I wouldn't leave a bad  review for all those artists. I have better things to do. But if you are a  pop fan, this album will amaze you. So many great songs, cann't wait to see  her next video.
B000002H2Z|5.0|The review up top is right: This is the Cure album to start with.  But maybe that's because this is the one I happened to start with.  Actually, I think it's excellent because it's right at what I would call the middle of  the Cure's range of sounds.  It's still got some of their early punk  edginess, some of their 80's danciness, some of the dark goth-like tones,  and a hint of the gloss that you'll find in their more recent  albums.<br />Even though it falls in this niche, the styles of music on this  album vary widely and the lyrics are haunting as always.  This is  definitely one of my favorite albums and seems to fit a variety of moods  and settings.  I bought this album on vinyl when it first came out and have  been listening to it periodically ever since (although I've  &quot;upgraded&quot; to a CD version).  Every once in a while I forget  about it and find it dusty on my shelf.  When I clean it off and pop it  back in the player I'm always glad I did.<br />If you only know the Cure's  recent stuff, definitely go out and get this album.  If you've never heard  of the Cure and don't just want a greatist hits album, get this one.  If  you don't care...well, then nevermind...
0385474547|5.0|While collecting works concerning the nature of man, I stumbled upon Chinua Acebe's THINGS FALL APART.  This work, in one word, is a masterpiece.<br />THINGS FALL APART incorporates several elements.  First, the  setting, rural Nigeria, reveals a sense of the traditional, dynamic  cultures of this region.  One would expect that these native peoples are  simple in respect to government, economics, social customs, and savage in  religion.  However, Mr. Achebe presents the truth of these peoples.  Their  cultures are actually very complex and rival the operations of Western  Civilizations.  The author goes so far as to demonstrate Africa's   superiority over the Western habits of missionaries and colonists.  <br />The  story also operates upon another premise that every intellectual will  appreciate.  Many who claim to have resolved the question concerning the  nature of man cite examples and then make their conclusions from these  situations.  However, Chinua Achebe indirectly resolves the debate over  human nature by describing the behavior of the main character, Okonkwo,  during moments of sadness, anger, vengence, loss, and joy.  From this he  leave the reader to make their own conclusion.  Essentially, Mr. Achebe's  tale can be manipulated such that the story itself is the proof to any  astute conclusion about the nature of man that the reader  ascertains.<br />From the perspective of literary value, I can see why the  College Board often uses this work in their AP English (Literature) tests.   It is apparent that Mr. Achebe's style conveys every emotion with such  energy that it is uncommon not to understand the character's feelings.  The  writing style makes the reader comfortable while emersing himself in a  foreign situation--I doubt many people identify with a tale from Africa  before they read this book.  The book teaches a lesson: troubles to the  Queen of England are the same in magnitude and emotion as to a native of  Africa.     <br />I was merely disappointed with the multitude of characters  whose names, being foreign and difficult to pronounce, were often easy to  confuse and forget after each chapter.  This, however, does not at all  diminish the essence and message of the story.  <br />For this book to operate  on so many levels compells me to rate THINGS FALL APART as a five-star  masterpiece that is certainly an asset to literature and a window to our  own human nature.
0553296981|1.0|this book was a waste of time and the only reason i read the book waz for my 7th grade english class i read it hoping to learn about the hallacaust and life in germany but instead all it talked about waz her and peter which  i really couldnt care less about.
B00000064G|5.0|I acquired this album from a friend about 6 months before VW decided to use the title track in their Cabrio commercial. I found it amazing that almost no-one had heard of Nick Drake, prior to the VW ad that is. The cd  is 28 minutes or so, and it is purely amazing, just a wonderful way to pass  half an hour of time. Most of the songs on Pink Moon are played in  alternate tunings which account for their somewhat &quot;different&quot;  sound. The cd has a very simple and clean feel to it, likely because it is  merely Nick on acoustic guitar with occasional piano parts. So if you're  into acoustic guitar music, you should like this album. Overall I find Pink  Moon very peaceful, nice to relax to. Just sit back in your recliner, close  your eyes, and really *listen*. To me it's  mind-boggling that his music  has been overlooked for more than 25 years. It's a shame Nick didn't live  to see the success of his music.
B00000ADG2|5.0|By far, I would classify this album as my #1 all-time favorite.  It's hard to explain why.  I don't classify myself as a &quot;hip-hop&quot; fan by any stretch of the imagination.  &quot;To Zion&quot; made me weep,  literally. Ms. Hill has true talent which is rare these days.  How many of  these so called artists today actually write their own songs?  Not enough.   Bottom line, you need to experience this album for yourself.  If it doesn't  touch you, you have no soul.
B000005EJL|3.0|Well, since December of last year - that was when I wrote my first review - my opinion of this album has changed. I still do not want to unconditionally recommend this album, yet - after having listened to it  more often - it has some really good moments that I was not so much aware  of when I first reviewed it. <br />Being a long-time Supertramp fan, I felt  that &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; could not keep most of the good  old Supertramp spirit alive. I expressed this in my review of December  1999. And I still think that STNC is much more a Rick Davies solo album  with special appearances by John Helliwell and Bob Siebenberg than a new  Supertramp album. <br />The songs &quot;Get Your Act Together&quot;,  &quot;Live to Love You&quot;, and &quot;And the Light&quot; sound a bit  like softer versions of some of Rick's older Supertramp stuff, but they are  only mediocre efforts because the instrumentation is not as good as it used  to be.<br />With the songs &quot;It's a Hard World&quot;, and the title song  Rick tries to combine jazz and progressive rock and the instrumental parts  of especially the latter are really good. This is something I realized  during the last months and I think it needs to be mentioned because it was  missing in my first review. <br />&quot;You Win, I Lose&quot;, &quot;Listen to  Me Please&quot;, &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, &quot;Give Me a Chance&quot;,  and &quot;C'est What&quot; are poppier songs and only &quot;You Win, I  Lose&quot; is an innovative addition to Supertramp's song collection, but  even that song is a little too repetitive. <br />&quot;Help Me Down that  Road&quot; is blues-rock without any surprising moments, while the final  track &quot;Where There's a Will&quot; is a superfluous, superficial and  simply terribly sounding effort.<br />Summing up, the album is mediocre, but  not bad. Some progressive rock parts are good, but there are too few of  them on the album. Mark Hart cannot replace Roger Hodgson, he does not even  come close to Roger's outstanding emotional singing. Rick Davies is a good  songwriter, a great keyboard player, a decent singer, but his music is best  only combined with Roger Hodgson's wonderful singing and skilled guitar  play. That is why Supertramp today will never be the old Supertramp as long  as Roger Hodgson's uniqueness is missing in the band.

B00001NFCY|2.0|&quot;Never Die&quot;, &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; and &quot;Higher&quot; are the ONLY good songs on this CD. I can't imagine owning this CD and was glad that I only borrowed it from my cousin. Ugh!  Terrible!
0385495315|5.0|The solution of signals encrypted with the Enigma was one of the outstanding efforts by the Allies during WWII. The contributions of the Polish code breakers to this effortwere of monumental importance as were  the efforts made at Bletchley Park. Reading signals from Nazi Uboats,  microwave radar and the efforts of brave men led to success in the battle  of the North Atlantic. Moreover the concept of designing an  electromechanical mechine to recover clear text represents one of the  important early steps in the history of the development of the modern  computer. This is most clearly seen in the relationship between Colossus  and the Lorenz Gehimeschreiber. This book provides an extremely thorough  and readily understandable explaination of the operation of Egnima. For  this reason alone, I consider it extremely rewarding reading. For those who  have not previously explored any of the history of cryptography this book  provides a highly readable overview of remote and recent events as they  relate to the topic. I found it extremely informative with regard to the  function of the plug board on the Enigma. It was quite interesting to learn  that this component of the device provided the the greatest number of  possible encryption but was the second least secure aspect of its  operation. Operator error, of course, being the very least.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Great CD.  I lost interest in the band after Bruce Dickinson left and gave them a chance and bought &quot;Virtual XI&quot; but was dissapointed with that CD except for maybe 3 songs.  This CD is just what you'd expect except  maybe Bruce doesn't scream as much as he used to and that's ok.   &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; is the best song.  Actually, all the songs are  great but &quot;Brave New World&quot; &amp; &quot;Thin Line Between Love  &amp; Hate&quot; could have been better. Regardless, this CD is worth  getting.  The 3 guitar lineup doesn't stand out like I thought it would.  I  was expecting guitars all over the place-it still sounds like 2. Buy this  CD!
0517122707|5.0|This is one of the very best books I've read in a long time!  You'll especially enjoy it if you're familiar at all with New Orleans.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Hey y'all I am a 12 year old former Backstreet Boys fan, and I just gotta say that I love love love this CD!  I first heard of the Chili Peppers when I was in 2nd grade but had no idea who they were. Then in the summer  of '99, Scar Tissue was on MTV alot, and I liked the song. But this was  when I didn't listen to anything but BSB. After hearing Around the World,  Otherside, Under the Bridge, and Give it Away, I became a little bit of a  fan, then finally convinced myself to go by the CD a few weeks ago. Its the  best CD I've ever bought. All the instrumental arrangements are done really  well, and Anthony Kiedis has a really unique voice. Some of my favorite  songs are Around the World, Scar Tissue, Otherside, Californication, and I  Like Dirt. *Some come up and some come young, live to love and*.... oh  sorry. The only songs I'm not really crazy about are Porcelain and Emit  Remmus (?). They're kinda growing on me though. The reason I put OUCH!  in  the title is because I was listening to it  on my Diskman yesterday, and  some of the guitar solos make your ears hurt really bad! (I didn't have the  volume up too loud) When I was done listening, my ears felt like they were  bleeding. Yuch. Well you're probably sick of reading this so I'll let you  go now. Bye bye. Peace love and peppers
B000002JR8|5.0|I reluctantly bought &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; with a 20 dollar bill I found on the ground at the mall. Being a fan of bands like Megadeth and Anthrax, I figured Pantera was right up my ally. Afther  listening to GSTK once I knew that it was a masterpiece. That is exactly  what happened to me with &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;. From the opening  with &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot; and several other kickass songs  &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; certainly does &quot;drive&quot; with amazing  force. The highlight of the album is the agressive and violent &quot;5  Minutes Alone&quot; followed by &quot;25 Years&quot;. Although usually  Dimebag Darrel does an incredible job, I think that he is upstaged by his  brother and drummer Vinnie Paul, who plays as if he were firing a machine  gun during a war. So if you want an agressive fist pounding CD, than buy  &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;.

0440234743|3.0|I am a great fan of the works of John Grisham, so when this new book came out I immediately wanted to read it.  I went into the book expecting the high drama and suspense of Grisham's other books.  The book's beginning had  me intrigued and I read on.  There were delightful possibilities for danger  and suspense throughout the Pantanal region of Brazil.  The only ones that  the hero, Nate O'Reilly stumbled upon however were fierce storms and  tropical diseases.  Alligators, anacondas, and blood thirsty lawyers were  mentioned time and time again but never with any effect.  I expected a  chase and a race to find Rachel Lane.  But no one really seemed interested.   Nate was left to his own devices to find her in his own sweet time.  The  characters were likable and well developed but this is the novel's one and  only selling point.              Grisham had the opportunity to make this  as exciting as his past novels have been, but he fell short.  The ending  was especially disappointing.  It was higly anticlimactic and seemed rather  too convenient.  How wonderful that everything just magically fell into  place and that both the lawyers in DC and the missionary in South America  would come to exactly the same conclusion.  There were no surprises or  twists and turns.  The ending was straight forward and short.  And, I might  add, boring.  Frankly, it left me cold.  Being the hopeless romantic that I  am, I was secrectly hoping that Nate would return to the Pantanal, find  Rachel and he would stay there with her (since he longed to escape his old  life).  This seemed to be hinted at in all of Nate's longings both for a  new life and to see Rachel again.  But Grisham seems to have taken the easy  way out and provided us with an ending that neatly sums everything up in 5  pages.  Neat but boring.  Definitely not his best work.  For a good  exciting read that will make you want to keep reading until you reach the  end I suggest either The Pelican Brief or A Time to Kill,both excellent  Grisham works.
B00001PE4D|4.0|Many people concider cruel intentions to be this big trouble making hit. Unfortunatley,the only trouble i see is when i watch it at home. My mother screams at me to turn it off. I found cruel intentions to be a pretty good  film, even though the title should be changed a bit. Ryan Phillipe's  character was a little bit shy of cruel, dishonerable yes, but not cruel.  The film needed to cool it on the whole lesbian, homosexual vibe. Too many  times did we see this happen in this film. In my opinion, cruel intentions  had great actors, a nice plot and a firm grasp on teenagers in society, but  the movie could have been a little bit cleaner so it wouldnt corrupt the  minds of little children who are flipping through channels on a sunday  night.
6305531374|4.0|Halloween: H20 was the first of the Halloween's that I saw. But after seeing it, I was dead-set on seeing each and every one of them. Within a year I saw all of them. The first, of course, is classic, and tops all the  others by far. This one however adds more of a modern day spin to the  series. It was better than the rest of the sequels, but I must admit that  the trailer creeped me out more than the movie itself. The DVD itself was  great. The sound and picture were incredible. I was disappointed to find  that there was no trailer on it, and no commentary. The trivia game was  pretty cool. Overall, I would suggest this film and DVD to anybody who is a  fan of the series, or horror movies in general.

B000023X9W|4.0|...yes 39 minutes isn't long for a full priced cd, but lets not forget that a few years back old Neil released Year Of The Horse, a double live cd for the price of a single, making no profit on the release i believe.
630575067X|1.0|This movie is all that is stated above: a disgrace.  I find it offensive that someone could actually think that this piece of over-hyped, 100% special effects, worthless piece of trash could EVER come close to the  original trilogy.  There was no story, no development of plot and horrible  acting.  Character development (ESPECIALLY that of Darth Maul) was  nonexistent.  Jar-Jar was an unnecessary addition.  It seems like the whole  movie was made on a computer.  When other movies not carrying the Star Wars  name are made like this, they are laughed at.  Count me out from the people  in line to see Episode 2: The Garbage Continues.  Lucas peaked when he made  Return of the Jedi, which is in my opinion the best and only great Star  Wars movie.  I give one star for the mere fact that Lucas was brave enough  to send this piece of trash into the world.  The Star Wars saga as we know  it ended in 1982.  No SW movie will EVER come close to ROTJ.
B000002MG1|5.0|Popular concensus has it that the best REM records are the first two, perhaps three, on IRS. Common minor opinion is that the remaining albums of the IRS era are nearly as good. While the first few Warner Brothers era  albums sold better, few serious fans would argue that this era--starting  with 1990's Green--is as good.<br />And they're right. With one important  exception. That exception, as you might have guessed, is Automatic for the  People. Both Green and Out of Time, the albums that ushered in both the  '90s and REMs long-term contract with Warner Brothers were spotty affairs  (with terrific highs but way too many lows). These are basically the kinds  of albums that many worried REM would be expected/forced to make in return  for the big dollars that giant Warner Brothers paid to lure them from indie  IRS.<br />So it was a bit of a surprise when the low-key Automatic for the  People hit the shelves. Instead of Shiny Happy People Pt. II, we got a  moody delicate album that essentially used the the softer urges on the  early albums (e.g. Green Grow the Rushes) as a foundation, and merged them  with the greater lyrical directness and studio  professionalism that they'd  learned over the course of their previous three albums. Happily unlike  those previous three albums, there is almost no filler on Automatic for the  People.  The result is an album that has stood the test of time that now  stands, for many, as the BEST REM album of all.<br />Sadly, subsequent albums  have not been up to this standard. But while none of their more recent  efforts is even close to as good as Automatic for the People, neither is  any an embarrassment (are ya listening Bono?), leaving hope that at any  time Stipe and company may deliver us an album to sit as a worthy companion  to this.<br />dap
B00004SST6|5.0|When I went into HMV looking for this, I had no idea that I was getting a CD that had George at his best than previous albums.<br />This is how I like George, smooth instrumental jazz the &quot;classical&quot; way than what we  have heard from him in recent times where there was much vocals and much  more of the upbeat contemporary jazz that I prefer to hear from his  &quot;rival&quot; Norman Brown.<br />My advice, time to go out and get this  album.
0782008372|1.0|While I am a fan of the movie, I bought the DVD in the hope of owning a  quality copy of an excellent movie but was shocked by the fact that the DVD  is only slightly better than the VHS..which is truly awful.<br />I would not  recommend this DVD.

0140433627|3.0|&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a typical novel from the romantic period. The story is based on the conflict of a scientist with the results of his work. But Frankenstein is far more than that: It is the story of two individuals  (Frankenstein and his &quot;monster&quot;) and their acceptance and  behavior in society, and of course, the novel contains a lot of latent  psychological information (what would Freud have said about that?).  However, it is typical for the age of  romanticism that the feelings and  thoughts of the individuum are at the center of the plot (see e.g. the  works by Byron or by the German authors Eichendorff and Novalis). This  holds as well for the music composed during that time (Schubert, Schumann,  Chopin, ...).  Mary Shelley describes in great detail the innermost  feelings of Frankenstein and his &quot;wretch&quot; and how they changed  from one minute to the other, and what made them change their moods, and  why and how, and who was around etc. This actually - because presented  through the entire book - makes the reading of the highly interesting story  rather tedious. Story: 5 stars, Fun: 1 star

6305127646|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who distrusts critical mumbo-jumbo and found  this not very ambitious movie entertaining and appealing. To be sure, many  things could have been done better (Dr. Russell's initial exposition on  cold fusion, plausibility of the overall plot and eventual results, the way  the Saint was haunted by his past etc.), but I think the acting was really  good. Additionally, there wasn't too much blood spill and unnecessary sex  which I think rendered the film even more balanced. Sometimes expensive and  even sophisticated movies leave you empty after you've watched them; this  is a rather naive movie that might give you something.
6305949638|5.0|This is the most excellent movie ever made.  I have to say John Irving's script captured the book in it's entirety.  Michael Caine and Tobey Maguire's acting is both exquisite and masterful. The movie made me laugh,  cry, and overall give a new meaning to the word filmmaking. Excellent.
B000002OVJ|4.0|When originally released, The Who's &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; was a quick glimpse of the lads pounding out the tough guy covers and original tunes live with astounding working class conviction. Even today, to listen to  &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, &quot;Substitute&quot;, or &quot;Shakin' All  Over&quot; is akin to hearing these guys touch of the core of a Rock and  Roll super collider. In their greatest moments, The Who achieved a  chemistry during live performance that was as unique as it was astounding.  Live at Leeds in 1970 caught some of those moments for the record, and was  a nice portrait of the group before they stepped off into the Baba O'Riley  years.<br />The newly released version only improves on the original by  showing the group stretch themselves during their performances.  &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; and &quot;Tattoo&quot; respectively capture The  Who performing material that is more challenging and, well, touching, yet  every bit as rewarding as the more rocking numbers. There is no doubt that  this album gives a clearer portrait of the musical range this group  possessed, and is stronger for it.<br />Pete Townsend, who never sounded  comfortable as a lead guitar player, clearly understands the strengths of  his rhythym guitar playing here. Listen to him on &quot;Amazing  Journey/Sparks&quot;, two terribly underappreciated tunes from the rock  opera &quot;Tommy&quot;. Townsend's playing during this collage is amazing  in it's straight ahead intensity, and runs the gamut from soft and ethereal  to raucous and back. Together with Moon, Entwistle, and Daltrey, this  number creates some of the most beautiful chaos I've ever heard. In short,  Moon's playing throughout this album and on this song imparticular, is  nothing short of remarkable. <br />The flip side of this coin is found in  &quot;A Quick One (while he's away)&quot;. Without going into detail, let's  just say this mini opera is your basic high speed collision of Rock and  Roll with MontyPython. The result being a gloriously silly song punctuated  with rocking riffs. <br />I honestly don't know why they did not release this  album like this in 1970, but it's here now. It's truly one of the greatest  testaments of a live Rock and Roll performance this listener has ever  heard. Strong Buy.
0783230621|1.0|This movie was horrible!  They drive a truck through lava, and even spin the wheels in it; when they escape it, the truck is fine and so are the tires. That is almost as good as the lake of acid. The acid is eating  through the metal boat, but Pierce Brosnan can wrap his hand in  a shirt  and paddle, and his hand is perfectly fine. These are only part of the  reason I found this movie one to make fun of. It was completely rediculous.
B00004U3UG|5.0|This is the same disc as the the second disc from the 2 disc Limited Edition that was released back in November. It has the same commentary, deleted scenes (some restored some as a separate supplement), and the  alternate ending (which I guess every Army of Darkness fan has seen at this   point). If you missed out on the original 2 disc set get this one. The  commentary is worth the price alone.
0671799320|5.0|I am  a chemical engineer in the oil industry and this book intrests me for obvious reason, but... This book is about the impact oil and mankind has had on each other.  Oil has shaped the world economy and power  structure in business and goverment since it was first drilled for in Penn.  This book is more about the intrigue than technology.  The goals of this  book is to show how man hads become to depend on oil without knowing it.   How oil has shaped history, warfare and peace.  I have had several friends  who are not engineers  say that they have loved this book.  No hard science  background is needed.  Yergin is weaves a story of people and their  fasination and fixation to control the worlds supply of oil.  THE PRIZE is  the perfect title.
B00000IPAX|1.0|I have some of the other reviews for Enema of the State and I have come to a conclusion:  either punk is dead or all these younger listeners don't have a clue about punk music.  I suspect Lou Pearlman formed this group of  poseurs.  All the tracks on this album sound hollow and shallow.  If anyone  reading this review should be interested in punk, please buy the following  albums:  Black Flag &quot;Damaged&quot;, Husker Du &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;,  Dead Kennedys &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; or  &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot;, Minor Threat &quot;Complete  Anthology&quot;, Misfits &quot;Static Age&quot;, and Circle Jerks  &quot;Golden Shower of Hits&quot;.
0805062971|3.0|Fight club was a good movie coming from a good book.  If you like the movie read the book.  Reading the book gave me a different feeling than the movie the movie is very convincing in its attacks of materialism and 9-5  life.  As you read the book you start to see that alot of the material is  rehashed nihilism mixed with a little masochism.  The book pushes alot of  pop culture buttons that Ihave heard before  such as material positions and  owning property lead to numbness and weakness, men are weakened because of  lack of male role models and because they are raised by women, vilolence  brings a hire sense of male potency and awareness, you can know your self  only through self destuciton and hitting rock bottom.  BUT the book is  Entertaining, even if it is only to count how many pulp culture mantras it  chants.<br />The characters are complex and do embrace there self destructive  nature.  This book is about hitting bottom and it is done in a believalbe  fasion until about the end where things get a little to out of hand to be  believable.  I started reading Survivor.  Which is better so far both books  main characters become twisted messias of sort self destruction is a big  theme in both books.
6300218031|5.0|I consider this one of the top five best teen movies of the 80's [Can't Buy Me Love, Breakfast Club, 16 Candles, Weird Science].  Additionally, I think it tops its sibling film, Pretty in Pink. The story of an obvious,  unrequited love in the face of obsession is an old one.  Producer Hughes  has visited it often before and after, but the sincerity and heart-felt  depth of the performances here makes this a special realization. Tomboy  Watts, played by the luminous Mary Stuart Masterson, pines away secretly  for her shy, artistic, mechanic best friend Keith [Eric Stoltz]. Stoltz in  turn lusts after the school beauty Amanda Jones [Lea Thompson]. Villainy of  different degrees is provided by Amanda's snobbish friends, and her current  beau the devilish Hardy Jenss [Craig Sheffer giving us a taste of his  upcoming Nightbreed persona.] I've always had a soft spot for the Hughes  villains; and Hardy as the Corvette driving, Miami Vice homage-ing,  cheating, boyfriend stands up well against the languid lizard-like cool of  James Spader in Pretty in Pink.  Support for Keith is provided by his dad,  younger sisters, and a batch of new friends found in the depths of school  detention.  The movie revolves around Keith's courting of Amanda, and how  Watts must stand idly by while her devotion is deflected.  It becomes even  more heart breaking to observe her chauffeuring the two on their big date;  sobbing as she watches the two kiss in the light of an abandoned concert  venue.  Resolution comes at the party, to Charlie Sexton's Beat So Lonely.  Hardy and Keith square off with the results one might expect.  As this film  ages, after 13 years [!], I continue to enjoy the interplay between the  main characters when I see it.  There really isn't a weak performance all  the way around.  As another reviewer mentioned, this is ultimately a sweet,  reaffirming movie.
B00003W8NM|4.0|There is a gloomy wet pavement feel to this movie. Those seeking a  romantic angle will be disappointed beyond a bizarre relationship with the  female lead. <br />Violence is throughout the movie...its about fighting...so  consider yourself warned. Something lurks in the subtext here; are we  ultimately seeking leaders who can think for us? Rebuild us into something  bigger and stronger?<br />Many of the laughs are guilty laughs...we hear jokes  about men's breasts, support groups, the terminally ill seeking physical  interaction. May be a little tough on some folks. You were warned.<br />Edward  Norton is a compelling actor, and the disc set really provides everything  you would want. The commentary is useful and powerful. Great set.<br />This  movie is clearly too complex for most theatre patrons who prefer pokemon  and gladiators to plot and substance.
B0000025ZF|3.0|Roger's first solo album since leaving Pink Floyd didn't quite grab me at first few listens, and I originally dismissed it as pessimistic Waters sludge. There were simply too many lyrics to digest and not a lot of  memorable stand ouot moments. Upon further investigation, though, I realize  this is actually quite a fine album- a classic Waters concept album  following in the musical direction of the Wall and the Final Cut. I  consider Pros &amp; Cons part of a Waters concept Trilogy which started  with the Wall and Final Cut, though Pros &amp; Cons wasn't as interesting  or sucessful musically or conceptually as the previous two concepts. It  still is a decent listen though. There is enough Waters emotion and  personal angst in here to sastisfy anyone really into the Wall and Cut,  though a little harder to digest at first listen. Try listening to this  alone.
6305311463|5.0|I'm so glad that a Criterion edition of &quot;ARMAGEDDON&quot; was  released.  The story of a huge asteroid about to collide with Earth and a  group of oil drillers to prevent that from happening + Bruce Willis, what  more can you ask for right?<br />Well, all I can say is that if you do have  one choice for this movie, the Criterion Collection is the way to  go.<br />Yes, both movies have outstanding video and the digital 5.1 is used a  lot in this movie.  But that's where the comparisons end because the  regular version of the DVD has no extras.  The Criterion Collection version  is loaded with extras.  I mean fully loaded and each segment in the special  features are quite long.  One of my favorites happens to be the gag reel.<br />Also, the movie contains trailers.  Oh, no...not the typical 1-3  trailers that regular DVD's tend to have, this one has many trailers.  I'm  not sure how many trailers I counted for the 20-second or 10-second  segment.  This DVD is loaded with them.<br />Then another cool thing about the  DVD extras are how certain special effects were made.<br />So, yes, the  Criterion Collection cost about $10 more but it is probably one of the best  Criterion edition DVD's out there.  This version of Armageddon is highly  recommended!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Hmmmmmm....Well, I'm not too sure how to put this, but I'll try.  This is hands down, the greatest set of music I have ever heard.  It is so emotional and deep and, well...just see for yourself.  If this music  doesn't touch you, you must bee an insanely shallow and close-minded  person.  Oh wow, this music (if you can even call it that) is just straight  up beautiful.  And I'll admit, when I first bought it, I really did not  like it.  About a year later I listened to it again and fell in love.  Now  I listen to it at least once a day and it still isn't old.  I can't believe  these guys.  They are so incredible.  Buy this cd.  I don't know how I  could live without it.  It is a must own for ANYONE.
0140177396|5.0|I recently read this book for my 7th grade English class.  At first I was hesitant about reading a classic.  As soon as I got into the story, I soon found out that this book was not just a classic but a wonderful, excited  and touching tale about two lonely farmers searching for friends.  This  book has an astounding ending that everyone will be touched by.  Being on  13, this review must show how this book is appropriate for every age.  I  highly recommend this book.  Steinbeck has an interesting writting style  that sometimes is difficult to read but he gets his points across fluently.   Enjoy this wonderful book!
630589938X|3.0|Cujo was a very mediocre horror film based on kings work. Not up to par.
630575067X|1.0|This film has been incredibly overhyped, and the factor that it being the most anticipated movie of all time, I thought that it could have had higher expectations.   There was two good scenes: Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul  fighting, and the pod race.  The pod race wasn't suspenseful, because you  know the annoying boy has to win.  I'm sorry, but it hurts to insult a kid,  but it seems OK with a movie like this. There is no bright points in this  movie, and the acting was not good.  All they did was whisper to each  other. And there was Jar-Jar.  He was just what he was supposed to be: A  childish, annoying, clumsy imbecile.  You got to hand it to him, he's a  better actor than Liam Neeson in this film.  The casting wasn't good.<br />Put  it this way: Jar Jar doesn't belong; Chewy does.  Qui-Gon doesn't belong,  Han does.  Anakin doesn't belong; Luke does, and, of course, the Cinna-Bun  hair-styled Princess Leia.  That's the Star Wars I like.<br />I am one who  thought the first 3 were really good, because there was the chemistry.  I  think that Lucas did this for the money and the hype and his extra 15 years  of fame.  Another funny thing is that it looks newer than the original, but  it's supposed to be before the original.<br />I do not recommend this movie.   If you want to see a good movie, see American Beauty, and if you don't  already know the ending, Sixth Sense, or...The Lion King, I guess.  OR THE  ORIGINALS AGAIN.
0920236820|5.0|Elizabeth has it made. Not only is she a princess, but she's got everything that goes with being a princess -- a castle, good looks, a great wardrobe, and Prince Ronald for a fiance. Then along comes a dragon who smashes her castle, incinerates her clothes, kidnaps her boyfriend, and  musses her hair.<br />          An ordinary princess would dissolve into  heartbroken sobs at this point, but Elizabeth is anything but ordinary. For  modesty's sake, she grabs the only covering available, a paper bag, and  sets out to find the dragon and rescue Ronald. The dragon tells her to go  away -- he's too full to eat a princess at the moment. Not to be put off,  Elizabeth tricks the dragon into proving just how mighty he is, and  exhausting himself in the process. When the dragon is soundly asleep,  Elizabeth opens the door to the dragon's lair and finds Ronald. <br />         Ronald, who, for want of a better word, is a royal jerk, doesn't even say  &quot;thank you.&quot; Instead, he shakes his finger at Elizabeth and  scolds, &quot;Elizabeth, you are a mess! Your hair is all tangled and you  are wearing a dirty old paper bag. Come back tomorrow when you are dressed  like a real princess.&quot;          As you might guess, Elizabeth tells  him off and goes skipping into the sunset. Even my four year old, usually  the champion of any prince in any tale, cheers for Elizabeth at the end. As  for his sister, well, Ronald just confirms her theory that no boy is as  good as her dad (except for maybe one certain boy in her class, but that's  another story altogether).
B00000K19E|4.0|My opinion toward the special effects in this movie is definitely top notch and deserves all the technical academy awards it deserves.  And through these special effects, it has better expressed the &quot;what is  reality&quot; phenomenon that has been touch on before, but never in this  &quot;techno&quot; way.  However, I cannnot say the matrix is an original  movie due to its ideas and plot that have been explorer before.  Perhapes  revolutionary to some degree, but not original.  And where originality can  hold its own, special effects cannot.  Sooner or later, its awesome  &quot;bullet time&quot; and subtle details will give way to even better  visual and audio.<br />If I were given 0 to 10, I would give this a 7 (where 5  is the average movie, and 10 is &quot;movie of all movies&quot;).  The DVD  in my opinion is worth getting.  The picture and sound quality are REALLY  GOOD.
0804106304|5.0|I would say this is nothing sort of genius.  The juxtaposition of the mothers' and daughters' stories is very compelling.  One of the most fascinating aspects of the novel is to be able to  understand life in China  through the stories of the mothers.
6304681496|5.0|Con Air is by far THE greatest movie ever made!  Why? you ask, well, it's actually quite simple.  John Malcovich as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grisom was the greatest choice for the role, Cage, who had a bad accent (it's quite  annoying really but you get used to it), was good other than that.  This  movie is soooo incredably funny!  If you really like action movies this is  definately for you!  Even if you don't it has some great lines in it.   <br />However the other reviewers ARE right when they say it is a little, just  a little, unlikely.  BUT WHO CARES!  I mean really, people like movies  such as Air Force One, The Matrix and STAR WARS (oh, theres a big one) who  are also very, very, very unlikely.  So don't bad mouth Con Air for being  unlikely because almost every other movie is too!  <br />Con Air is really  addictive, I think this has something to do with the stunts, funny scenes,  but probably most of all is the music.  Most soundtrack scores aren't done  with an electric guitar, Con Air is.  It makes the movie powerful and  original.  <br />Aside from Cage's horrid accent, the only bad part is at the  end.  Gee, I was really pulling for Cyrus.
0792156684|1.0|This is the only question I can ask about this film. Why was it so popular, why did it win so many awards and why are so many people in love with it?<br />This film won best picture, beating out the true best film of  '97, LA Confidential. That movie had one of the most interesting stories,  and some of the best dialogue a Hollywood movie has had in ages. The story  of the Titanic is well known, and has been done to death in the past. The  dialogue for Titanic is horrid, it was overly long by about an hour. What  you're left with is the special EFX, which in all honesty aren't that  great.<br />I honestly can't see the film's appeal. Maybe it's because I'm not  a romantic, but this film did absolutely nothing for me. Not even Kate  Winslet's bare bossoms could save it.
6304681496|5.0|For all of you who say it's racist, well fine, go ahead i'm not going to slam you for your opinion, so don't slam me for mine when i say this is the greatest movie.  if you didnt like it, please dont share, because there are  millions of people who did like it, and im not going to slam your favourite  movie because i didnt like it.  this movie is also told to be glamorizing  criminals, not at all.  they all got caught in the end didnt they?  so what  if the socios paths are likeable, they arent real are they? some kids might  think they are but then again they shouldnt be watching this movie if you  think it's making deaths look funny.  people still like computer games, and  nintendo, and hey, James Bond even trows a few funny kills, so stop bad  mouthing my movie, if you didnt like it, so what, dont critisize those of  us who did.
0783225970|4.0|Scarface is one of the classic gangster films of all time. My only complaint is it's length. It could have been easily cut down, but that aside, it's a work fans of the genre need to see.<br />Though I have seen  movies that are much more violent, Scarface strikes a very deep nerve. The  violence on the screen seems much more worse than it really is, and it  isn't just the violence that will make you uneasy.<br />The film had to be  this way. If you come out of watching it with a &quot;I'd really like to be  like that guy!&quot; attitude, then you really didn't watch very closely.
0385484518|5.0|How lucky Mitch Albom was to see his former professor on \\"Nightline\\" as he flipped through the channels one night in 1995.  How fortunate that he had another chance to reacquaint himself with the teacher that had been most  important to him as a college student.  How grateful I was to read this  description of the \\"final thesis\\" between a superior teacher and a  completely invested student.  The wonder of TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE is right  there--in being a completely invested student of Morrie Schwartz, Mitch  Albom becomes better invested in life and in love and less sunk into our  materialistic culture.<br />\\"Death ends a life, not a relationship.\\"  Dying of  Lou Gehrig's disease, Morrie reminds us that we live on through our love.   But our love needs our attention: the people that we love need us to be  \\"fully present.\\"  I saw at least two of Morrie's three interviews with Ted  Koppel and I can still hear his voice, just as I can still hear the voice  of a favorite professor of mine who died four years after I graduated from  college--a rushed hug as I marched by him in my cap and gown was our final  contact.  Morrie helped me forgive myself for that, and I keep in good  touch now with the other teachers who meant the most to me.  That way I  show respect for the legacy of those that I never thanked enough.<br />This  book is short, but neither underdone or overdone.  Nowhere is it flat,  nowhere does it sermonize, per se.  But it is a taught class, and as such  can be didactic.  Take a lesson with Morrie, it doesn't matter how jaded or  cynical you are or you think you are, you will find much that is valuable  in this book.
0792844793|5.0|For people wanting to get into Lynch's work, this is the best place to start. It takes a subject that has been done to death in the past, but puts a totally fresh and new twist on it.<br />Frank is the perfect film villian as  well. A man so sick, twisted and evil, you just have to love him. Everybody  in this film puts on a first rate preformance.<br />Rent it tonight.
0790734850|5.0|Maybe a strong title, but it definitely rings true.<br />People who think Hollywood is only producing big budget, special efx-laden action films need to see this. An adaptation of James Ellroy's brilliant novel, this is a  film that will please fans of drama, mystery/suspense or thriller  films.<br />Everybody puts on a great performance, and the story/dialogue is  some of the best for any movie in ages. <br />Now, however this film lost Best  Picture to Titanic is anybody's guess. I guess that is now one of the  great, unanswered mysteries of life.
0553573403|5.0|Never before was I involved in a book so deeply, so profoundly! never before was I emersed like that in a world, or toched by the carecters fate with such intensity that when it was finished I wept for days because I  missed them all,and I couldent wait for the sequel to see what befell those  people who were so real to me that they lived and breathed.There were  scenes that were so real that I could actuely see them.I was there with  them.And the languege so rich and beutiful.I loved the courting scene  between Danya and her husbend where all he could say was one word,again and  again, he said only that word and so captured her hart-brilient! The writer  chose the right words that made the book so strong and sensitive at the  same time. He maneged this without losing the pace of the story,the suspens  and action. Bravo!
6305252521|5.0|I love this movie because it's very interesting and comical. I thought that all the actors did a great job.  It is one of my very favorite movies.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Excelent and very complex album, that will send shivers down your spine... classic Iron Maiden bits that are so many, embedded in the more modern sound that the successful record must have. I grew up with Iron Maiden, and  it seems that they have matured along the way. After some stray-shot  albums, finally... something that will fit the sentiments of the veteran  fans, and possibly attract some new kids as well. Serious heavy fans  (Pantera etc) will not like it though.<br />Up the Irons!
158234082X|4.0|For anyone who has ever been &quot;on the line&quot; in either the restaurant, hotel or club business, Tony Bourdain's book has got to strike some terribly hilarious, regrettable, passionate, degenerate and, most of  all, familiar chords with you. If you haven't been where Tony's been, the  world he describes might seem a little outrageous and far-fetched; but the  honest truth from one who lived a lot of what Bourdain describes is that  the characters he so lovingly talks about in his book are in almost every  way, the characters I worked with for over 25 years. I know them all! He  tells it just like it is. Bourdain has almost a reverent regard for the the  men and women who ply their craft well and without delusions of  grandeur,day in day out,on the cooking lines of the world--- regardless of  what psychological abnormalities, bad habits,or sexual idiosincracies they  might be afflicted with. He also loves food, as is obvious in his  passionate description of Scott Bryan's food; and the wonderful cinematic  tour of the Tsukiji(Tokyo's central fish market). GOOD JOB CHEF! And try to  cut down a little on the booze--- as it will help a with the excrutiating  muscular aches in your legs.
B00004STPT|5.0|This is one of Zimmer's best.  Honestly, the integration of voices with the power of the orchestral background was something I found to be extremely powerful, especially in the specific scenes of the  film.<br />Ultimately, this soundtrack grabs the lister.  A little brutal at  times, the score can be a bit loud to the ear (it is not all relaxing!).   However, this is Zimmer at his best.  His experimentation with new themes  is excellent in this broad-scoped score.
B000003NA4|5.0|I think I first heard Ms. Krall on the radio with Peel Me A Grape and just loved the song.   Once I bought the CD I found many more songs that I liked (I Don't Know Enough About You ... I Miss You So).    I have subsequently  purchased her other CD's and while I like them as well,  this is the one I  play the most ... more than most of the other CD's I own in other  genre's.<br />It definitely is in my favorites pile !
0451191153|5.0|The Fountainhead is not the typical peice of literature.  Despite the great popularity of the book, it should not be in the same category as Jane Eyre or A Tale of Two Cities.  The Fountainhead is the Bible of the truly  righteous.  I write this as a plea to others, who truly love and understand  this book, to ignore the criticisms of the unenlightened.  Ignore the  official organization of objectivists.  The members do not see the extent  to which they err.  Sit quietly.
B00004TEWP|5.0|ok, the cd is great, we all know that. But what about the extra tracks... girl in the mirror: is a beatiful song, and shows Britney vocal skills. Is not great but is very good. Heart: this is a GREAT song, is really cool. a  little sad. Is a ballad. You got it all: this is an old song, was recorded  in 1997 so is weird find it here, but is just a GREAT song. Is a medley  between the old and the new Britney work. I thing is very cool!  the rest  of the cd is creat, in special Lucky, where are you now and oops The cover  of Satisfaction is fine, but is not great, i think that is one of the worst  songs in the cd. sorry! but again, the cd is great!
0783114222|5.0|I saw this mini-series when it aired on HBO, and when the DVD set was available at the library, I checked it out and watched it twice.  Finally, we broke down and bought the set; its worth three times it's price!  My six  year old enjoys watching it with us, as he has an interest in anything  related to space.  Each episode is wonderful, providing accurate  information about the Apollo space program within the framework of vivid  storytelling.  The acting is top notch; it's hard to believe these guys  didn't actually go into space themselves! For entertainment or educational  purposes, From The Earth to The Moon is a must see by anyone interested in  the space program, or in the mood for good drama.
6305609691|5.0|One of the best films on the Vietnam War. This movie definitely goes among  other great Vietnam war movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Casualties  of War  and the documentary film Hearts and Minds. Charlie Sheen gave a  great performance here along with of course, Marlon Brando. Other actors in  this movie include Dennis Hopper, Lawrence Fishburne (see if you can spot  him), Harrison Ford (see you if you can spot him too), and Robert Duval,  remembered  for his one-liner &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the  morning.&quot; in this movie. The scenes are simply spectacular; shot  entirely in the Philippines. This is not your typical Vietnam War movie of  firefights. The story is simply haunting. Very very haunting. Charlie Sheen  who plays the part of a CIA black ops guy is ordered to assasinate a rogue  colonel played by Marlon Brando. Brando will scare you. I like the part  where Robert Duvall launches a chopper assault on an enemy village while  blasting Wagner music on speakers mounted  on the sides of the choppers.  This is a great movie. A lot of the other Vietnam movies that followed it  adapted a lot of the formulas done in this movie. Get this movie.
630587493X|1.0|Typical of Robin Williams' &quot;New Age&quot; drivel that he's been making lately.  Where is the actor of &quot;Dead Poet's Society,&quot; &quot;Good Will Hunting,&quot; and &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;?  This  film is TERRIBLE!  Not is it only overlong (it seemed like 200 years), but  the character development is nearly nonexistent and the themes overstated  and underdeveloped.  A clunker.  Some nice set design, though.
0195117298|1.0|I too expected more of this book based on prepublication advertising.  It is not a book for physicists, but for philosophers.  It does not compare well with other excellent books of a similar nature.  To state that there  are new physical principles in this self indulgent rambling is a misguided  statement.  If there were any concepts worth considering the author would  have made predictions or suggestions of how they would be tested or the  impact that his ideas would have on the scientific community.  A revolution  is needed against this type of book posing as a exposition of a new  physical principle.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Limp Bizkit did what all good bands should do, they evolved into something better.  Sure, they do not sound the same as they did on their debut, but this does not mean they &quot;sold out&quot;.  If every artist made their  cds all sound the same, well, that would become very boring.  Limp Bizkit's  goal was to improve on the original and define their sound, which they did,  to a degree.<br />First off, the terrible sound quality is gone and the music  is much crisper and finetuned.  The music itself is groove-oriented mixed  with some hip-hop and melody.  The guitars riffs are cool, yet kind of  simple, with some experimentation.  The drums are tight and fierce when  needed, mostly steady.  The bass is incredibly thick and driving, the  strongpoint of the cd. The scratching, the band's best quality, was sorely  lacking during most of the songs.  The music is once again simple, yet  steady.  What really captures the ear is Limp Bizkit's ability to create  song structures that go beyond the requisite verses and choruses creating a  building crescendo that seems to end all of their songs on a powerful and  high-energy note.<br />The lyrics are once again simplistic and childish  although Fred Durst has an ability to create rhymes and words that people  seem to enjoy and are easily sung to and catching to the ear.  At least to  most young teenagers.  What I admire about Fred Durst is that while he has  very little talent he does try to expand his vocal range adding much more  experimentation to his vocals.  Besides the requisite rapping and hardcore  screaming (although there is very little), Fred tries to add some melodic  singing and hip-hop type rapping.  Unfortunately, he can do neither well.   The energy and stage presence are still there, but the emotion is still  lacking from his vocals, even moreso on this cd than their debut.  Still, I  would have to say much improved.  The guest vocals are one of the strong  points on the cd as well, excluding Method Man.<br/>The cd as a whole is just  so much better than Limp Bizkit's debut, though much more  &quot;mainstream&quot;.  &quot;Nookie&quot;, &quot;Trust?&quot;, and  &quot;I'm Broke&quot; are very groove-oriented featuring rap-style vocals  overlayed with thick and catchy choruses.  &quot;Break Stuff&quot; is one  of their harder songs yet features very childish lyrics.  &quot;9 Teen 90  Nine&quot; is another fairly heavy song featuring some harder edged vocals.   The best songs on the cd like &quot;Re-arranged&quot;, &quot;Nobody Like  You&quot;, &quot;Don't Go Wandering&quot; and &quot;No Sex&quot; feature  more of a melodic quality intertwined within a cool vibe.  The rest of the  songs are sorely lacking and deter from the Limp Bizkit sound.<br />Though  much improved from their previous effort, Limp Bizkit still has far to  venture.  Especially the lyrics and music department.  They have the song  structures perfected but the music itself is simplistic much like the  lyrics.  Vocally, there is not much more that can be done.  While Limp  Bizkit is good, they are still creating music for the mass market.  Sure,  they say the music is for their fans and whatnot, but who are they kidding.   Their music and style is extremely marketable and the music and lyrics  itself is so simplistic and untalented.  Music should be about the passion  of creating something from your heart and sharing it to the world.  Not  becoming labeled by MTV as &quot;the next big thing&quot; and then becoming  popular.  Sure, I will continue to like and enjoy Limp Bizkit's music but I  will never become inspired by the likes of them.  For in today's society  where untalented bands can become a staple overnight while truly talented,  passionate and inspirational bands are overlooked, will forever tear at me.   That is why I will continue to be an avid supporter of the underground  scene and to those of you who are into the mainstream, so be it as long as  you are not a poser.  However, you know not what you are missing.  Peace.
B000002B82|4.0|<br />I am definitely not your stereotypical Ozzy fan. As a child in the 80s, I was brought up to believe Ozzy was satanic. I'd never heard his music, and adults were telling me to never listen to it, so I didn't. But I grew  up and matured, and during college I developed new tastes in music. When  Ozzy released No More Tears back in 1991, I was exposed not to a satanic  Ozzy, but a musical genius with depth of power and emotion. No More Tears  is an incredible release, not only for when you just wanna let off steam  and head bang, but also for when you wanna just kick back and take in life.  <br />\\"Mr. Tinkertrain\\" starts out with a surreal, mellow, child-like  soundscape, but it soon turns into a head bangin' ride. Fun and driving  full force ahead, \\"I Don't Want to Change the World\\" rocks and makes a  great point (\\"...I don't want the world to change me\\"). \\"Momma I'm Coming  Home\\" (released as a single) is beautiful and is one Ozzy's power ballads  for the album. Revving up the guitars once again, \\"Desire\\" has a great  attitude and takes aim at his skeptics and detractors (\\"And I can't stop  `cause it drives them crazy\\"). Another successful single at the time, the  title track \\"No More Tears\\" is an amazing composition of guitars, deep  synths, and strings that is driving and subtle, beautiful and hauntingly  eerie (thanks to Ozzy's lyrics and vocals) all at the same time. Tormented  by inner as well as outer demons, \\"S.I.N.\\" is Ozzy's cry for help (done in  classic manic Ozzy style). \\"Hellraiser\\" - now there's a definition of Ozzy  if there ever was one. Again self-reflective, this is a slower but driving  guitar and drum classic with great harmonies. \\"Time After Time\\" is the  other touching and beautiful power ballad on the release. Seeming to talk  about his issues with drugs and alcohol, \\"Zombie Stomp\\" (like the name  suggests) is a real stomper (once it gets going) that uses some interesting  sampling in the long building intro. I'm not sure what the title \\"A.V.H.\\"  refers to, but the song is manic and a head on rock collision (\\"I'm riding  on a train I can't control\\"). Wrapping up the release, \\"Road to Nowhere\\" is  a solid rock anthem takes a look back on Ozzy's life with no regrets; even  though \\"The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me,\\" he points out that \\"The  Road to Nowhere leads to me.\\" <br />The whole release really is a fun  thrashin' head trip that makes you think and reflect at times. A solid 4  star release, No More Tears is sometimes just what I need to vent or get  the adrenaline pumping. My only negative regarding Ozzy's music is his  references to drug use. While they aren't too frequent, and I know that's  just part of being Ozzy, they still do bug me given my anti-drug stance  (not preaching, just a fact). However, it's only music, and music doesn't  make you do things, you do; I have the maturity and stability of mind to  get past it. <br />My dilemma is how to recommend the album. I'm not an Ozzy  \\"fan\\" per se - I'm a yuppie for pete's sake; what self-respecting Ozzy fan  will take me seriously? I don't own any of his other albums or any of his  work with Black Sabbath, so I'm not sure how this release compares to any  of his others. But if you're anything like me, some uptight suit and tie  corporate slave who needs to occasionally unwind, Ozzy's No More Tears  might just be the little pill you need to take to be able to get up and  face another day. <br />Looking through the other reviews, it appears that the  timing was perfect for me. I was in a mode to accept new and different  music, and Ozzy was at a time when his musical and lyrical expertise were  peaking. If you're not the typical Ozzy fan but have been always curious,  give No More Tears a listen and decide for yourself - satanic, or bad-a**  rocker genius? I think you'll surprisingly find the latter.
B000001Y42|3.0|Limp Bizkit is the perfect example of a band with little talent, yet has succeeded in the music industry.  There are several reasons for this anomaly.  One, they were introduced by Korn and their album was produced by  Ross Robinson.  Two, they surfaced during a time period when  &quot;rapcore&quot; was getting popular, although Korn and the Deftones do  not fall into that category.  Finally, and most importantly, the band Limp  Bizkit has phenomenol stage presence and an incredible live show.   Unfortunatley, this cd does not caputure that energy or intensity.<br />The  sound quality on this cd is terrible, sounding more like some kind of  garage demo than a major-label debut.  The sound is very raw and downtuned,  an unfortunate trademark of Ross Robinson.  The music itself is a hybrid of  hip-hop meets heavy metal in the Sepultura tribal type vein.  Featuring  aggressive beats, chunk-filled riffs, throbbing bass, and accented by the  amazing scratching, Limp Bizkit's sound may not be original but it is  tempo-laden and nonstop energy.  The song structures are simple as well as  the music but the flow is there, although limited.<br />Fred Durst has an  amazing stage precence.  He knows how to get a crowd riled up which is very  important.  However, as a songwriter and a vocalist, he has much to learn.   He cannot rap, his lyrics are simplistic, almost childish featuring idiotic  rhymes, and his voice has an annoying sounding quality.  The only  strongpoint is his ability to switch to his heavy side featuring some sick  screaming.  Sure, he may talk about everyday issues that people deal with,  but the emotion and conviction are lacking behind his words.<br />To say that  this is one of the best cds out there today is beyond me.  Sure songs like  &quot;Pollution&quot; and &quot;Counterfeit&quot; are awesome featuring  cool riffs, high energy and in-your-face choruses, but the rest of the cd  is sorely lacking.  &quot;Stalemate&quot; is another very good song, moredynamic with just a cool groove.  &quot;Stuck&quot; is also decent.   &quot;Leech&quot; which is a cooler, heavier song, and supposedly a demo  version, had the same sound quality as the rest of the songs, showing that  Limp still had a ways to go.  &quot;Sour&quot; is short, but sweet,  previewing what was to come from Limp Bizkit.  In conclusion, a couple of  very good songs, then some fair efforts, nothing special.<br />Aside from DJ  Lethal and Sam Rivers, possibly Wes Borland, Limp Bizkit has very little  musical talent.  What they are lacking in talent they more than make up in  style and energy.  If this was a concert review, the rating would be  higher, but it's not and this cd is just not good enough.  Sounding like  nothing more than a demo, Limp Bizkit merely showed that they had much  farther to go if they wanted to become a staple in the music industry.   While they do the rapcore thing decently enough there are many more bands  out there that may not be mainstream but do the entire rapcore thing much  better.  Examples:  Superheist, Madhops, Spine, Papa Roach, Primer 55, 20  Dead Flower Children, Frontside, and Greedy Edna.
1573226521|4.0|Alex Garland committed the supreme crime against escapism. He picked up the axiomatic of « Lord of the Flies » and transposed it into our world, on some virgin island in Thailand, with adults who are trying to escape from  our consumer's society to reach paradise on earth with total separation  from the world (not so total after all since they have a boat to go back to  civilization and buy some food, some batteries and some other items of the  type), with the sun, the perfect water of a lagoon, a lot of dope  (marihuana), and some coconut beer. A limited, secret society of its own.  This society is dominated by a woman who exerts absolute power and chess  manipulation over the members, her children in her mind. They work every  morning, either fishing, or gardening, or carpeting, or cooking. Then they  enjoy the sun, the sand, the water and the jungle around them the rest of  the time, and then in the evening and night, their dope and their total  hallucinating trips. One of the founders escapes from there, haunted that  he is by the Vietnam war that does not disappear from his memory, and sends  three new comers to this beach. These three arrive and are accepted and we  delve into the psychology of the narrator, a certain Englishman Richard,  and we discover the transformation with the erasing of time and space, of  any social link with the outside world. They are obliged to share the  island with some Thai people who are illegally growing marihuana in another  part of the island. The description of this going back to the wilderness is  marvellously described and analyzed, though interlaced with mental visits  of the escaped founder who had committed suicide in Bangkok, before giving  Richard the map of the island. And we discover that this society is a  perfectly human society. But, due to some crises (the attack of three  fishermen by a shark, the subsequent death of two of them and mental  derangement of the third one, the menace of the arrival of five more  uninvited - except by Richard in Bangkok - newcomers, their interception by  the military guards of the marihuana fields and their subsequent torturing  and killing), we find out that Sal, the female chief of this escapist  society, is a real fascist, able to order Richard to kill the deranged  fisherman when he escapes, and to do what is nevcessary to stop the new  comers, which means death, though this death will come from the marihuana  guards. She is the mother of this society, some kind of God-Mother who has  the right of life and death over all the members, who forces them to work  hard for survival, etc. The book reveals that normal adults who want to  flee from consumer's society in our modern conditions, without any excuse  since they do this trip voluntarily, that those normal adults regress to a  primitive life style, but also to an absolute didactorship out of fear, an  overprotective spirit concerning their little world, the secrecy of this  world, their total rejection of the outside world, and of course their  deeply ingrained death instinct. And this regression leads them to the  blurring out of the thin limit between life and death, I mean the life and  death of others (for every single one member). And luckily, just before, or  rather in the middle of the killing of Richard by the other members who are  drunk and stoned, Richard, the two friends he came with, another friend he  made on this island and an older and mysterious friend of his, will manage  to escape before being caught up in absolute horror, and death. Their is no  escape from our world that does not lead to the primitive mentality of the  clan and the absolute dependence the clan requires from any member and the  killing by all members of those who may not be absolutely in line with that  collective crushing of individual minds. This book is a masterpiece that  goes beyond « Lord of the Flies », because it deals with willing adults,  with a voluntary escape, and also with the colonial and imperialistic  spirit that lies behind : they capture a piece of territory in Thailand and  make it their own. This is emphasized by the constant allusions to Vietnam,  brought into the psychology of Richard by the dead escapee's ghost who gave  him the map, because for him this beach is Saigon just before the fall in  1975. A must for all those who think that escape is possble and desirable.

B0000399WI|1.0|My third submission on this, if you are doubtful, check for yourself. I own the VHS of Shawshank. I recently purchased a DVD player and Shawshank was one of my first disks. I set both the disk and the tape up to play  simultaneously, and flipped back and forth to compare the superb quality  improvement of DVD. I was in for a surprise. The picture DOES NOT get  wider-AS IT SHOULD-and the top and bottom of the picture of the DVD version  are ERASED and replaced by the black bars. The other movie I found with  this flaw is Jackie Brown. Check out the point where Bridget Fonda   &quot;services&quot; Robert DeNiro. On the VHS widescreen version , her  &quot;buns&quot; disappear. They are fully visable on the fullscreen  version! The top and bottom have been erased on the widescreen version and  the picture does not get any wider.  I suspect more movies have this flaw.  Now that we know what to look for, let's look!
B000002O4X|5.0|This is one of my favorite sound tracks. Who else but Sir John Barry can wed the feeling of an intimate moment with the scope and grandeur of the African continent?        My personal favorite is the music playing while  Robert Redford's character is flying Meryl Streep's character over the  African Plain.        It's appaent that her breath is simply taken away -  as will anyone's who takes a  luxurious hour to listen to the haunting and  beautiful melodies of this sound track.
B00003W8NM|5.0|If you are like me then you didn't buy the pre-release machismo hype!  If you are like me you listened, despite your usual good judgement, to all the idiot critics who called the movie a waste of time.  If you are like me you  rented the movie and felt cheated having missed it on the big screen.  If  you are like me you will buy the dvd version and watch it again and again  and love it more each time.  Your head'll collapse if there's nothing in  it.  Where is my mind?  Way out on the water, see it swimming?
630420065X|1.0|It's a good movie, if you ignore the fact that there is no plot.  Tom  Cruise stumbles about the movie, going from place to place.  Why?  NOBODY  KNOWS!  The plot twisted and turned more that a snake stuck in a cement  truck drum.  Why does Ethan Hunt hang himself from a wire a few inches  above a sensor-rigged floor?  NOBODY KNOWS!  Why is Mr. Phelps throwing  fake blood around?  NOBODY KNOWS!  This movie should have been scrapped.   It's Impossible that a movie could be this horrible.  Best thing to come  out of it was the theme song.
B000005RFQ|4.0|Actually, it did.  Anyone who can read can glance at the insert and see that this album placed number 4 on the charts when it debuted.  Not too shabby, is it?  Of course not, but when an album becomes a mass-market  sellout...thankfully, enough people despise Black Sabbath to keep them a  somewhat underground favorite.<br />Ian Gillan sure sounds different than he  did during Deep Purple Mk 1, with a new force to his voice.  Singing softly  one moment and screeching at the top of his lungs the next, Gillan  characterizes the bruising frame of \\"Born Again.\\"  Chord for  chord, the Sabs orchestrated perhaps the heaviest album they've ever done.   It comes as no surprise that it happened when Tony and Geezer came the  closest they ever would to reuniting the original lineup.  Bill Ward drums  with a ferocity reminscent of his earlier days before his health  deteriorated, and no offense Vinny Appice, but Bill Ward can mop the floor  with you any day of the week.<br />With the remastered version, \\"Born  Again\\" actually sounds respectable and compared to the original mix,  it's a Beethoven nocturne with a demonic twist.  Here and there, you can  actually hear Geezer thumping away with the bass, but on \\"Digital  'Female Dog'\\" you can crank up both the volume and the bass until  sparks fly from your speakers and you still can't hear it.  Tony proves  that no one can out-sludge the master of grinding guitar-work, and he turns  in his best riffing since at least \\"Sabotage.\\"  It proves that a  heavy metal superstar doesn't have to be wacked-out on speed to be the  greatest.<br />\\"Trashed\\" is perhaps the hardest-hitting song on the  album, and not just because of its machine-gun guitars or savage vocals.   The lyrics are no subtle poison-in-the-wine but a sledgehammer through the  skull, driving home the point in a blunt and painful way.<br />The only  problem with this album are the two instrumentals, \\"Stonehenge\\"  and \\"The Dark.\\"  It would have been nice if Tony and Ian had  decided to record two more classic tracks such as \\"Zero the  Hero.\\"  Yeah, yeah, Guns'n'Roses stole the riff for their own  \\"Paradise City,\\" the thievin' blackguards, and even though you  couldn't call them a luvvy-duvvy hair-metal band, they still aren't  fit to  lick Black Sabbath's boots, much less copy original crushing rhythm.  It's  only a matter of time before some white-rap band like Limp Bizkit steals  the hallowed \\"Iron Man\\" and escapes a lawsuit.<br />Do not overlook  \\"Born Again.\\"  Of all the five-star post-Ozzy albums, this is my  favorite, and I've only had it for two weeks.  Heavy in a new sense and  powerful in the strictest meaning of the word, it was a brief return to  form and majesty.  Too bad it didn't last...

B00003W8NM|3.0|Fight club gets off the ground brilliantly with Ed Norton playing a severely lonely man that finds companionship through support groups ranging from people with TB to testicular cancer.  It is funny, and initially feels  like it could be the smash breakthrough brilliant film of 1999.  It  continues strong through the 2/3 mark, at which time audience members are  on their seats with excitement at just how well done everything is. . . and  then comes the crash.  The &quot;reveal&quot; of Norton's psychiatry is  insulting to the intelligent viewer and the film cannot deliver on the  &quot;6th Sense&quot; verses &quot;Usual Suspects&quot; approach that it  tries.  As we say in Hollywood, and audience can always forgive a poor  start with a great end. . . but a fantastic start with a terrible end will  leave the audience hollow.  This is the answer to why people hate the film.   Truly disappointing given how awesome it is initially.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Is David Fincher our generation's Hitchcock?  Time will tell, but with a triple crown of Se7en, The Game and now The Fight Club, he's making the case.  And he is, at least and certainly in terms of sheer audacity and  breathtaking filmmaking.  Fincher is a great supporter of new technology  and certainly the lavish care devoted to this DVD (packaging, sound/video  quality, extras galore) is fabulous, and even without all of this added,  great stuff, it's a film you'll return to again and again.  In the spirit  of Tyler Durden, though, why does Amazon have these stupid &quot;Was this  review helpful to you or not&quot; buttons?  (Read:  gee, I disagree with  this reviewer, therefore this review is not helpful).  What is this, the  vote for high school queen and king?  Do I care?  PLEASE - make sure you  vote &quot;No&quot; for me and, through your vote, for the whole point of  THE FIGHT CLUB and Tyler Durden!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This new LP from Eminem is very balanced. I believe that the best songs on the CD are Stan and Real Slim Shady. It will make you think as well understand the stardom of Eminem. Once again Dre hooked Em up with a phat  crew and tight bounce. If you got it check out #15 its the single of the  future. This CD will allow you to laugh and carry on but can get seriuous  and will. This CD has a great mix of comedy and rap. I like it.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I used to dislike Britney Spears. I thought her music was to bubbly, and all those rumours about her &quot;enhancement&quot; just made me dislike her. But I begin to read more about her, really listen to her music, and I  have respect for her. That's when I bought &quot;Oops!...I Did It  Again&quot;. Her music hits the soul! From strong dance beats (title track,  Stronger, Can't Get No Satisfaction) to soothing melodies(When Your Eyes  Say It, Dear Diary) to songs you love (Lucky, What U See Is What U Get),  the cd satisfies all your music needs!I really like the song Lucky, that  tells the story of a girl who is big and famous, but doesn't know if she's  really happy. If it relates to Britney, I hope she knows, and I think she  does, that she has fans that will always be there for her.
6302293553|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the most worthwhile film I have ever  seen.  The first time I saw it I was choking on my pizza with laughter  before the film even began.  Every time I see the movie (it's getting on  near 30 times now)I find some funny line or bit I never noticed before.  I  own the film, and every time I get depressed, I watch it and it pulls me  out.  It's not been out of my VCR since I got it, and I watch it all the  time.  It's great background noise, conversation piece, and WONDERFUL  entertainment.  There is not one 10 min block of film without atleast 4  obvious jokes and one not-so-obvious.  The running jokes throughout the  film crack me up every time...no matter how many times one sees the film  the incredible humor is still impossible not to laugh at. the acting in the  film is wonderful, the plot hilarious, the writing itself creative and  wonderful, the direction great... Each scene is a favorite, each line is an  inside joke waiting to happen, each funny bit will keep it's humor until  you die;  it's not an expense to buy the film, it's an investment.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|a classic.  I was going to give the movie 3 stars, until I found out how low budget the film was. I have to admit they did an excellent job with what they had to work with, hence the 4 star rating.  The plot is a little  thin, but the movie does have some pretty creepy moments. My favorite was  the girl who was guessing the cards before they were picked up from the  deck. Her back was turned, and the way her voice was changing by the second  was really creepy, it gave me the willies before she even turned around.   The only thing I didn't see in the movie was the supposed subtle humor.  Maybe I'm just thick-headed and didn't &quot;get it,&quot; but I saw  nothing funny in this movie. Just lots of gore, nasty jump-out-of-your-  seat surprises, and alot of goosebumps.  It's worth buying. After renting  it I went out and bought it to add to my collection.  Much better than  &quot;The Blair Witch Project.&quot;
B00002E285|4.0|Overall, this was an excellent film.  The cinematography was good, and of course, the music was outstanding.  However, it was not without its weaknesses.  The animated sequences are the high points of the movie.  They  should have been emphasized over the drab live-action pieces.  The entire  &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Worms&quot; sequences  would have been greatly improved had there been some sort of animation  involved.  They're the fantasy of a lunatic, and would have benefited from  the surrealistic atmosphere of Scarfe's drawings.  It was somewhat  frustrating, because I found myself imagining what the movie COULD have  been, compared to what it actually was.  However, this shouldn't give the  impression that I didn't enjoy the movie, I did immensely.  This film is a  must-see for Pink Floyd fans, as well as anyone looking for something a  little different.

B000002HJD|4.0|There are countless volumes of poetry lying on dusty shelves, unread and dying. Because Jim Morrison had the oppourtunity,because of his success, to go into a studio on his birthday with his poems,and a bottle of Irish  whiskey , we can enjoy his very provocative take on modern American life  the way poems are best enjoyed,in the poets own voice. The surviving Doors  did a terrific job with the music and sound effects. I've been listening to  this album for years, on and off,and it's always like meeting up with an  old friend.
0805062971|4.0|This is the first book I ever read in which the movie based on it was better. The book was just too choppy, your here then your there. The movie took the plot and made it tighter. The best way to put it is the book is  like a first draft, and the movie is the final draft. But without the book  and the ideas behind it, there would be no movie,so I give it 4 stars.
6303921248|5.0|I think it's safe to say that this BBC/A&amp;E mini-series is probably the best film adaptation of the classic novel ever made.  Unlike other versions, this one has the luxury of several hours of available story time.   Great location shots give you the feel of early 19th century England.  The  whole cast is excellent, but Colin Firth deserves special praise for his  absolutely perfect portrayal of Mr. Darcy.
0783240503|4.0|It is pretty rare that Broadway shows get released on home video (&quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; come to mind), so rejoice in the video and DVD release of this jubilant show.  I saw this on Broadway  in 1982 with Andy Gibb's understudy in the lead, and it was a wonderful,  fun time.  This DVD version is a somewhat more visually elaborate version  of the glitz-and-glam revival from a few years back, and sometimes it feels  a bit too glitzy and glammy.  But the performances are top-notch, and  thanks to camera close-ups you can clearly see how much the cast members  are enjoying themselves and having fun.  Good for all ages, despite some  semi-provacative clothing the dancers wear.  Catchy songs, lively  performances, often witty lyrics. However, viewers won't get the sense of  spontaneity that comes with live perfornance.  This is more of a long-form  music video than a filmed stage show, and we are the less fortunate for it.   This show is, by origin, a theater piece.  To not get that &quot;live in  one-take&quot; energy is a shame.  But the show is still fun to watch on  TV.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; is perhaps one of the most important works of music in the past decade- for that reason alone, you should own it.  If that's not a good enough reason for you, then conisder the fact that all of  the songs are fantastic.  From the electric kick-off provided in the form  of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; to the oddly soothing  &quot;Something In The Way&quot;, this album never loses its steam.  Kurt  Cobain's range as a guitarist and lyricist are wonderfully displayed here,  as he can go from screaming and spitting lyrics, to a barely audible  whisper (though more often than not, he's coming at the listener in full  force).  &quot;In Bloom&quot;, &quot;Come As You Are&quot;,  &quot;Breed&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot; and &quot;Stay  Away&quot; are my favorites, but really, this is the only album I have ever  encountered where I truly like every single song (KoRn's &quot;Follow The  Leader&quot; comes close, but it sort of falls apart at the end).  This  album deserves to be in anyone and everyone's record collection, be they  hard-core rocker or Brittnay Spears fan.
B00004TDTO|5.0|A few years ago, I and a few thousand other laserdisc fans plopped down  $150.00 and change for the super duper Signature Collection version of JAWS  on laserdisc.  It came with all the extras: -- bonus footage, outtakes,  interviews, marketing goodies, the CD soundtrack, novelization, and a few  other bells and whistles.  Now, some 4 or 5 years later, you lucky DVD  owners can get basically the same thing, minus the soundtrack and  paperback, for a fraction of the cost.  AND IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!  If this isn't your favorite movie, I'd be rather curious to know what IS!  The TNT network has run this film many times over the last few years, and  the copy they show has been beautifully restored and the color  &quot;tweaked&quot; a bit.  So just think of how great the DVD version is  gonna look!  And sound! Granted, and by Spielberg's own admission in the  laser's and DVD's accompanying interview footage, JAWS turned out as well  as it did almost by happy accident.  Spielberg initially was counting on  getting a great deal more footage of the mechanical sharks in the film, but  it was not to be (as a few humorous production stories in the interviews  will attest).  So JAWS had to take on a rather Hitchcock-ian feel instead  --  &quot;less is more&quot;, if you will.  Precious little shark footage  until the third act, and virtually every usable piece of mechanical shark  footage that was shot wound up in the film.  So it begs the question:  Is  JAWS as great a film as it is IN SPITE of itself?  Probably.  But who  cares?  Even if you are only a casual fan of this film, you owe it to  yourself to check out all the bonus features that come with this 25th  Anniversary set.  While not boasting as much bonus material as many other  DVDs have (THE ABYSS, ALIEN, the upcoming TERMINATOR 2 COLLECTOR'S  EDITION),  JAWS does have the advantage of being a very big part of  American pop culture, and the insight you can gain to this film from the  DVD extras actually draws you further into an already exciting movie  experience.  Now if we can only convince Universal Pictures to re-release  this film to theatres for this 25th Anniversary year. Even with the bonus  DVD and laserdisc features, this film will always play best in a big, dark,  crowded theater.  We should be able to let our kids experience it that way,  much like George Lucas did when he re-released his trilogy a few years ago.  There is at least one generation of people who never got to see JAWS 20  feet high and 48 feet across. And I challenge you to play this DVD will  full THX or  DTS Surround and NOT GET GOOSEBUMPS when John Williams' score  kicks in!raws you further into an already exciting movie  experience.

052594527X|4.0|I finished this book in just two nights - it was short, but also I was eager to discover Griet's fate. The story moves somewhat quickly through time. But the emphasis is on the relationship between characters and how  they keep their roles clear in this strictly divided society. Griet is a  most interesting protagonist.
0783240503|4.0|It is pretty rare that Broadway shows get released on home video (&quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; come to mind), so rejoice in the video and DVD release of this jubilant show.  I saw this on Broadway  in 1982 with Andy Gibb's understudy in the lead, and it was a wonderful,  fun time.  This DVD version is a somewhat more visually elaborate version  of the glitz-and-glam revival from a few years back, and sometimes it feels  a bit too glitzy and glammy.  But the performances are top-notch, and  thanks to camera close-ups you can clearly see how much the cast members  are enjoying themselves and having fun.  Good for all ages, despite some  semi-provacative clothing the dancers wear.  Catchy songs, lively  performances, often witty lyrics. However, viewers won't get the sense of  spontaneity that comes with live perfornance.  This is more of a long-form  music video than a filmed stage show, and we are the less fortunate for it.  This show is, by origin, a theater piece.  To not get that &quot;live in  one-take&quot; energy is a shame.  But the show is still fun to watch on  TV.
B00004SX0T|4.0|THIS CD IS very very good. i enjoyed this cd very much and i suggest you all buy it cause it is that good.  the besy songs on it are break stuuf, nookie and re-arranged
B000002U8G|4.0|I just recently purchased this album, which I have never heard before. I like some Floyd songs, but had never heard of this song &quot;Echoes&quot; until recently, so I tried it. And WOW! In my opinion, this is the most  incredible song I have ever heard, of any artist, EVER!  I have had this CD  for a month now, have listened to Echoes almost every day since then, and  STILL hear something new each time, understand something new each time, and  experience something new each time. I can't believe it, but after over a  hundred listens, I am not even beginning to tire of it. I Love this song!  Also, another song which feels great is &quot;Fearless&quot;. And &quot;One  of these Days&quot; is just awesome! This stuff puts you in a trance or  something I don't know, but you will like it!
B00004SX0T|5.0|this import cd by Limp Bizkit is very very good.  it is good for many reason but the best reason would be because of the number of good songs on it like: break stuff,, nookie, re-arranged, n 2 gether now, and show me  what you got.  this cd has more good songs than bad songs unlike many other  cd which only have 1 or 2 good songs.  i hope my review has some impact on  weather or not you purchese it so please do cause its a good one.
B000002ADT|5.0|Plain and simple; somehow, somewhere, get this album!  Whether you like jazz, disco, grunge, pop, acid, heavy metal, classical, country, or Russian folk music, this recod will blow you away.<br />A previous reviewer was  correct; not enough stars to rate this one.  It is a priceless masterpeice.   No matter how often you listen to it, you will discover something new.   You do not have to know modal jazz, you do not have to be a cool cat.  You  just have to have ears and a heart.<br />It goes without saying, but this  record is one of the top 3 or 4 recordings of all time and has influenced  everyone from Duane Allman to Frank Zappa.  <br />If you want smooth  perfection and an ever expanding sound that never grows old; GET THIS  RECORD.
6304578458|4.0|A one time Government agent turned independent contract killer, in need of some time off and a career change, goes home for his ten-year High School reunion in \\"Grosse Pointe Blank,\\" a black comedy from director George  Armitage.  Martin Blank (John Cusack) is on edge; two dissatisfied  customers and a competitor want him off the board, and his life is somehow  unsatisfying.  He's become \\"dispassionate, bored and uneasy.\\"  When he  receives an invitation to his reunion, he is encouraged to go, first by his  secretary, Marcella (Joan Cusack), and then by his analyst, Dr. Oatman  (Alan Arkin), who tells him to go and have a good time:  \\"Don't kill  anybody for awhile, see how it feels.\\"  When one of his unhappy customers  demands that he take a contract to make amends for what they consider a  botched job, and it coincidentally turns out to be in his home town, that  cinches it; he's off to Grosse Pointe, Michigan, to take care of business  and reevaluate his life.  When he hits town, he runs into an old flame,  Debi (Minnie Driver), the girl he stood up on prom night, after which he  subsequently vanished into thin air for the next ten years.  It was the  very night he ran off to join the army, which lead him to his current  \\"vocation\\" when his psych profile indicated that he had a certain \\"moral  flexibility.\\"  Quickly, the old flame reignites between Martin and Debi,  but there's a complication; Debi's father, Bert (Mitchell Ryan) is Martin's  intended victim, the fact of which Martin is thus far ignorant, because he  hasn't yet opened the dossier he's been given, which contains the details  of the job.  John Cusack gives a magnetic performance as the somewhat  apprehensive Martin, whose cool stoicism is beginning to erode in the face  of some personal misgivings concerning his chosen occupation.  He plays him  for what he is, just a working guy, no different than the postman or a  grocery clerk; and it's that realistic approach that makes this character  believable.  Minnie Driver is delightful here, thoroughly engaging as Debi,  giving her just the spark that's needed to make the connection between her  and Martin real.  Alan Arkin, too, brings his own style of dry humor to the  part of the anxious Dr. Oatman, who refuses to treat Martin (he's  admittedly afraid of him, as well as intimidated), but who has to, because  Martin keeps showing up at his office at the same time every week.  And  Joan Cusack adds that something extra with an energetic, funny performance  that raises the level of the movie just that much more.  Rounding out the  supporting cast are Dan Aykroyd, who does a good turn as Grocer, the rival  killer whose efforts at forming a \\"union\\" for the independents of their  profession are all for naught; Hank Azaria (Steven), K. Todd Freeman  (McCullers), Jeremy Piven (Paul), Ann Cusack (Amy) and Jenna Elfman  (Tanya).  With a driving soundtrack integrated into the action, clever  dialogue, some good action sequences, and especially the performances of  Cusack and Driver, \\"Grosse Pointe Blank\\" is a funny, entertaining film; and  with some imaginative touches by Armitage, who does a great job of keeping  the story on track and moving along, this is one you're going to be glad  you didn't let pass you by.
6305807086|3.0|This might just be the most overated movie of 1999.  I admit I was so eager to rent the movie on the advice of critics whose advice I admire, maybe that is why I felt so let down.  The acting was great, and the  premise was incredibly creative.  However, the story meanderd aimlessly,  and at points I started to really dislike the pathetic characters that  evolved.  The ending was a classic &quot;anti-ending&quot;, it left me  feeling cheated.  Even my art school wife found the movie somewhat  pointless, and she usually eats up this type of existential gibberish.  I  would have given it 3-1/2 stars, but this rating system doesn't allow it.   Not a bad movie to watch, just don't get your hopes up.
B00004SCX6|1.0|If I could rate this zero stars, I would. Anyone who says they like this is playing mind games with themselves! Britney Spears has an occasional interesting throaty vocal--but by and large her music (and videos) are  absolutely terrible! The lyrics, the composition, the performance, it's all  cheese! Commercially designed to sell to young girls! And you're buying  into it, congratulations.
B00003CXFU|5.0|People can argue that the movie did not present any moral dilemmas, and that it was quite shallow in that respect. But just how many of us really expected that out of the real life story of an ordinary woman who suddenly  trips on a path that would change her life forever?  I think the tale is  fairly simple - what makes the movie really and totally enjoyable is Julia  Roberts. I agree with everybody else that she does deserve an Oscar for  this performance. It was a Julia Roberts show all the way - and yet one  just couldn't get enough of her till the very end of the movie. She just  sparkled in every scene. After you've watched the movie - believe me -  you'll find it really hard to forget her for quite sometime. Overall the  movie didn't say very much,but just allowed us to share, and in a sense  experience, some extremely wonderful moments in a really adorable woman's  life who surely deserved a break from her otherwise dull and eventless  life.
B00000I8BX|5.0|wow, this album is absolutely one of the best in my collection. all the songs on this album are good. although i do have my favorites like shock, decent and ressurection. the songs kinda move you if you listen real  carefully to the lyrics. i gaurentee anybody that likes the metal type  music will like this.
0800141628|5.0|Even if you're a big believer in what the critics say, this film has been way too overlooked! So just put those feelings aside and get this movie! This movie, sort of a memior on film,is about these four friends who go on  a trip to look for a dead boy's body in the woods in the 1950's was based  on a novella by Stephen King called 'The Body' featured in the book  'Different Seasons'.  This movie features some of the best performances of  young actors ever. First of all you must let me gush about River Phoneix.  It's such a shame he had to die, he was such a wonderful actor. In this  film he played Chris, a rebellious type who everyone thinks will end up  just like all his other family, mean and stupid. But Chris is smart and  sensitive and River Phoneix plays him with such revealing honesty that it's  hard not to cry just looking at his puckered little baby face! Then there's  Will Wheaton, and I've never seen this guy in anything else, which is a  shame. He plays Gordy, who's sort of the main character because he's the  one telling the story. His older brother ( played by John Cusack ( what a  hottie! ) in flashbacks ) has just died and his parents have forgotten he's  existed. He's rather reluctant on going to look for the body. Will is such  a cutie and I'm amazed at what a great actor this guy is, whatever has  become of him! He plays this guy with depth and he ends up being your  favorite one ( besides Chris ) in the end.  The other two, Vern ( played by  Jerry O'Connel who used to be fat, look at him now! ) and Teddy played by  an overtly flamboyant Corey Feldman.  Overall this film really depicts the  classic film study of 'coming of age' well. And being a teen I can relate  to every one of these characters, even if they're boys. So pick this one  up! It's definately one of the best and most overlooked movies out there!
0440213525|5.0|Saw the movie &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; and it sent me looking for Grisham's books. Just finished this one and enjoyed it immensely: The characters were varied,well-define and a wonderful mix of adversaries and  people almost on the same side. Best was the relationship between young  Mark and his lawyer Reggie (50 year-old female - how often do you see a  heroine like that! ). You never knew what would happen next - almost to the  last page. Grisham is easy to read but his plot is by not means simple. A  great read, which I warn you might keep you up late to finish! I've just  started &quot;The Testament&quot; and it looks like it will also be a  wonderful page-turner! Enjoy!
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is difficult film to review. I expect some people will probably detest this film as too long or having a stupid ending.  But Magnolia is a very emotional film.  All of our actions have consequences.  In this film,  adults and children are living with the consequences of parents who  misplaced love with hurtful and damaging upbringings.  <br />Magnolia, for  one, is a complete movie.  The performances in the movie are wonderful.   Jon Brion's score is amazing, perhaps the most importnat aspect of the  film.  It sets the pace, and creates the mood.  Of course, we know how  wonderful Aimee Mann did on her songs.  One wonders if the movie could have  been made without her.  One must also wonder if the Academy even watched  this film, or at least listend to it.
6301008960|5.0|&quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; is a great movie because it has a great moral lesson for everybody, especially students of all ages. The main message is people should be treated equally no matter what background they  came from. It's too bad this movie is not available for purchase. If it is,  it's a must to have and for students to see. I will for sure purchase this  movie for myself and my nieces if re-released.
0887306667|5.0|Great book! and it is also a summarized version of the Marketing Classics by the same authors &quot;Positioning&quot;!  A MUST READ for any marketing manager!  GO BUY IT NOW!
B00004T9UF|5.0|It was the best c.d. ive ever heard.The best thing is theres not a lot of cause words.This c.d. inspired me to open the business i run today.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Pitt has done it again ! Pitt does it best when he plays less than normal people and scruffy looking like he did in 12 Monkeys and Legends Of The Fall. After the clean and normal Meet Joe Black this flim is a blast. The  sarcasm is loud and really at its insulting best - insulting plane crashes,  DKNY, women, children's films etc. In fact the violence makes fun of macho  male films by Van Damme and John Woo. Anyway watch out for the large  &quot;penis&quot; frame and the ghostly image of Pitt thru out the movie.  Edward Norton is great as the ever bored narrator. (watch out for the  suprise ending) and Helena is the TOTAL opposite of the goody two shoes  British la-femme in her earlier flims. She is 6 times nuttier than Mel  Gibson's Hamlet ! So for a stinging, insulting and thought provoking 2  hours +, buy this movie !
0385484518|1.0|Oh, what drivel.  I'm not sure which I resented more: Morrie's presumption that his impending death somehow imparted wisdom, or Ablom's prodigal son schtick.  I'm sorry that Morrie suffered such a long, drawn-out illness,  but that does not elevate trite sentimentalism to the realm of grand  philosophy.  Nor do I doubt Mitch's love for his teacher, or the sincerity  of his motives- I just was exhausted by his bouts of self-recrimination  interwoven with breathless awe for Morrie's wisdom.<br />I must admit that I  found myself compelled to finish the book.  I kept hoping that somehow it  would rise above the fortune cookie wisdom and deliver some real insight.   Unfortunately, I was disappointed.
0553278223|5.0|Dear Reader...     I think that the Martian Chronicles was a great book.  It is one of those stories that shows the good guys as the bad guys.  He shows this in a neat way, by having Humans invade Mars.  This is neat because Alien Invaders mostly come, in science fiction stories, from Mars  (For example Mars Attacks).  Bradbury just switched it around and had Earth  invade Mars.   Not only did he just switch it around, but he also made a  mirror and showed people how they don't care about others and just care  about ourselves (reference: June 2001).  To know what I am talking about,  you have to read the book. lol   This book is a MUST read and I suggest it  to EVERYONE!  Thanks alot for reading this review..
B00003W8NM|5.0|Wow!  The DVD Special Edition is a Gem!  The movie kept me on the edge of  my seat the first time, the second time  and yes, even the third time.   Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are a dynamic duo. Nortons monotone narration and  the overall 'Darkness' of the film just add so much to the total mood of  it.  I HIGHLY reccomend it to anyone!
B00004U2HK|5.0|An excellent family moovie with lots of beautiful songs and music.It'll warm the hearts of both old and young and will take you to the world of kindness,music,green mountains and laughter. A great moovie that will leave  you crying and laughing,stirring the best in everyone.
6305177473|5.0|This movie is my absolute favorite movie in the world. I have seen it at least 20 times. There is only one fault that I can find in it. It is a tad bit unrealistic. I mean, a couple of 11 year old's arranging for their  parents to eat dinner on a luxury boat in about two days? Yeah right. It is  a very funny movie though. My favorite part is when The father tells Anne  that he is going to get married and she starts yelling in French. It is  very funny. I think that if you have not seen this movie it is worth a try.
0684874350|3.0|This book had me rivited right from the first sentence, and I had to continue reading until I ran out of sentences! The writing style is one of gentle humour and sensitivity - couched in the terms and phrases of the  streets of Limerick. It had me crying with sorrow in some places, and  crying with laughter in others. I feel a new insight into the plight of the  poor of Limerick in the 1930s and 1940s now - a better sense of what their  priorities were, their hopes, dreams, and the harsh reality of everyday  life.  This is a very sensitive and revealing book, and I was almost  embarassed to look at the photograph of Mr McCourt at the back of the book  because I felt I knew so much about him, yet he is a total stranger. I will  always remember this book and the lives of the people therein.
B00004T9UH|1.0|okay this is a very bad cd they swear ike 50 times in 1 minute! THEY ARE HORRIBLE!  here is some advice 4 u guys out there DO NOT GET YHIS CD i would of rated it a 0 if i could. it is disgusting and very bad. And  whoever dissagrees with me send me a letter I DARE YA! unless u r to  chicken
0451160916|5.0|I don't know what to say. Great book, plot, and characters. It takes place in a hotel that a family is watching for the winter. Some weird things begin to happen and before you know it Jack Torrance is trying to kill his  family!  It starts a little slow, but picks up fast. Many scary events go  on inside this hotel, it is guaranteed to thrill you! I highly reccomend  it!
6305718954|1.0|This is an awful movie. One cliche shot after another, cobbled together to resemble an MTV video.  Oh, and then there's the evil Catholic church, resorting to murder to surpress dissent. Please. You could drive a truck  through the holes in the plot. Save your money.
B000001EYO|3.0|What about &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; during the closing credits.  Very interesting guitar parts there.  Sounds like Cheryl Crow.  Need the Tumble weeds song for sure.  This is one of my top ten films of all time!
B00000J7J4|5.0|&quot;Smooth&quot; makes this CD worth getting all in all.  Even if you aren's a Rob Thomas fan you'll love this CD.  Santana included a number of great other singers on this CD too.  They include Everlast, Eric Clapton,  Lauryn Hill, The Product G&amp;B, Wyclef, CEE LO, Dave Matthews, Eagle Eye  Cherry, and Mana.  Maria Maria is another great song, considering it has  the guitar playing of Santana combined with the singing of the Product  G&amp;B and being produced by Wyclef.  They were right in giving him so  many Grammies.  I would buy a copy if I hadn't already gotten one.  Believe  me it's worth getting.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Undoubtedly a masteripiece of Luc Besson. Location sites, storyline,  acting.....This film flows like a poem. The tableaux are magnificent....  Eric Serra outstood himself in The Big Blue. His music composition speaks  volumes about his talent.... Don't miss this film....
0380804557|5.0|It had all the elements of a great fantasy story.  It had mystery, romance, and alot of the magical other world.  Neil Gaiman made this world real and possible.  I started to be a fan with Neverwhere, and am  thoroughly hooked now.
B000002N2P|3.0|This was an OK CD. It had some good songs,(Geek Stink Breath, Brain Stew) and some OK ones and then just some I couldn't even listen to. Not a great Green Day CD.
B00003CX95|5.0|A wonderfull masterpiece, demonstarting that Mel Gibson is not only a  talented actor, but a spectacular director as well. A movie about how the  Scots raised up against the tirent English. The movie includes amazing mass  scenes and battles that I haven't seen any others on the same scale in both  size and action. The scenery of old scotlend has been captured in some  great shots, that few other movies have. I defenatly recomend it.
0060920084|2.0|I enjoyed Bryson's Walk in the Woods and recommend it frequently.  I wish I could say the same about this book.  Bryson would be the ultimate joykill on a road trip: arrogant, exceedingly negative and critical, and unable to  poke fun at himself.  Buy Walk in the Woods instead.
0671042858|3.0|This book started strong, lagged in the middle, then finished on a pretty high note. I did enjoy the story and how it was told by King, but it was just missing something needed to be a great survival story. It was not as  scary as most King novels, but it had a few moments of fear. I recommend  this story for a good short read, if you have nothing else to do.
B00000IPAX|5.0|i love every song on this cd. 10, and 11 are the best. u need to buy this cd! .
B000002UZ4|5.0|Proof, if it is needed, that the Pet Shop Boys were on the finest and most under-rated pop bands ever, this compiles singles from 'West End Girls' up until and shortly after the 'Behaviour' era (sadly, this collection  includes nothing from 'Very'). Along with New Order and the Smiths, the Pet  Shop Boys were one of a handful of unconventional, quintessentially English  indie pop acts from the '80s, although, uniquely, the Pet Shop Boys were  commercially massive, with four number one hits to date. They always seemed  to be mocking themselves, and mocking the idea of being a pop group, whilst  at the same time Neil Tennant sang lyrics that seemed, under the gloss, to  be totally sincere, emotional tales of love and loss. On 'Being Boring',  'It's Alright' and 'So Hard' they ditched the irony altogether, although by  this time everybody assumed that they did not mean what they were singing.  Still, the though of the Pet Shop Boys covering U2 is very, very  arch.<br />'Discography' is excellent - a collection of virtually all the  a-sides they released until 1992, it's a model of how to do a compilation.  The Tennant-penned sleevenotes are both informative and gently self-mocking  (take that, Paul Morley), and with 18 tracks you get a lot of music for  your money. If you also buy 'Alternative', their almost-equally interesting  b-sides collection, you have the equivalent of New Order's excellent  'Substance 1987'.
0790737345|5.0|Often critisized as a Hollywood remake of Wings of Desire, its more an updated version made in 1998. This screenpaly was also approved by the original writer/director Wim Wenders. Nicolas Cage stars as Seth an angel  who falls in love with Maggie(Meg Ryan)the cardiac surgeon he  &quot;meets&quot; while taking one of her patients.This movie has a number  of enormous strengths. Firstly, the story is interesting and plausible.  Secondly, the main characters are strong, believable and played to  perfection by Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. Thirdly, the cinematography is  absolutely stunning. There are some remarkable shots in this movie - there  is often little need for dialogue, as the stunning visual imagery tells the  entire story. Fourthly, the musical score is superb in complementing the  on-screen action.Screenplay by Dana Stevens who also wrote Blink, and For  Love of the Game, Directed by Brad Siberling (Casper)&amp; Director of  Photography John Seale (The English Patient) combine to make one of the  most emotional movies that even a hardened critic cant deny will touch you  in ways that only this special film can.  The DVD Edition is a Collectors  favourite without doubt. The film is almost reference quality presented in  a 2.35:1 Aspect Ratio, combined with 5 Audio tracks, Dolby Digital 5.1 in  English and French, a music only track , and 2 commentaries (both worth a  listen, unlike some). Other extras include a 30 min Making of Featurette,  Deleted Scenes with and without commentary, a Special Effects feature with  John Seale and 2 Music videos. This is truly a Special Edition and other  studios and directors should take note, and make this type of disc the  standard for the future.
B000002I69|5.0|I'm a teenager just getting into jazz.  I borrowed Time Out from my uncle and loved it.  I went home and found this in one of our cd drawers.  I put it on and was instantly mesmorized.  #1 and #4 are especially good.  I do  like John Coltrane a bit better, but Dave Brubeck has a place in every  decent jazz collection.
0767831071|4.0|&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; is a romance about the two main characters (Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger), but it's also a very funny comedy about a sports agent trying to survive alone away from a large corporation.   <br />Jerry is fired after writing a &quot;memo&quot; which displeases his  boss.  He is fired in a crowded place, followed by a scene where Jerry and  his boss try to contact as many of their clients as possible to convince  them to stay with one agent and not the other.  Jerry leaves with a select  few clients, some fish, and a brave secretary (Zellweger).  They eventually  begin dating after Jerry breaks up with his fiance.<br />&quot;Jerry  Maguire&quot; is an intelligent romantic comedy, not really in the same  sense that &quot;Sleepless in Seatle&quot; was a romantic comedy.  They are  completely different films, and &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; is better and  more intelligent for it.  It deals not only with the fun of relationships,  but with the hard times.  There are a few twists to the plot that come  unexpectedly and an ending that many probably will know without having seen  this movie (&quot;You complete me&quot;).  Cuba Gooding Jr. also delivers  one of his best performances (both in the film and accepting the Best  Supporting Actor award at the Oscars for this film - &quot;Show me the  money!&quot;) that has not been surpassed to date (&quot;Instinct&quot; and  &quot;Chill Factor&quot; don't even come close).<br />This widescreen version  presents the film in the original theatrical format the way it was meant to  be seen.  Yes, there are the black bars at the top and bottom of the  screen, but you actually see more of the movie (the stuff that would be  edited out for the standard format).  <br />This is a great film worth  watching many times.
0380796090|5.0|After having been on a Bridget Jones diet for quite some time now, it was nice to find some additional humor along the same vein.  Marian Keyes is very funny.  I liked the way she had Claire talk directly to the reader.   While this may be somewhat disconcerting to some readers, I felt as though  it really allowed you to connect with the character.  She uses a similar  technique in Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, which is also funny and I  highly recommend.
0140288503|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a remarkably clear, detailed account of a 24-hour streetfight between two-hundred-odd American troops and thousands of Kalashnikov-toting Somalis in the slums of Mogadishu. The US soldiers were  officially there to ensure that starving Somalis got the food hoarded by  the &quot;warlords&quot; in Mogadishu. And the Somalis, in the UN's  condescending official account, were a mass of trembling little sheep at  the mercy of the &quot;warlords&quot; and their henchmen<br />As Bowden  reveals, the official view of the two sides was almost entirely false. Both  groups were lusting for a fight, and entered this one not just willingly  but enthusiastically.  The Somalis are a warrior people, for whom   &quot;unarmed man&quot; is an oxymoron; the US Rangers who engaged them on  the streets of Mogadishu were professional soldiers, lusting for a chance  to try out their weapons in a real firefight. The fight was on, with no  quarter on either side. <br />The battle begins when a US force goes into the  slums of Mogadishu to bring back two lieutenants of the &quot;warlord&quot;  clan leader Aidid. It's the sixth time the Rangers have pulled this sort of  move, and they were successful the first five times. Not this time. A  Ranger forgets to grab the rope and falls from a helicopter within seconds,  and it's all downhill from there. <br />One of the oddest things about this  book is that many of the problems faced by the US forces are like bloodier  versions of suburban slapstick:  an officer forgets to take his headphones  off before jumping from the chopper, a convoy gets its directions mixed up  and drives around the city for hours, lost, with wounded soldiers in the  back screaming at the driver like nightmare versions of backseat-driving  mothers-in-law, while the higher-ups mangle the directions on radio.<br />The  fact that even the commanders hovering over the battle area couldn't get  their directions straight only emphasizes Bowden's achievement inmaking  this chaotic, running streetfight clear to the reader. Describing complex  action taking place in several locations at once is probably the most  difficult task a writer can undertake, and Bowden's brought it off so well  that the reader always knows who's where, who's doing what (and to whom).  It's an extraordinary display of narrative virtuosity, for which Bowden has  received far too little credit.
6303314015|5.0|This gorgeous piece of artistry re-defines why Disney remains the world's foremost animation studio.  The craftsmanship alone is awe-inspiring; add to it an enchanting mix of story, character and Hans Zimmer's lush and  moving musical score, and this film becomes a truly memorable experience.  The fable-like quality of the story, which is fascinating for adults as  well as children, is almost Biblical in its wise simplicity; smaller  children will be justifiably disturbed at one particularly vicious turn of  events.  The Elton John songs serve the film well in the long run, though  they are a distinct departure from the theatricality of Ashman/Menken  (Little Mermaid, etc.) - they are pop songs that convey emotion with  infectious rhythm, and joyful melodies.  The opening sequence, The Circle  Of Life, is one of those rare transporting experiences you have in viewing  a film that never goes away.  This movie is for everyone, everywhere.
0385495315|2.0|For the most part... it was a very interesting book. It's biggest FAILURE was not having a better understanding of 'WHAT' the mystery is really about... 'WHO' created the mystery and 'Why' it was created... 'Where' the  mystery will ultimately take you to.  Mr. Singh and others like him have no  idea that the one 'allegedly' deciphered message STILL HAS parts that have  as yet not been divulged to any one other than myself.  IF he were truly  serious about an accurate understanding of the B...eale mystery... he  should have spoken to me first.
0880389052|5.0|I absolutely loved this brilliant piece of work.  For one let me tell you that this was the first time I read one of Mr. Salvatore's books and I was absolutely blown away by the amount of detail and depth there is in this  book.  The characters are all unique in their own way and the descriptions  are all very real and vivid.  My favorite character would be Drizzt all the  way.  He has very real feelings and you feel how trapped he is in the drow  world of Menzoberranzan.  His dark kin are ruthless in their pursuit of  their dark desires and Drizzt can't comprehend how evil they are.  I would  highly recommend this book to any fantasy reader out there who enjoys a  good adventure packed book with deep characters.

0140277447|4.0|This is an extremely interesting book and it clearly describe what cruelty Chinese in Nanking is subjected to.<br />As a Chinese, I grew up listening to stories of how Chinese in China and South East Asia are tortured and killed  by the Japanese during WWII, however I was quite surprised at the lack of  articles or books on this topic. You wouldn't understand my joy when I saw  this book!<br />Japanese have always denied their cruelty and bruteness during  the WWII, they should read this book and believe that everything in this  book is true.<br />I'm looking forward to more books about Japanese's behavior  during the WWII, especially more on Japanese's cruelty to Korean!<br />I  really recommend everyone to read this book!
6305181772|5.0|Yes, this is an excellent film. And although right now M:I-2 is heating up the theatres, I will say that the first film is superior to the second. No, it doesn't have the amazing John Woo running the action, which I have to  admit is better in 2, but the overall package is better. Tom Cruise  actually LOOKS like a spy/government agent; he's got the crew cut, he's  professional and not too flashy, unlike in the sequel where it's difficult  to take him seriously. There's an actual plot, and an incredibly involving  one at that. No, you can't just try to absorb the plot, you have to think  about it. It's not hard to follow if you just pay attention. The supporting  cast is EXCELLENT, and they are actually used to good effect, unlike in  M:I-2 where Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins are merely props to propel  Cruise along his merry way. DePalma keeps the tension high almost the  entire way through with very few lapses. And as a huge Bond fan, I will say  that this movie surpasses many of the Bond films in spy entertainment. This  movie will not disappoint, unless you want to sit in front of a screen and  be spoon-fed the movie.
078062369X|5.0|I Liked it.I thought it was really well done.The special and makeup effects were pretty neat and the martial arts scenes were well cheoragraphed.Wesley Snipes played one hell of a  superhero.I liked it  alot.
B0000020C4|3.0|This recording of Les Miz was good, but not the best. Lea Salong was good (she has a beautiful voice), but she didn't portray Eponine very well. Lea didn't seem to actuaully be feeling the way Eponine was. Frances Ruffelle'  rendition was much better, then again, I don't think Frances would have  sounded very good in the part of Jasmine in Disney's Aladin. Lea was just  miss cast, that's all.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This album is a must for any music lover....it spurns every emotion ever felt by a human being and transcends them from your mind to your body....beautiful yet  tragic, ....a masterpiece.....if Dido is not famous  this time next year, I will wonder why?  Even Eminem likes her...he even  sampled 'Thankyou' on his new album, and he hates everybody!  <br />Bought  the album from hearing 'Here with you' from Roswell High and every track is  as good and better.....just the album to sit down on a warm summers night  in the company of good friends and wine!
0140131558|3.0|One can't deny the extreme originality of Paul Auster's stories. In each of them, he ostensibly challenges the blurred definition of reality and the boundary between that and what the mind tells us. The irrational quality  that permeates &quot;City of Glass&quot; defies all comprehension. I found  this story the toughest to get through. Not by its complexity but by the  monotony that eventually sets in the second half and by the ambiguous  ending. Quinn is by far one the most mind-boggling and ridiculous  characters in contemporary fiction. Likewise, the characters in  &quot;Ghosts&quot; are incredulous but it is redeemed by the interesting  premise of the watcher being watched and how the tables are eventually  turned. The most accessible is the final tale &quot;The Locked Room&quot;.  The writer is constantly haunted by the memory of his best friend whose  life he has inadvertantly taken over and is finally driven to discover the  truth in a painful journey into the friend's past. Besides the depth of  characterisation, it also cleverly incorporates the themes in the other  stories (both expressed and implied).
0446525537|1.0|A Walk to Remember is a poorly written, incredibly predictable novel.  I was honestly surprised by the number of positive reviews that it received here.  I have read Nicholas Sparks's other two novels and don't recall  being so disappointed.  Had I not known the author, I really would have  supposed this to be the work of a high school student.  <br />I am a romantic  too, but there is so much more out there better to read-more heart-warming,  more touching, more satisfying.  I would not recommend reading this novel.
B000021XS0|1.0|my friend made me sit and listen to this whole cd several timesthrough.  i don't understand how people can give this drivel 5 stars.i'd give it zero stars, except they don't let me.  it's sooo lame. anyway, save your money and buy something else, anything, it'll be worth it.
0312853238|5.0|I don't read science fiction, but this book isn't really science fiction.  Ender's Game is a book that makes anyone who reads it evaluate their own lives and the lives of their children.<br />Ender is a child genius who is  trained to become the next great commander in the war against the aliens,  or &quot;buggers&quot;.  Ender goes to Battle School and learns war  tactics, while the teachers isolate him and allow all other boys to tease,  hurt, and humiliate him.  Ender is forced to rely only on himself.  Ender  is then graduated to Command School, where he learns strategy and how to  command the forces, not actually being the forces.  The end of this book is  surprising, and I am not going to reveal it.  Read the book Ender's Game,  and you will be knocked for a loop.<br />This book makes you think, something  that most books rarely do.  Thank you, Orson Scott Card, for writing such a  deep work.  I look forward to reading the next books.
0793518326|5.0|Hello! I'm Cristina, from Argentina, I've read the book and I think it's great. I play the drums and here it's really difficult to find books that have the drum's part. As I'm a big fan of The Beatles, this book was like a  dream come true. I find it very complete, and easy to understand, although  it's not written in the way I'm used to read music.  I think it is a good  option for people like me.
6305508550|5.0|I was one of the few people to actually see this movie in thetheatres, and I bought it on DVD as well.  Jennifer Anniston is theonly &quot;star&quot; in the film, however that doesn't at all hinder it.  One of the funniest character developing comedies, nearly everyone in the cast gets at least one humorous line, and there are plenty to go around.  While the ending is sort of predictable, the plot isn't that important annyway.  What counts in the humor and entertainment. [...] At least rent this film, or &quot;I'll set the building on fire.&quot;
B000000993|4.0|I have had &quot;Aemina&quot; for 3 years know, and never got the chance or modavation to get &quot;Undertow&quot;. Well I got &quot;Mer de noms&quot; from A perfect circle and it got me back into tool. I rebought  &quot;Aemina&quot; and bought &quot;Undertow&quot;. Well I tell you  everything about this album is heavly showdoed by &quot;Aemina&quot;.  &quot;Aemina&quot; has amazing vocals and lryics from Maynard Keenen. Well  lryically this album is great but his voice dosent compare. The songs here  start out great and then leave you hanging wondering what happened to the  asome opening riff. Thats the num 1 reason I dident give this 5 stars.  Still 1000 times better than other records out there, but just dosent cut  it from a tool's fans point of view. The chorus sometimes ruins the song  ala &quot;Swamp song&quot;. But there are some classics on here like  &quot;Prison sex&quot;. &quot;Intolerence&quot;, &quot;Sober&quot;,  &quot;Crawl away&quot;, &quot;Bottom&quot; &quot;Undertow&quot;,  &quot;Flood&quot; and &quot;4 Degrees&quot;. I maybe shouldent have put  &quot;Undertow&quot; and &quot;Bottom&quot; cause well they relly dritft on  in the middle but they pick up at the end
B00004RHZU|4.0|I just recently purchased P!NK's Album and I must say, it's really cool!  I was unsure about buying it because I only knew &quot;There U Go&quot; and I did love it and still do, but I didn't know if I'd like an  album with that kind of style for every song.  Well, I do!  I love most of  the songs, and some are just ok, thats why I only gave it 4 stars.  P!NK  has a lot of attitude and it shows which is cool!  My favorite songs is  &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot; &quot;Hell wit ya&quot; and &quot;Most  Girls&quot;  buy this album, if u like &quot;There U Go&quot; you'll like  this album.
B00004T37E|4.0|Sleepy Hollow was an awesome movie. If you ever heard the Tale of Sleepy Hollow growing up then you must see this movie. This story about the Headless Horseman terrorizing the people of a small time village is both  attention-grabbing and frightening. The actors, directors, and  scriptwriters did an amazing job of portraying the tale of sleepy hollow in  a different fashion.  Its the same basic tale but with a few new twists  that make it as great as possible. A word to the wise however,  the amount  of blood shed in the film is vast.  If you're queasy, make sure you're  prepared to close those eyes tight!  Nonetheless, the film is perfect for  young and old, well, not too young!
B000001IPP|5.0|You won't believe how fast you will come to love this album- after the first song, you will be head banging and begging for more.
0783240503|5.0|Joseph is an excellent movie!I've watched it 1000000000000 times and I love it! It's about Joseph(Donny Osmond)who is adored by his father the most out of his other 11 brothers. Jacob(Richard Attenborough) buys Joseph  a multi coloured coat which makes his brothers jealous. The brothers plan  to get rid of Joseph. They put him in a well but then change their minds  when some Ishmaelites buy JOseph instead. Joseph is then bought by  Potiphar, one of Egypt's millionaires and ownes Joseph as a slave.  Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph but gets caught by Potiphar.  Potiphar gets angry then throws Joseph in jail. After that, two of  Pharoah's men are put in jail. Those two men had dreams they didn't  understand so they told them to Joseph and he interpreted them. The  butler's dream meant that he would be released but the baker would not.  When the butler is free he tells Pharoah that he knows this guy in jail who  can tell you what your dreams mean because Pharoah had a dream he did not  understand. Joseph comes and tells Pharoah what his dream means. It means  ther will be lots of food for 7 years but after that there will be 7 years  of famine. Joseph tells Pharoah that he needs to find a man to lead him  through the famine. That man is Joseph. During the years of the famine the  brothers forget that they sold Joseph and now think he is dead, but he  isn't. They hear that Egypt has a lot of food so they go to Egypt not  knowing that Joseph was the leader of the food. They asked for food and so  they got food. When they were eating Joseph put his golden cup in  Benjamin's sack because Joseph wanted to know if his brothers were now  honest men. It turned out that, yes, they are. Joseph renited them at last.  Jacob came to Egypt and that is the ending. It's a reallllllllly good movie
B00004SX0T|4.0|This cd is okay. But with the data track, it crashes my computer a few times before it works on my computer. But it includes Videos and 2 versions of Break Stuff. Otherwise, no different from the U.S cd. This really isnt  as good as the first album, three dollar bill yall$. The music is a little  softer this time, and there is more rap in it.
B000007VLL|5.0|This collection features the songs that many of Bonnie's fans consider to be her strongest. Among them, &quot;Total Eclipse Of The Heart&quot;, &quot;If You Were A Woman (And I Was A Man)&quot;, &quot;Lovers Again&quot;  and &quot;Holding Out For A Hero.&quot; Although the bulk of the material  here comes from her three albums on Columbia Records, the disc also  features &quot;It's A Heartache&quot;, &quot;Lost In France&quot;,  &quot;Married Men&quot;, and the beautiful &quot;More Than A Lover&quot;,  from her RCA albums. The hard to find single versions of many of the songs  here, as well as the rare remix of &quot;Save Up All Your Tears&quot;,  makes this highly desirable to Bonnie's biggest fans. Also of note is  &quot;A Rockin' Good Way (To Mess Around And Fall In Love)&quot;, a fun  duet with '50's loyalist Shakin' Stevens, which never appeared on any of  Bonnie's albums. This compilation was also released under the title 'The  Definitive Collection', which comes with a second, 5-track disc, featuring  the original full-length versions of a few of the tunes found here.
B000009QPE|1.0|First of all, I wish that I had the option of giving this album zero stars, because that is what it deserves.  The problem with this album is that it simply isn't evil enough.  Admittedly, some of the music from this  album is decent, namely, the entertaing angel of death, on which Kerry  King's harmonious guitar work really shines.  However, its corny lyrics are  a weak attempt at being evil.  Mr. King and Company should have taken a few  lessons from the masters of evildom, like Rush, Neil Young, and Pink Floyd,  which could have helped make this album halfway tolerable.
B000003TA4|5.0|Since Nirvana is my all time favorite band, it isn't hard to say good things about their CD, Nevermind.  Nevermind is better than In Utero to me.  If you would like to but a Nrivana CD, start with Nevermind.  The songs  are a viriaty of Rock and even some slow.  In Utero is more jst screaming  and Kurt Cobain sounds like he's ready to give up on life.  This is a  fantastic album.
B00003CWTH|4.0|&quot;Magnolia&quot; Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up to &quot;Boogie  Nights&quot; has another extravagant cast.  William H. Macy, Juliane Moore,  and Tom Cruise are the biggest of the names but Anderson's works aren't  about &quot;selling&quot;.  He doesn't use the names of big stars like  Cruise to promote the film to be a hit.  This is an intelligent story of  love, loss, confusion and many other juicy storylines that everyone loves.   Aimee Mann provides nine songs to the film and soundtrack including the  Academy Award nominated &quot;Save Me&quot;.  &quot;Wise Up&quot; is  featured in the casts &quot;sing-a-long&quot; scene.  Tom Cruise's role as  the male dominate sex machine will offend many but it is wonderful acting  reguardless.  This is a bold film that will be enjoyed by many (the one's  that don't mind three hour movies) and will be hated by many (people that  &quot;don't get it&quot;).  For those that &quot;don't get it&quot;, the  theme is simple, be loving to your children because they need you and  you'll need them.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Signifigant Other is a great CD if you like screaming, cussing, and talking about killing and dying.  The thing is, the message you get when you listen to this CD is appaling.  Do you really want to hear how the  singer wants to stab someone in the back?  Well, if you do, enjoy this CD.   It has very catchy tunes.
B0000027F3|5.0|I like metal a lot, but nothing else is like this - Painkiller contains absolutely the greatest music I've heard in my life. After having listened to it thousands of times (literally) I still can't stop myself from jumping  all around; this album has 9 WONDERFUL songs, Priest could have made 5  albums out of these songs but no - they are all in one materpiece. The  thing that drives me crazy are those dark melodies built into fast,heavy  songs... I could be writing for hours, cos this is the ONE !
B000009ED0|5.0|Devil Without A cause is a rockin' CD.  The singer has talent, and the songs are very catchy.  It may sound similar to Limp Bizkit to some people but Kid Rock has a style of its own.  Of course, some people may complain  that the group sound more like &quot;Black Rap coppycatters.&quot; I might  have to agree on that.  Anyway, the CD is good, if you like rap, you'll  like this.
6305922748|5.0|This is an absolutely hilarious movie. This is a documentary on a british band called Spinal Tap. This band has never been very big in America, and they are not very bright, either. Half the vidio is clips of their playing,  and the other half is interviews of the band. What makes this so funny is  that this band is very unfortunate. Not only are they a little slow, but  their drummers keep dying (one of a tragic gardening accident, another  spontaniously combusts). They also run into a series of problems, like  losing their way back stage and not able to find the stage. I highly  recommend this to any garage band. It is also a large spoof on bands such  as the Beastles and Led Zeppelin. Buy it!
1563523302|5.0|This book is a cut above most 'how to get rich' books, because it is empirical, research-driven analysis of the habits of American millionaires, done over the period from 1973 to just before publication.  The authors  look at the petit millionaires, not the super-rich, so as to examine the  habits of those whose wealth level is achievable in a lifetime.  The habits  of the group, consisting of those with between $1 and $10 million in  assets, reveals that the 'magic' formula is to work hard, not stay in  college forever, go into business for yourself, if possible, and live below  your means.  I'm not at all sure that this wouldn't be the advice of  someone who had survived the Great Depression in good shape, but the  authors back it up with hard statistical data.  Living on less than you  earn, staying away from status items, and building wealth over time are  three of the keys identified by the authors.  Reading this book reminded me  again that America is truly the land of opportunity, and that an individual  can become wealthy without going to a prestige university, earning a high  income, having connections, etc; in other words, the American Dream lives,  and those who fail to achieve it frequently have no one but themselves to  blame, especially now that this roadmap is available.

6300216268|5.0|I loved this movie. I guess this is more of a question than a review, where can I buy the soundtrack? I've had the theme song in my head for days...
0375703764|4.0|While an excellent book, and a truly awesome work of literature, &quot;House of Leaves&quot; should not be attempted by anyone who is not willing to give reading it a pretty supreme effort. However, any one who  has plenty of time and determination (and imagination) will be amazed by  this book. <br />I admitt, &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is trying sometimes.  The footnotes everyone is complaining about are sometimes helpful, and  sometimes nothing but annoying. Some people complained that the odd layout  of the book is obnoxious. While indeed I was getting strange looks from my  family as I turned the book over, flipped it upside-down, diagonally, and  went rapidly through sections that had only one word per page, that's all  part of the fun . . .<br />There's a lot of unneeded parts to this book,  certainly, and there's no real end to the thing. All I can say is that if  you have lots of time on your hands, read this book. I know it has changed  the way I look at most literature. It has also changed the way I look at  the absence of light, and it will be a long time before I walk down any  more unknown hallways in the dark.
B00001OH7V|4.0|\\"Heroes\\" contains some of David Bowie's best music.  It was recorded when his voice was at its absolute strongest, his writing was most creative, and his collaboration (with Brian Eno) most productive.  It is an improvement  on the innovative and very good \\"Low,\\" and is the middle of three very good  albums (the third being \\"Lodger\\") which are collectively known as the  \\"Berlin Trilogy.\\"  Still, \\"Heroes,\\" like the other albums of the trilogy,  is flawed.<br />I have often read or heard that Bowie would have had his best  album if he added the vocal tracks of \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Low\\" together without  the instrumentals.   Actually, such an album would still be a bit short.   The best songs off \\"Lodger\\" would need to be added.  As it is, side one of  \\"Heroes\\" is excellent.   The problem is with side two.<br />Like side two of  \\"Low,\\" the second half of \\"Heroes\\" (there are no sides on CD) is almost  entirely instrumental.  One or two instrumentals, such as the energetic  \\"V-2 Schneider,\\" would be fine, but a whole side is too much.  I understand  that in 1977 the heavy use of the synthesizer as instrument was  groundbreaking.  While I respect the historical significance, the  instrumentals are simply not as enjoyable to listen to as the vocal songs.   Besides, the vocal songs also employ innovative uses of the synthesizer.   <br />Side two is \\"saved\\" by \\"The Secret Life of Arabia,\\" the final song  (unless you have the Rykodisk version, which has useless bonus tracks).  \\"Secret Life\\" is one of the three great songs of the album, along with  \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Blackout.\\"  The title song, \\"Heroes,\\" is more  popular, but it is fairly straightforward and not as enduring as the other  three.  Bowie's voice is loud and very desperate on all the songs.  It  really never sounds better, which is why its absence on the instrumental  tracks is all the more lamentable.  He even sounds good singing nonsense,  as in \\"Joe the Lion\\" and \\"Sons of the Silent Age,\\" which, as far as I can  figure, are not really about anything at all.  I almost feel that music  that good deserves better lyrics, but I think Bowie's trying to make a  point that the lyrics are secondary to the music. \\"Secret Life\\" is also  nonsense, but the nonsense words flow together with the music and the sound  of Bowie's voice exceedingly well.<br />\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is about  something.  After listening to it probably hundreds of times (it is that  good), I'm pretty sure that its about adultery.  The mystery of Bowie's  lyrics is part of the fun.  Figuring them out is added incentive to listen  again.  <br />\\"Blackout\\" is the album's second most coherent song (next to the  title track) and seems to work on two levels.  Like \\"Space Oddity,\\" it is  about drugs and something else.    The drugs part (or maybe alcohol) is a  substance-induced \\"blackout.\\"  The \\"other\\" part is an urban blackout.   Either way, the song is full of confusion and disorientation. Is the  confusion internal or external?  Either way it is equally frightening and  intense.<br />Intensity marks \\"Heroes,\\" although some of the instrumentals,  starting with \\"Sense of Doubt\\" ease put the breaks on the intensity.  The  full potential of this phase of Bowie's career is finally met with the  masterful \\"Scary Monsters.\\"<br />The minimalist composer Philip Glass based  his \\"Heroes Symphony\\" on some of the music from this album.  That, and his  \\"Low Symphony\\" are the realization of the logical second step in the  fantasy album combining the vocal songs from \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Low\\" - a  combination of the instrumental tracks would still be worthy, in a low key,  ambient sort of way.  <br />Despite its flaws, \\"Heroes\\" remains very worthy  and definitely one of Bowie's ten best.
0441172717|5.0|The first time reading this novel, I started with the historical appendix.  I directed every single moment in my mind as if it was a cross between some great film and an alternate hyper-reality.  Each conversation, action,  and scene description played out in nearly real time.  If a scene was set  up incorrectly or otherwise did not play out exactly as it should, I'd  reread and meditate over the passage or pages again until it was flawless.  There were moments when the beauty and grandeur of a scene would bring  tears to my eyes, such as when Doctor Yueh made his way along the path of  burning palm trees to the ornithopter in one last redeeming gesture.  There  is no way a film could adequately capture the glory of this work of art.  Even a 10 hour, $150 million HBO miniseries would only begin to do it  justice.  That first reading still stands as one of the greatest literary  experiences of my life.  I know most people don't have the time to  experience it as I did, but Dune is a journey I highly recommend - even if  it's by speed-reading.
B00003CX5P|5.0|There has been so much criticism of this movie it makes me sick.  People are nitpiking over the smallest things.  Lets examine.  <br />1) The biggest of all complaints is Jar Jar Binks.  The complaint is that he's just not funny and I completely agree with this except I don't think he was supposed  to be funny.  His Juvenile pranks are just in Character with his species,  which is a lower inteligence.  We all know that when kids are young they do  dumb stuff that they think is funny, but really is not.  Another complaint  about him is that his dialect is supposedly racist.  I can see why people  thought this.  In Hollywood a while back black people were portrayed with a  similar dialect.  Thats because in the eyes of the racist white Hollywood  bigwigs black were of a lower inteligence.  Now when George Lucas was  devolping the Jar Jar Character he had to devolp dialoge which would show  the character being of lower inteligence.  As a resolt, the two dialects  turned out be similiar. If Lucas is being racist in this movie at all its  to the Gungan race.  <br />2)Another complaint about it was that there wasn't  enought character development.  This would be true if this was a complete  story, on it's own, but it's not.  It's the first of a Trilogy.  Thats like  reading 1/3 of a book and complaining that the characters weren't developed  enough.  You have to read the whole book before you can decide that.<br />3.  The Plot is too confusing!  Thats the worst complaint i've ever heard.  If  you are unable to understand the plot of a movie thats rated PG then your  in troupble.  I can name about five 8 year olds right now who could give  you a plot sumarary, an analysis, and the foreshadowing involved.  And if  it was a little complecated I don't recall anybody whining about how  &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; or &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; were too  confusing.  <br />Well I could go forever about all the other unfair nitpicks  that have fallen on to this movie from criticsthat don't have any sort of  imagination at all, but I won't because I think I've hit the big ones.  But  please send your nit picks about this movie to me and i'll answer you with  a logical explanation to why they are hollow.  I think this is a tactic  (the ability to think logically) which most critics should start using more  before they attack a movie....
B00000JCB2|2.0|This is just my opinion, and I must be honest as my conscience dictates...if you're reading this I hope you're mature enough to respect that. <br />Ok, forget the comparisons to earlier albums, the debate on  combining genres like rap and metal, or how &quot;hot&quot; the band  members are...and let's evaluate what we're all here for...the  MUSIC.<br />People, dress it up however you want with scratching, great  production values, studio effects and trickery and tons of guest  appearances...two chords and superficial music can't be disguised. And  that's exactly what this is. Downtune the guitars and write threatening,  bad-boy lyrics...it does wonders for your image but can't save the music.  <br />The music on this album is elementary, basic and lacking substance. You  have 2-3 chords in each song and endless variations of the same song  structure or musical (?) idea and rhythm over and over. The songs are, for  the most part, tuneless and lacking song structure beyond the now  hugely-popular &quot;breakdown soft verse followed by a wall-of-noise  chorus&quot;. No key changes, no meaningful progressions, no emotion or  expressions (beyond rage and testosterone) or significant technical  ability. I just don't hear it. <br />And I hate to say this...but Fred Durst  cannot rap. I won't go into his singing -- it's immensely lacking but  that's accepted nowadays as long as you can whisper and then scream -- but  Fred's rapping is inane and for the most part shows his lack of experience,  wit or depth. Method Man completely blasts Fred off the map. It's a noble  idea to want to combine genres -- we need more of that type of  experimentation -- but you'd better make sure you excel - or are at least  PROFICIENT - in all the genres you try your hand at. <br />The only  salvageable thing about this band is the rhythm section...the bassist has  good melodic ideas and holds down a pulsing meter...and John Otto, while  not a genius, puts out a strong groove, displays a knack for tasty fills  and good syncopations, and carries this band at times.<br />Why two stars?  Well, some of the songs do groove...and are an adequate channel for  expressing rage, frustration or angst. The problem is the WHOLE album is  like this...and it sounds contrived and pretentious. ANd when it's not  that, it's testosterone-drenched lyrical drivel about sexual exploits or  wanting to hurt someone, or how the band is &quot;da bomb&quot;...all  immature, superficial, and worse...unoriginal. It's been done  before.<br />Kudos, at least, for getting some grooves right...and daring to  experiment with songs like &quot;Rearranged&quot; and &quot;Don't Go Off  Wandering&quot;. <br />I do like some funk/rap/metal...when it's done right  (I've been a fan since the Faith No More days, for all you kiddies). I also  am into hardcore (Earth Crisis, No Innocent Victim, Vision of Disorder,  Madball, etc.). I'm pretty open-minded on genres and styles....but  unfortunately, Limp Bizkit's &quot;Significant Other&quot; doesn't deliver  on either.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I'm still left to wonder how Britney really made it. But hey the public must like her if she sold millions of albums.  Oops... did it again is kind of cute but the ballad &quot;don't let me be the last to know&quot; is a  waste of voice for her.  Shania is and excellent song writer and Britney  just doesn't have the voice to carry the song out the way it should be.   We'll see how long this one lasts....
6302038324|5.0|I was intrigued the first time I saw this strange film.  I have always been fascinated by the life of Mary Shelley and that is what drew me to see it.  I was impressed by all of the symbolism, forshadowing and how the  concepts of the story parallel the works of these famous people.  I have  watched it many times and I still keep finding things I didn't quite  understand the time before.  I believe the problem most people have with  this movie is they do not understand most of the symbolism.  It is a bit  overwhelming at times, and I have never found anyone of my friends who has  actually admitted to liking it, but I think it is an erotic and powerful  movie that truely captures the essence of that time and shows a darker side  of the romantic era.
B000003CUJ|3.0|I think the opera is great, I went and saw the four day opera in Sanfransico, and it ws really good. The only reason i bought this CD was because I never got to just hear the music, and that is part of enjoying  anything that has music. I have to say that this CD is one of my favorites,  it and Holst, The Planets. I fact at the next concert that I'm in we're  doing a version of Das Reingold: Float Up To The Home Of The Gods, at my  request of course. If you like the Opera you'll like this CD. And if you  don't then you won't ever know that full Beauty of the Opera.

B00004TH7Z|1.0|I never really liked the hair bands, but iron maiden has to be the worst of the bunch.This album, much like all of their others, are just plain dull and boring. If you think 'load' from metallica is bad listen to this and  you will change yor mind. At least metallica has gotten better since then.  If you like britney spears and the backstreet boys, you miight like this  album.Don't worry pantera or metallica, this isn't much of a threat.  Hopefully ths will be the last cd released by the kings of &quot;cheese,  pop metal&quot;
B000000WA4|5.0|I am always surprised when I meet someone who does not like the Smashing Pumpkins and am convinced that it is only because they have just not listened enough to them. And MCATIS is one of the best albums of the 90s,  along with &quot;The Bends&quot; and Lives &quot;Throwing Copper&quot;.  You can listen to it in one sitting (provided you have a couple of hours to  spare) or choose a song appropriate to your mood. I have been listening to  this album since I bought it a few years ago and will continue to do so  until my coffin is nailed shut. If I could choose only one cd to take to a  deserted island it would definetly be this one.
B000002J03|1.0|This band is like a bad dream. Every time you turn on the radio there they are. No other band gets as much airplay. Also, is it just me, or is their music not actually very good? I like hard rock but I've never understood  the appeal of this band; violently average songs with bad singing. I've  stopped listening to the radio because of them. Every time I hear Plant  whine in his high pitched voice &quot;it's just a spring clean for the May  queen&quot; the only cure I know is to put on my headphones and listen to  the Ozzy Black Sabbath( that tolling bell, the thunder and rain and then  that first mighty power chord! My God it's bliss.)
B000001ELP|3.0|(Music from)The Elder may not be KISS best album.     But it does feature some of their best writing to date. Songs like A World Without Heroes displays Gene's displeasures because of the worlds lack of positive role models. I,of course is their best recorded as well as written song to date because it encourages self belief without being overly preachy or haughty.It also educates people to shy from chemical abuse (i.e. Don't need to get wasted.It only holds me down.) and fanatic materialism (i.e.I don't need no money.I don't need no thing.)       Musically,there are a few surprises. Songs like Just A Boy,Only You and Under The Rose bring to mind influences of Jethro Tull,King Crimsom and Pink Floyd.Dark Light is where  Yes meets Emerson,Lake & Palmer(Lyrically it's Yes.Musically it's Emerson,Lake & Palmer). The opening orchestral Fanfare is reminescent of John Williams. Odyssey has some great Rick Wakeman styled piano playing and instrumentation.    Bob Ezrin and Kiss show a very admirable change in direction artistically.It shows that the band is capaple of writing more than songs about dirty sex,parties,groupies and picking up girls.     They actually created a Modern Rock Masterpiece that should be turned into a Broadway musical.     While not the best,it is still a very good album that no Kiss fan should be without.
B000005K65|2.0|Another violently average album from arguably the most overrated band of all time. Don't believe all the hype about this band. They're like U2 ; a few good songs but the rest is just nothing special. The singing is just  awful.
B00004SX0T|5.0|When I first got the Significant Other cd I thought that nothing would ever top it.  Then I bought this one seeing it had music videos on it.  I bought it and it was like MTV on my computer.  I love this one more that  Significant Other and I think that everyone should have a copy.
B000002U82|2.0|I would like to provide some thought-provoking feedback on the eternal Pink Floyd vs Led Zeppelin debate. Here it is. I think they both stink.They are simply two of the most overrated bands of all time. They're mainly  listened to by people in high school and university who just want to seem  cool and trendy.Believe me folks I know from experience- I'm now thirty and  have experienced it at first hand. I too listened to Pink Floyd and Led  Zeppelin ( although I never really liked either of them) and discussed with  my friends the merits of their particular albums, thinking I was really  cool.I can't think back on those times without blushing like mad and giving  an embarrassed groan.Yes I'm still very much into classic rock (70's  Sabbath, Who ,Beatles, Queen, Rush etc.) but I firmly believe that the  popularity of Floyd and Zeppelin is simply image. Sure, they both wrote a  few good songs and I admit that they were both influential, but I feel that  neither of them deserve their godlike status
0767802659|5.0|This is a briliant view of what the future should be like. A one world government with Vetran rule. Earn the right to vote. A common enemy to focus energies at. Yes, this is a true vision of a perfect world. If you  liked the book, you will love the movie. Even though the book is a  different animal.
B000002U82|2.0|Don't believe all the hype about this album. Sure ,it's got some good songs on it, but  a lot of it is just something you'd want to put on for background music-it's not something you can actually &quot;listen&quot; to  attentively.I'm sure it sounds great when you're stoned but for a square  person like me who doesn't take drugs much of the album is simply boring.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I own and have watched this movie many times.  I came on here to look at some peoples views and comments about Life Is Beautiful.  I was troubled a with couple reviews.  The movie is terrific, about an hour into it (after  seeing it already and knowing what comes next) my heart always seems  troubled.  The movie is going along so happily, and the joy on Roberto and  Nicoletta's (what a beautiful name) faces excite you.  And then the plot  thickens to the end.  Even during the troubling (I guess you can say sad  parts) of the movie you still feel good for some reason.  There are no  words to encourage someone to see this movie, you just simply should.   There is a pretty good reason this movie won so many international awards  (I want to say 60+, but it could be 30).   Watch this movie in peace and  pay attention (to the color, screenplay...well everything).  Just pay  attention.  I found the movie very creative.  It is unlike other movies  dealing with this topic in that it is very non-violent, and more about a  man trying to protect and live life with his family as it was and much  more.      Now for the comments I have about other peoples comments...  First, I would recommend (if you are going to buy it) buying a DVD player,  and purchasing this on DVD. Second, WATCH THIS MOVIE IN ITALIAN with  subtitles.  Do NOT watch this dubbed!  You will never get the true feeling  Roberto and the others (well especially Roberto) throw at you.  I guess you  can compare it to Listening to your 12 year old son/daughter play  Beethoven, instead of Beethoven playing Beethoven!  Get my point?  After  that if you must, watch it again in the &quot;boring&quot; dubbed version.   But it will truly not be the same.  Your eyes get used to reading and  watching the movie at the same time.  I have seen the movie plenty of  times, and I really think I am learning Italian because of the joy of the  real voices in the movie.  If you watch the subtitled version, it just  feels real...and you can almost know what they are saying without  reading...I think that is just your EYES ADJUSTING!  So please, for your  sake, watch the movie in Italian with subtitles and not dubbed.  I hope you  enjoy a wonderful movie.  Roberto is truly a great and kind man, society  could learn a lot from people like him.   BONJOURNO PRESHA-PRISHA! ...(I  know I cant spell it, but you get the drift)     :)
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This is by far the most amazing CD ever recorded. I hasn't left my CD player since November. Her voice is beautiful, the lyrics are brilliant and the piano parts (which she composes herself) send chills up my spine. Each  song is so moving and as you are listening to them you feel her emotion and  pain. She sings my life with every lyric. It's almost too much beauty for  me to handle.
B00003IQN1|4.0|The mid 1980's were not a particularly good time for CD hungry Beatlefans. The actual Beatle recordings would not appear on CD until 1987, and the solo Beatle product avaivalbe was limited, at best. Paul McCartney, who was  under contract with Columbia Records at the time, was fortunate enough to  see much of his solo catalog released on CD before most Lennon, Harrison,  &amp; Starr material was remastered for the &quot;new&quot; digital medium.  One of the first Macca CD's Columbia released was a 2 disc version of  &quot;Wings Over America.&quot; Beatlefans were initially overjoyed to have  2 CD's of McCartney's best &quot;live&quot; solo and Beatles material.  Many, however, were disappointed to find that the sound quality left  something to be desired. <br />When Paul took his catalog back to Capitol  several years later, the hope was that new remastering would improve the  muddy, hissy sound quality of Columbia's releases. Unfortunately, on  Capitol's new &quot;Wings Over America,&quot; there was little to no  improvement. By the early 1990's, Parlophone/EMI in Europe again remastered  Paul's solo catalog, and for the first time, there was finally dramatic  improvement over the earlier 2 sets of reissues. However, a new &quot;Wings  Over America&quot; was inexplicably left out of the &quot;Paul McCartney  Collection&quot; catalog. <br />That's all been remedied by the title's entry  into EMI Japan's recent &quot;deluxe&quot; McCartney remasters, which  present his catalog in replica LP sleeves and remarkable sound. &quot;Wings  Over America&quot; has returned to its' album format, and is now spread out  over 3 CD's. The sound is clear, bright, and a major improvement over the  earlier CD incarnations. The original album graphics (including a great  mini-poster) are included, making this the definitive CD edition of his  greatest &quot;officially released&quot; live work. If only Capitol would  catch on here in the states and give Paul McCartney's underrated solocatalog the respect it deserves, perhaps one wouldn't have to spend nearly  $80 on the third pressing of this title. Since it looks like that may never  happen, this Japanese import is more than worth the investment. All of the  new Japanese remasters are worth checking out, but this one is essential  for McCartney and Beatles fans.
630407185X|5.0|This was the last great WWII epic that we saw until 1998. Nothing after 1977 came out that was this big and this good. Very underrated film about the Airborne invasion of Holland during the fall of 1944. This film shows  in great detail the most disastrous battle for the Americans and British of  the war. It was also good to see the Polish unit in there as well! Not  knowing that they had just landed in the same area where several SS Panzer  outfits are located, it took nine days to get things together and only then  did they re-treat! Very Historically Accurate to both the book and the real  battle. This is a great film and was the most realistic up to it's time!   Grade:A-
B00000ILE7|2.0|This movie has a lot of flaws in it, first of all killing off everyone that survived the previous movie shows a lack of imagination not to mention that it spoils the ending of ALIENS.  I thought that the way the designed  the alien itself was inventive, I like the way it took on the  characteristics of the dog and how it could run on walls.  The whole story  about the bald-headed prisoners who were suposed to be some kind of munks  was wierd and confusing.  The movie drags until you get to the last  half-hour and even then its mostly everyone just running around.

0385474547|3.0|This is another classic example of &quot;what in the world are you thinking assigning this to high school kids?&quot; It's a pretty durned fine book, and there is much therein upon which to reflect, but I'm  guessing the adolescent and recently-postadolescent crowd is going to feel  a book like this is being rammed down their throats. And they're probably  right.<br /><br />Thankfully, I'm a year or so too old to have been assigned  this in school, and I picked up a copy vaguely remembering classmates below  me had had to read it. Perhaps my lack of memory about much of my high  school and college days is a good thing, because I went into this novel  without any preconceptions. I also went into it having read a few books  from Heinemann's African Writers Series over the past few months, so I have  something of a grasp on what African novelists were doing in the late  fifties. (Not a bad idea, actually, since the &quot;storytelling&quot;  nature of such tales can be jarring to someone who's used to modern  American lit-- for example, your typical high school student.) All this  being the case, Things Fall Apart, considered by many western critics to be  the premier work of African literature of this century, may be quite  deserving of its laurels.<br /><br />Okonkwo is a tribal elder in Umuofia, a  large village in southern Nigeria. He's the very essence of a self-made  man, having inherited nothing from his father. Of course, events can't just  go on day to day as we want them to, and a series of stumbling blocks face  Okonkwo after he is given the care of a teenager the village has taken as a  spoil of war.<br /><br />The book is compared to classical Greek tragedy, and  there are certainly elements of it here. However (remembering recent  reading in Abel), to cast this as a true Greek tragedy would force a  reading that says the tribal gods sent Christian missionaries to Umuofia in  order to punish Okonkwo for various transgressions. I'm about halfway to  accepting that this is what Achebe was after, actually. Otherwise, one is  forced to read this in kind of the same way as the old joke whose punchine  is &quot;Job, something about you just sporks me off.&quot;<br /><br />One way  or the other, the writing is fluid, easy, and captivating, and the  storytelling style is one I've always been drawn to (as opposed to the  missionaries-- one white person, at the very end of the book, thinks to  himself that one of the most annoying things about the tribe is their  &quot;superfluity&quot;). I liked this one, surely more than my schoolmates  who were assigned it. Those of you who were, and hated it, might want to  try cleansing your palates with something by, say, Cyprian Ekwensi, or a  different, lesser-known book by Achebe (A Man of the People would be a good  start). Then tackle this one again. It's worth it.ting that this is what Achebe was after, actually.

It's not Adam's best (Wedding Singer), or funniest (Happy Gilmore), but it sure  is a hell of a great movie.  <br />It's a story of a waterboy for a football team who starts playing fooball for the team.   He's great.  But he has to pass an exam to make it into college before he  can play the championship game...<br />I don't want to tell you the rest.

0345377370|5.0|If one is to read only one spy story and certainly only one Cold War novel, that story is The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.  LeCarre established himself with this one novel as not only a popular writer but  also one of the best novelists of the second half of the 20th century.<br />In  LeCarre's spy world, secret weapons and glamorous action are not present.  The Spy Who Came in From the Cold is full of twists, turns and betrayal.   It presents seamy people living seamy lives without ideals, just playing a  deadly game to win at all costs.  Spying is like a giant chess game in  which the players can very quickly become the pieces and become discarded  when they have lost their value.<br />The novel features Alec Leamus, a middle  aged spy who wants to come in from the cold.  That is to say he wants to  stop spying.  He is persuaded to accept one more mission to discredit the  East German who has been catching all his agents..  He must pretend to sink  into alcoholism and eventually defect.  What follows are the twists, turns  and betrayal that are stock LeCarre.<br />The presence of George Smiley is  felt throughout much of the novel.  The protagonist of Call for the Dead  and A Murder of Quality is present in very few scenes although his spectre  follows the action.  However, he is a Kafkaesque figure.  What is Smiley  doing?  Why is it important?  All is ultimately revealed or is it?  In  subsequent Smiley novels, the reader gets to see Smiley the player.  In The  Spy Who Came in From the Cold we get to see Smiley from the viewpoint of  one of the pieces.<br />The Spy Who Came in From the Cold works on one level  as a straight spy story, perhaps the best ever written and there is more  depth.  The \\"cold\\" referred to is not only a metaphor for the discomfort  one feels when one is isolated from home and security it is also a metaphor  for the Cold War.  Leamus is involved in a nasty, dirty business from which  he cannot easily withdraw.  Essentially he representsthe west, not wanting  to engage in the business, not sure why it is involved and who benefits but  unable to withdraw.   <br />Ultimately, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold  answers all the questions but in doing so creates far more unanswered  questions.  It is a thought-provoking masterpiece and one of the great  novels of the 20th century.

0812550706|3.0|To my surprise, the last 40 pages of Ender's Game largely redeem the novel, and raise my rating from 2 stars to 3 (3.5, if I could), especially for young readers.  I've read enough sci-fi novels that have great ideas  but weak endings not to give a great ending credit when it's due. For more  mature readers (I'm 31), the rest of the novel doesn't offer very much more  than a few cleverly integrated concepts of the psychology of leadership,  with little growth in the protagonist.  Like a comic book superhero, Ender  never missteps, and the obstacles he faces are all quickly dispatched with  a minimum of fuss and exposition. One can see why the novel appeals so much  to young readers. Minor point of logic: one wonders how victory could have  been complete given the bugger's apparently extensive off-world  colonization.
0380730405|2.0|I wanted to take the second Mrs. de Winter, give her a good shake and tell her to get a grip!  It's no wonder du Maurier never gave her a name. Anyone with any gumption would have fired Mrs. Danvers after the second encounter,  redecorated the west wing, given all those clothes to the local thrift  shop, and had a life. Obviously well-written, classic story of suspense,  etc, etc, but I had to force myself to finish this book - the heroine is so  useless I had no empathy with her at all.  And Maxim is another neurotic.  No wonder the book is called Rebecca.
B00004S6GL|2.0|Elliot has become a progressively better producer over the last decade but &quot;Figure 8&quot; proves that it has been at the expense of his songwriting skills.  There is not one, Not One, track on here that ranks  with his classics or even the average song from &quot;XO&quot;.  This is a  dreary, bitter album that disgusts me as a former admirer of E. Smith; too  many tracks seem to be jealous, snide attacks on other musicians who have  sold out.  I fail to see what other people see in this record.  It just  proves to me that today's college radio has become a glut of Good Old Boys  who rule by the strength of past successes, current failures be damned!
0449002632|2.0|London is the type of book that I generally love. However, I find many missing elements in the book, namely - women. Where the author is very meticulous with most details, he seems to skip important events where the  central players are women. Henry II made an excellent marrige... never  mentioned to whom! Only one of the most famous women who ever lived in  England. This is aparant all over the novel and I was sorely disappointed.

And the rumors about the  DVD NOT having a sub version better be false or else Disney have shot  themselves in the foot. This release deserves to be liked in dub, and  enjoyed in full - in sub!<br />Where are the other great titles from Studio  Ghibili on DVD? My wallet is itching... ;)
B00000DMJF|5.0|The sprawling double-album *The Beatles* (or the \\"White Album\\") served not only as a document of the group's disintegration but as a blueprint of the four's future solo careers.  The album itself is really composed of songs  written and sung by the individual members with the others serving as  backup.  No longer did one find examples of the group chemistry or ensemble  performance present in the earlier works that established them as THE '60s  band.  Here you can see the distinct personalities and styles of  the  individual members showcased for better or for worse.<br />*The Beatles*  contained spare, bare-bones production that served to highlight the songs.   The individual members outgrew some of the limitations that the group  format had formerly imposed on them.  Thus, Lennon was able to display his  angst more freely while Paul McCartney was given more free reign with his  pop tendencies.  Harrison explored his mystical and spiritual side while  Ringo Starr was given opportunity for a couple throwaway numbers.<br />The  variety of styles present here is staggering as the listener is reminded  how versatile and encompassing the Beatles' musical reach was.  \\"While My  Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is arguably Harrison's best song to date with its  melancholy melody and lyrics (not to mention guest guitarist Eric Clapton's  solo).  McCartney shows his melodic gifts in simple pop-folk numbers such  as \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" and \\"I Will.\\"  As if to show that he  can still rock, he adds the visceral and chaotic \\"Helter Skelter\\" that  finds Paul shredding his vocal cords and the whole band creating  instrumental mayhem.  The consistently finest moments on the album belonged  to Lennon.  \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" is a surreal number that is actually  three songs stitched together.  \\"I'm So Tired\\" portrays exhaustion as  Lennon's voice moves from intimacy to frustration.  \\"Yer Blues\\" takes on a  degree of autobiographical truth with Lennon's lyrics of suicide anddepression and one of his most authoritarian and commanding vocal  performances on a Beatles record.<br />There was some confusion surrounding  *The Beatles* at the time, especially when it was sandwiched between *Sgt.  Pepper's* and *Abbey Road*.  It was clearly the least Beatlesish record in  terms of spirit.  Yet, it is deeper than the other two.  While the  songwriting in *Pepper's* leaves something to be desired, and the tone of  the album at times seems maudlin and banal, and the second half of *Abbey  Road* (while dazzling the first few listenings) comes up ultimately empty,  *The Beatles* contains more deeper and honest moments than the other two  combined.  I believe it is the best album released by them.
B0000025F7|5.0|When this album hit the street back in September of 1979, the reaction was immediate, Michael Jackson was truly a force to be reckoned with. Quincy Jones' brilliant production, great musicial support, excellent songs, and  most importantly, some of the best vocals Michael has ever sung on record  is what makes &quot;Off The Wall&quot; great. In fact Michael hasn't sung  with such confidence and unbridled joy since then. And this album has aged  better than &quot;Thriller&quot;, though &quot;Don't Stop Til You Get  Enough&quot; and &quot;Rock With You&quot; are still heard regularly on the  radio, these hits weren't run into the ground, thus retain status as both  marks of their time, but timeless. Most importantly this album reminds me  of this brilliantly gifted artist before he became a one man media circus.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Well, This is one of my Best Cds of Manson.. I think he's ok.  That doesn;t mean that im Antichrist like him. no way, i love God.

B00004STPT|5.0|I was particularly struck by the terrific duality of this music after watching the film, so I purchased this soundtrack by Mr. Zimmer and Ms. Gerrard. Being familiar with both composers' works, I believe that they  accomplished a perfect embodiment of the range human emotion over the  period of one's life.<br />Who could not be drawn back into their deepest and  strongest hours when listening to the Battle? This was a powerful piece  drawing from pain, and devotion, and is reminiscent of other epic pieces  from old, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, and more recently, Horner's &quot;Legends of  the Fall&quot;, and of course &quot;Titanic&quot;. However, Zimmer's work  differs, in that his pieces sound more tempestuous, a virtual crescendo of  powerful imagery.<br />While Gerrard's themes bring the listener falling back  into remembrance, with golden impressions of &quot;The Wheat&quot; and the  ethereal sounds of &quot;Elysium&quot;.  Her music balances Zimmer's strong  presence by offering a subtle change in atmosphere. Quite similar to a  marriage, this music works in perfect candor, that eventually leads us  sparkling into another world, where we are free of this life; a dual effort  of both Gerrard and Zimmer, &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;.<br />This music has  a quality I have rarely found anywhere else, and has inspired me. I applaud  the efforts of these fine composers, and their incredible talents.
B00004T9UF|5.0|What can I say?  This guy has more talent than I might have guessed from listening to the first album.  Some of the songs haunt me.   Kim and Stan particularly.  Anyways this guys third album is going to be real good Id  think.  this album was better than the first.
6301008960|3.0|I think Can't Buy Me Love is just one of the cutest movies.  I think the move should be re-released.  I have been looking to buy a copy, and can't find one anywhere.  Please re-release this wonderfully cute movie!
B0000025VU|3.0|A good album that could have be one of the greats that EVERYONE owns along with &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;.  The songs are lyrically solid, but they also speak of his disillusionment which  I think shows in thier production.  Many are just painful to listen to  &quot;Neighborhood Bully&quot; while some are beautifully done  &quot;Sweetheart like you&quot;<br />Disillusionment (as mentined before)  seems to be a major theme here, with songs such as &quot;Neighborhood  Bully&quot; (attacking the state of Isreal), &quot;Man of Peace&quot;  (attacking Christianity), &quot;Union Sundown&quot; (Corporate greed wins  again as usual), and the aptly titled &quot;Licence to kill&quot; (Ritchie  Havens used to cover this one a lot, and did a great job).<br />Again I must  stress, every lyric on this album is SOLID, but I must confess I think they  would have been better served with just Bob and his guitar, or something to  make then easier to listen to.  <br />There are two definite high points, the  two that keep me listening.  &quot;Jokerman&quot; and &quot;I and I&quot;  both five star tracks in my book.  These two, interestingly enough, are the  songs that make best use of his band du-jour (Sly and Robbie, and Mark  Knopfler); these two also demonstrate how with a little more effort, this  could have been one of Dylan's best.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Dracula has been the subject of numerous films. While many of them are  memorable, of many actors who have played Dracula only two stand out as  truly superb in their performance of the role. The first one is  unmistakably Bela Lugosi who played the role in this 1931 film. While  Lugosi's film portrayal has the drawback of being terribly out of date, now  that more than 60 years have passed since, his magnetic appeal can still be  sensed thru this release. (For those who are interested, the second truly  superb actor is of course Christopher Lee, who unfortunately had to play  ol' Drac to death in way too many Hammer movies. And Gary Oldman was good  too but maybe a little over the top in Francis Ford Coppola's version.) TOD  BROWNING's DRACULA was a hit in the early thirties. We can still see why.  The film is said to have been restored but very little of this shows, as  there are still plenty of signs of wear on the print used for this DVD.  However, all the extra's more than make up for that. It is wonderful to be  able to compare Bela to his Spanish speaking competitor, Carlos Villarias.  Equally interesting is the comparison between Browning's direction and the  direction of the Spanish flick, helmed by George Melford. Melford's version  has the technical superiority, which cannot be denied, but Lugosi himself  is more enthralling in his performance. (I feel a little uncomfortable with  the Spanish version as I simply cannot help chuckle at hearing the changed  names of Juan Harker and Eva instead of Jonathan Harker and Mina.) Again,  the additional information due to special commentaries by David Skal, film  historian, Carla Laemmle and Lupita Tovar, and the wonderful photographical  montage added make this DVD extremely enjoyable and this not just for  classic movie buffs. A note for Philip Glass fans: while Glass's new music  score is very interesting to hear, the Kronos Quartet is unfortunately not  adequate to the task of bringing the full range of Glass'sthematics to  life. That is very unfortunate for it makes the new score sound cheap,  while it would have been great if it had been performed by a full  orchestra.
B000001EL3|4.0|As KISS bids farewell in the year 2000, its album from 1976 stands out as the definitive KISS collection. &quot;Destroyer&quot; is the album which gave KISS credibility with music critics, who previously bashed the band  for seemingly concentrating on its image rather than its musical skills.  The overall sound of &quot;Destroyer&quot; is significantly heavier than  any of its previous efforts, and the album, while not focusing entirely on  one subject, has a conceptual feel to it. The album kicks off with  &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, and this version on &quot;Destroyer&quot;  closes with the sound of a harrowing car crash as lead vocalist Paul  Stanley sings, &quot;...I know I'm gonna die...why?&quot; Stanley also  sings lead on &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot;, the catchiest and most  memorable track on &quot;Destroyer&quot;. The album also contains  &quot;Beth&quot;, the band's first top ten hit and a radical departure from  anything the band had done before.Performed by drummer Peter Criss,  &quot;Beth&quot; is a beautiful ballad accompanied by little more than  piano and violins, as Criss laments &quot;I hope you'll be alright/'cause  me and the boys'll be playin' all night&quot;. The only track that doesn't  quite click is &quot;God Of Thunder&quot;, due to bassist Gene Simmons'  over-the-top vocal style. The rest of &quot;Destroyer&quot; is rock solid,  and the must have album for anyone who wants to experience the very best of  KISS.
B000005S0D|4.0|Camel has been one of my favorite band. There are a couple of really great songs in this album and I like them very much but I think Moonmadness, Snowgoose, Raindances and breathless are their musical peaks. But the  beauty of 'long goodbyes' is one of the best among Camel songs as well as  the title song. Really lovely album but I miss Peter always.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I travel alot and was unable to see this movie in the theater...So I had an entry is my palm pilot to rent the DVD when it was released...Finally it came, and although I had expectations of it being a corny, but funny, I was  quickly surprised. The perfomances by the cast, the story line, and the  directing were all more than I expected. I laughed, and laughed the first  time I watched it...So I watched it a second time...Ditto... After  returning the movie, I just had to add it to my collection so I went and  bought it....After watching it another 2 more times and laughing again and  again each time, I'm convinced that this is a movie for all to love and  enjoy... Don't hesitate.
B00004TDTO|4.0|This version has a much clearer picture, better sound, and a spectacular image.  If you have ever heard of Steven Speilberg, you must purchase one of his finest!
B00004U30D|5.0|This movie is more than a dark comedy.  With its new age music, and true-to-life characters, it's an ode to the new century.  A century of mid-life crises, teen angst, and luxury cars.  <br />  Kevin Spacey does a  fabulous job of being the father of a teenager and husband of an  overstressed realtor.  When he develops a crush on his daughter's (Thora  Birch) friend Angela (Mena Suvari), the movie twists into an odd mix of  romanticism and 70s nostalgia.<br />  Annette Bening's portrayal of Mrs.  Burnham is a too-true vision of job stress and marriage trouble in the 90s  (or 00s).  In all, a wonderful movie with &quot;classic&quot; written all  over it.
B000006OAM|5.0|A beautiful, beautiful album.  <br />At first listen this seems like another &quot;Tigerlily&quot;, which was pleasant but forgettable, because the songs are also slow and serious.  But don't be fooled.  Natalie Merchant  continues to grow as a songwriter and performer, and this album is her best  work in every way.  <br />On the records she made with 10,000 Maniacs, there  were always a few songs which were stunning in their emotional intensity  and beauty (&quot;Cotton Alley&quot;, &quot;Gun Shy&quot;, &quot;Verdi  Cries&quot;, &quot;Dust Bowl Days&quot;, &quot;The Big Parade&quot;,  &quot;Jezebel&quot;, &quot;How You've Grown&quot;, &quot;Noah's  Dove&quot;).  On &quot;Ophelia&quot;, almost all the songs are this  revelatory, and their collective range of feeling is most impressive,  despite some reviewers' complaints about the absence of any uptempo  hard-rocking songs.<br />The arrangements are colorful and complexly layered,  and some of the songs are quite experimental and require a few listens to  &quot;get&quot; (especially the title track), but they all work.  The fifth  star in the rating is essential, because &quot;Ophelia&quot; is not only a  wonderful CD, it is so unlike any other one that those who don't have it  will have a serious gap in their musical experience. <br />All the tracks are  strong and interesting, but I would like to single out &quot;My Skin&quot;  and &quot;The Living&quot;.  Merchant's uniquely lovely voice is almost  unbelievably moving here; her  very subtle inflections, powerful and  intricate lyrics, emotionally precise delivery, and simple but remarkably  beautiful piano playing put these tracks at an artistic level frequented  only by Bob Dylan at his best.
B00004TH6O|5.0|I read reviews of the new Queens album on stonerrock.com, and most of them centered on the &quot;It doesn't sound like Kyuss&quot; theme. &quot;It's not Kyuss&quot;...&quot;it doesn't sound at all like Kyuss&quot; blah blah  blah. Quit your whining, all of you. No, it doesn't sound like Kyuss,  that's why the name on the record says &quot;Queens of the Stone Age.&quot;  And no, it wasn't what I expected; it's better. Rated R really covers all  the bases, and most of the outfield (if you can follow my baseball  analogy). It is not a direct follow up to the first record. If you're  expecting &quot;Queens of the Stone Age, Act 1: Scene 2&quot;, buy it  anyways (I did). If you want Kyuss, buy Kyuss. Otherwise, be prepared for a  brilliant record.

0385040253|5.0|This book has to represent the best value on the market today for anyone interested in knots, splices and fancy ropework. I worked in the Merchant Navy and have spent most of my life living on and around yachts, and I  sincerely wish that I'd discovered this book 35 years ago. The Ashley Book  of Knots is a treasure trove of useful information and instruction for  anyone, from novice to expert, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Jim  Briggs.  Gold Coast, Australia.
055350259X|5.0|As an Australian I greatly looked forward to Bill Bryson's latest book - and I was not disappointed. Although by his own admission he cannot cover anywhere near the whole continent of Australia he does his best to give the  reader a mouth watering overview of all the mainland states &amp;  territories.<br />Whether it is about train rides through Western Australia or  boat trips to the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, Bryson's style  describes them is such a way they make you seem to be there. Mixed in with  this is a miniture history lesson about many of the places he visits. He  seemed to known more about Australia (I am ashamed to say) than myself as  an Australian!<br />While reading this book I found myself in tears of  laughter (and at one point unable to breath I was laughing so hard) at some  of the stories he managers to tell. This is what I have always found so  good about Brysons style - he can turn a simple observation into something  you can laugh about for weeks.<br />In the end the book does trail of quite  quickly though, so I can only hope that means he will be back some time in  the future to provide more of his wonderfull insights.
B00004STPT|3.0|Umm..........well.........what can I say about it.  It's ok, if that.  You might find some things that might please you, but not much.  It's not very clever.  He could have made it so much more interesting.  The action parts  of it, is practically noise.  The brass is a little TOOOOOOOO powerful.  I  mean, yeah, most action things use a lot of brass.  But tone it down a  little bit.  I mean, I loud brass, in your face stuff.  But this is just  noise.  I would've rather Jerry Goldsmith do this picture.  After The  Mummy, which was pretty well done, and The 13th Warrior which is a great  score, I think he'd be the best person for the job.  But oh well, I can't  make the decision for who does what.  It's ok score, but only buy it if you  find a couple bucks laying around that you don't need.  Don't waste your  money.  If you don't have The Mummy, or The 13th Warrior, or Sleep Hollow.   You'll get great music out of that.

0790729970|4.0|I must say that after watching such films as ,She's The One, and others starring Cameron Diaz I was not entirely impressed with her portfolio but when I got this DVD and gave it a quick viewing I must say I was(cough,  cough) wholeheartily impressed with her performance. Okay, aside from  watching this movie in that Music Television sort of way that totally  discounts any of the other action going on other than the beautiful women  being creatively(yet tastefully, yeah right) photographed I actually found  this flick to be very appealing. I really don't know whether to call ,The  Mask, a musical comedy, a romantic comedy, or a fantasy but I'm sure it's a  bit of each. This is certainly a movie that showed Jim Carrey to be a good  addition to the cast. His cartoonish comedy fit the role of a man with a  love of cartoons very well, or should I say,&quot;Like a glove.&quot;(I'll  apologize in advance for the quote from Ace Ventura Pet Detective)The  singing scenes were great. I have to admit I laughed a lot particularily  during the scene with the cops instead of arresting Stanley Ipkus(How the  hell do you spell that name?)they sang and danced to the &quot;Cuban  Pete&quot; song. The other singing scene in the Coco Bongo with Carrey and  Diaz dancing was not to shabby either. Ipkus's buddy Charlie was funny in a  corny kind of way. His line about always wanting to say I believe it was  take them away boys or something to that effect added to the cheese  factor(Hey, I like cheese) The actors who played the officer and the  sidekick in pursuit of the man in the green mask(AKA Ipkus) were very funny  and the joke about the impossible pajamas was witty to say the least. The  cameo by Ben Stein of Win Ben Stein's Money and Ferris Bueller's Day Off  was also well placed. You know, the villain had a very Eric Roberts like  aura about him.(Naturally, I didn't like him) So ,The Mask, is for anyone  who deep down inside is a love crazed fiend with or without a really bad  set of pajamas.(And of course a green mask of the night god Loki) The Mask  is certainly worth a look, maybe even two.(hundred?)

B00004T37H|5.0|What are some of the reasons that this film is great?   Well, for  instance, I have never cared for anime before, but this film totally turned  my opinion around.  &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is the gorgeous,  powerful, heartfelt tale of a young woman loyal to her family of wolves;  the forest- destroying humans of an iron producing town, and the  courageous, dying prince caught up in the middle.  The animation is  breathtaking; carrying the story is also a very professional translation of  text and superb voice-overs.  Plus, the musical score and theme song only  add to the film's beauty.  This film is not only entertaining, but it  carries a powerful message about respect for the environment, respect for  other people's needs, and respect for all things.  Remarkable  story-telling, beautiful, swift and smooth animation make this film an  animated drama/adventure/action masterpiece.  An incredible treat for the  heart and soul.
B00000JZIK|5.0|It's been five years since the release of The Usual Suspects, so you should have gathered by now that there's a bit of a twist at the end. (Don't worry - nothing shall be given away.)<br />The first time you see this  film, it's the twist that will blow you away, leaving you gasping for air  on your sofa, unable to stop grinning at the sheer brilliance of the final  loop-the-loop in the rollercoaster ride that is the incredible script.  You'll notice the acting and the dialogue, of course, but it's the ending  that will stick in your mind.<br />Wathc it again, however, and it's a whole  new experience: just take a look at the little titbits that were missed the  last time round but can be enjoyed even more now that you know how it turns  out. The twist will still hit you, but it's not as strong.<br />The third  time, however, is the real turning point. This viewing will ensure that the  dialogue is imprinted on your mind, and the fantastic performances won't be  forgotten in the fog of amazement that the ending pumped out the first  couple of times. When it comes, the denouement won't be such a thrill any  more, but on the plus side, you'll enjoy the two hours or so that precede  it even more.<br />If you haven't watched it yet, buy it quick and prepare to  be blown away, and if you have watched it, watch it again.<br />And again ...
0140283587|5.0|There is not much more that needs to be said about &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; that has not been said already.  It is a really good book. Not only is this one good, but so are Sutcliffe's other two novels.   Yet in America, we cannot get these books here on Amazon.com since they are  only available in the UK. We would have to pay the high shipping costs or  go there ourselves.  Anyway, the two other novels that exist are called,  &quot;New Boy&quot; and &quot;The Love Hexagon.&quot; Sutcliffe is  hilarious!
B00004TEWP|5.0|This album really packs a punch! There are really some great dance/upbeat songs,&quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;;&quot;Don't Go Knocking On My Door&quot;;&quot;Satifaction&quot;. The ballads are okay &quot;Don't Let Me  Be The Last To Know&quot; and others. What's really great that this album  has a theme which is I think is having a stronger of yourself through many  courses of situations. Doing the cover of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is  awesome because it brings a whole new dimension of this classic song. This  album is also great because Britney puts creative input by co-writting  &quot;Dear Diary&quot; which reflects on how she's grown as an artist and  as a person. Finally, the extra tracks such as &quot;Girl In the  Mirror&quot; and 2 more are really great and fun to listen to. I recommend  this album to every Britney fan because it shows a different to Britney and  her music. <br />                  Happy Listening! :-)
B00004RFFM|1.0|High concept: Combine Towering Inferno, any stalker movie, and Jaws.  Throw in a hack director (&quot;Cutthroat Island&quot;), what could go wrong?<br />Plenty.  Not scairy, not funny, not campy.  I will never get those  90 or so minutes back.<br />As their oceanic research building starts to sink  to the bottom of the sea (don't ask), and the &quot;smart sharks&quot;  start to stalk the inhabitants in the hallways and rooms, well, what else  was there to do but watch in dumbfounded amazement as the animated shark  (looked like a reject of a Saturday morning cartoon) gobbled them up  one-by-one in a single bite, complete with teardrop shaped squirts of  animated blood.<br />The best scene: the cook being roasted in his own oven,  who happens to have his fire ax with him to hack his way out.  Gratuitous  scene, the bombshell head researcher wiggling out of her wet suit to stand  on so as not to get electrocuted (don't ask).  Worst scene: take your  pick.<br />This movie is so bad I actually felt sorry for the cast - whatever  they were payed, it was not enough.  And if the shark was so smart, how did  he get roped into this movie?  I hope he ate his agent...<br />I still have  not forgiven Brittish Air for forcing this on me.

B00001P4RI|5.0|Having been a huge fan of all work done by the members of Dead Can Dance, I must say, it's wonderful to hear from Brendan again.  He's been a little quiet for a while.  I missed him.  The album is excellent.  I'm listening  to it for the first time when &quot;I Must Have Been Blind&quot; comes on.   And I find myself knowing the words.  And I'm thinking, how could I know  this when I'm just hearing this song for the first time?  And then I  realized that he was covering This Mortal Coil.  If anyone is worthy to  cover This Mortal Coil, it would be Brendan, a 4AD favorite.  I especially  enjoy &quot;Medusa&quot; and &quot;Death Will Be My Bride&quot;.  I have  always had a deep respect for Brendan, who in my opinion is one of the most  talented musicians of our time.  A brilliant mind, an old soul - wise for  his age.  Dark.  Wonderful.  Every Dead Can Dance album has a different  mood.  I think this is the mood Brendan was in when he created these  pieces.  I trust that with each additional album he puts out, we will feel  him change and grow.  Brendan, as well as Lisa (Gerrard) both have a way of  expressing themselves in their music.  True artists.  If this is your first  experience with Brendan, get this album, you'll love it.  But also be sure  and check out the work done by Dead Can Dance and Lisa Gerrard.  I trust  you will soon become a huge fan, and join the rather large underground  following.
6305078564|4.0|&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is one of the top 10 novels ever written.  The BBC miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is the finest adaptation to date. The actors are superb. The screen play is accurate,  comprehensive, parsimonious, and entertaining. The dialogue is beautiful  and preserves much of Jane Austin's witty and wry commentary. The  cinematography is superb. The film was shot in authentic locations all over  Britain.<br />I thought the film adaptation by the BBC and A&amp;E was so  fine, I bought the VCR tapes when they were released, then I bought the  lazer disk version, and then I bought the DVD version. The DVD version is a  big fat disappointment. The quality of the DVD transfer is NOT good.<br />First, the colors appear faded and with the Regency English palette of  beige-greens, browns, ambers, and taupes, this is a serious defect. It  makes the clothing look worn, the grass and trees look sunburned, and some  places, the complexions look downright washed out. The film appears to have  been shot in Arizona at high noon instead of England.<br />Second, for some  bizarre reason, the DVD processors nipped and tucked some of the original  material. The clipped portions might not bother one who has never seen the  original--but I noticed. There was no need to edit this film. Four of the  50-minute sections are crammed on disk 1 (where the editing takes place)  and the other two were recorded on disk 2. I guess it would have made too  much sense to record three episodes on each disk?  Seems like poor planning  to me.<br />For the price of this 2-disk DVD package, more care should have  been taken with the transfer process. My lazer disk version cost less,  holds more, and has beautiful resolution.
B00001ODHJ|4.0|In this not-quite-sequel to Evil Dead II, our hero Ash has been sent back in time.  Never mind that at the end of ED2 he's being hailed as a god from the sky and at the beginning of AoD he's in chains as a slave.  These  continuity errors are part of the fun.  And fun there is to be had in large  doses.  It's all there - the cheesy dialogue, the cheesy special effects,  the cheesy plot.... you get the idea.  And it's great fun.<br />But it's not  quite as great fun as ED2.  Campbell is a little more reserved in his  haminess (is that a word?), and the climactic battle with the titular Army  of Darkness drags on too long (as if Rami fell in love with his special  effects budget).  But, all in all, it's recommended.<br />As for the extras -  with both letterbox and pan-and-scan on the same disc, there's not a lot of  room.  However, especially welcome was the alternate ending (he made the  right choice in keeping the ending he did).  The special effects  documentary was also interesting, but, like it's incarnation in the movie  itself, running on a bit too long.  All in all, however, a good set of  extras.
B00000K3UR|5.0|Big Daddy was better than I thought it would be.  When I first heard it was coming out I said to myself &quot;It can't top Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison&quot; but it did it was THE BEST ADAM SANDLER MOVIE YET.
6305807086|4.0|This film rates 4 stars on the strength of the film itself (possibly even approaching 4.5 stars).  I'm told that if you have the surround sound super duper theatre at home, it's a better experience, but I only have a DVD  player and a TV, and haven't yet upgraded my sound system.<br />This is a very  entertaining movie.  A tad heavy-handed at times (perhaps oppressive is a  better word, as in the atmosphere).  The lighter moments were the best, and  were suitably spaced throughout the movie.  The immortality part of the  plot seemed too contrived for a movie that is otherwise so original.  But  this is a small price to pay.<br />As for the DVD edition, there are some  great bits.  I especially appreciated the full versions of the puppet  documentary and the orientation film that were shown as part of the movie.   Less interesting was the puppeteer and interviews outside the theatre and  the extra in the car for the drive-by scenes.  They are not interesting,  and seemed tacked on.  I was also dissappointed there was no director's  commentary.  Surely of all the movies I have seen in the last few years,  this one deserves that treatment!
B00003Q43A|5.0|I own this movie and I think it is one of the better movies I have seen in a long time. All movies are for intertaining,after all its just a movie.
B000000OQF|5.0|This CD is a classic. Its got great songs including my personal favorate &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot;, it has everything from love to hate. From the time the album starts and u first hear Axl belt out &quot;Welcome to  the jungle....&quot; ur hooked. I highly reccommend it for any heavy metal  fans. I think the really outstanding songs on the album are welcome to the  jungle, out ta get me, paradise city, my michelle, sweet child o' mine, and  rocket queen. This CD Rox!
6305807086|4.0|A lot of people thought it was a stupid pointlees film, I believe that these people did not understand the film and did not realy get into the movie as much as I did I thought it was funny, weird and made you think  also a lot of good acting and a lot of stars two thumbs up.
B00000099Y|5.0|nima is one of the most origional albums that i have ever purchased. It is the first of TOOL's music that I have heard, and it sure set a positive future for my TOOL listening. After listening to this album I went out and  bought Undertow, also by TOOL. And which later lead me to buying A Perfect  Circle. Which features the lead singer from TOOL, Maynard. Like i said..  This cd never gets old like some one-hit-wonders. Everytime I listen to  this CD, my love for the band grows larger and larger. If you are a fan of  good music, i definitly suggest you chcking this band out... you will not  regret it, and you will be giving a small amount of money for hours upon  hours of absoultly magnificent, inspiring, beatiful, rich, MUSIC!
B00003CX59|5.0|This is a very good movie I love how Tim Burton portays his views of the movie in his weird twisted way.  I also was amzaed at Francis Ford Coppalas flashbacks very scary.  The acting was great and Chris as the headless  hourse man was great I give it two thumbs, up way up.
B00004STW3|2.0|O.k. it is supposed to make fun of 'Independence day' but wasn't 'I.d.' enough? The cast can't save it and neither can the special effects. Two stars for the production, which could have been better allocated to a  different movie.
B00001U0GQ|1.0|Bizarre shaking and lagging of image components ruins shot after shot.<br />A sampling of affected scenes:<br />*Hawkeye visits cabin.  Dinner table briefly leaps upward in the frame, while the rest of the room remains  stationary.<br />*Cora Munro reaches down to grab weapon from dead soldier's  hand.  Soldier's forearm vibrates in and out of its sleeve before she  touches it, resembling clever Halloween prank.<br />*Dialog scenes in the fort  have mouths that move while the rest of the face remains impossibly  immobile, an effect previously seen only in claymation films.<br />*In the  jail, a backlit window moves vertically in shot, closely followed by the  wall in which it is mounted.  Truly astonishing effect.<br />I wanted to cry.  I paid $26.00 for this beloved movie, and the DVD only hints at the film's  glory.  I cannot in good conscience even screen this film for friends and  family without embarrassment and apology.  Yes, the cinematography is  breathtakingly beautiful, but I lost count of these bizarre artifacts, so  tremendously numerous and so distracting.  They absolutely ruined what  would otherwise have been a stunning film.  I was actually convinced my DVD  player had broken till I swapped in another title and confirmed the problem  was the media, not the player.  I could not feel more ripped  off.<br />Dvdreview.com describes it this way (how I wish I'd seen this before  I'd bought my copy): &quot;...director Michael Mann ... adds about 15 new  scenes ... the transfer immediately caught my attention however.  In a  number of scenes, it seems as if heavy restoration was required to achieve  the image quality we ultimately see on the screen.  As a result certain  parts of the image appear to be `swimming' and `ghosting' where the  computer has tried to restore missing picture information and where heavy  noise reduction had been applied.  I am not sure why a film from 1992 would  require such dramatic restoration that would result in such noticeableartifacts, but the effect was very visible in a good number of  scenes.&quot;
B00004IA0K|5.0|The chili Peppers and their Box set rock, need I say more?
B000000H48|5.0|To me, there are three essential King Diamond records: Abigail, Them, and Conspiracy.  These three records comprise some of the best metal recorded in the late 80s.  It's hard to put King Diamond, the band, in a category.   This is metal for sure, but may not appeal to die-hard thrash/death/speed  metal fans who shy away from melody and harmonies.  That's not to say that  this goes as far as Helloween or other such melodic-metal bands, but it's  more towards that ballpark.<br />King Diamond, and these three records, work  so well because of a perfect combination of great songwriting; inspired and  extremely skillful playing; tight, well-rehearsed arrangements; and the  chemistry and personality of the players.  Mikkey Dee is one of the great  unsung metal drummers.  Andy LaRoque's hooks and flourishes are always a  joy.  Earlier and later King Diamond records suffer from the lack of at  least one of these qualities, or from the lack of some of the personnel.   Mikkey Dee, especially, is sorely missed in the post-Conspiracy era.  The  songwriting on the later records is lacking the great hooks of the  Abigail/Them/Conspiracy triumverate (but, after 1990, songwriting for most  metal bands changed in a way I did not like).  Also, King's story  conceptions on these three records have always seemed to me to be more  inspired.<br />The bottom line is that there are plenty of people who are  never going to like Kind Diamond.  Either they're simply not into this kind  of metal, or they can never get used to King's singing style.  For my  money, though, these three records are important, inspired, and a  must-have.
0375420525|1.0|It's a shame the house on Ash Lane wasn't in New York, as it could have been leased for millions.<br />Seriously, this is some of the most awful tripe I've ever had the misfortune of reading.  The multi-level narrative, when  done well, is a literary device meant to keep a reader's interest; however,  in this case it only prolongs the banality of the novel.  I mean, how many  times are you going to be fooled with Truant's hallucinations?  After  reading &quot;But none of this ever happened&quot; for the nth time, all I  could think of was what if it never happened that I plunked down 20 bones  for this trash.<br />And then the footnotes!  Just one headache after another  contributing little or nothing to the story.<br />Lord preserve us from  erudite pseudo-authors.
0553573403|5.0|This book is incredible.  It is a breath of fresh air that is not the formulaic cookie cutter fantasy that appears so often.  Martin creates exceptional characters that are also mortal and DON'T miraculously come  back life.  The writing is excellent.  I recommend this book to anyone who  enjoys good literature, However if you are looking for a book where  everything ends up shiny and happy then do not read this book.  Martin does  a marvelous job of creating shades of gray for the classical fantasy  characteristics of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot; characters.  This  is an Origonal fantasy not a good guy goes on quest, good guy fights bad  guy for fate of the universe, and good guy wins and everyone lives happily  ever after.  There are actually consequences for actions here.  This is not  to say i don't enjoy the other kind of fantasy, Martin's is just very  refreshing.

B00000J7RZ|1.0|'Music' career? Did i just say that? Most of the stuff on here would not even go under the category 'Music' it is so bad. 'Could this be love', 'Talk about us' and 'Open off my love' prove my point finely. Cheesy  ballads, that couldn't even make it as a Mariah Carey b-side. And then  'Should've never'! Oh my god! People who gave this album 5 out of 5, did  you actually listen to the heavy breathing at the end of this? Worse than  Mandy Moore's on 'I wanna be with you'. The only reason i bought this is  for 'If you had my love', the only songs i ended up liking were that, 'No  me ames' (purely for Marc 'WOW!' Antony),'Waiting for tonight' and 'Baila'  (on British versh). The rest compensated for those  bearable moments. I  much prefer to listen to Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Selena  and Britney's new album. However this almost made me throw my cd player out  of the window. Basically, Jennifer Lopez + singing career + dodgy  latin-wannabe music = nasty mess. And for all of you out there who think  people like me  are jealous, CLEAR YOUR EARS OUT!
6302732875|4.0|James Foley's film of &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; is not only one of the best films ever made of a play, it's definitely the best film David Mamet has ever been involved with.  Mamet is The Man Who Mistook Himself  For A Director; his own films as a director tend to make me giggle, with  their stylised deadpan and bizarre rhythms, but the brisker and more  unbuttoned Foley succeeds in making Mamet's frequently overlapping dialogue  flow and glisten.  The play is notoriously tight and indoors, and Foley (or  more likely, the producers) makes a token attempt to suggest the world  outside (including a subplot, not in the play, about Lemmon's sick  daughter, who if he gets sacked may die in hospital - the only bit of the  script that doesn't ring true).  It doesn't really matter.  The real meat  is the crackling malehood of the whole thing.  The other bit not in the  play is Alec Baldwin's towering cameo as the Man from Downtown (&quot;You  need brass balls to be in real estate&quot;), in which he not only blows  such superb actors as Lemmon, Ed Harris and Alan Arkin off the screen, but  thoroughly redeems himself for having made such not very good films  everywhere else.  (Apart from his fine work in &quot;Miami  Blues&quot;.)<br />Not a couple movie, this.  One for getting together with  your mates, some beers, some pizza and a memory retentive enough for you  all to be able to chant your favourite lines back at the screen.  All  together now: &quot;Will you go to lunch?  _Will_ you go to lunch?&quot;
630575067X|5.0|I've seen a lot of negative reviews for this one. I don't know why either. Was Jar-Jar annoying? Yes, in some cases he was very annoying. Anyone else remember how annoying C3PO used to be? That didn't stop the first trilogy  from becoming classic. The action (especially the end lightsaber fight) is  spectacular. The special effects are also spectacular and blend very well  with the rest of the story. Over all, I think people just expected way to  much out of this movie and were dissappointed when it was merely just as  good as the other Star Wars movies.  I for one was very excited when I  first saw this movie. I was like a kid the night before Christmas when I  first saw Star Wars Episode 1 scrolling up the big screen. I was not  dissapointed.
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends marks the beginning of Radiohead's ascent to greatness. And what a rapid, astonishing rise it has been- 3 albums in, and already, they've found themselves carrying the future of music on their slender, human  shoulders. <br />This is the album BEFORE the phenom that was and is OK  Computer. The Bends picks up the threads and lost musical ideas that ever  so slightly marred Pablo Honey, and transformed them into powerful,  beautiful rock music that fans will devour until the day they die. <br />It's  that good. <br />Takes you a few listens to get into, for sure. But when  you're in- when the drone of 'My Iron Lung' is in your mind; when 'Fake  Plastic Tree's' is embedded in your head... you have finally found the  music that you've yearned for. It doesn't get any better than this- and  that's not a fanatic fan's point of view. It's a fair observation.  <br />Opening with 'Planet Telex', we are treated to treated keyboards and  stomping drums- and no matter how much you want to- you can force it, but  it 'will not come...' <br />The title track is a masterfully written rock  song- straightforward indeed, in this album, but who wouldn't scream:  &quot;We don't have any real frieeeeennnnds?&quot; <br />The tracks here are  interesting. Not just melodic. Not just catchy. Interesting. And that's a  testament to Radiohead- they strive for something deeper, and here, they  hit upon it every time- every track. <br />And by the time you  moan:<br />&quot;Immerse your soul in love&quot; - your world has already  changed for the better. Spread the word, people. This is a great record.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's novel &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; throughly deserves its huge critical acclaim. Telling many stories in its content, it deals with the growing up and learning process of Scout, (Jean Louise) a little  girl who lives with her father Atticus and brother jem in the deep south of  America. In between the years of five and eight, Scout comes across Dill,  whose sad unloved story touches even the hardest reader, an ill-tempered,  prejudiced old woman, whom Scout's father describes as &quot;the bravest  woman he ever met&quot;, and most importantly, the &quot;nigger&quot; Tom,  whose obvious innocence of the crime of rape is ignored, to be punished by  death. These hard-hitting storylines would give the book a somber tone, but  Lee cleverly moves away from this by giving the narration to a child,  making the book witty, light-hearted, yet serious, dealing with issues  still very much alive today.

0767802470|5.0|And much better than the cinema version. Though it's pretty long at 209 minutes, this movie is so powerful it won't seem long at all. The casting and the cinematogrophy are amazing.

0800132335|5.0|Set aboard a German submarine in the early years of World War II, &quot;Das Boot&quot; is a great film and is certainly one of the best war movies ever made. &quot;Das Boot&quot; overturns many of the myths of  submarine warfare perpetuated by some historical accounts and by cheesy  Hollywood films. Life on the U-boat is considerably more cramped than one  would imagine, and even officers must get up from the dining table to make  room for passing crew members. The discipline on the U-boat is also relaxed  in many ways. Officers and crew shed their uniforms and grow unkempt hair  and beards. For the vast majority of the U-boat's time at sea, the crew are  bored, restless, and desperate for action. During most of the combat  scenes, the stealthful U-boat is actually quite vulnerable. And far from  being the ruthless undersea killers that legend has them to be, the U-boat  crew are quite human<br />Until I saw this film, I always believed that like  the German army on land, the U-boat wolf packs were unstoppable at sea.  After watching this film, however, it became clear that despite the havoc  they wreaked in the North Atlantic, the U-boats were never a match for the  British navy. Even before the invention of sonar and radar installed  airplanes, the U-boats lived in terror of British warships.<br />After seeing  this film for a second time I read several U-boat books to verify the  accuracy of what I had viewed on screen. Even some of the most improbable  events like the U-boat crew getting decimated in an air raid after  returning to port were corroborated in the history books.<br />I commend this  film for its realism, its drama, and its utter lack of sentimentality. Many  scenes in this film are as vivid and realistic as the opening scene of  &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. Unlike parts of that film, however,  nothing in &quot;Das Boot&quot; is didactic or manipulative.
B00000INEX|1.0|Baby Bach was a severe disappointment.  Unlike their Baby Mozart video, which is lively and really holds our daughter's interest, this video is slow paced and not of much interest to our daughter.

6305177473|4.0|When I first heard that Disney had remade &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; I was, frankly, unenthused!  I mean, how could they top Haley Mills, Maureen O'Hara, and Brian Keith...well, they didn't top it, they EQUALLED it.   Essentially the same story but '90's style.  The whole cast is excellent,  including the secondary characters as well as the main ones...I loved the  mini subplot with the butler and maid getting together!  And having the  original Vicky Robinson play the fiancee's mother was brilliant!  My  eight-year-old niece can happily watch either the Haley Mills version or  this one and be equally content...partly due to both these films, she is  enthusiastic about her first week at sleep-over camp coming up this summer!   Like the 1960's version, this is a movie that the WHOLE family can truly  enjoy...oh and I almost forgot to mention how incredibly CUTE Dennis Quaid  is in this movie!

The efects are amaizing and the frasing of the lines beautifuly  constructed, with an economy that is in itself compeling. It's a magical  film.

0679420401|5.0|I can't remember the last time I was moved so profoundly by a work of fiction.  I finished the book two weeks ago and have not been able to stop talking or thinking about it.  Read this book.  It will truly change the  way you view the world.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written.  Steinbeck's  style flows so smoothly and is so accessible.  The book follows the Joad  family for about nine months as they are driven from the place they've  called home for generations and travel to California, only to find out that  it is not the land of opportunity they expected.  Steinbeck's formula here  is to intersperse the lengthy chapters chronicling the Joads' journey with  short chapters that encapsulate some nuance about the period or the people,  giving you a picture of the greater struggle taking place, of which the  Joads are just a small part.  It creates a very powerful effect.  This  migration west involved hundreds of thousands of individuals.  You see in a  few pages the big picture, then you are pulled back into the intimacies of  the Joads' lives and the tragedy is made very personal.  In one especially  startling example, Steinbeck puts these words into the mouth of a character  after selling a nameless migrant and his family some gas for their car,  \\"Well, you and me got sense.  Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no  feeling.  They ain't human.  A human being wouldn't live like they do.  A  human being couldn't stand it to be so dirty and miserable.  They ain't a  hell of a lot better than gorillas.\\"  In the next chapter, the Joads make  camp along a stream and Ma is so happy for the clean water and the chance  to stay put for a day so that she can take a bath and wash the family's  clothes.  The Joads are good, honest, decent people looking for the means  to earn an honest wage and thereby feed their family.  The thought of  charity repels them.  At one point Pa talks about the prospect of picking  cotton and is so excited about the fact that it's good, hard work, worthy  of the wage he'll earn.  How soft and incredibly privileged it makes us all  seem.  \\"They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless - restless as  ants, scurrying to find work to do - to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to  cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food.\\"<br /><br />I live in a citrus  community in Florida, which is populated by a large number of migrant  workers.  It never occurred to me to wonder how they felt about their  lives.  I never thought to wonder if they had dreams of someday owning  their own home and staying put for a while.  I've read criticism that \\"The  Grapes of Wrath\\" is a communist manifesto.  It may have socialist leanings,  but how long can individuals or a society overlook the less fortunate  without feeling some shame? Read this book.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|Absolutely a must buy for all you Maiden fans out there....Brave New World is absolutely out of the world and it's awesome to hear Maiden back to the old sound...they are just awesome, track after track, and I just cannot  wait for their US tour!..UP THE IRONS!
B00000IJPU|3.0|THE BAND: Over the years - Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Blaze Bayley (vocals - 2 songs only), Steve Harris (bass), Dave Murray (guitars), Adrian Smith (guitars), Janick Gers (guitars), Nicko McBrain (drums), Clive Burr (drums - 3 songs only).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1996) 16 tracks clocking in at approximately 78 minutes. Included with the disc is an 18-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, numerous band photos (old and new), names of albums / singles released, and thank you's. The compilation follows the band through 1995 (even though original singer Paul Di'Anno is featured on the back cover and in the liner notes, he does not sing on this album... Dickinson sings the lone Di'Anno penned song \\"Running Free\\" live). There are several versions of this \\"Best Of The Beast\\" available - a single disc with bonus tracks, as well as a Japanese import containing a 2nd disc. Remastered sound. Label - EMI / Raw.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: The Number Of The Beast (3 songs), Piece Of Mind (1), Powerslave (2), Live After Death (1), Somewhere In Time (1), 7th Son Of A 7th Son (3), No Prayer For The Dying (1), Fear Of The Dark (1), A Real Live One (1), X Factor (1), Unreleased (1 - \\"Virus\\").<br /><br />COMMENTS: I've been a fan of Iron Maiden since their debut (own all their studio albums on vinyl and disc, as well as most of their live material). The cash-spending listener has some choices to make, as there are numerous Iron Maiden compilations out there (7 or 8 at this point?). For the novice looking at a single disc compilation... this \\"Best Of The Beast\\" will serve as a lukewarm intro to the band. Plain and simple - there are way too many great Maiden tunes... and one disc simply isn't enough for such a long and storied career. Long time fans will notice many glaring song omissions on any single disc mix - including this one. Looking for a more in-depth purchase - check out the 2-disc set \\"Essential Iron Maiden\\" (2005) containing 27 total tracks, and features older Di'Anno songs (yes, with Di'Anno singing) from their 1980 debut and \\"Killers\\"(1981), as well as newer songs from \\"Brave New World\\" (2000) and \\"Dance Of Death\\" (2003). \\"Best Of The Beast\\" is not without merits though. THE GOOD: This was the band's 2nd compilation ever (and since Maiden's 1st \\"The First 10 Years\\" is so cumbersome and rare) I jumped at this one. Many of the standards are here - \\"Run To The Hills\\", \\"Number Of The Beast\\", \\"Aces High\\", \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\", \\"Wasted Years\\", \\"The Trooper\\", \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", \\"Can I Play With Madness\\", \\"Fear Of The Dark\\", etc. Derek Riggs' artwork is intriguing - on the album cover as well as the disc - showing many versions of Eddie through the years. The booklet is extensive - tons of photos (though small) and all song lyrics are a plus. Remastered sound is crisp. THE NOT SO GOOD: Several things. Too many missing songs - \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", \\"Flight Of Icarus\\", \\"The Prisoner\\", \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\", \\"Revelations\\", \\"Powerslave\\", \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\" (even if it is over 13 minutes long), \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\", \\"Moonchild\\", \\"Infinite Dreams\\", their cool remake of Jethro Tull's \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\", or anything from the band's debut or \\"Killers\\" albums featuring Paul Di'Anno. The unreleased Blaze song (\\"Virus\\") is an utter bore and a waste of 6 minutes of disc space. Three songs from \\"\\"7th Son\\" is excessive, as only one song from \\"Piece Of Mind\\" is criminal. And lastly, two songs from Blaze Bayley, yet no songs from Paul Di'Anno... is just wrong. OVERALL: Some great songs here, but simply not enough. Start with the 2-disc \\"Essential\\" or better yet, go with any of their classic albums from 1981-86. In my opinion, \\"Best Of The Beast\\" is for the Iron Maiden completist only (3 stars).s (yes, with Di'Anno singing) from their 1980 debut and \\"Killers\\"(1981), as well as newer songs from \\"Brave New World\\" (2000) and \\"Dance Of Death\\" (2003). \\"Best Of The Beast\\" is not without merits though.

Too many missing songs - \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", \\"Flight Of Icarus\\", \\"The Prisoner\\", \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\", \\"Revelations\\", \\"Powerslave\\", \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\" (even if it is over 13 minutes long), \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\", \\"Moonchild\\", \\"Infinite Dreams\\", their cool remake of Jethro Tull's \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\", or anything from the band's debut or \\"Killers\\" albums featuring Paul Di'Anno. The unreleased Blaze song (\\"Virus\\") is an utter bore and a waste of 6 minutes of disc space. Three songs from \\"\\"7th Son\\" is excessive, as only one song from \\"Piece Of Mind\\" is criminal. And lastly, two songs from Blaze Bayley, yet no songs from Paul Di'Anno... is just wrong. OVERALL: Some great songs here, but simply not enough. Start with the 2-disc \\"Essential\\" or better yet, go with any of their classic albums from 1981-86. In my opinion, \\"Best Of The Beast\\" is for the Iron Maiden completist only (3 stars).
B0000027I6|5.0|If you are going to buy one Roger Waters CD, let this be the one. Waters' most ambitious, focused, fully-realized solo CD is also one of the best albums of the '90s, but it is not for the faint of heart. Waters' views on modern life, war and commerce are well-known, but his vitriol and contempt were never more concisely articulated than here. This work rivals &quot;The Wall&quot; as Waters' best-ever work, and, unlike &quot;Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking&quot; or &quot;Radio KAOS,&quot; this album even has something missing on Waters' other solo albums: melody. Wit, lyrical black humor and some dazzling free-form guitar work courtesy of Jeff Beck--this is, quite simply, a must-have.
0395645662|5.0|The Giver is a great book. I have read it twice because the first time I read it I was little and i didnt understand it. The second time i read it i enjoyed it much more, i would reccomend this book to juinor high students. It gives you an idea of what tyhe worl would be like without color and with  many other differences.
B000002AH7|5.0|I don't think anyone has ever made an album like this one, the blend of traditional Spanish music w/ classical &amp; jazz tones, all blended superbly into pure musical escapism. It wasn't enough for Miles to just  create the immortal Kind Of Blue that year, he had to do something else  equally excellent but completely different as well. The opener &amp;  highlight Concierto de Aranjuez goes for 16 minutes but couldn't be  considered too long except for those w/ short attention spans or the lack  of brains &amp; heart to 'get' it. There is a bit 8 &amp; 1/2 minutes into  it which that other great musical pioneer Don Van Vliet [Captain Beefheart]  liked so much he incorporated it into Sugar &amp; Spikes, 1 of the 28  tracks from his masterpiece Trout Mask Replica. That alone would make this  album worth hearing but there is something truly magnificent &amp;  otherworldly about Sketches. Incidentally another version of the track  [composed by legendary violinist Niccolo Paganini who everyone believed was  possessed by the devil because of the ferocity he played w/] appears on the  Modern Jazz Quartet's In Memoriam album. Saeta, track 4, is the other  highlight, much emotion pouring out of the trumpet, in a still quite  restrained manner. This is accessible music but can be very much  appreciated by those who like it arty too.
B00003W8NM|4.0|I ask a film to entertain me or to make me think.  I rented this movie based on someone telling me it was action packed.  I expected a Brad Pitt &quot;entertainment vehicle&quot;.  Boy, was I wrong.<br />This is a dark tale  of revolt against our culture.  Frankly, I found influences of socialism as  the fighters final target lowers debt to the masses.  Obviously, there are  mental health issues in this movie.<br />This is not a &quot;date&quot; movie  and my wife quickly left the room.  While it started slow and I was  struggling, eventually I was engrossed in this tale that challenges your  comfort zone.<br />I do not necessarily like the new genre of young movie  makers' fascination with violence.  This is the first movie I have seen  that used violence as a flashpoint to deliver the movie's message and I  found it brutal but acceptable.  I would love to sit down and talk to the  screenwriter and director just to pick their mind as to how this movie  ended up as it did.<br />A fascinating psycological thriller.  I recommend  this for thought, not for &quot;light&quot; entertainment.
B000001GJX|4.0|Like most of the digital recordings Karajan made, this one is also excessively polished and emotionally detached. However, it is an overall great performance(more perfection than the somewhat overrated live  Bernstein recording around the same time), and soprano Barbara Hendricks  gives a really beautiful performance. She is perfect...The other soloists  are good too. The dynamics are large, some of the quiet moments are hard to  hear, and the organ, if present, is not heard. In general, Karajan's  recordings made during the 60's are usually among the very best ever, and  most of his 70's recordings are really wonderful too. So instead of buying  his DDD recordings, consider the ADD ones, when he was widely acclaimed as  the best conductor in the world, and his conducting had none of the  mannerisms and blandness of his later career during the 1980's. Besides,  the Berlin Philharmonic was a much better orchestra during the 1960's and  70's, and those recordings usually have even more outstanding soloists,  like Gundula Janowitz in the earlier Mass in C recording.
6305807086|2.0|Not horrible, Truly original, But BORING... I was very excited to see this film and wanted to like it, But it was so BORING. I usually like John Cusack and Cameron Diaz, And like them I did.  BORING. Did I mention the  film was BORING. Definatly not the best of 1999. Maybe I was expecting to  much. Different it was Entertaing sometimes, But always BORING
B00000K2SC|4.0|As a visual effects extravaganza, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of the  best films ever made.  The Wachowski brothers, together with a host of  now-Oscar-winning technicians, have created a bleak yet stunning view of  the world as run by computers, with effects that will have you hitting  rewind just so you can marvel anew at what can be done with technology  these days (the fight scenes in particular are mind-boggling).  As for the  story, well, it's nothing that hasn't been done before--ordinary guy  recruited into shadowy underground to save freedom.  The basic  premise--that life as we know it is essentially a giant computer  game--seems to be a soapbox for the filmmakers to have the characters go on  at length about society's dependence on machines and the old &quot;what is  reality&quot; spiel.  Lawrence Fishburne, who plays the hacker turned  father figure Morpheus, and Hugo Weaving, as the sinister &quot;agent&quot;  seeking out the last free humans, don't seem to be acting so much as  lecturing--in fact, everyone in the movie speaks very slowly and  deliberately, enough so that it gets to be funny after a while.  Keanu  Reeves is his usual expressionless self, but this is definitely a breakout  film for Carrie-Anne Moss, who doesn't show much in the way of acting  talent but does possess a splendidly toned form which is frequently  displayed in skintight black vinyl (and performs some amazing moves to  boot).  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a fun movie to watch, no question, but  it's not the great manifesto some diehards claim it to be.  Get out the  popcorn, plop down on the couch, and prepare for some great entertainment!
B00004T37H|5.0|After viewing this film in theaters, I must say it was probably thr best  film I have ever seen in an actual movie theater.  The artwork, story and  animation are all absolute top-notch.  A wonderful story about a young lad  strikken by a demon outcast from his villiage in search of a cure for his  'ailment.' What he finds is a town under attack from vicious wolves. Well,  the wolves are only trying to protect their territory. Even better, these  wolves are not just wolves, but actually gods if you will. They have raised  a young human girl.. who believes herself to be a wolf herself, despising  humans. Where the story goes from here, I'll let you decide, or find a  synopsis elsewhere. It's not my place to ruin the film for you. The  translation was scripted by Sandman's Neil Gaiman, and well done at that.  The only gripe I have with this film is a few of the voices.. Billy Bob  Thorton just wasn't a convincing monk... I also feel they probably could  have found a better voice for the Princess herself. But oh well, still an  excellent, must-see film. Not for children.. a very strong and deserving  PG-13.
B00000016V|5.0|Jim Morrison and the Doors cease to amaze the music population.  Even after Jim was getting bored with music, he and the other members strived on for this last album that they would make.  The lyrics and rythm for this  album are still very fresh.  The fans could not be more appreciative for  what &quot;America's Beatles&quot; have done for us.
0316777722|5.0|Like another reviewer, I regret having read it so fast. It's another fabulously funny book by one of our world's truly original voices. He's just so funny and odd and wonderful. The chapters about France were  especially interesting. He's very playful with language and culture. I look  forward to reading it again, and taking my time to savor.
B00004THAY|4.0|This BB King/Eric Clapton partnership created a great album- Riding With the King.  It has a great modern blues sound.  It is not possible to expect anything but good from these two masters.  I hope they will record more  albums like this in the near future.
0312243022|3.0|This book is beautifully written and is a very good homage or imitation of Virginia Woolf's language and style. I found the portions about her life to be the most complex and interesting; the prologue was especially moving.  However, I couldn't help but notice that Cunningham wasn't as good at  writing like Virginia Woolf as Virginia Woolf was. It made me want to just  reach for &quot;The Waves&quot; or &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; instead.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I hadn't heard of this film before I saw it (okay, I know I was in a minority of one but I'd been abroad!). When a friend suggested that we see a movie, I wanted to see Schwarzenegger in \\"End of Days\\", but my friends  wife had already bought tickets to see \\"Life is Beautiful\\" (LIB). When I  asked what it was about, I was told something like \\"It's an Italian Black  and White movie, with English subtitles, about a Jewish man in a  concentration camp\\". I can't begin to tell you how much I DIDN'T want to  see this film. Two hours later, I emerged from the cinema with a warm glow,  having been put through a gamut of emotions, thanking my lucky stars that  my friend had got to the kiosk ahead of me.<br />LIB is an odd film; how on  earth can you marry a subject that evokes such compassion and outrage as  the holocaust with what is essentially a comedic love story? But LIB comes  through in spades. The film is basically divided into two acts. The first  introduces the hero as an eccentric, jocular guy, out to enjoy the life God  has given him in every way, and the escapades that lead him to meet and  marry his future wife. The comedy here owes much to the visual, vaudeville  style and works superbly well, given that scripted jokes sometimes fail  horribly when translated into another language. The second act is  understandably very much darker, when our hero, son and ultimately wife are  arrested for no apparent reason other than being alive. Even here, however,  Roberto Benigni manages to introduce humour (notably the \\"Instructions\\"  scene, when he `translates' the Camps Rules and Regulations, as announced  by the Camp Guard in German, into Italian for the benefit of his son,  despite not speaking a word of German) albeit above a veneer of  desperation. It is reasonably hard to depict the depth of love a parent has  for their child (and spouse), but LIB comes as close as I've ever seen on  film.<br />Without giving TOO much away, Benigni chose wisely with his ending;  itwould have been all too easy to give us a traditionally happy ending.  For me, the conclusion was STILL a happy ending - the hero achieved what he  had set out to achieve, and is rightly called a Hero.<br />As far as the  subtitles are concerned, you really won't notice them after the first ten  minutes, and this comes from somebody who LOATHES subtitles.<br />Possibly,  the DVD version loses something from the sheer scale of the cinema release,  but then so does every other film.<br />This is a film that I would NEVER have  CHOSEN to watch - the film simply didn't sound like a fun way to spend two  hours; I wanted to watch Schwarzenegger rip a few bad guys apart. Having  spent two hours entranced by it, I'm sorry Arnie, but LIB just blows you  out of the water!
B000002C1V|5.0|A constantly underated album that needs to be heard without paying attention to the strife within the band at the time. It contains, quite simply, some of roger waters most heartfelt lyrics. Thoughout the album he  delivers them, fluctuating between brooding darkness and  agonising mental  torment. Some of the songs are truly outstanding, from the poetic sadness  of 'paranoid eyes' to the climactic realism of 'the final cut'. 'Two suns  in the sunset' is the true gem of the album and shows Waters genius, as he  whispers through the amalgamation of human anger and nuclear war. Not  classic pink floyd, but the height of their progression.
B00003Q43A|5.0|What a great movie it is.  Would be appreciate if the DVD is decoded with DTS effect as well.
0451151224|4.0|Sthephen King is not a science-fiction or fantasy writer. He is a horror writer. But - since he's an excellent one , he tried his hand at both - and succeeded more or less (his fantasy is better).<br />&quot;The Running  man&quot; is a sci-fi thriller in the near future. the story of Ben  Richards and a giant T.V corporation. Ben sighns a contract that allows the  &quot;The running man&quot; stalkers to hunt him down , for a period of 30  days.<br />If they win , he dies - for the viewing pleasure of the mind-numbed  masses. If he wins - they lose one million dollars. <br />Anyway , unlike in  the movie - that is excellent - Ben's not restricted to some  &quot;zones&quot; , he can go anywhere in the world only that he got to  keep moving , 'cause the stalkers are on his back - and the stalkers are'nt  flamboyant killers with fans , that go one-on-one - they are regular guys  (killers , I mean) dressed in &quot;The running man&quot; overall's ,  trecking him down in groups , and killing with simple guns.<br />Pretty nice  book , though I saw the film first , so it kinda ruined it for me (the film  is more exciting). <br />I like King's work - especially his  &quot;regular&quot; horror , but if you want to try something a bit  different by him try &quot;Eyes of the dragon&quot; or &quot;The  Talisman&quot;.
B000002UE1|3.0|I don't know about how &quot;honest&quot; Grand Funk was but, boy, in 1970, was it LOUD! In high school, it was perfect for pissing off the smartasses who'd play The Band or The Dead over and over again, and with  enough weed, only Black Sabbath, Zep and the Joe Walsh-era James Gang were  as capable of doing that much of a mindf**k on yer brain as GFR. But we all  get older and listening to Mark, Don and Mel in 2000 sounds, uh, quaint,  honestly. True, the wah-wah guitar going from one ear to the other in  &quot;I'm Your Captain&quot; still sounds kinda cool, but &quot;Mean  Mistreater,&quot; &quot;Hooked On Love,&quot; &quot;Nothing Is The  Same&quot; and everything else except maybe &quot;Sin's A Good Man's  Brother&quot; are all pretty lame tunes. Thing was, they were pretty lame  then, too, but we were all younger. I guess you could have a worse  nostalgia fix than listening to this album, but for HM nostalgia, I'm  probably more likely to put on Ozzy-era Sabbath. Better hooks.

6305508550|5.0|Exellent dialogues...Satire that is very accurate.  I watched this movie after a tough week at work.  Made me laugh at my job situation because this movie IS MY JOB...
6305499365|5.0|Let me first say that this is not meant to be a realistic movie.  This is the fantasy of everyone who has ever worked in a cubicle, endured smarmy bosses and the relentlessly stale wit of cow-workers.  For years, I would  have loved to take a bat to the office laser printer.  This film finally  let me see my frustrations taken out--of course I'm sensible enough to not  smash someone else's laser printer myself.  That's what this movie is--a  fantasy outlet for those of us who just get fed up with work sometimes.
B00000IAU3|5.0|All right, I admit it:  I'm 18 years old, and I watch the WB.  Though Buffy is my favorite show, Roswell has been growing on me, partly because it's a good show and partly because I couldn't get the damn theme song out  of my head.  You see, I generally listen to &quot;arty&quot; bands, one  that definitely aren't played on TRL and seem to get the most exposure on  M2, like Ben Folds Five, Elliot Smith, Travis, Portishead, Belle &amp;  Sebastian, Rufus Wainwright.  Let me tell you, Dido is as good or better as  all of the above.  After the Roswell season finale, I immediately bought  this CD, and haven't stopped playing it (driving my Backstreet  Boys-obsessed sister nutty in the process).  I'm not exactly sure how a  non-mainstream singer of this caliber managed to have the theme song to a  teen melodrama (albeit a very well done one), but I don't care, seeing as  the WB exposed me to my new favorite singer.  Dido is too good for the  average watcher of the WB, who will be frightened away by her lack of silly  adolescent posturing.  Hopefully, Dido will gain an audience of people who  appreciate her.  This is an astonishing CD, and one that should definitely  be on any thinking person's wish list.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Put this CD on, sit in a comfortable chair, close your eyes, and let the music take you back to Sinatra Live at the Sands. A wonderfully recorded and remastered selection that has become one of my all-time favorites. This  takes you back to a time before the Venetian Hotel &amp; Casino rolled over  what had been the playroom for Frank and the &quot;Pack&quot;. This is your  chance to go back in time, feel the vibrance of Count Basie and his  Orchestra, and enjoy a treat for the senses. I was too young to have  enjoyed this live, but thank goodness for the miracles of recording  technology!
6302973724|5.0|This is the best concert you'll see and hear, believe me... I've seen many DM concerts in video, but when I saw &quot;Devotional&quot; my mind simply exploted...I had the concert in CD already but the Anton's vision shows the  amazing performance like something sacred. You will suffer with Dave with  &quot;Condemnation&quot;, fly with &quot;Never let me down again&quot; and  suffer once again with &quot;In your room&quot;. If you're a DM fan, this  video will be a trasure in your collection...if you're not, then this is a  good reason to be.
B00003OSTN|4.0|The comments made by Stephen Jones below are pretty much on target.  This is an interesting mix of &quot;women's film&quot; and &quot;film noir.&quot;  No easy task since the genres are so opposite in many ways.  And no, it's not always a successful mix. But what makes it ultimately work  is the same kind of &quot;dissonance&quot; also found in Curtiz'  &quot;Casablanca,&quot;--the grim world of noir vs.the womanly concerns of  romance and family.<br />Joan Crawford is, well, Joan Crawford. Her steeliness  belies the purported warmth and lovingness of the title character.  There  are hints that her self-sacrifice is a kind of self-glorification (as her  husband pretty much states flat out during the argument they have just  before they separate).   The commentary by so many of the reviewers of this  film is incisive and goes some distance toward answering one of my key  questions about this film: Just how dated is it?  Perhaps like me you  groaned just a little bit during the interrogation scenes, perhaps you  cringed a tad when Joan Crawford (of all people) started mouthing  platitudes about motherhood and sacrifice.  But if you're at all like me,  you couldn't help but get caught up in this melodramtic mix.  It gets campy  in parts, but camp has to have a core of emotional truth if it's going to  succeed.<br />Mildred Pierce succeeds very well indeed.  It is indeed a  fascinating amalgam of two wildly divergent styles.  As with  &quot;Casablanca&quot; before it, director Michael Curtiz offers a bit of  romance, a lot of self-sacrifice, and just enough intrigue.  It does comes  off a little dated then, but it's hardly just a period curio. It remains  hugely entertaining.

B00003CX95|4.0|I was disappointed when I received the VHS version of the film for my birthday shortly after seeing at the film at the theatre.  The problem is that a large segment was eliminated (relating to the attempt on Wallace's life).  It alludes me as to why the 20-30+ minutes was removed from the  video, if I was able to sit mesmerized throughout the entire film, although  needing a break for personal reasons, it seems odd that the film would be  shorten for home video, where one has the conveince of pausing.  I want to  purchase the DVD, or VHS that is a directors cut that matches what I saw at  the theatre.  Even with the out take it is an excellent film, and I would  recommend it to anyone, but I must admit those who missed the chance of  seeing the entire film are missing out on a signifcant part of the  plot/storyline.  I feel sorry for those who either due  to physical or financial limitation where unable to see it as I did it was  and is my favorite film!
6305892946|5.0|I thought the end to the Scream Trilogy was superb. It wasn't as good as the original Scream, but good just the same. It took on a completely new outlook at the whole Scream saga, and included fresh ideas from a new  writer. This film was funny at the same time as it was scary. There are  rumours that this was not, in fact, the final Scream (as it should have  been), but it brought a good thing to an end with its ending. Scream 4, on  the other hand, would be stupid and not make much sense.
B000003FD9|5.0|Bach's suites for solo cello were dismissed by his first biographer as technical exercises!:  their profound beauty only gained notice when Pablo Casals first began playing them as integral suites, early in this century.   Casals' performances of these pieces, for all the shortcomings of the  recordings, are still some of the most remarkable musical statements I have  ever encountered.  Many superb cellists have recorded them since, but  Starker's may be at the top of my pile.  He possesses a dazzling technique  that lies totally at the service of the music.  Every time I listen to  these performances I find myself breathless in astonishment at the beauty  of the phrasing.  These are not &quot;original instrument&quot;  performances, but at the same time Starker maintains a kind of reserve that  seems completely appropriate to this noble music, and quite different from  other modern performances.  Altogether, there is something magisterial  about his ability to express true emotion without lapsing into  exaggeration.   All music lovers should know the Bach cello suites,  disarmingly simple in places and full of rhythmic and tonal complexity in  others.  This recording is a superb statement by an artist who is in total  control: technically of his instrument, and emotionally of the music  itself.

It shows the tough conditions the crew  had to face when making the film (This film was made during the Great  Drought of '88). Once you learn how and why this film was made then you'll  understand why this film has such a strong hold on us after all these  years.

0743200799|5.0|Just a kid when the Mercury astronauts were first lofted skyward, I was more fascinated by what was going on in Mission Control than I was by what the astronauts themselves were doing, which was mostly just sitting there  pushing buttons. I had no idea why dozens of men in the control room were  sitting in front of seemingly identical monitors -- did they actually have  real jobs, or was it all just for show? None of the television commentators  ever bothered to explain what was going on in there.<br />Which is why Lost  Moon, the book on which the movie &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was based, was such  a revelation. Only then did we really learn that the extraordinarily  complex spacecraft carrying the astronauts never functioned perfectly for  more than five minutes at a time, and controlling a mission was about  solving mind-numbing problems that were occurring thousands of miles away.  That the men on the ground were the true heart of spaceflight was confirmed  for me by the chapter in Failure Is Not an Option about the very first  Apollo mission, which was flown from start to finish by Mission Control:  there were no astronauts on board the vehicle.<br />Kranz, the buzz-cutted  ex-test pilot who was the very personification of Mission Control (Ed  Harris played him in &quot;Apollo 13&quot;), gives us an insider's view of  that critical function, complete with fascinating stories of some of the  more harrowing incidents that the public was only dimly aware of. Of equal  interest are his observations about what it was like to build from scratch  an organization for which little precedent existed.<br />At times repetitive  and self-congratulatory, Failure Is Not an Option is nevertheless a  compulsively readable, engineer's-eye perspective on what is arguably one  of the two or three greatest technological triumphs in history. Like Lost  Moon, it's only major fault is that it's entirely too short.
B00004THAY|5.0|BB King and Eric Clapton..what a combo!  This CD is awesome.  Both are at the top of their game and sound great.  Blues Guitar lovers dream.  If you love the blues like I do you will fall in love with this disc.
B00003CXDU|5.0|Galaxy Quest manages to be a tribute to and a good natured but very funny spoof of the original Star Trek television series, its cast and fans.  <br />The Premise is that for the past 17 years since their show was cancelled  the cast of a short lived science fiction series has been making a living  by making guest appearances at science fiction conventions.  <br />The cast  members including Tim Allen , Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman are  attending yet another convention when they are approached about a new gig  by a group of space aliens. The Aliens have intercepted the television  signals from the old show and mistook them for &quot;historical  documents&quot; and think the cast members are heros who can save them from  an evil foe.  The confusion and fun take off from there.  The Aliens (who  are an engaging lot) have constructed an exact working copy of the ship  from the series &quot;The Protector&quot; , duplicating even the parts they  didn't understand or need often with hilarious results. The evil adversary  awaits them and their varied efforts to do good and/or survive result in a  surprising good mix of adventure, comedy and some touching moments wrapped  up with a rousing ST type ending.  Worth every penny!
B00004THAY|4.0|First off, when I heard that BB and EC were recording an album together, I got very excited.  It's about time that the modern most influential blues artists get together.  They have the most distinguishable guitar tones in  music.  You instantly can figure out if Lucille or Eric is playing - and  their tones weave together perfectly.  The only downfall:  I would have  like to hear some more of Eric's stuff.  Imagine BB playing the solo on  Layla!  Ahh, a bluesfan's dream...
630575067X|1.0|Like so many others I waited fingernail biting for many years. Also like many old fans I was left sorely disappointed.  Now I kept my expectations relatively low for the new movie-and still it was bad! (Really bad) Most of  my friends desperately wanting to keep Lucas venerated had &quot;it was  alright/ had some cool effects&quot; to say, only to later join my much  stronger &quot;I hated it&quot; stance.  I've heard plenty of negative  criticism without some specifics, so here are some of the problems with  Lucas' blunder as I see them:<br />-THE TARGET AUDIENCE: (it was kids!)  Now I  know the desire was to keep Star Wars available to all ages, but this  failed. The original movies were mature enough in dialogue, mood, and  detail to enthrall older ages, yet still accessible to younger ages (Darth  is evil). This movie though, is kept accessible to its target audience  while neglecting the majority of its fans.<br />-THE COMEDY: (cheap laughs and  clowning) In keeping with making a children's movie, Lucas had to ensure  that all of the comedy could be understood, therefore physical buffoonery  was the only out. Would it have been too much to include some subtle banter  (or any verbal comedy) like that found in the other movies? (and capable of  entertaining audiences older than twelve). Really though, does anything  more need be said than Jar-Jar? I don't think so.<br />-THE VIOLENCE: (can't  have the kids see any) Now not that I advocate violence for its own sake,  but in this film its a mix of clowning-robot breaking-safety. The first  five minutes of A New Hope are more violent then this entire movie- Vader  parading over the fallen bodies of the storm troopers and rebels (and this  was '77, not the desensitized world of the millennium). Violence can be  used as a tool to produce mood, enforce the gravity of a situation, or (as  Lucas likes) a chance to have a clown dance around making light of a 'war'  (I guess because we wouldn't want our target audience tobecome upset at  all the violence)<br />  -SELF-CONTAINED WORLD: (it was not) The movie has  placible accents (that are also painful) and connections with the 'real  world'- i.e. the steriotypical comentators during the pod race.<br />-THE  CHARACTERS: (because I care) The characters and their interactions are  boring and cardboard. The enemy is not built up at all. Sure old Mal looked  pretty nifty, but what is he? The villain- he dies- oh well, whatever, nice  and one sided (after all, the target audience will get it). The same  emotional impact is felt when Qui-Gon dies: &quot;oh  well&quot;.<br />-UNBELIEVABILITY: (suspension of disbelief has                      limits) Anakin is in his fighter plane, avoids dying, and accidentally  shoots what turns out to be integral to the station and thereby winning the  battle being 'fought' on the planet. I'm sorry I just couldn't work with  it.<br />-ANAKIN&quot;S FOREIGN TOUNGUE: (why? why?) Petty, maybe. Integral to  the story, no. Annoying? Hell ya! Whose idea was it to have Anakin speak  his rhyming gibberish? Were they going for the 'hey this sounds made up'  sound, or the 'are they doing this on purpose?' sound?<br />I apologize for  not going into greater detail (because believe me, I could) but these are  some of the more prominent problems to a movie that I would plan to watch  again only to find all those faults that have been forgotten since seeing  during its first week.<br />My conclusion: Lucas has become drunk with success  and lost his mind.
B00000J7J4|1.0|Once I heard Santana's new song with Rob Thomas (Smooth) I was very excited to see that Santana was back on the charts with a great song.  I raced to the nearest CD store and bought &quot;Supernatural&quot; After I  listened to &quot;Smooth&quot; I went through the rest of the CD and it was  definately not the Santana of old, the guitar master of classic albums like  &quot;Abraxis.&quot;  It was like listening to a combination of Tito  Puente, Bob Marley, and Lauren Hill.  Absolutely terrible stuff for any  rock fans.  My advice:  buy the single.
B00004T37H|5.0|Once in a while a gem of anime comes along and this is just one of them. The story is compelling and it's a refreshing change from the apocalyptic themes that most animes have, it involves normal people without super human  strength. The animation is superb, layering effects that move the scenery  are neatly done. A must see for everyone who loves anime and animation in  general, you might even learn a lesson or two.
B00004TH83|1.0|I'm a fan of Lara Fabian's from her Carpe Diem days.  Noting with interest her guest slot on Richard Marx' Flesh and Bone album and reading about her entry into the U.S. market in Billboard, I prepared myself for the arrival  of another major new talent.  But this album, her U.S. debut after  considerable success in Europe and Canada, does her no justice.  Not a  vocalist who specializes in fireworks to begin with, Fabian used to line  her songs with nuance and subtlety, sly turns of phrase, and elegance.   Here it's all reduced to studio gloss, in no small part due to producer  Walter Afanasieff, a has-been who's long lost his ability to arrange,  unable to tear away from the most basic synth and piano arrangement, with  stiff beats and hollow melodies.  The obvious prototype for this album is  Mariah Carey's 1990 debut, but whereas Carey's debut used the  understatedness of producers like Rhett Lawrence and Ric Wake to complement  Carey's powerful, unrestrained vocal pyrotechnics, when applied to Fabian's  already understated voice, subtlety becomes blandness.  Quite simply, there  isn't any kind of dynamic to be found on this record.  Every song here is  bland, lyrically inept, and flatly sung, Fabian seemingly bored with the  whole proceeding, auto-dialing her performances.  And the music is like  elevator serenades, or department-store ambience:  Soulless, joyless, void  of emotion, and generic.<br />Fabian would do well to study British singer  Beverley Craven's second album, Love Scenes.  Like Fabian, Craven has a  controlled voice with few peaks and valleys, but she and producer Paul  Samwell-Smith had the ear for eccentric arrangements and sophisticated  piano work to back up her conventional love songs.  In Fabian's case, the  motley crew of studio pros she's stuck with as collaborators have been bled  of their joy in music over the years, leaving nothing but the technique and  the gloss, ruining Fabian's chance to express herself on her U.S.  debut.<br />I'm greatly tempted to take up on Sony Music's offer to give a  full refund in case of dissatisfaction.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie was really incredible.  It completely captured the GenX disillusionment with our pop-bubblegum culture (to paraphrase from the movie a little).  The dialogue is witty and intelligent.   Having watched  the movie a few times now, I enjoyed picking out elements throughout the  beginning half of the movie that supported Jack's revelation later.  Then I  looked at all the special features included with the DVD.  This DVD set  easily makes the most and best use of the DVD format.  They definitely  provide enough great stuff to warrant a 2 disc set.  If you enjoyed the  movie at all, I recommend getting the DVD, if just for all the great  special features.
B00004THAY|5.0|Great CD!  Cant recommend it more!  If youre any type of fan, whether new or old, you will enjoy this cd!  Clapton and King at their very best!  Go out and buy it now!
0767903854|5.0|Being both an owner of every Bill Bryson book in print, and a patriotic Australian, I couldn't believe my luck when I found this book had come out.  I currently live in the USA, so it was interesting to see an Americans  point of view on Australia.  Bryson's insightful views on the country avoid  stereotypical characterisation of the people and places, and he mixes his  accurate and always relevant research perfectly.  I learned things about  Australia that I didn't even know, and being one of those much discussed  Australians who first see the world before even regarding travel in their  own country I realise how much of my own country I have ignored.  In my  opinion, this is better than 'Walk in the woods', which I found drifting  and aimless in sections.  'In a sunburned country' nearly heads in the same  direction, but saves itself with constant changes in scenery and the method  with which he covered the country.  Maybe I am biased because of the  subject matter, but it is a great read.  If you are going there, get the  book and read it on the plane.  You'll get a much better understanding of  what the country has to offer than by reading a guidebook to Sydney.  And,  Bill, if you are reading, thanks for not mentioning Fosters, Paul Hogan or  'Shrimps on the Barbie' even once.
B00004RFFU|5.0|what to say, this movie presents itself with magic and talent. both tom cruise and brad pitt make an excellent profomence. the dingy atmostphere in the beginning gives you the sence that you are a vampire. and when they  show you a glimps of the sun you close your eyes and shutter as they do. if  you like fantsy and vampires then i would highly recommend this movie.  although it leaves out certain part that rice wrote in he stunning novel,  you still get this feeling of awe. it's mystical and magical everything you  could ever want from a movie. i know your thinking 'another vampire movie'  but it realy isn't neil jordan does an excellent job in presenting the  story. you almost feel like your there in the story itself. you can tell i  really enjoyed this movie that's why i think you should buy it now, before  it vanishes into the dark for all eternity.
B00004THAY|5.0|Eric Clapton has done it again, his many recent collaborations with artists has proven to be extremely fruitful for his career.  The artists he has worked with, ranging from Babyface, Sheryl Crow, Santana...have all  shown how adaptable EC is to current times, and this album furthur shows  how he is still God, even in a supporting, sometimes lead role.  His  exploration of the blues in the 90's led him to &quot;From The  Cradle&quot;, the best blues album of the decade, and now he teams with a  fellow maestro, B.B. King, and the result is amazing.  If you are a fan of  either B.B. King or EC, this is a must have.

0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time.  Jane Austen writes with impeccable wit and creates characters who are likeable, laughable, and very real.  Pride and Prejudice is an absolute delight, Jane  Austen at her best.  Read it.  If you are anything like me, you will be in  heaven.
044022165X|5.0|having saw the movie 1st..i related the book to it..with the characters and all..in a good way this book and movie were very similar..i could tell this having watched the movie shortly after reading the book..a sad at  times, but overall uplifting good read..i look forward to the rest of  grishams books..ive also read the firm
B00003CWL5|5.0|American Beauty is something so breathtaking, so extrodinary, that I had to think to myself for a few moments after a viewing. I thought about about all the plot -- the Ricky character and his homophobic dad; Lester and his  relationship with his wife, not to mention his daughter; the conclusion on  a dark and stormy night; and why this was the Best Picture from the Oscars.  I can easily say that I know now why it won so many awards. I would watch  all these award shows giving out heaps and heaps of awards to American  Beauty when I had never seen it before. I just saw it about an hour ago.  Whew. What extrodinary work. The acting is nothing less of excellent, the  musical score is compelling and the camera work was indeed the best I saw  in a looong time. I would recommend you buy this or at least rent it;  either way, it's your time to get into some good movie action.
B00000JGEO|5.0|There are two ingredients for a great Arnold flick:  tonue in cheek comeday and unbelievable action.  This movie has enough of both of these for two movies.<br />When Arnold gets together with James Cameron, you know  the action's going to be unbelievable.  I can't wait for TRUE LIES 2.  The  chase scene in the snow, the bridge chase, and the Harrier scene...some of  the best action I've seen in years.<br />Jamie Lee Curtis as Arnold's  unsuspecting wife is just great.  She can play both the vulnerable  housewife and the hard as nails woman protecting herself...plus she can  scream really well!  The chemistry between her and Arnold onscreen is  great.<br />The comedy in this movie is great.  Tom Arnold plays Arnold's  partner and just gets walked all over by him.  Has to take all the abuse  and cruddy jobs...just hilarious.  Then there's Bill Paxton's bit role as a  sleazy car salesman.  He does an unbelievably funny job.<br />This is probably  Arnold's best movie since TERMINATOR 2.  Definitely a must see for any  action junkie.
B000002LND|4.0|When I first bought this album, I thought immediatly there should have more songs on this CD. Of course, the classics are there.It should also have included songs like, &quot;Everybody&quot;, &quot;Who's that  Girl&quot;, &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot;, &quot;Where's the Party&quot;,  &amp; &quot;Burning Up&quot;. For a Madonna fans it is a must have.
630027179X|3.0|Excalibur was a good movie but flawed. Some of the acting was very average as well as the screenplay itself. Never the less, John Boorman did a spectacular jod directing. Several scenes for very powerful.Including the  final battle with Mordred. I also thought that the scoring was effective.  This film may seem visualy dated now, but it does not matter. If you are a  big fan of the Arthurian legend, this is a must see.
B000002NJS|4.0|Initially when I purchsed this CD, I was somewhat disappointed. I expected more uptempo songs. As I continued to listen to it, it became apparent that it is a wonderfully crafted album. Madonna has once again evolved her music  and does not stagnate in her style. As the times continue to change, so  does personal taste in music. Madonna knows people, including herself,  cannot listen to &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; type songs forever, though we  look back at them with admiration. <br />Once again, her ballads continue to  stand out. &quot;Power  of Goodbye&quot;, &quot;To Have &amp; Not To  Hold&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot;(the strings in this is almost  dramatically theatrical), are very moving. Madonna's RAY OF LIGHT is a  truly remarkable album . Some who hate Madonna's music, have an  appreciation for her new music. <br />Madonna continues to feel the pulse of  music lovers. She proves that versatilty is a must in order to survive in  this industry. <br />It's a pleasure knowing we have artists like Madonna  still around. With so many new people out there, coming and going, the new  artists don't have a chance in surviving this brutal industry. New artists  are not given the opportunity to explore their talents, which is why there  will probably not be another Madonna, Janet Jackson, Whitney or Mariah  Carey anytime soon.<br />RAY OF LIGHT is welcomed change and I look forward to  the future releases of this extremely &amp; most diverse artist.
6304935811|4.0|Patton is undoubtedly one of the greatest biography films ever made. The screenplay is  flawless, and George C. Scott gives one of the most impressive performances I have ever seen. Karl Malden also did a terrific  job as Omar Bradley. I cannot say that this is a war movie at all. It is  really a movie about a warrior. Never is the reality of war depicted, it is  given to you through Patton's eyes. I would highly recommend everyone to  see it.
0316236535|5.0|This book is the ultimate &quot;empowering tool&quot; for giving little ones control over their fears. It first builds a monster, adding a feature or two on each page through the use of cut-out pages. First the two big  yellow eyes appear, then the long bluish-greenish nose. By the time you add  the big, scary green face, you've got one scary monster.<br />But don't worry,  because once Big Green Monster is all put together, he's taken apart again.  &quot;YOU DON'T SCARE ME!&quot; reads the text, &quot;So, GO AWAY...&quot;  Page by page and one by one, the scary features disappear as ordered. The  book ends with &quot;GO AWAY, Big Green Monster! And DON'T COME BACK! Until  I say so.&quot;<br />Wow. If only I'd had this book when that scary clown was  in my son's closet. Or when the mysterious cowboy was in his brother's  room. Or when that nasty giant was hiding out in my parents' fireplace  about thirty years ago.
B00004THAY|5.0|Riding With the King is the best blues album I have had the pleasure to hear in a long time. Clapton and King are obviously having a great time together, and that feeling shines through on the album. With the superb  vocals by both of these legendary artists and the fantastic guitar runs  filling the entire disc, any listener will be in blues heaven. If you love  the blues, buy this CD now. You won't be disappointed.
0920668372|5.0|This is another one of those books I can't read without having to dab at my eyes. Any loving parent, or child of a loving parent, will recognize the overwhelming love the mother in this story feels for her son. When her son  is a newborn, she rocks him and sings to him, &quot;I'll love you forever,  I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living my baby you'll be.&quot;  When he's asleep, she rocks him and sings him that song through each stage  of his childhood. When he's a grown man with his own home, she drives over  to his house with a ladder, makes sure he is fast asleep, climbs through  his bedroom window, then rocks him and sings to him (my husband thinks this  is a little strange, but I'm convinced that there are plenty of mothers out  there who would do the same if they thought they could get away with it).  <br />        The tears come when the mother gets sick, and can't finish the  song. Her son then holds her in his lap, rocks her, and sings to her. Then  he goes home, picks up his newborn daughter, and sings.           The  illustrations are a beautiful complement to the story. Not only does the  son grow up, but the mother slowly grows older. Her house keeps its  old-fashioned look, even down to the rotary phone on her bedside; his house  is more modern, with up-to-date kitchen appliances. The mother has a  striped cat that appears in several illustrations of the boy growing up. In  his house, there is a kitten, that grows into a cat, that turns into a  rather large, well-fed cat by the end of the story. <br />        Not only am  I sharing this book with my kids, but I gave my mom a copy for Mother's  Day.
B00000J7JO|4.0|This review may be a little after the fact... I've had this album for a year or so now, and I'm finding more and more reason to like it every day. It's probably the best Chilli Peppers CD since &quot;Mothers Milk&quot; and  quite possibly the best ever. The musicianship is just stunning. Everyone  is in top form and the band is really locked into a rock-solid groove.  &quot;Parallel Universe&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;  are absolute classics... and, there isn't a truly weak song on the record  (unlike &quot;one hot minute&quot; which had its moments but also sagged  badly in spots). This is one of the most exciting rock albums I've heard in  years... or ever, for that matter. They sound very mature but not washed  up. It's the maturity that seperates them from the lousy kiddie parade of  Korn and Limp Bizkit... &quot;Californication&quot; is a true classic of  modern rock which hearkens back to brighter times (early-mid 90's) in the  world of major-label music. One of the very few major label releases I've  bought in the last few years.
0060975768|5.0|I read this book in a single sitting, staying up all night to finish it. The author's word pictures are compelling. If it is possible to capture the horror of war, he has done it. One of the best Vietnam books I have ever  read.
B000002KOG|5.0|I've been an active fan of Neil Young since 1964.  My favorite ballad of his is &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (City of Brotherly Love), and my favorite rocker is still &quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot; off of this  album.<br />In my opinion, this is still his finest album, beginning to end.   Every cut is thoroughly excellent, and you can't say that about any of his  other albums (even though most of them have unforgettable songs on them and  are worth a good listen).  Never forget how great this album was when it  was released.  Only Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; and Pink  Floyd's debut album were more powerful and influential (and the Beatles and  Stones certainly held serve).  But, &quot;Neil Young&quot; still holds its  own with such as these.
6302238331|5.0|Brilliant.  Contains one of the three best chase scenes ever filmed (the other two occuring in Bullit and French Connection II).  I absolutely love the ending to this movie.  Indeed, as a another reviewer points out, it was  haunting (same for the ending to French Connection II).  Gene Hackman's  performance is flawless.  This is just another fine example of the amazing  filmmaking that occured between the years 1969 and 1975.  Awesome, pure,  unfettered, and raw.  Ahhh, if we could only have movies like this made  today ...
0812580346|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from Mr. Sawyer.  I had not read any of his works.  I picked up this book and could hardly put it down.  The story line is fascinating. The only thing I did not care for was how it ended.  I got  a bit lost in the &quot;scientific&quot; concept of time switching, and why  it could not be done again.  But, in all the book was a great read, and a  roller coaster in development. Enjoy!
0792838912|5.0|Mickey has never looked better- before or after this flick.  Kim's vulnerability and weirdly, off-kilter, shy sensuality gives the movie its heart.  Well acted, beautifully filmed, great music.  My two favorite  scenes:  the butcher shop when they first encounter each other, and the  flea market scene, filmed in Greenwich village, when he surprises her with  the expensive scarf she was eyeing, but could not afford.  Ahhh, so  romantic ...
B000002UAF|4.0|This album by the Beatles represents a pinnacle of success of that period of rock and roll.  It may not have the creativity and innovative style of some of the later albums, but as plain old rock and roll it's hard to beat  this album.  It kicks from the very beginning and is just filled with great  chords and rock songs.  &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; is of course a  favorite among many, myself included, but that is one of many great songs  on this album.
B00003BDXG|5.0|While this movie has endured its share of flack, the more open-minded viewer will automatically realize that this movie's end result is not glorifying violence, but rather it tells the blunt message that our society  feeds upon viloence. Where violence has come across as entertaining in most  films, this keeps the violence true to the culture. By making an  off-the-wall violent movie, Oliver Stone has hit home the direct message of  what he was trying to say; &quot;You, the consumer, are the reason why  there are trashy shows on television.&quot; The movie takes apart consumer  stupidity and media havoc. It clearly meant to show just how incredibly out  of hand the blitz can get. We see shows today that idolize crime and the  criminals that commit them, and under all of this is the festering wound  that grows as the media becomes more and more chaotic. By using the film  from the perspective of the killers, it shows the rest of the world just as  completely numb to the surroundings as the criminals. The talk show host,  the warden, the fans, they all are just as posessed by this hunger for  recognition and fame. Because, in America, fame is the only recognition.  The movie is so brutally honest, and so unflinchingly in-your-face that you  will either love it, or hate it. But either way, you can't ignore it.
B000002UB6|5.0|This is definitely not the Beatles best album but there is one reason that I still give it five stars.  It has one of the greatest songs of all time on it.  The title track &quot;Let It Be&quot; is simply magnificent and  that alone is enough that this album deserves to be in any collection.  The  soulful and wanting sounds of this song truly move my soul more than any  other song I can think of.  Given all that the rest of the songs are still  fairly good and though they may not be as good as many other Beatles albums  this album is still worth it, in that it is still better than most other  music you will find out there.
630451087X|5.0|I enjoy watching this movie at night. This way it feels as though you are trapped inside of an amazing Dream Scenario that you can't find your way out of. That is why this movie is one of the most entertaining films ever  made. You can lose yourself in its atmosphere, like being in a trance that  you hope you never have to leave.  This movie, like all of David Lynch's  movies, is refreshingly original. You will never find another movie like  this ever. This is one of a kind. Don't try to figure out just what has  happened. You are left just as confused as when you started, but that's the  nature of it. The mysteries aren't revealed and are open to analysis, but  trying to pick it apart takes away the magic. I like it when a movie leaves  you breathless and curious. This way you can watch it again, and again. It  never gets old. This movie may not be for all tastes, but for those who  appreciate David Lynch, this is the most fun you may ever have when you  watch a movie.
B00003XACV|4.0|This soundtrack evokes the emotions of the film better than just about any other soundtrack I can imagine, especially given the complexity of emtotions that this film provokes.  Nonetheless the music is perfectly  matched to the scenes, and unlike many movies in which the score simply  hides behind all the action and dialogue this score seems to play a game of  counterpoint with the movie often elevating and contrasting scenes that  would not be nearly as powerful if viewed without the soundtrack.  Of  course this CD is also a great work without the movie and would stand by  itself very well.  The music is very original and quite different from  anything else I have heard in modern classical music.
6300213714|5.0|I have watched this movie over 25 times, it never loses it's appeal, very few films let you come back to watch again and again, this is without doubt a classic, never got the acclaim it deserved, and having the female DJ  charting the journey home was a master touch. Please all movie fans you  NEED to watch this to see how film making should be done, my 2nd favourite  film of all time behind 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest'
0800103661|5.0|This film amazed me.  WHY?  I don't watch science fiction too often...I picked this one up mostly because of its interesting cover and Uma Thurman. I will definetely watch more sci-fi from now on...<br />This story is about  human identity: losing it, finding it, and being robbed of it.  Although  the story is set in the future, the film is not overly futuristic unlike  many science-fictions.  In this film, you can actually relate to the story  and its characters; at least, you'd better relate, if you don't want to end  up in the world of &quot;Gattaca&quot;. In a sence, however, we already  live in this world, according to filmmakers's message.<br />The overall  cinematography creates that futuristic feeling, without too many  &quot;special effects&quot;, if any.  Having Uma Thurman as one of the  characters is also a good start for science fiction film...She IS  futuristic.<br />Pairing Ethan Hawke with Jude Law (much more successful, than  pairing Matt Damon with Jude Law in &quot;Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;) is  well-done, too. I don't want to give away more about that, because it is  the most essential part of the plot. But, you are surely to be surprised  (if not shocked).   <br />Despite its harshness, GATTACA, gives viewers (and  the whole human race) certain hope at the end.<br />GATTACA is intiguing,  intelligent, and original film...both visually and contextually. Definite  Cinematic Treat!
0671042858|4.0|This is the first Stephen King book I ever read, and I have to say, I am impressed.  His attention to detail is amazing and his suspense it very good.  He takes the reader down the woods with a little girl and gets her  lost.  What is very cool about this book is where it takes place.  I live  in New Hampshire, and this book takes place on teh New Hampshire/Maine  border (about 20 minutes away from me)and King describes stuff that I  recognize.  It's weird to read about stuff that I know.  Juwst so you know,  for those who are not from New England, King does a great job describing NH  and ME.  Well..all in all, this is a cool book
0800103661|5.0|This film amazed me. WHY? I don't watch many science fiction films.  I picked this one up mostly because of its interesting cover and Uma Thurman.<br />GATTACA is a story about human identity: losing it, finding it, and changing it.

In a sence, however, we already live in this world, according to this film's message.<br />The cinematography creates a futuristic feeling, without any special effects.

I don't want to give away the plot but you will be surprised, I guarantee. <br />Despite its harshness, GATTACA, gives viewers certain hope at the end.  GATTACA is an intriguing, intelligent, and original film.  A Cinematic Treat!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Just when I thought it was impossible for a movie to capture the nuances of a well-crafted novel, David Fincher comes along and proves me wrong.  Fincher, the director, shows again his ability to mold a movie like clay,  to shape it into whatever style is necessary to convey its dark, moral  shape.  The cast backs him up with intensity and bravado.<br />&quot;Fight  Club,&quot; as implied by the title, is not for the faint-of-heart, for the  self-appointed morality squads, or for those interested in mere  entertainment...This movie wants to say something--and, in case you're hard  of hearing, it'll even yell out its sermonettes at times.  No, not every  lesson hits home.  Some fly off the mark, and some get lost behind the  violent foreground--but others hit you like a bullet between the  eyes.<br />Jack begins as an insomniac, &quot;not really asleep, and not  really awake.&quot;  As he finds himself addicted to the close-knit feeling  of support groups, he becomes an emotional junkie, attending meeting after  meeting with bogus ailments--anything for his next hug, his next  &quot;fix.&quot;  These scenes, though humorous at times, touch on deep  felt longings and feelings in us all. But when Jack realizes that another  person, Marla Singer, is also using the groups for her own devices, his  ecstasy is shattered.  His own shallowness, reflected through her, becomes  a thorn in his side.<br />Jack begins losing sleep again...Until he meets  Tyler Durden.  Soon, the two inseparable partners commit themselves to an  anti-social life, pursuing answers and meaning in a world ruled by  capitalistic emptiness.  &quot;The things you own... own you!&quot; Tyler  declares.  And the two set out to be free men by casting aside most things  society holds dear.<br />Their intentions and their courage to cast aside  convention in the pursuit of a better way left me simultaneously stunned  and cheering and repulsed.

B00004TLMC|3.0|Machine called Hollywood. Many  viewers felt cheated and frustrated; they are ready to trash this film. These people should be angry, but not at the author.  People, who do not usually watch Kubrick, fell for the promise of sex. Well, guess what? There is no sex, not really....This film is not about orgies or sexual excesses. These elements were used as metaphors for frailty of human mind and social excesses. The opening scene shows Cruise and Kidman rushing off to some &quot;socializing event&quot;, leaving their young daugther with a baby-sitter. So, there you have it-a moral. Another moral comes when Cruise is wearing a mask in certain scenes. As Oscar Wilde put it: &quot;Give the man a mask, and he will show you his face&quot;.  I think Kubrick was striving to demonstrate that.<br />I like the film, but the ads called it &quot;Kubrick's best film&quot;. It is not. This may be his last film, but definitely not the best one. I also did not like some very long shots and Kubrick's choice of Cruise and Kidman for their respective roles. I do realize that these things might be flaws only in my subjective view.  Still, I give this film 3 stars. <br />Watch this film, but don't expect too much... If you generally don't like Kubrick's films, then don't waste your time on this one. If you want to learn about his films, then start with the earlier films first.
0553108034|5.0|If I hear &quot;Jordanitus&quot; one more time I am going to puke!  People, quit condeming others for Jordan's sins as a bad writer.  If the writing continues as it is - I would love nothing more than this series to  go on and on.  Every chapter is filled with intrigue that progresses the  story as well as defines characters - Martin is a master of storytelling,  plot development, story movement, and character greyness.  Whereas Martin  delivers a lavish meal that you feel guilty for having so much goodness,  Jordan offers crumbs until you become so warped that crumbs begin to look  like feasts and you thank Jordan for them.  Do not compare these  authors...Martin spoils the reader while Jordan spoils the series - that is  the only comparison.  <br />So what if Martin describes in detail the food  they are eating - that is the talent of a true author - to set you into the  story and make you feel apart of it...food is very important to a reader,  and your comment on Martin liking food himself is also shameful.  <br />This  is the best Fantasy Series I have ever read - sitting next to The Lord of  the Rings, and just above Leiber's Fafhrd and Mouser series...this series  will change your life.
0790729725|3.0|The UK disc is also a flipper.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece!  I hope that you all enjoy it and appreciate it as I do&gt;
B00003CWRX|3.0|I expected this movie to be a bunch of bussiness and interviews nothing special. But this moviw was grate. And it is strange and a little sad seeing what this man had to go threw with his story. I mean this is a true  story and I dont actually usually like true stories they are about somebody  there lifes are boring and then they think they can turn it in to a movie  and it will be incheresting I dont think so. But this one was and I say  this is a must see movie.
B00004R960|4.0|Ok, so if all you Oasis kids are listening out there, this album is pretty darn good. Yes, I expected another, &quot;Definetly Maybe&quot;, but come on, we're all in need for a change, right? I have no complaints about this  except for track #5 &quot;Little James&quot; (Liam is god in my book and I  love him to death, but Noel is the songwriter and he is the singer and it  should stay that way). They took a huge leap from the last album and I have  to say that that is why they will always be my favorite band--because they  reinvent themselves musically and lyrically (cheers to Noel). And Liam  still has the most unique sounding voice that there is in music today in my  opinion (Liam is my baby! ) &quot;Roll it over&quot; is a song that I think  everyone can relate to, &quot;Gas Panic&quot; is one of those songs that  you can't stop listening to (trust me, I should know :) ), and in my  opinion, &quot;Sunday Morning Call&quot; touched me on a personal level (it  will to you too, I'm sure). If you're a true fan than you will appreciate  this album. If you're not, then you have no idea what you've been missing.  All the doubters have said, &quot;Oh, they're trying to be like the  Beatles, screw them&quot;, but I'll tell you what. Every band that is out  today has gotten some style from another band before them....Oasis is the  only band that has the balls to admit it....Cheers
B00004SCX6|5.0|thias is a way way cool CD i especially love the song &quot;Lucky&quot; cuz it relates to many stars' lives.  buy it man cuz you'll luv it.
B000002AS3|5.0|Although I am a little late on this review, I must say that this is by far the best Oasis album put out to this day. They say that it's hard to top the previous album, and that's true, but what other band has been able to  accomplish that? Not many---and as far as I'm concerned Oasis will be my  favorite band until I croak--so here's my advice: if you're going to buy an  Oasis album, this is the one you need to get. If you even like only one  Oasis song than you need to get this album. Noel Gallagher's songwriting  skills were fresh and new to the public and took the world by storm--maybe  not America but to me it did. Not many people here gave it a chance but I  tell ya, if you do you will not regret it. My fav. tracks are &quot;Live  Forever&quot;(hence the screenname), &quot;Supersonic&quot;,  &quot;Cigarettes and alcohol&quot; (cheers!) and my favorite Oasis song  from here on out, &quot;Slide Away&quot;. But I'm telling you, this entire  album is tops in my book and if you buy it..you will not be sorry..I  guarantee you that..cheers!  :)
B00004THAY|5.0|great, a classic.  clapton is at his best, better than &quot;blues&quot; and king is always a knockout
B00004U3UG|5.0|Army of Darkness is a perfect blend of comedy and horror.  This is the thrid movie of the Evil Dead series which stars Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead, Hercules, Jack of All Trades, Maniac Cop, Down Periscope, and more) and is  directed by Sam Raimi (Darkman, For Love of the Game, The Quick and the  Dead, and more).  Army of Darkness is a top notch film that goes from being  original to genius.  Bruce Campbell gets thrown back in time and the only  way he can get home is by obtaining the Necronomicon (The Book of the  Dead).  Along his quest he encounters hilarious enemies and situations.  I  have not met a person yet that has not enjoyed this film thoroughly from  sheer fascination, hysterical laughter, or both!  Superb acting, excellent  direction/producing, hysterically funny special effects.  HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED!
B00000760T|4.0|This album takes me back to the days of yore...pure pop mixed with yearning ballads
B00003CX95|5.0|I'm not a &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; fan and I normally don't coo and carry on about Mel Gibson, but his performance in this film blew me away.<br />When Gibson got the Oscar for best director and the movie got the Oscar for best  picture, I was thinking, &quot;what?&quot; I hadn't seen the film yet and I  thought it was just some grandiose tale w/ Gibson showing off his long hair  and rippling muscles or something. It just looked stupid to me and I wasn't  interested in seeing the film from the trailers.<br />After everyone made such  a big deal over the film, I figured I'd rent it and see what the commotion  was about.  It is a beautiful film and I wish I had seen it on the big  screen.  Gibson's performance is stellar. You easily get emotionally  involved with the characters in this film, which really helps you to forget  that this is indeed a movie you're watching and not an experience you're  having.<br />The film is based on William Wallace, one of Scottland's greatest  heros. While Wallace was a real character, I've heard commentary that this  film deviates from history on almost every account of this man.  Wallace  was almost all but forgotten until this movie came out, however, and even  historians were applauding the film for bringing more interest in William  Wallace.<br />The battle scenes are exciting and the emotional struggles in  the film ranging from first love to seeing friends and love ones being  executed runs high through out.  Even the ending, while tragic, is poignant  and beautiful... the Oscars won for this film were honorably earned.
0451169514|5.0|I've read many supposedly scarey books but, none can compare.  &quot;IT&quot; left me in fear every night before I went to bed.  I've never been so terrified in my entire life.  But then the relationship  between the 7 protagionists make you feel like you can get through this  book if they can.  I would not advise reading this if you are young.  If  you want a good scare... just start reading IT.
B00003CX5A|3.0|Christopher Walken is the icing on the cake for this film... he is always perfect in every role he's cast for, and he's great in this film for the small amount of time he's in it.<br />The rest of the cast are also masters of  their craft and do a superb job.<br />It was hard to get emotionally involved  with the characters, however, so it was hard to really enjoy the film the  way it was intended.<br />I love Tim Burton's work and I was excited to see  this movie. He stayed true to the spirit of the original story in many  respects and kept you guessing and on your toes for a while... but the  movie languished and it was pretty flat when it was all over.<br />There is  one awesome scene, in which you see the headless horseman exiting his  hidden lair... seeing that just once almost makes the movie worth seeing  (almost).<br />I'm not sure what was missing, but something was. The film was  good at startling the audience in many places and the costumes and  backdrops were excellent... a feast for the eyes for this genre.  I can't  imagine ever seeing this film again, however... it just left too much to be  desired.  There were a few light, humorous moments that were sadly too few  and far between in the film.  After seeing a film by Burton like &quot;Ed  Wood,&quot; and knowing what he is capable of, this film was a  disappointment.
0886464935|5.0|Peter Whitman does an outstanding job of reading Catch-22.  The individual character voices are easily identifiable and very entertaining. I listen to 1-2 audio books each week and this one stands out as my favorite.  Whether  you are familiar with the story or not, I highly recommend giving the audio  version a listen.
B00003CWL5|5.0|The standout star is Wes Bentlley. He is absolutely AMAZING in \\"American Beauty\\". He is definitely on the road to superstardom. His deep, piercing blue eyes caputre the lovable weirdness of Ricky Fitts  completely. Sure, Kevin Spacey/Annette Bening were great in the film and  worthy of their Oscar attention, but it's Wes that steals the show. Overall: the movie is a great example of a dark comedy.
078324228X|1.0|&quot;The Hurricane&quot; is not a good movie. With it's myriad of inaccuracies, it's biased approach to a real life situation, and it's utterly bland technique at story-telling, there isn't much here that you  can't find in a tv movie of the week. Basically, they santize all of the  ugly aspects of Reuben Carter's life, portray all the real life people  involved as one-dimensional heroes and villains, and throw in some  appallingly corny lines in hope to maniuplate the viewer. It infuriates me  see that people think Denzel Washington was more deserving of the Oscar  than Kevin Spacey, whose performance was a thousand times better. Not to  disparage Mr. Washington's acting skills, but it cannot compare to the kind  of power and depth Spacey's conveyed so memorably. If you want to watch a  movie that doesn't provoke or excite anything in you, watch this one, and  consider yourself lucky if it fades from your memory soon after it's over.
B000002L7V|2.0|This album is just a filler in Dios amazing discography...AFter &quot;HOly Diver&quot; it was hard to keep the pace, but he almost did that in &quot;Last in Line&quot;. LAter, guitarrist Vivian Campbell left the  band and Dio started a perigrination through an amazing number of different  guitarrists.
B00004THAY|5.0|A great combination of 2 of the worlds greatest musicians. This is sure to be a classic, and I highly recomend it. It makes a fine addition to any music collection.
B000002KMY|3.0|The weakest member (technically speaking) is Sabbath was always drummer Bill Ward. In this CD, he left the band for medical reasons, and was replaced by Dios pal Vinnie Appice (brother of famous drummer Carmine  Appice). He joined the band without trouble, but the bands cretaivity in  compositions was already very reduced at this stage... The result is only a  few good songs, like &quot;Turn Up the Night&quot; and &quot;Falling of  the...&quot; If youre a true Sabbth fan, youll realize that &quot;Heaven  and Hell&quot; is much, much better, and was the last worthwhile Sabbath  album...
B00004THAY|5.0|I great combination of the 2 of the worlds finest musicians! I highly recomend this item. It makes a great addition to any CD collecion
B00003W8NM|5.0|Best movie ever made.  I thought this movie looked dumb, but then one of my friends saw it and said it was awesome and was able to convince me to go see, which I did.  I loved it!  I loved it so much, I saw it again, which  is very rare.  This is a must buy.  I dunno how someone cannot love this  movie.  If you have not seen it, at  least rent it.
B00004THAY|5.0|Excellent CD!   E.C. and B.B. are two of the best and it definitely shows here!
0140288503|5.0|This book is such a fast-paced read that you won't be able to put it down. This tells the story that infuriated so many Americans back in 1993, when an American pilot was dragged through the streets of Somalia on TV. This  was the pilot of the crashed Black Hawk helicopter. This story is so well  written and I would gladly read anything else Bowden writes. This also  tells of the extreme odds the soldiers faced against the paople of Somalia.  Even civilians had weapons and were shooting at the soldiers. The American  forces were grossly outnumbered. This book is one of the best I have read  and I am certainly recommending it.
B00002DE2L|1.0|Did I miss something? The best thing about this CD is the photograph on the cover. I've heard worse versions of The Four Seasons but only on budget  labels.<br />There are some good moments but overall the band sounds like it  needs a lot more practice. Ms Mutter plays Vivaldi and Vivaldi loses. You  can almost hear the Trondheimers struggling, and not always managing, to  keep pace. At times, the production is reduced to a mush of sound.  This  recording probably sounds a lot better on the radio or a cheap CD player  than on a decent sound system. Perhaps that's what the production team was  aiming for. Vivaldi for commuters.
B00004THAY|4.0|I just bought this today and have listened to it twice already at my desk. I am glad I bought it, it is what you would expect from Eric Clapton. It is truly a pleaseure to listen to. The title track is real nice, pay attention  to the lyrics, they are special. The best song is Ten Long Years, it is  truly awesome. Eric Clapton again proves why he is absolutely one of the  classics of guiter rock.
B00004T8RK|4.0|In some respects, I think Yield is a better album, but Binaural still suffices for greatness. Binuaral contains three songs that are not Pearl Jam caliber, though they sound to be at first--God's Dice, Sleight of Hand,  and Long Road 2, Parting Ways.  Thriteen songs in the album, minus 3, equal  10, all of which are songs that could be played over and over again--some  may argue for God's Dice--and I'm not say that it is bad either. The  strength of the album is its quirkiness, and the band being able to compose  songs that have natural sound to them. I think that's been key to their  success. Key words that loom in Binaural are quirkiness,as in Rival and  Soon Forget, supressed rage, as heard in Greivance, and mind-playing  guitars that seem to want to spin into something off of Vs. but instead  retain driving composure as in Of the Girl, Insignificance. What can you  say? Vedder and the boys just keeping doing it . . .
0425170349|5.0|I am a 11 year old boy. I read this book because I knew that Tom Clancy was good (read the Sum of All Fears), and that Rainbow Six was on a SWAT commando style topic.<br />The book begins with an exciting plane hostage situation, where the stars of the book, and also the members of Rainbow  Six, an international elite force designed to eliminate terrorists across  the globe, are on board the plane as it happens.<br />Then, Clancy describes  the training in full detail, while still keeping it exciting.<br />The first  &quot;official&quot; mission of Rainbow Six is a terrorist threat in  Switzerland. Clancy spends a while on this one, but again keeps it  exciting.<br />I won't give away the rest, because why read a review when  you've already read it?
0064471837|5.0|I cannot express, in words, how much I truly loved this book.  After reading a great book, I alway fall into a sort of a stupor and state of boredom because there is no book for me to read.  Right now, I don't know what I am going to do the rest of my life now that the book is done.  Everyone, including men, should try to be just like Sabriel!  She is so  much like a real person and everything she does is either through her love  for her lost father or for the good of other people.  The plot in this book  was truly amazing and unlike any other I have ever read.  My favorite  author used to be Clive Cussler but now it has just switched to GARTH  NIX!
B00004SCX6|5.0|This was a great album!She had a great voice on this album and she had great songs. I can tell she tried really hard. I really reccomend this  album!
0783117388|5.0|I'm a very happy woman.  Now, that I have &quot;Sex in the City&quot; as part of my own personal collection I'm thrilled.  This wonderfully funny, sexy and amazingly acted HBO show is my favorite.  There is NOTHING else  like it.  NO WHERE.   The cast of four female characters is wonderful.   Sarah Jessica Parker is a wonderful Carrie and I just love Kim Catrell as  Samantha.  This amazing show is brought to TV from the great book by  Candance Bushnell's wildly popular book by the same name.  To be honest I  have been a longtime fan of the book and was worried that TV couldn't do it  justice...well, I was wrong.  Dead wrong.  This show has gone beyond what I  could have hoped for.  I love watching these four ladies as they make their  lives threw New York City.  It gives us (from the midwest..etc) as chance  to live threw them.  And, it's such a great.<br />*And, if NOTHING else, the  romance and chemistry between Carrie and Big to do die for.  Chris Noth is  a brilliant addition to a &quot;woman friendly&quot; world.  He's just  wonderful. <br />Buy it...Buy it NOW!
0590353403|5.0|Harry Potter rules!The plot line is hilarious. For instance, Harry unleashes a Boa Constrictor that had never seen South America on his bratty cousin Dudley. Harry's best friend Ron has twin brothers who always make  wise cracks like mixing their names up into gred &amp; forge instead of  Fred and George. Another time in a game of Quiditch, Harry nearly swallowed  a snitch which is a small walnut sized, very fast flying ball with wings.  The plot line is always surprising, sometimes incredibly normal and  sometimes just plain old wierd.
B000002H33|5.0|It's obvious to anyone that there are two Metallica camps. One is for those who remember the good old days when MTV and Metallica were strangers, the other is for fans of kiddie metal. In the eighties, Metallica was still  pretty much underground even with the release of 'Puppets'. If you wore  your 'Metal up your A$$' T-shirt to high school you were in a very small  cliche, where everyone listening to White Lion and Poisen had no clue and  no business. You see Metallica only had three albums, the last one being  Master of Puppets. You can tell a real Metallica album because the  bassist's initials are C.B. Who's that you say? Nevermind go listen to  Enter Sandman and think you know what metal is.<br />Master of Puppets is a  masterpiece work which they couldn't repeat no matter how much money you  threw at them (hey, maybe THAT'S the problem). It is one of those rare  albums where every song, every note, and every lyric fit perfectly and has  a place. SPeaking as a guitar player, this album is musically intelligent,  difficult, and is no easy task to cover in a bar band. 'Orion' is probably  Metallica's most under-rated work to date. The title track, Battery,  ....... oh he11 the whole album is PERFECT, no sense trying to find bright  points when the whole record is a supernova. Never to be repeated by these  sellouts, Metallica's Master of Puppets will go down in the history of  metal, hard rock, and music itself as an oasis to where artists of today  and the future come for inspiration. RIP Cliff, there are those who haven't  forgotten.
B00004THAY|5.0|Well have you? This audio sensory experience is sure to take you there. With the mixture of Clapton's over-driven Strat complimenting B.B's thick, fat Les Paul, there isi just no audio experience like it. The album is  prophetic of what you experience as these guys really are the king's of  their profession. One criticism you might say was that there is a lack of  diversity, but who needs that when you've got this! I would pick a  favourite track but their all so damn good that I couldn't chose. A  definitwe must!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears was one of my favorite singers before I got her new CD, but now that I've heard it, I'm even more sure. I really like her songs, and I think she has a lot of talent. GO BRITNEY!
6302820448|5.0|Okay, so I'm neither a man nor a weather-forecaster.  Still, the first time I saw this movie back in the 80's, I knew it was about my life.  Back in those days, I couldn't understand why nothing was going the way I  thought it should, no matter how hard I tried to bend and twist my will and  that of others to fit my plan. Ah, the ego - it is a marvelous  misconception.<br />Our hero, Phil Connor (Bill Murray), has enough ego to  choke - well, certainly to choke any interest the lovely Andie MacDowell  might have in him when they end up trapped in a small town in the middle of  a blizzard, on GroundHog Day.<br />For her, it's a one day event. Heck, for  everyone but Phil, it's a one day event.  But Phil - well, Phil wakes up  again and again to the sound of &quot;I've Got You Babe&quot; - same day,  same people and the only way things change is when Phil's behavior changes.<br />Unfortunately for Phil, but fortunately for those of us watching this  movie, it takes him several wake-up calls before he gets it.  I've tried  figuring out how many years these repeated days add up to - but I can't and  it doesn't really matter.<br />Some of us learn slowly, and when we are in  the midst of 'getting it', this movie is a comfort.  We're not the only  ones! There's hope!<br />An under-appreciated movie, and Bill Murray is the  perfect star.  He manages to be obnoxious and unlikeable in the beginning,  and even if you don't like his style much (I really am not a Bill Murray  fan), you end up liking the guy in the end.  This is a great movie to watch  when you're feeling down, stuck in life,  and need some hope and  encouragement.
B00004TH6O|5.0|If you have any connections with the British music press like me, then you will have read in the New Musical Express that they thought that this album was the most important and anticipated underground rock album since  &quot;Nevermind&quot; - can there possibly be any higher praise than that?  The answer is yes and no. The reason for it not being 'entirely' correct is  that you cannot rank anything made by the Queens of the Stone Age over  Kyuss, but at the same time the statement is accurate in that Kyuss never  got noticed, unlike the Queens are now, and since the Queens have risen  from the ashes of Kyuss (although with a COMPLETELY different sound), then  this IS probably the most anticipated underground rock album for many a  year. <br />So, with a huge sigh of relief and joy, I can kindly inform all of  you that this album is majestic. On my first listen, the record just about  reduced me to tears at how great it was. There's the irresistible punk  infused drug anthem &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot;, the dark and  twisted psychedelic pop tunes &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret&quot;,  &quot;Monsters in the Parasol&quot; - a brilliant reworking of a desert  sessions track -and the weird and quirky &quot;Leg of Lamb&quot;. Then  there is the quite franky sublime guest appearance by Mark Lanegan of the  great Screaming Trees on the heart-melting &quot;In the Fade&quot; which  has one of the best guitar chorus lines I've ever heard. Or how about the  hallucinogenic and timeless beauty of &quot;Auto Pilot&quot;, &quot;Better  Living Through Chemistry&quot; and &quot;I Think I Lost my Headache&quot;.  &quot;Auto Pilot&quot; actually has a very David Bowie ring about it,  showing how far this band is willing to push their boundaries. <br />The  Queens don't stop there, though. No, sir. &quot;Quick and to the  Pointless&quot; and &quot;Tension Head&quot; are two of the maddest and  most inspired punk rock songs I've ever heard. The former includes a riotgirl chant that goes &quot;Yeah!Yeah!Yeah!&quot; - with handclaps. The  latter being a driving, trashy b*&amp;ch of a song about the morning after  the night before. Both are mental, and both are genius.<br />Indeed, this  whole album doesn't have anything that can be compared to it. Their debut  album indicated their musical vision i.e. Josh Homme's vision and the  product of many years of hard work by one of the greatest guitarists of our  generation and his co-conspirators is this. One of the most perfectly  realised rock albums ever made.
0425129616|4.0|This is Agatha Chritie's firt novel and Hercule Poirot's first case. It's also a great read. I was first introduced to Agatha Chritie in sixth grade by my gifted teacher, and have been a Poirot fan ever since--I did a book  report on a Ms. Marple book, but decided later that that  funny little  Belgian gent was more my type. Christie creates a wondeful and entertaining  character in Hercule Poirot. He's conceited in a funny way, immaculately  groomed, and brilliant in solving crimes; he also has a way of dropping  subtle and interesting crumbs along the way and not revealing all he know  until the end. Christie never fails to surprise, either, as to who the  perpatrator is. This ending is truly the last you'd expect. The Queen of  the mystery genre (says who? me, that's who) is at her most wonderful prime  in this delightful first novel. It's inriguingly written, the characters  are great, and it is short. A must read.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Granted, I did enjoy her debut, ...Baby One More Time, but alot of the songs featured on that CD were alike (with few exceptions). I just purchased this CD today and there are a few similiarities. For instance,  What U See and Lucky have the same beat as Oops! and Stronger. But that's  all. This CD is great! Here's my little review.<br />Oops!...I Did It Again:  This is the song! You can always come dance. But, I hate the Titanic scene.  4/5<br />Stronger: Awesome! Great beat, love the start and stop. A sure hit  for Brit Brit. 5/5<br />Don't Go Knockin' On My Door: this is an OK  song...Britney tries her cards on R&amp;B, and does a pretty good job on  it! 4/5<br />Satisfaction: I don't know why everybody hates this. I love it! I  love the way it goes from soft to hard pop. 5/5<br />Don't Let Me Be The Last  to Know: I love this song so much. Written by Shania and her husband, this  song boasts a small hint of country, dosed into a pop ballad. LUV IT!  5/5<br />What U See (Is What You Get): Pretty good. Although the beat gets a  little awkward, it's a great song anyway :)<br />Lucky: THE BOMB DIGGITY SONG!  This is a definite hit for Britney! IF IT'S NOT, I WILL SUE THE RADIO! THIS  IS A 10000/5 song!<br />One Kiss From You: Basically the only song that sounds  like Thinkin' About You and Soda Pop. I'm not feelin it 2 much, but it's  ok. 3/5<br />Where Are You Now: I really am feeling this song, and it's just a  great soft ballad. 5/5<br />Can't Make You Love Me: Not gettin into this song,  although it's kinda fun. 3/5<br />When Your Eyes Say It: More like the last,  but a little better. 4/5<br />Dear Diary: Britney's first song. AWWW? Not  exactly. It's ok, but it's a little too &quot;teenag-like&quot;. Know what  I mean? For instance. Here's some lyric samples (Dear Diary/Today I saw a  boy/And I wonder if he noticed me/Dear diary/he took my breath away/I  thought as if my heart could fly/) It's ok...4/5<br />Overall, this is a  really great CD! If you find it ata good price, don't hesitate to buy it!  I luv it! :)
B0000033IS|5.0|Aretha Franklin always had the tools.  She was the daughter of a minister and grew up singing in the church.  She could also play a mean piano, whether slow and soulfully, or fast and rollicking.  At the age of 18 she  signed with Columbia Records.  For the next 6 years, she recorded a huge  body of work, ranging from jazz and blues, to standards and pop, to  straight R&amp;B and soul.  The label didn't seem to know what to do with  her, in terms of consistent direction.  But all of that dues-paying singing  Aretha did in those early years would soon pay off in a big way.  When her  CBS contract expired, Atlantic Records snapped her up faster than you can  say &quot;Gold Records.&quot;  The rest, as they say, is history.  This  album changed things all at once for Aretha.  Its release proved to be both  a coming-out party and a coronation.  And a singer who, to that point, was  considered an also-ran amidst the landscape of soul-singing Sisters, took  her rightful place as The Queen of Soul.  It is a place she still holds  today.  No one could do it like Aretha!  This landmark set contained two  singles that changed the face of pop music.  The title cut set the tone  with its first biting line:  &quot;You're a no good heartbreaker!&quot;  But, of course, Aretha loves him.  In that way, she was like a lot of other  women, especially Black women.  That's really the key to Aretha's success:  she knows how to talk to women.  Sisterhood has really always been where  she was coming from.  The next single, &quot;Respect,&quot; is considered  by most to be the greatest pop single of all time.  Which is amazing,  considering that its writer, Otis Redding, had a big R&amp;B hit with the  song only 2 years prior.  The story goes that when Otis first heard  Aretha's version, he told his producer, &quot;That girl done stole my  song!&quot;  He was right.  Aretha, singing and playing her heart out, was  all over &quot;Respect.&quot;  She demanded her propers not only for  herself, but for Black women, for women worldwide, for Black people, and  for oppressed people everywhere.  The album's third single, &quot;Do Right  Woman, Do Right Man,&quot; is another classic.  And this deep, deep set  also contains favorites like &quot;Don't Let Me Lose This Dream&quot; and  &quot;Soul Serenade.&quot;  And Aretha showcases all she learned singing  the blues at CBS, with her self-penned &quot;Dr. Feelgood,&quot; which is  still one of her biggest numbers at live shows.  One listen to this song,  and you can't help but say, &quot;Right on, Sister!&quot; or &quot;You go,  Girl!&quot;  In case you don't know, this album routinely makes the top ten  of lists of the best albums ever.  I rank it just behind &quot;What's Going  On&quot; by Marvin Gaye, as the second-best soul album of all-time.lf, but for Black women, for women worldwide, for Black people, and  for oppressed people everywhere.

B00004THAY|5.0|Excellent. Anyoone who appreciates quality blues and the sweet guitars sounds of these masters will love this collection of classic songs.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|A-ha have always been (certainly in the UK) the most under-rated group I know of.  This is a tremendous come back album and worth all of the 7 long years of wait.  Surely &quot;You'll Never Get Over Me&quot; and &quot;The  Sun Never Shone That Day&quot; are stand out tracks but it really is hard  to put one above another.  The only real disappointment lies in &quot;I  Won't Forget Her&quot; and even that is not bad.  &quot;Thought That It Was  You&quot; sounds like it was excluded from Morten's solo album so no  suprises that it's his song then.  Truly a triumph. Come on WEA get some  decent promotion going in the UK.  This deserves to be heard and judging by  Summer Moves On performance of 1 week in the Top 40 (criminal) they need to  get radio on side. Buy it Try it You'll love it.
0792833236|1.0|Boring...pretentious...navel-gazing<br />Just a few ways to describe this incredibly over-hyped movie. I sat down with some friends expecting to see a good film, hoping I'd get the Scorcese who directed Goodfellas and not  the Scorcese who directed The Colour of Money. Well after sitting through  hours of this sleep-inducing cypher of a film, I realised I had got  something much worse. I still don't understand what all the fuss is about.  The plot is pretty simple - supposedly about a great but flawed boxer, it's  really about a selfish bum who cheats on his wife, knocks his girlfriend  around, beats up his brother, then fades from whatever &quot;glory&quot; he  once had into a life of pot-bellied obscurity. Whopee, just what the world  needs - another film about a selfish, greedy, stupid *loser*. <br />Why do I  hate this film so much? I hate the characters, none of whom have any  redeeming features whatsoever. I hate the artificial and pretentious black  &amp; white. I hate the ludicrous boxing scenes. I hate the moronic and  self-indulgent religious imagery. So Scorcese is a devout catholic? Well  the Pope is too but does that make this a good film? I think not. <br />I  really can't believe everyone has given this film 5 stars. Looks like  another case of &quot;oh, all the critics like it, so it must be a great  movie&quot;. &quot;I coulda been a contender,&quot; laments the lead  character at the end of the film. Sure buddy, and Porky Pig coulda learned  to fly. Exploiting this line from a *genuine* classic is just the last  straw. <br />The final verdict? Watching this film the cinematic equivalent of  wading through a cesspit. That said, if you're suffering from insomnia, I  think I might just have found a cure...
B00000JCB2|5.0|One day I was at a friends house. So he got a cd called Limp Bizkit. We listened to it and it was the bomb and if your going to get it edited it's going to stink this cd is the best.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is something that every blues fan in the world wanted to see. I am not talking abaut this CD only but about the whole Clapton-King concept. Here are two of the most influencial musicians in the guitar world united  to show the world the power of the blues. The idea of covering Classic King  tunes just makes this CD more appealing to the buyer. The Song selecction  makes every effort to place each guitarrist in a &quot;conversational&quot;  playing mood with each other and, somehow, it is intended to show respect  to B.B. King as one of America's master of the blues. As for Clapton, he is  probably, along with Stevie Ray Vaughan, the most influencial modern blues  player. Not only his work is inspired in the blues but he has transmitted  this energy to rock in his many groups and solo projects.<br />Key to note  that this is not the first time that Clapton and King have worked together.  Clapton colaborated to King's Dueces Wild CD and they both played on the  Stevie Ray Vaughan Tribute. This prior interaction makes their playing  relationship more solid and the result is stamped on this colecction of  tunes. <br />As I mentioned, this record is a must for any blues lover...
B00004THAY|5.0|Every blues lover dreams of some intense meeting between legends : last year was published a live recording with Albert King ans Stevie Ray Vaughan. This year an excellent brand new studio album : BB &amp; EC. With  the complicity af the young talent of Doyle Brahall II, with Joe Sample  (piano) and Steve Gadd (drums), this CD brings a true dream team together.  What is more impressive is the perfect intricacy between old 12 bars blues  songs and recent songs (from Bramhall's Jellycream), between Clapton's  strat and Lucille, between two different good voices, between styles  (there's even an Isaac Hayes'cover). This CD should put smiles on your  face... PS. Steve Gadd is a genius on drums. Listen to his intense and  judicious job.
B00004T1NA|5.0|PENMANSHIP IS DELIGHTFUL.  PERPETUAL FLOW OF MUSIC. RIGHT TO LEFT, LEFT TO RIGHT. PHARMACEUTICAL MUSIC IT IS. HAVE YOUR DOCTOR GIVE YOU A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT. CAN BE TAKEN WITH TEQUILA,SALT, LEMON AND MOTHER NATURE.ONLY SIDE  EFFECTS ARE PLEASURES. I HOPE FOR STEVE'S AND THE BANDS BENEFIT THAT THIS  BECOMES THIER PHILOSOPHER'S STONE. THESE GUY'S DESERVE IT ALL. A TOUCH OF  FLOYD AND PINK COATED WITH BEATLES, BUT ALL IN ALL IT'S A TRUE PORCUPINE  TREE WORK OF ART.
6304602979|4.0|Wow!  When you mix together a Tarantino script and Tony Scott, you get one unusual film!  Christian Slater is a loser who works in a comic book store. One night he falls in love with a prostitute only to wind up killing her  pimp (Gary Oldman at his most bizarre) the next day and taking off to  California with a briefcase full of cocaine.  But along with this criminal  lovers on the run plot (which works really well here) is an all star cast  which included Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Tom Seizemore,  Chris Penn, Bronson Pinchot, and Val Kilmer (yes, he really is the ghost of  Elvis in this film).  And how else would this movie end than have everyone  end up in one room pointing guns at one another waiting to see who pulls  the trigger first (this scene is very much alike some of John Woo's Hong  Kong films)?  It is a truly unusual film.  Its certainly is not nearly as  good as some of the films Tarantino had up his sleave in the future but it  was a step in the right direction.  All his fans should definately check  this film out.
B00004T1NA|4.0|If fans of the Tree are expecting a return to the more freeform, jam-ish nature of earlier albums like &quot;The sky moves sideways&quot; or &quot;Signify&quot;, they may be disappointed with this carbon-copy of  their most recent release &quot;Stupid Dream&quot;. I, on the other hand,  found &quot;Dream&quot; to be one of my favorite releases of 1999, so I  like the fact that the band has stuck with a more song-oriented approach on  this new one. Having said that, I also find a few of the ideas on this one  to simply not be as fresh and original as the last album. There are moments  on &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; which still send chills down my spine, and  little on this new one makes me feel the same way - in fact, the two  non-album tracks on the &quot;4 Chords&quot; single are better than several  tracks on the actual album. But although a few moments here are just plain  boring and directionless, overall, the songs are melodic and well-crafted,  and better than almost anything out there today - how else do you explain  the fact that they still aren't on a major label?  (I mean, does anyone  care about music like this anymore?) While not the masterpiece the last two  albums were, still a great listen by a great band.
B00004RITP|5.0|This recording by Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic is one of the best Mahler recordings I have heard since the Mahler Second done by  Bernstein and the LSO on CBS Masterworks in the Seventies, with Sheila  Armstrong and Dame Janet Baker.  It is very well performed and also very  well engineered. I suspect it will find its way on to many a Classical CD  of the year list.  If you own a &quot;complete&quot; set of the Mahler  Symphonies you will want to have this recording on the shelf next to the  others. If this performance is any indication, the Berlin Philharmonic is  about to have a golded age. Now if it is not too much to ask how about  doing &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; next.
0440234743|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!   It had adventure, suspense and growth of the human spirit all eveloped under Grisham's usual legal framework.  Although I agree with other reader's that this book differed greatly from  alot of Grisham's other works (with a strong spiritual undertone) I found  it to be a nice addition to the plot, not an annoyance.  The fact that  people can be so closed-minded about the addition of a &quot;deeper  meaning&quot; component to a character's journey in a novel is, in my  opinion, upsetting.  Nontheless, I liked Nate and enjoyed being along for  the ride emersed in the jungles of Brazil.  Very interesting.  I also  thought the Phalen children and their lawyers were a scream.  You hated  them and wanted to see them get nothing, yet at the same time can  understand how they could have become that way.  Great novel.  Fast read!
B00004THAY|5.0|Often enough it is boring listen to guitar heroes playing together in so called super session. But this cd is fun from the first to the last track. B.B. sounds excellent and very energetic and Claptons performance on this  cd is -in my oppinion - the best in the last ten years.
6305807086|4.0|Spike Jonze's debut is one of those strange little unclassifiable movies that come along once in a while. A beautifully surreal, black comedy that plays its increasingly bizarre premise straight-faced. And surely, a  contender for the most original plot of all time.<br />Craig Schwartz is a  struggling street puppeteer who gains employment to help finance his  talents on the mysterious Floor 7 1/2 (with - quite literally - low  overheads). It is here, behind an office filing cabinet, he discovers a  strange portal that leads into (wait for it) the brain of John Malkovich  (playing himself). Out for a quick buck, discovering that whoever crawls  through the doorway becomes the eponymous actor for 15 minutes before being  unceremoniously ejected out onto the side of some New Jersey turnpike,  Schwartz devises the ultimate 'experience', selling trips into the actor's  head for $200. If this isn't weird enough, the plot convolutes further to  accommodate such elements as lesbian love trysts, love triangles (or rather  quadrangles), gender disorientation, chimpanzee childhood trauma flashbacks  and even Malkovich entering his own self  <br />Malkovich's portrayal of his  private off-screen self is self-effacingly superb, and perhaps the bravest  performance to ever grace celluloid; at once, campy, effete, conceited. The  restaurant scene touches on genius.<br />As if Woody Allen (circa: The Purple  Rose of Cairo) had scripted the original Twilight Zone series, this is a  movie of equal parts comedy and tragedy. The dialogue is sharp, witty; the  deeply flawed characters, fully realised (if not identifiable), spiralling  out of control towards an inevitable but creepily effective  denouement.<br />Most of the film's power, however, derives from its realistic  approach to such a ludicrous idea. Its internal logic and cod-psychology  remain intact and wholly believable. <br />Being John Malkovich, although of  an acquired taste, is an undeniably unique and unpredictable voyage of  cinema fantasy. And for much less than $200.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is what every Maiden fan deserves.  Weather you've been a fan all along, joined somewhere along the way, or have never even listened to them before, this cd is for you!   Bruce sounds great with Maiden again and I  can't wait to see them live again!  Trust me on this one...it's a  combination of all of their best works.  If they can continue cranking out  music, they'll be back bigger and better than ever!
B00004THAY|5.0|What can I say, he's the man.  If you love his old stuff this CD is for you.  Not only his he using his classic style, but he riffs with one of the greatest lead guitarists of all time, Eric Clapton.  The harmonized solos  flow perfectly, and these two combine for an almost magical combination.   Great CD, great music...
B00003CWL5|3.0|I did not see this movie when it was in theaters, despite the recommendations of my peers. Recently, I finally got a chance to see it after it had been completely over-hyped. I found it to be a very  high-quality film. Brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, and a  rasor-sharp script made the movie extremely enjoyable. However, reflecting  on the movie as a whole, American Beauty is actually more of a mainstream  wannabe-intellectual movie (although I have to say that Fight Club takes  the cake in terms of mainstream indie movies). To put it quite harshly, I  believe that American Beauty gives the lesser intellectuals something to  latch to and praise. The beauty of the film hides its weak social  commentary very well. So well, in fact, that it picked up a horde of oscars  and gained a quasi-cult following.
B00003W8NM|5.0|After seeing fight club, I was not at all surprised to find that it didn't get a best picture nod for the Oscars, while films such as &quot;the sixth sense&quot; did; however, my complete lack of surprise does not relate my  complete disappointment. This film is an artistic achievement for David  Fincher, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bodham Carter, Chuck Palahniuk,  the Dust Brothers, and all others involved. It scratches at the soft  underbelly of status quo in so many ways. The basic plot of a mentally  imbalanced man searching for what he wants in life helps extrapolate the  myriad themes present. It shows how all the operations to run the  civilization men built are controlled by women. The basic instinct of man  is useless in this society. Tyler's vision of laying venicen on the streets  of &quot;some abandoned superhighway&quot; show the desire to recreate that  purpose. This does not describe the ingenuity of the themes involved, but  1000 words could hardly come satisfactorily close.      Additionally, I am  not surprised that many of our esteemed film reviewers have brushed this  film off as an ultra-violent, underdeveloped, and weak attempt to explain a  story. This can be partially explained by these reviewers apparent biases.  They are people of another generation, and the ability to grasp ideas  contrary to entrenched ideas is disturbing. Something as new as Fincher's  adaption of Fight Club is too strange to be taken seriously. Also, one  completely intriguing aspect of this film that many dislike is its absence  of complete closure. This is also disturbing to some. I notice that people  often enjoy a movie better when they are dictated what they are supposed to  take from the movies message and what they are supposed to understand  happens. I will not tell you the end of the movie, but it does not wrap a  story ending in a big red bow for the viewers to unwrap and feel content.  It leaves thoughts and ideas to be sorted out and independent conclusions  to be drawn. To do this well is to create art. The Chuck Palahniuk, and the  cast and crew that made Fight Club a movie did this well.
B000005ALP|4.0|This isn't for listening to when you are euphoric, but at any other time it's great to sit back and chill to. Quirky in the extreme, (who else would write songs about their pet monster?) it somehow manages to lift you into  another surreal world while still staying close to your heart. The music  itself verges from the indie rock of 'Novocaine' to the musical commentary  on mordern life that is 'Going over to Susan's House'. Why didn't I give  this 5-stars? Personally I prefer my music a touch lighter in tone, and  it's a little too easy to listen to, with great lyrics and tune drifting by  as you concentrate on something else. However, there are enough brilliant  tracks to keep you getting it out time after time, 'Guest list' is a  favourite that I am never sad without.
B000021XS0|5.0|The best music out there. Hearing this while driving a Ferrari is great...
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD is a shot of real life. Even if it is not his world, he speaks for people who have had some of the same experiences. As for those with no sense of humor well follow the advice at the end of track 8.
B00004TH6O|2.0|Ok, i know that Kyuss is no more, and I don't really even expect Josh and Nick to carry on in that direction. And I did quite like the first QOTSA album. But I just don't understand what all the fuss is about this album.  To me it sounds like lots of half-baked ideas and an overall pretty generic  guitar rock album. I bought an advance promo of this used on the  recommendations of reviews and hype, and sat back waiting to be blown away.  I was not! I've given it a few listens now, and there are 3 or 4 good songs  on it, but nothing memorable that would draw you in again and again. And  i'm sorry &quot;Monsters in Your Parasol&quot; is just a terrible song.  Bummer...
B00004THAY|5.0|If you have been teased by &quot;Riding With The King&quot; (the single released earlier this month by B.B. King and Eric Clapton from their long awaited CD &quot;Riding With The King&quot;), the wait is over and the  title song is only the beginning of a journey that will have you rockin'  and reelin' with the blues.  My two favorite guitar-playin', blues whalin'  stars pulled it off with this one. B.B. is his usual great on the vocals  and Clapton's awesome guitar, as always, will blow you away. These new  tunes are award winners for sure. Check out the samples provided and you'll  be next in line to order your copy! Fasten your seatbelts and en-joy the  ride!
B0000022JS|5.0|This movie is a must for all parents. Watch it alone so not to give the kids ideas.Funny and really true to life.If all kids of divorced parents were twins we would have less divorce. I really loved this movie
B00000JCOV|3.0|You've probably heard their hit single Wait and Bleed and are now thinking of buying this CD. The answer is to be carefull. The rest of the CD is differant from Wait and Bleed, most of the other songs seem to be much more  monatonous than wait and bleed is. Alot of screaming and mumbling, just  like in wait and bleed, but bot mixed in with the singing and change up in  the actuall music. The rest of their song better compare to Static-X then  what your probably expecting.
158234082X|5.0|Anthony Bourdain probably had a great deal of fun writing this book: it is, at different levels, a Catholic confession, an exposé of the restaurant industry, several psychological case studies, a twelve-step self criticism session, a truly picaresque tale, a how-to book, a how-not-to manual, a tract on God and the nature of man, and a book of prayer. <br />I cannot know how competent a chef Mr. Bourdain is, but I do know, from reading his prose, that he is a very fine writer and a humorist of the first order. Yes, he makes you smile through the tears. He makes you laugh while in pain.<br />The reviews that this book has elicited from Amazon readers have been bi-polar, love-hate. Those who don't like the author call him a narcissist and a phony; a drug-addled fool, and an ignoramus. He is called a \\"New Yorker\\" in its pejorative sense; and a traitor. Some say the book is not worth its price. Hah!<br />There is a short chapter (less than ten pages long) called \\"How to Cook Like a Pro\\" which alone justifies the price of the book. Bourdain gives far more than he takes. Tucked away in his chronicle of food adventures are dozens of slivers of profound wisdom, tiny truffle particles of divine knowledge that will enrich the life and the productions of anyone entering the kitchen with creative intents. Good reading. Practical advice. A useful pleasure - therefore a rarity.
B00003CWL5|5.0|Wow, a movie that actually deserved an oscar.  And Wes Bentley is amazing and very hot!
0792833260|5.0|The moment this movie came out it was a classic, filled with humor and emotion plus a great plotline. If you've only seen it once buy the video so you can watch it again and again. Dustin Hoffman is brilliant alongside Tom  Cruise, the only downfall of this movie is that it wasn't longer.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Simply stated, this is Jethro Tull's best album.  Though Aqualung is perhaps more popular and better known, this is the album that shows Tull's potential.  Listening to one song at 45 minutes sounds like it might be  some work.  It took me two or three listens before I got used to the rapid  shifts in mood, but every listen after that has been pure heaven.  Thick as  a Brick is my favorite Tull album, then Aqualung, then This Was.
B00004THAY|5.0|Well, after Pilgrim who was kind of a retrospective of Eric's sadness and joys in the last few year, &quot;God&quot; comes back 2 take a ride with one the most influential blues (among Albert King, Jimi Hendrix or T-Bone  Walker) guitarist ever, BB King. This album is almost a tribute to the  music of BB who influenced Eric a lot. Eric jams with one his masters in a  very relaxed way, kinda like Stevie Ray Vaughan with Albert King on  &quot;In Session&quot;. This is a very cool relaxed blues jam session and  hearing those two play 4 each other is like heaven in your stereo. I think  this is a return to form from those two &quot;human gods&quot; and a trip  back to BB's roots. It's definitely worth getting, and it looks very nice  sittin' right to the King/SRV &quot;In Session&quot; CD. Oh, by the way,  you can hear, Prince's former revolution band members and now independent  artists, Wendy Melvoin &amp; Lisa Coleman singing background voices, just  like on the old Prince albums from the 80s...the result is inexpected but  wonderful.
B000002UV1|5.0|This is without a doubt the bands best 80's album.  Much more focused and consistant than the band's first 3 albums.  It helped the band break through and contained their first true hits, Higher Ground and Knock Me  Down.  This album is one of their best albums and did a great job of  introducing John and Chad.  Without a doubt 5 stars, not a weak moment.
6302256704|5.0|No real plot, no real emotion just scene after scene of hilarious stupid humor, just the way a movie should be made.<br />&quot;Ah! I lost my cap! Swing around and we'll pick it up&quot; &quot;We're on the mission  sir&quot; &quot;Ah, good thinking. Put Rubertawitz down in a life raft to  mark the spot.&quot; &quot;We could be out here for days sir&quot;  &quot;Then put some food on the raft! Do I have to think of everything.  We'll tape all his favorite show, he won't miss anything. Fine, how am I  suppose to be an Admiral without my cap. It's out there all alone, and I'm  here powerless to do anything about it.&quot;
B000002WYT|5.0|crash is the best of all their wonderful albums. you just can't beat #41, tripping billies, lie in our graves ah the list goes on! it just takes me back to college hanging out with my brothers listening to say goodbye at  parties. dave is best when live but in the studio crash cannot be beat!
6301880447|4.0|I wish to thank the two prior reviewers of this recording for confirming its provenance as the Levine set done at the Met for Deutsche Grammophon. I have not purchased the VHS version but the Laserdisc, and that format is  effective too. As I recall, the Liu of this recording (as I recall, Barbara  Hendricks) is the same one as in the Karajan studio recording, and she  acquits herself very well on both of them. The rest of the cast generally  is very fine, and special marks go to the chorus.  The ascent of the moon  in Act I, when yet another unsuccessful suitor meets his dark fate, is very  moving, particularly aided by the stage sets and original costuming.  <br />Domingo as Calaf is self-recommending and he acts the role well too.  I  have some reservations about Eva Marton's performance in the title role -  hence 4 stars instead of 5 - as she has a noticeable beat in her voice, and  in spite of the costuming does not look at all like an irresistable  Princess that men would literally be willing to risk their heads over. It  would be difficult to criticize her acting because the role does not  require much of it. Vocally she is no match for Joan Sutherland in this  role, nothwithstanding the difference between live and studio conditions.  To be fair, she is better here than in the 1983 Turandot done live in  Vienna with Jose Carreras and Maazel conducting, also available on VHS.  Levine conducts very forcefully and revels in Puccini's exotic percussion  and chromaticism. He also handles the Franco Alfano ending as well as  possible. It is a great tragedy that Puccini died from throat cancer before  completing Act III.  The scene of Liu's death is as inspired in its own  right as the Liebestod, and then the chords introducing Calaf's  &quot;Principessa d'iglessa&quot;, where Alfano takes over, hit you like a  diatonic jolt.<br />Overall, this remains a very enjoyable experience and  gives a thrilling idea of experiencing a live performance at the Met.  Highly recommended.
B000002UTH|5.0|This album is definatly an improvement over the first thanks to producer George Clinton,Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons.  It contains classics like Jungle Man, Hollywood, and If you Want Me to Stay. The album gets better  after repeated listens and is recommended to anyone who loves the peppers  early stuff.
B00004THAY|5.0|Clapton fans have been waiting for this one for a long time, but it may not have turned out quite as they expected.  Blues fans will flock to this and be surprised by the almost poppy feel of some of the tracks.<br />The  title track is one such &quot;pop-friendly&quot; tune, and sort of sets the  tone for the strong vocal presence throughout the album.  B.B. is aging  about as gracefully as possible, and his voice and Lucille just seem to get  better and better.  <br />A surprise to many may be the presence of Doyle  Bramhall II, &quot;heir to the Stevie Ray Vaughan&quot; throne.  His father  was SRV's drummer, co-writer, and best friend, and Doyle II is definitely  one of the best up-and-coming guitarists around.  His solo album,  &quot;Jellycream&quot; is *the* best record to come out of the last year,  in my opinion.<br />Two of the tracks from that release have made it onto this  disc - &quot;I Wanna Be&quot; and &quot;Marry You,&quot; both of which  feature infectious grooves and mix R&amp;B with Texas funk.  Add to that  now the presence of B.B. and E.C., and you've got a 74 year-old man singing  things like, &quot;Come on in the back of my '57, let me show you the way  to heaven...&quot;<br />The best way to listen to this disc is to put all  expectations aside and just let these three legends play for you, all of  whom are clearly having a blast playing together, and just listen and have  fun.<br />My favorites from the album are &quot;Three O'Clock Blues,&quot; the  traditional &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; jam, and the classic  &quot;Worried Life Blues.&quot;
6302662648|5.0|I Would Give This Movie 2 Thumbs Up. Dan Akroyd Did A Great Job Playing The Role As &quot;Mother&quot;. The TV Ancherman Ernie Tetrault Used To Work At WRGB Channel 6 , A CBS Affiliate In Schenectady, N.Y. Which Is  Nearby Albany, The Capital Of New York State. He Also Did A Great Job On  The News In The Movie. It Was Also Film Right In The Newsroom At WRGB. You  Would Like This Movie.
B0000399WI|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies. It is a great movie of hope and prison life. It is about a man the is sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn't commit. He goes to prison and meets friends and wants to  make them happy, so he gives the warden some financial tips, if he can give  his &quot;Co-Workers&quot; some beer. He says yea and soon he is the  prisons banker. He does everything for them but is really just planning  revenge. I highly reccomend this great movie. You will want watch it over  and over again, even though it is over 2 hours long.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album is without a doubt the best album of 1999.  Although not their best album, it's definately worth hearing.  It contains essential songs like the title track, otherside and scar tissue.  If you don't already own  this, get it now.  What are you waiting for, get it!
0440234743|5.0|Although this is only my 2nd Grisham novel that I have actually read (I love movies... and they are quicker) it was incredibly good. His way of describing landscapes and different people is awe striking. This book was  very good, although it had it's dull spots where you simply wished you  could skim it over, the exciting parts were worth the wait.<br />Also, the  jumping back and forth between the court room and with Nate in Brazil kept  my attention (I admit it, I have a rather short attention span) I would  reccomend it for anyone-- don't worry about not understanding something,  for once again, Grisham is a miracle worker at describing difficult things.
068815333X|4.0|As a huge fan of Ed McBain, Michael Connolley, James Patterson, Nelson DeMille--I don't know how I've missed Dennis Lehane's books. &quot;Rain&quot; was gripping, suspenseful, entertaining--if a bit graphic  in places--and Lehane truly holds his own with some of the better-known  authors of his genre. I just finished the last page of &quot;Rain&quot; and  came straight to Amazon to buy some of his other titles! I want to read  more of these characters' lives--their stories are as compelling as the  cases they're investigating (reminiscent of McBain's 87th P cops). If you  like suspense, detective procedurals and intelligent, thought-provoking  plots, this is a great page turner.
0671042858|2.0|When you pick up the book and read the first page, it looks like a pretty good book. You keep reading and like it, it builds up to an ending,suspense,suspense,suspense, stupidity.<br />It is the worst ending  Stephen King has ever written. It seems a good book about a girl lost in  the woods, with something after her, it gets you excited about the ending,  then disappoints you. I don't reccomend it at all, just skip it.
B000002BFZ|5.0|I have to admit i was very dissapointed the first time i bought this album.  i was expecting another vs or ten but this album was something i never expected.  i hate the people that say its their worst album.  they  all just expect them to do ten all over again.   this is just their  experimental album.   this album is very underatted.  the album before this  sold 5 million, this album only sold a million, so this album made their  audience shrink.  i think this is one of their better albums.  from the  opening track sometimes to the excellent who you are and off he goes, every  track on here is awesome.  for those of you who gave this album one star.   you need to stop living in the past and give new things a chance instead of  listening to them once and hating them.  this album takes a few listens to  grow on you.
B0000020C4|2.0|I have to say it is my opinion that the TAC is highly overrated in general.  Colm Wilkinson and Philip Quast are both excellent I admit but couldn't the producers have gotten some people we hadn't heard of before  instead of them repeating their performances? I also admit I like Ruthie  Henshall as Fantine but there is something not quite right about her  performance I can't put my finger on, perhaps she is a little OTT. I also  like Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway as the Thenardiers but again Alun  was also on the OLR and I prefer the people on the CSR. I don't like  Michael Magiure as Enjolras - he is far too nasal and high pitched and his  accent really annoys me after a while. Anthony Warlowe on the CSR is, in my  opinion, much better and more convincing. I also admit that Michael Ball is  the Marius but he is really pushing his luck passing himself off as a 20  year old.  Lea Salonga is the performer who annoys me most. It's not that  she can't sing or act (her performance in Miss Saigon proved that) but I  think she's totally miscast as Eponine and there is too much of her  performance as Kim in her performance as Eponine. Frances Ruffelle and Kaho  Shimada are, in my opinion, much better and are much more accurate in their  portryals of Eponine. I find Leas 'On My Own' harsh and more shouted than  sung and her 'A little fall of rain' overracted. Incidentally, I hear  Frances was the producers first choice and Lea was only selected when  Frances backed out due to family obligations. Judy Kuhn is not terribly  convincing as 16 year old Cosette and I much prefer Rebecca Caine in the  OLR who, in my opinion, has a much better voice and was better cast. In  general, I found the entire concert too commercial and run-of-the mill.
B00003Q438|2.0|First things first: this review is entirely about that quality of the DVD edition and NOT about the movie itself. I was extremly disappointed with the image quality of this DVD. Comparing it with the special edition  laserdisc, I am absolutely sure that the same transfer was used to save  cost. Althought it says on the box &quot;enhanced for widescreen TVs&quot;,  which means anamorphic, the transfer is actually non-anamorphic letterbox,  and a poor one at that. The letterbox transfer only uses about one third of  the lines of your TV (and as we all know, these aren't a hell of a lot of  lines to start with) and to make matters worse, this one seriously lacks  sharpness and detail. There is some color noise to be seen as well. As far  as I am concerned, they can keep all their bonus features if they don't get  the most important thing right: a crisp image transfer that fully utilizes  the capabilities of the DVD medium. Apart from that it has to be said that  the DD 5.1 sound is top-class, couldn't be better. Some serious workouts  for all six speakers, good dialogue sound and lots of directional effects.  Perfect. But so was the AC-3 track on the laserdisc...
B00002MZ2C|2.0|They have a few good ones on this CD, but they all more or less sound the same. You will probably get bored of it after a while and not listen to it again. I would say don't buy it, but maybe get a single of guerrilla radio  or something. That was the best song on it.
B000002MTR|5.0|This and BSSM are the band's best albums.  Although it didn't sell nearly as much as the new one or BSSM, its arguably stronger than Californication.  Its rocks alot harder and is has more funk.  It contains essential items  like Warped, My Friends, Coffee Shop and Aeroplane.  It has the funky  Walkabout and the rockin Shallow be Thy Game.  There isn't a weak moment on  the album.  It is without a doubt, one of the best albums ever made.
B000002C1V|5.0|This is an excellent cd.  There is an incredible amount of emotion in each song.  Some of my favorites are:  your possible pasts, paranoid eyes, not now john, hero's return, gunner's dream, fletcher memorial home, etc.  I  don't know why a lot of floyd fans don't like this album? perhaps its  because there's no &quot;comfortably numb&quot; or &quot;money&quot; on  here.  This is an album that separates true floyd fans from the posers.   The lyrics and music are great so pick this one up already.
B00003CXAR|5.0|For once, I find myself agreeing with Leonard Maltin's short take - Jaws as a novel was a bubble gum read. Jaws as a movie is a terriffic thrill ride.<br />Problems with the mechanical shark (named &quot;Bruce&quot;) led  Spielburg and his editors to cut the film so that the shark is rarely seen  on camera except for an ominious fin slicing through the water. This builds  up the suspense and terror, and is the main reason that Jaws was the  success that it was. If you doubt that, go to your local library and look  up the back issues of your local paper or Time magazine. They'll tell you  the story of how the success of the film kept people out of the water at  the beaches that year (which had towns that run beaches hopping mad because  no one was coming to their beaches and they were going broke).<br />The  strength of the three leads is also one of the pillars of this film.  Scheider, Dreyfuss and the late Robert Shaw are all extremely believable in  their roles. And Scheider gets to deliver an actor's dream; a simple  one-liner that will rank in history as being forever identified with that  actor and film: &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot;
B000000H7I|5.0|Trust me, there isn't a more brutal, technical, heavy, crushing Death Metal Band on the whole Planet! It's really a pity that they don't exist anymore. If you think that Morbid Angel, Obituary or even Deicide are  brutal then check this out!  Highly Recommanded!
B000002UWW|5.0|this is one of the best rhcp albums. it is a excellent hits album.  its got all their best old songs from true men dont kill coyotes all the way up to under the bridge which somehow found its way on this album.  i dont know  why though, it sounds out of place.  anyway, although this omits a few  great tracks, it nevertheless does a excellent job of sorting through rhcps  first fours albums and does all the people who are too lazy to buy the  first four albums a favor.
B000001Y79|5.0|Even if you don't like the popular band, &quot;No Doubt&quot; you will fall in love with this CD from the first time you listen to it.  It has such a variety of songs recorded on it.  From slow to fast you can find  your next favorite song by listening to Tragic Kingdom.  If you have  listened to other No Doubt CD's you'll probably realize that they like to  write songs that mean something to them.  Tragic Kingdom is like one big  story and you can relate a lot of the songs to your own life.  I would  recommend Tragic Kingdom over any other of No Doubt's CD's and get it  NOW!
B00004U2A1|4.0|Ok, first off this is not actually a sequel to the first movie. It is more of a remake with a new twist, but nonetheless it is a great movie. Raimi and Co. could not get the stock footage from the first Evil Dead, so they  decided to re-shoot the movie as a remake of sorts. I would say that ED2 is  more of a black comedy than a horror movie, but it still carries enough  scares to be good. The character of Ash comes into his own in this movie.  It is a great movie alone or to be watched after viewing Evil Dead, but be  prepared. If you are view both of them for the first time, it can be a tad  confusing, but all in all I would recommend these movies to anyone.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is definetly the two Kings of the Blues. They are the best Blues artists around today. I will purchase this CD without even hearing any more than the sample and will be sure that it will be great. B.B. and Eric  together how could you go wrong.
B000002JSP|5.0|this was another great album.  its highlights include in the evening all my love fool in the rain south bound saurez and whatever the title of the fifth track was.  the ten minute one.  the only thing wrong with the cd is  that is doesent have the origanl bag that came with the cd.  swan song  should reissue it again with a cardboard cover over the origanal cd case  like on everclear so much for the afterglow or on marilyn manson antichrist  superstar and mechanical animals. the cardboard covering should have the  paperbag cover and when you take that off you can see the cover they have  when you see it in stores.
B00004THAY|5.0|Top flight--two stellar artists together. Shouldn't pass this one up
6304994540|5.0|This movie is hilarious!  John Goodman is a clueless nutcase.  Every time I thought he was finally going to get it right, he screws up.  Jeff Bridges lackadaisical attitude toward everything, even when he's worried about the  kidnapping, is amusing.    I was laughing incredibly hard most of the way  through it.  Easily one of the Coen brothers' best.
0440219078|5.0|This book is amazing.  It has the most intriguing plot of most any book i have ever read.  It deals with a young boy who lives in the &quot;perfect world&quot;--no sickness, pain, hunger, divorce, or any of the troubles in our world.  But when it is time for his job to be chosen Jonas is selected  to be his community's(more like an isolated city) Reciever of Memories.   Suddenly the horrible truth is revealed to Jonas- the truth of his utopia  type world.  This is his revelations about the world before this, and his  reactions and decisions because of this.  It is a book that I read every  year, as I have for the past 7, because of its wonderful plot, and  captivating ideas.  A must have.
B00004THAY|5.0|In this CD BB King and Eric Clapton both stretch their potential to the maximum to create one of the best blues cd's I have ever heard.  This CD is essential for any blues enthusiast.  It is modern while retro sounding at  the same time and is overall a great listening experience.  You have to  have this one.
B00004T9UF|5.0|... <br />  The man has ten  times the skill of most of the moet drinkin ladies men and pretend thugs  out there. With songs like &quot;Kill You&quot; which is a warning to all  the rappers, critics and his mom, he shows that he is lyrically spectacular  (I invented violence you vile venomous volitile vicious vain Vicadin ving  ving ving)while letting you know that he is raw as hell.  My personel  favorites on the album are 'B. Please' with Xzibit, Snoop and Dre, 'Stan'  an excellent story about an obsessive fan and 'Marshall Mathers' in which  Eminem wonders aloud why &quot;Everybody wants to run their mouths and try  to take shots at me&quot;.  Dr. Dre's production is as tight as usual and  Eminem shows some diversity as he produces some of his own tracks as well.   His guest rappers D12 suffer from trying to be a little too much like him  but they also have skills.  Overall a ridiculous album.  BUY IT NOW!lic Service Annoucement). Bottom line, get this CD.   It's for new and old Eminem fans alike.  It's funny, phat, has great  lyrics, tells the truth about music today, and of course tells the tales of  a man named Marshall Mathers. It flows 99% of the time, and only leaves  listeners left short on tracks like &quot;Remember Me?&quot; and  &quot;Amityville&quot;.  (Opinion of course)... I can't tell you which  tracks you'll like and which you wont but bottom line (like stated before)  is: For the real fans who have been following Em's work for awhile now, and  also for the fans who have just recently caught onto this young man's  fabulous work and his great addition to the rap/hip-hop world who will  probably only buy the CD for &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; will like it  as well.  If that's good or bad, I don't know, but either way everybody is  going to have a good LP in their hands after paying their 15 bucks.   So  put one finger on each hand up and be proud to be out of your mind and out  of control and one more time play the whole CD through. (Oh yeah...Ifyou  don't like my opinion then refer to the song &quot;Under The Influence)   Thanks..
6300213803|5.0|Zowie!  What the Star Wars films did with grand, whole-fleet battles, this movie does with ship-vs-ship, one-on-one space action.  But it's more than that.  The characters are richly developed, Ricardo Montalban makes one of the best-ever movie villains, and the cliffhanger ending tugs right at your heart.
0767824571|5.0|This has to be the funniest movie ever made.  At some points you are completely lost as to the reason of a scene, but still find it strangely funny.  The movie follows the adventures of King Arthur and some of his  knights on their seperate journeys to find the Holy Grail.. Each encounter  dangerous adversaries(?), such as beautiful 18 year old &quot;nuns&quot;,  and a rather foppish boy who needs rescuing from a unwanted marriage.   There is really no describing it, other than absolutely hilarious.  I  recommend it for anyone seeking unending laughs.  Even the beginning  credits make you cry with laughter.  A must have.
B000002U82|5.0|Anyone who decides to start listening to Floyd should start with this album.  It's not the most straight forward Floyd offering, but it has all of the elements they were good at.  There is just the right mix of guitar  powered numbers and lyrical masterpieces.  This is an ALBUM, and is best  enjoyed when listened to beginning to end.  After this album try 'The Wall'  or 'Wish You Were Here'.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|The Svage Garden CD Affirmation is tight! The songs really show how Darrens feelings are about things, which i can realate to!  It is the best CD I think they ever made. It deseves 5 stars really alot more stars  than that! SAVAGE GARDEN KEEP YOU HEADS UP U GUYS ARE GREAT!
0375804013|5.0|This is a great book.  My dad was reading it to me for as long as I can rembember. I'm 15 now and when i feel like reading I'll pick up this book because it is still enjoyable.
6305823839|4.0|This is not the first one but one of the best film on the drugs addicts. It shows the real life with a sort of second degree which give interrest to the story. Of course some scene are a little bit...disgusting, in this  movie you'll see 'the worst toilets in scotland' for example... Try this  film, it is a gret moment and the B.O. is  just excellent! <br />Just an  advice : avoid watching this film while you are eating...
B00000AD94|5.0|I don't get how people can hate this disc. It gets silly at times, yes, and Morse's songwriting can meander a bit, but that is what makes prog fun. You really never know what is next on the disc. Some people just want to go  back to the 70's and hear nothing but Yes and Genesis. That isn't going to  happen. New bands like Spock's Beard are taking over, and I don't mind one  bit :-)
B000002P6R|4.0|There was a sense of sacrilege amongst many fans when this came out, but Face Dances should be viewed as the work of a different band than the Keith Moon line up.  The sound, the feel and the focus were a surprise to many at  the time, possibly including the band themselves.  This was a band that  could have aged well, but unfortunately slipped off the bus into a  nostalgia trip.  The remastered CD sounds different, not better, and  weakens the bottom end from the original vinyl recording.  The bonus tracks  are snoozers.
B00002Z88D|4.0|Just as in my title this not one of their best CD's and only one of the two I don't give five stars to(Kill Em'All). The reason is I already own most of the songs except for two new tracks Minus Human and the hit No Leaf  Clover. Another reason is some of the songs sound distorted due to symphony  and Metallica is not playing as hard as they can. Without the symphony the  CD would have been much better but what are ya gonna do. Just a nice  experimentation. The song that sounds real good with symphony is Nothing  Else Matters. Other than that the CD is very good and I recommend this  album but don't make this your first Metallica buy. Buy the black album or  Master of Puppets and all the others before you buy this album.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is a typical Iron Maiden album! The changes in tempo fingerprint their Maiden's unique distinction from other bands like Labrynth. The song &quot;Brave New World&quot; is a good example of this style.  Some other  bands try to follow their step but most of them failed miserably.<br />The  song &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot; is probably my favorite song in the  album. There are so many tempo changes in there that really make my mood  swings every time I listen to it. The more you listen to it, the more you  realize how talented the group is in terms of knitting all the melodies  into one song.<br />They + Dickinson are 'brave' enough to come back and I  therefore have to give them two thumbs up!
B000021XR5|5.0|I didn't think it would be this great.  STP to me have always been good, but not great.  However, this one blew me away.  Obvious Doors influence in some tracks, and they sound great.  Very, vey good.  Buy it now.

0671004107|5.0|This is an excellent book, both because it is so imaginative and so concrete. Carl Sagan's excellent science knowledge make the ideas plausible in a sci-fi kind of way. Where the book leaps up and excels is that it is  so eerily close to what I could imagine happening in the real world, the  government official are real, the talks, the deliberations, the project,  and the reactions of people. If aliens contacted us tomorrow, this book  would be the blueprint, there would be groups for it, groups against it,  and groups willing to go to any length to thwart the meeting. If you have  seen the movie, compare the end of the book to that of the movie, see who  gets in the last &quot;blow&quot; science or religion. It is interesting to  see how they differ. This is one of the most excellent books I have read.
068485743X|3.0|This book: creates a powerful image of overworked publishers being inundated with manuscripts suffering from similar faults; documents those faults; and gives general pointers on how to get published.<br />Three (basic)  exercise-packed sections cover:<br />* Preliminary problems-- presentation,  adjectives &amp; adverbs, sound, comparison, and style.<br />* Dialogue--  between the lines, commonplace, informative, melodramatic, and hard to  follow.<br />* The bigger picture-- showing versus telling, viewpoint and  narration, characterization, hooks, subtlety, tone, focus, setting, and  pacing &amp; progression.<br />The book could be improved through: addition on  an overview of the publishing market and publishers (statistics for  different genres &amp; countries); use of fewer words for content; better  use of sidebars &amp; summaries to be able to \\"use\\" book more effectively;  explicitly wider focus beyond fiction &amp; novels; and discussion of  \\"content\\"- the value add for the reader. <br />Overall a worthwhile read, but  consider \\"Writing a Novel - and getting published\\" (Teach Yourself) by  Nigel Watts first- it covers similar content concisely, plus adds much more  in an easier to read format.
1567184855|5.0|I bought this book and read it on my vacation on the Big Island of Hawaii.  I rented a condo (the Kona Reef) which sits right next to the waves coming in, hunkered down on the Lanai, and read this book with unending intensity.   All I can say is, WHOW!  What a book!<br />Now I know why the color purple is  rare and why, in some other books I have read, that healing goes on by  advanced beings using purple light! <br />This book is an absolute MUST READ  for anyone who wants to know about what happens in the Afterlife. I sat  there for hours ensconced in the quality of the dialog of the different  cases, trying to self-relate to where I might be on the spiritual level of  evolution.  This is a monumental contribution to Spirituality, excellent  read, to-the-point, extremely well organized.  I was able to follow the  entire book systematically in reasoning and logic.  I found myself filling  in big gaps in my understanding of what I thought the evolution of the soul  was all about.  From time to time I read passages that were confirmatory  with many other details which I have gleened through many many books on  NDE's, death, spiritual soul development, reincarnation and so forth.  <br />I  am a little hesitant though in thinking that Karma is as important a facet  of spiritual law as what it has been made out to be.  That is, for every  action there is an equal and opposite reaction on a spiritual level?    Michael points out that the soul does NOT have to reincarnate, although it  is highly encouraged, as this speeds the development of the soul.<br />I am a  little disturbed to think that we are all on some kind of schedule for  which our spiritual &quot;betters&quot; have us hustling along, even if we  are reticent to come back here and undergo the fire of pain and pleasure.   It appears in Mike's book, that souls are continuously created, which is  what I thought for a long time until I read some contradictory things which  said that God made all of our souls at once, so we are all of equal  age.<br />In context of God's Absolute Self, time does not exist, and so of  course it would appear that all of us were created simultaneously in the  ever present NOW.  Yet, from my relativistic standpoint, there is the NOW  that was, the NOW that is and the NOW that will be.  If we all were created  simultaneously, we all SHOULD be moving along the scheduled path  approximately the same...though Mike says that each of us is developing at  our own rate.  What I found most alluring was the idea that because we are  individually developing at different rates, as we advance as individuals,  we CAN leave the Group Self.  <br />I am hoping (though I doubt it), that I am  not a beginner soul....as 70,000 to 120,000 years seems to be a long LONG  time to get somewhere.  Heck, they were bagging bronto's back then!  &lt;chuckle&gt;<br />What Mike didn't cover was the fact that we can incarnate  into the PAST!  It appears in his book that we are all incarnating relative  to progressive earth time as if the NOW of now and the future tie us to our  incarnations...i.e., if we wanted to be born in Ancient Egypt, could we?   Even though I just lead a 20th century life?   Some sources I have read  say YES...but it would be good if Mike could confirm this one for us.<br />I  am effusive about this work to the highest degree, it is INVALUABLE!   Anyone who wants to know about what to expect, or at least get an idea of  where they have come from, needs desperately to read this book!<br />Mike, you  get 6 Stars from me, A+++ or whatever, because this is one heck of a book!
038542471X|4.0|This book was well written, Grisham creating a wonderful page turner full of suspense and mystery.  But the book got boring at parts, for instance, the scenario when the lawyers gathered seemed rather dry.  But the fact  that I read this at 12 may add to that emotion.  I suppose that it was  necessary, and it is rather hard to make lawyers seem interesting. (I  should know, my dad is probably the most boring person to grace this  planet.  And he just happens to be a lawyer.  Coincidence? I think not!)   Anyway, I recommend this book to anyone, but be prepared for some heavy  reading.
B00004THAY|5.0|this album is great. you should check it out.
B00004THAY|5.0|Well, after Pilgrim who was kind of a retrospective of Eric's sadness and joys in the last few year, &quot;God&quot; comes back 2 take a ride with one the most influential blues (among Albert King, Jimi Hendrix or T-Bone  Walker) guitarist ever, BB King. This album is almost a tribute to the  music of BB who influenced Eric a lot. Eric jams with one his masters in a  very relaxed way, kinda like Stevie Ray Vaughan with Albert King on  &quot;In Session&quot;. This is a very cool relaxed blues jam session and  hearing those two play 4 each other is like heaven in your stereo. I think  this is a return to form from those two &quot;human gods&quot; and a trip  back to BB's roots. It's definitely worth getting, and it looks very nice  sittin' right to the King/SRV &quot;In Session&quot; CD. Oh, by the way,  you can hear, Prince's former revolution band members and now independent  artists, Wendy Melvoin &amp; Lisa Coleman singing background voices, just  like on the old Prince albums from the 80s...the result is inexpected but  wonderful.
B000023X9W|2.0|As a long-time (25 years) fan of Neil Young, I must say that he should follow his own advise. After listening to this CD a few times, I thought I was going to need CPR to revive me. This collection is as mellow as Harvest  Moon, but fortunately not as melancholy. On a Neil Young scale of 1-10 this  is a 1 or 2. But compared with most music being released these days, it is  still a 9 or 10. Somebody please wake me for his next release.
6302424739|5.0|Well...this is by far one of my favorite all time movies!   If you loved Crossing Delancey w/ Amy Irving &amp; Peter Riegert, you'll love this movie (and vice versa).  Also, books by Rosamunde Pilcher.  All of these share a  common bond, rich character development.  You feel as though you KNOW these  people, you can picture them &amp; see them clearly in your mind, and it's  easy to get completely lost in the stories. You cry with them, laugh with  them, and love them (or hate them!).   But, love them or hate them, you  would enjoy meeting them &amp; spending time with them!  Because they are  INTERESTING!
B000002GYI|5.0|I'd been a fan of the original Krautrockers Kraftwerk, circa &quot;Kraftwerk,&quot; &quot;Kraftwerk 2&quot; and &quot;Ralf und Florian.&quot;  They were definitely part of a growing movement of  like-minded musicians, and I loved the direction they were taking  music.<br />Then &quot;Autobahn&quot; came out, and later &quot;Computer  World.&quot;  What the hell?  This wasn't Krautrock.  It was something...  different.  Something vaguely commercial, but still with Kraftwerkian  accents.  At the time I dismissed these albums as attempts to sell out, at  the cost of all the innovation they had built up, and of course doomed to  failure.<br />Shows what I knew.  They have since become classics, the first  salvos in a new style of music which has taken over the world.
B000002AH7|5.0|I have been listening to this masterpiece for thirty years and I have never grown tired of it. It is unique. It is timeless. It's impossibly beautiful. <br />Miles said that he put so much into recording this album that it left him absolutely drained. It can do that to the listener, too! <br />I love &quot;Kilimanjaro&quot;, &quot;Bitches&quot;, &quot;Fillmore&quot;, &quot;Live-Evil&quot;, &quot;On The Corner&quot;, &quot;Pangaea&quot; and other albums from much later than this that are worlds away from it in style, but this will always be 'up there'. By the way, this is the same remastered material, bonus tracks included, that appears on &quot;The Complete ...Miles / Evans&quot;<br />Buy this and listen to 'Solea' again and again and behold the power of music!
B000007U6W|4.0|I'd been a fan of the original Krautrockers Kraftwerk, circa &quot;Kraftwerk,&quot; &quot;Kraftwerk 2&quot; and &quot;Ralf und Florian.&quot;  They were definitely part of a growing movement of  like-minded musicians, and I loved the direction they were taking  music.<br />Then &quot;Autobahn&quot; came out, and later &quot;Computer  World.&quot;  What the hell?

B000005J56|5.0|The entire CD is wonderful and very moving.  I have shared it with friends and everyone has had the same reaction. We've shared the CD with each other and it is very exciting at any time of the day or night.  The booklet that  is enclosed is especially helpful to sing along.  I want to hear more!
B00004SCX6|5.0|I thought her 1st album was better but this one was still really good.  I would recommened it to anyone who likes the song Oops!...I did it Again because it's mostly all up-beat and kinda techno!
B000002A3T|5.0|It's not the Floyd that you're used to, but it's still quite good. It's quite a bit better than Momentary Lapse of Reason. Some think that it has a deeper meaning as well, I'm refering to the publius enigma. Look it up,  it's sort of interesting. In any case I wpuld recomend this to any true  Pink Floyd fan.
B00004T37H|5.0|I'm not an afficianado of Japanese animation, but Princess Mononoke caught my attention and my imagination despite that.  Beautiful animation and a skillful English adaptation by Neil Gaiman bring alive a captivating tale  of epic proportions.  Though some of the voices for the English version  were ill-inspired, actresses Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson  particularly bring their characters to life.  All in all, the film is  stunning and breathtaking.
6305903182|5.0|this movie takes up for scream2 I mean when I saw it it was awsome. And this is a very excellent movie because the plot adds up to the first one this is going to be a horror classic. The hole story adds up to this and if  wes if you read this no offence but you would be nuts not to make a scream  4. And this movie is little comedy because of parker posey. this is a total  shocker at the end dont worry i wont spoil it. And the plot is mind taking.  But it is very sad at the begining. And this movie is well worth the wait  big time. great work wes
B00004THAY|5.0|Ok, I'm a tad biased as I'm a huge Clapton fan (heck, he's still &quot;god&quot; in my book).  The disc shows how to giants in the guitar world can show restraint and taste by sharing guitar and vocals. Clapton's  tone is so sweet, pure strat and BB, well, he's the best at those short,  jabs and staccoto licks.  The playing is never over the top, which is a  good thing, but adding the true bite or smooth emotion each song deserves.  This album combines old blues gems like &quot;Ten Long Years&quot; &amp;  &quot;When My Heart Beats Like a Hammer&quot;, with Derek and the Dominoes  &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; (done acoustic, a real treat) along with a  few contemporary R&amp;B covers penned by Doyle Bramhill II &quot;Marry  You&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be&quot; (Doyle also plays rhythm guitar on  this disc...he's gotta be smiling !).  <br />Texas blues great Jimmie Vaughan  adds a few biting solos to &quot;Help the Poor&quot;.  The backing band is  also very tight and some of the finest around...Andy F. Low (guitars, EC's  sideman) Nathan East (bass), Steve Gadd (drums), Joe Sample (piano) and Tim  Carmon (B3 Organ.<br />The overall feel of this is &quot;good time&quot;  blues, bouncing rhythms and the two blues guitar masters having fun.  It's  not the heavy sound of EC's &quot;From the Cradle&quot;, but more like BB's  &quot;Blues on the Bayou&quot;.  <br />A great cd that will no doubt win a  Grammy and delight millions of blues fans (not to mention guitar players,  like me).<br />Super summer driving tunes like the title track or &quot;Marry  You&quot; will have their melodies locked into you head for days.
B00001OH7X|4.0|My first impression of \\"Lodger\\" was that it was a journeyman effort.  With time, however, I have come to appreciate it much more.  It remains  inconsistent, and contains odd barriers, but its heart is strong.<br />The  barriers are the first several elements encountered with the disk, starting  with the unattractive cover.  The cover, of course, has nothing to do with  the music (neither does the name --there is no song called \\"Lodger\\"), but  it sets the wrong mood.  So does the first song, \\"Fantastic Voyage.\\"   Actually, the first several songs are mediocre.  If the other albums of the  \\"Berlin Trilogy,\\" \\"Low\\" and \\"'Heroes'\\" have stronger first halves,  \\"Lodger,\\" has a much stronger second half.<br />The album picks up with \\"D.J.\\"   \\"D.J.\\" is one of Bowie's most megalomaniacal hits, and is far more  enduring than other frequently heard songs like \\"Golden Years\\" and \\"Let's  Dance.\\"  \\"D.J.\\" manages to meld the avant-garde with a popular dance beat  and very edgy lyrics.  <br />\\"D.J.\\" gives way to one of my favorite Bowie  songs,   \\"Look Back in Anger.\\"  \\"Look Back\\" is musically upbeat but  lyrically foreboding. I'm not exactly sure what the song is about, but it  seems menacing.  Oblique Bowie is usually Bowie at his best.  The next song  is \\"Boys Keep Swinging,\\" which is fun and also clever.  The song's  cleverness is that it may not be as straightforward as it seems at first.   The title suggests a return to Bowie's earlier homo-erotic toying, but the  words don't necessarily convey any such meaning.   Instead, the song seems  to be an over-the-top joke about life as a male.  The humor value would be  greater still if Bowie's serious!  I can't hear the song without thinking  also of Bowie's groundbreaking video for it, in which he convincingly  portrays his own (female) backup singers.<br />\\"Repetition\\" is a setback that  comes across as preachy.  The music is not strong and, while its theme  against wife beating is noble, it is also totally unsubtle.  But \\"Lodger\\"recovers with its original closing song, \\"Red Money.\\"  \\"Red Money\\" can best  be appreciated after listening to Iggy Pop's \\"Sister Midnight,\\" which uses  the identical music and some of the same words.  This is the first and  probably best of many Bowie covers of Iggy songs.  I'm not sure either what  the song is about or what the point is about the different lyrics, but it  works.<br />\\"Lodger\\" is possibly the only album re-issued by Rykodisk with  \\"bonus tracks\\" that work at the end of the album.  The second version of  \\"Look Back\\" is not necessary, but at nearly twice the length of the  original it is noticeably different.  \\"I Pray, Ole\\" is a worthy addition to  the album.  Unlike many Bowie albums, the last song on \\"Lodger\\" is not  clearly a \\"closer,\\" so the extra songs fit reasonably well.  But they  aren't that important, so the current EMI reissue will suffice. <br />By the  end of the album, the first half doesn't seem so bad.  Mediocre Bowie is  better than most other music, and mediocre Bowie at this stage of his  career is better yet. \\"Lodger\\" doesn't make it into the top echelon, but it  comes close.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney did a phenomenal job with this one folks, it is truely awesome. There aren't as many sappy ballads, and the ones that are there are awesome. My favorite fast songs are Oops (of course), Stronger, What U See  (is What U get), and Can't make U love me. My favorite slow songs are  Lucky, Don't Let Me be the last to know, Where are you now (great vocals  here). 5 stars all the way! Britney rules.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I bought this CD what seems to be a million years ago.  If it was an LP, I would have worn the grooves smooth.  It is omnipresent, like a juggernaut crushing everything in its path.  I can't get away from the songs here -  they are in commercials on TV, movie previews, on the radio, and in my  dreams.  Who would think mixing down home gospel and elecronica would go  together as well as chocolate and peanut butter.  I know some purists can't  stand this album and some mainstreamers don't get it.  Fine.  For something  to be worthy it doesn't have to be universally loved, just talked about.  I  think this album will have legs, and people will be listening carefully for  years to come.
B00004THAY|5.0|This collaboration between two major guitar players lives up to all the hype.  Clapton's  style is recognizable within two seconds on the title song, and BB's voice is as rich and powerful as ever.  All songs are  delightful.  You gotta have this!
B000002TQV|5.0|This is one of the best CD's of the nineties.  Who would have thought that Radiohead would have topped even this great piece of music with OK  Computer.  It makes me very hopeful for the new Radiohead release later  this year. SO on to the review.  This collection of fine songs (not a loser  in the bunch) will knock your socks off and make you wish you bought it  five years ago.  Every song is nuanced and yet bold and anthemic (sounds  like a wine review)  For example The Bends is bombastic and punchy, yet  melodic and very catchy.  Of course High and Dry and Fake Plastic Trees are  instant classics, but Just has probably one of my favorite lyrics of all  time: &quot;you do it to yourself you do and that's what really hurts&quot;   Damn that's clever - I wish I wrote it!
0767903854|1.0|I'm sorry, as an American living in Australia right now, I have to dissent from the other reviewers here and point out what a lazy, disappointing book this is. Bryson does an excellent job of reading about Australia, and keeps  showing us scenes of himself reading, but he doesn't actually get off his  duff much and do any real reporting himself. He tries to cover an enormous  country in quick trips between or around other things--such as book  touring--and as a result rarely penetrates the surface, and develops no  narrative at all. How can you write intelligently about Uluru/Ayers Rock  after a visit of only two hours (and none at all to the nearby and equally  spectacular Olgas)? How can you write about Aborigines when you never  bother to actually speak to one? It's not as if any of this is hard:  Australians, including Aborigines, are among the most approachable, and  quoteable, people on earth. Instead, we keep hearing about Bryson: what he  pays for motel rooms, what witty remarks he makes to his mate, what he's  read. I'm afraid the once-engaging Bryson has gotten too big and dull for  his britches.
B00004STPT|5.0|From the quieter compositions to the bold battle tracks to the emotionally haunting vocals by Lisa Gerrard, this soundtrack runs the gamut of emotions. If you like music in the style of Holst and Wagner (and don't  mind the &quot;borrowed&quot; renditions here), you will enjoy this music.  The Lisa Gerrard vocals reminded me of some of Loreena McKennitt's  &quot;Moroccan&quot; sound. This CD wonderfully evokes the power and  emotion of the movie - it's difficult to put down once you've starting  playing it. This will go down as one of my favorite soundtracks.
0790729725|5.0|If my title seems like hyperbole, you obviously haven't seen this movie.  With all due respects to Mr. Coppola, &quot;Goodfelleas&quot; blows away even &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up in  the same neighborhoods as the characters in his film, captures onscreen the  most creditble crime story ever told.  Unfolding over the course of three  decades, the movie tells the story of Henry Hill, a mid-level mobster who  only turned state's evidence against his fellows after he had no other  choice.  The movie is bursting with memorable characters; Joe Pesci as the  hotheaded mobster, Robert DiNiro as the cold blooded killer-thief, Paul  Sorvino as the head of the family.  If these guys don't put a chill through  you, nothing will.  This is the best movie from one of America's greatest  directors.
B000002H2H|4.0|Well contrary to many of the reviews here, i dont think this is there BEST though i certanlty do love this album. Kill Em' All is definetly there best album, one of the best speed/trash metal albums of all time. when Black  came out, metallica died, now they are Alternica. MTV Killed METALLICA! .  anyways, this album is very good too. Fade to black has nice guitar work.  my Fav song on it is either Ride The Lightning or Creeping death, though  all of the songs are great
6305180857|3.0|Great suspenfull movie.... Gene Hackman and Danny Glover are great together in this movie that makes men as one..,. They go beyond race, religion, and creed to be as one and rescue someone.
B000002U82|5.0|I once walked into a record store a few months ago, planning on buying The Wall. To my dissapointment, they didn't carry the wall but they had another famous Floyd CD, Dark Side of the Moon. At the time, I wasn't a huge Pink  Floyd fan, but I took a gamble and bought it anyway. And WOWSERS!-I was  absolutely amazed at this album. The first thing that caught my ear was the  really nifty intro &quot;Speak to Me&quot;. Then &quot;Breathe started up  and I really dug the psychedelic music. And then the vocals started up and  I was blown away. It's very hard to describe the feeling and emotion of the  vocals. Gilmour and Waters make an indestructible team. &quot;Time&quot; is  one of the best Floyd songs and &quot;Money&quot; is extremely catchy and  listenable to about anyone. &quot;Us and them&quot; is a beautiful mellow  tuneand the closing medley &quot;Brain Damage/Eclipse&quot; wrap up human  nature in a nice 5 minute song. Eclipse is an amazing song with so much  feeling in it, the whole disc is worth it for that song. I usually never  classify cd's as 5 stars, but Dark Side deserves 20. I now own the Wall,  Wish You Were Here, Animals, Piper at the Gates of Dawn and Momentary Lapse  of Reason. This is the perfect album if you want to be introduced into  psycheldelia. Classic rock is pretty much all I listen to because of Dark  Side. The only thing that comes close to it is Wish You Were Here, but I  recommend all the Floyd albums. It doesn't sound dated at all...in fact it  sounds very cutting edge, almost as if it's an album from 100 years in the  future. Long live Floyd and please buy this album, you won't regret it and  you'll thank me.
B000003TAB|4.0|Casual Nirvana fans are usually surprised to learn that these are indeed Nirvana songs when they first hear them. Like any great artist they have a  treasure trove of lost classics that aren't FM staples. Sliver, for  example, is one of the funniest songs they ever did, though I'm sure morbid  Kurt fans could find suicide clues in there somewhere. You also get to hear  what they sounded like before the thunderous Dave Grohl came on board: a  lot thinner, and not nearly as tight. But the songs are still great. For  ten bucks, it's a steal, and it's still fresh almost - gasp - ten years  later. There are also a bunch of other great &quot;lost&quot; Nirvana cuts  to be found on their various CD singles, which you can find in better  record stores around the globe.
6303593666|5.0|This is the best film made by the last &quot;classic&quot; Empire of the XX century. It is a must have. Anyone trying to write something serious about the Third Reich MUST watch it.
B000005J56|5.0|I only recently developed an interest in Latin/Cuban/Spanish music, so I am far from being an expert. This album, however, immediately caught my attention. Also because I am a longtime fan of Ry Cooder.<br />This Buena  Vista Social Club album is like a journey back in time, where things went  at a slower pace, where there was simply more time for enjoying life.  Listening to the music, it evokes pictures of sun-baked houses, old men and  women sitting out in the shade and talking about life.<br />Very, very nice.
0767802659|1.0|The title says it all.<br />This movie is so bad, it actually causes me physicl pain whenever I catch sight of it on cable.
B00004R99I|4.0|Coming after the four-film punch of &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; &quot;Aladdin,&quot; and &quot;The Lion King,&quot; Disney had a tough act to follow: itself. As a result, many  critics were overly condemning of &quot;Pocahontas,&quot; dismissing it as  having lackluster music, altered historical facts, and less-than-stellar  animation.<br />Sorry, guys, but Disney scored.  The songs are quite memorable  and delivered well by non-singers Mel Gibson and David Ogden Stiers.  Both  actors do a credible job with their respective solo efforts.<br />Yes, there  were some liberties taken with the depiction of such a curvaceous and  liberated Pocahontas and the ready-for-the-beach Captain John Smith, but  this is just entertainment.  Remember &quot;Titanic&quot; featured  ficticious lovers, too, and we all know how much it grossed.<br />The conflict  between Native Americans and the invading &quot;colonists&quot; is glossed  over somewhat but is still presented in such a way to cause little minds -  with adult supervision - to ponder what really occured in Colonial  America.<br />Not a perfect film but deserving repeat viewing an ownership.
0792156684|5.0|Near the end of the movie, the Gloria Stuart character gives us the entire moral of the movie. She says that Jack saved her &quot;in every way that a person can be saved.&quot; <br />This movie is a love story, first and  foremost, and on that level it excels. It doesn't ultimatley succeed  (simply because of some either poorly written or poorly delivered  dialogue), but the characters are people that you care about. I think that  all of us identify on one level or another with Jack and Rose. All of us  want to find that special someone that was meant for only us. As Jack and  Rose develop their relationship we can identify with them, and we become  involved in their relationship and eventually begin to care for them as  people. That is what makes the sinking of the ship so intense and  emotionally dramatic. Sure, this is a  manipulation  on James Cameron's  part, but who cares? It is hits us on an emotional level that you cannot  deny.<br />Visually the movie is stunning. The effects are seamless and add to  the story without taking away from it. <br />One can argue if it really  deserved all the Oscars it received, (the technical ones were certainly  deserved), but it really is a stunning movie. The acting has been widely  critisized(especially that of Billy Zane) but I would point the finger at  the writing as being subpar. Billy Zane did the best he could with a truly  one dimensional character. <br />If there is one thing wrong with this movie  it is the writing. If it wasn't so filled with cliches, this movie would  truly be timeless. As it is, it is still an incredible movie. I thouroughly  enjoyed it, and continue to enjoy it each time that I view it.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against The Machine are possibly the best metal band around.  With their creative lyrics and loud guitars these guys rock.  I reccomend this cd.  It's really great.  BUY IT!   BUY IT!   BUY  IT!
0783234996|1.0|Without a doubt, Patch Adams is one of the most excruciatingly painful movies in recent memory.  It should actually feature a warning label for anyone whose blood-sugar level is already high enough.  I felt a veritable  toothache during many of the scenes in which Robin Williams, who is by now  too far gone to realize when he's being insufferable, tries to cheer up  terminally ill patients.  I would have died gladly after one of his  performances, if only to guarantee the impossibility of an encore!   Williams is on a downward slope lately, what with What Dreams May Come,  Jacob the Liar and this monstrosity.  I see a terrific future in standup  for this guy.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have finally grown up.  After fifteen years of funk/rap/rock albums with Explicit Lyrics stickers on them the Peppers have twisted their style into a rap/alternative rock feel, with softer songs and  fewer swears.  Tracks 1, and 3-6 are the best.  Arond The World with it's  hard rock/rap and soft chorus.  Scar Tissue with it's softness and  roughness.  Otherside with it's soft beggining and hard fast end.  Get On  Top with it's roughness and soft chorus.  Californication with it's soft,  slowness that grows on you with each listen.  Despite the albums title  (California, fornication), this album is much more grown up then the groups  last effort, One Hot Minute.  I reccomend it to anyone who likes  alternative, pop, the music on the radio stations, or rap.  Actually, I  reccomend it to anyone.
B000002H6C|4.0|I am a big Mettalica fan and this is their second best album, only surpassed by Master of Puppets. But to change the topic to somthing more relevant, where is the bass in this album. I have listened long and hard to  this album and can not hear a thing. In the album it says the Jason  Newstead is the bassist but I think they made this album right after Cliff  Burton died, and before they got Jason as their new bassist. Someone else  please listen to this and email me with what you think. And on another  count Why did Metallica have destroy their good name with this Napster  thing? my email is wanker427@yahoo.com
6305177473|4.0|This movie was pretty good.  Everything with it was great but there was something missing in it.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  I actually give it 41/2 stars but I might give it five the next review around.   Anyway, you should see this.  If you find what's missing, tell me.  Go see  this.  I wouldn't rush to but I'd see it pretty soon.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden is like a breath of fresh air--intelligent lyrics and an engaging sound. In an age of technology and interpersonal alienation, it's nice to hear music about real feelings and deep relationships,  presented  with sincerity and heart.  Thank you, Australia, for offering up this very  appetizing treat to jaded palates in America and elsewhere.
6305265488|1.0|This movie was just horrible!  I'd rather see the cartoon version by Disney then this.  You never get hooked in with a plot, if you can even find out the plot.  The acting is done horriblly.  The directing is also  horrible.  There is nothing right with this movie except the fact that Drew  Barrymore is in it.  Even she's horrible in this movie.  Go see a good  movie with her in it like The Wedding Singer.  Skip this movie, but if you  must, rent it first.  Trust me, you won't like it.
630587493X|5.0|I keep a lot of odd hours. I popped Bicentennial Man in my VCR around 3 in the morning thinking it would put me to sleep....WRONG!   This was an excellent movie, it kept me riveted to the screen. Robin Williams seems to  have a magic about him in movies like this.  Touchstone gives this movie a  very Disneyesque feel.  The story is great and you will love Andrew and the  relationships that he forms with people.  Sam Neill and Oliver Platt are  very good supporting actors in this movie.  Overall, there are quite a few  moments that will make you laugh...some that might make you cry, but its an  excellent movie, that both you and your kids or other loved ones can enjoy  together!  Highly Recommended!
B00004THAY|5.0|can't help but move your head, tap your feet and love the blues. thanks good music
B00000JZIK|5.0|When I read these reviews, I was amazed to see that hardly anyone mentioned the incredible performance of Benicio Del Toro. As Fenster, Del Toro's abilities as one of the finest charcter actors of our time shine.  His unusual delivery,  impeccable timing, physical acting and expressive  features allow him to give his character amazing depth. He creates layers  for his characters and systematically peels them back. His mumbling,  hiariously accented delivery of his lines and his jerky movements provide  the film with the comic releif it needs. You may not know what to make of  Fenster (or even what he's saying), but you're garanteed to laugh. Del Toro  has amazing charisma and steals all of his scenes. My only complaint with  the film is that he doesn't get enough screen time. With several films  coming out soon, he will hopefully get the recognition he deserves. I can't  praise him enough- he is fantastic.  In addition to Del Toro's magnetic  performance, Kevin Spacey's portrayl of Verbal Kint is womderful. Both men  are tremendous physical actors, defining their characters through their way  of moving and speaking. Spacey's acting is so different from that of a  typical Hollywood star that I'm not at all surprised by some of the  negatice reactions to it.  However, Spacey plays a man who himself must act  during his testimony, which justifies his somewhat self-conscious and  akward performance. The rest of the cast is also terrific, with the  possible exception of Gabriel Byrne, whose performance seems strained at  times. Stephen Baldwin is a real surprise- he creates a volatile and  violent character. Kevin Pollack's charcacter provides a sarcastic and  down-to-earth center for the more flamboyant cast members. Both Palminteri  and Postlethwaite give strong performances. As for the plot twist at the  end- it may not be entirely surprising, but it doesn't negate the entire  film. Most of the major events have to have happened for proof of them  exists. The point isthat Soze wanted to destroy the men who were in his  way without giving away his identity or that of his colleagues. I also  think he wanted to have a little fun with the arrogant cops. Regardless of  the ending, the movie is worth seeing if only for the acting. It is also  stylishly directed and filmed with a smart and darkly humorous script.
B00000IPAX|3.0|My friend seems to think that Blink-182 is not punk.  If you think that they are punk, please click on the &quot;Yes&quot; button below.  If you believe that this album does not reflect punk, click on the &quot;No&quot;  button below.  The question, obviously, is: Is Blink-182 a punk band?
B00000JZIK|5.0|When I read these reviews, I was amazed to see that hardly anyone mentioned the incredible performance of Benicio Del Toro. As Fenster, Del Toro's abilities as one of the finest charcter actors of our time shine.  His unusual delivery,  impeccable timing, physical acting and expressive  features allow him to give his character amazing depth. He creates layers  for his characters and systematically peels them back. His mumbling,  hiariously accented delivery of his lines and his jerky movements provide  the film with the comic releif it needs. You may not know what to make of  Fenster (or even what he's saying), but you're garanteed to laugh. Del Toro  has amazing charisma and steals all of his scenes. My only complaint with  the film is that he doesn't get enough screen time. With several films  coming out soon, he will hopefully get the recognition he deserves. I can't  praise him enough- he is fantastic.  In addition to Del Toro's magnetic  performance, Kevin Spacey's portrayl of Verbal Kint is womderful. Both men  are tremendous physical actors, defining their characters through their way  of moving and speaking. Spacey's acting is so different from that of a  typical Hollywood star that I'm not at all surprised by some of the  negatice reactions to it.  However, Spacey plays a man who himself must act  during his testimony, which justifies his somewhat self-conscious and  akward performance. The rest of the cast is also terrific, with the  possible exception of Gabriel Byrne, whose performance seems strained at  times. Stephen Baldwin is a real surprise- he creates a volatile and  violent character. Kevin Pollack's charcacter provides a sarcastic and  down-to-earth center for the more flamboyant cast members. Both Palminteri  and Postlethwaite give strong performances. As for the plot twist at the  end- it may not be entirely surprising, but it doesn't negate the entire  film. Most of the major events have to have happened for proof of them  exists. The point isthat Soze wanted to destroy the men who were in his  way without giving away his identity or that of his colleagues. I also  think he wanted to have a little fun with the arrogant cops. Regardless of  the ending, the movie is worth seeing if only for the acting. It is also  stylishly directed and filmed with a smart and darkly humorous script.
0380002930|5.0|I first read &quot;Watership Down&quot; a long time ago- I believe I was in 3rd grade when I first tackled it. As people who've read this book know, that is a pretty young age to read something like this- but, luckily, even  at the age I had an aptitude for great literature, and this book is  definitely great literature. Even now, much later, I still think of  Watership Down as one of the best books I've ever read.<br />Of course, this  book may not be for everyone. The first factor that probably makes the  biggest difference is that this book is pretty much about talking animals.  I know that many people simply imagine this concept and decide that this  book is not for them. And, in fact, that may be true; I know many people  who probably would not come away from this book enlightened, or happier for  the effort. However, if you give it a chance, there's a very good  probability that you will be glad you did.<br />You see, unlike the classic  idea of talking animals, which dominates most Disney movies, this book  approaches the entire concept differently; instead of simply imposing human  thoughts and personalities superficially onto the animals, mainly rabbits,  Richard Adams (the author) develops his characters as any characters should  be developed; slowly, carefully, but deliberately. Despite the fact that  the characters aren't human, they hold almost all aspects of human  characters, and in the end they become quite realistic.<br />In its  simplicity, this story is a classic story of adventure, discovery, and the  pursuit of righteousness and freedom. It begins surprisingly dramatically,  with a desperate escape by a band of rabbits from their warren (community).  The rabbits are driven from this warren, and narrowly escape a terrible  destruction from man. For the rest of the book the story follows this band  of rabbits and their adventures searching for a new home. While this seems  like a classic formula story, the plot becomes very complex and enjoyable,and by the time you read to the end, in which a final battle must take  place, you most likely won't be able to put the book down.<br />As I said,  this story in its simplest form is a classic story of adventure. However,  upon closer examination you notice many things that make it much deeper;  things like philosiphical questions of ethics and freedom, subtle but  complex ideas that give this story its true power. All of this is  encompassed in this book, and it is wonderfully told. Richard Adams' work  is full of suspense and drama- the mood and tone of it make it come across  beautifully. And, as the reader finds out, there is underlying meaning-  often the rabbits' societies mirror our own in an eerie, subtle  way.<br />Overall, this book is extremely worthwhile, and succeeds on all  levels. If you are willing to give this book a chance, you will surely be  rewarded with a great experience and a broader view on life itself.
0785787828|5.0|This book is about an astraunamer whom was a child prodigy when she was young, always ahead of class. Her and her team intercept a transmission from deep space where what they think are given instructed to build a  machine that is supposed to transport them to a star in lira constellation.      This book was written by the same author and scientist who wrote  &quot;Dragon of Eden&quot;, and &quot;The Cold and the Dark&quot;.Carl  Sagan
B000002MG1|5.0|Even years after the release of Automatic for the People, when R.E.M. is not as sure a thing as it once was, and the market is saturated with teen pop stars, teen pop star wannabe's, and rappers who's music is so profane  it can't be played on the radio, this album is just as great as it always  was. It's one of the best albums of the decade, in my opinion. This is a  pinnacle of R.E.M.'s achievments.<br />The music in this album is great in so  many ways- for one, it achieves a great expression of feeling; it is  melancholy and uplifting at the same time. It has something to say, and the  message always fits the mood presented by the songs. It has its exuberant  moments, and it has its sad moments. Every song shines with its own beauty,  something that can't be said about most music, especially the pop music of  today.<br />This album, unlike many others, is very enduring, and will live on  as a great achievment of alternative music. Anyone can enjoy it- it speaks  to people of all ages, and it succeeds greatly in its mission to make great  music.
B000023X9W|2.0|As a hard-core Neil Young fan since my freshman days at college when 4-Way Street was popular, I must admit that Neil has suprised me once again. One of the great things about anticipating a new Neil Young album (CD) is that  you never know what you'll be listening to when you get it home.  Unfortunately, this reminds me too much of Harvest Moon, a snoozer. Better  luck next time. I have listened through it 3-4 times now and its not  getting any better, unlike most of his work. Maybe this is the &quot;kinder  and gentler&quot; Neil. For me, I'm still waiting for the next &quot;Live  Rust&quot;. I remain a true fan, but this one will go to the bottom of the  large pile of Neil works in my stereo closet.
B00003CWL6|5.0|It is really very hard hard to explain simply what makes American Beauty so brilliant- what it has that so many other movies lack. This is probably because of the strange plot of the movie, one that could almost hurt it's  reviews. Almost.<br />You see, in this satirical portrayal of a suburban  family rebelling against the constraints imposed on them by society and by  themselves, things are not always what they seem. A man who's barely there  is about to have a sudden surge in spirit, and will begin to persue his  daughter's best friend, who has become his sexual obsession. A new neighbor  boy, who sells drugs part time and is obsessed with moviemaking and beauty  will change the life of a very lonely, very dissatisfied young girl. A wife  who cheats on her husband will be driven to the edge, to the breaking  point, when she becomes murderous.<br />And in American Beauty, it all fits  together.<br />The true power in this movie comes from the characters  themselves- upon closer inspection they are all deeper and more complex  than they seem, something that is backed up by the great acting. The plot  flows along nicely as you discover more and more about the characters, and  in the end, there aren't really any good guys or bad guys (except for one  character, who is utterly distraught)- it's like the Chinese Yin and Yang.  A little bad in good- a little good in bad.<br />This is a movie that succeeds  on many levels; while it is incredibly mundane and realistic, it is  beautiful and vast in scope. It can be watched over and over, and each  viewing provides new insight not caught before.<br />I would suggest that if  you are over 17 you see this movie. It is definitely too inappropriate in  content for young or immature people, but for mature people who want to see  a definite masterpiece that will not soon be forgotten, American Beauty is  definitely the movie to see.
B000002UQJ|4.0|Paul's 1993 release says alot about the nature of his life and relationships then.  Highlights include his Elvis Costello collaberations: 'Mistress &amp; Maid' &amp; 'Lovers who Never Were'. They are unique to the  record because they are (Psuedo-lennon/mccartney)sounding, perhaps most  lyrically advanced, the later being the most moving and urgent of the two  songs.  Although  certain songs such as 'Biker' and 'Get out of my way' had  perhaps an overly &quot;songs for the sake of the song&quot; feeling, they  do work in the context of the recording as a whole.  McCartney's vocals  &amp; piano combo in 'Golden Earth Girl' recall the &quot;Let It Be&quot;  era McCartney ballads I think Beatles fans can appreciate.  One of his most  touching pieces &quot;Wine Dark Open Sea&quot; features the kind of  McCartney emotion and Vocal work that proves him as vital as ever when he  professes &quot;I feel love for you now!&quot; in the emotional outro you  can feel the &quot;Sea&quot;. At home with his Beatle-ness and as Positive  as ever, I think this is one of his best solo albums.  It fits together  nicely, there is &quot;Peace in the Neighborhood&quot; on the McCartney  homefront for the most part except for &quot;...a cat with a machine in his  brain&quot; and when it comes to that- i'm sure we'll all be 'Looking For  Changes'. Off the ground will leave you happy, and maybe a bit more  &quot;Cosmicly Conscious&quot;, he hopes &quot;you will understand...[he]  live[s] in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us.&quot;   Listening to this album you might just get it. -I say thank you Paul.
6305426651|4.0|&quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; is a pleasant return to movies that express emotion well. This story isn't quite your average WWII hideout plot, though.<br />In this movie, Roberto Benigni, who plays a funny, romantic  father and husband, must cope with the effects of World War II, which has  changed his life forever. The movie, however, does not start out darkly- it  begins with Benigni romantically persuing a beautiful and kind woman, whom  he has fallen in love with. Benigni is very funny, and does wonders with  this role. His character uses wit and humor to gain the affection of his  object of affection, played by Nicoletta Braschi. Soon they start a family:  the two of them, with their young, innocent son.<br />This is where things  take a turn for the worse. The War begins, and Benigni and his son are sent  off to a Nazi prison camp, where Jews and other people are being enslaved  and killed. Faced with having to explain this to his son, he turns the  entire situation into a pretend game, so as not to frighten his son. From  here things worsen- but throughout it all, Benigni tries to keep his son  happy, refusing to give up on life.<br />This movie, while very tragic, is  also uplifting. It give us a better sense of the value of life when we  watch it, and it amuses us at the same time. If you enjoy movies that are  funny, romantic, and uplifting, this one is definitely for you.
630445841X|5.0|I was warned away from this film by so many people. When I borrowed a friend's DVD collection, I waited untill I had seen everything before I threw this one in. After 10 min, I had gone through a range of emotions  from laughing to crying, anger etc.... The film reaches out and touches  people in their hearts. I thin most people are afraid of this.  Watch it  and enjoy.
B0000027RL|5.0|As far as I'm concerned this is the only albums they've ever released.  They went in a totally different direction than my musical tastes went, and thus they left me behind.  Regardless, this album ranks as one of the best  rock albums out there, and must be part of anyone's collection.
6305810109|5.0|The concept reads like a set-up for a late night comedy parody--a David Lynch-directed Disney movie about an elderly man who drives from Iowa to Wisconsin on a John Deere riding lawnmower/tractor, rated &quot;G&quot;.   The movie is more than mere concept, however.  It's a quiet celebration of  rural provincial life in the midwest, part meditation, part a series of  Americana koans.  The movie does not have a &quot;movie of the week&quot;  feel at all, nor is it afflicted by Lynch-inspired kitsch or satire.   Instead, the movie uses spaces of silence to drive the plot, much as did  Tender Mercies, only this film is much less sentimental.  The film is a  series of beautifully realized small moments, which works through slow  realization of its themes--only My Dinner with Andre has succeeded in  bringing the tiny moments to life as well as this movie.  Richard  Farnsworth's performance is quite creditable, even though his character  must exhibit an almost mythic depth of wisdom and pain.  Somehow the viewer  always believes in Alvin Straight and his curious tractor quest to see a  sick relative.  Sissy Spacek is a marvel in support--I've missed seeing her  in roles this nicely turned out.  The Straight Story is patient,  slow-building and anecdotal.  Its pace may be too slow for kids.  That's  okay--this is  a very adult film, rating notwithstanding. The roving  camera--stars fading in and out, brush-by treelines, lingering moments in  campfire flames--adds to the ethereal atmosphere that permeates this movie.   The soundtrack is ambiant, meditative, but we never lose sight that our  protagonist is riding a small tractor past rural field and ordinary people.   The Straight Story will not capture your heart, or bring you to the edge  of your chair, but it may give you a quiet moment of thought, and not many  films can do that anymore.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|Bruce and Adrian rejoin after several solid Dickinson solo albums.  Unfortunately, Adrian is relegated to &quot;Special Guest&quot; status, letting much of the guitar work remain in the far less capable hands of  Janick Gers.  There are several very strong tracks:  The Wicker Man, The  Fallen Angel and The Nomad.  In the good category are:  Ghost Of The  Navigator, Brave New World, and The Mercenary.  The remaining four tracks  are plodding progressive efforts that nevertheless have some redeeming  value.<br />There is no doubt that this is Iron Maiden's best effort since  1988's Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son.  It almost erases the bad memories  from the past 12 years.  Sadly, the production quality is not quite up to  par.  The rhythm guitars are a bit muddy on the heavy parts, and Steve's  signature &quot;up front&quot; bass sound is often subdued and relegated to  bottom end status.  There are also quite a few questionable guitar solos  that bring down the overall quality of the album.

B00003CWQ2|5.0|Fight Club is one of the best movies of last year, and one of the best in a long time.  It's thought provoking, and just a great movie.  See it.
B000002KHB|5.0|This sort of album you can't really describe with words.  It is just plain awesome...a must-have for anyone who enjoys good ol' hard rock!  Of course everyone knows about the classics found on here:  Space Truckin, Highway  Star, and Smoke on the Water.  However, just because I pointed out three  classics doesn't mean that the rest is filler.  By far, this album is full  of of that bluesy hard-rock 70's sound.  A must have!
006109594X|1.0|I disliked this book so much that I threw it in the trash after reading, just to prevent anyone else from getting their hands on it (a first for me). The book's central idea and bits of technical military detail kept me  plugging on, despite intense frustration with the writer's effort. The  characters are unbelievable. They exist in a world completely unrelated to  reality, where all workers are supremely suited for their jobs, and live in  awe of their bosses. World military and political action are presented as  though the private 'game' of about 10 people. And there is no complexity of  thought here: pro-military good/any other value system bad. The military  insights of the characters that are presented as so impressive should be  familiar to any military book reader or submarine computer simulation  player. The ending was not worth the effort of slogging through pages of  political lecture and military worship. In sum, the book ends up reading  like a bad argument for unlimited military spending, with a clunky story  wrapped around it.
0812550706|5.0|First of all I'd like to say that there are 2 things wrong with other reviews<br />this is in a genre called science FICTION! <br />if you're concerned about realism I hope you didn't read 2001<br />and second the book's  simplicity masks the underlying messages that you interpret in your own  way.<br />other than that loved it bla blah blah
B000002JEV|1.0|Y'know ,if people released an album that contained the sound of a hundred pigs being slowly tortured to death and then put a sticker on it that said &quot;Official Led Zeppelin album&quot;, people would buy it by the  millions and say to each other &quot; Wow, it's great isn't it?&quot; Wake  up people.If any parents are thinking of buying an album of Led Zeppelin  for your son or daughter's birthday/Christmas present I should tell you  that this band, along with U2, are deeply overrated.The world has simply  been brainwashed into thinking these bands are good. I do like hard rock ,  which is the music Led Zeppelin are usually classed as, so I like to think  I know what I'm talking about. Rush , Queen , Aerosmith and 70's Black  Sabbath are so much more talented than these two bands.
B00003IQQA|5.0|This is one the best albums that I have come across in a long time. They have some fast songs then some slow songs. This album reflects their talents as a band that plays not one type of music but one that has a wide  range of musical capabilities. You dont get much better than this band  anymore. Comparing this band to other bands out there is really hard to do.  There are not many bands out there that have musical capabilities like  Creed does. I guess if I had to compare them with another band it would be  Green Day. Green Day's last album &quot;Nimrod&quot; showed us that they  have a soft side to them. With the song &quot;Time of Your life&quot; they  showed us that they have a different side to them other than the punk/rock  music off of their last albums. So Creed and Green Day are easily compared.  This Creed CD is better than the first I think because of the fact that  they took longer to work on it. Some thought actually went into the album  before it was released. They didn't just go into the studio and make an  album in 2 months. So i recommened this album to all Creed fans ou there.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Not since 'Natural Born Killers' has there been such a furore over a film.  Reviews focus on the 'gratuitous violence' of the fight scenes, it's 'pro-fascist stance' and it's inability to actually provide any depth or  intelligence... However, these comments came from people that obviously  really didn't grasp (or even see) any of the movie they were discussing.  Fight Club is cinema at its most innovative, and from the very opening  scenes it is clear that it is not going to be the testosterone-fuelled  fist-fest that so may (including myself) thought it would be. The film  echoes in many ways the sentiments of 'American Beauty': our protagonist in  (mid-life) crisis, disenchanted with today's consumerist society, searching  for his equilibrium, yet is considerably more visceral in style and  content. The 'plot' is simple, (yet you WILL want to see it at least  twice!) although there are too many intracacies to into in such a short  space.  It also shows the 3 main actors (Norton, Pitt and Bonham-Carter) at  their best... not to mention the chance to see Meatloaf with a huge pair of  breasts! It is extremely unfortunate that this film has been so widely  overlooked, presumably due to the focus on the fight scenes (which as one  of the commentaries succinctly notes are not dissimilar in nature or  violence to what anyone would've previously seen in 'Rocky' films, merely  in a less 'family-oriented feel-good' context), because these only feature  in a small portion of the film. Yes, it is violent, but moreover it is also  hilariously funny and often extremely poignant.  And as a DVD it has  possibly the best array of special features that will keep you enthralled  for days!  BUY IT NOW!
0380973464|5.0|I started reading this when the first chapter was only available on the Internet. I then promptly ordered it, from Amazon, when it was published. Its taken me one year to finish, mostly because I haven't been in a reading  mood for quite a few years, and my career has consumed me.<br />Now I am back  on track, and reading for pure enjoyment once again, and I have to say that  this book is full of pleasure. Stephenson knows how to delight with words.  He uses each page to captivate, each paragraph to smother the readier in  ideas, and each sentence to tickle the readers enjoyment.<br />Stephenson  could have completed this book in a fraction of the pages, but then it  wouldn't have been worth the read. Its length is bathed in talk that only a  hacker could deliver, but in such a way that only a true artist of words  could deploy.<br />To sum it up in a few words, Cryptonomicon is a feast of  insights and ideas for a hacker, wrapped up in an emussing dialog. It may  have taken me a year, but I am off looking for the rest of Stephenson's  collection to keep me entertained for another.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I love this album...its tracks are full of so much feeling and good sound. Darren's voice along with Daniel's melodies are the perfect addition to any CD collection.
6305076626|1.0|Contrary to other reviews on this page, this movie is NOT outrageous(if you want that buy Pink Flamingos); it is NOT funny (buy Love &amp; Death for that); it does NOT contain good songs (buy X: The unheard  music...now!); and it does NOT deserve the title &quot;Cult Film&quot;  (Eraserhead - now there's a cult film). Do you wanna know who really loves  this film? People who were Theater Majors in college and now work as  greeters at Wallmart, that's who. They love it because it gave them a  chance to &quot;rebel&quot; (although in a safe environment, surrounded by  others that considered Meatloaf a cultural icon.). My point? If you want a  good Rock 'n' Roll film, check out the one's I've listed above. If you're  looking for a middle-of-the-road B movie that wouldn't offend an Iowa  corn-farmer, look no farther.
079284632X|3.0|This movie is fantasitic, but i honestly couldnt tell you that i enjoyed watching it.  From the master of horror, his debut film is his most shocking.  This will sreioulsy mess with you.<br />But still, a must see.
B000001ESP|5.0|The music of Rush has been a part of my life for 20 years, from college now to running a business, and as my life has evolved so has the music of rush.<br />     It has been fascinating to watch and hear their progression  over the decades, from my college head banging 2112 days to a more  sophisticated Moving Pictures.       This album was the dawning of a new  era for Rush, abandoning the long orchestral style fantasy rock, for a more  prosaic view of life, which comes with maturity and life experience.        Gone are the opium inspired English 19th century works, let's talk about  the real world. This was their crossover to a more main stream genre, but  not totally embracing the 4 minute song on a 10 track cd yet.       The  camera eye shows their enthusiasm and skills from previous albums, but with  a hint of their new found lyrical direction.      This was truly their  finest album, and i would guess their happiest and most confident times.  The music and lyrics demand attention and deserve it.<br />     Good hi-fi is  recommended to eek every nuance of the music, this is one of the albums i  use to audition new hi-fi.      Turn down the lights, grab a beer, tweak up  the volume, and you are in those 'misty streets of Westminster' or driving  that Red Barchetta If I could only own 1 cd this would be the one.      A  greater compliment I could not give.
B00000IPAX|5.0|this is the best album ive have bought  any one how say this is not punk rock thier in the past punk rock changed if you like this then lisen to offspring nofx greenday foo fighters ther good but not better than blink  182 the best song got to be party song
B00004THAY|5.0|These two artists sound great together.  It bought this cd the day it came out and i love it.  I listened to it straight through and can saftly say that the experience betwen these two artists sounds great. I love their  music as solo artists, but i can also say it sounds just as good when they  put their guitar playing abilities together.  This album is worth it.
6300214559|2.0|No, no and again no; I simply cannot agree that this is a good film.  While I accept that when some, if not most, historical facts are either embellished or plain ignored in films it is sometimes less unnecessary than  others the complete re-writing and re-structuring of this film based upon  the life, &quot;reign&quot; and death of Henry VIII's great niece Lady Jane  Grey (later Lady Jane Dudley) is proposterous.  Plucked at a tender young  age was fresh-faced Helena Bonham-Carter to play this role and while she  shows promise as the wily, naive and confused young royal there comes a  point when her constant wining gets tedious and irritating.  <br />The web of  treachory spun by the manipulative, ruthless and really rather nasty adults  in this film who abused their power over her and her young husband Guilford  Dudley for their own means is certainly apparent enough and certainly makes  you hate them but somehow it all seems a bit to Dynasty-like and therefore  not totally believable.<br />And what with all the pious and over the top  &quot;we have the chance to make a better world&quot; attitude by the young  protagonists?  Did this even exist?  I highly  doubt it; while I am sure  they were nice enough people they were also young and rich and probably  didn't give much thought to the less fortunate among them at a grass-roots  level.<br />But one thing it possibly did get right was the love affair  between Jane and Guilford; although I don't know it has a fact I have good  reason to believe that although the marriage was arranged by their  conniving parents they did eventually fall in love once hitched and this  was very clear in the film.<br />Interestingly enough Guilford's brother  Robert was a favourite of Jane's cousin-once-removed Elizabeth; yep the  very same Queen Elizabeth I and he didn't have the most squeaky clean of  reputations either.
B00004THAY|4.0|I bought this album the day it came out.  I went straight home and listened to it and let me say, two experienced blues men sound great doing their stuff.  I like Clapton and King separatly and I can saftly say that  they sound jhust as good together as they do solo.  This is a great mix opf  hard blues and relaxing, melow ballads.  This variety make's it a great  album to own
B00000F169|5.0|It's amazing what they did on this movie with a budget of only $55,000!  For a big production, $55,000 is probably how much they pay for one of the main actors hairbrush! <br />This was Dan O'Bannon's first production, he  later went on to write the script for Alien and many other sci-fi films.  Dan plays the character Pinback who wants to improve morale on the ship,  but the others won't cooperate. The sequence with Pinback and the alien pet  is one of the best scenes.<br />Dark Star was released in 1974, but virtually  nobody came. After the movies premere, Dan O'Bannon went to a local theater  and asked the manager how long the line was to see the movie Dark Star. The  manager wryly replied &quot;What Line?&quot;, then Dan became heartbroken  and stopped writing movies until he got the opportunity to write the script  for Alien.<br />Dark Star, in many ways, continues to be the most popular cult  sci-fi movie ever filmed. It was also the lowest budget sci-fi movie that  more than fully recovered the budget expenses in less than a week!
0792151712|5.0|Everyone on the planet knows the story backwards and forwards.  Who hasn't seen it at least 3 times!  I wish to comment on what we can learn.<br />The first time I saw this I was entralled by the love story on the first tape  and horrified by the events leading up to the sinking of the &quot;Ship of  Dreams&quot; on the second tape. I just thought &quot;what is wrong with  the world today to make money off others deaths!&quot;  I almost turned it  off right then; but something inside stopped me.  I am glad I didn't stop  watching because I learned something invaluable.<br />The souls lost in the  Titantic scream out to us!  They plead: &quot;You never know when you will  die.  Quit taking life for granted and cherish it!  Realize your own  mortality! All of our lives are in the hands of God.  They always have been  and always will be whether we acknowledge it or not. Get  prepared!&quot;<br />&quot;And it is appointed for men to die once, but after  this the judgment.&quot;<br />THE HOLY BIBLE Hebrews 9:7.
B00003CX95|5.0|Another fine work by Mel Gibson, which protrays him as the hero, William Wallace, who liberated Scotland from English rule. However, the movie missed key historical facts. For instance, the real William Wallace was as  evil as his english enemies were. <br />But this does not affect this great  movie, which had great battle sequences and a realistic storyline. It is  great to know that Braveheart is finally on DVD, a movie which is more than  worthy of the honor!
0790739909|5.0|This movie is a priceless work of art: the script, cast, soundtrack, cinematography-- everything! It is also likened to an Aesop's Fable; there is a definite moral/lesson to be learned! (See above title.)<br />We watch the  story of an angel (Seth played by N. Cage) fall in love with a Doctor  (Maggie played by M. Ryan) of a heart surgery patient who was not supposed  to &quot;make it&quot; and doesn't.  While Maggie is trying to save her  patient, another nurse says, &quot;He's going.&quot; To which she looks  dead at Seth and says &quot;He's not going anywhere.&quot;  Whether she  actually sees him or not we don't know.  Seth thinks she does; this  snowballs his thinking and he begins to question his existence.<br />Near the  end he makes a choice after some counseling from Dennis Frantz.  &quot;Free  will brother,&quot; is his advice.  So Seth goes for it. He becomes human  and finds Maggie; they share what all humans search for and few find: a  physical connection that is so deep it transcends into the spiritual.  They  are each others' soulmates.<br />This movie reaches out from the screen and  captures your heart (if you still have one.  If not, it reaffirms that we  all have free will and we can choose to open our hearts to love again.) If  you have a broken heart watch how Seth deals with his; truly an  inspiration.  Remember &quot;some things are true whether you believe them  or not.&quot;<br />&quot;Now abide faith, hope, love these three; but the  greatest of these is love.&quot; From THE HOLY BIBLE, I CORINTHIANS 13:13.
B00001MXXG|5.0|&quot;Save Ferris&quot;, this was the message pasted and said all over northern Illinois!  Ferris Bueller ditches school, picks up his best friend and borrows the friends fathers car (a nice one at that) and picks up his  girlfriend to go on a great series of adventures in Chicago.<br />Jeffery  Jones (Mr. Rooney) is the school's principal who's being tricked by Ferris  Bueller. Mr. Rooney wants to ruin Ferris Bueller for ditching school, but  Mr. Rooney doesn't know who he's dealing with!
6304595247|5.0|Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fienne's preformances are, to say the least, perhaps the most brilliant bit of acting I've yet seen. I had cried at, perhaps, let's say a total of three movies before watching this one night  on BRAVO - and never at a man's preformance. Ralph Fiennes produces a  gut-wrenching preformance as Heathcliff - hard, cruel, and yet a bit more  human than the author protrayed him in the book. Juliet Binoche adds light  to all her dark, dank scenes - and the film is mostly dark and dank - and  gives the added beauty to the cast. The casting of beautiful - startingly -  Sinead O'Conner as the author was plain genious, as the forlorn and yet  dazzling look of Bronte mirrors perfectly that of a perfectly costumed  O'Conner.<br />This would still be my favorite movie if it had ended badly -  with Heathcliff dying, kaput, THE END. Sadly, many tradegy/dramas like this  end up ending miserably and leaving the viewer with the feeling of  &quot;What a perfectly good waste of film&quot;. No one wants to watch a  beautifully shot and acted film based on a heart-wrenching novel like that.  No matter HOW beautiful. Thankfully, you don't have to. You're left with a  sense of &quot;Wow&quot; instead of &quot;Well, now I'm off to buy more  Kleenex&quot;. First rule of a critique: never gush. Well, to heck with it  all - this is the best darned movie you're ever going to watch, in this  lifetime or the next. Take my word for it.
B00004THAY|5.0|BB King and Eric Clapton are two of the most brilliant blues guitarists and overall musicians of all time and that is very evident on this CD. The two of them shred through every song on the album and leave you begging for  more. A must have for any fan of BB, EC or just a fan of the blues.
6305132984|5.0|When I first heard of this movie i was about 7 (I'm now 13) my first reaction was eew, how boring. How very wrong i was! I the choir i'm in we sang &quot;America&quot; for a concert and my grandmother almost forced me  to watch the movie. My first oppinion hadn't changed that much but as i got  through the first 20 minutes i saw that this wasn't a boring movie. This is  one of the best movies i've ever seen in my life. you may think that just  because i'm a teen, i don't really understand it, i DO! I've seen this  movie soo much within the last few months, yet i still get goose bumps like  the first time i ever watched it. the music was also very AMAZING!
0792846443|5.0|I saw, Misery a year ago and it was good. Then read, parts of the book interesting Kathy Bates did a good job. It's worth watching...
630575067X|1.0|I'm going to resist my urge to compare The Phantom Menace to any of the other Star Wars movies so I won't get into that pitfall. The simple truth is that The Phantom Menace is a movie designed for an audience that has a  more limited attention span. It is not a movie with any fantastic moment  when you can see it all so much clearer. It's not meant to to make you feel  any empathy for any of the characters. It's not a tear jerker. You don't  have to feel pity for any of the characters either. It's not a comedy  either? What is it then? The Phantom Menace is a theme park ride that has a  requirement for all riders. Leave your thinking cap outside. The entire  Phantom Menace experience for me was like being inserted into The Matrix.  Maybe I'm too demanding but I don't like movies that require you to drop  your guard.(mentally, of course) I think the Phantom Menace is a marketer's  dream because what might be faults as described by others(Jar Jar Binks)  are defended by others. Either way we all see the movie and have a ball  ranting and raving about its strengths and weaknesses. Buy the Phantom  Menace if you like but realize it lacks what I find to be important in a  movie, humanity.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Listen ladies and germs,  Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to pick up this digital versatile disk immediately!  Not only is the anamorphic widescreen transfer amazing(the quick frames of Tyler seem to  pop off the screen) but this film is loaded with, count them, FOUR audio  commentaries.  If you are a film buff or just an amateur moviegoer, these  commentaries are invaluable tools to finding out how the film is made.  We  have commentary by director David Fincher, one by Fincher, Pitt, Norton,  and Bonham Carter, one with Novelist Chuck Palahniuk and screenwriter Jim  Uhls, and one with the cinematographer and special FX coordinator.  And  that's just on disk 1!  The second disc features hours of supplementary  materials, ie. Trailers, PSM's, Interviews, and behind the scenes footage.  It is an extrodinary set and is the perfect component to any great dvd  collection.  If you can find a better dvd that was released this year, I'd  like to hear from you.
B00001ODHJ|3.0|Army of Darkness is yet another parody of various movies spanning from the past 20 years or so. Like Spaceballs the main target seems to be Star Wars with subtle shots at Star Trek, The Neverending Story and Aliens among  others included. This is a movie that I do like a lot and it's a movie that  has a lot of laughs but the great majority of those laughs are limited to  Ash(Bruce Campbell) until the end. Much of the other characters until the  end of the movie just weren't very funny. The wiseman didn't get a laugh  out of me and Sheila didn't get funny until she got ugly. Arthur never  really had much personality the way he was portrayed in this. Could Arthur  have said or done something funny too?(The same was true for Henry) The  ending of this very short movie was a joy to watch as the Army of the Dead  awoke and attacked King Arthur's castle. The person who played the leader  of those deadites was indeed hilarious and that was what I was looking for  earlier in the movie.(&quot;I live again!&quot;) It's great to have more  than one character belching hilarious phrases like,&quot; Give me some  sugar baby,&quot; or ,&quot;You got real ugly.&quot; Army of Darkness is  certainly worth its price but I think the jokes could have been spread out  more uniformly among the various characters. Give Army of Darkness a chance  and you just might grow to love it in a weird campy sort of way. Hail to  the king, baby!
0679731377|5.0|I studied this book as an A level text, and at first I hated it - I found it to be a confusing disjointed book about woodworm and arks with an extremely unsatisfactory ending :&quot;I dreamt I woke up - it's the oldest  dream of all and I've just had it.&quot;  But upon reading it a second time  out of necessity, I realised just what a gem of a book it was. Julian  Barnes is an extremely intelligent and sensitive writer, with a brilliant  sense of humour. All the books are linked, with themes and motifs, which  are cleverly hidden throughout the book.  The book is a satire of  traditional history books, under a comically incongrous title - it is  impossible to say every part of the world's history in 10 1/2 chapters! He  deals with weighty subjects - love, survival, history, and tries to teach  us our previous misdemeaners in a manner such as to prevent us from doing  them time and time again.(ref. the holocaust.) I loved this book, and I  read it time and time again. With every chapter comes a new idea, a new  slant on an old idea and I hope others will see what I saw in it.  Persevere in reading this book right to the end and it will reward you.
B00004T37H|5.0|I went back to the Art House theatre to see this 4 times, it was so good. I was floored by the beautiful animation, the moving storyline, and the haunting music. Having seen Hayao Miyazaki before, I knew what calibre of anime he produced. But nothing of his previous work could prepare me for  &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. It was amazing. While this IS animated,  though, like most japanese anime it is not for little children. It has a  fully adult storyline complete with realistic violence, which only serves  to heighten the setting-Ancient Japan's Muromachi period. I only wish I  could have seen it on the big screen a fifth time!
0440211727|5.0|The small Mississippi town of Clanton is brought to the center spotlight of the nation in John Grisham's &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;.  Carl Lee Hailey an African American born and raised in Mississippi is on trial for  the murders of two rednecks who rapped and beat his ten year old daughter.     Local lawyer Jake Brigance argues on Carl Lee's behalf throughout the  entire novel despite attacks from the Ku Klux Klan, personal death threats,  and other lawyers trying to swindle his case.  The book comes down to one  final question, can a man take justice into his own hands?  Along the way  to the exciting conclusion major issues such as race discrimination and  family values appear.            This book is one long sequence of edge of  your seat scenes.  If you liked any of John Grisham's other work you will  love &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;.  It is packed full of action and does not  have very many boring legal scenes.  Despite, several disturbing images in  the beginning this book is a fun read for anyone over age fourteen.   &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; is better then both &quot;The Pelican  Brief&quot; and &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;.   It also far outstrips  &quot;The Firm&quot; and &quot;The Client&quot;.  John Grisham's three  years of work on this book clearly shine through. &quot;A Time to  Kill&quot; is a non stop ride that will leave you up way past your bed time  and begging for more.
B000002INJ|1.0|This album was totally NOT what I expected. What's with all the Ren Faire stuff? I wanted unbridled gore! I wanted eyeball songs! Where can I find that among all this broccoli? Manowar USED to be the thinking man's Virgin  Steele. What happened?
B00004U3UG|5.0|AB finally gives you the 2d disc of their 2 Disc set release that is now OOP. All you need to do is pick up the AB Theatrical Version and you'll essentially have both discs. This contains both the Theatrical release and  the Director's release. The Director's release is the one Campbell and the  Director wanted for the theatrical release! Different than S-Mart ending,  you'll have to see it to believe it. This DVD also contain 15 more minutes  than either release and kinda shows why they were cut, the movie would slow  down too much between the action and humor. Ax says 5 Stars if you the ED  Series. 3 if you don't.
B000002HFU|3.0|To be straight to the point if you are into ODB 99.9 percent of the buyers will love the album. When i first heard this album i could'nt stop playing brooklyn Zoo that tune was dark from start to finish pure BEEF (hardcore) i  also rated shimmy shimmy ya / protect ya neck II the zoo them few tunes did  it for me the rest of the album could have been beter but could have been  worste. ODB is a artist that you have to know how to take him because the  guys mad if you have never heard any of his Albums if you decide to buy one  (recomended Return to the 36 chambers: the dirty verson) you will either  love it or hate it one or the other but you will never know until you buy  it. But if your not into hardcore at all then this wouldnt be your kind of  cd but the best way obviously is to find out for your self YOU BE THE  JUDGE...........<br />CASE CLOSED
B00000IAU3|5.0|Easily one of the best albums of the year.  Combines various musical textures with her deeply emotional lyrics and wonderful voice.
B000002WPI|5.0|Even though this album is fairly old now no mater what any body says the albums phat the lyrics are dangerous. alright there might be a couple tunes that might not meet up to your expectations but from my personal point of  view every tune did it for me. This album i would recommend to every one  into hiphop espeacialy hardecore fans.
B00004STPT|5.0|This is my first Zimmer's soundtrack, and I am utterly impressed by his mastery here. Nevermind the fact that I thought the movie was amazing (epic with a lot of subtle moments). This music doesn't need the movie to be  great. It reminds me a lot of 20th century composers (Schostakovich is the  first to come to mind) thanks to its heavy use of dark-sounding intervals  like tritones (this is definitely not just a bunch of smooth relaxing  classical music). But then female vocal parts are the sad melody  personified. This stuff is for ages.
B000002IQ9|5.0|While I am familiar with a number of artists whose live performances and recordings often rival the depth and consistency of their studio recordings, Phil Collins is the only artist who I enjoy more in these live  recordings than his original studio recordings. The intensity of his up  tempo numbers like Something Happened on the Way to Heaven and Easy Lover  (which features excellent lead vocal performances by Arnold McCuller and  Fred White), and the disarming soulfulness of the vocal duo of Mr. Collins  and Bridgette Bryant in Separate Lives easily surpass the original  recordings.
B00003CX95|5.0|Finally, they released it on DVD.  Braveheart is one of the best movies ever made.  The story is great.  Women love the movie for the romantic story and men love the action.   I have not found a single person that did  not like this movie.  An absolute must have for anybody that claims to have  a decent DVD library.
B00004THAY|4.0|Together at long last, these two legends fail to dissapoint.  The laid-back, fingers gliding over the frets, cruising down the highway blues will not fail to move you. The 12 classic cover tunes on this CD are a must  for anyone that loves the blues.  From the rock-n-roll inspiring title  track to the threadbare soulfull vocal of Three O'clock blues you'll be  jammin'. Listen to the rolling down the Mississippi voice of B.B. King on  Ten Long Years and you'll want to glide along with him and Slowhand. The  pleasure I get hearing B.B. King's voice with Eric Clapton's guitar cannot  be put into words.  This, more than his own blues CD of last year, is what  Clapton fans have been waiting for. Pick up this CD and as Genevieve  Williams said in her review, you'll get &quot;...the kind of pleasure one  gets from jamming late at night with a good friend.&quot;
6304806426|5.0|The film version of &quot;The English Patient&quot; differs from the book a bit but is excellent in its own right. Directory Anthony Minghella converted the intelligent and somewhat fragmented story into a romantic  epic. In order to accomplish this, he twisted some of the characters'  personalities a bit. For example, in the book Count Almasy is a wry,  omnicient person who views his situation with detached amusement. In the  movie he is more of a tragic, doomed lover. Both roles suit their contexts  well. In the novel Almasy is quirky and difficult to understand. To the  reader he is a mystery and a source of curiosity. In the film he is dreamy  and sympathetic. <br />The film also develops Katherine's character  considerably more than the novel. In the book we only see her through  Almasy's humorous and somewhat cynical recollection. In the film we are  directly exposed to Katherine's personality and motives.<br />Comparrison to  the novel aside, the film is wonderful on other levels. The scenery and  cinemeography contain an epic beauty and historical flavor comparable to  &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Minghella also avoids creating obvious  heroes and villains. No one in the film is particularly unsympathetic or  guilty. Clifton's and Caravagio's vindictiveness are understandable.  Almasy's Nazi collaboration is forgivable. And even the SS officer who  maims Caravagio is a reluctant villain at best.
B000002UCQ|5.0|Recently, an english magazine called Q made a special issue about the 100 best british albums ever. They asked the readers to vote for the album that was missing in their list. &quot;All things must pass&quot; by George  hARRISON is the one that shoul have never been forgotten. All its songs are  great; Harrison plays with Eric Clapton the most soulful solos that could  ever be. &quot;Peaceful&quot; and &quot;Feeling&quot; are words that come  to mind while listening to that fantasic opus, full of materials that  Harrison was silently conceiving during his beatles days. Released in 1970,  it even makes &quot;Plastic ono band&quot; pale compared to it. Harrison  never made a greater set of tunes, let's hope he will (his new one is  awaited for this year)!

0684867621|1.0|This was one on the least interesting books I've read. Didn't anyone else notice how absurd the so called &quot;monster&quot; bear was? The kinds of bears that live in New Hampshire don't kill deer and spread thier entrails  all over and would never track and attack a human. It would have been more  interesting if he had used a &quot;real&quot; monster instead.
B000002P74|5.0|I've been a huge fan since '74.  &quot;Second Helping&quot; was the boys best.  &quot;Workin' For MCA&quot; captures the spirit and ferocity of the band.  A gem of a song, unknown to many.  &quot;Ballad of Curtis Lowe&quot;  demonstrates the bands flexibility.  Buy it.  Sing it.  Air-guitar to it.   Love it.
B0000025H4|5.0|I think perhaps the most telling account of how I feel about this recording is the fact that I'm a grown man who's banished most of his heavy metal discs to the shoe boxes, used CD stores, or even the trash.   &quot;Unleashed&quot; is the only heavy metal disc I keep in the regular  rotation.  This disc not only gets Priest at their best, really capturing  the guitar interplay before they have a chance to bury it in six layers in  the studio, but it is also a textbook example of the reasons live albums  should be made in the first place.  It should bring the concert home.  That  involves not only invigorated performances of the studio material but also  solid production values; keep the sound true so you can hear what the  musicians sound like without studio wizardry.  This is my favorite heavy  metal album, and my favorite live album of any genre.  I can only assume  that if you're reading this, you're at least mildly interested, so I can  recommend without reservation that you buy it.

6300214435|5.0|When Temple of Doom premiered in 1984, I remember thinking to myself how can Lucas and Spielberg top RAIDERS?I remember thinking that I might be disappointed after viewing this picture, and so I tried not to get to hyped  up about it to avoid a let down later. Was I wrong!      This was a  cliffhanger that showed a new twist on the thrill-back-to-the-Sat-matinee  genre. Penetrate the impregnable dark fortress!Of course, what a perfect  formula!The familiarity of the Indiana Jones character made this plot line  nothing but good clean FUN!(had this same plot been done by another  filmmake without Jones, it would have taken a nose dive into the medicore).  There seemed to be a trend here that Lucas keeps repeating in each of his  trilogies(SW and Indy) and that is the obvious jump in technology!The mine  car chase made the truck chase in Raiders look like a Sunday drive!       I  did miss the rugged and spunky Karen Allen Marion Ravenwood character, but  also enjoyed Kate Capshaws Willie Scott, who was the total opposite of  Ravenwood.New locales(Shanghai, India) work well,and John Williams of  course does it again with another top-notch musical score!
B000000OSG|5.0|USE YOUR ILLUSION II is a a amazing album! Although I personally prefer I instead of II because it has &quot;November Rain&quot;. &quot;14 years&quot; is a  highlight of the album because Izzy Stradlin did most of  the vocals and Axl Rose did most of the back vocals. I think its great that  we got to hear a little change in vocals for a while. Dont get me wrong  though Axl Rose is amazing on this album, I would highly recommend this to  ANYBODY who has at any time in their life been interested in GNR. This  album really shows that they had talent and that the legend of what was  &quot;guns n roses&quot; lives on and every time I hear Slash's guitar solo  in songs like &quot;estranged&quot; and &quot;november rain&quot; it really  inspires me and makes me just wish that the whole lawsuit thing with Slash  and Axl going on right now would just end because they were like the Mick  Jaggar and Keith Richards of the 90's! And its so horrible that such a  great friendship ended so harshly! Songs like &quot;14 years&quot;,  &quot;you could be mine&quot;, &quot;civil War&quot; and &quot;knockin on  heaven's door&quot; were all terrific songs and &quot;get in the ring&quot;  is just plain hilarious! So if you dont own I AND II you dont know what ure  missing, this is what heavy metal is made of!
6305750750|5.0|It has finally arrived. The next installment, or I ahould say the first!New characters blend in fine with some of our old favorites(R2D2, C-3PO, Yoda, Palpatine).Ewan Mcgregor perfectly cast as a young Obi-Wan  Kenobi.CG effects revolutionize Lucas's vision of a galaxy far, far away.  John Willliams score does it again(Duel of the Fates particularly)!Planet  Coruscant resemble Fritz Lang's Metropolis!Pod-Race scene is priceless as  is the final light saber duel on Naboo. Phantom Menace kept me wanting more  and it just got me more jazzed up about Episode II due out in 2002! May  the force be with you....

6303201954|5.0|A famous author once remarked about a &quot;rose by any other name is still a rose.....&quot; Those words come to mind when I think of the first transition of Trek to the big screen.The plot of this science fiction film  is indeed worthy of Kubrick and Clarke, and yet because it is the familiar  pop-icons of Star Trek who play out this space opera that somehow makes the  viewer more comfortable about what is going to unfold on screen.      It is  a rather complex plot with a lot of techno and spiritual babble that will  no doubt confuse the young who view this for the first time(as it did me  when I was 11 and saw it at theatres for the first time!)yet it works  because we are all too familiar with maybe how Kirk will deal with that  gigantic cloud, or how Spock will interpret meanings beyond what any human  could grasp.Some felt that Star Trek TMP was too slow and cerebreal, that  in its transition from t.v. to bigscreen it had somehow lost the wonder of  the series.I disagreed as I sat there mesmerized by the stunning  visuals,Jerry Goldsmith musical score, and all-too-familiar t.v. icons.It  is still a rose however you look at it!
6303257844|5.0|Many action movies have been described as non-stop  action by different reviwers, but most of those movies do not deserve such a description. This doesn't apply to Speed.  Speed is one of the Best(if not the best) action  movies I have ever seen.  The action in Speed is as Non-Stop as there can  be.  Once Speed starts it will keep you on the  edge of your seat.  If you  have not seen this movie, my advice is - SEE IT, if you have seen it, buy  VHS or DVD and see it again.
0792835050|5.0|Eye of the Needle is an ingenious complex work of a spy story and a romance all woven nicely together with the work of an excellent director and cast.  Donald Sutherland is at his finest as he displays the  cold-hearted, ruthless, cunning and intelligent German spy who will stop at  nothing to deliver critial information to the Fuhrer.  Stranded on a remote  island off the coast of England while on his way to deliver the message,  The Needle, (Sutherlan's code name)is caught in a web of romance between  the local dissident Lucy and her ever crazed ex-RAF pilot husband.   Eventually The Needle destroys Lucy's husband and tries to continue with  his mission.  But could a spark of passion for Lucy destroyed this spies  killer instincts?  Of course not.  You must find out for yourself in this  excellent portrait of war, romance and danger, In Eye of the Needle.
6301562925|2.0|Picking up right from Halloween 4, Halloween 5 was one of the last '80s slasher films and its got high standards of horror. Michael Myers' mask in here is really cool. It looks a little less cheaper than in 4. The mask is  still not as good as in 1 and 2. The mask got better in Halloween 6 and  Halloween H20. Still the mask is cool. The mysterious Man in Black shows  up, and the film is very mysterious with a very mysterious ending. The John  Carpenter feel is pretty much lost, but Michael gives us some gruesome  deaths and some exciting moments. Still, not as atmospheric or entertaining  as Friday the 13th films. Halloween 6 is a little more gruesome and  entertaining, and I liked it better, it does bring a lot of things to  friction, and Halloween H20 creates some great moments for Michael, but in  an atmosphere that ignores 4-6.
0060977264|4.0|From the very first page of the book, it is not hard to see why you can't keep the book down. What makes the pages turn as the minutes tick over relays to the simple, yet beautiful method of story-telling that Mr. Coelho  takes the reader into.  It is a story of passion and courage, of religion  and the feminine face of God, of patience and listening to one's inner  voice. That mixed with the inner conflicts that humans face to make crucial  choices is what you will encounter as you read his words. If you've been  ignoring that inner voice inside you for too long, or want to get a clear  picture of what it's all about, then this book is for you. And you'll see  why.
6301562925|2.0|Picking up right from Halloween 4, Halloween 5 was one of the last '80s slasher films and its got high standards of horror. Michael Myers' mask in here is really cool. It looks a little less cheaper than in 4. The mask is  still not as good as in 1 and 2. The mask got better in Halloween 6 and  Halloween H20. Still the mask is cool. The mysterious Man in Black shows  up, and the film is very mysterious with a very mysterious ending. The John  Carpenter feel is pretty much lost, but Michael gives us some gruesome  deaths and some exciting moments. Still, not as atmospheric or entertaining  as Friday the 13th films.

0812548094|4.0|I just finished stone of tears.  I havent read any of jordan's books so i cant make the comparison like some do.  I thought this book was more entertaining than the first one in all but one aspect.  Some of the book  was way to graphic and inappropriate.  Terry could leave us to our  imagination a tad bit more my eliminating some of the sexual perversions.
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game...This book has touched the minds and souls of millions...Among them, my own.  Why you ask?  <br />Enders game is as thought provoking, as it is good.  The book makes you think about people.  What we  are, and why do what we do.  When I read this book for the first time, it  struck me...it is not a Sci-Fi book.  It is a drama.  The way it depicts  human nature is profound.  It makes you think about why you act the way you  act.  <br />The ffects that I just described are done through the charecters.   Ender himself is an innocent.  He commits horrible acts, becuase he is  forced into horrible situations.  After reading these situations you  wonder, &quot;Am like _________ or am I like Ender?&quot;. <br />Self  reflection is act of the day kids....and what better book to inspire self  reflection, then Enders Game. <br />READ THIS BOOK!
B00004THAY|4.0|If &quot;Clapton is God,&quot; as worshipful graffiti proclaimed in the '60s, then how do you rate the blues divinity of B.B. King? And how heavenly would they be when considered together?<br />The answer lies -- at  least in part -- in &quot;Riding With the King,&quot; a musical  collaboration between King, one of the giants of the blues, and Eric  Clapton, one of the giant students of the blues (not an insignificant  distinction). <br />It's a very good album, with flashes of great music, but  somehow less than one would expect from the sum of these two parts. My  expectations included hearing a set of old and new blues, born again in the  heat generated by two icons of the genre. <br />There's a lot of that, to be  sure, in tough standards like King's &quot;Ten Long Years,&quot; &quot;When  My Heart Beats Like a Hammer&quot; and &quot;Three O'Clock Blues&quot;; Big  Bill Broonzy's &quot;Key to the Highway&quot;; and Big Maceo Merriweather's  &quot;Worried Life Blues.&quot; King and Clapton swap stinging solos, trade  vocal licks and generally play off each other's huge talents -- as in the  delicious dueling notes that close out &quot;Three O'Clock Blues.&quot;  <br />Then there are the funky anomalies that in another setting might make  for an interesting album mix. But here, tunes like &quot;Marry You&quot;  and &quot;I Wanna Be&quot; seem slightly askew. &quot;Help the Poor,&quot;  an old King favorite, also seems not to fit comfortably in the mix, despite  flashy guitar and vocal chops.<br />Blending much better are John Hiatt's  &quot;Riding With the King,&quot; kicking off the album with its  appropriate sentiment, and the surprisingly passionate reading King and  Clapton give to &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; -- almost enough to  make you forget Judy Garland.<br />It's also interesting to listen to the two  blues makers side by side. King is still in full-throated glory at a  fittingly regal 74, fingers oozing his trademark fat, rich, blue notes.  Slowhand at 55 (has it been that long?) is no slouch on the strings either  -- some graffiti does have the ring of truth, after all.<br />However, while  King's deep, gritty, seemingly effortless vocals capture the essential  nuance of the blues, Clapton's thinner voice suffers in comparison.  <br />Despite these modest reservations, it's a thoroughly enjoyable album.  It's great fun to hear these two talented musicians play the blues  together.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is by far the best I've heard. I just want to say to all those who get offended by it then put ear plugs on, Eminem is real and he tells  it like it is. He lets out his anger and frustration in a song which is  better then taking drugs when you're upset. Well, for those of you who  don't have it, you should go out and buy it. Eminem is PHENOMENAL!
0060930187|4.0|Sylvia Plath made a significant contribution to the understanding of mental health with the publication of this book in 1971.  She describes the mental health care that was offered in the 50&quot;s through her novel, The  Bell Jar.  It is widely acknowledged that this was more than a peak into  her personal struggle, but a real reflection of how mental illness comes  down on you, like a bell jar, where everything looks the same outside but  there is pure confusion inside.  This novel of such personal intensity  explores the stages of the disease and the treatments that were available  to her.  It is far more in depth than Girl Interrupted.  Both novels take  on a difficult subject and give it the exposure it needs, which is what is  really important.  A poignant book worthy of continued success.
B00000J6AG|5.0|i bought this cd used, just a few weeks after it came out (i guess someone didn't like it, their loss).  i hadn't heard much of moby's stuff other than his dance-y material but this was a welcome surprise.  it's musical  beauty permeates your soul and fills one with goodness (i know that sounds  cheesy).  moby does a wonderful job with the voice samples he uses and his  mellow, slow instrumentals are his best yet (i favor track 14, everloving).
6305428522|5.0|I am a fan of Robert Redford as both an actor and a director, and as the latter this is his crowning achievement. It has the subtlety and scharacter development of Ordinary People with the good natured love of A River Runs  Through It. But it also has an understanding look at it's characters and  that is what won me over. No one is all good or all bad the film shows  everyone fairly and without prejudice. Quiz Show is powerful without  getting in your face and moving without feeling manipulative. It is what  all films try and achieve. Realism, depth and subtlety all rolled together.  Ralph Fiennes is fantastic so is Mr. Morrow and John Turturro is excellent.  If you never saw this then take the time to view great vintage filmmaking  at it's best.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Iron Maiden is back with Brave New World. It's simply their best CD since Seventh Son. But be careful, this isn't Number of the Beast 2 or Powerslave 2! This album is less heavy and is more similar to X-Factor and Virtual XI.  But it is clearly superior to those two. Bruce sounds great and Adrian  plays excellent solos. It has quick, catchy songs like Wickerman, Fallen  Angel and The Mercenary, it also has long epics like The Nomad and Ghost of  the Navigator, but it also has some new more &quot;progressive&quot; songs  like Dream of Mirrors and Blood brothers.<br />Every maiden fan should buy  this albums. It takes a while to grow on you, but in the end it's really  worth it.
B00004T0PZ|5.0|At last!  This is one of the most insidious recordings I know of, creeping into your ear until you've succumbed to its unique charms.  I'm not the biggest Ornette fan in the world, but 15 years ago a friend laid this on  me.  I never had a pristine vinyl copy, so I lived with the pops and  crackles for all this time, waiting for the day it came out on CD.<br />It was  worth it.  Ornette is a surprisingly fine orchestrator, using his  much-discussed harmelodic concept to fine effect with the full orchestra.   The texture is long, floating melodies harmonized in parallel organum with  a maniac tympanist blazing away on the bottom to keep the energy up.   Ornette makes his appearance towards the end, ratcheting up the energy  another notch.<br />The record company divided this into separate tracks in a  futile attempt to get airplay.  Don't believe it.  It's a long, single  entity, the best choice I know of for late-night driving on full moon  nights with the top down, misterioso atmospheres swirling in the air.   Dark, brooding, and deep stuff, highly recommended for those with the ears  to hear.<br />Now if we can only get a release of the concert at Lincoln  Center a few years ago where this composition was re-performed with  different musicians and a different approach!
B00004THAY|5.0|I have never been a blues fan until I purchased Doyle Bramhall II's &quot;Jellycream.&quot;  Today, I listened to &quot;Riding with the King&quot; for the first time, and all I can say is, WOW!  You don't need  to be a raving blues fan to love this genre of music.  The guitar playing  on Riding is excellent.  The songs come in a diverse variety, from big-band  sound, to solemn bluesy sunday afternoons.  I purchased this album for  Bramhall's contributions (I Wanna Be and Marry You), but it took no more  than one listen through the album to come to this conclusion: this album  will become a classic.  It is a must-have for music lovers.  Also appearing  on the album are Andy Fairweather-Low, who, along with Doyle Bramhall II,  are touring with my favorite artist, Roger Waters.
0395193958|5.0|I remember that I was 9 when my father encouraged me to read the Lord of the Rings, but it was when i was 17 when i picked it up- and was hooked, day and night, for 2 weeks. This book will forever be remembered by the  countless millions who have read it as the book which has led them to  believe in hope, and in the belief that good will ultimately triumph over  evil. A world which has been so lovingly crafted, that the a little detail,  seemingly unimportant in the Hobbit, leads to the events unfolding in this  masterpiece. Set in Middle Earth where Elves have dominance, this book sees  the Dark Lord, Sauron gaining strength - and sees the Humans and their  allies making a last desperate stand against the greatest evil ever written  about in a book.  Tolkien has woven a world so rich in detail, lovingly  crafted with a beautiful history to match - which is unsurpassed until  today. Tolkien weaves his story with such seamless power, so realistically,  you`ll be wishing you were there, wielding a sword next to Aragorn or  drinking Ent Wash with Treebeard in the shade of Mirkwood. Oh JRR, who  knows what else you might have had accomplished had you still been here!  And for once, this book has been done justice by a review,

B00003Q438|5.0|What can I say.  The Abyss is my favorite film by Jim cameron, and my second favorite Sci-fi film, right behind Blade Runner.  I first saw this film in the theater when it was released, and while I was blown away, I  exited the theater thinking...what the heck happened?  Several minutes of  extremely important footage were cut for the theatrical release, and has  been restored in the special edition director's cut on the DVD.  These  scenes are absolutely crucial to understanding this film, and I have never  been able to understand why they were cut in the first place.  Anyway, I  love this film so much because I believe it to be Cameron's most well  sculpted and powerful film to date.  Watching this movie gives you the  impression that everything that you are seeing is absolutely real.  It's a  definite case of &quot; a place for everything and everything in it's  place&quot;.  The sets, equipment, underwater footage, and special effects  are the absolute best.  I have yet to see a film (besides Titanic), which  makes better use of computer generated images, and all of the effects still  look fresh, amazing, and realistic.  The very strong cast of not quite  superstars led by Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Michael Biehn  give amazingly strong, convincing performances as real, competent people  who are forced to deal with situations of unimaginable stress.  Very few  movies do I watch and find myself holding my breath during tense scenes.   This is one of those films.  <br />As far as the DVD goes, it seems to be the  same print as the one tranferred for the excellent laserdisc box set  special edition that was released some years ago.  The image is very clean,  presented in a wonderful 2.30:1 letterbox aspect ratio, and a pleasure to  watch.  It makes me wish I had a bigger TV.  The only annoyance that I  found from watching the film was the very noticeable layer change, but this  fortunately happens during a scene transition.  The sound is awesome even  in Dolby 2.0, and I can't wait to hear the 5.1 surround track.  The extras  are plentiful, and I have not had time to explore them all yet.  The only  really serious disappointment for me in this DVD package is that for some  unknown reason, they did not use the audio commentary that was recorded for  the laserdisc version, choosing instead to give the commentary through  subtitles.  While this is better than nothing, I find it extremely annoying  because when I listen to a commentary, more than half of the fun is hearing  the commentator's voice and listening the voice interaction if there is  more than one commentator.  Still, even this is not enough to spoil the  film's five star rating.  This is, quite simply put, an amazing DVD  presentation of one of the most superb films in recent history.
B000002HPT|3.0|THis is a 78 minutes work made by extremely gifted rock musicians, showing creative, complex (and consequently sometimes boring)  music.

0790736314|5.0|I'm not kidding. I am a grown woman, have seen hundreds of horror movies, and even watching this in the middle of the day when it was sunny outside it gave me chills. In fact, a couple of scenes (like the head spinning)  scared me so bad I almost started to CRY. I saw this movie on TV when I was  in high school and for some reason it scared me WAY more now. The  documentary was excellent, and I finally got to see the notorious  &quot;spider-walk&quot; scene that was cut out. I wanted to see this part  for a long time, ever since I heard about it, but I didn't think I'd get to  because I don't have a DVD player. I was thrilled that it was included, but  YEEEESH it gave me the creeps. I think it was a great idea to re-master the  sound, as the sound is one of the most frightening aspects of the movie. It  rightly deserved the 1973 Academy Award for best sound. Her voice is creepy  enough, but these horrible animal-like sounds come out of this little girl  that make every hair on your body stand on end. I also didn't think upon a  second viewing that I would find any scenes shocking as it takes a lot to  shock me, and I am not exaggerating. Well, the scene with the crucifix made  my jaw drop and I had to cover up my eyes, I couldn't watch! ( if you are  easily shocked I would seriously recommend either fast-forwarding or NOT  looking during this scene). What's also interesting in the documentary is  hearing about how rough a shoot it was. Evidently Friedkin is not very  well-liked by most of the actors who have worked with him, and you will  find out they have good cause for this. But I have to admit, he got  results, and this is one HELL of a great movie.

0790729989|5.0|Seven is a very disturbing thriller about a serial killer,John Doe(Kevin Spacey), killing people via examples of the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath.       The story begins with  Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan  Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and  Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place.  This is a very disturbing movie. It will keep you enthralled and glued to  your seat for the entire 127 minutes. Indeed, I was staggered that I never  once lost concentration or was bored with this movie.This is a movie with  an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at  all a &quot;Hollywood&quot; style ending. <br />The disc itself. The movie is  presented in its origianl form, 2.35:1 aspect ratio, letterboxed not  Anamorphic.The picture is dark in itself however the detail is quite good  and crisp with very few problems (odd shimmer effect in certain scenes).  The sound is recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 which has no audio sync problems  and the use of the surround mainly during rain sequences adding tone. The  track was bass heavy in spots and gave the .1 channel a working. There is a  small section of extras , a 6 min featurette, production notes and Star  bios. My only complaint is this disc however a FLIPPER, yes it is on 2  sides!, split after the conversation between Morgan freeman and Gweneth  Paltrow in the coffee shop. Just as suspense is building the film requires  a turn over. Please note film distrubutors this is annoying and in the age  of DVD unnecessary.I hope that the film is re-released as a dual layered  film and includes some of the extras from the Lasedisc version. <br />All said  and done the film is one of the best, along with Silence of the Lambs, in  its genre and the disc even with its faults is a qaulity purchase.

B00003CWPR|2.0|Simple movie, so I'll keep my review simple too!<br />If you're a pseudo-intellectual who loves to read meaning into anything called 'art', this film is for you. If you're looking for a film for it's  entertainment  value, then you should look someplace else.<br />My take on the film is that  it's a simple plot where a man's wife reveals to him that she's had sexual  urges that were so strong that she would have thrown away her family if she  had been given the chance to fulfill them.  This revelation stuns the  husband and then as time passes, numerous women suddenly begin to throw  themselves at his feet further challenging his view of his wife's sexual  needs and urges. More time passes and now in his mind's eye his wife is  ready to bed every man she meets, so either out of spite or maybe a sense  of freedom, he begins to explore his 'needs'. The movie ends with the  infamous orgy session which didn't really have anything to do with the rest  of the story line but it did add a bit of much needed drama.<br />End point: A  lot of hype, not much else.

B000002VMD|5.0|As a commercial piece of engineered pop, records do not get any better than this Babyface-produced collection of smash hits.  You need not have seen the film, which is far inferior to the record, to enjoy the songs  included here.  Whitney Houston's performances are powerhouse, to say the  least, and the fabulously imaginative pairing of her then-stunning lung  power with Dolly Parton's wonderful song I Will Always Love You creates an  memorable classic pop-yodel of love, loss and emotion.  All of the cuts are  supremely enjoyable, though, and cross all strata of tastes and styles.

B00004SCX6|4.0|This is definitely a good dance album and it does have some very good slower songs.  The only downfall is that there is no more umph to her voice than in the first album.  She does not have the vocal range that Christina  Aguilera has but her songs are making up for it.  Oops..I did it again is  her first release off of the album and one of my favorites.  There are four  more on the album that have the same amount of attitude and beat to  them....&quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Don't go knockin' on my door&quot;,  &quot;Satisfaction(I can't get no)&quot;, and &quot;What you see is what  you get&quot;.  Each song is unique and different and all could be hits.   On the first album &quot;Baby one more time&quot;, some of the songs were  immature and just not hit material, but this second album differs in  maturity and style. She definitely will do good with this album.
630179513X|3.0|No, it isn't the best - the love interest with Mary Steenberger had a wrinkle in time that made little sense, but not enough to worry about.<br />The Old West scenes were fun to watch, though, and if you have a  kid who likes trains, this may be their favorite movie in the trilogy. In  this version, Doc's gotten stuck in the past and tells Marty to leave him  alone - he's content to be inventing things back in the past, though he  must find it frustrating to invent things he can't show anyone - his rule  has always been that when you time-travel, you mustn't do anything to  change the future.<br />Marty ends up back in the wild west in the Delorean,  the very time-machine that needs plutonium to get it moving fast enough to  warp into another time. When he lands, he manages to gouge a hole in the  fuel tank, and eventually he realizes he's not going to find much plutonium  in the Old West.<br />Oh, no!  Are they stuck in the past forever? Not very  likely, as Doc figures out how he can get them back to the future.<br />It is  also frustrating for those of us who enjoy these movies that that some are  in DVD, some in VHS, and the first is in limbo.  However, eventually  they'll all be out in DVD.<br />For now, I ordered all three in VHS format  recently 'somewhere' - the first remains the best and our favorite, but you  really have to have them all if you're going to fully enjoy them.<br />These  movies are GREAT for the whole family to watch - we did these as a marathon  one week-end, and was it fun.  The first one is still the favorite, but  that's because it lays the groundwork for this one and the next.<br />Just a  little heads up for parents of young kids -I was surprised in watching this  for the umpteenth time, but with a mom's eye and ear, to hear several  really unnecessary cusswords scattered throughout all three movies. Oh,  nothing to bad, but they could have been left out entirely.  My 8-year  old's eyes popped open - he knows that swear words are kind of a lazy  person's short cut for saying what they want to - usually used by those low  in vocabulary, weak on creative expression - but we just frowned a little,  scratched our heads, and decided not to worry.<br />For those who don't have  kids and think I'm being too prissy, just wait til ya have kids of your  own!ind of a lazy  person's short cut for saying what they want to - usually used by those low  in vocabulary, weak on creative expression - but we just frowned a little,  scratched our heads, and decided not to worry. <br />For those who don't have  kids and think I'm being too prissy, just wait til ya have kids of your  own!
6301095294|2.0|In 1967, Paul McCartney came up with an idea for a follow up to Sgt. Pepper; a TV special, written and directed by the Beatles themselves, where they would board a bus with a bunch of crazies and film whatever happened.   Now, on album, the Beatle's are unsurpassed, but they knew little to  nothing about making their own film and it shows.  This is a weird,  improvised movie that despite a great soundtrack seems a lot longer than it  is.  The nonmusical sequences are sloppy, with everyone talking at once and  no one sure where they are going next.  The musical sequences range from  good to bad.  George's \\"Blue Jay Way\\" is the best musical sequence, despite  being one of the weaker songs, and John's \\"I am the Walrus\\", gives you  images that are as strange as the song.  The worst has to be \\"Your Mother  Should Know\\", where the Beatles shuffle around in a big Busby Berkeley like  production that only emphasizes what an amateurish project MMT is.   This shouldn't dissuade you from buying the soundtrack, which is very good,  especially as it has several songs not in the movie.  Sadly, the CD does  not include the booklet that came with the original LP.  In it were stills  from the movie as well as a comic book adaptation that was far more  entertaining than the movie itself!  A previous review summed it up nicely,  for completes only.
0394720288|5.0|One of Wodehouse's most hilarious Bertie and Jeeves novels, _The Code of the Woosters_ will keep you in stitches.  Wodehouse throws in all the vital ingredients including the star-crossed love of an old school chum, a  mistaken engagement, a hideous piece of old silver and--of course--Jeeves.  All other writers should take P.G. Wodehouse's correspondence course.
B0000004V2|5.0|I bought this album when it came out in 1989 on an import cassette and then on an import CD so it didn't include &quot;fools gold&quot;. To say this is the best debut album of all time is an understatement. I still  listen and marvel at its brilliance over 10 years later. Definitely going  into the &quot;10 albums i need on a deserted island&quot; along with  Hatful of Hollow, Technique, OK Computer and several others.
0553208845|5.0|I have just finished reading Siddhartha for the second time in my life.  First time was about 10 years ago.  I didn't expect this book to have such a powerful effect on me this time around. The book is short and simple, but  very profoundly and poetically written.  Siddhartha's search, struggle,  suffering and finally peace, become the reader's.  The book's content spoke  to me directly, and will probably do the same for anyone searching for  meaning beyond the observable, the material, the emphemeral.  It is a treat  for the soul.
B000001FZK|5.0|Talk Talk's final album was probably meticulously planned and structured - yet somehow it comes across as a spontaneous, flowing jam session. A highly eclectic work, it combines jazz, classical and blues influences, and even  seems to anticipate future musical trends such as trip-hop, acid jazz and  even industrial ambient. These diverse elements, however, are always used  judiciously. Mark Hollis and his fellow musicians understand the importance  of space within the music, and they build up layers and pare them back with  remarkable subtlety. An album of focussed passion, with an  emotional range  sometimes bordering on the spiritual, it's a worthy companion piece to its  predecessor 'Spirit of Eden'. Once pigeon-holed into the early 80's  synth-pop genre, Talk Talk departed a decade or so later totally  transformed. This album is proof positive.
0767903854|3.0|Having been a Bill Bryson fan for the last 10 years, I couldn't wait for the latest Bryson offering. Did &quot;In A Sunburned Country&quot; make me laugh out loud? Nah. Not like &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; did. Now THAT  was a side splitter. The odd chortle here &amp; there is the best I could  muster whilst reading &quot;Sunburned&quot;.<br />But, a travel book does not  have to be a rollicking riot of laughs to be a success. But it does have to  give an informative, balanced view of the country in question. Which  &quot;In A Sunburned Country&quot; does not. Contrary to popular opinion,  we do not all live in the outback with the 'roos &amp; emus. The majority  of Australians live in the major cities, more at home with hailing a taxi  than fondling a wombat. I feel Bryson should have spent much more time in  the cities, to give a truly balanced view of Australia.<br />And too many  history lessons contained in this book. Stop already! If I want to read  Australian history I will sink my teeth into the &quot;The Fatal  Shore&quot;. I don't need history crammed down my throat in a travel  book.<br />When it comes to Bill Bryson I want savage asides, blinding wit,  &amp; informative titbits about the country in question. Not an unbalanced,  rural view of a country that does NOT have constant sunshine! Melbourne in  winter is not pleasant. And speaking of chilly places in winter, poor  Tasmania barely rates a mention! A truly beautiful place, well worth a  visit.<br />I await Bill Bryson's next book with interest. May he rediscover  his acerbic wit in the meantime.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Definitely one of the best on my shelf right now. If you like roadtrip songs, you have to buy this cd! Parallel Universe is great- kind of techno-like, but with a great melody. Scar Tissue is a wonderfully written  song, but definitely overplayed on the radio, so I'm sick of it right now.  Let's see...what else? I was reading some of the other customer reviews for  Californication- someone described &quot;Otherside&quot; as beautiful; I  think that's the perfect word. I've heard it so many times, but I'm not  sick of it yet! I really like Savior too- it's not as laidback as the other  songs, but it's very emotional- it has that something extra that I like in  certain songs. Oh, something that might encourage you to buy this cd- I  went out yesterday and bought 5 new cds, but I have hardly listened to any  of them because I've been listening to Californication. After having it for  2 weeks, I just keep coming back to it. The other cds just don't compare!
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Brave New World, while borrowing from Huxley's monumental work, seems to say something about how metal has changed over the past twenty years.  Iron Maiden is probably the only band left of the long hair and leather days to  still be commercially viable and at the same time have the same old classic  sound.  Brave New World proves that classic metal is here to stay even  after twenty years.  I feel this album is a little too mellow for me, a bit  more  Piece of Mind and a little less Fear of The Dark would have been  better.  Another thing would have been to keep the guitars a little more  clear and up front.  All in all this is a great album and if it was the  only Iron Maiden album I had ever heard I would still like them as much as  I did the first time I popped Somewhere In Time into the tape deck.  For a  lark, I think it would be neet if  X factor and Virtual XI were re-recorded  with Bruce's vocals.
B000002H7I|5.0|When it comes to songwriters, I rank Tracy Chapman up there with the best of them.  True, most of her songs deal with the same subjects, but you can at least depend on her music to deliver thought-provoking views to such  serious topics as racism, injustice, freedom and much more.  The booklet  accompanying the CD contains the words to the songs.  &quot;Freedom  Now&quot;, a song she has dedicated to Nelson Mandela, really stands out as  one of the CD's main focal songs.  The CD ends with a slower melody,  &quot;All That You Have Is Your Soul&quot;, causing reflection on  materialism, truth, and life.  The second stanza reads: Don't be tempted by  the shiny apple/Don't you eat of a bitter fruit/Hunger only for a taste of  justice/Hunger only for a world of truth/'Cause all that you have is your  soul.  In this CD, Tracy Chapman delivers her songs with a piece of her  soul in each song.
B000002J1Y|5.0|In anticipation of their upcoming &quot;Masterworks Tour&quot; (which I plan to catch when it comes to Cincinnati), I rediscovered their 1973 live album (then 3 LPs, now 2 CDs, remastered). It is &quot;progressive  rock&quot; at its finest, without a doubt. It is essentially a  &quot;greatest hits live&quot; album of all of Yes' finest work to date,  and in many instances, it surpasses the studio versions. Best tracks are  &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;, &quot;Perpetual Change&quot;, and &quot;Close  to the Edge&quot;. I still get a kick out of the &quot;solo&quot; pieces,  the best one being Rick Wakeman's &quot;Six Wives&quot; excerpts. By all  means, if you're looking for an introduction to Yes, look no further!
0688062334|5.0|This book is so fresh--so different that sometimes it depresses me to think that I will never find another one like it. The characters are so different and interesting that just reading about them will be enough to  want more. And the plot is interesting too. Sophie, the main character is  changed into an old lady when the horrible &quot;Witch of the Waste&quot;  decides that she is &quot;in the way&quot;. Accepting, without too much  regret, her new shape, Sophie travels to seek her fortune but instead  stumbles upon Howl's moving castle, the home of the &quot;evil&quot; wizard  Howl who, rumor had it, would steal and eat young girls' hearts. Being old  and thus free of danger from this &quot;terrible&quot; wizard Sophie enters  the castle and the adventures begin. My favorite part of the book is Howl's  character--how he's so vain, but kind, despite his efforts to hide it, and  how his bad temper sometimes gets away with him--which leads to better  reading. Read it. You won't be disappointed.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I think this CD is better than most of the monotonous rap that is out right now, but not as good overall as his first CD.  This one doesn't have the humor of the first one and I think there are too many guest appearances  that bring down the quality of the raps.  &quot;Stan&quot; is without  question the strongest song on the disc.  Of course, if you are looking for  raps about political activism or positivity, then this is not the disc for  you.  But if you are looking for some good rhymes, look no further.
B000002KAT|5.0|I own over 600 CD's with a variety of different artists and genres, yet this is the one CD that I listen to at least once a week.  From the very beginning until the last song, you will experience songwriting and music at  its very best.  My favorite song is &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; which contains  lyrics that I can recite by heart.  It is the perfect album and my favorite  time to listen to it is when it is late and I am reading.  It provides a  perfect background for the end of the day.  Van Morrison has had many great  albums over the years but this once remains the high water mark.
B0000025JT|4.0|When this album came out in 1980, Barry Gibb was the 800-pound gorilla of pop producers--everything he touched turned to gold records and top ten hits, basically because every album he produced for another artist sounded  like a Bee Gees record with someone else singing.  &quot;Guilty&quot; is no  exception.  Barbra Streisand knew a hitmaker when she heard one, and the  result is the best modern pop album she's ever done.  Barry Gibb's wavering  voice takes a lot of getting used to if you're not a Bee Gees fan, but  &quot;Guilty&quot; and &quot;What Kind Of Fool&quot;, the two duets between  Barry and Barbra, are pure pop paradise.  &quot;Woman In Love&quot; still  blows me away after twenty years--it's the perfect match between singer and  song (and I'm praying that some overblown diva doesn't decide to do a  remake and ruin it forever).  The beautifully arranged &quot;Run Wild&quot;  will put a lump in the throat of a dead man, while &quot;Promises&quot; is  a fun, danceable singalong.  There are some down moments, like the oversung  &quot;Life Story&quot;, but overall &quot;Guilty&quot; has weathered the  years well.  And what's this about another pairing between Barbra and  Barry?  &quot;Guilty II&quot;, perhaps . . . ?
0897500482|5.0|this book is explaining all the strategies of the fighting art of jeet kune do as well as his phylosophy wich combined and explained wonderfully to anyone. how to disabled the opponent is an art that have to contain all  the aspects of war such as:timming,distances,rythm,tecniques, psycology,  and other things that also covered wonderfully in this book. there are also  illustration drawings of fighting tecniqes that was made by bruce himself  when he was alive.a very enlighting book in every sence of the way.
6300214753|5.0|Okay, I don't know where most people get their ideas about teens today from, but it's obviously not the BIG picture. I'm 16 and I saw this movie in a classroom filled with high school freshmen, sophomores, juniors and  seniors two weeks ago--and we loved it! (I came to this site to BUY the  movie)We were laughing and REALLY into it. (We were even leaning forward in  our seats in the end, hoping that the school bell wouldn't ring before we  got to see the end.) You hardly EVER see an entire ROOM FULL of students  actually PAYING ATTENTION to what the teacher is showing, let alone  enjoying it. So, take it from a REAL teen, &quot;Unless they're weird, you  kids will [love] it!&quot;
B00004T9UH|4.0|Eminem warned everybody that his second album was going to be really pushing freedom of speech to the limit. Well, what else do you expect from the best white-boy to ever step into the rap game. The edited version is  good(I gave it four stars), but I advise everyone to pick up the explicit  lyrics version (I gave that five stars, a MUST buy).
6303020089|5.0|I always enjoyed the television series. The movie was just as good. Tommy Lee Jones played his role as a U.S. Marshall to the hilt. Harrison Ford was above average in his role as the wrongly accused doctor. The bus being hit  by the train was a unique special effects act. The plot of this movie was  outstanding as well. This movie even had the one armed man as the killer  just like the series that was on television. The associate of Dr. Kimbell's  being a party to the murder was another<br />unique twist. This was a well  written story as well as a fantastic movie. I have watched this for the  100th time. I will watch it 100 more times.Buy this video,you will not  regret it.
B000002VCQ|5.0|In my personal opinion, this album has &quot;major&quot; star quality. Ms. Houston really shines on this one. I personally would recommend this album. This album is the BEST!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I bought this CD on the strength of Savage Garden's first album - which I loved - and the single 'I Knew I Loved You.' And I'm not disappointed; although it took a couple of plays to 'get into' it, I'm now hooked. There  are so many enjoyable tracks on the album, but I would have to single out  'Two Beds and a Coffee Machine' as being by far the best: it is haunting  and beautiful and I can listen to it over and over. Then I looked at the  lyrics and my heart turned over when I realised what it was actually about.  These guys possess something like pure genius when it comes to songwriting.  'I Don't Know You Any More' gets second place. Having said that, 'Crash and  Burn', 'The Best Thing', 'I Knew I Loved You', 'The Animal Song' and 'The  Lover After Me' are all well worth listening to as well. Highly  recommended!
B00000IQBN|4.0|This is a very unusual film for me to write about. I'm not really sure about my feelings for this film. When I watch a movie I like to be able to identify with the characters within the film. I like to be able to  understand what they are going through,to be able to feel their happiness  and sadness as well. This is one of the many things that movies are capable  of being able to do. To have the viewer actually feel for the characters  involved. But this film didn't seem to do that. You never really get to  know the characters,not even the title character. Instead of feeling as if  we are actually &quot;with&quot; the characters,the viewer feels like he's  an outside person looking in. We can't identify with anyone. Now,does this  mean the movie is bad? I think not. Even though we can't feel for the  characters,I found the movie to be intriguing. As your watching the  film,you just know that your watching &quot;art&quot;. The wonderful sets  and costumes really grab your attention. O'Neal's acting doesn't hurt the  film either. I do have a problem with Kubrick's screenplay. As I said,I  only wish he would of went more inside the characters. As for his  directing,well there's a reason he's seen as one of the best,he clearly WAS  one of the best. This film should be viewed if only for the sets and  costumes,O'Neal's performance,and Kubrick's masterful directing. This is a  movie you can appreciate even if you don't enjoy it. And that's very rare.
0425129586|5.0|Okay, I confess that halfway thorough reading &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; I glanced at the last page and figured out who the murderer was.  (Not that I'm suggesting you do the same thing if you haven't read  it!)  But even after that, I sometimes second-guessed myself and thought it  was someone else.  That's how good this book is; Suspense all the way  through, along with plenty of wit, great characters and writing, amd that  &quot;veddy, veddy&quot; British atmosphere to spare.  Yes, it probably is  one of the greatest mystery novels of all time.  This is the only Agatha  Christie book I've read so far.  I hope all her others are just as good.
B000002HRE|5.0|This CD is better than LOAD.  It's heavier and catchier.  Every song is good and the new &quot;Unforgiven&quot; song is reminiscent of &quot;Mama Said&quot; with the country music vibe. &quot;Fixxxer&quot; takes too long  to start but is otherwise a standout lyric-wise.  &quot;Slither&quot; And  &quot;Bad Seed&quot; border on being throwaway songs but that's extremely  rare in Metallica's case.  I never have understood the backlash with the  LOAD albums. I kind of wonder if they didn't cut their hair would the  reaction still be there? I doubt it.  I don't know about everyone else, but  I don't want to see 40yo old rockers trying to sound like their &quot;Kill  'em All&quot; days so it's only human for a band to change it's sound as  the years creep up on them.  A great CD all the way through.
B000001FV3|5.0|British flower power psych at its finest a must for fans of Traffic.A blend of pop,psych,jazz.Also check out the double cd release Smiling phases.Which includes their first two lps plus singles and other rarer  tracks.
0553108034|5.0|George R.R. Martin has done it again, and with style, I might add.  His innovative writing that was displayed in &quot;A Game Of Thrones&quot;  makes a triumphant return.  Two new characters' viewpoints are added to  compensate for the loss of one in the first book, both of which are  insightful and fun to read.  I am astounded by the way that the author can  empathize so accurately with NINE different characters, all which build off  each other to convey the hugely addictive storyline.  I found it impossible  not to care about the characters--the witty Tyrion, the grim Davos, the  arrogant Theon, the saddened Catelyn...I love them all.  My only complaint  is that magic is used more than in the first book, which slightly detracts  from the gritty realism.  Nothing to sneeze over, though.  This is a great  book written by a brilliant author.  Do yourself a favor and add this one  to your collection.
0767836286|3.0|One of the cons of this movie is its running time. Though at just under 2 hours it is not excessively long, the dramatic and over-the-top atmosphere makes viewing a somewhat heavy and tiresome experience. Jeff Bridges is  good and Tim Robbins is brilliant. The plot is interesting and the climax  somewhat disturbing. On the whole this is not a bad film, but it is a  little slow, overly theatrical and lacks the spunk of an out-an-out  thriller.
0553573403|5.0|Wow.  This is easily the best book that I have ever read.  The author, George R.R. Martin, does away with the tired fantasy cliches that started with the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;  trilogy.  Instead, he tells an  incredibly complex yet very readable story from the eyes of eight distinct  characters.  It is truly fascinating to see so many different viewpoints,  and the level of depth to these characters' personalities is almost  frightening.  I was also delighted to see that this book breaks the  &quot;good guys always win&quot;  trend which seems to have an iron grip on  most fantasy novels.  The last few chapters in particular are refreshingly  unpredictable.  Finally, this epic is capped by a stunning ending that  somehow manages to provide a great lead-in to the sequel without being too  much of a cliffhanger.  The pages of this book are worth infinitely more  than any paper in your pocket.
B000001ESF|5.0|This was most Rush fans' first album, and although I am not an authority on Rush, I believe that it is as good a rock album as you can get yesterday, today, or tomorrow.  With straight ahead major and minor  pentatonic keys,this is really a fair representation of the state of the  art of guitar in the 70's.  I was turned on to it at 11 when it was on  vinyl.  Who can forget opening up the double album to see the threesome in  perfect era dress and manner?  What guitarist didn't learn  &quot;Discovery&quot; as the first acoustic song or &quot;Lessons&quot;?   You will never here better musically sound and professionally executed  bass, drums, and guitar.  But the real beauty comes from the fact that  untill I bought the cd I honestly had never even heard the album!   I'm  serious!  Buy this cd--I will know you in your car by the drum fills that  everyone does at the beginning of &quot;Temples of Syrinx&quot;.  You'll  recognize me to because I will be air guitaring the triplets found at the  end of &quot;Something for Nothing&quot;.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This beautifully thought out record reminded me just how much HE means to me.  By listening to these wonderfully few chosen songs, I soon realized that I already had his trust in his soul. Most of all Crash and Burn; he  can call me when he's having problems with his girlfriend. Even though he  may not have the knowledge of knowing my feelings for him, he knows that I  am strong enough to hold the memories forever, all of the  100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000  of them.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is one of bb kings gratest cd's it is his best work yet to come... A+++++++++
B00004RFFW|4.0|Good flick and just as enjoyable as the first.  One scene really bothers me though.  After Riggs and his new lady are almost gunned down at his trailer, she acts hysterical for about 2 seconds in his truck. In the next  sequence, however,  we see them making out in front of her apartment and  acting all lovey-dovey.  Man, she sure got over almost being killed  quickly. Someone explain this, please.  Don't get me wrong, I still really  like this flick. 3 1/2 stars
B0000399WI|5.0|To add to the clarity, here. The &quot;full screen&quot; version of this movie includes the soft matte. When the movie was first shot for theater, it was filmed with 4:3 ratio photography. The film was edited to  &quot;widescreen&quot; for theatrical release, which is known as Original  Aspect Ratio (OAR), which is what you will see if you view the widescreen  DVD or VHS.<br />Instead of destroying the unused top and bottom portions,  which usually include information that the director deems unnecessary for  the picture, they included it in the full screen edition VHS. This is bonus  material and was not part of the original theatrical version. You are NOT  being cheated.
B000004727|5.0|Paco admitted himself many times that this is probably his best recording - sounds still fresh and innovative.Power and compassion ... incredible! At the same time strongly within flamenco idiom - compas and aire as it should  be.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album (and NIN'S DOWNWARD SPIRAL) are two of my all time favorite CD's. Do not believe any critics who try to paint a picture of simple heavy metal riffing and headbanging. This is way beyond that. Yeas these elements  are present, but the extensive productionand deep thoughts of the lyrics  are the best this genre has to offer.
B0000025L0|2.0|It was a very interesting record back in the '70s.Since that time the art of electric bass playing moved miles ahead and this album lost it's all attractivness.Remembering my impressions when I heard it at the time it was  issued I bought CD as well - to my big dissapointment. It is boring now.
B000021Y77|5.0|After watching Lola Rennt for the fifth time, its safe to say that this is an excellently written; an excellently directed; and an excellently acted movie. All of these aspects of the movie come together, fit perfectly, work  perfectly together to make a excellent movie. This fast paced German  masterpeice should be the one movie in '99/00 you should not miss out. The  movie was recently released on Video, so if you were not fortunate enough  to see it in theatres, be sure to go down to your local video store to pick  it up.<br />The movie is based around Lola (Franka Potente) who must save her  boyfriend from certain death, and do it in twenty minutes while picking up  20 000 marks on the way there. As I don't want to go too deeply into the  plot, I will stop there, if you want to learn more please read the spoiler  section of the reviews.<br />Not too go to deeply into it again, the movie is  of Lola running througout a German city to get from place to place to  collect money in time. THe camera work on the running scene's is fast  paced. Different and interesting camera angles and perspectives make this  movie a sight to see.<br />The story itself, simple enough, is helped out by  the use of symbolism thoughout the movie. While watching try to pick up on  some of these symbols in it. Even after watching it five times there are  still things that can be missed. I've talked to many fans of the movie that  have pointed out some of these aspects of them film. It really is something  you must see for yourself.
6302206294|5.0|Kevin Costner is terrific as Robin Hood. Magnificent score by Michael Kamen. Nice direction by Kevin Reynolds. Brian Blessed and Sean Connery, though their roles are small, did a C'Tres Manifique jobs. Kevin Costner  DID NOT have an English accent. Whoever came up with that idea? Sean  Connery IS King Richard. EVERY actor in this movie did excellent jobs.  Should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor, Best Picture, Best  Musical score and Best Costume Designing.

Finding out how they died, the x-men must then go back in time and prevent  apocalypse from taking over the earth! After seeing this, you will be  begging for part 2 of this series.

0380973464|5.0|I have not laughed out loud this much while reading since I stumbled across a fresh-out-in-paperback Catch-22 in 1962.<br />Most Amazon reviewers seem to comment on the soundness of the computer and crypto stuff.  I  suppose they are right, but Stephenson deserves further credit.  As a  long-time student of World War II and a fomer diplomat who spent most of  his adult life in places where you cannot drink the water, I want to make a  pitch for the way in which he gets his history and the feel for third world  countries that want to be like the U.S., but lapse into old habits.  I have  never been in the Philippines, but I have been in a lot of places that  smell, work -- and do not work -- just the way described.<br />I am not a  technical security specialist, but have had enough lectures about  protecting sensitve information to know that the author is not making up  stuff about how easy it is to filch information from the ether (or your  hard drive).<br />I also came across more than a few SEALs and special  operations types and I must say that he seems to have them about right as  well.<br />This one is absolutely worth the time.
0380789019|5.0|I was very impressed with this book. It was very original, and was exciting from the word go. Gaiman creates an eerie world that makes you think: maybe there is another culture below us. <br />Richard Mayhew is a believable character, and does things that any normal person from London Above would do. He was shown the ropes of the underground world, and did quite well for himself.<br />The cast of characters: Door, Hunter, de Carabas, Coup and Vandemar, Islington were great. The villains were mean and unforgiving, and the heroes were courageous. I especially loved Coup and Vandemar. They had personalities that made them out sort of like mafia tough guys.<br />I also loved how some of the subway stations had their own little group of people living there. For instance, in Black Friars station their were Black Friars. And at Earl's Court, there was an Earl's Court. Very clever.<br />This is a enchanting dark adventure that keeps you guessing. There are lots of twists and turns that make this book a great read. I look forward to reading Gaiman's new book Stardust.
0790731894|5.0|This movie is excellent! This is a fun and exciting movie. Everybody in this film is just great. When you have the shock of a big ego star like Segal allowing himself to be killed off in the first ten minutes just for  the story you know that it's gonna be awesome. This movie will make you  laugh and cheer. Rent it, buy it, do whatever you have to to see it.
0446677450|5.0|Several people have recommend this to me--I was not let down!  I found this book very easy to read.  It reads more like an interesting story, that teaches you.  After reading it, you will have the mindset of the rich.  I'm  considering about reading it again, to take in all the information.  I have  been thinking differently about financial opportunities and wealth after  reading this book.  This is a must read for those wanting to expand their  horizons and gain financial freedom.  This book contains no quick gimicks  on making money, just more common sense and financial intelligence to make  money.
B000000OUJ|5.0|have you ever wondered what the best hip-hop album of the 90's is? this!  gza is the best lyricist i've heard, and if you put him together with rza you've got the perfect combination. method man and killah priest give the  best guest appearances. also the 1st song on the album is the best song on  the album.
0800139151|4.0|This was a pretty good  Cowboy Movie, which Didn't  waste any time getting to  the point. The shoot outs  came instantly. Whenever  there was a Shoot Out in the movie, I found myself  talking or shouting to the  T.V. screen like the  characters could really hear me. HA HA!  I like this  movie. It  was a fun movie, that made me laugh a few  times. Good to finally see  a  strong independant lead  woman character, played by  Sharon Stone. She did  a  good job in the movie, along with Leonardo as the  confident, funny,  young  cowboy. Russell Crowe as  Cort really got my attention. What a  Man..to put up with  all of that torture that the  towns people put him  through, in this movie..and he still held his head up high.... What a Man!   I would love to  hear from other Females from America and around the world,  who are Russell Crowe Fans  and enjoy most of his movies, especially  Gladiator.
B000002BFL|5.0|Springsteen gets folkier and more political on this, his best (and I heard least-selling) album. The heir to early Bob Dylan?  Maybe, but more mature and not as hopeful.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I totally agree with Merkin-Brad, I was disappointed with my First, Second and Third listen....but somehow, like no other groups..it just ferments in your auditory canals....and comes out as a fine merlot. Most groups, even  the Seattle Bands,wear you down....not so with Eddie. My personal favorites  Light Years and Grievance. If you don't like this album....just give it  time.
6300214559|5.0|I loved this movie when was originally released, and I still love it now.  A few months or so before the movie was released, I had read Mary Luke's non-fictional The Nine Days Queen, and I was excited to see a film  adaptation of this remarkable story of noble ideals and being true to them,  no matter the consequence.  Although romance is added to the film, I really  don't expect for films to be 100% historically accurate.  It still makes a  wonderfully tragic story of political conspiracy, and the romance just  embellishes history a bit for entertainment purposes;)  This is a great  film for anyone who loves romance and/or historical drama.  Although I  found myself very involved with the story, I could imagine that major  action-lovers would find it a bit slow.  It is a rewarding movie to watch;  it is beautifully filmed, the costumes are great, it is well-acted, and at  the end, you will feel moved.
6303109950|5.0|this vastly underrated film has it all. the themes involved when decent men want to just live peaceably but cannot continually ignore vicious thugs who care for no one is timeless. this film takes it's place in my pantheon  of the magnificent seven, rio bravo, and the wild bunch. enjoy!

B00000INEX|1.0|It's only for people who have perfect little faces, live in perfect homes, with children who look like the children of movie stars, and think, as Julie Aigner-Clark seems to, that the sheer perfection of your existence lends itself to happy viewing by others.  In watching this, first of all,  my baby was bored, and so was I, but I was struck immediately by how this  appears to be a showcase for a woman who, HAD to have been prom queen in  high school and probably only went to college to meet her husband, and her  apparently perfect, beautiful, children.  All I could think of was that I  was teaching my daughter how to feel inadequate compared to the popular  girls (just in case she isn't one of them) from a very early age, because  their mommy put them in a video and hers didn't.<br />We have both videos from  Baby Genius and we love them.  They are never boring for either of us.  We  also have the Brainy Baby tapes which are supposedly only available at  therightstart.com.  Those are good too, except that if you really want your  child's right brain exercised, you'll be disappointed by the right brain  tape because they miss the mark by labeling everything.  Still, they are  far more interesting to watch than these are.  I can only see someone  actually liking Baby Bach if it were the only baby video they owned, and  there was nothing to which to compare it.  It's so exciting to be able to  put the baby down while you do something for yourself for a little while,  that you're likely to get excited about anything that acheives that.  If  you want a real education for the baby, move past this.<br />I'm reading  reviews of her other tapes, and they seem better, but frankly, I'm too  turned off of this to even try.
B000001FDI|4.0|All I want to say is thanks to kireviewer for the names of the hidden tracks on the CD release.  Amazingly enough, I've had the CD for a few years but only discovered these two tracks yesterday!  Couldn't agree more  about the cut &quot;Spending My Time&quot; -- it is reallly bad.
630587493X|5.0|For years I have been a great fan of Issac Asmov.  Without a doubt, Bicentennial Man was my favorite of his stories because, although most of Asmov's robot novels have a more intellectual ending, this one had more  real depth and feeling than anything I have ever read from him.      The  movie expands on this in a profound way and extends Asmov's novelette into  a full feature in a way I have seen few books rendered to film.       Although I have seen some bad press on this movie, (notably Robert Ebert)  DON'T believe it, my fiancee loved it so much she had to see her favorite  parts again after it was over, and she is NOT a science fiction fan (of a  fan of Asmov for that matter.)  I have also heard that the humor was also  rather dry, and I don't believe that this is true either.  Although Robin  Williams was not the zany character he usually is, many of his jokes were  extremely funny.  (Ex. A buddhist walks up to a hotdog vender and says,  &quot;make me one with everything.&quot;) I believe that the more subdued  tone he played worked with the tone of the character.  His usual antics  would have looked inappropiate for a robot who was not supposed to have a  personality at all.  Over time, his character does learn to be more  expressive, but never to the extreme extent of Williams in other movies  (Ex. The Fisher King.), however, my fiancee said that William's concept of  phyisical and emotional love was one of the most romantic things she had  ever heard.  Other comments aside, I believe this is one of the best films  I have seen in months, and I would HIGHLY recommend it.      The DVD is  well done with an excellent transfer, good Dolby Digital effects, and it  DOES have a trailer and movie featurette. (a previous review made on this  BBS before the DVD was even released, says it did not.)
0670880728|3.0|My sister abandoned this book in our parents' house and after reading the quote from Nick Hornby on the back (\\"Helen Fielding is one of the funniest writers alive and Bridget Jones is a creation of comic genius.\\") I decided  to liberate Bridget from her cardboard box in the spare bedroom.  I'm  certainly glad I did so, but not enough to rave like my new idol Nick  Hornby.  While Fielding does give him a run for the money in the giggle  department, BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY doesn't measure up to HIGH FIDELITY in  belly laughs and depth of character.  Nor need it--Bridget is a  deliberately hyperbolized character--take her seriously as a whole and you  miss the point.  Be wary of similarities between her and people you know  and appreciate Fielding's talent for exaggeration.<br />Fielding is very  strong with comic repartee (if only Bridget really had answered the  sneering \\"why aren't you married yet\\" question with the \\"Because I don't  want to end up like you, you fat, boring, Sloaney milch cow\\" that she  swallowed).  Her bits on the Smug Marrieds are none the less poignant and  funny for being obvious--it's just all the booze and cigarette-counting and  weight-watching simply does wear thinner than Bridget herself in the end.   Moreover, Bridget's love story that parallels PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is not  the worthiest homage to Jane Austen.  But if it manages to inspire people  to read that novel--one of the five funniest written in any century--it has  done great and noble service.<br />Bridget Jones doesn't learn as much as she  should, which (while frustrating) is a fine lesson for all of us.  Helen  Fielding has created a memorable fictional character in Bridget Jones.   Expect light, occasionally raucous fun from an intelligent writer--just  don't confuse her with her creation.

0451196716|5.0|I'm not particularly a Stephen King fan. In fact, this was the book of his I've ever read all the way through...<br />And it was without a doubt, a story that will stay in my head for a long time, if not forever.<br />When I was  reading this, I sometimes had to just stop, breathe a few deep breaths, and  think:<br />What it would be like begging for a break in your walking from  absolutely emotionless soldiers who saw killing you because you were slow  as no more significant than kicking a pebble on a Sunday morning  stroll...<br />Or having every step you take feel like a hundred knives being  plunged into every muscle in your body...<br />Obviously, something like what  transpired in this story could probably never happen... <br />But  &quot;probably&quot; isn't sure enough. That's the thing about this story.  It's unbelievable and yet horrifyingly believable at the same time. <br />I  wouldn't put it past human nature to devise something like this...<br />So, we  better be careful.
B00004LN16|5.0|To the last reviewer.  You are an idiot.  This is by far one of AC/DC's best.  This is a must have.  Buy it and you will listen to it for weeks non stop. If u don't I will buy it from u.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I purchased this album because Metallica can sure use the money. I'm just glad they've never sold out so they could get their songs on the radio.  I'm glad they quit trying to play all that hard rock stuff, because they're  much better at writing ballads. They put Steely Dan to shame ...
B00000K0E5|5.0|This bond was one of the best yet. Pierce Brosnan fits the role of a womanizing action star magnificiently. The action and acting was amazing.<br />This movie is totally worth buying, it's writing, acting,  effects, and action are off the charts.<br />BUY THIS DVD!
0790742780|5.0|Excellent quality color and sharpness on DVD played on large screen TV.  Great movie all around, another great Douglas film.
B00004THAY|5.0|I can't get out the house after hearing this masterpiece. B.B. and Eric together are the epitome of bluesmen and this recording is the blues primer. Sweet, soulful, blue, raw, and beautiful are just some of the words  I can find right now. Doyle Bramhall II, Andy Fairweather Low, and Susannah  Melvoin add some delicious flavor to this wonderful album. Buy two and send  one to friend and they will love you for it.
B00003CWTH|3.0|For the most part, I really enjoyed watching this movie -although the sheer level of vulgarity in it was really too much totake. But part of my enjoyment was based on wondering how all these chracters and plot lines were related and how their individual stories were resolved. As it turned out, none of the stories had a resolution, and - despite an opening montage strongly stressing the cosmic signifigance of co-incidences - they didn't really co-incide in any meaningful way.<br />The other thing I wasn't crazy about is the naivety and insularity of the movie's slogan - &quot;Things fall down, people look up&quot;. The characters include a pressurised child genius; a sleazy seduction-course salesman, a neurotic drug-addicted thirtysomething adultress married to a dying ninetysomething millionaire; a once-gifted man with a crush on a bartender with braces; and a game show presenter who may have molested his coke-snorting daughter. With this in mind, you can't help feeling that the movie isn't so much about people with problems as Americans with problems. It probably won't surprise anyone to learn that it's set in LA.<br />The acting however, is very good - Tom Cruise, for a limited role, is really impressive. And there are parts of it that are genuinely moving and funny. But the ending is crazy and factually inaccurate - the unusual natural phenomenon which frames the movie's conclusion does happen, but nowhere near that extent. I guess the event is exaggerated to disguise the absence of a real ending. Plus it's just so maddening that even after three hours none of the plotlines go anywhere.  Like American Beauty, it's great while you're in the cinema, but once you begin to think about the movie, you realise there's really not that much to it.
B0000399WI|5.0|That does not begin to describe how good this movie is.  This movie is a must have for your DVD collection.  This movie is a very heart warming story about two men and how one never gives up hope and the other begins to learn hope and gets a second shot at life.  This is a wonderful  bargain buy this movie!
6300184080|5.0|Rocky Dennis, the central character in this movie, proves without a doubt that true beauty lies within.  Although he was hideously deformed, he possessed a beautiful soul and attempted to always reach for the stars,  despite the considerable obstacles standing in his path.  Although he was  not destined to have a long life, his story and his heart will live on  forever through this movie.  A true tearjerker and a lesson to us to keep  dreaming and always try our hardest.  Wonderful.  This movie deserves more  than five stars.
B000001E29|5.0|I'm not going to try to intellectualize this - the more I listen to this album the more I like it. It wasn't easy to listen to at first, but something kept calling me back. Maybe it was because it's the only album I  have, of about 2000, on which someone plays the saw. &quot;November&quot;  immediately takes me back to many cold, wet, and dreary Chicago autumns.  And, for my money, you can't beat &quot;I'll Shoot the Moon&quot; and  &quot;The Briar and the Rose&quot; for love songs.  Give it some time -  it'll grow on you.
B00004LN16|5.0|THE NEW AC/DC SOUNDS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN THIER OLDER MUSIC BUT IS STILL KEEPIN' IT REAL! ONE OF THEIR BEST CD'S HAS JUST ARRIVE.
0767802659|1.0|To be perfectly honest, the special effects and sound for the movie was amazing. If it wasnt for that I would have probably tossed the DVD out. I find it kinda a silly movie which ABSOLUTELY 0% portrays the real way the  human race would deal with a problem such as that. First of all, we would  NEVER attempt to send in troops armed with pretty much water guns against a  gigantic insect with jaws that are able to rip apart a tank. Secondly, we  would NEVER get rid of air support or tank support and move to just troops.  Unless we are fighting chickens with sticks who the heck would send in  troops against a big bug?  We would carpet bomb, blast the area and pick up  scraps later. A bug with a brain would not be the first thing we would care  about, we would care about winning and being on top! They could have done a  better job with it.
078322687X|5.0|If you graduated from high school in the 1980s and haven't seen this film, you must have been locked in a cave.<br />John Hughes delivers the definitive nostalgic teen movie of the Generation X crowd. The cast made up the '80s &quot;brat pack&quot; with Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Molly  Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. It's hard to believe while seeing this  film that Ringwald and Hall were the only real high school aged  performers... the others were in their mid to late 20s during  filming.<br />While modern teens may not find this as  &quot;sophisticated&quot; as over-sexed comedies like &quot;American  Pie,&quot; anyone can appreciate true feelings, teen angst, self doubt and  relationships with parents portrayed in this film.<br />A group of kids  sitting for 8 hours in detention on a Saturday none of them will ever  forget. While there is foul language, it's about the same speed as what you  can hear on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; on TV. There is no nudity or sex, just  raw, in your face teen angst.<br />You see this group of &quot;losers,&quot;  warts and all, and become friends with all of them before the film is over.  The DVD doesn't offer anything other than cast bios and subtitles... which  is a disappointment. It would have been great to have had some interviews  with the cast and behind the scenes footage.  Nonetheless, DVD is much  better than tape and definitely worth the extra $ for a non volitile  format.
6305627401|4.0|I've never laughed so hard in a film before. The first 30minutes just kill me. The &quot;Uncle...&quot; song is just soaudacious that you die laughing. After the first opening scenes though the movie isn't as funny but still outrageous. I'll buy the DVD for the song alone.  END
6303407188|5.0|Ed Wood, Jr. was a man obsessed with making movies and wearing Angora sweaters. It's hard to believe that a black and white film made about a 1950's unsuccessful, cross-dressing filmmaker could be so enjoyable.<br />Ed  Wood (played masterfully by Johnny Depp) was passionate about filmmaking,  but sadly lacked any talent in that area. Through sheer sweat,  determination and lots of equally nutty friends, he got his films  distributed in spite of their cheesy quality.<br />Wood's swan song was to  hire Bela Lagosi to star in one of his films... the last performance of  Lagosi's career. Martin Landau won a much deserved best supporting actor  Oscar for his flawless portrayal of Lagosi in this film.<br />If your jaw is  not hanging open during the film, it's because your doubled over, laughing  your lungs out.  The timing is right on cue and the acting superb.  Knowing  that the story is true makes it that much more funny.<br />If you need a good  laugh, this movie is just the key... and it's definitely watchable more  than once.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I'm telling you, even this album could top N'Sync. If you're looking for a good CD, get Britney Spears' Oops!...I did it Again as your new CD.The songs are great, &amp; perfect for pre-teens &amp; teens. Besides Oops!..I  did it Again as a great song, also are Stronger, Lucky, Don't go Knockin'  on my Door, &amp; other ones such as Don't Let me be the Last to  Know.Britney, wherever you are out there, I want to tell you that you  certainly did it again!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is a one of a kind movie to my knowledge.  It's a highly entertaining film if you don't mind violence and a bit of blood and brutality.  <br />The characters in this film offer a great window into the  depths of a world where morality is lacking and you are respected more by  what you can do in a fight than anything else.<br />Edward Norton delivers  another outstanding performance in another off-kilter film. Brad Pitt's  best performance since &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; as he portrays another  character that will have you hooked. Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of  the freakish girlfriend will have you laughing and staring wide eyed;  appalled at the antics of one who is more concerned with dying than  living.<br />Meat Loaf was a great addition to this movie.  His small role as  &quot;Bob&quot; adds a great bit of comic relief and understanding to the  film.<br />This movie is heavily violent and should not be taken lightly.  You  won't fully appreciate it until you get to the shocking ending, but this  one is worth more than one viewing!
0783222955|5.0|After searching video stores in Southern California, I finally found a non-colorized version of &quot;Mockingbird&quot; at Amazon.com.  What idiot colorized a movie deliberately filmed in black-and-white!   I'm so grateful  that Amazon.com had it in the original black-and-white and I really enjoyed  the interviews and behind-the-scenes information at the end of the video,  including a very rare photo of Harper Lee.
014028009X|5.0|Bridget Jones is a girl you love to sympathize with. Who hasn't been on what seems like an eternal diet that you always break, promised that today was the day you would quit smoking, swore you would drink less, and not  fall in love with the ladies' man in your office? Through Bridget's trials  and errors, she learns to love herself more, and you will, too. A great  summer read.
0920236820|5.0|I am so happy I got this book for my four year old daughter.  It's the perfect antidote to those unrealistic Disney stories (i.e., Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty).  And don't get me wrong, I think that those Disney stories can be fabulous, but the subliminal messages are somewhat 18th  century.  The Paper Bag Princess, on the other hand is decidely modern.   Its message is: if a guy isn't nice to you, he's not worth it, leave him.   Really, is there a more important message about relationships that we ought  to be sending to our daughters?  There are other wonderful messages in here  for girls:  you are resourceful, be strong.  And, as an added benefit, this  is a great and funny book, both of my daughters love it.  This would make a  great gift to all of the  young girls in your life (and I think the age  range should start at 2, not 4).
B0000026J6|5.0|I'll never forget how impressed I was the first time I heard this CD. Thanks Eric! It isn't really like anything else. I like the mysterious connection to Velvet  Underground &amp; Nico in the figure of the banana on  the cover.
B000002H33|4.0|...it's not my favorite Metallica album. I think sometimes this album suffers a bit from the extended song structures. It's a very good album, don't get me wrong, I just think &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; is their  best, because it has more raw power and the band wasn't trying to do too  much with the songs. MoP is the album that was in every one's face when  Metallica was just making it's mark, so it was the one that most people  noticed first, but I actually look at it as being kind of a transitional  work between RtL and &quot;And Justice for All,&quot; which I also like  better than MoP. Yeah, I know I lost a lot of people when I said that I  think AJFA is better, but I really think that they got the extended song  structure thing more right on the later effort. It's popular to say that  &quot;Justice&quot; is &quot;too ambitious,&quot; and that it's sound is  too light in the bass. Yeah, I actually think that Metallica was going for  sort of a bleak, oppressive, gray, atmosphere on &quot;Justice,&quot; hence  the rather one-dimensional recording.<br />On &quot;Master,&quot; I really  like the songs &quot;Battery,&quot; &quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; the  weird and cryptic &quot;The Thing that Should Not Be,&quot; and &quot;Leper  Messiah,&quot; but the rest of this album doesn't do much for me,  especially, &quot;Disposable Heroes,&quot; which is overlong for its  material; and I think that &quot;Orion,&quot; is the least satisfying  instrumental of the first four albums. This is actually my least favorite  Metallica album of the first four, and I think that what they were trying  to do with this album was done better on &quot;Justice.&quot;
B000002U82|5.0|Over a quarter century after first hearing this album it still has the power to make me stop and listen. I heard &quot;Money&quot; on the car radio this afternoon and decided it was time for me to own a copy again  (hey, its my birthday).  While the album is perhaps too polished at times,  it is this technical precision that makes it such an amazing piece of  music.  I was fortunte to see them perform this album in concert and that  is part of the magic for me.  It will always be one of my favorites and an  album that must be considered one of the best of all time (although that is  a very long list).  It is good to see that people are still discovering  Floyd after all these years. <br />What a combination, I bought Barenaked  Ladies as well today %-&gt;
1570428654|5.0|You don't get the same feeling when you read the lines to the Oscar Mayer song in the style of Billie Holliday. You can hear these hilarious stories exactly as he would like for you to.<br />This tape collection is  laugh-out-loud, wreck-your-car FUNNY!<br />The story about his sister Amy made  me wet my pants!
B00000IL26|5.0|This album was probably one of my first introductions to jazz.  My dad had an old copy of the LP that I'd listen to for hours in our basement.  I didn't really know what was going on in the music at that time, but I knew  that it was good.       After years have passed and I've gained some  musical education, I listen to this recording and it's still just good.           I would recommend this recording to anybody studying jazz trumpet.  Go  to your classes and learn lydian dominant scales and such, and then come  home and study this piece of work.       It's a classic in my book!
0767830555|3.0|I was talking to a friend who loves this movie and we went point by point through every aspect that she loved - character development, characters, plot line, symbolism, etc.  Where she thought each aspect deserved 5 stars,  I meandered around 2-4 stars for everything.  Nothing truly grabbed me in  this movie and when watching it I always feel like I'm watching &quot;The  Emporers New Clothes&quot;.  DeNiro is a great as usual but I can't see the  comparison with something like his Raging Bull performance.  Over the top  characters strike me as so easy to portray.  The 'everyman' seems so much  more difficult.  This is a cast of over the top characters who I don't  really relate to, who I'm not particularly interested in, and who don't  leave much of an impresson on me.  I'm sorry...what can I say?
0375501851|4.0|zadie really highlights the difference between race relations in Great Britain and the U.S.  She does an excellent job of &quot;dentistry&quot; while exploring racial identity in context among the non-whites in her  story.
B000000H3Z|5.0|I guess it's the popular opinion that &quot;Arise&quot; is Sepultura's best album; their thrash classic. I actually like this album better (along with &quot;Schizophrenia,&quot; now that its raw excellence has been fully  revealed by the new remastering). The only thing I can figure is that  people like &quot;Arise&quot; better because, overall it might be faster  and angrier. I like &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; better because there's  more variety, better invention, better changes, and not the mind-numbing  sameness of the later album. It's also interesting that someone commented  that &quot;Beneath&quot; is formulaic, when that's what I would've said  about &quot;Arise,&quot; whose songs hold no surprises. I am a relative  newcomer to Sepultura, thanks to this excellent series of remasters, and  although I normally pay more attention to the guitars (and Sepultura's are  excellent), their drummer amazes me.
B000024A70|5.0|This very well could be the best CD out there.  It combines all of the hits from Queen's Greatest Hits album released by Hollywood Records plus the classic song &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.  Almost every song on here  is worth listening to multiple times a day, especially Bohemian Rhapsody,  Another One Bites the Dust, Play the Game, and the We Will Rock You duo of  songs.

0793518326|5.0|This book is definitively the best book to get on the actual music of the Beatles and at this time there isn't anything closer, Yet ! I, having played in Beatlemania, highly suggest this book to the hard core Beatles  fans. There are, however, some mistakes in this book and it is not perfect,  close, but not perfect. The book size and text size should definitely be  increased, even if you have to pay more money for it, because there is alot  of information here, too much for such a small book. I gave it 5 stars  because of the vast amount of information. It is a must for Beatlemania  want-to-be's !  I have it and I'll buy it again if they increase the book  and text size.
B00004THAY|5.0|Forget any apprehensions you may have had about this pairing of blues legend B.B. King and guitar god Eric Clapton.  This CD should satisfy fans of King, Clapton and blues purists alike.  Unlike the sometimes strained  vocals on Clapton's 1994 blues album From The Cradle, there is nothing  forced about this collaboration.<br />Some of these songs are reworkings of  some of King's earliest sides like 1951's &quot;Three O'Clock Blues,&quot;  where King's single-note leads are balanced against Clapton's more fluid  runs.  And Joe Sample's piano playing is stellar throughout. Or the slow  blues of 1954's &quot;Heart Beats Like a Hammer&quot; and 1955's shuffling  &quot;Ten Long Years,&quot; where Clapton steps back from the mic and lets  King's vocal carry the song.  (Although with Clapton now in his  mid-fifties, he's nearly twice as old as King was when he first recorded  these songs and has earned the right and acquired the ability to sing the  blues with authority as he does on the rest of the tracks on this CD.)<br />Whether they're playing the acoustic blues of Big Bill Broonzy's  &quot;Key To The Highway,&quot; a funky version of the Sam and Dave classic  &quot;Hold On I'm Coming&quot; or the electrifying &quot;Days Of Old,&quot;  these two artists play the blues with conviction. And the supporting cast  is superb, including guitarists Andy Fairweather Low and Texas blues  sensation Doyle Bramhall II. (In fact, two of Bramhalls's songs from last  year's Jellycream--&quot;Marry You&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be&quot;--are  included here.)<br />The only song that at first glance seemed out of place  was John Hiatt's title track, but once I hit the play button any misgivings  I had immediately disappeared.  There is not a false note on this album.  The only disappointment is that after sixty minutes, it's over.  If King  can still play like this at his age--he'll turn seventy-five this fall--I'm  looking forward to what clapton will be doing in another twenty years. This  is as good as the blues gets.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDs. This  is as good as the blues gets.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

B00000G3PA|1.0|Special effects aside, this is an example of Hollywood at its worst. I'm not sure, but I think the writers of this film were purposely writing the corniest lines in the history of movies. (Maybe as a joke, to demonstrate  how stupid and shallow American audiences have become) Great special  effects, but after 20 minutes, who cares?
B00003CWLE|4.0|In 1951, songwriters Rodgers and Hammerstein premiered their Broadway hit \\"The King and I\\" - a fantastical tale about King Mongkut of Siam and the tutor, Anna Leonowens, who taught all 39 of his wives and 82 of his  children. In 1956, a musical film version of the play was adapted for the  screen starring Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr. A television show and two  more films have kept this story alive for more than 50 years. The subject  of Anna and her king has in essence become its own modern theme, one that  has knitted itself into the threads of even more modern stories than you  could ever imagine.<br />ANNA AND THE KING uses this theme in a non-musical  version of \\"The King and I\\" starring two-time Academy Award-winning actress  and international star Chow Yun-Fat. Our knowledge of Siam's history during  the reign of King Mongkut comes partly from Anna Leonowens memoirs of that  time entitled \\"The English Governess at the Siamese Court: Being  Recollections of Six Years in the Royal Palace at Bangkok.\\" <br />The story  begins in 1862 when Anna and her son Louis travel to Siam (now Malaysia) so  that she can take a job as the tutor for the King's wives and children. The  Siamese were bewildered by her brassy demeanor and witty verse in the  presence of the King because they always bowed down to him at first sight.  Despite her foreign idiosyncrasies, Anna goes on to become the most  prolific teacher the King's children ever have - and the most challenging  woman the King ever encounters.<br />ANNA AND THE KING is a throwback to the  days when studios created elaborate motion pictures with grandiose sets and  hundreds of cast members. It is a story that is beautiful to watch -  thousands of extras and 1300 crew members worked on location all over  Malaysia to bring this film to life. The crew created a lavish seven-acre  replica of the real King's Palace located in Bangkok. When Anna scurries  past the guards right up to the steps of King Mongkut's throne on the  palace set, it is almost impossible to believe that the set is an  imitation. Twenty local Malay students spent week after week setting tiny  colored mirrors all over the palace set to create a mosaic barely rivaled  by the real thing. Along with ornate costumes and an extensive use of  animals, the film executes a story as grand as the epic tales of Hollywood  some 40 years ago.<br />When ANNA AND THE KING premiered in theaters, the  response was mediocre. With a less than expected box-office gross, the film  was essentially considered a flop by many. But it may be a film you will  admire more and want to see again and again if you know a little about the  complex history behind it. Pick up a copy of Anna Leonowens memoirs. The  film will mean so much more if you understand its actions and dialogue.  When the doors of the children's courtyard opens to Anna, she is speechless  to learn the King has 39 wives and 82 children - all standing before her.  King Mongkut turns to Anna and says, \\"I know what you're thinking - not as  many as Emperor of China. But he did not spend 27 years in  monastery.\\"<br />This scene will unavoidably touch your heart if you know just  a little about the King's past. Mongkut spent more than half of his life  traveling the countryside of Siam wearing the yellow robe of a Buddhist  Monk. He led a disciplined life of one meal a day and constant study of the  scriptures. Then in 1851, news came of the death of King Rama III -  Mongkut's brother. At 47 years old, he stepped down from a life of reverent  worship into a surreal world inside the palace walls. The scene between  Anna and the King in the children's courtyard is mildly comical and oddly  impressive when you know that the King embraced his royal duties at such a  late age and still managed to produce more children than anyone in the  modern world will ever have. And he did it all in less than 17  years.<br />There are some films that are intent on providing you with a  little history about something you may know nothing about. ANNA AND THE  KING does just that. If you find this film enticing, it hopes maybe you  will look elsewhere to learn more.

The plot of this movie is John Travolta plays FBI agent Sean Archer who is  tracking down Nicolas Cage's Character Castor Troy. Archer catches Troy in  an exciting air-plane hanger sequence. Archer then ''swicthes'' faces with  Troy who is in a coma, to find this bomb Troy placed somewhere in the city  of L.A. So while Archer is pretending to be Troy, Troy comes out of his  coma and takes Archer's face.If your lost don't fear theres a great action  scene every 15 mins.

6305587760|5.0|Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze redefine what true love means in this masterpiece of a film!  Whoopi Goldberg adds flare as the psychic Oda Mae Brown who channels Sam (Swayze) in order to reach his girlfriend Molly  (Moore) in order to keep her from being killed by the same guy who killed  him.  The plot is great and definitely does not detract from the film.   With comedy, drama, action, and romance, this movie is definitely a keeper!
B00004T9UF|4.0|When I first heard 'The Real Slim Shady' on the radio, I got pretty excited about the album. While I'm not really a fan, this album is far more interesting than the first. The Public Service Announcement is pretty damn  funny, as are 'Ken Kaniff' and 'Kill You'. I was really surprised when I  heard this album- 'Stan' shows Eminem does have a conscience and is aware  of the innocence of most people even though his lyrics would suggest he  doesn't particularly care for anyone. As a rapper, he seems to have  improved on his technique and the beats on this album are so much better  than on his first attempt. What grabbed me about this album most is the  potential for excellent hooks like the one in the chorus of 'The Real Slim  Shady'. Eminem cynics beware- this could change everything you ever  considered Shady to be.
B00003CX5A|4.0|Tim Burton, as always shows his powerful views through visualization. The style of this movie could be compared to his earlier batman movies, only instead of creating a highly industrialized city, he lessens the tone to an  eerie, old-fashioned town in 1799. The effect is stirring. The town of  Sleepy Hollow alone is enough to give anyone the shivers. However it is the  dark tale behind it that can keep you awake at night long after the movie  has finished. Everyone is familiar to the Tale of Sleepy Hollow. We all saw  the animated version a while back. Now Ichabod is a constable instead of a  schoolmaster, but he still has the funny little quirks of the original.  Even though he has strong motivation for finding out what really happened  to the victims, he is still a shivering coward for large portions of the  movie when it comes to encounters with the dead.        Through the new  screenplay, the story receives many a new twist. A whole new subplot joins  in involving the possessor of the horseman's head, and a bit of background  of the horseman himself (played by a growling and screaming Christopher  Walken, who utters not one intelligeable word throughout his short  appearances in the film). The screenwriter gives the movie a bit of a zany  feel. The screenplay itself is not very well written, but surprisingly  contrary to the atmosphere, this, as a movie, was not meant to be taken  seriously (like Fight Club). There are quite a few clever lines (Villiany  wears many masks, none of which are more dangerous than virtue.&quot;).  Unfortunately every clever line has it's opposer (&quot;Ah. Just in time to  get your head chopped off&quot;).      All in all, this came out to be one  of the most entertaining atmospheric, period movies of last year. Quite a  bit of suspension of disbelief is necessary, but due to wonderful art  direction mixed with beautiful (though by the book) cinematography, it is  not too hard to believe in a town upstate, haunted by the legendaryHeadless Horseman. . .
6305750750|5.0|The Star Wars saga is to film what The Lord of The Rings is to literature.To judge this film as a stand alone movie is wrong, it must be judged in the context of the other three existing films. And with that in  mind it remains faithful to the tradition which makes Episodes 4-6  great(memorable music,dialogue, story,characters, etc).  Lucas answers some  of our questions and poses many new ones. Ok so maybe u don't like Jar Jar  but he is not the only character in the film! There are a diverse range of  characters (from the likes of Darth Sidious,Senator Palpatine,Qui Gon Jinn,  to the cowardly and greedy Nute Gunray, ). George Lucas is the Ernest  Hemmingway of film there are no pointless lingering shots (like the space  marine landing sequence in James Cameron's Aliens), everything is short,  sweet and to the point. From the grand battles (reminiscent of Kerosawa) to  the unique way the shots fade in &amp; out of the screen, this is awesome!  People will still be watching these films 20 years from now with the same  amount of love and admiration. George Lucas, I salute you on a job well  done.<br />P.S:GL purposely made this film parallel the structure of the first  SW film.
B00004LN16|4.0|Ok, this is a really good cd but it does have it's let downs, Mainly in the song Hold me back and a little in can't stop rock n roll. I mean they are really repetitive and Hold me Back just never takes off. Also metdown  is just well....not AC/DC.But the strong points on this album are very  strong points. It has a great mix of blues and moments of good hard rock  and really rockin tunes. Such us Stiff upper lip, Houses of Jazz, Safe in  nj city, Satellite blues (one of my fave songs on the album tied with Lip  and All screwed up), Damned, All screwed up and a great finish with Give it  up. So overall this cd is a great rocker but go 4 Razors Edge or if you can  thr Binfire box set for some real AC/DC. This would be a 4 and a half star  but meltdown and hold me back lets it down. But this is still great. If you  are growing a little tierd of AC/DC Try Appitite for destruction the  greatest rock album and band in history GUNS N ROSES Thanks for reading!
B00000ICD9|2.0|A Critic once said that this movie is like walking through sand dunes with led boots.  It's very easy to agree with that.  There are so many plot holes in this movie, I don't know where to begin.  The writers try to cover  up these plot holes with random occurences that we are supposed to believe  just because we are in a fantasy world.  Miracles can be fun, but watching  a magical event, one after another for 2 hours, is ridiculous.  I love  fantasy movies, but this just does fantasy and science fiction all wrong,  and gives it a bad name.  I'm not very religious, but what I notice is that  people who are not religious hate this movie for it's views.  Funny thing  is, most people who are religious hate it even more.<br />This movie is hard  to stomach, the only thing that is worth watching are the absolutely  beautiful computer rendered scenery.<br />Not Reccomended.
B000002MY3|5.0|It had just taken way too long vacation and it came back...for good.<br />The popular mythical axiom: If it sells like hot cake, then it tends to stink ! And some of us have believed this axiom is always as universally true as  the scientific fact that the sun always rises east. In the case of Alanis  Morisette, in contrary to the popular simplistic pseudo-axiom, Jagged  Little Pill proved that GODS of Rock are biased and unfair by the massive  sales volume of more than 10 million copies sold and guess what- It  didn'  t stink EITHER. When you start playing it from the first number onward, you  just simply don' t want it to end, wishing the delicious spin would just go  round and round forever like the Earth keeps revolving endlessly around the  Sun.<br />In-your-face, straightforward, a-kicking, angry female vocals Alanis  ably performed on the album are so strong, energetic and dramatically  powerful that we can hear the earth literally shaking. Boys and girls, my  words of wisdom to you all: you can' t resist  this megawatt sonic  force  named ALANIS- so in my humble opinion the best you can do is giving in to  it and shaking your bon-bons to the force. You oughta know that, eh?
B00004RE0E|5.0|For people who criticized this album, think about what it is you are referring to.  This is legendary recording.  Just because it is 'from the eighties' does not diminish the musicianship and the inspiration and energy  of the music here.  The song &quot;Escape&quot; is phenomenal - it cuts  right to your adrenal glands from the beginning, modulates to soaring  heights, becomes a new song, delivers full power in the chorus.  The songs  of today are so far from that level of musicality, they fall flat on their  faces in the mud before they can even get into the race to compete with  this.  You can criticize they way they dressed and rebel against the  iconoclast mentality if it pleases you, but the fact is an album like this  one is completely untouchable.  When you are out to critique music and you  judge by standards of writing, performance and recording levels, not by the  year of release and hairstyle of the players, this one is A+.  Perhaps  &quot;Sargeant Pepper&quot; and &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; are just  dated psychedelia?
B00000IQBM|5.0|This is probably Jacky's best work, that I've seen anyhow. He'll scare you, that's for sure. The little kid was also surprisingly convincing, and good old Shelley Duvall takes a break from Fairy Tale Theater to join us up  at the Overlook Hotel. &quot;Danny, come play with us!&quot; chant the  girls. Creepy! There's no other way to describe it! I'm shocked I've been  able to sleep lately. &quot;There's no Danny here, Mrs. Torrence...&quot;  Tony? Is that you? You're not hiding in Danny's stomach? (This will all  make sense when you see it, folks.) This is the best horror film I've ever  encountered, so dive in. But don't watch it alone in a dark house. I'm  warning you...
078322608X|5.0|Good Science Fiction (weather a book, a movie, tv, whatever) has the power to make us look at ourselves as a society.  The events in this movie metaphorically mimic events in our everyday lives.  Even though we have not  yet discovered time travel, all of the other events in this movie could  happen, which is absolutely frightening.  This is a dark movie, not for  everyone, which has a deep high-minded script and plot (it may take a few  watchings to fully understand this one.)  The cinematography, directing,  and acting are wonderful.  Bruce Willis proves that he can do other movies  besides his normal action type.  He also proved it later in The 6th Sense,  but I think this is one of his best performences.  As for Brad Pitt, it is  his best performance.  It's so real that by the end, you'll think he's  crazy.<br />Another important thing to note is to buy the DVD, but not the DTS  one.  The non-DTS version has an insightful long documentary on the making  of the film, the DTS version does not have this.  Plus the Dolby Digital  sound is excellent in itself.<br />Most Highly Reccomended.
6301208773|5.0|Die Hard has set the standard for all action movies to date. Alan Rickman plays one of the best villians I have ever seen, cunning and deadly.
6302800420|5.0|Tootsie is one my all time favorite films. It has one of the best actors of all times, Dustin Hoffman playing drag.  I think this is probably his best acting ever.  He is hilarious as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels.  <br />He is playing an out of work actor, a very out of work actor who wants a  job so desperately.  He decides to dress in women's clothes and try to get  a job as a woman.  He does a better job there!  He lands a job on a soap  opera, and his character, Dorothy Michaels is adored by the fans, and one  older doctor on staff, played by Uncle Henry from Punky  Brewster.<br />Dorothy/Michael takes things in stride and soons learns a great  deal about himself and how he is with women.   <br />I recently viewed Tootsie  again.  I had seen it in the movies when it came out at least twice. This  is one of the best comedies of all time.   The screenplay for this movie is  awesome. Hoffman gets some of the best lines ever heard on film. Bill  Murray gets a couple of good lines too.  He was very good in this movie.   Jessica Lange was outstanding, and very deservant of her Best supporting  Actress award.  She was perfect in this film, not a single flaw.  The  acting from everyone was just great.   When &quot;Dorothy&quot; decides to  reveal the real truth on live t.v. is one of the best movie scenes of all  time.  There isn't a scene in this movie I didn't like. This whole movie is  wonderful from start to finish, a truly great comedy that I think everyone  should add to their video collection.
B0000025RI|5.0|What can be said about a monstrous, record-breaking hit almost twenty years after its release?  Not much, except that it still sounds as fresh and funky as it did back in the 80's.  &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Billie  Jean&quot; will forever rank among the best marriages of pop and soul,  standing out not only in Jackson's own career but in overall pop history.   The Gap Band-like &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot; is still  delicious, and if you can get past the corny spoken line in &quot;The Girl  is Mine&quot; (&quot;I told you, Paul, I'm a lover, not a fighter&quot;)  his duet with Paul McCartney is an enjoyable piece of mellow pop.   Throughout the album the smooth production hand of Quincy Jones takes the  music to the highest level possible, and the vocals herein are some of the  most energetic and earnest of Jackson's career.<br />The title track was  always more memorable for its video than its music and lyrics, but non-hit  cuts like &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; and &quot;The Lady in My Life&quot; are  surprisingly strong and are further proof of Jackson's talent, which  unfortunately has been forgotten about in the midst of his strange personal  life.  For those of us who can separate the art from the artist, however,  &quot;Thriller&quot; is a minor miracle: still hip, still modern, and more  than worthy of its title.
B00003W8NM|5.0|If there was an award for DVD's this would win, two discs, great features (Multple angles and audio), great film, but the best thing is packing which is superb. <br />Easily the best DVD I have bought.
0783242808|4.0|It seems as if every generation has at least one memorable defy authority and party hearty movie.  The late nineities teens have this one and it pretty darn amusing as each of these characters has some memorable  character traits about them.  In between all the partying, pranks, and sex,  there are plenty of moments of human emotion and teenage insecurities.  Although alot of teenagers are chasing after sex, they are also indirectly  trying to find attention and who they really are.  I think it succedes on  both counts.
6302914191|5.0|This like the best series, only problem I have never been able to see the whole thing.  I am 24 and when the series was out I was young.  Had I known that this show was around  I would have been totally obsessed.  I have been  trying to catch the re run's on bravo but I missed to much.  But I did see  Fire Walk With Me and I loved it.  There's a little bit of Laura Palmer in  me.  Well if there is any way to buy the whole series I would love to find  out how at any price.
B0000042MY|4.0|This is wonderful music, certainly some of my favorite sounds.  I have two objections, which prevent me from rating the CD five stars.<br />First, not all the music is present.  Music this lovely should not be suddenly cut  off, nor left out of a soundtrack.  &quot;Promentory&quot; and the end  credits, both haunting pieces, should be here.<br />Second, it annoys me no  end that this soundtrack is not in the order in which the music occurs in  the movie.  When this came out on cassette, Jones' pieces were on one side,  Edelman and Clannad on the other.  But this is a CD, not a cassette.  There  is simply no reason, other than perhaps the egos of the two composers or  laziness at the record company, to let this stay so disjointed.<br />As I did  with the cassette version, I will simply use this CD as a master to burn my  own CD, placing the music in the order it occurs in the movie.  Then I can  truly enjoy it.
B000002U82|5.0|enough has been said about the quality of this album. i'm not here to tell you it's good or bad. that's up to the listener. <br />i'd just like to point out that this is the only album by the original band that has no acoustic  guitar on it. <br />it occurred to me that every other pink floyd album has at  least one track with gilmour on acoustic guitar. yet, this is their most  famous album.<br />makes you think, don't it?
6300181456|5.0|I must say, when my mother rented this movie I was less than excited. Little did I realize that this movie was to become an all-time favorite of mine, as well as for the whole family. The music is terrif, and there are  many, many laughs to be had. If you're a silly sort of person, who enjoys  light-hearted comedy/music, this movie is the tops!
6305470464|5.0|I LOVED this movie! It is such a touching, compelling collection of stories. I found the performances utterly believable. I thought noone stood out above anyone else in terms of acting, which is quite unusual in a  movie. If I had to pick out particularly great performances, I would say  Gillian Anderson, Angelina Jolie and Dennis Quaid were the three who stood  out, but that's not to say the others weren't brilliant. I loved the end -  it was totally inexpected. I never expected the characters to link at all  with each other, and it made so much sense when they did! See this if you  want an intelligent, entertaining movie which will make you laugh and cry  from moment to moment.
B000AP04NI|5.0|I loved the musical &#34;Oklahoma&#34; passionately as a youngster.  Then I took it for granted.  Then I forgot about it.  But now seeing it again at age 58, I have rediscovered its magic and vigor.  The Rodgers melodies and the Hammerstein lyrics are as magnificent and infectious as ever.  The skill of their compositions, the dialogue, the staging, acting, singing, etc., etc., make modern Broadway shows look amateurish and unimaginative in comparison.  R and H were geniuses of the musical theater.  In fact, they practically invented this distinctive genre.  However, to fully appreciate &#34;Oklahoma&#34; requires viewers to surrender themselves to the innocence and charm of a bygone era.  But once you do, you will be swept away by Rodgers and Hammerstein's masterful depiction of turn-of-the century Oklahoma.  And you will understand the reason that Rodgers and Hammerstein are rightly acknowledged as two of the finest artists America ever produced.  Successive generations continue to admire and perform their incomparable creations.  I doubt that we shall ever see the quality and longevity of careers as theirs in musicals again.  I am thankful that DVD's, CD's, and MP3's will preserve their work.  Our culture is forever enriched because of R and H's contributions.
0684872153|5.0|Angela's Ashes was a thought provoking emotional roller coaster.  It was a book that I could not put down, and when I had to, I could not wait to get back. At times my husband would feel my sobs in the night and question as  to what made me cry so.  I also laughed out loud some times at work when a  phrase from the book went through my head.  The &quot;excitement&quot; was  one particular phrase. I have not seen the film or have spoken to anyone  who has, but I doubt that it will give as much pleasure as the book because  films rarely do.
6305728437|5.0|I am a very big fan of Walt Disney movies. I just saw this one and I love it! <br />I cried in one scene. Many probably wouldn't but I think the fact that Mulan took on a man's job knowing that it might kill her, was amazing.  Mushu was VERY funny. Every Disney movie has one character who makes us  laugh. This one made me laugh very hard. This is a brilliant movie! See it  and BUY it!
B000002WU9|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I have EVER listened to.  By far the best Wu-Tang solo album.  Though, albums like Ghostface Killah's - Ironman and Ol' Dirty's - Return To The 36 Chambers albums did come close but not  quite.  It's possible that Only Built 4 Cuban Linx is better than Enter The  Wu-Tang, but I don't judge cause there both so amazing that neither will  ever get old.  But if you never heard this CD you have no idea what you're  missing out on.  You have to get it right away.
B000002BE9|3.0|This is NOT AT ALL the kind of music that I typically listen to, but this is some of the best of this genre that I've heard.<br />First of all, her voice is great! Its strong yet she maintains a vulnerability necessary for  the lyrics. Her smooth voice is mature, deep &amp; mellow (especially when  you consider her age...18.) Whether her intention or not, her voice is also  very sexy (you know the kind of voice you wouldn't mind hearing read from  the phonebook!)<br />Most of the lyrics are pretty clever, although she  doesn't cover too much subject matter.  Songs like &quot;Never is a  Promise,&quot; &quot;Shadowboxer,&quot; &amp; &quot;Sleep to Dream&quot;  are well crafted and give pop music a much needed injection of depth.  &quot;Criminal&quot; is just catchy &amp; infectious with a good beat...one  of the best pop songs to come out in years.  At times Apple is over the top  in her approach to lyric writing, but at least its honest (which is much  more than most pop music can claim.)  Her writing is sure to mature with  age (hopefully anyway after her outburst at the MTV awards.)  Towards the  end of the album, the songs are still OK, although a bit more forgettable.   There are 5 or 6 top notch tracks though.<br />Aside from the music, this is a  fantastically laid out package.  The simple layout goes along well with the  music, and the photography is excellent and really conveys something of her  psyche.<br />This is the kind of album that I'll listen to for a while, and  then pass on to the used CD shop, but its pretty good for what it is: pop  music.
0440214041|3.0|This is the first Grisham book I have read and I am in the middle of it.  I find the plot enjoyable, but the writing is stale, the charachters are poorly developed and the description, what little there is, leaves quite a  bit to be desired.  The story line is enjoyable and if this was writen by  someone else with more skill for writiing, I would think it should be a  wonderfull book. I like the aspect of espionage, but find the parts about  the governmet layers boring. When the setting changes and Callahan enters  the plot again, I don't mind reading.  These chapters at least have a few  semi-well developed characters and it is not a whole bunch of boring lawyer  drible.  In fact I rather like Callahan's character, but he plays a bit of  a minor role in the plot so far.  Well I won't bore you any more, you'll  have to make your own call on this one, if you like a strong plot and don't  mind bad writing, you would probably like this book

B00003W8NM|5.0|This is such an awsome movie I really can't understand how thisdeserves any less than 5 stars.  The acting, concept, and just theoverall appearance of the film is done to perfection. It was shot and edited really well.  The only reason I guess someone could rate this so low as I saw someone rating it 2 stars is that they just didn't understand the concept of the film.  And I think some people just dont understand the comedy in this film.  It's supposed to be funny too.  I thought the humor was great.  And the acting of Edward Norton was outstanding.  Along with others like Brad Pitt.  I also guess the reason people would think to rate it so low was they were expecting a totally different type of movie.  It's definitley not straight foward fighting in some club.  It goes so much beyond that.  And I think that's what makes this movie so cool. And this movie was explained so well, they had an explanation for everything that you wondered about so you wouldn't get lost for too long.  Unlike movies such as The Sixth Sense which was praised when they don't explain it very well. How can someone go by for however long it was during the time between when he died and started talking to the boy?  You can't go by a day and not realize if no ones said anything to you let alone how ever long it was; I know it was quite a long time.  And how would his mother set up an appointment with him if she couldn't talk to him, and we know the kid didn't set it up?  I suppose I'm getting off subject I'm just pointing this out because it has always bothered me how a movie with such gaps can be praised like that.  I just think people were too caught up in the moment to think about it.  Anyways, Fight Club is one of the best movies I have ever seen and everyone needs to see it!
B00003CWRX|5.0|Or the Ronnie Reagan of the left.  I mean this in both the positive sense that he is a cultural hero, and in the negative sense that he is a celluloid hero.  I have seen so many Al Pacino movies that I feel not only  that I know him, but that he is actually a character from my own life.  I  like him here as Lowell Bergman, a radical ex-Ramparts Magazine editor  grown into middle age but still fighting the good fight from within the  establishment of CBS and 60 Minutes.  His hair still flies about, showing  that he is a free soul who cares more about substance than appearance.  (We  realize that the dye job is a necessary concession to the media world in  which he lives.)  And the passion still burns bright in his dark eyes, and  he's still as wiry as a teenager.<br />But is this history?  Is this the  truth about what happened with Jeffrey Wigand, big tobacco and CBS?  Or  this \\"revisionist history\\" dressed up dramatically to make the good guys  look good and the bad guys look bad?  I wish I could say this is how big  time journalism really works, and that we have been afforded a true view  inside the system.  But it's hard to tell where the truth leaves off and  dramatic license takes over.  We learned in journalism long ago that there  is no real objectivity; that all is to some extent interpretive.  In fact I  recall a college text we used in the sixties with the (then) arresting  title, \\"Interpretive Journalism.\\"  Today's text might be called \\"Subjective  Journalism\\" and tomorrow's \\"The Age of Tabloid Journalism.\\"<br />Nonetheless, this is a very good movie.  The script by Michael Mann and  Eric Roth sparkles with the immediacy of today's headlines, and Mann's  direction is clean, crisp and dramatically very sharp.  Russell Crowe as  Wigand, the biochemist who blew the whistle on big tobacco and lost his  wife and children to divorce in the process, is excellent.  His subtle and  restrained interpretation of Wigand reminds me so much of those guys from  my generation who opted for the security of the corporate structure, only  in his case the misgivings got to him.  Diane Venova is chilling in a small  role as his wife, a house and home centered woman who leaves him because  she doesn't think it's fair to subject her and the children to the dangers  and financial uncertainties of his whistle-blowing activities.  Wigand is  the reluctant hero and she is the woman who did not stand by her  man.<br />Christopher Plummer does a good job of playing 60 Minutes's Mike  Wallace, who gets plenty of egg on his face here.  He looks pathetic in the  scene where he talks about what he will be remembered for.  I'm sure  Wallace is mad as hell about the portrayal, but I don't think anybody is  going to sue the producers of this movie, since it is so popular and so  much in tune with what most of us believe to be true.  Gina Gershon appears  briefly as a greedy bottom line lawyer who cares nothing about journalism  or the ethics of journalism.<br />John Wayne fought the enemies of our culture  on celluloid with true grit and an unwavering, if sometimes moronic, sense  of what's right.  Al Pacino does the same here, except our enemies have  changed and what's right isn't so clear anymore and the war room has become  the board room.  The really melancholy thing is I guess I wanted to believe  in John Wayne when I was a kid, and now as a middle aged man, I want to  believe in Al Pacino and 60 Minutes.

B00001ZUGJ|5.0|REVIER'S NOTE:  My son wrote the following review and this was done before Amazon had a kid's review form.  Bear in mind this review was written by a 12 year old in a good mood:  <br />All I have to say is.. this movie rocks.. No, not the special effects (But they rock too..) It's the philosiphy of the movie.  People either get this movie, or dont get it.   I get it so much that sometimes I think the world really IS the matrix.  <br />Anyway, the way the story goes is that there's a hacker named Neo who starts to get messages on his computer telling him wierd stuff, which causes him to go to a club and He sees a lady hacker (known as Trinity) who tells him some stuff and about another hacker named Morpheus.  Anyway, Neo asks Morpheus his life long question, &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;  He then learns about the Matrix being a fake world where everone is a slave.  The bad guys in the Matrix are AI's disguised as, get this, Feds! Hehehehehehehe...<br />If this movie was rated on a scale of 0 to 10, it would hit a 72..I love this movie...but..where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you...
B00003W8NM|2.0|I followed this movie obsessively for two years until its release date.  Since I watched Se7en I pictured Fincher to have an absolutely incredible career and as soon as I heard about Fight Club I went out and read the book  and waited forever for the movie to come out.<br />I saw the movie the first  showing and was truly dissapointed.  I did watch it three times because I  was desperate to find all the promise it had but it isn't there.  Yes, it  is very original and definitely has it's moments but it is totally slick  and glossed over.  I was worried it was going to be toned down and would  lose a lot of its power but I didn't think David Fincher would do that.   Well, he did.  <br />The violence is not toned down too much.  I know a lot of  people think this movie is ugly because it has raw violence.  Most movie  present a lot of violence as looking sophisticated when in reality it  generally looks very clumsy and ugly.  The characters and themes of this  film are extremely toned down.  Marla was totally miscast.  In Rogert  Ebert's review, he described Marla as a &quot;hellcat.&quot;  Well, she  isn't supposed to be firey she is supposed to be patheticly miserable and  mopey.  In the book she - along with the other characters - burn themselves  with cigarettes and call themselves &quot;human buttwipe.&quot;  The  omission of these actions create a huge, huge void in the characters and  the ideals and representations of the film.  Another example of this is the  lye scene which was just horribly filmed.  Brad Pitt (who, along with Meat  Loaf were the best cast people in the film) says his lines flatly not only  in this scene but in several scenes as though he is afraid to be truly  honest.  In the book, both characters cry and the narrator pees his pants  because the pain of the burning lye is so extreme.  But of course that  wouldn't be in the movie either because it would be too honest and too  realistic.  <br />There are many other things but just one I have to mention  is the ending which is absolutely PATHETIC!  I sat through the entire  credits all three times I watched it cause I kept thinking that it must be   a joke and the real ending would come on after the credits.  It is  definitely the most pathetic ending I have ever seen.  It does not fit the  film and is absolutely ridiculous.  It is so AWFUL I could just barf.<br />I  will say that some parts of this movie are excellent but the entire film  had the potential to be unbelievably amazing.  The casting hurt it quite a  bit, too.  The main ones are Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.   Although Norton is very talented the fact that his style is so cerebral is  crippling and kind of phony.  And Bonham Carter simply couldn't convey the  true misery and throbbing decay of thinking death is the only way to stop  hurting.<br />Fight Club deals with a lot of issues that are very painful to  realize.  When issues such as these are presented honestly they are more  uncomfortable than entertaining and Fight Club went for entertainment.   This movie could have been absolutely unbelievable if they all would have  had the guts to be honest.
B00004THAY|5.0|I bought this cd the day it came out. The reputations of two of the greatest guitarists of all time were enough to persuade me to buy this album. I listened to it on the way home from work, and didn't find a song I  disliked. The music produced by the unparalleled combination of Eric  Clapton and B.B. King soothes the soul and charms the spirit. I have a  large and extensive collection of music, and this album definitely stands  among the greats. A great pairing, and a great album.
6304080921|5.0|It only takes twelve monkeys, strategically placed throughout the world, to kill five billion people with a mutant virus.  (Actually glass canisters are used.)<br />The central character, James Cole, played with heavyweight  restraint by Bruce Willis, is a convict from the future where the survivors  live underground, leaving the surface to the animals.  He and other  nonconformists live in cages and are made to \\"volunteer\\" to go back in time  to search for the original virus before it mutated in 1996.  Problem is  they keep getting the destination year screwed up.  Once they send him to  1917 and land him naked in the middle of a battle from World War I, where  he gets shot in the leg.  Another time they send him to 1990 where he ends  up in a mental institution and meets attractive co-star Madeleine Stowe,  who plays psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly, leading to an interesting  subplot: shrink falls in love with her mentally disturbed patient.  Brad  Pitt entertains as Jeffrey Goines, a hyperactive nut case, son of a sick  virologist, and leader of an animal rights activist group.  He is  crazy/wise.<br />The film is heavily populated by unfeeling, semi-competent  scientists, mental patients and their caretakers.  There are all sorts of  apocalyptic fools ranting and raving about the end of the world, etc.  Most  of human society as we know it is in shadow, off camera.  There's an  understandable terror of psychoactive drugs among the patients.  Thorazine  in particular is mentioned.  Cole's body is continually being assaulted by  hypodermics, electrodes, the fists and boots of the guards and other hard  objects.  His face is continually smeared with blood.  One gets the idea  that director Terry Gilliam had a bad dream and wanted to  share.<br />Regardless, this brooding, atmospheric yarn is the best cinematic  sci-fi I have seen since Blade Runner (1982); and it is no co-incidence  that it was scripted in part by the gifted David Peoples who helped write  the screen play for Blade Runner.  Never mind that time travel to the past  is an absurdity.  We're forced to rise above that because Gilliam presents  time similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut did in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five  (1969), namely that all time is happening \\"simultaneously\\" and especially  right now, forever.  Notice that when James Cole dies Dr. Railly is not sad  because Cole lives on in the person of his younger self, the child at the  airport watching his death.  This will be the case for eternity.<br />In  typical Gilliam style there are a number of funny bits in the script.  After Cole beats up the pimp to save Dr. Railly, and forces a trade of  teeth (to evade the trackers implanted in his teeth), and the cops come,  the pimp says, all hurt, \\"I was attacked by a coked-up whore and a crazy  dentist.\\"  Another nice touch is to have the virologist father of crazy  visionary Jeffrey Goines sound like a southern politician instead of your  usual mad scientist.  I also liked it when psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly  said, \\"Psychiatry is the latest religion...I'm in trouble.  I'm losing my  faith.\\"  She's right: psychiatry and clinical psychology in general is a  secular religion less than two hundred years old that we as a society ought  to regard with suspicion.<br />In short this is not your usual Bruce Willis  outing.  The action/adventure stuff is secondary to story and character  development and to the social and political statements of the film, the  more important of which is to protest the suppression of the individual by  the larger society.  The forces of evil really are those who dictate what  is normal and those who enforce conformity.  This film is commercially  successful because many of us feel the constraints of society and can  readily identify with Cole's struggle.  What is worse, Thorazine and Prozac  or marijuana and beer?  Anyone who identified even in the slightest with  this film can answer that question.  The second statement is that humans are ruining the planet  and should be killed to save the animals.  This melancholy idea is not so  far-fetched.  That some cult of nuts (or visionaries, as you like) might  someday infect humanity with a deadly virus so that the flora and fauna of  the planet might resume their natural state is at least plausible.ent is that humans are ruining the planet  and should be killed to save the animals.

0440219078|5.0|This one of the most creative books I have ever read.It is pretty  suspenseful and is a very fun book to read. It may be hard to understand at  times, or really hard to understand, but it will all come together in the  end. It may be too hard for someone below 5th grade, unless someone  explains it to them.<br />It is about a boy in a very stange society. He  thinks it's normal but you won't. He gets elected the new receiver of  memories, and has to accept painful, pleasant,fun and disturbing memories  of the &quot;bad times&quot; from the Giver, or the old receiver.( We are  living in &quot;bad times&quot;) Sounds kind of confusing already, doesn't  it?

6302732875|5.0|This movie surely has all the elements of the perfect movie. Excellent actors engaged in excellent, believable acting; superb storyline; fantastic sets and mood; and a well-crafted and laid out plot. Glengarry Glen Ross  has many of my favorite actors in it: Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Ed Harris,  Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, et al. With this cast, it was almost sure to  succeed. But, we've seen films with superb casts that have gone nowhere.  Well, Glengarry Glen Ross goes somewhere; it goes straight into one's  memory bank as a great film worth watching over and over again. I haven't  bought it yet, but definitely intend to. Enjoy this excellent film

I was in my twenties in the 50s and  vacationed in L.A. a lot...I remember the orange groves and the street  cars...and when movie stars were &quot;bigger than life&quot; and this  movie depicts the essence of that time. Can you image hookers being  &quot;cut&quot; to look like Julia Roberts today?  Who would care?  I have  watched this movie at least 30 times. Well, two scenes disturb me..things  that you never see in European films (although I'd like to be proven  wrong)...continuity glitches.  Where did the punch cups go at the beginning  when Dudley and Ed were talking about what department Ed should work in?   Where did Bud's scotch glass go during his first visit with Lynn?  Things  like this drive me nuts..especially in such a great film. I believe Kim  Bassinger DID deserve the Oscar...her lines were delivered perfectly.  So  there!   Im buying a DVD player tomorrow!
B00000JCOV|4.0|Sickly enough, Slipknot's Roadrunner debut moves swiftly as a ferocious beast devouring everything in sight. The first seven tracks, including Frail Limb Nursery have wonderous power, speed, and stealth, but after that  is a major dropoff. All of the tracks between Tattered &amp; Torn and  Scissors are long, boring, and annoying, however Scissors is an epic  thriller. The first track is very disturbing, and then launches into the  killer first &quot;official&quot; song, (sic). Eyeless is my second  favorite song on the disc, with a great percussion intro before going into  a lot of screaming. Wait and Bleed features actual singing by Corey (#8),  but the lack of hard music is a downside. Surfacing comes up next with very  good (unusual) scratches by DJ Sid Wilson (#0), but the lyrical content is  repetative and dull. Spit it Out is next with every instrument perfect.  There are abrupt stops, violent raging starts, and great lyrics to this  masterpiece. Frail Limb Nursery is just horrifing, and Tattered and Torn  begins the dropoff. I think all of the attention that Slipknot is getting  is too much and will make them sellouts like Limp Bizkit. There is some  talented performance both here and live from this Des Moines ninepiece,  though.

The chocolate peanut butter brownies were excellent, and the cream cheese frosted brownies were amazing! (it calls for quite a lot of frosting, and it might be overwhelming to some, but I loved it.)

The over  analysis of the dissassociation of the characters to their world was  interesting, however, also not especially brilliant.  I expected more.  It  was mildly entertaining at best.

Towards the middle of the book, it was a  struggle to finish it because it was going nowhere.  This is just the same  for 'The Partner'.  I have only read 2 of Grishmas's books and it makes me  wonder why his books are always on the bestsellers list.
0446607274|5.0|Some reviewers are bummed out because Bosch has gone soft. I find Bosch to still be the tough and sharp character that he always was. I also think that the dialogue is more plentiful and crisper compared to the earlier  works. What's different are the stories. They aren't serial murders  anymore. Since there is not a murder happening regularly, we get more time  with Bosch. We understand him a little more. We also get to encounter more  of those maddening politics inside the LAPD, city hall, the public mob and  the LA media machine. Those will get you more riled up than the crimes!  Connelly does a stellar job at portraying Bosch fighting to solve cases  while dealing with all the other forces dogging him in the name of  &quot;going along to get along.&quot;
B000000W6F|5.0|There should be a warning label on this album that reads: You will not be able to stop playing this album after starting it.  The Pumpkins have been an obsession of mine for many years and I must say that this album is one  of their best.  The first four Pumpkin albums are immaculate but each have  a different mood.  Gish is the more mellow album.  It sends you into a  trance immediately with the pumping beats of Jimmy's drumming in &quot;I Am  One.&quot;  &quot;Bury Me,&quot; &quot;Rhinoceros,&quot; and  &quot;Snail&quot; can make you totally lose yourself, so watch out!   Billy(and sometimes James) can lull you away with their beautiful lyrics  and often help you through outcast adolescent troubles.  This and their  other albums helped me through many hard times and I'm sure that they have  and can help others as well.  I highly recommend this album for a first  time buy or simply just collection.  Buy this album and buy it now, whether  you are a Pumpkins fan or not, because you more than likely have never  heard any of these songs before.

We were both amazed by the fresh quality of the performances. Redford was  so alive and struggled so hard to love his &quot;K-K-K-Katie&quot;, and  Streisand is practically perfect in her committment to a role about a  fanatic. But the chemistry between them is almost palpable, and I would  highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good - really good -  acting.

B00000ILBK|5.0|Star Trek has long been considered the best and most enduring Sci-Fi series in history, and it appears that it will continue that good reputation. After the Trek movies &quot;Generations&quot; and &quot;First  Contact&quot;, which were ok, but not quite up to earlier standards set by  Star Trek, &quot;Insurrection&quot; is a very pleasant surprise. Unlike the  other movies, which were fairly weak (mostly because of inadequate plot),  this movie proves that Star Trek is still going strong. The story in this  great movie warrant owning it, as you will most likely enjoy seeing it many  times. The appeal of this flick also comes from the mix of Science Fiction  with an almost Fantasy culture, along with great special effects and  acting. If you've ever been a Star Trek fan, or even if you've ever  considered it, this is a movie you must see!
B000025TI2|5.0|Prefab Sprout from Durham, England have a very special sound.  In great parts thanks to Thomas Dolby who produced this album.  The main writer and singer, Paddy McAloon has a very distinct voice that can not be mistaken  after hearing it once.  Musically their style would be the nearest to  Deacon Blue without being a rip-off!  This album in particular is a feast  for the ears.  One would search high and low to find this crystal clear  production on other recordings.  In America the title \\"Steve McQueen\\" was  not allowed by McQueen's daughter, and had to be changed to \\"Two Wheels  Good\\".  My copy is the European one, no bonus tracks. Music for anyone with  a taste for pretty lightweight quality pop and a set of ears made for  details. Happy listening!
B00001ZUGJ|5.0|When something as technologically amazing as The Matrix comes out, what can you do except get on the ride and hang on? I saw this movie a while back, and it was incredible!<br />When you enter this movie, you're introduced  into The Matrix- slowly you begin to grasp the concept of what it really  is. Nothing in this strange, superficial world is what it seems- especially  when it come to keeping the peace. You have two choices: either learn to  use the Matrix for your own side- or die.<br />Everything about the movie was  fairly good, though the real treat is the visual effects, as you've  probably heard by now. The computer graphics are seamless and perfect- they  really add flavor to the movie. Then you can get into the plot itself- a  refreshing look into the paranoid. It's one of those things that really  makes you look at life, even though it's probably in a weirded out,  paranoid way. The acting is good, too, and Keanu Reeves does a great job  with his role. The features included with the DVD are great, too, and I  could just sit, watching the opening screen for a half an hour, at least.  (It's really cool!)<br />This movie is philosophical and deep at times, and  then a few moments later it's full of good guys duking it out with creepy  agent guys. It's sure to become a Sci-Fi classic!
0553278398|5.0|A few years ago, I remembered reading an Asimov (I don't remember which one it was, but it had lots of short stories.)  I was bored, and told my dad if he could recommend a book.  He got me this one, and I thought,  &quot;Cool, I liked the first Asimov I read, I'll love this one.&quot;   This was great!  The whole book leads you into thinking one thing, but  you're totally tricked at the end.     In the first Asimov I had read, he  tricked me a couple times.  But the tricks in this were similar, and I  considered the same possibilities, but didn't truly believe they would be  correct.  He's a really good writer, and my only advice about the book is:   Always keep in mind the three laws of robots (you'll know them if you've  read another Asimov.)  This book is great!      Psychohistory was a really  cool idea.  What if we can predict things like that?
B00003CWRX|5.0|This is a great movie based on a real life insider in the tabbaco industry.The story is great but a times slow.As for the DVD,Disney forces you to sit though almost 10 minutes of previews!If you buy or rent this DVD  ,be forewarned fast forward though the stupid previews!i buy DVD so I do  not have to sit and wait though previews!Only buy if like the movie and  avoid the previews!
B000002UAU|3.0|I'm wasn't born when the Beatles were writing their songs, but I like some of their songs.  It's nice to see a Cd where not all the songs are love songs - I have nothing against love songs, but they get boring if there's  nothing else on the radio.  Anyway, the Cd's good, but not phenomenal.   Abbey Road is better, if you're looking for a Beatles Cd.  But this is the  next best Beatles Cd after Abbey Road, so if someone likes the Beatles (and  they already have Abbey Road), this Cd is a winner.  Otherwise, stick with  Abbey Road.  There aren't that many Beatles songs that are significantly  better than each other, but some Beatles Cd's are better than others.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the best Nirvana album except for In Utero. It has the best song by Nirvana at no. 1. Other amazing tracks include, In Bloom, Come as You Are, Territorial Pissings, Drain You, and Stay Away. This is an awesome CD.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops! I did It Again is one of the best albums that I may have listened before, this album shows that Britney is a singer with a big power to provoke a feeling of strength and sensibility. It's a mix of feelings that  make me feel extraordinary.<br />Oops! I Did It Again is the best selection  for a person who wants to listen the best music at this time.<br />I do like  this CD, I think is the best one in this moment, because the next best will  be the next Britney's album.                       Britney I love  u!
0782008372|2.0|This is a great film - far superior to the unfortunate sequels that followed.<br />The packaging of the film is not too bad, supplementary material is pretty good, including the script and loads of pictures from  the film.<br />Russel Mulchay's audio commentry is informal and relaxed with  some usfull insights into the film.<br />However the transfer is abissmal, the  film quality is extremely grainy - and the disc has far too many digital  artifacts that appear even with the correct contrast and brightness  setup!<br />I haven't checked this out on DTS yet but the dolby digital  encoding is good - the battles sound real the music is bright (possibly a  little to bright for some but not bad).<br />It is hard to believe that this  DVD has the THX seal of approval - it certainly doesn't deserve it!  <br />However for the small ammount of money it now costs it is worth it for  the supplimentary material.<br />However due to the inferior nature of this  particular disc hopefully someone will sort it out and produce a proper  version that does DVD justice!
0822216310|5.0|THIS IS THE AUTHORS FIRST PUBLISHED WORKS AND IS WHAT BROUGHT HIM  HIS SUCCESS.  IT WAS READ ON NPR AND WAS INSTANTELY  A HIT.  THESE 2 PLAYS ARE HILIARIOUS.

B00004THAY|5.0|This is a great CD. A definite buy. Great music by both Clapton and B.B!
630587493X|4.0|The movie is very good, and I enjoy it very much.  Unfortunately, when they put this DVD together they didn't include any deleted scenes.  The movie's theatrical trailer and a short featurette are included.  If you  watch the movie first, then watch the trailer you will be able to see which  scenes got left on the cutting room floor.  Obviously, the movie could have  been much longer, and I understand the need to make it work within a  &quot;reasonable&quot; time, but it is to Chris Columbus' detriment that we  don't get to see what those scenes may have been...

B00003JRCQ|1.0|I watched the earlier version of this movie and was not too pleased with it. Now I have watched this version on DVD and find the actors and progression of the movie to be even duller. Anne looks all the way through  as though she were a bewildered child who had just left an orphanage. I  loved Emma and Sense &amp; Sensibility and was sorely disappointed in this  one.
B00000K3CR|5.0|This Movie touched my heart in More ways then one, I remember when I was a 12-year-old, and sometimes I wish I could have a job like his, testing out toys, just to act 12 again.  After being turned away from a ride because he  was too short, he wishes to a machanical genie to make him &quot;big&quot;.   He thought the genie didn't work and he started to kick it, but when he  woke up the next morning, boy was he wrong.  This movie was always a  favorite and makes me laugh every time I watch it.  It touches the bases of  adult and child issues in a genius way.  Penny Marshal(director) is  brilliant and thinks up some of the funniest material I have ever imagined.   In one scene, the 12-year-old boy(Tom Hanks) was given a baby corn as a  side dish and tried to eat it like real corn on the cobb. I love this movie  and could watch it over and over again.  If you watch it, you will realize  that you could too!
B000002UAR|5.0|The first childhood memory I have of an album is Revolver.  My brothers played it endlessly.<br />It is impossible in the year 2000 to truly appreciate what this album represents.  A person needs to forget every  piece of music they've ever heard, then travel back in time to 1965 and  spend a year listening to popular music ... then sit down in August of 1966  and listen to this album ... and peel yourself off the walls and floor and  ceiling.<br />Rubber Soul laid the groundwork, and Sgt Pepper was a natural  progression ... but Revolver is where the bomb dropped.<br />Michael Stipe of  REM claims the Beatles never had any influence on him ... uh ... right ...  the Beatle's Revolver album is the carrot REM has always chased but never  caught.  This is the album which led to everything else.
B00004U1FC|3.0|This is a good action flick with an 80's cheesy twist.
B000002H33|1.0|I been listenin to Metallica sense I was 4 year old.  I play it whenever I play chicken with parked semi-trucks on World Industry Way in Carmel Mountain Ranch.  It gets me pumped up like Coach Faverty does in the  Autoshop of Poway High School.  They call me Tommy Jr.  Because when me and  Tom Judd get together, things tend to break.  This CD gets me so pumped up  I wanna go fight Josh Shultz and visit Pagan and Maige.  I think some of  these songs are almost as good as the lowrider song by War.  I think it is  worthy to be played over the General's P.A. in the parking lot before  school starts.  General Lee to Shepard, over.  10-4 to the Mothership.  I  swear by Bridgestone tires.  But, if there was anything else I would swear  by, it would have to be Metallica's Master of Puppets.  But, I only gave  them one star because they sued Napster.
B00003Q43A|4.0|How come nobody brought up the fact the aliens use RS232 interface (so is that earth technology or alien technology?) and their computer's CPU recognises Intel instructions? :-) (Maybe they were running Windows - Alien  OEM version? And what, no virus checker? :-D)<br />I went to one of the  preview sessions in Sydney, and at 2 o'clock in the morning, when they  showed one of the alien ships crashed over the Sydney Opera House,  everybody in the audience clapped and cheered.<br />Some sci-fi movies are  just meant to entertain. Forget the social implications and scientific  justifications it made to mankind. This is just a no-brainer film that  takes your mind off your everyday troubles/hassles etc....even when you are  picking holes in the movie..
B000001IPP|5.0|This is by far the best Rancid album ever put out.  Sure, &quot;and Out Came the Wolves&quot; is acclaimed as many's favorite, but &quot;Let's Go&quot; explores the true roots of the band.  This is Rancid.  The band  has a way, especially on this album, to give a unique but catchy melody in  every single song.  There is never a dull moment on this album and I  gaurantee you that you will listen to it straight through.  Tim Armstrong's  voice and Matt Freeman's bass are the stepping stones of what makes the  sound of Rancid so great.  A singer with a craking voice is not always a  bad thing.  Hi Tom.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I loved almost all of the songs on this album. I won't waste your time, so I'll be quick. Buy it!
0843178388|5.0|My favorite of all the Mr. Men books!  I love how Mr. Bump loses job after job because of his stumbling, bumbling nature.  He simply bumps into everything!  I suppose I love him best, because I can relate, being both clumsy and still not knowing &quot;what I want to be when I grow up.&quot;  Can you think of a job he would be suitable for?  He eventually does find  the perfect job, but I won't tell you what it is...
031286504X|2.0|I eagerly anticipated this book and I have to honestly say that I hated it. Nothing ever really happened in the story and the ending seemed imcomplete to me. What a disappointment. If you want to read good vampire  related material, try the Anita Blake series
B00004TH7Z|5.0|All I can say is WOW...what a CD...now that is what a Hard Rock CD is supposed to sound like.  Iron Maiden is back with Bruce Dickenson and Adrian Smith and they sound better than ever.  There are some catchy songs  on here...aka The Wicker Man and my favorite The Mercenary (which I can't  get out of my head).  This CD will make you Bang your Head and break out  the Air Guitar.  This CD rates with some of the best stuff Maiden has ever  done and blows away the past 2 releases with Blaze Bailey at the lead  singer.  If you are a fan of Hard Rock or Iron Maiden..don't miss this!
0780018664|5.0|Although _M_ has without a doubt influenced nearly every psychological thriller that has followed it, Lang's work still stands at the pinnacle as a film that is not only supreme but also vastly distinct from its  descendents. Particularly striking is how the film unfolds: from subtle  visual cues; not a drop of blood is ever shed. It is also redemming that  the film is able to evoke symphathy for Lorre's child-murderer without  heroicizing and glamourizing crime. It takes a master like Lang to direct a  cohesive film based on specific human interactions rather than vague  sociological themes.
0375707972|2.0|&quot;The Reader&quot; was a partially interesting book.  I appreciated the spare prose, but it fell slack too often (many &quot;I don't remember&quot; phrases) and weakened the novel.  Examples of spare prose  that sustain tension throughout the story are &quot;The Retreat&quot; by  Aharon Appelfeld (deals with the beginnings of the Holocaust) and &quot;The  Liar&quot; by Martin Hansen (different subject matter, but a &quot;dark  secret&quot; theme).<br />The early relationship between the boy and Hannah  was the best part of the book.  If the rest of the story had been as  detailed and taut, the impact would have been much stronger.  Instead, the  obviousness of the secret and the glosses over key events blurred other  sections.<br />I did like the ending's restraint; neat explanations or happy  endings would have completely belied all that came before.
0767824571|5.0|This is definetly one of the best comedic movies. with 3 headed knights to politic peasants to witches and enchanters and killer bunnies if you like to laugh you shouid definetly buy this movie
B00000J2L7|5.0|man, this movie truly is the bomb. i saw it for the first time at a friend's the day after stanley kubrick passed away. i found it funny, but a little overwrought. then i watched it again alone, then watched it some  more, and this is one of the best flicks around. it's got drama, the  autocratic behavior of the government, man's obsession with machines and  its consequences, sexual innuendo, and of course, crazy humor. sellers and  everyone else rule, and stanley gave the film an eerie, ironic feel that  stays with you. a must see.
B00004T9UF|4.0|There are few songs that are just WACK. Out of the 18 tracks here, I like about 12 of them. This is MUCH better than his first album, in my opinion. The lyrics are incredibly funny. However, after the funny lyrics, he has  little substance, and he doesnt have too many songs with deep poignant  meaning. Still, if you want to be entertained with twisted as scenerios and  thumpin beats, pick up this album.....
0375707972|5.0|Being in my end 20s and German at the same time I found this book a very valuable and new approach to the Holocaust history. It reflects emotions and feelings of our young German generation that is still struggeling with  the history of their parents/grandparents. Schlink is able to look at the  history from a different angle with a modern approach, bringing together  the young generation that is not to blame with the generation that is to be  hold responsible. Presenting those two generations in a couple of lovers  and adding an age difference of the &quot;other&quot; way (the man being  much younger than the women) makes this book remarkable, rich in diversity  and definetly worth reading.
B00004T9UF|2.0|I'm sorry,  I picked up this album the other day because I so much enjoyed &quot;the real slim shady&quot;.  After I heard the song &quot;Kim&quot; I had nightmares. Even now I cannot understand why this song was written, why  people think it's a good song and why people aren't as mortified as I am.  ... I am very disturbed that a song like this is on one of the  best selling albums of the year.ility to compile and deliver  such a torrent of words with such speed, precision, inflection, and  meaning.  The only bad track on the disc is #3, &quot;Stan,&quot; but maybe  it will grow on me in time.  &quot;Kim&quot; is, as MTV's Kurt Loder said,  &quot;the most disturbing thing I've ever heard,&quot; but it makes me glad  that Eminem gets this stuff out in the studio, instead of in real life.   His wife must be one cool lady to be able to separate her husband from his  various alter egos.  Keep it up, you two.
B000022TSF|5.0|I am convinced that the 3 or 4 people who complained about the ending just didn't understand it (one person even said that the movie didn't take place in Chinatown! ).<br />OK, here it is. The reason Chinatown is universally  regarded as a classic and why it won the Oscar for best screenplay is the  way the Chinatown theme runs throughout the plot as a metaphor for Giddes's  past life. He tells us that Chinatown was a place he worked as cop where  the job was to &quot;do as little as possible&quot; where &quot;you never  knew what was going on&quot; and where he had tried to help a woman but had  only ended up hurting her.<br />At the end when Evelyn has been  killed--despite jake's efforts to save her--and when Jake realizes that the  police are going to ignore Cross's crimes, Jake whispers (barely audible)  &quot;as little as possible&quot; and then his partner says &quot;Come on  Jake, it's Chinatown.&quot;<br />The ending ties up everything that has  happened in the rest of the film, and, by extension, in Jake's life.<br />As  Movieline's Top 100 film site says: &quot;The best thing Jack Nicholson  will ever do. The best thing Faye Dunaway will ever do. The best thing  Roman Polanski will ever do. The best thing Robert Towne will ever do.  Etc.&quot;
B000000WA4|5.0|This is a great collection of all the Smashing Pumpkins have to offer. From the hard hitting &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot; to the soft and solumn &quot;Farewell and Goodnight.&quot;  If you like some of what  the Pumpkins do, you should own this dual-album to get a taste of their  unbelievable range.
B00003W8NM|5.0|What an incredible story. This is NOT a film that glorifies violence. This is NOT a testament to anarchy or facism. This is a beautifully constructed piece of art that hammers against your senses from start to finish!<br />David  Fincher has an excellent track record with Alien 3 and Se7en and you can  almost taste the darkness he brings to this story. Is it about a man's fall  into insanity or his painful path towards becoming his true self? Is he the  dichotomy in all of us or is this just a great visceral movie?<br />You must  see this and then decide for yourself (and then argue with all your  mates).<br />The first rule of this movie is, if you are going to have  fighting, make it look like it hurts. The second rule of this movie is if  you are going to have actors, pick Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. This is the  best I have seen both of them. Brad shines like a light as the muscular,  taut alter-ego and Norton gives the whole spectrum of a man going out of  his mind to seek solace.<br />Rule three is if you are going to make a DVD,  package it likes this one.<br />Like the fact that this is no ordinary movie,  this is no ordinary DVD. It is wonderfully packaged and you actually get  two discs. (Disc two contains outtakes, behind the scenes stuff publicity  and more than I have seen on any other DVD.<br />The final rule of this movie  is that if you are going to make a movie, make it one that shakes everyone  up and gets them arguing amongst themselves.

0782008372|1.0|Do yourself a favor and stick with the VHS version, they did such an awful job with the sound, that if you have a 5.1 setup, you will be very disappointed.  I was constantly having to increase the volume to hear the  vocals during quiet scenes, and lowering the volume whenever the music  kicked in.  It was very annoying.  The video is barely better than VHS.  I  was wondering why this was priced lower than most DVD's, it's not close to  being a DVD.
0783224338|3.0|The special effects are excellent, but the movie is, like many disaster movies, very predictable, but if you feel like just sitting back and watching an entertaining film, this is one you shoudn't miss.  One of this  films main attractions is its stars, James Bonds Pierce Brosnan And T2's  Linda Hamilton, both of who's performance is quite good. Overall enjoyable,  but not something you could watch over &amp; over again.
B00001PE4D|5.0|BETTER THEN THE ORIGINAL.  SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR IS WONDERFUL.  I MUST ALSO SAY THAT SHE LOOKS EXTRODINARY WITH BROWN HAIR.  <br />THE MOVIE IS SIMILAR TO THE 1980'S MOVIE DANGEROUS LIASIONS EXCEPT FOR THE TIME AND THE  STARS.<br />SEBASTION VALMONT AND HIS HALF SISTER CATHERINE ARE TWO VERY RICH  AND SPOILT BRATS.  THEY ARE LIVING IN THERE MANHATTERN APARTMENT WHILST ON  SCHOOL HOLIDAYS.  THERE PARENTS ARE AWAY ON HOLIDAY.<br />AND AS YOU DO, THEY  MAKE A BET ON THE VIRGINITY ON THEIR SCHOOL HEADMASTERS DAUGHTER - PLAYED  BY REECE WITHERSPOON.<br />I REALLY MUST SAYTHAT THE OVERALL MOVIE IS GREAT.  RYAN, REESE AND ESPECIALLY SARAH ARE FANTASTIC IN THEIR ROLE.<br />WATCH OU  FOR THE END SCENE WITH THE SONG &quot;BITTER SWEET SYPHONY&quot;.  ALWAYS  GOOD TO SEE THE NASTY PEOPLE GET WHAT HEY DESERVE.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is an awesome movie.  The movie isn't the best part.  If you get the DVD, you can access a whole bunch of other stuff which is all cool!
6303979882|5.0|This movie is the greatest.  My friends and I all relate to at least one of the four girls.  This movie is realistic, and the actresses- no matter what the cynical editors write- portray their parts very well.  Now and  Then has been my favorite movies for several years.  It shows the troubles  that teenage girls have to cope with, and adds a little extra twist with  the Dear Johnny murder.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes an  emotional movie with some humor sprinkled in.
0784011176|2.0|I enjoyed Campion's effective imagery, which was often striking, and the performances, but the central theme of this film - A Woman Finding Her Voice In The Male Dominated Society - is nothing but Oprah-style feminist  psychobabble.<br />Enjoy the imagery, but take the message with a grain of  salt.
0767805534|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. The sequal is being made by Miracle Entertainment (mvee). Look for it next year.
B00000K19E|4.0|Unlike most sci-fi action films of recent years, where the emphasis seems to be on how well things get &quot;blowed up&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; has a brain and knows how to use it. It succeeds on almost every  level.<br />Most prominently, &quot;The Matrix&quot; succeeds in showing us  violence and action in new and previously unimagined ways.<br />Case in point:  the hyperkinetic action sequences seek not only to thrill, but also to bend  the mind, to introduce new possibilities. We all know that Keanu Reeves'  character, Neo, dodges bullets. But in a standard action film, he'd have  run away from them, or jumped off the roof. <br />Not in &quot;The  Matrix&quot;. <br />Instead, we get a visionary, mind-bending scene in which  we SEE Neo dodging the bullets in sweeping, amazing slow motion.<br />Ditto  for the &quot;lobby&quot; scene, which is nothing less than a ballet of  violence, using Neo's and Trinity's ability to &quot;warp&quot; the Matrix  as a backdrop.<br />Amazing stuff.<br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; looks and feels  like nothing else ever made. Even the green-tinted scenes in the the  corporate &quot;matrix&quot; fantasy world that Neo's doppleganger Thomas  Anderson inhabits are so stifling and antiseptic that they're almost  menacing.<br />And let's not forget that the premise that &quot;The  Matrix&quot; is based on - a world in which humans are unwittingly enslaved  to serve their machine masters - IS the most imaginative sci-fi premise in  years. It builds on current technologies - virtual reality, artificial  intelligence, solar power and a host of others - and seems entirely  plausible.<br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; also has an enviable human element,  with Carrie-Anne Moss finding a great mix of toughness and vulnerability as  Trinity. Laurence Fishburne does excellent work as the enigmatic Morpheus,  though I found myself wishing we could spend less time on Morpheus'  Zen-teacher musings and more on his character. And Hugo Weaving is  beautifully understated as Agent Smith. Keanu Reeves' Neo/Thomas Anderson  is wooden, as you'd expect from him, but he does display moments of depth  along with the invariable &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; flashbacks.<br />If  &quot;The Matrix&quot; has a flaw, it's an ending that's a little too pat  and seems more focus-group driven (not to mention sequel groundwork-driven)  than a real extension of the story. Otherwise, it's a masterpiece of action  and science fiction.<br />And it really DOES show you just how deep the rabbit  hole goes.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|OH MY GOD!   I have waited for this album since my senior year in high school (1993 -- Fear of the Dark time).  The &quot;Air Raid Siren&quot; (Bruce Dickinson) is back, as is Adrian Smith, and the band now has THREE  guitarists.  But don't think the playing gets muddled -- these guys play  off each other beautifully and give some great sonic treats in the way of  extremely diverse soloing styles.  The songwriting is solid, and the  classic Maiden &quot;epic&quot; elements are there -- just check out  &quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot; and you'll see what I mean.  There are  some great head-bangers too like &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; and &quot;The  Mercenary&quot;.  Bottom line -- this is what we all wanted from the band;  get it and you won't be disappointed.  Thank you Iron Maiden.
B00000JGOH|3.0|There's much to recommend this charming film - the wonderful performances, the period sets and costumes, and of course, the Bard himself.<br />But how film beat out &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; for the Oscar is absolutely  beyond me.<br />Actually, I DO know...this is the same Academy that picked  &quot;Oliver&quot; over &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Forrest  Gump&quot; over &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;  over &quot;GoodFellas&quot;, &quot;Ordinary People&quot; over &quot;Raging  Bull&quot;, and so on and so on....<br />The Academy likes historical epics,  and this one was no exception.<br />So enjoy this film...but the REAL best  picture of that year was &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.
6302413931|5.0|When I learned what Francis Ford Coppola had gone through to make this picture, I think I had appreciated it more than ever.My only regret is that I never saw this one on the big screen. This is a picture that includes  epic scenes filmed on the grandest scale possible(Helo attack with Wagner  blarring, for example) and scenes in which are so quiet and contemplative  you wonder if this was not just some elongated music video.This is not a  plot driven movie.This is an adventure of visual and auditory imagery that  tells its own plot.You go on the journey up the Mekong Delta with the  crewmembers of the plastic patrol boat.The soundcrew and cinematography  crew won well-deserved oscars.The new widescreen special edition is even  better.(Film has been remastered and must be viewed with surround to  appreciate!) Use of The Doors in opening and ending scenes probably  introduced a new generation to the genius of Jim Morrison as well!This is a  brilliant piece of cinema and was well worth what Coppola went through to  get it off the ground!
630575067X|3.0|Let's face it: if you were looking for snappy dialogue (well, at least CONSISTENTLY snappy dialogue), deep characterizations and profundity from the first three Star Wars films, you were going to go away disappointed.  Ingmar Bergman films they weren't.<br />Star Wars was always meant as  high-octane, visually inventive eye candy whose job was to thrill,  entertain, and put you squarely in another universe, and &quot;The Phantom  Menace&quot; does no less. <br />With the caliber of actors who worked on the  movie, it could have been far more character-driven, but the film still  works as grand entertainment and a sturdy foundation to the new Star Wars  series.<br />&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; has scenes and set pieces that are  so lush, so beautifully conceived and constructed, that you literally ARE  transported to another world. The entire Naboo city, for example, is  absolutely fabulous - Venice set in another galaxy. Tatooine, though we've  been there before, is shown in much greater detail as a place where people  literally live in co-existence with a desert. The Gungan city is also  extraordinary, and gives us a sense that there's a serious intelligence  behind the laconic Gungans that later serves as an important plot  device.<br />The action sequences in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; are also  beautifully conceived and executed, particularly the podrace sequence,  which is absolutely thrilling. The various lightsaber battles are done  convincingly, and the battle on Naboo between the Gungans and the battle  droids - conceived almost entirely on computer - has true epic sweep.<br />So  if &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; succeeds grandly as entertainment, why  only three stars? This is because its human factor - actors and characters  - fails it. <br />Right off the bat, the character of Anakin deserved a better  actor than Jake Lloyd. He's a cute kid, and displays some pluck, but he's  utterly unconvincing when it comes to scenes requiring emotional depth.Other young kids have given their characters great depth and believability  (witness Haley Joel Osment in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;), and with Lucas'  unlimited budget and resources, it's surprising he made such a poor choice  to play Anakin.<br />By the end of the film, I had no idea whatsoever how this  kid could grow up to be Darth Vader. Perhaps that's Lucas' intent (it does  provide a powerful incentive to see &quot;Episode 2&quot;), but it was  extremely unsatisfying dramatically.<br />With the acting talent on display  here - Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, for starters - George Lucas could  have made this film far deeper character-wise, but he didn't. It seems  those big names were chosen for their names, not for what they could do in  character. Even Samuel L. Jackson, who rarely seems to blend into anything,  seems bemused and bored in this film.<br />Acting woes aside, &quot;The  Phantom Menace&quot; does succeed grandly as entertainment and spectacle,  and is very much worth seeing.<br />Oh, and yes...I LIKED Jar-Jar.
6301543408|4.0|There is nothing like a Trek big screen film that begins with a prologue.(Trivia:There was an original prologue that was cut from Generations where we see Kirk skkydiving, and then being informed of the  christening of the latest Enterprise!)Laurence Luckinbull is fun to watch  as Spock half-brother.People complain about the effects of this film.I  don't see the problem with them.They serve the film as the effects in any  Trek flick would!      This film is fun, mainly, because there are a lot of  scenes involving the trio(you know who I mean too!)Scene where Nichols  sings is outstanding(that is a thrill back to the series when she did that  on occasion-remember Charlie X episode).This film caught a lot of flack,  but it is just as fun to watch as Wrath of Khan if you ask me.
0453007686|5.0|This was a great way of approaching the oft-heard story of the Three Little Pigs.  Through fanciful illustrations and strong voice (the voice of the Wolf, of course) we hear the &quot;true&quot; version of what really  happened to the pigs.

B000002LMM|5.0|Never have I listened to a soundtrack that has touched the soul as this one.  It puts me in a whole different atmosphere than that of my own surrounding world.  Definitely worth the purchase.
0060977493|4.0|I read this book during a flight delay; It was the first time that I didn't mind sitting for hours at the airport. I consumed this book like a delicious dessert; Towards the end I slowed down my reading even more  hoping to prolong the experience. English is not my first language and I  have no expectation of how the English language should be used. I only know  that the author's play of words did not frustrated me. I liked the way that  tragedy and joy were treated the equally and how nothing was spelled out in  obvious terms. It was less of the plots or characters but rather the  storytelling itself that cativated me. The only other books that I had ever  enjoyed this much were written by Herman Hesse; Not to say that they are at  all alike. It could have just been me and my mood at the time of reading.  After all, this is just another book-shape hole in the universe.
0783229569|5.0|&quot;Ferris Buehler's Day Off&quot; for the drug set, this is the best, and most wickedly funny,            movie I know about perception under the influence of psychedelic drugs. Fear &amp;            Loathing remains true  to Hunter Thompson's story, for even as it celebrates the             absurdity of life as seen 'with a head full of acid,' Gilliam/Depp/Del  Toro's film is            unafraid to reveal the most unsettling aspects of  the drug journey, many of which lend            the film its most indelible  moments. This is one of those rare movies which is better for the             living room than the cinema, because somehow you've got to keep up with  the guys            onscreen.
B00004R7TP|5.0|Although i've probably heard this album a little too many times there's no denying that it is a true classic and one of kate's best. The extra tracks here are pretty decent -<br />'The Big Sky Meteorogical Mix' is fun with  Youth's funky bass playing brought right up in the mix 'Running up that  Hill 12&quot; Version' is basically a pretty typical eighties style  12&quot; remix complete with generous use of delay. 'Be Kind to my  Mistakes' - is a really touching track about how people can live and love  together even with the darkest of secrets. 'Under the Ivy' - another  touching track that nearly has kate choking all over her piano - it seems  to deal with finding a place of calm and reflection for oneself when all  gets too much. 'Burning Bridge' is perhaps the weakest of the extra tracks  but is still pretty strong with some nice kate style chanting and upbeat  melody in the chorus. 'My Lagan Love' is just kate with a ton of lush  reverb singing in a traditional irish style a tragic love song - very  nice!<br />For more info on &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; itself see the reviews  on Amazon for the CD without the extra tracks.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I like his stuff.  He has very creative rhymes, and an original style.  However, I don't like it when musical artist sing about other famous people. Ok, so you know Dr. Dre, Fred Durst, Carson Daily, Christina  Aguilera and every other person in the world.  Bid deal.  His songs are not  very deep either.  But I still like em for some twisted reason.  Sadistic I  guess.
B0000241WA|4.0|There's a real synergy when these two get together on this album--the Texas freelancer Olson and the ex-Byrd Clark (who I think has since passed on...). Olson's own band, the Textones, have never really been very interesting--in material or in sound, and Clark has not really made a name for himself as a solo artist. Together, though, they create some real moments in the studio. Excellent, understated production and simpatico ensemble playing from the band assembled for this project all contribute to a real sleeper of an album. Clark's lonesome wavering vocals on \\"Del Gato\\", with the reverb-laden acoustic underpinnings, are worth the price of admission alone. Olson's voice, which is historically a real hit or miss proposition, more often hits on this album--especially on the harmonies. A nice vibe is also created on an old Woody Guthrie ballad. Good album. Check it out, and surprise your friends with it. This is the kind of recording that goes out of print, never to be seen again.<br />ps. Olson seems to be at her best in these collaborations. Check out her live album with Mick Taylor (ex-Rolling Stones), especially their stone-killer version of \\"Sway\\" off Sticky Fingers.
079283321X|5.0|This 1976 classic stars Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa in his story about a club fighter with 56 fights. He never mentions how many losses (probably many) however he does say he never got his nose broke. He is a  street tough with a good heart and bad luck and makes his real money as an  enforcer for the mob. His good heart gets him a stern but polite repremand  from his boss because he refused to break someones thumb. He meets Adrian  (Talia Shire) a pet shop clerk with low self esteem as he shops for his  pets. Talia Shire is almost comical but loveable as an overly shy and  homely 30 year old. Rocky sees her pretty face through her short hair, old  lady glasses and garb. When she asks Rocky why he wants to fight his  humorous replies go from, &quot;You have got to be a moron if you want to  be a fighter&quot;, to &quot;Because I can't sing or dance.&quot; Balboa  may sound dumb but his character alleges otherwise. In comes The  Bicentennal fight in which Hevyweight champ Apollo Creed calls on Rocky to  be his opponent because his scheduled contender has gone south. True this  is a farytale story because you have to believe while the champs record is  34 and 0 Rocky's is more like 30 and 26. Rocky however is Italian, Columbus  discovered America and it's 1976 the Bicentennial. This bout was meant as  an entertaining farce in where the champ gives some unknown a chance and  easily whips him. Rocky works out for this bash like it's do or die and  proves to Creed winning is not the only way to be tough!
B00004THAY|5.0|This review is not going to say anything different than the rest. This is the best musical collection to come from either one of these artists in a long time. It should really be no surprise when you couple the King with  the one that was dubbed a god back in the seventies. What would you expect?  Then they went and backed themselves up with a line of Mr. Clapton's best  compadres. The like of Andy Fair Weather Low and Nathan East from the  &quot;Unplugged&quot; grammy award winning days along with some sexy vocals  in the background from great female voices belonging to Shannon and  Wendy...well...thank you all...God Bless you for finding your way out of  the &quot;Pilgrim&quot; pop swamp and welcome home...it is good to see you  made it back....the sounds are wonderful.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I think this CD is really good, i love Eminem and its one of the 5 Rap CDs i have. I'm usually more of a rock/punk/ska fan like blink ect.... but i really enjoy eminem i LOVE the track &quot;Rock Botton&quot;  off of his  first CD and i LOVE &quot;Stan&quot; off of this one. i like them beacuse  it shows that not all rappers rap about chicks and guns and stuff. I think  &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; makes a really good point and even my mom likes it  (and she doesnt exactly LOVE rap) and &quot;stan&quot; is good just cuz it  shows the singers opinion/side of the whole &quot;obbsession&quot; deal, to  let the fans know how the singer feels about the way the fan acts, i mean  come on if this is how Em feels think how the members of the boy bands must  feel with the 11 yr old stlkers!
B00003CXB7|5.0|But then it probably isn't fair to be comparing the movie tothe TV show, since both have their own merits on their owngrounds.<br />&quot;MASH&quot; the movie is indeed a stirring look at the insanities of war and the resulting humor. Skerrit, Sutherland and Gould yuck it up as ne'er-take-seriously surgeons, and Robert Duvall is great as stiff religious Major Burns, a real jerk of a guy. Plus, Sally Kellerman is a hottie. The &quot;Suicide is Painless&quot; scene is eerie.<br />For those expecting the TV sitcom, the movie will appear to be completely different.  But watching the scene where Burns and Houlihan go at it, and the boys slip a microphone into their tent, you're know these are the same characters you've always loved- they just look a little different.<br />And if you squint, Donald Sutherland kind of looks like Alan Alda.

0446525537|5.0|Nicholas delivered the goods!  As his prologue stated, he indeed made me smile and made me cry.  His characters are believable and the picture he painted of Beaufort, North Carolina showed me it's a place I would love to  visit.<br />The story flashs back to the 50's when Landon is seventeen.  His  father, a Congressman, was rarely around.  He unwittingly drives Landon to  enroll in a drama class, in which Jamie Sullivan is also in--so that he can  bring his grade point average up, thinking it would be an easy  &quot;A&quot;.  The turn of events causes his and Jamie's paths to collide.   For one, if it hadn't been for that and the fact that he became class  president at his father's insistence, he wouldn't have ended up asking her  for a date to the homecoming dance.<br />Jamie, although sweet and always  doing good things for others, was viewed by her peers as a nerd.  She  always carried her bible around and wore the same doudy clothes.  And not  only that, she was the preachers daughter.  Therefore, since Landon's  football playing friends were the studs of the school, wouldn't be caught  dead with her... they'd made fun of both her and her father after all,  hidden behind trees when they were younger.  And they were still on the  rebellious side.  But then, he'd needed a date and there was no one else to  ask.<br />Landon is unnerved when he's around Jamie, never sure of how he  feels about her and trying not to like her.  But then he owes her a favor  and he's stuck being in a play he doesn' want to be in.  But the night when  she comes out on stage dressed as an angel--changes everything.  He's  hoplessly in love.<br />Jamie's secret floors Landon and will leave you teary  over their dilemma and will capture your heart.  This book is a must read,  but have tissue handy!
B00000K3UU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie much more than I had expected to.  Big Daddy is a very entertaining (cute AND funny) film.  In my opinion, it's more of a rent than a buy, but nontheless, it was very good.
B00000K3UR|1.0|So many critics have called Adam Sandler's work subpar, and I couldn't agree more.  His only joke is that funny voice he makes; just watch him--in every single movie, CD, and SNL skit he has done, he does that pathetic  excuse for a funny accent.  It has worn thin, and so have his movies.   &quot;Big Daddy&quot; is disturbingly irresponsible.  Critics that call his  character &quot;a good father in his own way&quot; must not have seen the  movie I saw.  Adam Sandler crosses a line and does not make light of it or  even acknowledge it, whereas good comedies like &quot;There's Something  About Mary&quot; recognize that they have crossed the line, but set the  tone correctly as to make the audience feel good about laughing.  Laughing  at &quot;Big Daddy&quot; just doesn't feel right.  To see a movie that  finds humor in the more disturbing things in life, rent  &quot;Happiness&quot;.  It's an example of how to set the right tone.
B00000G3PA|4.0|If you have not yet seen this movie, please ignore the negative reviews.  See it for yourself and decide.  This movie has incredible special effects, and very believable actors.  I would have given it 5-Stars, but I reserve  those ratings for movies such as &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;The  Insider&quot;, etc.<br />Still, Armageddon is an excellent apocolyptic  thriller.

B00003CWQ2|4.0|It's a manifesto of facist overthrow! It's a battle cry against complacent consumerism! It's an indulgent work of beautifully shot violence! It's a work showing great promise and brilliance with a cop-out ending! It's a  floor wax! It's a breakfast cereal! Just scan through a few of the reviews  and you'll see these and many other opinions and interpretations of this  movie, all of them strong in their conviction that they are right. Some of  the greatest works of art inspire this sort of reaction.<br />I am willing to  weigh in on the side of this being a great work. I found it captivating,  inspiring, and chock full of personal significance. For me it was a movie  about beating complacency and finding how you are most alive, not sweating  irrelevancies and getting to the heart of what you find fulfilling. It  makes a case for breaking free of what could be called a &quot;comfort  zone&quot; and scraping off the barnacles of a meaningless existence. It  did not promote total revolution, nihilism, or anarchy, but did speak to me  to encourage focus and &quot;letting slide that which does not truly  matter.&quot; I found personal significance because I had been letting my  life get pointless for the past few years, aimlessly stagnating in a dumb  office job and going through a series of predictably limited relationships.  My latest girlfriend had been getting on my case to clear out my room and  get a better job. So my next gig was with a show that toured for three  months, and while on the road I saw this. Meanwhile, she moved into my  building and then broke up with me and soon was dating one of my roomates.  This really helped me relate to the message that no one's just gonna give  you something, you gotta do something yourself. Live to the fullest. I  contemplated this as I lived a life of &quot;single-serving&quot; homes (a  different motel every night) and sought meaning in a life where my love had  left me for a so-called friend.<br />To me, the story was about someone who  had fallen into an unsatisfyingly complacent existence and then discovered  something new that intrigued him. When his old life is irreparably  shattered, he turns to that intriguing new thing and finds that it empowers  him to take what he wants, even if he doesn't realize it. Of course there  are many levels to this, and many interpretations, but this is what it said  to me.<br />I didn't get an urge to tear down society, but the movie did give  me a look at living life more fully and going for what you deserve,  whatever it is.ut someone who  had fallen into an unsatisfyingly complacent existence and then discovered  something new that intrigued him.

It does &quot;bare all,&quot; but I certainly don't think that it's  a bad thing. Alanis has always been a very honest artist, and this displays  her at her best. Princes' Familiar is a wonderful song; it's unlike  anything else I'd heard from her, and I have to say that if this is the  direction she's taking her music, I'll be buying her CDs for a long time to  come...

6304169558|2.0|This movie a couple of years ago was the first one that set the path for BIG NATURE CATASTROPHY movies with DARN EXPENSIVE special effects and MINIMAL common sense and TEPID actor performances. The visual effects send  shivers down your spine, but unfortunately they make up only max. 30  minutes of the movie, so meanwhile you can take a nap, because sluggish  romance between main characters is not persuasive, but there is nothing  else in the movie, besides counting scenes that in real life would have  killed our heroes: Well, if you don't know that NOTHING can survive after  being crushed into the core of a tornado (yes, even if Ms. Hunt clutches  the buttress of a bridge VERY TIGHTLY), you should watch CNN or DISCOVERY  channel more often. From the point of view of true-to-life movie,  &quot;Volcanoe&quot; was much better..
6302648750|5.0|This movie is a trip; very funny and entertaining with Oscar Award-Winning Special Effects, it is a must see!  If you really like outrageous comedy go ahead and buy it!  Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn play the perfect enemies  who end up making up (or do they?); then discover they are stuck with each  other for eternity!  Amidst all of this zaniness comes a paradox-- it  actually makes you think of your own eternal alternatives more  seriously!<br />The entire movie is great, but a definite overuse of  lightning.  Bruce Willis is in his element in comedies and does a great  job. Isabella Rossellini gives a incredible performance as well; but Meryl  and Goldie steal the show.<br />If you are looking for something unique,  off-the-wall, entertaining, and want a good laugh, then this is the movie  for you.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone; however, if you are a  Streep or Hawn fan, this is a must buy!<br />One more thing, the ending is one  of the best I've ever seen in a comedy! 5 stars all around!
B00004THAY|5.0|It's a rare treat when two of the best collaborate. There is little debate the EC is one of the fastest and cleanest guitar players around. Also, there is little debate that BBKing is at the apex of blues guitarist. He  has many prodigies, but it's tough to take away from a master who's done so  much for so long.<br />Now, these two combine in a ripping, soulful, engaging  collection that is as amazing for the vocals (the voices are unmistakeable,  even for someone without the jewelbox)as it is for the guitar  riffs.<br />Great addition to any collection, with a mix of fast and slow, new  and old.<br />It's just about magical.  Enjoy.

B00004THAY|5.0|B.B. and Eric or Mentor and Student have finally recorded a full album. It sounds too good to be true. But it is. The recording quality is very &quot;in-your-face&quot;. It actually sounds like those two are in your  living room jamming. The added plus of Doyle Bramhall II, Steve Gadd,  Nathan East and Andy Fairweather-Low makes this album so special. I knew  &quot;Marry You&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be&quot; from Bramhall's  album-Jellycream. So, I knew what great funky/bluesy songs they were. The  acoustic versions of &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot; and &quot;Key to the  Highway&quot; have a tendency to send shivers up my spine just because of  its acoustic intimacy. Then you round up the album with a great cover of  Sam &amp; Dave's &quot;Hold On, I'm comin'&quot; and it makes for a great  album for guitar fans, blues fans and fans of the two blues masters.
B00000G3Q4|3.0|Now don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Sam Raimi (especially his DarkMan), but this movie didn't seem to cut it.  I think a good, quality horror movie must always begin with a lot of charactor developement, in  which the audience can relate to the &quot;victims&quot;.  This way, when  trouble arrives, the siduation becomes more believable.  This was not so in  Evil Dead.  The movie almost emmediately started with a set of eery  twitches and sequences, as if Sam Raimi wanted just to skip the  &quot;borring stuff&quot; and jump right into the &quot;scary stuff&quot;.   This was a very bad move, but at least the charactors weren't bad actors.   As a matter of fact, I thought the acting was unusually good.  But lets  just forget about the sentimental part, any true horror fan will just focus  mainly on the gore factors.  In this case, Evil Dead is a masterpiece of  horrific disfigurement and unconcerned cannibalism.  Its not a non-stop  blood-fest, but when the heat is up, the fire starts burning.  There's even  a very creepy and distastefully sexual encounter with a monster tree, but  lets not get into that.  My main point is, that Evil Dead can only be  reveled at, not experienced.  The storyline is so choppy that tension  development will rarely occur.  If you're looking for a good time, buy the  sequal: Evil Dead 2; if you're looking for a scare, go to a haunted house  or something, cause this one won't delivere the goods.  I'd buy it for the  special effects though; its cheap, but very explicit.  I give this movie  credit strictly based on its ability to deliver massive amounts of gore,  not its emotional effectiveness.

The most great songs for me are: The sun always shines on T.V., Train of Thought, Hunting High  and Low and the classical Take on Me, but each song it's so good for create  a great album, the composition of Mags and Paul and the voice of Morten  become this album in the best of the best of this group.
B0000256VK|5.0|After reigniting their creative fuse with FLESH + BLOOD, the time seemed to be right for Roxy Music to be a band again. But there was still dissension, and Bryan Ferry seemed to have more fun with his solo career  than being the leader of a band. So before AVALON was demoed, it seemed  this was intended to be Roxy's second and presumably final swan song. While  it's an album that could have used a follow-up, AVALON is still an  appropriate farewell to Roxy. With members approaching middle age, their  mellowing out in their later years now seems warranted. &quot;More Than  This&quot; could only have come to pass as a slightly beat-driven ballad.  Phil Manzanera's guitar work is his all-time greatest, and his opening  figure on &quot;More Than This&quot; has to be the most beautiful use of  electric guitar ever recorded. And for the first time in ages, Bryan Ferry  turns in a convincingly emotional performance on a song that could also be  a goodbye to his days as leader of Roxy Music. While they hadn't really had  a hit since &quot;Love Is The Drug&quot;, I'll bet songs like the title  track, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, &quot;While My Heart Is Still  Beating,&quot; &quot;To Turn You On&quot;, and &quot;Take A Chance With  Me&quot; had to be the smoothest pop music permeating from the world's  radios in 1982 (I was only 2 at the time). Roxy's first  &quot;break-up&quot; was really a hiatus of sorts, but so far, 18 years  after AVALON, it appears as if Roxy Music really is no more. If that's the  case, then thank you, Roxy, for going out with some style.
B00004THAY|5.0|B.B. King and Eric Clapton create musical magic. Both are in terrific voice and spirited in their guitar interplay. Not only does this record showcase the musicians' guitar and vocal talents, its warmth leads you to  believe these legends are really just a couple of old friends who'd be  strumming 'n' plucking together even if the recorders weren't on. That  fun-loving musicality comes through best on the chicago-blues classic  &quot;worried life blues&quot;. The dozen-song disc features a few  contemporary tunes, some classic blues and a handful of Kings's originals.  Although there isn't a dog in the batch, King's slow-burning blues ballad  &quot;when my heart beats like a hammer&quot; is outstanding, as is  &quot;Key to the Highway&quot;. This is a timeless disc that you'll own and  play for a lifetime.
B00004THAY|5.0|For too long Eric got stuck in the mid-80s, with production far too smooth and synthetic than his playing - or the blues for that matter - truly deserved. Then came Unplugged, and the consequent return to raw, live recording with From The Cradle. Riding With The King is the perfect balance between the smooth production and the rough-edged performances we know EC can deliver. And if that weren't enough to get you going, every track is a duet with the mellowing but still statesman-like BB King.<br />Having seen BB in Brighton last year, I am very pleased to see the inclusion of Help The Poor, and if you can listen to When My Heart Beats Like A Hammer without feeling the shiver of goosebumps, then check if you can see your own reflection in the mirror, as you probably have no soul.
B0000020C4|5.0|Many people agree that this is the best of the many recordings of Les Miserables, and I number among them. Boasting an exquisite cast (correctly advertised as &quot;The Dream Cast&quot;) including Colm Wilkinson (Jean  Valjean), Philip Quast (Javert), Ruthie Henshall (Fantine), Lea Salonga  (Eponine), and Michael Ball (Marius), the performance has no lack of  talent. All of the actors give meaningful and often heart-rending  performances, and the listener often finds themself moved to tears of  identification with one of the highly archetypal characters. Since it is a  recording of a live concert, there is applause, but it is a small price to  pay for an otherwise flawless piece of work.
B000002UAU|4.0|Is Sgt. Pepper The Beatles' best album? I don't think so. Rubber Soul is probably that. That doesn't mean that this isn't a bad album, and it isn't in any way imaginable. This is just simply a very nice expierience. When  you boil the whole thing down to just the music, it is easier to focus on  it, then from being distracted by the artwork and printed lyrics and paper  dolls etc. Sgt Pepper - A really nice opening track. It is, more or less,  filler, but that doesn't mean filler has to be bad. This just basically  sets up the whole album, and does it effectively. With A Little Help From  My Friends - This one isn't quite filler, and it is a Paul song being sung  by Ringo (who does a pretty nice job). Lucy In The Sky - Wordplay and  lyrical images fill the song, which is more or less a trip 'Through The  Looking Glass'. John provides the vocals here and does a good job, though  the way his voice is sped up in the middle eight is bad sounding. Getting  Better - An optimistic, yet slightly sinister track by Paul and John.  Darker lyrics than most earlier Beatle songs here, and they work well. It  is currently being butchered in Phillips commercials around the country.  Fixing a Hole - whatever anyone says this song is supposed to mean doesn't  really matter, the song isn't really specific enough to keep you from  trying to find out multiple meanings. A decent song, but a slightly  unnerving melody bogs it down. She's Leaving Home - It takes a few listens  to this to fully appreciate it, but it is worth it. Lyrics that really tell  a story accompained by soap-opera-like music. And to boot, the song also  has a moral (listen the person out, don't make assumptions by yourself).  Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite - Lennon generally reading off of a  circus poster. This one is just average: the music sets the mood but really  isn't all that good, but the lyrics are above average. Within You Without  You - George doing his Ravi Shankar-Indian music thing. This mixes with the  rest of the album like oil and water. It really doesn't do anything for the  album, but it's not a horrible songwriting attempt by George. When I'm 64 -  Probably the worst music on the album. The lyrics aren't terrible, but they  aren't great either. Sub-par. Lovely Rita - Not too bad music or lyrics,  but the vocals aren't very good. It sounds like they played the instruments  for this one while they were drunk. Good Morning Good Morning - A generally  good song. Good lyrically, good musically, Good morning Good morning. Not  to mention it has a really good guitar solo. Sgt. Pepper (reprise)- More  downright fun and rocking than the first track. They could have made this  track a bit longer, but it serves its purpose which I suppose was all it  was meant to do. A Day In The Life - Absolute Nirvana. This is a great song  by John and Paul, and is a fantastic closer to the album. The only problem  with it is that there's no never-ending 'inner groove' on the CD. Well,  that's it. Sgt. Pepper is a really good album, slight blemishes and all,  but I think it is a tad too much on the poppy side with not enough true  rock songs on it. Still, a neccesary album for any cd (or record)  collection.
B000002MQ9|5.0|I rediscovered this CD after approx. three years of not listening to it.  Then after hearing the awe inspiring soundtrack to &quot;Gladiator&quot; (thankyouverymuch Lisa!) I gave it a spin.  Wow.  I was transported to  another time in my life...or maybe just another time.  &quot;Cantara&quot;  is my favorite on the album, listening to it takes me to a dark barely lit  castle where I am lost and whirling in a maze of black and grey stone,  always a step behind the woman with the candle.  I had the other worldly  experiance of seeing Lisa G. and DCD live, and they have talent I cannot  devote more than the highest praise to.  If you are even a borderline DCD  fan, this album is a must.
014028009X|5.0|Any single woman in her 20's or 30's MUST read this book.  I was skeptical at first; my best friend told me I had to read it.  I've always thought that I was a freak and that I was the only single woman around that  couldn't figure out why she was single.  Bridget Jones is the English  version of Ally McBeal.  Any single woman looking for her Prince Charming  will instantly relate to Bridget.  Some of the things she says are so  hilarious, because you think you are the only one in the world that ever  thought like that, and now you realize you are not.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Fight Club represents a virtuoso performance from all three of its principal actors (Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter), as well as in the cinematography and direction that transform it into a  surreal experience more meaningful than a first glance might reveal.   Edward Norton is well know for the depth his brings to conflicted roles  (Primal Fear, American History X), but the surprise here is in how  effectively Pitt assumes a persona both supremely irreverant (&quot;God  hates you,&quot; he says at one point) and with the spiritual gravamen of  Nietzche's Zarathustra.<br />Indeed, for all the press given to the violent  aspects of the film, it is not a film about violence.  Nor is violence even  the medium for a greater message, as might be argued of such films as  Saving Private Ryan.  Rather, violence is a passing example of the  existential message the film examples:  What is reality, and how can man  transcend it?  How does man become the ubermensch?  Nietzche is a powerful  spectre over the entire film, and the brilliant and diorienting skills of  Jeff Cronenweth keep you from ever truly pinning down the  &quot;truth.&quot;  This elusiveness is, of course, inherent to the  message.<br />But even as Fight Club examines questions that deal with the  very soul of mankind, it still appeals to the casual viewer.  It is of  importance that the viewer not be drawn into the trap of deriving some  perverse pleasure from the violence.  Rather, the violence so ludicrously  decried by some critics (Ken Turin of the Times likened the film to Nazi  propaganda) is an example of the failures of mankind, something we can be  fascinated by but never approve.  The mystery of the story envelops the  viewer, drawing us into a seemingly normal life that rapidly spirals out of  control into a mesmerizing sequence of revelation and epiphany.  We are  edified along with the protagonist; his confusions are our confusions; his  triumphs are ours; the film's triumph isours as well.  <br />This movie would  easily rate five stars for its searching message and enthralling  production, but it has received such venom from some reviewers that I  cannot in good faith totally ignore their opinions that the movie dwells  too much on the violence.  I must state categorically that it dos not, but  I must recognize that the movei did not appeal to everyeone.  Moreover,  those squeamish of violence with enjoy this movie no more than Last of the  Mohicans:  a good movie with far more violence than this one.  Still,  amovie that cannot appeal to everyone does not merit a full five-star  rating.<br />But as long as you can take a little blood on your way to the  ending, do indulge yourself in the brilliant tour de force--consider it a  philosophy lesson and rollicking trip at once.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I am completely speechless...what can I say?  I love this album!  I had never really been big on Savage Garden until I heard, &quot;To The Moon And Back&quot; off of their first CD. I love that song. Even then I never  really listened to them much. Then I heard, &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;.  Now there is a song that could make anyone's heart melt (Darren's voice is  just so soothing). I was constantly listening to that song. Then one of my  friend's bought &quot;Affirmation&quot;, and we both listened to the entire  CD. It's awesome!  It's not just one or two songs, but the whole CD. It's  hard to pinpoint a favorite on the album because each song holds  significant meaning. &quot;The Lover After Me&quot; could be awarded  &quot;The Song Most Likely To Make Anyone Cry&quot;. It's beautifully  written, and I get choked up inside everytime I listen to it. I can't  imagine how Darren feels. I hear the album was written during the divorce  between him and his wife. That is why some of the songs on the album sound  so sad, and you can tell...especially in &quot;I Don't Know You  Anymore&quot;. I like this album a lot because I can listen to it when I  feel sad, or I can put it in when I'm psyched or happy. Any band or artist  who is able to do that with an album definitely deserves 5 stars. So if you  are a Savage Garden fan, definitely get the album, if you aren't buy it  because after you listen to it, you will be one! :)
0767903854|5.0|I am an unreserved Bryson fan. I love &quot;Made In America&quot; about the English language, and, as an Australian living in England for an extended time, thought he captured perfectly both the expat experience, and  the endearing and irritating qualities of the Brits in &quot;Notes from a  small island&quot; .  This book is factually correct. That might sound  inane, but there is nothing more irritating than reading about your own  place and finding it tritely stereotypical or factually incorrect. Bill  scores well on both counts.<br />Bill's take on the Australian Prime Minister  of the day (a small, invisible and colourless entity) is a reasonably brave  thing to say in a sense - an outsider commenting on a political identity  invites derision, but he captures the essence of the man so well.<br />The  other special moment for me is his discovery of cricket on the radio...when  all other stations fade out to static, there is the mighty game. Somehow or  other, despite writing nonsense words, he captures the rhythm and cadences  of radio cricket commentary PERFECTLY. To me, cricket on the radio is as  much about summer as cicadas, running under the sprinkler and crackling  heat. Beautifully pulled off!<br />A good read, and for the first time since  leaving school I actually engaged with some of the stories of explorers!  A  wry but never cynical tone makes for an entertaining read. I am glad he  pays &quot;homage&quot; to that other good 'outsider's book' -  &quot;Sydney&quot; by Jan Morris.<br />Bill Bryson covers much of the same  terrain as the other great US travel writer, Paul Theroux, and seems to  meet as many odd or intersting characters. Bill's disposition, however,  makes him far more open to LIKING a place, and enormously less  self-absorbed.<br />Recommended.
6304083777|5.0|WOW! I say again WOW! Masamune Shirow's masterpiece &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; was orginally manga yet it is even better as an anime. At first I was scepitical about this one, consider the anime &quot;Appleseed&quot;,  yet never did I expect it to surpase the manga. Director Mamoru Oshi, whom  directed Patlabor and Patlabor 2, creates a future where what you see is  not always real. In the future humans can connect with the internet through  inplants on the back of their necks. A mysterious hacker known only as the  Puppet Master has begun to hack into people minds creating a false memor in  their brain, thus able to manipulate them like a puppet. Major Kusanagi is  an assassin for a branch of the government known as Section 9. Soon the  major and her team begin a hunt for the mysterious Puppet Master that leads  from hidden agendas and government conspiracies to a scientific discovery  that could redifine humanity. Ghost in the Shell is anime that has given  rise to such films as &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The animation is as good if  not better then that of Patlabor 2 and Wing of Honneamise. The voices are  good yet I have heard a better voice cast, such as &quot;Neon Genisis  Evangelion&quot;. The musical score like &quot;Patlabor 2&quot; is haunting  yet also tranquil, I highly recomend the soundtrack. Ghost in the Shell  asks all of us one question that will make you think &quot;What does it  mean to be alive?, what does it mean to be human?&quot; This video is worth  every penny you pay. Warning this film contains scenes of intense violence,  nudity, and strong language recommended viewing is for 17 and up.
080017948X|4.0|I have to say, I did not particularly like this film on first viewing. However, watching it a couple more times, it has really grown on me. You pick up more each time you see it, and you also appreciate Bill Murray's  excellent performance much more. Another hit from the much under-rated  Harold Ramis!
0316777722|5.0|Unless you don't mind people staring at you while you laugh so hard you spill your mocha frappachino on your lap.  This is the most delightful, funny book I have read in years. If you haven't heard David Sedaris on NPR  then you are missing a wonderful experience.
B00004RFFI|4.0|I still love this movie man!wow! finally WB has come out with DTS surround sound.The DTS sound is  better then the DOLBY DIGITAL,the storm the wind in this movie was great,is very loud is like your there of the middle of the  action.This DVD got good extra feature like commentary,behind-the-scene of  twister and more.The picture is great too &quot;crystal clear  baby!&quot;(&quot;WARNER BROS. put more movie with DTS sound! &quot;)
0767903854|5.0|I started this book with some trepidation.  On the one hand I wanted it to be like his previous books, on the other I didn't want it just to be an Australia flavoured version of &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot;.<br />I  was very pleased on both counts.  From the way he writes it is very easy to  believe that's how it would be if you were to make the same journey.  The  book portrays the places he visits in a very realistic way.  Too often  travel writers romanticise the places they visit so much that they deliver  a work of fiction but not here.<br />It may be better to read the book after  you've been to Australia than before.  In that way you can join in with him  in a &quot;Yep.  Been there, done that.  That happened to me too.&quot;  sort of way, rather than go there and find out out he's already taken  you.<br />Even if you've no intention of going there, it's still very much  worth reading.
6305046832|5.0|i've seen people being eaten by various species of animals or aliens and being mutilated by psychos and thrillkillers since i was just a wee tyke, but this low budget masterpiece of suggested horror is one of only a  handful of horror films which have actually scared me.  that first glimpse  of actor/director Herk Harvey standing in the middle of the road is worth a  million shower slayings. the inspiration for Night of the Living Dead and  Jacob's Ladder (just to name a few) this film is not to be missed.
B00004SCBF|4.0|This limited edition of the Islands album is the best version so far: it has been remastered in 24-bit and it includes the &quot;missing secret track&quot; at the end of the last song (which is not present in the normal edition of the CD). The packaging is incredible, it's a cardboard gatefold with the original lyrics and it comes with an EXTRA BOOKLET with photos and newspaper clippings about the album and tour.
6304233639|4.0|Ok, so this movie may have lacked a lot of elements that make movies great movies great, but it did have something most high-budget movies don't, a good plot.  Ok, so I know it was about aliens who try to take over the  world in a very inefficient way (the could only blow-up one building at a  time) and lots of other things of that nature, but it did it in a  believeable way.  The actors held the script together. And maybe it was  silly, but isn't that what movies are all about?  Who wants to see a movie  about how bad life really is?
B000003RCY|5.0|My dad got me this as something of a joke present to my learning German, but as soon as I got into it, it hasn't let me go since. I love the album and have gotten totally into the band in the few years since my  introduction, and I can say, by far and wide, this is the better album of  the 2 and Der Meister and Das Alte Leid are the best songs. The only thing  I don't like about this CD is if you can understand the lyrics, which are  either ridiculously aggressive or perverted and sometimes both, it almost  takes all your enjoyment away. But I do love the sound of the German words.  Don't buy this CD for its evil intentions, buy it as an inspiration for  whatever power you need.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is one unique film and a fine piece of work, but it is not for the easily bored. You don't even realize what an awesome film it is until you've all but finished watching it.<br />So many seemingly unconnected things  and people turn out to be connected in the strangest ways. The film is  reminiscent of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and Robert Altman's  &quot;Shortcuts,&quot; but it's even more subtle in how each character is  unknowingly connected to one another.  Makes you mentally take a  double-take with the whole &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;  thing.<br />One incredible performance after another. Nearly every unpleasant  human experience happens in this film... racism, suicide, murder, incest,  drug abuse, murder, jealousy, death bed confessions and more... yet the  experiences bring the best out of these characters.  Some characters you  end up hating and others you end up liking in spite of yourself.<br />There is  nudity, one graphic (albeit extremely brief... about 1 second) sex scene  and about the worst language you have ever heard in film, so this is not  suitable for kids.  If you're into good film, deep thoughts and appreciate  the art of fine storytelling, this is a film you should see. Having it on  DVD is another plus as you can jump chapter to chapter after you have  watched the movie through the first time. After you see the whole film and  it finally all makes sense, you'll want to watch it again to catch all the  subtle clues and references (I can't tell you what references w/o spoiling  the film) through out.
0198534469|5.0|Although mathematical visualization has not been as implicitly forbidden in modern mathematics as claimed by Needham, his work is nonetheless highly innovative even besides his wonderful graphs. The reason is that his prose  accompanies very well his extraordinary insight and intuition for the  subject. It is purposely not extremely rigorous in order to make the  presentation smoother. (This is not so bad as many think. Complex analysis  is the target of many excellent books which, fortunately, do not all take  the same approach. For more rigor see Ahlfors' &quot;Complex  Analysis.&quot;) <br />This book can therefore be an ideal way to get started  with complex analysis or even to further one's understanding in the  subject. If you are looking for a very affordable predecessor with a  similar intuitive style, check Flanigan's &quot;Complex Variables.&quot;
6305358613|5.0|Beautiful, rich, exquisite, exciting and just plain superb.  Cate Blanchet earned a much-deserved Oscar nomination for best actress for her portrayal of England's most famous Matriarch, Elizabeth I.<br />The movie gives insights  into what was going on with Elizabeth's half-sister, Mary Queen of Scots  and her apparent dementia resulting from multiple tumors and probably a  touch of syphillis to boot. The persecution of Protestants under the reign  of  the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots plainly shows what a harsh time this  was and how much danger Elizabeth was in when it was clear that her sister  had not produced an heir to the throne and her death was imminent.<br />The  acting and scenery are breath-taking and you quickly forget you're watching  a movie, but feel like you're right there as an observer in time, watching  historical events unfold.<br />The movie is riddled with brute violence, but  not violence for its own sake. Likewise, there is nudity and at least one  sex scene that leaves nothing to the imagination... so this is not for  young viewers. Nevertheless, this is a spectacular piece of  filmmaking.<br />You get a deeper respect and awe for the historical person of  Elizabeth, realizing what she overcame despite being a woman in a time when  women were only accessories to men. A true leader and a queen passionate  about her very important role - not satisfied with sitting on her laurels  and just enjoying royal treatment... she was fervently involved in all  aspects of government and was probably driven to be so involved due to the  volitile time in which she reigned.<br />I'm not a history buff, but I loved  this film. The DVD is splendid and includes trailers, behind the scenes  footage, cast bios and a featurette about the film.  The menus on the DVD  are in the same caliber as the film itself. If you're going to get this  film, this is the format in which to view it.  This is the type of film of  which other films of this genre can be measured against. If you liked  &quot;Anne of a Thousand Days&quot; with Richard Burton and &quot;The  Virgin Queen&quot; with Bette Davis, this film will blow you away.ainst.

B000002KON|4.0|This odd, bloated, slightly unfinished-sounding opus is massively overrated (&quot;Village Green&quot; it ain't), but it does contain some great Ray Davies tunes.  &quot;Yes Sir, No Sir&quot;, &quot;Some Mother's  Son&quot;, and &quot;Shangri-La&quot; are all excellent and nearly up to  the standard that this fine band had set with previous efforts.  But most  of the rest of this album hints at the rot that had set in and just started  to fester as the 60s came to a close.  Proceed with caution....
B00001OH7O|5.0|I got my first real taste of Bowie with Ziggy Stardust, which is one of the greatest Rock&amp;Roll pop albums of all time. I was very surprised and pleasantly, I might add,when I first heard Hunky Dory at the age of 16.  It's quite different from Ziggy, but then everything he did for many years  was quite a departure from what came before it. It's a much more subdued  sound than many of his other works. The wonderfull, classical piano work  here is from Rick Wakeman of Yes fame. Wakeman also worked with him on  Space Oddity before being snatched up by The Strawbs, another one of my  early 70's favorites. I enjoy this one just as much and maybe even a little  more than Ziggy.His lyrics here are wonderfully insightfull, dark and  cryptic. The music of his early period from 69-73 had a major impact on me.  He made young minds think as well as play air guitar.
B00004SCBE|4.0|The fragile yet phenomenal incarnation of King Crimson of 1969 had dissolved. The main composer, Ian McDonald, left the group and Greg Lake was very anxious to join ELP. Robert Fripp, now the &quot;leader&quot; and  only composer persuaded him and Michael Giles to record this album. In The  Wake Of Poseidon consists of some pieces previously played live, with  slight adaptations and unused material. Probably Fripp only composed the  title track and the Peace segments all by his own. His guitar is not the  main instrument here, instead is the marvelous mellotron. The heavy and  jazzy &quot;Pictures of a City&quot; starring excellent guitars and saxes  was called &quot;A Man, A City&quot; on the previous tour. Incredible song,  kinda like the &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; of the album.  &quot;Cadence and Cascade&quot; is probably the most beautiful song the  group has ever recorded, with Fripp in acoustic guitar and Mel Collins does  some exquisite flute work. The mellotron-laden &quot;In The Wake Of  Poseidon&quot; it's also very good, resembles both &quot;Epitaph&quot; and  &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot; at the same time. Side two (on  which the resemblances to the previous album dissapears) begins with  &quot;Peace - a Theme&quot;, which is a gorgeous acoustic guitar piece that  introduces the unique &quot;Cat Food&quot;. Some would call it &quot;dark  jazz&quot;, with humorous lyrics and Keith Tippett's crazy piano. The album  closes with &quot;The Devil's Triangle&quot;, an adaptation of Gustav  Holst's &quot;Mars&quot; (also played on the 69 tour), quite interesting  and frightening, with an extremely experimental section at the end. Next  there is a small &quot;Peace - An End&quot;, which is &quot;Peace - a  Theme&quot; with lyrics. This is a great album, if you liked the first, you  should like this one, and vice-versa. Plus, this is the Gatefold Remaster  version that comes with an extra booklet with newspaper clippings and  photos aboutthe album. Besides, with the new 24-bit remastering, this  album has never sounded this good.
185984054X|5.0|A quick, pithy read, and quite truly a well needed critical glance at the manufacture of a saint.  Even if we take it as a given that Mother Teresa was well-intentioned, there are several incongruities between the persona  presented by the media and Christians, and the actual person.  Mother  Teresa's association with Charles Keating, the S &amp; L embezzler, in  addition to her dealings with Haitian dictators all come under fire- and  with good reason seeing as at the time of the printing of the book Teresa's  organization had not returned any of Keating's embezzled donations to their  rightful owners.   Hitchens makes the case that Teresa's character has been  inviolate simply because of the vicarious alleviation of guilt over the  sufferings of the third world.  But just because Mother Teresa happened to  do something, would be neglecting to note whether her aid was effective  considering the resources available due to her prestige.  There is reason  to doubt this, due to the pathological austerity of the Sist'az of Caritas.    Hitchens makes a number of sapient points which reveal the insipid nature  of Teresa's ideology, as well as the intellectual poverty which seems to  have accompanied Teresa's vow of material poverty.  The bottom line is that  charity done in stupidity may actually be harmful in the long term, and  that many of Teresa's opinions are detestable in consideration of the side  effects of unrestrained population growth.   It may be the case that Mother  Teresa has just been one of the most mediagenic of proselytizers, and a  unthinking zealot, far from worthy of sentimental encomiums.
076783819X|4.0|This is certainly not your stereotype, run-of-the-mill action film.  Rather, it makes you think about issues involved and tends to leave you a little paranoid.  The ending was really good, avoiding the cliche of  &quot;hero saves the day, helped by all-powerful FBI/police.&quot;  Instead  you get an ending which, without revealing it, I will say is deeply  disturbing.  It left me severely rattled for a long time after watching it.   Not a scary ending, just a chilling one.<br />The only real problem I had  with this film was Tim Robbins.  He is just not an actor I believed as a  villain.  He didn't exude evil the way some movie bad guys do; and this was  too much of a stretch from his previous work.  More believeable was Joan  Cusack as Robbins' wife, because the person her character is presenting to  the world is more in line with what you expect from her.
6305807086|5.0|Being John Malkovich is the most original and entertainig movie of 1999.  I will join Ebert in giving it a thumbs up. I will aslo join Ebert in calling it my favorite movie of 1999.  Roger Ebert is known for viewing and  reviewing many pictures over our time. And 1999 was no different for the  reviewer. However he can only make one movie his best picture of 1999, and  that was Being John Malkovich.  If it is good enough for Roger and Me than  it's good enough for you. Sorry Michael Moore about the Roger and Me pun.   I don't want to say much about this film other than it is very original and  tightly written. I could not find any holes in the movie. It's a movie full  of forshadowing and full of symbols.  So free your mind of any thought, and  sit down and pop in Being John Malkovich, and enjoy.
B00004THAY|5.0|This stuff is absolutely killer! Best I've heard in several months (and I've heard alot!)These two masters play off each other so fluidly and, well, perfectly. From Hiatt's title track thru several BB tunes, a cover of  Big Bill Broonzy's &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; all the way to a version  of &quot;Hold on,I'm Coming&quot; which destroys the original and takes it  to completely new heights! This album is sure to sweep the Grammy's, mark  my words!
