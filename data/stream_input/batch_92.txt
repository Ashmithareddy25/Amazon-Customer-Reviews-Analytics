B00NMVMYDK|3|too large
B00DMWQJ58|5|great buy for a roaring 20's party.  Helped to make the outfit.
B00CO6I744|3|they are ok, kind of thin. received 2 with holes in them. Would not order again. Orignally ordered for my son, because they were listed as mens, but they are very small.
B00E576UFI|5|good
B00246F1B6|5|I've worn this brand and style before, so I knew which size and how it fit. They do run a little big compared to other scrubs.  I usually wear a 10-12 and the medium top and bottom fit loosely. They are good quality.
B00H1NOPCI|2|Shipping for this tiny pin is ridicules, it was twice/three the price of the button. The pin itself is very small, the catalog picture does not give justice to how small this pin is! I was disappointed in this purchase.
B00JLTI8SW|5|Love!!
B000J4IGGW|5|I got this for my daughters first Halloween costume! Very pleased with the product and the price is great. My daughter is 10 months old and will be 11 months when Halloween comes up. She's very petite and this fits nicely. We live in Arizona so I'm glad its not very heavy. Perfect for a first Halloween costume for her.
B0031U0PAG|5|So far the belt is holding up great! I had read where others said there was a smell to the belt. There was a small odor when I opened the package, but that went away quickly. Very happy with the purchase.
B0043WXWIS|5|These wristbands fit my nephew perfectly yet I find that they will still work for him as he grows up! The quality is superb and Amazon is wonderful to do business with. Thank You!
B00CX2IDEI|5|I loathe spandex in denim. I mean, I know some ladies love it, but I really missed my old standbys - until I found these. Yep, first 3 pairs I bought at a farm store - and I buy more because my hips change - not the jeans fault there. They are true to size. I had a problem finding 34 inch inseams, and these are just perfect. These have that good ol' denim with a smidge of spandex for comfort and wearability. Jeans should last decades, and these do - I have never had a seam split. Now, I did lose a pair to a bleach accident - but that was merely because it was obvious there was a bleach accident. I need to move in my jeans, and these allow me to work all day, because, quite frankly, I need them to protect my legs. Which is why jeans exist. Work. These are jeans to get the job done.
B002ZENMBI|5|This beanie suits fine because u wear it as is on the picture. Most people complain because they mistake it for traditional beanies that bend up on the ends, well not this one. I guess people call them &#34;Skullies&#34; because they go all around your skull. The bad reviews are people who are mistaken so don't be one of them and realize it isn't a typical beanie... it's a Skullie
B00F4N6DY0|2|Wrinkles really bad in the wash, I hate ironing!!!
B00JM8MVFS|4|Good so far
B008G7JRLM|2|The &#34;small&#34; size is insanely long while fitting nicely otherwise. A couple more inches and it would be a dress. Never had this problem with other hoodies.
B004V9QEXS|3|I received my wallet quickly.<br />Item was not as pictured...no strap to keep it closed and not \\"eelskin\\" looking.<br />The wallet does not hold 20 cards without making the item too tight.<br />The stem needs to be longer to hold 20 cards comfortably and permitting easy access when full.<br />Not expensive enough to bother returning, but very disappointed.<br />The item needs a longer stem, both covers need to be separate (NOT open like a book), and have a strap for closure.
B0007KKYV8|5|I don't have many cards, which fits this well-made, compact wallet well. I've found to it be a perfect size to keep in my front pocket.
B00MGFCXZ2|5|Exactly as described. Fast Shipping.
B00012O1DO|3|Pants fit too tight around waist.
B00634O5RQ|5|My science geek son loved this sweatshirt. The washing directions though say to dry flat so you will have to take extra care when washing. But I have washed it once and dried flat and it still looks great.
B00JOALRRW|5|Make sure you look at the size chart!! Comfy material, fun dress.
B006PGGJOE|4|Black aluminum wallet works well with all my extra credit cards. I gave my wife one<br />and she loves it. This wallet takes care of everything  I needed. I have no problem<br />in recommending the wallet to anyone.
B00AZ1YT4M|2|I am quite upset because i was super excited to get these. I had got them within two days after I ordered them. And I am a curvy girl with a goodly sized bottom and I have a muffin top so I tried them on. They are really comfortable, but TOTALLY see through and so I can only wear these under something. Might try to find a non transparent pair.
B004DQCT0Q|5|Very very quickly, and thats right.
B004FUSDT6|5|100% recomendado
B001O36PVK|5|My daugther loves her luggage.   She enjoyed showing it off to her friends during her trip to the Inauguration!! It was easy to spot in the baggage depot too!! Thanks!!
B00817JYEM|5|Love the product :)
B00EGM681I|1|Couldn't help but notice that you directly ripped off my t-shirt design (g4tsby tees.) I applaud you sir or madam on your cunning and ingenuity (read: lack of creativity and desperation for petty cash.) Have a wonderful day, you worthless piece of s***.
B004YT4LQM|4|Ordered through Amazon with Amazon Prime. Thankfully I read the reviews before hand, but yes this costume includes the Silver ironed on designs on the sleeves and boot covers.<br /><br />Overall the fabric was normal stretch polyester, though when the fabric is stretched the silver designs crack which for me was not a large deal but for some I know it would be a deal breaker. The shade of blue was as showed and the trim is silver. The top came a bit stretched on one side in the front and a bit too large for my chest which is a 32B. but there are around 3 little notches you can slide the back latch into which fixed it.<br /><br />Also the arm bands and boot covers kept sliding down while I walked around. The arm bands can be fixed with a little fashion tape but the boot covers I couldn't figure out how to stay up so I ended up rolling them down which made them look shorter blue boots instead. If anyone has a solution for how to keep the boot covers stiff and up on the thighs I'd love to know!<br /><br />It was a decent price for the whole costume which came with the headband, mask, armbands, sleeves, shorts w/apron, and boot covers. The fabric was pretty durable and the color was nice. The only problems were with some schematics of the costume.
B0018ON3CY|4|Very good. nice price.
B008QZQCZS|2|I normally wear a 38G in most Cleo bras, but I've tried this bra in 38G and 38FF and I still can't get it to fit right! The band is great, but the cups are totally weird. I'm full on top, but the top of the cups were gaping. The cups also seemed really far apart and made my breasts look like wall-eyed. Not a good look.
B00KB9ZP7S|4|The waistband was too large, everything else was perfect. I'm just going to take in the waistband, since the rest of the fit is perfect. It might be my specific size as a human who might be shaped differently from other humans. Love the color, fabric is soft and a good weight, seams are adequate.
B00NNBV3FO|5|If you like surfer style for your baby or just as a gift I extremely recommend it.
5555012330|5|NICE ! Finally able to find a &#34;I am the Stig&#34; t shirt, many thanks
B00JM52DUE|5|Very good.
B00BL951JO|4|I got a medium and it fits like a large. So keep that in mind.
B003X07WG4|3|The pants were great the problem is Is I bought them with the matching zip hoodie but the brown shades did not match I was very disappointed
B00MN6PKSQ|5|Cute my daughter loves it
B00F8IEW5S|4|Love it
B00C8GBZJY|3|These are not bad, but for someone who has larger arms they are a little tight. But if you need to protect yourself from the sun's rays, they are worth it.
B008H7OWUC|5|The writing stays on. The color never fades. The material is awesome. I don't have any regrets buying this shirt. LOVE IT!! I have mine almost a year now. Nice....
B00C2WV6FC|4|I actually LOVE the colors in this scarf.  The bad thing about it is that it has a sticker on it.  You can't pick the sticker off because it will rip the material.  It isn't a piece you will have for years to come.
B00NHLZZ90|5|I loved them, very cute!!
B00B6EARB6|2|didn't fit me
B008MHFRZ6|3|The zipper failed the first day I wore it.  Just split open from the bottom up.  I was eventually able to yank it back down and get it separated.  Then the zipper would catch again and zip back up.  But I fully expect it to continue to fail like this.<br />I bought it because it was cheap.  You get what you pay for.
B00JC4JCPO|3|This was way too wide in the waist and way to short in length. Its a great quality and very warm I just felt like a penguin while wearing it :/
B007MS52CO|4|This was a great product for the price.
B00NIVOAAY|2|It broke at the party.
B00X5IY9K6|5|Yep. It's a nice hat, I bought it expecting a quality hat, and I got a better hat in the mail shortly after. It's comfortable, easy to adjust, and it looks great.
B00N3N5V5U|5|I got a size bigger then recommended due to reviews saying to go up to 2 sizes bigger. I am 5'2&#34; and 149lbs. I got the xL and it was to big, i should have gone with the recommended size for me. I still love it, it just didn't slim me the way it should have. I plan to get another one in the correct size.
B00K1Y6MQQ|4|I like the fit of these jeans, which I already knew I would from past experience.  My only problem with Lee is that their average/medium length is to long on me (I'm 5'4\\") and their short length is too short.  Also, I found these jeans through some sort of \\"fit\\" guide... I was looking for \\"high waist\\" jeans... these are not high waist, I believe they were labeled \\"mid rise\\".
B005UYLNAW|5|Lovely tie from Scotland.  It is just what I was looking for.  It is the perfect tie to wear with a black or grey suit.
B00FWDRCKG|5|I wore my coat snow skiing and kept nice and warm.  It looks great.
B00B4X8CUW|4|The material feels thin, but the shirt washed and ironed well.  I hope it holds up.  It's a great color for holidays!  My husband likes it and it fits well.
B00CJ39ZRA|5|Gave this hat 5 stars because it shipped from New Jersey to my house in 3 days!<br />- Hat looks exactly like photo<br />- No Snags, No fading, Correct spelling & great stitching<br />- Fits very comfortably, Sent this link to friends & family !<br /><br />And the price is amazing as well!
B008HAWAWG|4|Although I had hoped for a bit softer fabric, the shirts are exactly what I expected. To keep from shrinking, I have not put them in the dryer. They also have flattering fit, but also very comfortable.  An inch or so longer than I would have expected.. which was a pleasant surprise, since many shirts I think are too short.  Loving them.
B00JARP7K2|2|My head measures 23&#34; which is the top end of Large for most of the hats I looked at. This &#34;one size fits most&#34; was too small for me. The brim was also bent a bit by the shipping box being just a bit too narrow.
B001U3O8O0|4|Good quality. Was a bit small.
B008VUQLWM|5|Was looking for a rugged pair of work shorts. These shorts are just as described, and service was great! Definitely would purchase again.
B0093KVC2S|5|I am size 12 and my bra size is 36D.  I bought XL for this corset and fits me very well.  You can adjust it on the back with ribbons, and it's easy to put on and off with front zipper.
B00593JLSU|5|This is a very soft and warm snowsuit.  The fabric is a little slippery but it looks great and is warm.  Highly recommend.
B00O3JR2QE|2|The belt is not real leather and the fake tan layer chipped off after a week of wearing it. I do not recommend this item.
B001QVMW12|5|Perfect accesory if you want to look like a million bucks. As soon as I wrapped it around my neck it felt so good, this is not a cheap product at all.
B006LHMVMQ|5|Fit great and do not bunch. Great for general wear or sports.
B00W6M7XMI|2|Beware! of the green... I got tricked by the picture. Loved the kimono style, the tassels, but than it arrived green :-(  I'm not impressed by that kind of trickery.
B0031U0P7Y|5|A-ONE
B00MM8NGPE|5|Perfect
B00P3YI8NO|4|Runs large. Nice fabric
B00M401I96|5|Purchased this outfit for my 2 year old, for her pictures with Santa. It's adorable!! She felt beautiful wearing it and she looked stunning!!
B007M8CN12|5|My 6 year old had a pair and Dad broke them.  Had to replace them and the second pair is as fun as the first!
B00OBS9D2S|5|Thanks
B00KWK15UM|5|Love it.  Love the 100% cotton.
B00TS49Y6A|1|Too big, not at all as shown in the picture.
B005N02EQ0|5|Exactly what i ordered and wanted.
B00FA5GZF4|4|Only problem, it's not lined. Had to buy tank dress to go under.  Weariung it out tonight for dinner. I'm 5'2&#34; so it's down to my ankles.
B006TCK0H6|5|The Jacket is perfect for spring and fall. I wear a large but was able to get away with a medium. Although the fit is a little snug no reason for a return.
B00RCL0G86|4|Great top, just wish there was a little padding built in
B008QVAFSM|5|I really like the length of the sleeves and the amazing feel of the fabric.  It is perfect for work professionl, yet warm and you can type and work without constanly pushing up the sleeves. It has an elegant feel that can go on to evening wear.
B001OZMXO6|4|Bummer! There was bird poop on the front of the vest when I took it out of the SEALED package!! What the heck! Wish I would have taken a picture of it, but I was too excited. Love the way it fits. This vest will be my new best friend.
B00ENXTN08|3|It was not for me, one friend ask me to boy it for her wedding... if you ask me, i really don't like it, but she loves it!<br />It was a weird and close-fitting in the hips. She used this one for the civil-marriage ...
B00LW4QX1S|5|My son loves these. They are slim fitting. He is 4 years old and wears between size 5-6 in clothing depending on the brand. I ordered these pajamas in a size 8 and they fit great.
B00IIXJND6|4|Fits great!
B000HOBYDG|5|As always, great product
B000KGIEMK|1|I usually purchase from Silkies but wanted to quickly add to another order on Amazon. Never expected something so gross to happen with a sock delivery. There were white lint balls, and white particles that I would hazard to guess were skin cells? Second sock carefully tucked under the first, had a hole near the band. Socks were misshapen and obviously used. Here's the clincher; the sticky Berkshire label was oh-so-carefully replaced around the item!! It fooled them and me at first, then I ran for the sanitizer. I only have two serious pet peeves; Kitchen must be super clean, and I NEVER share socks. Even my sisters keep unused socks at their house &#34;just in case&#34; for overnight guests. This is a huge quality control mistake but someone was extremely careful to rewrap this item. They will probably never read this, but the best I can do is hope a little foot karma comes your way because that was inexcusable! sheesh.
B00B93UQ4M|2|The sleeves are asymmetric and the ruffles look cheap. It is somewhat flattering to a longer torso though so if you are really tall and going to a cheap club it is alright.
B008596OA8|5|I bought it for my sister. It's nice and good in quality. The shipment arrived before the expected date. I really recommend it for you
B00E4I4XS4|5|Thick and comfy. Just what I was looking for.
B00MABSVLC|5|I bought these as a gift for my great niece who has Downs Syndrome and has to wear leg braces.  Her Mother is very please with the quality and the way they fit.  Very well worth the money spent.  I might also add that knee highs for toddlers are really hard to find.
B0014VNY9I|1|I ordered this item 3 weeks ago with Macy's store. After waiting for the shipping, they sent me a pack of three INFANTS CLOTHES ! I sent it back and it almost 2 week, I haven't received any information about my item as promise in the return policy !!Beside, I have to pay $6.95 for the shipping ( which will be charge later in my credit card according to the policy). What a service!!!
B002NPCJ5E|4|My 2.5  year old loves these, but they are a bit snug. She is an 18m waist, 2T legs, and 3T torso, so I got the 2T/3T panties and they are a little tight, and &#34;ride up&#34; rather easily (not that it bothers her like it would bother me). If I get more, I will go the next size up.
B001CWM756|5|This is a good costume for the price. I love the brand. I got an Alice in Wonderland costume and it looks fabulous and washes well!
B00K65D808|1|I received the item and it was strawberry print, not hearts, not the correct item. I'm very disappointed as I was planning to wear this this weekend.
B00CA9FZ68|5|These were perfect I bought them to wear Christmas Sunday for my boys age 4, 7, 9, 11.  It was a perfect fit/color/size!
B006PGGJOE|1|I had this for about three weeks before the clasp broke. One of the cheap plastic tabs that keep the latch closed simply snapped off, from nothing more than sitting in my pocket.
B002M5047U|1|Bummed out, in need of a decent cosume to perform a dance routine in. The standard costume is crappy thin see thru material, not sewn well and definitely not worth the money.<br />Fit was ok...I'm 5'7, size 10 with measurements 38,27,38.<br />This costume will be returned, due to poor quality and construction.
B00I059SF0|2|not bad not value for the money not satisfied with the product i expected more for the money :-( next time better
B005LLK3PK|2|Kind of junk. Had to find way to fasten it and still did not stay on. Cute but junk
B00P221AM8|5|Very pretty for the price.
B007W52ZLS|5|Excellent as expected
B00SWJERGY|5|Very cute! Had an issue & the supplier remedied it right away :)
B00LAXSWCY|5|nice quality and yummy colors highly recommend it
B00EHKCO1C|5|I wear v necks everyday and have been for sometime. I have had my first MavenOG V neck (Crivello) for over a year now. I usually give my V necks 6 months of wear and I am content throwing them away due to wash tear and the V becoming too deep! The shirt has retained its original fit since the day I purchased it.
B00F6QB45I|4|It is a bit looser than I expected, but still great! It is nice, feels soft and looks awesome!! I am happy with it
B000W18WR0|3|I bought the shirt as new - when it arrived it was in a bag but just a regular clear bag.  It had no pins in the shirt anywhere, it was missing the plastic collar up front - it obviously had been tried on and returned and now they turn around and sell it as new ! Beware !  I had just bought 2 other shirts, so I know exactly how they should come.  Amazon should be ashamed (and if they are just forwarding on 3rd party merchandise without checking, they should still be ashamed).
B00CI1HXLI|4|perfect addition for my daughters wedding dress
B00K52220Y|5|Great fit, loving the low rise slim fit and the blue colour is great.  Went back and bought the wine colour.
B00QFX5YDO|5|Wow!!!  Not only were these great quality...Delivery was the fastest I have ever had from an order.  Great job!
B004RJRAVW|5|I loved these slippers. They are super cute and fluffy. They are just adorable. My order was scheduled to be delivered 7 days after my order but it arrived 2 days after my order. I was so delighted since the order arrived 2 days before Christmas, which was when i was planning to give someone. Thank you so much for the great price and the super fast delivery!!!!
B003DVBOWQ|3|The color is not consistent throughout (some parts have a green tint to it, while others are the expected blue), and its a little too shiny for my tastes.<br /><br />I will probably fix it up a little bit (deshine with fabric softener), but it's decent.
B00HG17ETG|5|great dress shirt!
B00FARDBWM|3|This top is not as long as I had hoped especially after washing but I'll keep it. Very thin, too.
B000P8ZNKY|5|I purchased this for myself because I now more than ever believe that I need this Saint to ride with me
B00H5IR1XO|5|The dress look amazing,  the colors are vibrant and pretty , even though the little coins make noise .
B003CI1F7E|1|I ordered my exact size and it barely came up my calves. Sizes are much smaller than actual. Also I requested a return more than a week ago and as of today, I have yet to get a response.  Very displeased!
B000A33QUS|5|It came quickly and we put to use that night. And yes she does look hot in it.
B004W15TG8|2|I have thought about sending it back ... but have not done that yet. What I don't like is ... THIS IS A HAT ... just like any baseball hat. The picture did not show but I presumed that there were ear flaps that folded out from inside the hat. There are NO earflaps. Also, this is NOT a Wigens hat and when I Googled Wigens it gave me Amazon as an option. And I got to this hat via that link. NOW ... as far as a hat with no ear flaps ... it is a five star.
B007ROU6BU|3|The bolero fit nicely, enough. it was a little smaller then expected though.<br />other then size, i was also a little disappointed by the color- it was more of a dark aqua/ teal color then the blue shown in the picture.<br />It worked for the event i was going to though, and i actually liked the teal color better then the picture shown in the description of the product.<br />So in all, i liked the Bolero, but it wasn't what i had expected. the size and the color were both incorrect.
B00IY7SB2K|5|Great fix. Great product.
B00PBJ3LVK|5|very wrinkly from packaging but other than having to press out or send to cleaners, dress has good quality and fit. Overall, good buy for the money.
B00MY2LLXW|4|Warm and soft
B00HB4KID2|5|I'll most likely buy different colors in the near future.
B00YTWSFMK|5|Color is great. Style is great
B00LAYTYK2|5|I thought the pants fit great. Goes nicely with a onsie. Nice cheap pants for play and daycare.
B00D3WQM0Y|3|It wasn't as cute in person as it was online. It was a little big on me but I have been losing weight and wasn't sure what size I needed to order.
B00EK5ZP2O|5|this sweater is perfect. fits great. Ive gotten so many compliments on the mint green color. Def. one of my favorites
B0076R6L58|4|Had to return the first one and had to get one size down to get a good fit. Overall this is a nice and stylish jacket. It is good for mild cold weather. If it is cold and windy it is going to bleed through and you are gonna feel some chills. It would be best to wear a sweater underneath this jacket in those conditions or you could use this jacket and wear it underneath a heavy goat.
B00J2BQPVQ|4|This is exactly what I was looking for. We are riding bicycles along the Danube this summer and I wanted something to put over my bicycle shorts when going into the small towns. I wish it came in an extra small but the Velcro does touch for about a half an inch so it will work for me.
B00QEVLJLI|5|LOVE IT and it LOVES ME BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />The fabric is GREAT. It is made of a thick material so ladies if you are wearing this in the fall/winter/spring, its perfect (too hot for summer)<br />The design is beautiful, the darting is in the right place, the waist is positioned perfectly. The structure enhances my shape. The material is also flexible/stretchable and therefore allows for your body to make the material conform to it. There is a full length zipper in the back - easy slider<br />this dress will make you look FABULOUS since it provides a natural hour glass shape and hides anything from the upper waist on down<br />So the one issue is that the sleeves are extremely fitted (and I have relatively slim/athletic arms)<br /><br />for those of you with an hour glass shape, I suggest purchasing based upon your bust size however if you have thicker arms, you will need to take the thickness of your arms into consideration and order a size up (athletic women, your arms should fit exact in the sleeves)<br />for those of you with an apple shape, I suggest you purchase this dress based upon your bust and arms so ordering two sizes up should help with attaining the correct size where your arms can fit into the sleeves<br />for those of you with a pear shape, you shouldn't have any problem with this dress, but again, order based upon your bust size but please be sure to take into consideration the size of your arms<br /><br />If you only have the money to get one black dress, this is it. This dress is perfect for the Office or an Event.<br />This is the &#34;Little Black Dress (LBD)&#34; that will be your go to dress and fit into any social/work activity.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of my best economical purchases thus far for under 50.00 with tax and shipping - I'm elated
B00LFAKO3M|5|I am 4'11&#34;, 100 lb and size M fits me right. I can even wear two layers of clothing underneath this sweater and will still be pretty comfy. It's a really warm sweater, so it's really great to put on for short outings during 40 degree weather. However, the sleeves are a bit long on me, but i can use them to cover my fingers as the pockets are too small to keep them warm.
B00JL8Q9K2|5|Fit me to a tee!!! Love it!!!
B000V725CI|5|Perfect to size
B00FKMRZRO|5|Great socks, very comfortable and well made.
B0055C5YRM|1|Very uncomfortable and doesn't fit correctly
B00391KVLA|5|good support , great fit. I always buy JMS.
B00I2CBBCY|5|Beautiful top! The picture do it no justice. If your on the line about size choose the smaller. I had a trip planned and needed to exchange the size. Excellent, fast email response to my concerns. The exchange went very smooth and the correct size was received before I left for the trip!
B007WHW5IE|4|great price, very comfy. just a tad bit snug but that's my fault for ordering a small. will order another in the future!
B00GU4QUO0|5|This is a beautiful dress and very flattering
B006KFWPNO|5|Love these headbands and cant wait for our little one to start wearing them. I love the colors and the packaging is good too. I would recommend indeed.
B00U6U7KA2|5|Soft & comfy. Easy to use for those half asleep midnight feeding sessions
B00SL6AORO|5|Good
B004ULXJLC|2|i have this tank in a dark brown...i got it off ebay as i wanted to try it to see if i liked it and not having to pay full price..i got a XL cause i normally wear L/XL...man am i glad i didnt pay full price! what a waste of money!!!<br /><br />i put it on and it hardly had any \\"slimming\\" effect....i wore it for about 30mins while i took my daughter on a walk to the library and back..the whole time it was riding up and i had to keep pulling it down..by the time i go home i felt sweaty and took it off...<br /><br />i dont know..maybe i need a smaller size for a tighter fit?! i dont know but the fact that after 30mins of wearing it in 36degree weather and i felt sweaty by the time i got home is enough for me to NOT want to wear it anymore and to never buy this again!!
B00KJDM55Q|3|Very cute outfit-I've noticed Gerber runs small
B00280QOI2|1|The arms are very, very small.  My baby is tall and slender.  This did not fit him, at all. Very tight and uncomfortable - not true to size.
B00BGGP660|4|It was good for the price.  Nothing special because, well it is a black shirt.  I like how it fits, yes a little too small but I like things a little longer anyways.  But I would buy another one if I needed to
B006PHXUOU|5|Purchased this to go on out of country trip and very satisfied with it.  Not only that, I brought two and one is a defective due to a crack at one corner.  I email the vendor and he got back to me in a flash (few minutes) and told me that my replacement is on the way to me.  I couldn't believe it.  This vendor is the BEST.  I will buy more of his products in the future.
B00CBMTSYO|5|I can't keep my hands off my wife when she wears this! The material is so nice and it accentuates her pair so well.
B00OOEBAU2|4|Good jacket, the main issue I have with the jacket is that the shoulders are very stiff. Lifting my arms above certain degrees is difficult as the shoulder pads are rather tough and solid. Also, ordering this product was difficult since all their sizes are strange and draconian.<br /><br />I would recommend this jacket to any who live in colder areas that want something to wear that isn't a winter jacket and can keep the wind out. If you are buying this item, check VERY carefully for your size to make sure you can wear the item.
B006ZVUGRA|5|Wasn't sure what to expect since there were no reviews and they were inexpensive.  I love them!  Great quality, great fit love the colors.  I order  Dutch Blue and now just ordered the Yellow and some Savane flat front.  With free returns, worth the risk.  As nice as the $70 Penguin shorts I also bought.
B009F96I26|2|i like the color and the sequin work...but i did not like the fact it came without lining. but i can still wear it with underskirt...felt like paid too much for this one.
B00092MFUC|5|I love these leg warmers no matter which size I order. They are made well, wash/dry well, retain elasticity, and hold up whatever I put them through. I never order any other brand. And I love the stirrup feature.  Thank you.
B009FV9ZVA|5|Lightweight, easy to wear and easy to travel with and looks nice.
B002SW3EUG|2|Bought this for my 4 wk old and it's too big. Other than that, I like the glasses!
B0092QL9O4|5|Well made and extra large, should fit any large sunglasses.  If you love pink and polka-dots, you have to check this out!
B001MP8D3I|5|Beautifully made shawl, great value. I only wish in came in more colors for the same price.
B00O7698KG|5|My four year loves his pjs he doesn't want to take them off
B005CLK3J0|5|Soft and beautiful. makes me feel special and keeps my shoulders warm.
B00MIKAJZQ|5|Love this blazer!!
B00NO4GYU4|5|good
B00HQ2U9ME|5|Love it!
B00NVDZSJ6|5|I got this before time it was suppose to come. It fits amazing! Material is great for this summer, and the dress it self is great! Just how it looks in the picture!
B00IJVPI4U|3|they is no body to this material and it is not well made at all.
B0018P1W1C|5|Perfect I love them
B00DGOGXTY|5|Excellent dress like a photo
B00UJCLKG2|4|I like the adjustable head band.  A good sun hat.
B009VI01JW|1|waylon jeeninnigns is a great man. this shirt does not do him justice. long live waylon jennings!
B0050AFZ96|4|Great deal. the shirts are on the thin side and need to be washed first for sure as they are stiff and itchy our of the bag but a great undershirt / comfort shirt.
B00IXWZ9S0|4|For a gift and she loved it
B00IQ46W36|5|EXCELLENT
B00FBF3FHY|2|I liked this item originally but after wearing it for awhile I found that the arm warmers didn't stay up well. I probably would have really liked them if they had been wrist warmers instead of arm warmers. I ended up giving them to my sister.
B00LZMXKN6|5|Just right, nice material, perfect fit
B00FIZYQLQ|4|Nice but a little small but my like it
B00GDFPS3A|5|love the colors and fit of the pants!!!!
B003Y5T62Q|4|Great quality.
B0086L1IQ0|3|I ordered a 30 inseam and got a 34. The fabric is kind of slick for the office more attuned to the skater set.
B003TM0WCM|5|Fits good, comfortable and my husband thought it was funny. :)
B001NZK32G|4|I had been wanting a hat with the classic Monte Alban ad.  Now I have one.  The screening is maybe a touch shoddy, and seems to want to bleed a little in the rain, but I'm okay with that.  Eat the damn worm already.
B0035YEPWM|3|ok
B00D7UX46W|5|I really enjoy carrying this wallet, Super affordable and enough space for me, not that easy to carry bills always but the size is the best I've seen. I've had it for at least 6 months and it's holding up really well.
B009P4QDWQ|3|If only I could find these liners that actually stay on my heel!!! I got the correct size but the back of the sock seems to slip off but only on one foot. Maybe I'll order another pair and try again
B0037KLG58|5|These are so cute and soft.  My daughter wears leg braces and has to have knee high socks.  Finding some without annoying seams or patterns that irritate her legs is a challenge.  These are perfect.
B00BJOGQ1S|5|Nice Fit
B003BW6K7Q|5|I like buying, and giving unique things, and found these socks and they were well received by a 20 year young friend of my daughter's. The socks are attractive, according to the recipient, \\"awesome\\", in style, and was a cute stocking stuffer.<br /><br />Five Stars, loved them!
B00ENROU0C|3|I loved this 1 pc...great quality, nice slimming fit, however ... the color was mango and not red hot.  Needless to say I returned it becuz of this color difference.  Too bad-awesome suit!
B003IG26IM|5|I brought these socks for my daughter who has poor circulation, wears a brace, and her leg is always cold. These socks do the trick! They provide comfort under her brace, the right amount of warmth, and they can be worn, day, night or with any outfit. Just what the doctor might order, but I thought to order them on my own, and they work perfectly! :-)
B002KY0BX0|1|I am extremely disappointed in this product. My son's first time trick or treating was ruined by a cheap costume. I put it on him right before we went trick or treating and the quick snaps on the legs popped off. I had to safety pin the pant legs together, which did not last all night, So it looked like he was wearing a lion dress.  :(
B00NOEA9VE|2|Its wat to small for me to even wear.
B002HJ377A|5|Before The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee, my life was nothing more than Nascar, Coors Light, and special nights with my lady, cousin Pepper.  Not making any money and relying on squirrel burgers for dinner, I felt my life was worthless.  But once The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee entered my possession, it was like injecting the offspring of a unicorn and grizzly bear with 5,000 shots of adrenaline.  Whenever I rolled up to my local McDonald's or WalMart with this shirt on, the ladies could not keep their hands off me.  Ditching Pepper and her sister Cheyenne, I was living the dream, with 7 girlfriends at once, all thanks to this shirt.  I ordered another one in pink and that set the bar 25 times higher.  A certain &#34; Mr.Hollywood Director&#34; came knocking at my door, looking to give me a modeling deal.  Allowing my hair and girth to creep from the bottom of the shirt, all 3 wolves caught eyes from all over.  I am now currently living in a 6,000 square foot mansion, married to a supermodel, and making tens of millions a year, just because of The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee.  Many advertise the One or Two wolve shirt, but having 3 changes your life. Forever.
B00GA5RN4K|3|The height 1.73 meters, weight 75, waist circumference, long pants are too long, estimates 30L enough, the feeling of this brand of pants in the general quality
B00BGVKC7S|3|Very snug, probably need to size up 1-2 sizes. Depending on the fit you want.
B0092SPQO6|5|Love the shirt
B00BSR61JS|5|My 9 year is very happy with these shorts.  Cute details on pockets - and they are long enough to meet dress code at school.
B0042AA8C4|5|I purchased these because I wanted some cargo pants that had some shape to them. These fit the bill AND more! Not only are there 5 pockets (2 on the back, 2 in the front, 1 on the leg), but there is a D-ring (for keychains and stuff, I'm assuming) and another strap (which I'm not sure what it's for, but it'll probably come in handy). That's not all, though; these are SO comfortable. I described them to my friends as &#34;fancy PJs&#34;! Additionally, there is elastic cord on the bottom of each leg. The elastic cord can be adjusted to tighten the leg, which can convert these pants into capris. The elastic cord has a clip that can be adjusted to keep the cord in place. Although the cord hangs out, it can easily be tucked inside the leg.<br /><br />The back pockets have velcro, but it's only a little bit. It's enough to keep whatever's inside your pocket secure, but it's not obnoxiously noisy like velcro tends to be. They're big enough to fit my Samsung Galaxy Note II, which is about 3 inches wide and 6 inches long.<br /><br />As far as fitting goes, they fit PERFECTLY. I'm 170 pounds and 4'10&#34; - 4'11&#34; with 40 inch hips, and the large petite worked for me.  They're so comfy!! Like I said, &#34;fancy PJs&#34;. Except the PJs I have don't have pant pockets, so these are better.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to buy these in even more colors! Bless the Koi brand for making these pants.
B00HZB6AGA|5|I bought these items from China, so I haven't received them as so far. During my experience, these T-shirts fits very well.
B008BUA8GM|5|my son loves his hates he has a small head and it just works he has know complaint they are even durable for washing machines but don't do it too much  like anything the color will fad.....
B0036UNJKY|5|Jacket fits good, great quality, very fast delivery
B008727YHK|5|perfect fit, good costume, my daughter loves it!!!
B009TB18CK|5|Great price and good quality.  Fits great and I really love it.
B00S4RE4JY|5|Just as it looks. It came in fast😊
B009ZQSMH8|5|I bought this product to scare a gopher & keep him/her from digging a hole under my fence.  It works like a charm.  I tried several things I found via Google but they didn't work..... this does!
B00JL63PL0|5|First I would like to say that I am 6'2, 230 and literally the definition of average body weight. Not small and not fat, just average. I ordered this coat in US 3X and which I believe is AS 4X. This jacket is a bit big but that easy to fix as its wool and I can shrink it. The jacket looks amazing despite being a little loose on me. The jacket looks good but I ordered the biggest size just in case and I am glad I did.
B00A6QDRY4|5|Super bathrobe
B004YZ84RS|5|These fit my 9-year old very well.  She loves them.
B00QTLUYNC|5|These look and fit great. The waist doesn't sit too low, which means you're not tugging at it to pull it up. I'm 5' 8&#34; and 140 lbs, and usually I'm a medium. However, I bought a small b/c of the reviews saying they were larger than expected, and I'm glad I did.
B00HAXUCIK|5|Excelente
B00L66L5QK|5|So comfy look great. Did not receive those colors, but I like the colors I received more then those.
B007VCH6MU|3|This was a good price, and my 3 year old son is a Spongebob fan.  The writing is that iron-on stuff, excuse me for not knowing the proper terminology, which makes it sort of sticky.  The hat is a teeny bit big but my son is on the lower end of the 2-7 range, so I guess that's too be expected.  Overall a decent product.
B000MX5UKU|5|I have been wearing this model for years.  It always fits.
B00E5Z05VU|4|I liked them. They are see through! They are not really leggings; they are more tights.The material is stretchy, which is nice.
B002SVKHBG|5|I ordered this shirt for my husband, who is a bit picky and wanted a short sleeved shirt with a tight weave.  We'd seen some in the store, but the weave was too coarse to meet his taste.  Ordering this shirt shirt was a long shot, and it paid off - thin, as others have commented, but not too much so, and just what we were looking for in a summer shirt. Now I wish I'd ordered a few more.
B006GRHHBQ|5|I was looking for this specific camisole.  At a recent health retreat they provided clothes and this type camisole was included.  It was comfortable.  I can wear it when I don't want to wear a bra, to exercise, to sleep.
B00F13N8TQ|5|I didn't know if I'd like the quality of this sweater.  After receiving it, I tried it on and it fit me very well.  I am 5'2&#34;.  The color is as pictured and the material is very soft and fairly thick for cold days.  I'd wear it over a turtle neck.
B0029LIAXC|4|i love the colors-super bright and fun. will look really cute layered with different tops. the ends of the sleeves and the bottom of the top do tend to roll up.
B00IMRUJE0|5|I love the softness of the fabric, the shirring at the bottom, and the way the garment is designed at the shoulders.<br />Wonderful garment, highly recommended.
B00DZI12MO|5|I have had these for 2 weeks and they are amazing. Great feel on the outside and the touchscreen feature works excellent.
B005PKPN1Q|1|Just washed this for the first time- had to soak in cool water to remove the stain.  After a new hours the water was pink from running dye.  I've kept it in the water for a day just to see what would happen and all of the little hearts are running now- I am afraid to put it in the washer.  Too bad, it looked cute.
B00A4SPTK4|4|This is exactly what I expected it's just a little big. But I would still buy again.
B00P3NCGXI|5|The top is a little big but is pretty!
B0012VS08K|5|I love these jeans. I know that every woman seems to have at least one problem with clothes. Mine is that I have a larger front (stomach) and a smaller back (butt).  For someone like me, these jeans are perfect.  I think it's partly because they stretch so they compensate for me. :)
B003VYFBMO|5|They seem expensive but they last and fit great. Only brand of socks I'll ever buy. They are also made in the USA and come with a 2 year warranty!
B001CCMPBM|5|This stretches and probably would fit most heads.  It looks great.
B00DV2VM2E|5|Just received them in the mail today! They fit good. I knew to order a size up, which was an XL. Just ever so slightly tight, but barely. I plan to fit them once I lose more weight, anyway. :B Great buy for the price!
B002JIO318|5|I bought this wallet to replace an old one I've had for years. I didn't think I would find an adequate replacement this easy, but this wallet fulfills all the needs I have. It has tons of slots for credit cards and business cards and the quality is outstanding. You can't go wrong with this purchase.
B00JK7PBT4|5|Ok
B00FDSTMD0|3|This is definitely a cool shirt for any fan of Iron Man, but there are a couple disappointments to take note of before buying one. The quality of the shirt itself is great but the graphic started peeling after the first wash. I bought this primarily for a Halloween costume so it's not too big of a deal to me. The other bummer, as commented by other people, is the size of the graphic. I ordered size large and the graphic is way too small for the shirt. It's deceiving in the picture of the sale listing.
B005CSNWJQ|5|Fits pretty good
B00H43E7H8|5|I absolutely loved the color and fabric of these, but sadly they were made for girls with more curves than me.
B0058SJSU2|5|Nice shirt. Good quality.
B00C7K8ATY|4|Not as dark as in the picture as I wanted it to be. Expected it to be a really dark burgundy but got a washed burgundy color
B001QUJX7E|1|Fit very small, product over priced
B002KB25SC|5|looks good
B00EDTOEUG|4|This is my first ever pair of jeggings and I'm so happy with the fit and comfort.  I ordered the size 16 and they're just a little big in the waist and shorter than most pants but since I wear them with boots, it's not a big deal. I'm 5'10&#34; so pants being short is just a part of life.<br /><br />I'd have given them 5 stars (or more if possible) if I could get rid of the smell.  I expect clothing that has been shipped to have an odor but after washing (according to instructions) they still have a lingering smell.  Almost like finger nail polish.  The smell keeps me from being able to wear them for a full day, bummer since I'd planned to wear them to school.
B00JJ1VT92|5|Its beautiful!!  Fitted exactly as expected!!  Very fast shipping.  Thanks for the great service.
B00HCTTM4C|2|It seemed to have been well made and would have been a bargain if it come even remotely close to fitting. I was just fitted at a tuxedo shop a couple of weeks ago. Other reviews said they ran small, so I ordered a size up and it was probably still 2 of their sizes too small.<br /><br />The seller was great and immediately processed my return.
B00CBSWH0K|2|To small for the size indicated, doesnt mach with 12 months
B002ZMOZAC|5|Every thing is great. I wish all things I order from places could be as efficient as Amazon.com.
B0006TZZQE|5|These Lollipop briefs are well made with a very soft but sturdy fabric. They are extremely comfortable with just the right amount of coverage. I love these briefs and consider them an excellent value!
B00LO9Y9EE|5|Excellent fit, very slimming and comfortable to wear, nice length.
B00YV5HX6E|4|Loving the dress
B00IUTGD90|5|It fits pretty true to size and it seems to be made well considering it's a costume
B00CKTH9BW|5|Gorgeous and beautifully-constructed.  He has lived in this handsome and heavy sweater ever since he opened it on Christmas morning....the Journey West design is unexpectedly hip for this forty-something CIO.  Pendleton, it is perfect in every way!
B00RMX11V0|5|It is just what I was looking for....I love it
B00DK9RIW6|4|Not bad. Thin material is comfortable but toes are not reinforced so will likely pop a hole soon. Also they run small. I have USA size 10 feet and they are just a bit small. Best for size 9.5 and smaller
B002XGZTB4|5|Purchased as a gift for best pal's 50th birthday... upon arrival (shipped directly to her in another state) I received a glowing, gushing THANK YOU for this thoughtful and indulgent gift. She was happy to receive these luxurious silk jammies and sent me another thank you the day she wore them the first time. Great product and OUTSTANDING service. Thanks!
B00ISI3YAO|1|I ordered an XL, and I'm a 36C.  The bottoms could fit a size 2, and there is no way the top will ever fit my chest.
B00BM3RBS8|4|Ordered this for someone else to wear. With the exception of the neck (which was too tight to close), it fit quite well!
B00E3P23OE|5|My friend loved this jeans the fit was perfect.  I would recommend theses also would buy other pairs if they came in different colors.
B00UDRS7AA|2|I ordered a size newborn and received a 9 month old size. By the time my LO can wear it will be winter..
B00NL0P57Y|5|Overall Great!!!
B0007USNRA|5|I have been professionally measured for bras, and I keep ordering the size they gave me (and I remeasure myself when I lose weight/etc) and it seems like most of the companies have NO IDEA how to make a bra that is true to size. I spend hours in the store trying on bras, and it never works out. This bra seemed to have a decent rating and I've needed a convertible or strapless for a long time now to wear with my bandage dresses, so I thought why not?<br /><br />Most strapless bras are oppressive at the top, shaping your breasts into little pear shapes that poke out and it looks totally unnatural. This bra has enough give at the top that it just gives a little lift without shoving them together or putting them in my neck. Just enough padding.<br /><br />I've been wearing it for about an hour and I barely notice it. Its incredibly sturdy, nice thick straps in the back.<br /><br />Absolutely exceeds my expectations. I'll be buying more.
B00L5IMXLK|2|Got them fast.  Not true to size. I also ordered them bigger size and still tight. I just wanted an easy nice loose fitting pant for around the house. Didn't get that.
B004I9785Y|2|Looked cheap
B00DR1EZ8M|5|Where has this belt been my entire life?  Simply the best belt I have owned.  The buckle is quality.  The belt construction concerned me but it has held up the first couple weeks really well.  The holding mechanism is really solid, doesn't slip at all even when buckled down tight
B0084ZAU8U|4|I really liked this, but decided to return it and purchase a vintage Burberry off eBay. The HSM trench has a zip out liner, which will keep you warm in the colder months. The craftsmanship is also solid, and it has a classic look. It runs about 44.5&#34; in length, which was too long for me, resting about 6 inches below my knees. The current style for trenches is shorter length, above the knees.
B00DU8QEYU|5|Took this to Key West with me, flaunted my stuff on the beach and let me tell you what. I've never had more compliments and any other beach attire I own :)
B000VK3UGK|1|I really believe the product I received to be a counterfeit. The quality of tailoring and the fabric was poor. The fit was poor and not equal to one I have from Glamorise by the same name and type.
B00FSKI1GW|5|love it
B0045H0L1W|4|My kids love these lights. The thing is that the finger holder comes off very easily.
B001NMLQX4|3|I had a blue pair of 180s from years ago and wanted to get a black pair.  I like them but they don't seem to fit as well as my old ones.  I am pleased with the quality.
B00QK2J7Z6|5|I purchased this sports bra one size larger than I ordinarily would purchase in regular bras because all the sports bras I have purchased in the past have been super small and way too tight. However, I imagine this bra would have been OK at the smaller size, because the material used in this bra is really wonderful. Much higher quality than most sports bras. Either way, it fits well.<br /><br />I also did not purchase the bra for high impact sports activities. I find a sports bra comfortable for everyday wear and for yoga and other low impact activities. It does not bind up or ride up. It stays in place very well.<br /><br />This is now my favorite bra by far. Very good quality, excellent and comfortable fit. I just bought a second one, I was so pleased.
B000JS3BCM|1|I thought i already reviewed this POS. I wasnt expecting much at all but it wasnt even practical. The only way i see this fitting on anyone, is if there mouth is completely deformed. worst Halloween product ive ever wasted my money on
B006YXOJ9A|5|I love this shirt saving grace is a dope band the shiping came in on time and it fits nice its worth the money 😊
B00OLUTSXA|5|This little outfit looks absolutely adorable. Colors are true to the picture and the fabric feels very comfortable. I will say that the leggings were actually much longer than I expected.. Maybe my kid is just short for her size.
B0030IMZ3Y|4|These jeans are close to exactly what I've been looking for. I have hated shopping for jeans since the popularity of the low, low waist and propensity for one's panties to show the moment one bends over a little! These are slim fitting, but not tight and stay where they belong (mid rise, just under the waist) with absolutely no GAPPING! They may run one size smaller than expected (probably because of the slim fit) so take this into consideration when ordering. I usually wear a size 2 or 4 regular in GAP jeans (depending on the style), but need a size 6 medium in these Levi's for a perfect fit. Hard to find all the colors I want (wish they offered them in black), but well worth the effort to look. May be a bit over priced for the quality of the denim (what ever happened to real denim weight material?), but it's nearly impossible to find jeans which are 100% cotton any more. Overall I am very satisfied and now have six pair of 525 Straight Leg and six pair of 525 Boot Cut jeans. Essentially, I live in jeans!
B00862DEWA|5|Following the recommendations of the people was perfect order
B002QGKX8K|1|Product arrived in poor condition, the vinyl covering was peeling off and the foam under coat was turning to dust. I will not buy from this supplier again. They don't check the quality of the products that are shipped to their customers. I buy a new product, I have the expectation of receiving a quality product.
B007M61482|5|Extremely comfortable and longer than many pants listed as &#34;36 L.&#34; I'm tall and thin and I can wash and dry these without worrying that they will shrink and look like capris.
B003ILE9WS|3|The material, color and fit were perfect. I could tell they would stay up on my waist and I would have to be pulling them up all the time. BUT they are not opaque. I want to wear whatever shirt I want without folks seeing my bum.
B0067WOXPS|3|With the three-pack, the waist is not what's pictured.  It's actually the same waistband shown in the bigger package.  I probably should have expected that but didn't- I'm not a fan of that waistband, in my experience it doesn't hold up well.
B00NX767OK|5|love my new pj's<br />super cute!
B008S9895S|4|Dickies are inexpensive,  tough and look respectable.  I wear black and khaki Dickies as professional work wear , sometimes with a tie and sport coat.  My dad wore them 60 years ago as a refrigeration engineer.  My only complaint is that the fabric is very stiff.  It softens with age,  but slowly.  it's part synthetic and the color lasts, but I learned bleach on a black pair can take the color out.  That's a common sense thing and my silly error.
B00CMB7382|4|I got a 2x when I am in a 1x so I am glad I sized up one they do fit very snug but I love the fact that they go all the way down to the ankle.
B00JWSPEUC|5|Cute shirt.....my grandson loves it!!!!
B004HSQVZE|5|Great colors as pictured. Promises to fit well and will be a great dress for summer evenings. Good price.  Good packaging.  Arrived in condition promised.<br />Arrived ahead of schedule. I am pleased with this product and its delivery.
B00GWF837Y|5|great pair of jeans
B008LXYSXS|4|Nice
B00NB77LN8|5|Fun and exciting
B00ZREQ1D4|5|This comb is absolutely beautiful! I was surprised to see how heavy it was (in a good way) and is very well made. Well worth the money and the wait. Thank you Woo!
B0002TORXU|3|Glad to find some cotton socks, they are getting harder and harder to find and I don't wear synthetic fabrics. These are large though, hoping they will shrink.
B003N9BW0C|2|Cup Size Correct Fit however the width of the bra was very wide. Being short waisted it felt strange for the bra to cover more of my ribcage than other similiar style bras. Returned for refund. Prime Item
B00MYZ1HGK|4|Very nice short, great fit and color.  They aren't a trendy short, just basic Bermuda style short.  I am 5'4, 148 lbs and curvy and size 10 fit perfect.
B00J8EFWC0|4|nice
B00AREIY3E|1|Returned these..way too large a fit..felt like I was wearing a shirt that was 2 sizes to big..other than that the pattern was nice.
B00M0WBAW8|5|At first looking at the reviews for this product I was a little nervous buying them .... I received them super early and its really good quality legging and it really comfortable defiantly recommend this product for moms to be !
B005GSRZAE|5|I love these earmuffs. They are warm and fit in your coat pocket. They are just what I needed in Michigan when it is -35 degree's
B0073VBGSY|5|nice  one
B00C9287DO|4|Just what I was looking for . Husband liked very much. Thanks
B00E8ZPNU0|5|Birthday gift for  8 year old grandaughter she loves it  & it fits nicely. She loves the monkey! thank you
B000N8X560|5|Order 2xl and long -- just a little too long on the legs but otherwise fit great -- seems that most need to be ordered a size larger to fit over clothes. Fits and functions great.
B00A65Z8RO|5|I absolutely love the shirt
B00QXAEB10|5|cute as ever and would recommend to everyone
B00D5I1PT4|4|Good fit
B001DNEE14|5|I used this wig for a Barbie costume. This wig is true to the picture in all aspects. The color is light and shiny, but not too shiny. It came very nicely packaged, complete with a net to keep it tangle free and a nice box. The straps to fit it perfectly were great. It didn't shift all night.  The only thing I would keep in mind is that it's less flattering on people with short foreheads (as I figured out) and the part is meant to be off to one side.
B000N8RY3K|1|I got the right size but they didnt fit! Still have not gotten credit t my account!!!! Got ripped off. Ill pass the word on t my friends!
B002ZAU9Y0|5|Very well made. i love the coin purse I'm hard on my wall an this one stand up to heavy use.
B00HSYXPN0|5|For me it was a five star because I gave it as a gift to one of my patients parents who has a Boston. The look on her face...priceless!
B00LUIMBN0|3|It's pretty obvious that you photoshopped yourself. And it's badly done.....
B00KJXP81Y|5|I ordered from the measurements given and this dress is a little roomier than I expected by the other reviews. Either way, it's a super cute dress and totally worth the money. It's well stitched and made and the fabric feels really smooth and soft against your skin. I bought a black petticoat to go with it to fluff out the skirt a bit and it looked great with a thin black belt at the waistline to cinch it in and give the dress some definition. I'd definitely buy this again if I could go back in time and do it all over again.
B005DSLY90|4|This is a uniform shirt no more no less. I purchase from Amazon because of the lateness in the year. My grand daughter's size changed since Sept. so new uniforms were required. Thanks Amazon !!!
B00HBK3HC0|5|It was a gift.  Recipient loves it
B007T3VOXS|5|My girls wore these for Halloween~ they were Starbucks Frapps
B00JFSBWIM|3|Polked holes in hose first time.
B000HDMRBA|5|I bought this t-shirt for my teen age son so that he could channel his inner wolf.  Since he started wearing the t shirt he has become a more dominant alpha male. As he put's it &#34;the ladies love it&#34;.
B00CMST6NK|1|This backpack fell apart after about 2 months of use.  Amazon, Newbury comics and Bioworld are all giving me the run around about replacing it.
B0006SCZQ8|5|the shirt fits fine, the cuffs could be a little bit larger around for us men that have large hands and wrist
B000FEC8WO|5|I get really hot throughout the day wearing my uniform in the southern heat. These kept me surprising cool/dry throughout the day.  The price is definitely worth it.  I will be slowly replacing my old FTLs one at a time.  Also Being taller for my weight (skinny), they don't fit as long as the picture shows.  Something I didn't even realize until I tried them on.  Being a 30-31 I should've  went for the bigger waist.
B00B1STOA2|5|I read he reviews, many said it was cheaply made and wouldn't last. I beg to differ, this hat is the same quality as the much more expensive ones. It feels as though it is felt covered plastic because of its stiffness. It is very sturdy, well made, silk lined and as described by the seller and above ALL, it looks GREAT!!! I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. My little one year old daughter got a hold of it and put through the ringer and threw it down concrete steps when she was done (mommy was taking to a friend's house) and it came out fine, dusted it off and put it back on my head. It is WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!
B002BMCWQA|5|Our boy lives in joggers and cargo pants and shorts, so I was surprised when he chose these shorts. He wanted something a little more dressy for a family party we attended. He looked so grown up and cool with these shorts and a golf polo.these shorts wash well and look fresh and new after drying.  Little guy is growing up!
B000QW6LE6|4|I have the squeem vest, which I am a big fan of, so I decided to try this cincher for strapless tops and dresses.  It does a great job of nipping in your waist and giving you an hourglass figure.  I love the result and I love that it hooks up the front because I think it's easier to put on compared to other styles.  The only downside is this tends to give you upper back fat, but that happens with every cincher I've ever tried.  If you aren't wearing strapless tops, go with the vest version because it helps prevent upper back fat.
B00CHJ0VAG|5|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. It is wearing very well considering I wash it at least once a week. Fits true to size.
B00PJ86F34|5|I will definitely make all my future slipper purchases Gold Toe. These are so soft and comfortable! The sole is rubberized to keep you from slipping. Slipper is completely flat so you almost have the comfort of being barefoot.
B003KQ696A|4|This is a pretty good and warm hat.  It will keep your head warm.  Fit is good for a normal headed person.
B00C3TJKD4|5|love it
B008G7O0FU|3|gives new meaning to tall, way longer then expected
B00CZCA7F4|4|Love the coat, the colour, feels great on. I'm 5'2, 100 pounds a bit bigger than what I would really like but don't get that easily so fit is as expected.
B00THGVKX4|3|Does not fit well in the bust area.
B00R6CBR5M|1|Cute but cut so small my granddaughter couldn't wear it. Was not expensive so I didn't even bother to send it back. Just beware that if you buy this you will need to size up.
B00ACIGUBI|5|I love them.  Cheap and top notch quality for the price you get them at.
B005EJGUAG|3|I got these b/c they were advertised as more of a mid-rise jean. They were still too low giving a muffin-top look. I LOVED the fabric and stretch. These jeans will NOT bunch up and will look great with boots. I am saying that they are somewhat small b/c I got the same size as my other jeans and these were too small and gave that very unattractive creasing just under the tush that you get when the jeans are too snug. I wonder, though, if these jeans are more true to sizes and the other jeans are giving you bigger jeans for a smaller number. I've lately thought that might be a marketing ploy to get us girls to buy more b/c we can &#34;fit into the smaller size&#34;. However, the other jeans are Calvin Klein, Lucky brand and Miss Me. So, three different brands all with the same size and great fit. Just something to keep in mind when buying. A size up might have helped with the muffin-top business, but the rise still felt too low. I am usually a size 4 or 27 and pretty slim but a mother of 5 and over 40... so a higher rise is a MUST. Can someone please produce the perfect rise jean without making a pair of &#34;mom jeans&#34;?
B00CLVEBTM|1|i bought these socks for my friend and they do not fit his feet at all (they were to small), it was a waste of money. He wears a size 9 and the package said 10-11 and they were to tight.
B00HDA2NZK|4|the body is large but the feet are small. Hopefully it will fit my son when he's born
B00U336MZQ|4|The large fits well over my bra (36D) but I wish the cups inside were removable. Not sure how it will wash, I'll most likely have to do it by hand. Pretty cute under tops.
B00KMAKVXE|3|Love lace shirts but this fits weird but the fact that I have 2shirts of beautiful color  makes up for the weird fit.
B0050N01WO|1|Far too small.
B004A7YLPY|5|Best wallet I've purchased.
B00GR9MINK|1|I bought this shirt for my son in 3t which is usually big for him.  After one wash it fits him like 24 month clothing fits. The green has a bluefish tint to it as well. I would not buy this shirt again. It is overpriced for such poor quality.
B00A7KMABU|5|Very comfy shorts. I use them for workouts and for lounging around the house. Love the longer length, can be worn up around waist or rolled down if you prefer. Lightweight and breathable. Good buy for the price.
B00K9QA2GC|4|Shipper forgot to include tag. Hat is very nice and as pictured.
B005J29O7E|5|These jeans were ordered after losing some weight, and I am so excited...they fit perfectly, very comfortable, and look great!!! I do recommend these jeans.
B00G1YSUS8|5|It was great, I got a lot of comments. I wear it all the time, the color is so vibrant
B00NTP06P2|4|It is very warm with the nice lining
B00O8WQR7G|5|It's hard to find scrubs that fit me.  I'm barely 5 feet and about 105 lbs, dress size around 00, so I'm more on the petite side.  The only scrubs I found at Scrubs and Beyond that fit me (without looking like I was wearing a potato sack) were the Grey's Anatomy scrubs in XXS Petite.  I took a chance on these pants because of the Prime free shipping/returns.  And I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />They are EXACTLY like Grey's Anatomy scrubs without the $30 price tag!<br /><br />Ultra Soft isn't as soft as Grey's, but it is soft enough and doesn't feel stiff and polyester-like.  The flat front and elastic back half prevents me having to raise and re-tie my pants throughout the day.  (The drawstring is more for looks.)<br />I bought these pants to replace my Grey's pants in this wine color.  And you can't tell that the pants aren't Grey's even when I wear the Grey's scrub tops.<br />In conclusion, if you like Grey's Anatomy scrubs, get these instead!
B00AOBP3XE|5|This beautiful belt fit perfect! I weight about 145 lbs., ordered the M/L, and it fits perfect! Very stylish! And the best price I have seen anywhere!
B005CSOM36|5|Champion does it again soft, comfortable and  perfect fit
B00382E6SO|4|Great quality. Fits great and he loves the designs.
B000B5GU1M|5|I spend ALOT of time outdoors, and religiously wear a hat to ward off the sun, rain, bugs,, etc.  I ordered this hat and absolutely LOVE it!!!  1st, it is comfortable. Very comfortable.  2nd, I love the neck shield, but if I don't want to look like a TOTAL tool, I just tuck the flap up into the hat.  it fits perfectly and doesn't make it too tight.  But again, the sun shield can also be a rain shield, as I found out yesterday...I was out for a run when it started to downpour.  I took the shield out, and voila, the rain ran right down it off my neck.  Third, because I am very active while wearing this hat, it has a sweatband around it, adding to the comfortability.  The shield looks longer and heftier than the pic.  So if you are looking for a protective head covering, this is it.  It doesn't heat up my head in higher temps, have yet to use it in the cold.  Hubby was jealous....looks like I am purchasing him one also
B00HS7QHQE|5|Best
B003E8XNQ8|1|Maybe I subconsciensly overlooked the \\"two part mask\\" statement because I wanted so badly to believe the part where it says \\"HELMET\\"  IT IS NOT A HELMET.  it is a cheap, thin, two part mask that is tethered together by elastic.  In fact, when it comes, it come back to front in a blister pack.  I expected it to be a helmet style piece that would go over the head and coudl be set up for display.  I couldnt of been more wrong.  This is like those old style 70s halloween masks I used to have as a kid, with a back piece.  Dont be fooled, know what your getting.
B00AMF0M6U|2|This suit is great but I had an issue with the crotch zipper.  Suit covers well and protects from the sun as advertised.  What you cannot tell from the picture and description is that is has a zipper in the crotch (forms an upside down U from inner thigh to inner thigh).  The zipper is bulky compared to the surrounding flimsy swimsuit material and might be irritating for some kids.  It is useful to change a wet diaper without having to completely peel off a wet swimsuit.  Unfortunately, the crotch zipper split on our suit the first day of use which was pretty disappointing considering the cost.  We managed to get it to zip back together correctly, but it is no longer functional.  I hope this was just a glitch with our suit and not an overall issue.  I would recommend this with five stars if it wasn't for the zipper issue.
B00A3QM0NG|5|It looks good, it's very comfortable, and I get compliments when I wear it.  What more could any one want?
B008XCNU5E|5|Very soft leather and warm.  Fit perfectly.  I ordered size XL for my husband who has large hands. He loves them.
B00009951Z|5|Heyy! I am new at this kind of stuff, but still when i see a sim suit i want i dont change my mind about it and i want this swim suit and yall dont have the top and the bottom are out of of stock! And my question is when are yall going to be getting it in. I would love it if u would notify me when yall get another xs or small in. My email is im_slow_and_proud@yahoo.com and if your wondering im 13
B00DTVEI6Y|5|Stylish and pretty bra!! Love it!
B0060C920Q|4|was surprised that it was brown thought it was going to be black
B004KP9FRA|5|All I can say is, they are great
B00BVJZZ2W|5|Great
B00E8XDUHK|5|Love them
B0084A8H12|5|He wears it all the time. The shirt arrived just as described. He thinks it's awesome! Granted, no one over 12 knows who Annoying Orange is... but kids seem to think it's funny.
B00CH1ZLLI|4|giving to husband as christmas gift
B00J0A50HE|1|DIDNT LIKE THE MATERIAL, DRESS LOOKED CHEAP
B00IXXPD1C|3|Nice jacket but it came with many wrinkles set into the lining which showed through on the outer jacket. Also it was a bit too yellowish-cream as opposed to off white. The yellowish hue made it look a bit cheap.  Fits true to size but could have been a bit more fitted and tapered at the waist area.
B004HB3942|1|Short, small and tight. These went back immediately. Not stretchy and the inseam was really short. They are high quality but they were too short and too tight. Definitely order a size or 3 up.
B004SCX3BO|5|Another Mithcell & Ness snapback reveiw from me! I feel as if I have reveiwed every team & every style of M&N Snapback hat that they have come out with! I have bought a ton of these hats for my honey because he loves them so much! Mitchell & Ness is by far his prefered brand. They wear well, & seem to have a much better selection of teams & styles than other brands. Also they are priced about mid range as far as hats go. Not cheap but not to expensive either! We Love Hockey!!
B001KNXUF8|5|I bought this for my grandson who is getting into wearing bow ties. He wore it and got rave reviews from his friends. It is a quality pre-tied bow tie and very convenient especially for a person just starting out to wear bow ties.
B007E9S9Z8|5|I love the shorts and they fit perfect and I received the package on time.
B00DW7O7XO|5|Love this dress!! It fits perfectly, doesn't wrinkle, and is so comfortable, it feels like an oversized t-shirt....and it looks very classy and chic!  I ordered the Medium and it fit just right (I'm 5' 6&#34;, 38&#34;-29&#34;-34&#34;)...hits right at my knees, and is a bit loose through the waist and hips, but I expected that as I'm kind of busty. The waist was just right on me, but I'm short-waisted and long-legged. I wore it to work last night and got tons of compliments on it, starting with my husband the moment I put it on, and it just kept going all night. It has that retro &#34;Mad Men&#34; kind of look - people were joking I just needed a martini in my hand. This is definitely my new favorite dress - effortless comfort while looking fabulous is a great combo!
B00TB2EG62|4|Good color and strong stitching.  Ran a bit larger than advertised.  I already planned to taylor the paints, so will not have to taylor the jacket too.
B003DCYQ3O|5|This amazing wrap is great to wear while doing Zumba or a night out on the town.  It is very light weight and well made.
B00DC68786|5|The item was fabulous it had all the qualities I was looking for, warmth, comfortable, soft & most of all it is a &#34;fashion piece&#34;.
B004DNVOVY|5|Great bathing suit. Very comfortable. The only thing I'm not crazy about is tha pockets fill with water and don't drain quickly. I wish they had small holes in the pockets.
B00CQ3DQ28|5|I'm about 5'1&#34; and the small fits perfectly. Great cut -- not too form-fitting but sits snugly on my waist.
B007JBA166|1|They shrink after washing as per their instructions. Not true rip stop material. Don't buy.
B0034G65RO|1|The item pictured is not what I got. I ordered three packages of these panties wanting mostly the white and black panties. I got a multi-colored printed 4 pack and each four pack were identical. I would not have ordered these if I had known I was not getting the colors I wanted... Very upset.
B00IY7NQMK|5|Got a thousand and one compliments for this at work. Even though im the only male nurse
B00DZEZ1QG|4|I love the material and the weight of the robe even though it runs a little large.
B00509BY8I|1|Liked the belt at first, The clasp lost traction on the web belt after a month.. Buckle fell off. Still looking for a decent work belt.
B00DQ4PIOU|5|I love this jacket!  It's perfect for walking here by the ocean!  Great to keep in the car for when I need it.
B004TD5HLQ|3|I ordered this to go with my steampunk outfit I had for an Anime Convention. It looks good but is too big. It says on the cardboard &#34;men's&#34;, which I must have missed somewhere in it's description. But it was even to big for my guy friend.  I ended up pinning it to my jacket and had it dangle about. It let me twirl it in my hand occasionally. But you can't where it for the look. Best to say, it's really good for a prop. Wish it was smaller. Nice leather cord it had come with.
B00A4LPE7Y|5|Fits great in the body. Sleeves are a tighter cut than usual but I like it.
B00ATLFXCU|5|Fit perfectly. Plenty of room if you're a DD. It fits like it was custom made and the quality is superb. It is flattering and absolutely beautiful. I received so many complements. Someone said I looked like Audrey Hepburn. What more can a girl ask for! I love it.
B002ZENMBI|4|It is a solid protection of your head and ears in cold and windy winter. But after long time using, it does not look good as it has little yarn balls.
B000QY6LBM|4|Thick material, true to size, and looks great.  My husband purchased the brown ones from a local store and later wanted another color but the store didn't sell them anymore.  So I found them here on Amazon and got the Moss colored shorts.  These ones here on Amazon were thicker than the other ones he purchased elsewhere leading my husband to believe the other ones were probably knock-offs.  He's very happy with his new shorts and will likely buy again if Amazon ever adds another color in the 38&#34; waist.  Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.
B00ETC7CM4|3|My little girl (3 yrs. old) was so excited to get this set for Christmas. She wore it for the first time one recent bitterly cold night. The hat was so incredibly annoying as it kept coming off her head. It's made small and with no strap, it just didn't stay on.
B00KQQX8AW|5|I ordered this as a surprise for my husband and he loves it! We have washed it several times and the logo hasn't cracked or faded. Great product!
B00GM7CQBG|5|It came pretty fast and fits nicely.
B0045G1XH4|5|excellent quality and gorgeous coat. My husband always wears a medium, but not in this coat. Could not even get arms in sleeves. Very tight through shoulders. Returned item, and if reordered will try an extra large. He is 5'10' and weighs about 175.
B00TQ0D2VY|5|This shirt was just as I hoped. I wore it on the white water rafting trip to keep me from getting sunburn. It kept me cool and I did not get sunburn. Love it
B00CHHCD9K|3|Everything is ok but a flaw on the back of pants.<br />It seem that i can not upload a photo here.
B00KPP6W2U|5|Curve hugging and cute. The light purple is heathered, so it is a bit casual, but still sexy!<br /><br />I will buy more colors for sure!
B00LP8FP7Y|5|Fit perfect. Suit was adorable.
B00K5AFQ22|5|Great wallet. Great quality. I've always preferred slim wallets like this. I used to use a Backsaver chiropractic wallet, but it wore out and I bought this. I love the easy access to my cards. I used to literally split my finger beds open fishing out cards from the card sleeve but this solves that. I was skeptical if it would work well, but it works great. The fabric lining in the pockets allow the cards to just slip up when you pull the cord. It's great!
B00CSLXOZW|3|This belt looks good and stylish. However, the description is a bit misleading. It says it's \\"full grain\\" leather but it's stamped very clearly on the inside with \\"genuine leather\\". I was specifically looking for full grain.Also it's made in China. I didn't see anywhere on the site saying it was made in China but if I had I would not have purchased it. I would have preferred US or Italian made.<br />Over all, the belt looks, feels and smells good. I hope it lasts.
B00LZPT86G|5|Great bag! The size is perfect .. Very well made.
B0048BPK02|5|The shorts fit perfectly and are super comfy. I love the color<br />The price was good on amazon<br /><br />thank you very much
B00TF1WJSQ|5|this is definitely one size fits all. I wear XL  and this still had some room. I wont be wearing it as a beach cover up though. Just as a kimono over my tank tops
B00ES4NIQM|3|The compression shirt is somewhat too small.
B006X7PPTK|4|looks pretty
B0072IHTIO|4|It's just a little small for me. I bought this for a cosplay for an anime convention coming in 7 weeks. It's not so small that it's uncomfortable. I had hoped to meet a good part of my weightloss goal by now. But I will keep this great coat nonetheless, and use it.
B000N8TK3M|5|The blue denim bibs were above my expectations for my husband.  They were a soft material, and true to size.  He was so surprised to see them as a special gift, other than for a birthday or Christmas.  I had not been able to find bibs in Tucson anymore, and this was wonderful ordering them through Amazon.Com.
B00NFY6SQI|4|I loved it, but it was to big. It didn't stop me from wearing it...
B00DULOG0G|4|Fits perfect!!! I purchased the navy, hot pink and red one and the colors are perfect.  Love it!
B00CXOMR8O|5|My husband wore this for a Halloween party while I was She-ra.. Talk about a blast attack! I got the XXL and after a couple of adjustments (He didn't feel comfy so we had to add material to the torso) It fit perfect! He wears size XXL in tops and he's wears a 40 in pants. I gave the wig some much needed shape with the hair dryer on low and voila! No complaints..
B00L63DKZM|2|The jacket itself is a very good quality jacket . . . it just didn't fit, even though I specified my size according to Nautica's size chart.  It was much too small, even though the label indicated my size.  Either Nautica's sizing &#34;runs small&#34; or this particular Jacket was mis-labeled.
B00CIQFDO2|3|Great fitting dress. Colour also stands out but the quality of the material used has somehow failed this dress. After using this for the first time, the front seems to have a few visible threads. E.R
B008PZM7SA|5|I had a breast augmentation 3 months ago after breast feeding my two kids and was told I don't need a lift if and only if I wear a supportive bra night and day. Padding makes me look like a porn star and it's so hard to find a supportive bra for my narrow shoulders. This bra is by no means sexy, but it's comfortable and plastic surgeon approved! I'm<br />Very petite and non adjustable bras just don't fit or support my new twins. This bra is perfect for sleep or leisure wear. I am a 30/32 D now, and the small is perfect.
B00KDC7BR0|5|Fit as expected.
B003VWFWLQ|5|A great buy. I have seen this wallet listed as high as $50. It is clean, holds a lot of cards, and it was shipped quickly and arrived on time.
B0048LMHD0|4|Good
B00KIZQ6HI|5|My dad loved this he got emotional when he saw it.
B007M4EWLU|5|I love this dress. I am tall (5' 10\\") and the hem still hits at the ankle. The vertical stripes are really slimming, the fabric is smooth and flowy (it doesn't look bulky like some maxi dresses can), and it is super comfy.
B007CVURW6|5|This dress is phenomenal! I have never bought anything online and not had a single complaint until this dress!! The fabric is not as shiny as silk but has an elegant sheen to it..makes me feel like a million bucks walking on the red carpet. I bought marchite green which is more of a dark teal...absolutely gorgeous color on pale or dark skin!! I wish I took pictures while i tried it on but I was so excited to write this review I took it off and sent it to dry cleaners to get steamed. My measurements are 34-27-37 and I got a 4. The bottom is flowy while the top accentuates bust and waist. Buy it!!! I love it so much I am going to make my bridesmaids wear it!
B007JA9TH4|5|My daughter wore this for her 2nd Halloween. I figured it would be perfect for our Trick-or-Treat because it's usually freezing. Unfortunately, it was 80 degrees out that evening but she still looked cute!<br />The head of this costumed is detached so it makes it a little uncomfotable for her. Once we were outside a while, she stripped it off pretty quickly!
B009VK6ISI|5|Love the look full and thick fur looks so real it keeps you warm from wind and cold. I plan on buying other in different colors I wear.
B00JJOSZ78|5|I chose this rating  because I really love this shirt! The design is great and comical. This is an intended gift for my boyfriend who loves nerdy stuff like this! You all should come out with some hoodies of this too! Would definitely purchase a hoodie with this print. thanks so much! Highly recommended!
B009YR652C|5|Love the style and fit!
B00DV0UK1A|3|But the neck is too small
B007ZJM6LK|5|Perfect for the price.
B00BCUPOSU|4|Most of my jeans are Lee.  I am 57 and do not like the low-rise jeans that younger women seem to prefer.  Lee is one of the few brands I can find locally and sometimes online, and many of their styles are suitable for women who don't want half their behind sticking out of the top of their jeans.  Kohls and JC Penney carry Lee, but sizes are limited and inventory often missing my size.<br /><br />I ordered this pair from Amazon having just bought the same SKU number from JC Penney.  The Amazon jean fits the same (great) in hip and waist in size 6... But the jeans are nearly 2 inches shorter.  They may have been mislabelled since Lee makes a short, average, and tall version.  But they work when wearing flip flops so I'm keeping them.
B009D3ZSDO|3|If your buying for a girl the size is right on.  Because of the comments I read I bought a medium sized suit.  I almost wise I would have ordered a small.  I haven't had to wash it yet so time will tell.  Other than that it was great!
B0011MWEE6|5|I'm a 36H and this is the only nursing bra I found that fit comfortably. I have it in a few colors and love it. I've used Anita bras for 3 kids now and will use them again if the time comes!
B000OX010W|5|These socks are actually extra wide as described. They are a nice thick material. This brand was worth the price tag we paid for them. They fit perfectly.
B000A821N6|3|The top is too small and the bottom is too big. But I made it work with a cardigan and some safety pins
B002FK8BRM|1|BEWARE It would have been just okay (not much support) with the straps but without the straps it was a DISASTER. I was hoping the dress would keep it in place but it will not stay up. I ended up sitting instead of dancing.
B00NMSK1QU|5|This tank is great. Very flattering and the fabric is so soft. Two thumbs up!
B00QQ91332|1|took more than a month to delivery, i do not recomend this.
B00BZQZAW6|5|Get lots of compliments on the colour.  Probably would like it a bit shorter, am 5'4&#34; and think it would be better shorter but I get lots of compliments anyway!
B002PK0W1A|5|This is the best messenger bag I ever owned.  And I've been through a lot.  The material is soft, yet sturdy, the strap is comfortable, and there's plenty of pockets.  That's the best feature.  Seriously, I'm never fumbling for anything...ever!  A great find.
B0080B588A|1|BEWARE ! After going through the entire process of ordering, waiting, unpacking, trying on for size,repacking,requesting refund, downloading/printing a return label,driving to a UPS drop off center, and returning home ....I'm wondering if the entire process is worth shopping online at Amazon.com. This item wasn't even close to being the correct size. Others had complained but I gave Amazon the benefit of a doubt, however, This item, conservatively, runs A FULL TWO SIZES TOO SMALL. In addition, this item is not pre- shrunk, and being 100% cotton will shrink significantly !  Another unfortunate purchaser stated the plastic zipper will MELT in the dryer. A complete waste of my time and money. $100.00 IS NOT TOO MUCH TO PAY FOR QUALITY DOUBLE THICK 13 OZ.100% COTTON HOODIE .....BUT THIS IS NOT THAT ITEM !
B00KLV7KF6|5|Love this bra!
B0051D4RLO|5|Love the jeans...fit well..  The only issue is the usual one...the short length is too short and the medium length is way too long.  I'm 5'6&#34; tall.
B00KPUPPBY|4|These pants were true to the size.  I loved the fold over waist band.  You can dress these up or wear them causal.  The only thing I didn't like was that the pants legs didn't have a seam/hem at the bottom.  However its not very noticeable.
B00CA6V78G|3|This wash was cut differently from the others.
B00QEDNX42|4|I bought these for my son to wear as a base layer for snowboarding because I hate spending a lot of money on &#34;moisture-wicking, temperature  control&#34; thermal underwear that he outgrows in four months.  He said they helped keep him from being too cold, but not toasty.  I ordered a size 14/16.  He usually wears a 14 shirt and 14 slim pant.  The pants fit well.  The top was pretty tight and pretty short which he doesn't care for but he wears a regular t-shirt over the top anyway.  The material is comfortable.  His only complaint is that the shirt is so short.  Good value for the money.
B00LVPA0VC|4|This is a good quality jacket at a good price, but it runs a little small.  I purchased it a size larger than my son wears now in the hopes he could use it next year and it just fits him now.
B0083Q21BO|5|I'm not a big fan of turtlenecks, but when I saw this one on Amazon it looked really cute on the model so I figured I would give it a try and order one in my size. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />It fits perfectly for a size small and its long enough to wear with leggings and/or with a belt. Its versatile and can wear it as many different outfits. The turtleneck also accentuates my figure and bosom area which is nice ;)<br /><br />I'm thinking of buying another one in black.
B00LHZNEMI|5|I love this jacket, Exactly what I was looking for
B00IVII6GI|3|Not the quality I would have picked, runs on the small side. The metallic imprint of the skeleton bones does not show up well
B00WDEKCHW|4|Nice jeans but baggier than expected :( think I shall get the 30 length next time
B0046K2MRO|5|This was the perfect gift for my friend.  It shipped quickly and was a beautiful scarf! My friend loved it!
B003XD1BSG|5|This belt is wonderful. I like that it can reverse to the solid color that way he can wear it to more formal events and then reverse it to the skulls for every day use. It fits him just right. It was a little hard for him at first to reverse it himself but now he can do it.
B00HDA2NZK|4|Not as soft as I'd expected but still very cute and hopefully will be used soon. They look about the size of my daughter' sold newborn clothes & I know they'll fit if the baby isn't over 8 pounds haha.
B003HLS9B6|5|This shirt looks exactly like the one pictured, color is a nice deep brown. Scobby's face nicely done. Size true fit.
B009E3252A|5|Great product for Star Wars fans.
B00QVZNGW2|5|I really love this top!!  Its a beautiful color and fits so well that I don't have to worry about it falling off! It also gives enough coverage for my girls. :)
B00IYWJDC2|5|It took a little longer to get here than I expected, but the weather was a factor. I just love it!  It is a perfect fit, love the color and the price.
B004EK2NUC|5|These just arrived in great packaging.  This product is as lovely and vibrant as pictured  I bought three. I recommend this product and company.&#34;
B004ZDML9Q|4|GOOD!
B005O7J76W|5|Very stylish. Lots of compliments It appears to be good quality.
B00BFSBPU0|5|Comfortable and fit as expected.
B00WJZM67E|4|Super cute with a nice secure fit,..love the ladder back. Five stars just because the colors were neon pink and orange not the softer ones shown in the picture. An incredible value all the same.
B004V3HO2E|5|Exactly as described.  Very fast shipping.  Might have to send back and switch to a larger size.  I guess I really didn't understand the size chart, make sure you know for sure what size you need.  Take into account the belt buckle too.
B000WEGKU8|5|This was the best baby costume I have ever purchased and also the cheapest! I couldn't believe the quality. It even came with a real zipper. My small one-year-old looked adorable walking around in the costume.
B006SRTEZG|5|Nice
B0051D7TXW|5|As a loyal Dockers fan...I was hesitant to buy these pants on line. I've never worn Lee slacks before. They fit beautifully and are perfect for my office job that requires black slacks everyday. I'm finding it harder and harder to find pants in a 16 or 18 tall. Dockers has really scaled back on their inventory. Lee is my new go-to work pant. I loved the 1st pair so much I ordered 2 more. At almost half the price of Dockers...you can't go wrong!!! After a few rounds through my washer/dryer they have kept their color also.
B0073E5308|4|Good product for price.  It does show my ears a little but was still a hit at my function with shaved head and bulletproof vest I looked like bane.  When I walked in everyone knew who I was dressed as right away.  I have a large head :) 7 1/4 so was not too big for me.
B004ZWG0O4|5|Things are beginning to chill and moisten in the Pacific Northwest, so it's time to transition to my drysuit when kayaking, but not without a base layer.  This year I chose Calvin Klein, largely because the crotch isn't a maze of stitches.  What I wasn't expecting was the long length of the legs.  I'm 6'2&#34;, and I've got to pull them up!  Normally my pant layer is creeping up my calves, so this was a pleasant surprise.  The fabric is soft and hopefully of wicking quality.  The waistband is snug, but not restricting.  My waist is ~35&#34;, so the medium was the obvious choice.<br /><br />Come on winter!
B00R8SFYG2|1|Looked cheap
B0010W39QY|5|I want one in every color, doesn't fall and the band doesn't gouge in the back or roll. Stays in place.
B00QYTIVCU|5|I love these shorts, so comfy and functional!
B00332FW96|4|For a small man, this is great, but my husband has some meat to him and it was a bit short in the arms and he barely could close it, creating a need for a second, larger, robe. He really likes it though, the colors are sharp and clean.
B006MHCVYS|5|These gloves are really thick! I got both the left+right hand gloves... I was afraid of getting 2 of the same gloves based on other 2 reviews but they didn't mess up the order at all! Also fast shipping :) I would recommend these! The only thing I really see wrong is the little hook to attach the cover part =\ seems easily torn.
B00D6OZA9I|3|Poorly made. Glue on the fur side and the seams or cheap.. You get hat u pay for
B00A7G61AA|5|Awesome
B00GLJA5YU|1|I'm aware these were Asian sizes, but I didn't realize they were also from the kids section. I ordered two sizes up and they were too skin-tight to get on.
B00Q6EOYF6|5|Love them
B002R0FF7O|3|My daughter is a tall 8yo. These came with a picture of a toddler on the package. She managed to fit in them, but a bigger girl wouldn't fit. I think they are mislabeled.
B00JOOV27I|5|My 4 year old loved this nightgown! The sizing was spot on, and the quality is good. One thing to note, this is clearly a nightgown, but the sleeves are made of that itchy mesh/lace fabric, so sometimes she would complain about it being too &#34;scratchy&#34;. We ended up removing the sleeves, and now you can't get her to take the gown off!
B00GEQ9Y6U|5|Very nice shirt , im usually L and the M fits me perfectly.
B007G0Y5EY|5|Love it
B000U64M8A|5|Legs are too long, but they think because I'm fat, I must be over 6 feet tall
B00PT2FRFC|5|I love the fit hope you get more colors i am coming back for the nude.
B002U8XW9Q|5|Fits perfectly. The design is very detailed and awesome. The fabric is quite comfortable. I am very pleased with this purchase. Well worth the buy.
B00NHQ2XRC|5|bueno
B00EAATQVA|1|Fits good but cuter on here then in life
B0038OMDXM|4|This would have been 3 stars but I gave it 4 because I couldn't find any other company that makes onsies for older toddlers.  Otherwise, they shrink up a lot so I suggest buying at least a size larger.
B004QMLR00|5|Great for &#34;pretending&#34; to be the god of thunder!
B00IN0RACA|4|These T-shirts are just a little smaller than I'm used to for a XL tall - the length is about right. The shirts are very well constructed and fold straight, but the finish is a bit dull and just a bit rougher to the touch than most of my other shirts.  All things considered, (including the price), I'm satisfied with the purchase and will consider these shirts when I need more.
B006L3V6N0|4|Love the fact that they stay in place, but they run a little big and show in most of my shoes.
B003XFYR9Y|5|Love it! Was unsure about the fabric before I ordered,  but everyone was right. Great fit and very comfortable! Want more!
B004TCSG92|5|was exactly what was said in the description
B000ZJWGIA|5|You have to have a minimum count of words in these reviews, but I don't have too many words in me.  It's an excellent product, and I keep it in my pocket next to the gun.
B00EF54NXG|5|Excellent product . my daughter loved it.. would definitely buy again
B0095U8M6K|5|I am an Australian size 16 E and the 40DD fits me perfectly. The brown and navy were beautiful colors. Hard to find these colors in shapewear here in Australia.
B00DS2XN88|5|very comfy pant... keep their shape after many washings.
B0047EMASK|5|Came on time, and looked beautiful.  My sister-in-law loved it.  It would look great for the holidays or if you wear bright colors, any time of year.  Sparkly!
B002K6F7BE|2|This bra does not provide enough coverage. Often the breast pads I use to prevent leakage stick or fall out and sometimes even my nipples are exposed.
B00HD0OWRW|3|WAY too small...I have tiny girls and they jackets are way too small even for them.  And I bought bigger that their usual size so they could use them a couple of years.
B008JI5IAC|5|fits well for the recipient that I bought the tops for.
B00B450PUK|4|I like the way it works it expands well for my credit cards and money and only thing I don't like is the look on the inside is a little too tall
B00ESYX4O8|5|Love this hat.  The yarn is very soft and the quality is very good.  And it's warm - just perfect for the winters in Southern California.
B00MG28KQ6|1|this products fit was no where near realistic. I bought  as a gift for my daughter-5'9&#34; and 135 lbs-I got a medium and it was WAY to small. She cant wear them. :(
B001RTSCUI|2|I don't know how these Mediums would fit persons of sizes other than mine. I own t-shirts from very many manufacturers, all Medium, and they all fit fine. This Medium is far too small, and I've had to return the shipment.
B00GS18WMI|5|My daughter loved this shirt... lol, she wore it to school and loved the attention it brought her. Great product. It came in as great quality.
B00JCSX526|1|.I was so excited to get this it took like the longest time to come but i was very patient for it to come you know but the day it came (today) I got it and it was extra large. I am very upset because i got this maybe its the first time it happens. But i am just warning you guys.
B001GP07BA|2|I ordered up a size after reading the reviews. The band rolls badly, no way to keep it down. If you are extremely slender, it might work, but otherwise, watch out. The bra itself flattens you which is good for walking but not terribly comfortable. I will keep them for walking but that wasn't what I was looking for. Have ordered a leisure bra instead since I was wanting something comfortable to wear around the house. This isn't it.
B00KA8NBTY|3|I got the size I would usually buy but it ran way too small on me I don't think I'll ever get to wear it
B0049HJ7XQ|5|Loved it!!
B000G7BF2O|5|I am 6 feet 6 inches tall and have a hard time finding shirts long enough. This shirt is long enough and seems well made.
B0006I89KY|5|I'm going to purchase several of these. I love the material and the way the hip looks.
B0097DNHKG|2|it looks cheap and makes me look fat!  but i kept it, because i will keep it in my costume box
B00CIPIDKO|5|Really amazing quality shirt that offers great style, Pendleton quality, with washable fabric.  I own three of them and will buy more in the future, but they seem like they may last forever!
B00KOBJLI2|5|Bought this as a gift and he loved it
B00L3YGH04|2|It was not an XL. It looked like a medium.
B00DOI68R4|4|The tights certainly kept me warm.  They were a little tight, but OK..
B0038IDTMW|5|These briefs fit and conform to my body exactly the way I hoped.<br />They give just the right level of support and firming. Yet they don't<br />cut into your thighs and leave marks like others do. I highly recommend these<br />to anyone looking for a little firming without the pain!
B0044FN2ZW|3|Not as big as i thought. Its a fraction larger than a regular xl hat. Quality is so so. It looks kinda distressed cotton. But it is comfy.
B007XD6LI2|1|If your not a short Asian person the dressed by this seller will not fit you I'm only 5'4\\" and there clothing is still too small for me<br />If your not a 4 foot tall petite person it will not fit you ...very misleading
B00M1TIYZG|5|No more overheating with this puppy.  Has the look of an ugly Christmas sweater, but without the itching and sweating.
B0018OQQ82|2|button fly? Plus to long. Made in china I suppopse als all jeans are. Am going back to Rustlers again
B00GN3GN90|4|suit was delivered quick, but was too big. especially in the bust. had to return. return was super easy, tho!
B005J5FU4C|5|Love, love, love this item! They use American Apparel for their printing, which provides great quality. Their shipment was fast and when I had to return for a different size it was NO PROBLEM!<br /><br />Would purchase from them again :)
B009PVGOW8|1|Too large and and too much fabric.
B00INKAYN2|2|returned it - didnt look so great in person
B0045D98L0|5|This costume is so darn cute!! My little baby is adorable wearing it!
B00B9FKH94|4|❤️❤️
B0003DJD0W|5|After buying a number of clip suspenders, the Perry suspenders appeared on the scene.  There quality is obvious to others, as well.
B013MAT4MO|5|I got this absolutely beautiful coffee ring for my best friend who is an avid coffee drinker and she loves it!!! It fits her to a T. The ring is very high quality sterling silver and and comes shipped in a cute little ring box. The ring is exactly what we expected and we are thrilled with our purchase. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B0014GVO0Y|4|These are fun undies for a night with the one you love. Makes you feel sexy, naughty and ready for action!  I found it matches several of my current lingerie items.
B00DDEJ5BA|5|it's a bit bigger than expected but still perfect because a size smaller would have make way to much difference. Its beautiful and cozy, any whovian will love it
B000KGOK4G|4|Description should have indicated that product was preshrunk. The product was great as it was a good heavyweight cotton/polyester shirt but the description was lame.
B00M6P2NTS|1|Bad quality t-shirt.
B00VXS4QOE|3|Love the color.  The fit is snug, but, they are leggings after all. Just would have liked the material to be a bit thicker as these pants leave nothing to the imagination.  I had to return them.
B00KX673YW|1|i normally wear a size 12, this was a plus size dress and it still did not fit.  it would be more profitable to you all if you could adjust your sizes to American sizes if you want American women to purchase your clothes.  luckily I have someone that will enlarge the dress across the bust area and the arms.
B001OE0HKE|1|Bought the belt so I could attach a buckle I had that required a 1 1/4\\" wide belt. Belt is 1 1/2\\" Wide, it doesn't fit. Give the width of the belt as well as the length please. Poor Quality.
B00IMWKXVO|5|great
B00JSTLOPY|2|This is not a bra with a comfortable fit. I was self-conscious all night because I did not feell secure in the bra.
B00RG6ORQY|5|Good quality jeans. Nicely made. Nice design. Thick material yet light weight and comfortable. Nice high waist to cover your stomach and hips. Nice wash. Washes nicely, irons quickly and holds it shape. I ordered an xl large, and it fit kind of loose on me. I'm not sure what size number is the xl. Maybe a 14. I wear a US woman's size 12.
B00HDA3NZ4|3|Too light weight
B000YUYIT0|5|My little girl loves to look at the duckies on the pajamas and it is not too thick, so perfect for warmer weather.
B00M8IV7PE|4|good
B007Z36VDU|5|I love this blouse!  I am 142lbs, 5'3 and the medium size fits perfect on me.<br />What I love the most about it is the fact that it can be used as a blouse and as a mini dress.<br />As a blouse, it is very stylish!<br />As a mini dress it is very sexy!<br /><br />I strongly recommend this blouse to anyone
B00AMCF92U|5|Great
B00MEPUL7G|5|Got exactly what I wanted , my son is going to be so happy I found the Jersey he wanted .
B000OSKR6U|5|I like this style more than a baseball hat.  It fits better and provides for some air under the hat to help keep your head cool in the heat.
B00F0MHD2Q|5|OMG!  This dress is so pretty and elegant.  I always receive a ton of compliments when I wear it and get asked where I bought it.  I am 6&#34;1&#34; and it is perfect length for me.  The white bodice is lined and the zipper is down the back.  The quality of the dress is very good and I highly recommend buying it.
B004QIJ7II|5|Love it!  Fabric is soft and I love the fit.
B00NIN5UC4|4|Great ugly sweater. It won me the contest. Sleeves where a little small but it served its purpose for something I'm not going to where that much
B000ZN7582|5|Nice shirt, but material is a bit stiff and not soft as I expected.
B007H2UWD4|5|Not too shear, comfortable. Less over-sized than some. Washes and wears well. A bit shorter than some models, but below the knee of my 5'7&#34; frame
B00NYYJZGO|1|Usually a medium I ordered large just in case.  It was way too small.  I can't use it.  Plus the fabric is stated as wool but it's not.  It's polyester.
B00FFIQJRU|5|Fit just as expected, shipped fast! Good quality design
B009CCRK8C|4|They are sof and comfortable and priced well for what they are. Don't expect a custom fit wool sock for that price, but for a utilitarian sock, they are very good.
B007E6RUAG|5|LOVE IT
B006P0A2RU|5|After sampling several candidates, these Touch briefs were the clear winner for comfort and fit. The medium size was just right for me (31\\" waist). They're comfortable for general wear and they provide adequate support for vigorous exercise.
B00KQ7WS4I|5|Adorable pajamas and ultra soft. I haven't washed them yet but they are really cute.
B00KOF6BUO|5|Very good. thank your.
B00U90KMU4|5|Love it !! For weekends and play with my little boy !
B00IOF5FTO|4|Quality is good, fabric is hard and well, but size xxxl fit terrible, it's like a 8 regular size or м, Im 100cm bust and 100cm bottom and this swimsuit fits so tight! But it's beautiful and I will be in strong diet for this!))))
B00E3AJ6ZS|3|The fit is a bit small; my daughter is on the tall/slim spectrum though.  They look cute, kind of capri length.
B006IYR9SI|5|love it, love it , love it !!!
B00I94KSUQ|5|Great price great seller
B00FL3Z3OO|3|Band of lace could be wider.
B00794VIZ6|5|Im a busy doc between clinic and hospital and these work out great! Cargo style with lots of pockets! Washed a million times without fade or shrink.
B004I77BM6|5|I got a purple one and it's exactly what I wanted! I love just getting out of the shower and putting my robe on, and I'm happy about the quality & price!
B005CSOMHW|5|Great fit.
B00B3HURNY|5|This is a great multifunctional hat. It is lightweight and matches with all outfits. Gave a hat to my nephews (6 & 8). They put it on as soon as they received them and love them. It's brim protects against the sun.
B00F9RNZGU|5|Worked great for our dancer and team
B00FFVEGCC|3|Bigger than expected but it cute for novelty wear.
B00FA9B0PK|5|Awesomely warm, comfortable fit and I love these socks.<br /><br />However, I don't love the price I paid. I don't know how the heck I missed it but I was a bit shocked when I looked up the order and saw the price I almost crapped my pants.<br /><br />They are wonderful socks but very expensive in my book and I don't think I will be ordering any more anytime soon. Just can't afford that even tough I love the socks.
B00CBEARDI|5|Height:<br />- 5.7 foot (170 centimeters)<br /><br />Weight:<br />- 142 pounds (64 kilograms)<br /><br />Body fat:<br />- 10 percent<br /><br />Strength training and hypertrophy
B000JJJDK0|4|I got the larger size to make sure the length was good. It's a little too wide. Very pretty color and like the silky feel.
B003NX87TC|3|Runs a little large and color NOT as pictured. The red hibiscus is definitely a bright coral orange.  Not red at all.
B00PL44Z2O|2|Material is not that  my expected
B00LM475DS|5|it is small if you stuff it with a lot of things if you dont have a case that is really big you would be ok i would buy it again<br />and it got here like 2 weeks early
B001G0K922|5|Will totally recommend to pepole. Getting lots of compliments. Great cust service!
B004SWGN16|5|They are too perfect! A little long, but beyond comfy!!!
B00099CY4C|3|Smaller than a typical Large/xL, especially compared to other belts I've bought from Amazon...but the buckle is strong and sturdy and it looks nice, dressy or casual.
B00GSMT12W|5|thanks alot
B00BC2ESM6|5|Very good
B00MNGMFAW|5|Great and sexy fit.
B007E9QH9I|3|I believe a &#34;hoody&#34; has a hood.  This does not.  It is nice because it is reverse-able, but I had expected a hood.
B000GIOFV6|3|Wig was too scratchy and was not as expected. Did not work for what I thought it was going to be like.
B00J8PY694|3|Bottoms seem small when you try to put them on but they fit once you stretch them out a bit. Top was too small, but I'm a 38DD so maybe that's why... hm. Lol.
B007IFMWI8|5|I absolutely love this shirt. It was exactly like I thought it would look like. The interesting part Is it comes with an additional piece to make the shirt waste longer very cool! I'd defiantly order this in different colors if it was offered.
B00ATIPT4K|5|It fit great, just what I wanted.  The material is easy care and so soft.  Love it!  And, I was not able to find anything like this in the are.
B00Q0PACPC|1|Too small for wife according to similar sized shirts and the print is very cheap.  Seems like it will peel off easily
B009HUGEW2|5|Nice thick shawl.  It is chocolate brown, the color of a plain Hershey's chocolate bar.  Flexible, soft, size is correct.  Was a gift and she liked it.  Seems to be worth more than the price.
B00WPKMV00|4|It's super cute. The only negative is that the torso/mid section could be a little longer. It fit a little snug in the private region. Also the bust could have a little better support but I think that would be for any halter top. The bust was a little too loose and I would have liked it to be more snug and close to the body to keep my bust up. My breasts kind of just fell out of the cups. But other than that it is a great suit.
B00QXXORL6|4|It's very pretty.
B00BUB2CDQ|4|my son is 33&#34; tall, 29 lbs, and it fits him beautifully and looks adorable. Perfect for a summer wedding.  I looked at a similar suit at Jack& Janie for 4x the price and this is just as nice.  100% cotton, very lightweight.  The shirt fits well.  Pants are very long.  I don't love the tie, it's the one place where the suit looks cheap. It doesn't sit well. I wish it was an elastic band around the collar, and a less stiff tie.  Hmmm….now what to do about shoes….
B00AXDA3T2|5|This dress is absolutely amazing, sophisticated and elegant! I ordered green and the color is a little darker than the pic shown but it is a lovely color. I am a plus size woman and this dress accentuates me perfectly!
B00J28O2FK|5|Great product that arrived right on time!
B00HN8GVE6|1|The dress itself fits right, but the fabric is so stretchy and the slit does not close enough to be able to wear it out in public.  Pretty disappointed with it.
B0007W0VAK|5|i wear the bodysuit everyday and i love it. It is comfortable but yet firm and keeps everything where it needs to be! I have tried other brands of shapewear and this company seems to be the best in the biz.
B0043XMQQG|5|I bought these for my son for my wedding and it fit great and he looked like a little prince!
B00HIFPERO|4|It's more of a &#34;hip hugger&#34; desight,but is comfy..'Gonna use for workin' on the vehicle,etc...Well worth the price.
B00NCZ4Q0K|5|Love it!
B000A38EQY|5|I got these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them.  He frequently takes our dogs for walks and these keep him nice and warm.  Since it has been so cold here in the northeast US he has been wearing them alot.  We appreciate the extra length since he is 6'6\\".
B0038JC3XW|5|Just as advertised...I got a large size and usually wear a medium. But I wanted a loose fit for summer. Perfect/'nice material. Did not shrink. And at a good price
B005F28XYI|5|This is my second one in three years.  That's about how long they last.  Great deal for the money and keeps your credit cards from being scanned.
B012F5K9GM|4|love these, but they are so small. I'm 5'8&#34; and 107#'s I wear a 0-2 jeans. I ordered the mediums because it advises to order a size up. I sent them back yesterday and I'm reordering the large. Great quality, nice fabric and I love the hidden pockets.
B00NP2I912|5|Traditional with a modern feel and sturdy construction
B00BW8URU2|4|Good leather and workmanship and the key holders are made well -- some good some bad on my use of it.  bought it because keys are always punching holes in my pockets so very good for stopping this.  But, I have quit using it because the location of my ignition in my vehicle is right above my knee therefore this item hangs down bumping my leg continuously as I drive down the road.  If my key slot was on the dash, I would still by using this key holder.
B008CNBZY2|5|These jeans were a great fit and it was wonderful to get them for half price!  We were very pleased.
B00VK418CE|5|I wore it the night I received it. It is great as a top with jeans.
B000O7L7XS|2|Leather???, not so sure...
B008FC7V84|5|This shirt not only made me pick up chicks and make me look good I love joker so now I get to wear my hero everyday keep making this shirts please well done
B00ITLGRYK|5|I cannot express how happy I am with this purchase.  I am a bridesmaid and needed an all sequin gown that could not have anything but sequins on it....everything being sold in department stores is $500+ and I bought this on a whim and am SOOOO happy.  They are so professional.  They call you and ask your height, your shoe height, your measurements, basically everything.  It came and I am very pleased.  Thank you so much!!!
B000DZF1YW|5|this was a very good product. face paint and makeup usually makes my face itch like crazy but this stuff did not. i was able to wear it for hours and i could not feel it. it was easy to apply and the color was very nice with my skin tone.
B00J63DYYQ|3|It is a supportive bra, but the foam inserts are unusual.  Due to the push up effect, the foam inserts are rather voluminous.  I prefer the bra without the va va voom effect.  After several washings, the bra has held up well.
B000NWT51K|5|I like this Jean so much.
B0060JJO6G|5|Looks and feels great.
B005GVQCJ6|3|I got this bra for two reasons:  It's cotton and I wanted a leisure bra into which I could change when I get home from work.  This bra is okay for that purpose, but it's not quite as leisurely as I'd like it to be. The straps, which usually slide down on me, stay put, but they hurt unless they're placed just right.  The bra is also a bit hard to attach in the back, something I never experienced before with a bra.  It's okay for in-the-house leisure, but I'd never wear it outside.  It's got a seam which shows, and the support isn't fantastic.  All in all, it was worth what I paid for it.
B000IBNCN8|4|like any other sock, your feet sweat,sock gets wet, feet get cold ! i work out side 10 hours a day, and if your not moving, like me, your feet will get cold. i change to the second pair after 6 houres, this helps a lot, buy more than 2 pair.
B00GIYDMSY|1|wanted for my sister for wedding but this is made crappy and horrible def. will go to walmart or target
B00A4GPUCI|5|Like the quality of the fabric, perfect fit, good quality product
B00F0X9OY0|4|Super cute! Well made. But runs small
B00AMA1Q9C|5|I love these things!  Anything to keep warm.  They really help keep warm, with or without shoes.<br />Definitely need to get more.
B0036DDTSI|5|I really love my Carhartt cargo pants!  They fit well and are comfortable.  Plus, now I am addicted to having the extra pockets!  Now, when I wear pants with just the normal front pockets, I don't know where to put my stuff!
B00KMZUKR6|3|The pants stretch out by the end of the day and roll down my stomach. I can't wear them with tight shirts. They're okay for winter sweaters and blousy tops.
B0053AJQ8Y|5|loves it...but...the only thing we were surprised about was the SIZE of the backpack. it says mens but its very tiny, smaller than a regular sized backpack. maybe thats what \\"bomber\\" means? i cannot imagine an adult man wearing this, are skaters suppose to wear this when they are skating? i bought it for my 9 year old son to wear to school, it can barely fit his folder and book. i tried it on and its a bit snug for me and i am a 5'5 woman. came on time and the backpack looks awesome. just wish there had been a notation that explained that it was a tinier backpack. we are keeping it though-my son can probably wear it through this year but thats about it, then it would just look funny. i think it would be great for younger kids, like, kindergarten through 2nd grade because it doesn't hold much...
B008237UJQ|2|I was so excited when I ordered this skirt. I'd read all the amazing reviews about how flattering it was, and how high quality it was for the price. I took note that most reviewers suggested ordering a size up, and I did so. Unfortunately, when my skirt arrived, I tried it on and it was far too tight, even after ordering a size up. The thing looked terrifying on, accentuating every single bit of chub on my lower body. And the material was stiff, scratchy, and uncomfortably cheap feeling.<br /><br />I would have ordered a second one, two sizes up, if not for how uncomfortable the material was. I simply returned mine.
B00DG9Z5AC|5|Beautiful, lightweight woven fabric. Perfect for scorching summer days, and I DO mean scorching. The horizontal line across the bust area is very flattering because I am bottom-heavy, but when it was tried on by my friend, whose weight is primarily in her bust and shoulders, it didn't flatter her. A V-shaped embroidery would probably be better for these body types. The embroidery is very, very good -- not the super-fine stitches of vintage hand-woven pieces, but really clear detail and raised work that has lovely texture. I'm a lover of embroidered pieces and this is equally good for work or casual at, really, a fraction of the price of brands like JWLA.<br />Note: I'm a textbook 2X - bust 49&#34; - and the 3X is roomy, gives me a couple inches around the bustline and is comfortable enough to cover my very large hips without cling. Length is tunic-length on me, covers hips completely and reaches upper thighs without being too long. I'm 5/1&#34; so a bit on the short side, for reference. In pants I take 24WP, for reference.<br />The fabric is 100% cotton, but it's a miracle no-iron. Oh, and the black is nice and vibrant, dark black, and sets off the embroidery beautifully.
B00CW1U4B0|5|This jacket is the bomb!!!!! Put it on and it fit perfectly. Great material, design and construction, as soon as I worn it out the first time compliments started coming in!!! It is light weight which I like and I was soooooooo happy with the jacket I just ordered the red one!!!
B00BS7CCSW|5|I have received many compliments on these pants! They're different, and I like that. It's cool because you can also wear them higher as a jumper.
B00P3NAIQA|5|I loved this outfit. We got it as a gift and I was so sad when my son outgrew it. I didn't have an issue with the size and the quality was great. I highly recommend this adorable little outfit!
B00KT382LM|4|A good quality shirt, although it does fit a little large. Try ordering a size smaller than usual,
B00C3X7R58|4|Its good..
B00KI9GLYM|4|I didn't wash/dry before using, but the body was a little wide and the beanie cap was a bit large on my 8lb son.
B00FLTPZGE|3|The fabric is kind of thin but it's a good beanie.
B001VNBAWW|5|The suspenders are just the right width and have a good clip that doesn't slip while still keeping the pants need and looking well.
B00DDBW4IY|5|My son LOVES this shirt!!!!!! And it's very good quality!
B00J568PPC|3|Bra didn't fit well but the bottom was ok.
B00JMQ3ZOG|4|I purchased 2 black lace tops to wear UNDER business sleeveless tops and dresses to hide my arms and to extend the seasons that I can wear this tailored clothing in black.  ------I ordered a Large, am 36C and wear medium sleeveless tops. At first try I thought that I would not be able to get this on at all for being too small, but I did manage to squeeze into it.  It is more than skin tight, more like compression, especially over the bust.  I decided to keep it because the lace is absolutely beautiful!!  The sleeves are exactly what I wanted - long enough, and not too wide for my rather thin arms.  I plan to be very, very careful putting it on, taking it off, and also adjusting the underarm seams so that they don't rip while I'm wearing it - and to wear a molded bra so that my breasts are not flattenned.  The material does have a lot of stretch to it, and the neckline is pretty. It really is not sized according to the chart. If it came in XL I would buy more; it really is lovely. I took one star off for the sizing.
B000WK2VAK|5|Absolutely the best costume ever!!! This costume is stunning and unique! The color is amazing. Nearly theatrical quality not the cheap Halloween store quality
B00NL9WKDM|1|It's a children size small very disappointed
B0038QT4R8|4|This is a great basic - I have it in black and gray.  I like that it is easy to put on and take off.  A lot of sports bras aren't stretchy enough.  And, it's comfortable and sturdy enough for high impact sports, like running or crossfit.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's very plain.  Not a big deal since it's mostly covered up.
B00801T7M8|5|Have a pair of these in a different color. Loved them so much waited for a good sale. Which finally came about. So I jumped at buying another pair.. They fit true to size I'm a 123 pounds  and 5' 5&#34;. And they fit like made just for me.  And ya know if they had not, could have returned them for free. Can not go wrong with that deal.
B006SRTAOG|5|This is the best natural fiber type top I have found. Wears well and washes nicely. Plus the Amazon price is better!
B00AKSCNWA|5|Sometimes your balls bounce around when you hike. Other times they're crushed beneath overeager compression shorts. These are the just right of ball cuppage.
B00M4919GE|5|Good product. However it runs waaay too big, I bought the smallest and I have to send it to the tailor because the measurements are too large.
B00WHJB8B2|5|Amazing dress. Looks very well made.
B00WHGL798|5|Very classy & appropriate for the office or church
B00JH1HL5K|3|I thought I ordered it in brown, but it came in white (I may have made that mistake, but normally would not order white). The weight feels pretty heavy for an inexpensive product, but it does run a bit small around.  I could see calling it a large, but not extra large.  I will keep it, just not sure I can give a good rating due to the small size.
B00APPF5U0|5|This is a follow up review. This is my third season with this parka and it is still going strong. This season has been especially cold and snowy. The money spent on this parka was well spent. So grateful for this parka!
B009TAWB68|5|It is wonderful for those bad hair days, plus it keeps your head warm.
B000OGD3DG|5|Love this
B002RWKJZU|5|The items arrived quickly and well packaged. I wear 32# waist pants and ordered the medium. Seemed a little big out of the package, but after washing they shrunk a little and fit perfectly.
B00284B5T6|4|I would give this product five stars if it didn't dig into your shoulders as much as it does.  Wore it for a long work day under some skinny jeans and a tight shirt.  The slimmer didn't budge or become unhinged, but my shoulders ached by the end of the day.  My shoulders aren't raw by any means, but are definitely sore and uncomfortable enough that I can't wait to get this thing off of me!
B00AOCFPPE|5|It works as advertised no surprises or anything or that nature. I am 6'2&#34; and male waist 33 and it is actually tight even with a belt. I could easily see someone with a waist 36 fitting perfectly with a belt
B0041HV4US|4|My biggest problem with this is how far back the &#34;hairline&#34; sits. I have really struggled to cover my own hairline, even with a wig cap and my bangs pinned back. I don't have a widows peak so I can't imagine how bad this could look on someone who does. The color is okay, not quite as pictured, but definitely not unattractive. I haven't had great success with making it look just like the picture but you can't use hot irons so a little creativity is required. As far as quality goes, it's better than anything you'll find at Party City or Spirit for under $20 bucks. I'd recommend it to someone competent in wig styling because this thing could last quite a few uses if you know how to properly care for it.
B006EXMC8U|5|I read reviews before buying this, so I expected it to run small. The 0-3 month that I ordered is comparable to most Newborn sizes found in gowns of other brands.  It is a perfect size for a brand new baby.  The quality is great and when comparing to other gowns...it is much softer.  It has no irritating tags and the sleeves fold in to cover baby's hands to keep them from scratching their face.
B00A26ATBM|5|Love these socks!! Perfect for all seasons. Not to heavy for hot weather and easily layered with a liner sock if nessecary. I think they would even work as a liner sock with my heavier boot socks in the winter for my pack boots Also love the 11\\" height. They stay up!!!
B004LWZ2S8|5|I purchased this hat for my 4 1/2 month old son because his various 0-6 month hats were not fitting any more. The width of this hat works quite well for us, but sags down over his eyes after a few minutes of wear. So I cuff the bottom once, and it fits great. The color is true to the photo and the top knot design is adorable. I haven't washed it yet, but hopefully it will not fade once I do. The material is warm enough for mild winter weather, and seems like it will not be too much in the summer.
B00H6E742U|3|I bought a Liverpool hat but I got a Man U hat instead.<br />Otherwise, it's pretty good
B002UQXJ1O|5|good, very good
B0046H5X9Q|1|Just be aware this is not the normal cherokee top, it is \\"touch\\" which is a silky material. Not at all what I expected.
B00BYLKWZM|5|I was skeptical at first but very relieved when the suit arrived.  It is made of fine wool and well made.  Just had to hem the pants and I was in a tux for practically nothing.
B000WN5JRE|5|Bien
B00G56WY84|5|Interesting design, easy to wear.
B00AIHMEXQ|5|Great buy!
B004HO6MNO|4|The shirt arrived exactly as pictured, though slightly wrinkled and it had an odd smell (which will likely go away once washed). I wore it to work same day it arrived. It is very comfortable and two breast pockets make it somewhat handy as well.  I am 5'4 130 lb and ordered the small and it fit just right. The fabric has a nice looking shine to it as well. I haven't washed it yet, but will update if anything changes when I do.
B00MOID774|3|Okay cute
B00C7INLE0|1|Sleeve ripped within a few times of wearing it. Product is very cheap and I do not recommend<br /><br />If you do decide to get it note that this runs small as to be expected with Korean sizes, but it is still a little shorter than I expected. And aside from the button down collar it looks great
B00DHMBIOK|4|Delivered on time and fits just right! Plus it looks awesome!
B00JXH7L9Y|5|It's the perfect shape for my dress, and the modesty panel under all the fluff means I don't have to worry about showing too much when I twirl!
B00NU75C76|4|Comfortable, but def should not put in dryer, will shrink.
B00D01J0BQ|1|i ordered up a size to a medium, i usually wear a small in women's (size 6) and this i could barely get it over my bum. if i saw these at a store i would think they were child's size.
B00I1AA326|3|Go up a size.  I'm busty on top though
B00MA6V4Y8|3|it's cool but i wouldnt  advise you to buy it for winter, its very thin but the color is prominent
B0008EOH2U|4|I was shocked at the fit.  They fit me very well so, I ordered  two more pairs
B0056G1DTU|4|I like the shirt.  The weigh is nice for chilly days and it is well made.  I would have given it 5 stars if the arm length would have been 2 inches longer.
B005DIFV80|5|Wrangler FR jeans seem to fit better than any other brand. Still hot in the summer time but thats FR cloths. Price is same or less than most others also.
B00AWB3JSM|5|Excellent product.  Fits well, comfortable and supports the back as advertised.  Better than expected.
B0012IQ73I|1|but I never received it.  They were out of stock.  The company selling it did offer me a discount on any other purchase, but I decided not to try buying there again.
B00CZ7TRZA|5|Love it , comfortable, feels right
B00JW5MSC2|3|It's too small and doesn't look quite the same as in the picture
B004VV5ZDQ|5|I liked them so much I wore them all the time climbing, biking, and being active in general to the point I lost weight and they don't fit anymore. I'll be buying a small size for sure.
B000G1JMS4|5|Perfect..just love them..
B000N5GROA|5|Beautiful vest. So happy to have my fiance' wearing this in our wedding! This is about the 7th vest I have ordered. Great value
B007IDM2B2|5|I really like this hoodie. Thin enough for layering, but not so thin that you feel like you're wearing mesh. I typically wear a women's size XL, but the men's size M fits me perfectly. I'll definitely be buying more of these in the future!
B009YRM6MK|3|I love everything about this bra including the price, but this 3488 is smaller than others I have bought at dept. store. I need to use an extender with this one.
B00BV2VCAI|1|Way to small you sill need to get 2 sizes bigger in this shirt very disappointed was looking forward to wearing it
B00U3D4S2K|5|very beautiful flowers looks great.
B001R1L18Q|4|Although this hoodie appears to be a cute idea, the fabric was very rough and the bleach spots didn't have a genuine \\"oops I spilled bleach on the hoodie\\" look.  In truth it could have been a great product but just fell short
B003EM8BE8|4|UPDATE:  I've been mostly purse-free for over a year now and there's no looking back.  No more awkwardly clutching over-sized bags stuffed with needless junk and digging in an endless chasm of crumpled receipts for my cell phone.  With the exception of when I wear skirts or dresses, I carry this wallet every day. Other than some signs of wear that would probably be resolved by a good washing, this wallet has held strong through international travel and every day use.  Most of my issues with it are caused by annoyances of women's fashion (mostly lack of pockets in dress slacks and minuscule or no pockets in denim jeans), not the product itself.  It fits everything I need from coupons to cards to cash.  It's a minimalist's dream.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Finally! A front pocket wallet that isn't ultra masculine!  I'm planning to take a trip to Ireland soon and in lieu of taking a bulky purse that will just become a black hole for tourist pamphlets and receipts, I'm opting for a wallet. Having been an ardent purse carrier for all my adult life, this is a big change. Honestly, it fits everything I need: a little cash, a couple credit/debit cards and my medical insurance cards. No frills. Best of all it will curb my need to hoarde business cards and countless tubes of chapstick.  The quality is good, but as others mentioned, the fabric is slick. I'm doubling up my cards and if that doesn't help I'll try washing it to shrink the card slots.
B006ZIHIJM|4|I actually purchased this for use by models in my photo shoots. I have used it a few times on different models. It looked good on all.
B00HLY5ZDK|3|The sizing is completely wrong!! I am extremely disappointed that even an XXXL was more like a medium! I gave this dress to a coworker but I will never again buy this brand. This product should be marked as a Petite product.
B00F0WW844|1|When puchase this make sure u double ur size or tribble
B00FJ2OLFY|4|I love the fit, color (I got \\"sea foam\\") and material of this top. I'm a fan of roomy, loose shirts and this fits the description perfectly. For anyone who is insecure about the tummy region, the billowing of the bottom part of the shirt will hide and flatter anything and everything. By the way, from the pictures you can't really tell, but the top is actually hi-low, which makes the shirt even better in my opinion. The lace panels are my particular favorite part, but overall everything looks awesome.    Edit: The material is still nice and soft but I found out that it pills quite quickly.. BUT I still love the top in general.
B00F0VZ9LO|3|like the fit, colors, and the material - my biggest problem is that when I received them they were SOOOOOOOOOOO wrinkled I was sorry I had purchased them - they looked as if they had been laying balled up in a corner for a while and then the seller did not care how they looked when they shipped out and I think that this is ABSOLUTELY awful for the purchase of a new product and the hopes of a return customer (but then that's just me)
B007AAL5XY|3|I agree with the other reviewers. The costume is beautiful, but definitely snug up top!! WOW.. I wore it for my Halloween costume party this weekend. Cleavage looked AMAZING, received tons of compliments on it. But the arms were too snug. I had the costume on for about 8 hours and by the time I took it off, the fabric had left marks in my arms around my elbows. OUCH. My arms ached for 24 hours. Way too tight. I've lost quite a bit of weight and don't wear 18-20 in regular clothes, most clothes I'm down to a 16, some a 14, so I assumed the 18-20 in the costume would be a little loose, if anything. When ordering, order a larger size, because this runs small. But, it was made well. Looks beautiful!! I may wear it another year, when I'm a little smaller - just change it up a bit!!
B00JFKQTWE|4|I'd give it a 5 star but the bow tie is a clip on and falls off all the time. Using it for my sons baptism so I'm going to see a string on it.
B00BRDDINA|4|Fit great!
B00P4PTL3S|5|Extremely satisfied with all aspects of the order.  The quality of the belts, the color and the fast service were outstanding.  Thank you all very much!
B001H1PYD4|1|This bra is comfortable and practical, but it started to unravel after just two washes. I would not buy it again. Bummer!
B000UX38QA|4|Awesome hat, it is great for keeping you warm. I'm glad that I finally found one.
B00ECCXWNY|5|Too Cute!!  I had lots of compliments on this shirt!
B003O68FF4|1|very poor quality.  the material was cheap and not realistic like the photo.  Fits smaller than sized for a 2x mens.  The belt buckles are thin plastic material that bends easily not even resembling a buckle.  The vest is a clingy fabric that gets bunched up.  the hat is felt, along with the boots, making it look very bad and deformed.  Overall a poor quality.
B00DE8G9P0|5|This wallet has room for paper money, cards, small tickets and coins.  It even has a key ring.  I think it will be invaluable when traveling.
B00FP1ARWU|4|A little large, but ended up a good fit .
B00N39VH16|5|I am 5'11&#34; and 125lbs and this dress fit me perfectly! I'm not very curvy and this was still quite feminine on me. Frabric breathes well and is a beautiful color.
B00IIJFBAO|3|Runs small .. but looks great..
B003C2AXJQ|5|Sport-Tek - Wind Pant. PST74 - X-Large - Navy<br />Sport-Tek - Wind Pant. PST74 - X-Large - Navy<br />Perfect replacements for old ones
B00AAQ1FDU|4|Love love love it. It helps with posture & figure. I'm about 120 lbs & bra size 34 A/B, and a small fits fine.
B00C6TZON6|5|This is the ugliest yet funniest top, lol. Perfect for the company, ugly sweater contest! Thank you!
B00CKLI6X0|2|It runs way too small.
B000GDK33U|5|Very comfortable underwear for children, save fabric and fits exactly as expected. The only recommendation is to get kids interior packages in various colors, is not easily achieved.
B001O5ZTPG|5|This wallet is perfect! It seems kinda cheap when you first get it especially since you pay less than ten dollars, but let me tell you, this is the best wallet I have ever owned. Mine lasted me for three years before having to be replaced which I'll take considering it's been with me every single day for the past three years. Perfect amount of space for various card, the clear front for IDs and a strong magnet for my money all without being to bulky. Couldn't think of a better wallet.
B0076451NY|5|My husband loves these board shorts.  Great length and fit!  Now he can show his team spirit around the beach!
B00TDMSM4W|1|BUYER BEWARE!! This top is NOTHING like the image you see above. It is flimsy with no folds; additionally, the back of the shirt is plain and lifeless. I got an XL (I usually wear an American Large, because I am busty) , but it is designed to fit an XS person...Really? I wish vendors/sellers were forced to be honest about sizing and the images they post, because this is nothing like was advertised. It is certainly FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! DO NOT BUY.
B00L8F6PPA|5|I read the reviews that said they were small. Im 5'10&#34; and 215 pounds. I normally wear a US Large but decided to go with a US XLarge. It did fit a little big but it is going to get altered anyway so it didnt matter too much in the end.<br /><br />Im using this product as a Houndoom cosplay and for the price and quality of the item I'm very pleased!
B00KPQQQ52|4|I found the Haggar brand to run a little small.  I returned the item and it was processed quickly.  A great way to shop online.
B000UU46BE|5|Classic coat with updated hood....comfortable and very warm...price was reasonable and love the style...great day coat for casual look as well as works with most night out events...have received many compliments
B000FFSKNO|5|When my feet are cold, as soon as I put these on my feet I can feel them begin to warm up immediately, love these socks!
B00LUVS00U|5|Bought as gift for father-n-law. Loved it. Want one for myself.
B00GY27VKK|5|Looks great and fits perfect!
B001CF90MG|5|anything relating to PF is the best. the shirt looks great on or off of me.thanks so very much. SAC
B003C1PZQI|5|These pajamas are so comfortable. The only thing is the top is a bit see through so I wear a jacket with them when I'm not sleeping.
B00BPNFPS8|5|I always receive compliments whenever I wear this! People can't believe I got it for so cheap on Amazon!<br /><br />PS. the bottoms are a little &#34;low cut&#34; so if you are concerned about this, get a larger sized bottom
B00B71H4G4|2|I was disappointed in this belt because the first time I wore it, it broke.  I love the looks of the belt, but if it's broke, you can't wear it.  I went to Amazon now to see if I could return it, and they said that I cannot because the return window has closed.
B004DKWE48|1|Ouch! I ordered this because of all of the great reviews but this thing hurts! The boning digs deep into my sides and causes deep red painful marks, the top rolls down, the bottom rubs against my inner thighs and the seams itch and irritate my skin. I used their sizing chart and the amount of compression isn't even that tight on me so it isn't too small. The website says you can't return if you've opened the packaging or tried it on but hello why else would you return it if you never opened it? I e-mailed them because they say to do so if you are unsatisfied in any way and I have yet to receive a response. Blah. Save your money!
B000P0X15G|5|Great adjustable hat to put on tiny heads!
B00E0G2WZQ|3|Funky fit. I think we ordered a size too big, but still didnt fit right.
B00IJHJK3O|2|still hanging in my closet
B00CDKYHAO|5|very nice material and great pants !
B008EM7GGM|5|Good quality shirt, the decal isn't/hasn't peeled off of it and the fabric is fairly soft. We used it to announce our pregnancy to my in-laws and it was well-recieved if not a little bit too subtle.
B00130VVIG|5|I have been using one of these Bosca Card Holders for the last 7 years and they hold up really well. The only thing that has happened to them after years of heavy use is the lining inside (in the middle part) which is not leather has cracked.  However, this issue does not diminish the functionality of this item since there is another lining that sits on the leather part beneath the cracked lining. And since it is a small part inside the card holder it doesn't really show. I have been carrying this card holder in my pants pockets every day since 2006 and it's been soaked wet a few times in the rain and the ocean. The leather is holding up really nice and it still looks good. Since I put my money in my pants front pocket and put my credit and other cards in this cardholder, I don't need to use the other (bulky) wallets which is what I love about this Bosca. Also, because of the way it's designed cards don't slip out accidentally since it's folded. So when I saw this Bosca on Amazon, I immediately bought one to have as a backup when the time comes to replace my old one.  Bottom line great quality, great design and size which easily fit in any small pocket.
B00U4A1RR6|5|This is a very cute and sexy outfit it fits as expected, it is made out of a very breathable material, very soft, comfortable and durable
B00GOU0B0E|5|beautiful shirt. i love it.
B00E5N0CUQ|3|The image that is shown as Ballerina Bunnies is a different one!  Nothing wrong with this one, just not the one I ordered!!!
B004CO6XB0|4|I have a shoulder problem and the front closure was just what I needed.
B0030BXFQC|5|My hub has a hard time finding jeans that fit in the thighs and in the length..these are perfect..he can kneel and work without worry.
B00EKFLTFG|4|Good
B0058DXR2C|5|The Coobie bras were the only ones I could wear while pregnant. They accommodate fluctuating sizes comfortably, and are more flattering than a sports bra. Highly recommend.
B003E98N9O|4|My head is small around for an adult so this hat was too big.  I bought a few Velcro sticky pieces of white tape and<br />placed 4 of them inside the hat.  Worked fine.<br />I don't think the hat actually looks cheap, it kinda looks OK.  If someone were to handle it they might feel the cheap<br />felt material so don't let anyone hold it.<br />It would be wearable, again, if I needed it for another affair so for the few dollars I paid for it it was a good deal.<br />If something happened to it or it got stained or stepped on or I left it at a hotel or restaurant I wouldn't worry about<br />it.  Not so if I bought a hat for 80 dollars ...<br />All in all I am very pleased that I bought it.
B001CVVF8W|5|Fits well; great quality for price.<br />I do wish they came in &#34;long&#34; sizes.
B00857Z1N6|5|I'm not sure why others are having issues with comfort.  This bra is just as good (might even be better than) as my VS bras that I paid 3x the price for - so comfortable!  After my breasts were deflated from breastfeeding, these bras seriously know how to give my girls life again!
B00817DZWO|5|I like T-Shirts with a pocket. This works.
B00DBOWSGG|3|i wear a size 11, in womens pants, and have a 28 inch waist, 33 inch hips, 40in behind, LOVE the pants they came in 10 says! (not counting sunday) the only thing is that theyre sheer but im black so it works well lol. i kind of had to shimmy into them for them to fit because if my big butt ._. so basically ladies, wear black underwear if youre black and if you have lighter skin wear a long shirt or youll be embarassed! i got the Cross leggings. pattern was sort of like lowercase t's not as shown on the picture but i still like them. better for people of maybe size 4-9. these arew now my favorite pair of leggings! BUT BEWARE, THE CROSSES ARE UPSIDE DOWN IN SOME SPOTS
B006B2RWNY|5|SO CUTE! I got many compliments from other women while wearing it out.
B00KRWU7U4|2|color is darker and harsher than the picture, runs quite small - I ordered up a size because of other reviews, but still too small, and the arms are very tight
B00AVMLXDU|1|Bought it for my son who's in college. Substandard and badly made. Absolute waste of money. Could have been a one-off, but I'm certainly not going to buy Volcom stuff again.
B00XJP0UOY|3|It was too large in the chest area for me.
B00BXZGHZI|5|Tailoring is excellent, nice finish
B00E8U4AD6|3|I bought a pink dress as a gift for my niece but I got a purple, the same model, but unfortunately failed the color and that was a problem for me because I had one exactly the same color to her sister. Please pay attention to the packing.
B0015PP2CK|1|VERY CUTE BUT RIDICULOUSLY TOO SMALL! I WEAR EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE SIZE I BOUGHT AND COULDN'T EVEN GET THEM OVER MY THIGHS.... NOW THEY DON'T HAVE A SIZE BIGGER- HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!
B00CP6TH4M|4|Awesome socks but geared more for ppl with smaller feet. I am a guy with size 12/13 US. They have to stretch out a bit but once they do they are very comfortable and snug ; -)! Great for working out and around the house. I'm a big Marvel Fan so I love them anyway!!
B00GP2OM42|4|I like I like I like.  Soft as pj's and light material.  I can't wait to wear it next winter.
B00CHQ52L2|5|My husband loves that plush warmness!
B00CERDB6M|1|The worst
B003RADN5Y|5|My boyfriend loved these! They are very cheap but shockingly well made! A must buy!
B00DVPM888|5|Excelente
B00D3Y3VO2|5|One of my favorite shirts in my closet! I get a compliment every time I wear it
B002IREKCM|1|Came with a giant rip in the seam!
B00BJOGQ1S|5|Warm & cosy
B005DI4I6Q|5|Extremely cute! MADE SMALL! get a size up. I normally wear a 12. Ordered size XL and it fits great
B00DB1TMCC|5|Very Cozy robe. Definitely recommend it. It's worth the price. All three kids wanted to climb into it with me!
B00JR4NFFW|4|Same problem with the strap too,  i recommend using those bra strap clips to help.  This bra fits very well, and very comfortable.  But the packing was soooo bad, you should put them in a box!
B003HC8RVM|3|I originally posted a better review. These seem like good quality. The problem is, THEY FALL OFF MY FEET. So far, in three different shoes/boots, the socks slid down under my foot while I was walking. Just one sock, too. Very annoying. Socks should stay UP.
B00AYVBUKY|1|The St Patty's day hat was way too large!!<br />I'm quite disappointed because we wanted to wear them in a St Pat's parade!!<br />When we are riding our bikes in the parade,  we can't be grabbing at our hats!!<br />We'd tumble off and domino the whole parade!
B00L53FZAQ|3|Feels okay once I had it on. But I had to let it out all the way and it was a bit difficult to snap it on. But tying it was easy. Very sexy, but a bit small fitting.
B00BFWBQOG|1|bad design and cant put it together
B002AYWWQY|1|DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS WASTE OF MONEY. My advice is to just cut some of your Hair Pubes and tape then into your rogue goatee.
B00NEQJCWO|1|I just did not like the quality of this dress.  It looked so much nicer online.  It was also too casual for the wedding I wanted it for.
B004JUJ7W4|3|I didn't know it was a  tee shirt.  I thought it was more of a sweat shirt.<br />I bought an XL and it was tight on me.  I'm 5'4&#34;  145.  but I carry my weight on top. so maybe<br />I'm to chubby for this.
B00794OM6S|4|The only scrubs I wear.
B0002TOZ00|5|Perfect
B00DNN4P0C|1|Uueven and I couldn't send it back. The bust was to big and the b9ttwm to small. They told me they would give me 20 percent and that was it. So I have a useless top. But the top was cute
B007B5F0ZW|5|It fits well and the material doesn't feel like that cheap nylon...<br />I was surprised by the quality...<br />Great price too!
B009Z09UT8|5|Love these! Great holiday pick !
B00JMEZJLU|5|We were given this set as a gift and I liked it so much I purchased a set as a gift for a friend. They are very soft and well made.
B00PN4EZOU|5|Love love love this outfit!!! It is comfortable. Not to mention so comfy! My baby boy loves to wear the onsie by itself, then when going out and about, the pants that match are super comfy and the shoes/socks that come with it are my favorite part of the whole outfit! The whole color scheme is adorable. My dad is in construction so this is the perfect outfit to wear with his papa!!! Thanks for an amazing outfit!!
B00GFAM7N2|5|Love the hat the style and the color is great. My only complaint is that it kept sliding forward cause it was too big. But I took tucks in it and I still wear it because it is so warm.  We are in the middle of a big blizzard and that is the hat I am wearing
B0027BFEA6|5|Just as described - husband loves this coat
B00QE5IQ74|4|MY GUYS LOOKED REALLY GREAT AT OUR PARTY! EVERYONE COMMENTED ON THEIR SHIRTS. THEY WERE GREAT CONVERSATION STARTERS!
B00IVED5EA|5|Love it!  Great shirt even though it runs a little small
B00C3AD4VW|4|Requested by my teen son. T-shirt has held up to many washings and is made well. No complaints with the quality.
B00KGSD07G|4|Great Christmas gift
B007JPMWP0|5|EXCELLENT SWEATSHIRT.....
B003IBLDHC|4|I bought this for my grandson and he swims in it....but he is only 2 months old and it is an adorable product.  My daughter fell in love with it.
B00J0VCU76|4|They feel a little rough to me and the seam is a little badly sewn. Had to take scissors and cut the little thread knots in the inside corners.
B00HQ509A8|5|Amazing
B008B6QAMC|5|I purchased this dress for my wife almost 2-years to the date and every time she wears it she still gets rave reviews!<br />The dress is true to size, comfortable without looking dowdy and very stylish.<br /><br />Would certainly recommend.
B00567IAWC|5|What a great shirt! Very comfortable and true to size & flashier than how it looks in the picture, which I like. I highly recommend!
B00HW0ZWM2|4|good linen quality.
B00M89UE16|4|The gloves are wonderful for keeping your hands warm during the winter and have a great grip especially if you're biking! Also, they are very pretty - I love the sparkle and material in the front. I wish the medium/large size could be a little large (they are a little fitting), but otherwise, perfect!
B000MXKMFS|5|Very good quality and fit perfectly.
B00D91TWN8|5|I bought this for my daughter and it's a great dress.  I bought the red 26&#34; petticoat to go underneath and it makes it so much fun.  Really good quality.  Very reasonable price.  Fast shipping.
B00C1SZ8M4|3|very very long even tho I'm on the short side. no way to shorten it because of the hi-lo.
B00MT6DWGM|5|Soft and comfy!
B00WQ6GA3M|4|I was dreading a summer time baby as I already run a bit hotter than the average gal. Since we are having company once our baby is born in July, and I am not only having a c-section which makes clothing comfort an issue but I also plan to breastfeed, I was really worried about finding something realistically modest that wouldn't make me feel like I was on fire.  Overall: This robe is sheer as to be expected from muslin, but I can't even believe how lightweight and soft it is. The colors are absolutely beautiful together, and I'm really excited to have found something to cover up around my modest in-laws without making anyone blush.  Fit: Usually with One Size clothes, they fit on the gigantic side. However, with this robe the fit is much slimmer. It isn't a very structured style so it would easily fit a wide range of women. The sleeves come just below my elbows, the back comes to my mid-thighs so no bending over in front of company, and the front comes up just a bit higher. To be fair, I am 36 weeks pregnant, 5'4&#34; and currently 175 lbs. The inside tie doesn't come anywhere near close fitting but I could cinch it around my belly and pull it closed with a very slim gap near the thighs. Included, but not attached, is a separate sash tie for the outside of the robe. They say in the description that it is unconnected so it doesn't limit the types of body shapes that will fit. I do wish it had belt loops. That said, since it IS marketed as a maternity robe, keep in mind that they probably mean to say &#34;post natal&#34; but that doesn't have a catchy ring to it.  It looks darling, feels fantastically thin, will absolutely do the job, and I'm glad I purchased it. I wouldn't recommend for particularly modest women who are sensitive to the sheer aspect, but as far as a lightweight and lovely cover up for a relatively average sized woman, this will make a great robe. I wouldn't plan on it fitting so well over a pregnant belly like pictured, but you will have some room towrap around a post-natal stomach and continue wearing well beyond early motherhood days.
B007U3HJ7M|5|This was part of my 8 year olds halloween peacock costume. What a hit. Looked great with the other accessories.
B00BW9IQHM|5|Look im a big guy so I knew what I was getting with a 2x. I but them all the time and it always has a slight baggy feel to them. This one was a little on the small side though. Excellent shirt however and will order more.
B007BLNNQY|4|Bought men's shirts because there longer .should have bought a large a little snug in chest. But lightweight which makes it cool.washes great no ironing.
B00HYTE8DU|3|it's should be extra large as quote
B009FV9NQM|1|Its very cheaply made for sure. I ordered it at least 4 sizes bigger and it was still snug! Not impressed at all.
B000BMIAOK|2|I ordered this thinking it looked cute and it would help keep my face out of the sun. The plastic band-piece (that wraps around the forehead) is quite painful. The hat sits uncomfortably on the head and it's an odd shape. I like that it has a large bill...other than that I don't like this hat. I'll force myself to wear it while gardening...if I can tolerate wearing it that long. Most likely I'll get a headache after about 15 mins.
B00J9CQYV4|5|we have been shopping for bts clothes for our Grand children this one is so cute ,and fits great she loves to get new clothes.
B00FT1BPEU|4|Pants were a bit long and need a hem but my fiance loved this suit and wanted it badly. Looks great on him
B00LEUCLSO|5|I'm saving this gown for my trip to Europe but expect it to be just what I want.
B00MW1QWNE|5|My 8 year old granddaughter loves these.
B002G9UDGE|5|My son loves this shirt. He is a young adult. I'm back to see what other colors I can find for him for Christmas.
B00BORKMTM|2|I didn't like the stays in the sides
B00JQGKO1Y|4|I'm 6'2&#34; amd180 lbs with an athletic build. I ordered the medium, which usually fit me well from most places, but this was too small. The shirt looked well made, and I'm ordering another in L.
B00B2XWQ56|1|I've ordered these leggings twice and I keep getting pink with white and red polka dots! It's so disappointing, because they were to match my daughters bday tutu. Cute but looks defective with the red dots.
B00EI53ZUK|4|Just what I wanted, and at a great price.
B001FSKDD0|5|These are the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn and I am 63 years old.  That says a lot.  Please don't stop making them.  Mine originally came from Kohl's, but they don't have them anymore.  Any ideas on how to get some?
B0064HGNR2|1|Bought the size recommended, loose in some areas, tight in others!  If I wanted my breasts under my armpits, I would tape them there!  No &#34;modesty coverage&#34; for cold days, if you know what I mean.
B0013G83W2|5|I'm 5'3.5&#34; My torso is the right length for my proportions but my legs are bit long so generally one piece items like this don't ever fit me, because I have the legs of a 5'7 model and short torso. But to my surprise, this one piece fits perfectly (even in the bust area- I'm a 26F/28E).  I definitely recommend it for short torsos.  It looks great!
B001203BJE|4|Very happy with this item and very happy with how quickly this was received.  Well priced and posted very quickly.  :)
B00AZC6WM8|5|it is quicksilver! quality! price!  fits my wallet, S3, keys and a few more items in the biggest pocket. great on the go fanny
B00MK5WL6E|5|I bought this for my mom.  They feed birds and because they do they also feed squirrels. They are always telling me the squirrels are so bold they come up to the window and this shirt just explained it so well.
B00J216Q7Y|3|I love the top but it was too small. How can I return it. Please send me details. Thank you.
B00MQ4W68C|1|Definitely to small and my Great Grandson isn't a fat boy.He is just right in the weight department.I am going to donate it.He was disappointed when staying over our house opened the pajamas and immediately you could see they were way to small.
B00MXXBWKY|5|I got a large, i'm a size 10/11 38b bust. i had to stretch the ribbons out quite a bit. i dont mind my back showing though so it was fine, fit okay once i opened it up some. its so soft and my bf loved it
B003F2D534|4|We like these a lot as they stay up, even though they are a little big. Our daughter is 6 months, and rather small. She has room to grow.
B002Y42GG6|5|This purchase was well worth the wait. I got it yesterday from the post office and I wore it all day today. My head and most importantly to me my ears were toasty. Excellent all around.
B00GSVSH14|5|Great T-Shirt.
B00KNNM6QU|3|I like the jacket but I feel like it should be a little longer for a boy. Girls normally wear waist length jackets.
B000RWNC10|5|My husband likes to wear jazzy socks.  Most of the colorful, patterned socks are crew socks that he cannot bear.  He likes to wear over-the-calf socks.  These sock garters allows him the comfortably wear the crew socks, and they keep the socks from sliding down.
B007M69PF6|4|Product arrived just as  described and I get so many compliments, the rhinestones did not start falling off after about 2 weeks though, other than that, it's super cute.
B00HUS75CQ|4|Good quality for the money...Washes well with minimal shrinkage....
B008P72OC2|5|I just receive my item and I love love love it !!!! It's a Large and fits perfectly a lil wrinkled but can be ironed o. It's a silky material love it . Did I mention I love it?!
B00DV1L5N6|5|Love it!
B00LBQCZ1O|2|I Love how this jacket looks!!!! BUT, the material wasnt hoodie material. i think hoodies are like polyester or something. Anyways, this hoodie looks kool but only for cosplay. it feels uncomfortable to wear everywhere. its almost like a scratchy nylon feel. Also sleeves are kinda short for me. And the hood was a little overwelming. i knew you had to button it on but it wass mostly just in the way and looked awkward because if the sewing and creases in it.
B0043008CI|2|When received it was stuck fast closed. required prying open and bend stuff to repair. It was for a fun gift and sufficed in that reguard but mildly disappointing to start with a repair instead of a laugh.
B008AQ9JOE|5|Great!
B000Q7EGZ2|2|These were too thick and when I cut them they still were too large.  I  Would not buy these again
B00HESUB4Q|5|Order a size bigger than u are
B004ZCXKTM|3|I also ordered this item in black and purple and i received a black with a white dc on it.  The picture is not they color they are sending!!
B0051U195O|5|Comfortable boot socks, providing good cushioning and warmth. The  X-Large fits well for me as I wear size 11 -11/2 boots.
B00JW1Q6II|5|i like it because i give me more air to breath and i like to train insane
B002FA1G5G|3|The style is ok, but its not really as it looks the bobs at side are not as long.  Took me forever this get this by the time I did the theme party I was to go to came and went.
B00LJV855G|5|The outfit is so cute. My stepdaughter wore it to her 9th birthday party and many of the  mothers wanted to know where I got her outfit. My stepdaughter loved it as well!
B007ATNSRQ|3|The loungers with the label Dreams and Co and the dresses from Only Necessities are from Woman Within and they are much cheaper through their catalog.<br />I'm looking at the new catalog right now and this EXACT dress - same color and all - is $21.99.<br /><br />Wonder why?
B008PFWAFA|5|excellent
B00DTWH9D2|4|Love this shirt.
B0085N4HT4|1|I was really excited to finally receive my shirt but was quickly disappointed when I opened the package. The shirt was not as described or what I thought then it's the wrong color....now I'm pissed!!  Ladies do not order this shirt because it's not worth the money or time to return it. It's super thin and flimsy!!  This shirt should've been sold at the Dollar Tree....I'm not happy!!
B000ZHGBU6|3|Loose on her legs
B00NQGHJR2|3|I ordered these because I wanted a pair of silk braces to bring out the orange/rust-colored stripe on a dark-brown suit with which I planned to wear them. For reasons I will soon explain, I usually opt for a solid-colored braces rather than patterns or multicolored designs. However, because this particular color was so difficult to find, I decided this time that a subtle color-on-color pattern such as herringbone would also be acceptable.<br />The texture and the appearance of the silk fabric are both stunning. Ironically, the herringbone pattern actually gives the silk an exquisite sheen and  elegance that a solid satin in this color would not have. The color of the silk matches perfectly the stripe in my suit and the dominant color of my bow tie.<br />The problem - and this is the primary reason I prefer solid colors - is that during the cheap, corner-cutting Chinese manufacturing process, care was not taken to insure alignment of the vertical herringbone pattern with the edges of the braces. The result, as you can see in the photos, is a pair of braces made of beautiful material but a pattern noticeably askew. Granted, if someone else notices the defect they're probably standing too close to you anyway, but it's such a shame that they took such a fine silk fabric and carelessly screwed it up. Maybe it's just me, but for this price I expected better.<br />Another thing I dislike about these braces is the leather button extensions, (if they even are real leather), are very hard and very thick. It hurt so much when they pressed against my back and flanks that I was unable to wear them. Once I replaced the extensions with softer ones from an old cheap spare pair I had lying around, I was able to wear them. But don't you think that you be able to wear a pair of brand-new braces without making alterations?
B00INKAG08|5|Love it, the black Cherry is simply beautiful, will be getting other colors for sure.
B00LSVLWZ2|5|NIce fit.
B0011VQJB6|5|I bought these for my husband, great product. He has owned different brands and this is his new favorite. The zipper and flap on top works well for his notebook and phone, so when he leans forward stuff is not falling out, also a nice place for his pocket watch. Although a bit small around the middle, the fabric is a good weight, and when he drops a couple of pounds he should be able to button the top side button.
B003TFE5HW|5|I bought two of these to wear while I needed to leave my back free to heal from something; they adhere quite well to my skin and fit comfortably; I like that the material is thin (as opposed to the thicker silicone version some other strapless/backless use) and is easy to apply. I am usually a 34C, and run a bit smaller in that cup but not small enough for a 34B; I bought the B here, based on reviews, and am glad I did - those fit just about right. Really smooth under clothing and super comfortable to wear.
B00H46N5H8|5|Low and hidden. Grip works wonders so they don't move around. They are even shorter than other ones I've had that sometimes can actually show in the shoes.<br /><br />After several washes, it seems they will be durable as well. They are a bit small for me, or I should say, I'd prefer if they ran a little larger and didn't add much tension to my foot. Otherwise, best sole socks I've bought. I wish they were cheaper, but they serve a unique purpose and they do it quite well.
B00AW5PCRE|5|These fit perfectly and seem to be of good quality.  I am a bigger man and was concerned that the size would not be right.
B00KTY1J5W|4|Seem well made. Run just a little bit large.
B00GAG5QQ6|3|It runs very small
B0092PBF4O|5|Very nice looking hoody, it's a light jacket with a removeable hood. I Have not worn it yet becaues I want to wash it by hand. I am not sure how it would hold up in the washing machine.
B00QOMO99G|1|Was excited about this shirt cuz Ms. Monroe is GORGEOUS!!! And I like the portrait with the tats, makes her look badass!! But... Got it, washed it, dried it, and now Ms. Monroe looks like Gramma Monroe:( the print bubbled and wrinkled so now she looks like she would if she were still alive( not that I discriminate against the elderly) but CMON MAN!!! The pic is attached
B0059Q2RII|5|Great. My daughter loves it!
B00LOBZDZQ|1|Don't waste your money. They are too small. I ordered a large they fit the size of a medium.
B00B7RZR44|5|Very cute
B00JUMDM0E|3|a bit lightweight.
B00QYTGGWW|5|loved it
B00I87ZBSI|4|Cute dress but it's a burnt orange color, not bright orange as shown.  (My screen is calibrated and it looks like a fun, summerish orange color, but it's actually more of an autumn color.)
B00IABS760|5|Love it
B00E0I8VJA|2|It looked huge when I opened the package but when I put it on it was WAY TOO TIGHT around my chest. And I even followed the guideline for measurements when ordering. It's also a little stiff...
B000F3JJMW|4|The hair looks like the picture although a bit thinner.  It's important to have someone look at the hair from behind to makes sure the wig cap underneath is covered.
B00M2V11UI|5|Looks great and washed well. My husband is 6'4&#34; so it's very hard to find shirts that are long enough yet not ridiculously wide. This one fits him very well and he loves wearing it. I purchased the green color and it looks great! I wish I'd bought more...
B009AH6K58|5|This is my second purchase and love it. The garment holds me in and lifts the butt. Will order again.
B00JPG1NQU|3|Though this is a very cute dress it runs small and the length is not as long as shown in the picture. Also its a little see through. The dress is not lined so you can see the fold over seems in the dress.
B007YJ5QY0|5|I bought this for my 7 year old daughter to wear for Halloween.  I tried it on her and it fit great.  She is small for her age so I was worried.  The tail has an elastic loop I wasn't sure what to do with.  There are no directions so I didn't know how I was supposed to attach it.  But, since my daughter is small, the elastic loop stretched and we put it around her waist and that was perfect.  But otherwise, for an older kid, I have no idea how you would attach the tail to an outfit.<br />My daughter is going to look super cute for Halloween this year.
B008L0LPNM|2|I have been looking for a basic black tank top and thought I would find it in this one.  Sadly, this one did not fit the bill.<br /><br />PROS:  color<br /><br />CONS:  Too small, rode up under my arms (chaffing), nearly see through, quality, mostly spandex, feel was &#34;knitty&#34; and would not hold up to several washings, was not as long as shown in the pictures, not warm
B0012ZAUO8|4|Fit not quite what I expected but works.  Cup slightly larger than expected.  But well made and arrived quickly.
B002HJ3DGA|5|Finding socks that stay up and not fall down is such a challenge. (I just read that folding your socks helps keeps the elastic tight) These socks are long enough but not too long and are just the right thickness. not too thick to affect the fit of the shoe but thick enough to keep your tootsies warm.
B00J7Z0M3E|3|He's jeans are all wonderful.  I am a huge fan of the brand.  However there has been some inconsistencies in sizing.  These are at least a full size too large.  Got the very same short, same size in med blue, also too big but not as big.  So very disappointed.  Want to try again a size snaller, but not sure if I want to risk it.
B0007YR9M6|3|I'll see if I can return this. I've worn this model before, but ordered it in the wrong size.
B004N7BQ86|4|Great
B00FB76CS6|5|Everything about it was excellent!
B003YC147Y|5|I haven't worn it yet, but I tried it on.  Thought I would give some impressions.  The mask is very  high quality for the price, behind the rubber exterior is a hard shell that fits over your face, similar to a hockey mask.  It is very sturdy and there is some room between your face and the mask for air to circulate. I have a big head and I had no need to use the optional included self-adhesive padding.  It's not difficult to operate the mouth, you simply open your mouth wide and your jaw powers it. The hard shell gives it structure so the rubber doesn't flop around like many rubber masks do..it's very taut. The hood material is nice and thick, and it also has a velcro closure. I'm very pleased with this mask.<br /><br />I would recommend that you view the instructional videos on You Tube look for CaliforniaCostumes and the mask name. They have tips on how to operate and troubleshoot any issues.
B00A8F35J0|5|Perfect fit for my daughter, she is very happy with it and has worn it pretty much every day since receiving it.<br />Easy to wash and colors stayed true with no shrinkage.
B00BC640Q6|4|I love this bikini. It is so cute and sexy. The only problem was it's a little tight and I usually wear mediums, but I can still wear it.
B00PV2CBZE|5|Got this for my 8 year old daughter she loves it!
B00GHXDZ6A|5|Perfect
B00J3QHKWS|3|I bought it originally for about 45$, but the zipper was messed up so I had to get a refund. I went to buy it again, and now it's 60$!!!!!
B00N3YID40|5|I recently bought this Hoodie for myself, I'm a huge pokemon fan and I really thought about getting a jacket that resembled one of my favorite pokemon! It's an amazing jacket, it's really warm and soft too. I ordered a large but got an XL, which is fine because I realized the large would have been too small, all in all its a really nice jacket.
B008R6U2KW|5|I bought these for my son and he loves them because he says they don't ride up.  They hold up well in the wash!
B0058VRCES|5|My daughter loves them!!!
B00FR9AWF2|4|Tighter and less stretchy than I expected. However, VERY slimming. Also, the navy color, small dots, and slim fit of these Capri pants are kind of beatnik.
B00Q82ERAS|5|Color was beautiful and dress very well made. Loved it.
B007C4GHS6|5|A+
B00GOFJB0K|5|great quality shirt. crisp image. delivered promptly. will look for this company again
B005GNOPDO|5|fit was to the T
B0018Q58M0|5|Fit perfect
B008CD5PQQ|5|I took a gamble I figured for $50 why not. I'm 6'4 200 so hard to find those tall thin sizes but this coat was perfect in XL fits slim especially in the shoulders. Charcoal cooler looks cool and is different than my other black peacoat. I've already recommended to friends
B00BF72OI8|1|To small
B00GCFAEFI|5|Love it! Comfy and I forget I'm wearing it!
B001T6F5QS|5|Fits perfectly! The only dislikes are that the hooks in the back poke through sometimes when I move and the wires are too high on the sides so they sometimes jab my underarms.
B000OEZPDY|5|Same as above...................013/09/28/ your -money/health-in suranc  e/a -guide-to-  new Haggar Men's Cool 18 Gabardine Hidden Expandable Waist Pleat Front... Haggar Men's Cool 18 Gabardine Hidden Expandable Waist Pleat Front...
B003VND0PA|3|the socks are well constructed but the leg section with it's stretch fabic is so tight it almost feels like it is cutting off circulation
B000NRWWD8|5|Great quality for a very low price.
B003PC07TY|5|Good quality bra. Nice fir
B00JABR99U|4|Great for training. Some of the elastic inside gets twisted in the waist band.
B00FJ1TU88|5|Serves the purse, looks absolutely neat, and pretty affordable, Yeah, you should get one of those if you ain't done that already!
B0087A74WM|5|Hola quisiera saber si este terno en talla 14 viene con la camisa y la corbata.<br /><br />Espero sus noticias,<br /><br />Gracias<br />[[ASIN:B0087A74WM Joey Couture Boys 8-20 Pinstripe Suit]]
B00M0IJVYQ|3|These pants seemed like fairly nice quality pants, but the sizing was a bit weird. They gapped a lot at the waist, were tight around the hips, and seemed baggy in the thighs and lower leg. Just not right for my body shape--I had to send them back.
B00R838X6U|5|Love them. Very comfortable.
B00IXQG12O|5|adorable!
B00HH5FN9E|2|not as expected, but durable- size charts can be improved - maybe a different size will do better next time
B002OT1X06|1|The label reads \\"Heavy Cotton\\", but the material looks and feels super cheap. I think they may have accidentally used cheese cloth. It's paper thin and low quality. In a word: garbage. I still want a Dunder Mifflin t-shirt and so... I'll have to keep looking and buy something else. You should keep looking, too, and pass on this Old Glory cheapo.
B007GDVLF2|4|Bought this because I loved the Mini-Series, even bought the music. I hope they finish the rest of the Series.
B00FPHXUVY|5|I have ways been satisfied with products from Pattys Boutik. Good d quality and fits perfect as always . I have more orders on the way.
B00K5T4NHC|5|I really was surprised at the quality of this shirt considering the decent price point.  It's quite similar in style to the types of shirts my son purchases for when he's engaged in any sports-related activity.  The \\"polyester interlock\\" is a type of stitching / weave that makes the shirt look the same on both sides.<br /><br />The stitching is excellent and there's extra piping along the back of the neck where it would get the most wear and tear, something that will extend the life of the shirt.  There's no tag to aggravate the wearer.  I have zero complaints as to the quality of the shirt whatsoever as it's topnotch in every way.<br /><br />The look is awesome.  I must say that the eye-popping color and fit look totally awesome on my husband (he has the orange).  With the 100% polyester, it doesn't get that wrinkled look within minutes of wearing and is quite stylish.  The sizing is very accurate, something I most certainly appreciate.<br /><br />Moisture wicks away from his body in these warm summer days.  Because the polyester is a thin material, it's naturally cooler to wear.  No stains on it as of yet, but there's such a thing as stain remover.  I love the eye-popping color, the fit, and he loves the soft, comfort it affords.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.
B00PDYG9O4|5|Got my flags 1 day before the ealiest day projected.  Got all the different Olive drab, Subdued , Stardard and Desert. !st rate quality same as issued for deployment !  Got all mine reverse to fly proudly on combat unit /right arm.  I love when I fine a vendor that hits it out of the park like this. Perfect product at bargain price !
B0017MBXVA|2|very average material that will need to be carefully treated and do not expect it to last long!<br />But it might!
B00QNF79Z0|5|Love it
B00D8ZUD8I|5|Will save them.  He will enjoy them at a later date
B00LUF00WC|5|My daughter was really excited when she got this for her birthday. She wants to wear it all the time and tells me it's really comfy.
B00OULDK0W|4|I got this to put over my other jackets on very cold winter nights.  I love the way it looks.  It's thin, but pretty warm.  I wore it by itself one winter night, and it worked fine.  Took a star off because it has a gross factory smell, even after being washed.  Not sure how many washes it can handle, but it held up fine.  The material looks pretty flimsy, though, but I'm not picky.  Delivered at expected time.
B00LLIVQM6|4|I like it, it's good quality, doesn't have a super strong smell, but I moved to second set of hooks in a matter of 3 days so kinda sad I have to dish out more money for a smaller one much sooner than expected.<br />(I guess that's a good thing though, right?! haha)<br />I have noticed my waist shrinking in the 2 weeks I've used it.
B00GI24YI8|4|Great
B00OCGLKX4|4|Fits well, and good old oxford blue.
B00CDIER2E|3|Very rough fabric.  I use extra fabric softner on them to help, but are still a bit rough.  That being said, these things are well built and get the job done.
B000783Z5M|4|These shorts were perfect for workouts and looked good enough to wear in all casual settings. They washed perfectly with no shrinking. Highly recommend them to all.
B00CQBMJU0|5|Loved them
B000MXQ2AW|5|I've been wearing Haggar pants since they first came out with the stretch waist band, great idea that makes pants comfortable to wear all day, even during the holidays when you need a little extra stretch after those big meals. Thanks Haggar!
B000SM4ZGK|4|It seems to be good quality, but I would have liked more hair for the price.
B00KQ3CSJC|5|These fit perfectly, and they seem to be really well made. I'm 5'9&#34; / 5'10&#34; and medium fit me perfectly, they're definitely long enough.
B00QBOPHIO|4|I thought the green would be olive / army green but it's not… it's more hunter green, but still cute.
B00B78LY9U|4|Bought as a gift.  Have no idea if they fi, what the material quality was or anything else about this garment.  All I heard was Thanks!
B00LIF0Z4M|5|They are perfect.  Great fit and length.
B00HF1J3OG|5|Yes, these pants are very nice, good heavy quality. Good for active boys. I would recommend them. They look good on my 5 year old.
B001JIMCL2|3|I loved the looks and price of this bra when I purchased it. Unfortunately, it cut in too high and tight under my arms, and was uncomfortable for me to keep. I don't know that's the bra's fault-it is just the way I am.
B00HJO9VVY|4|Excellent quality, looked exactly like expected.  Colors nice an washes well.  Very happy with purchase overall. Would buy again for fure
B00IGVAZPU|2|Too small didn't for well
B00IXF9J2O|5|Like it Alot!
B004DEOCMG|5|SO much better than the ones you find at the department store.  Heavy weight; more traction spots; like the ankle height; pack of three economical.  I wear these everyday as I have hardwood floors and did slip 3 years ago...no more.
B007JA9VXG|4|Costume it true to size. My daughter looks adorable and I know she will be warm as we go trick or treating. My only minor complaint is that the petals have a difficult time standing upright and flop over. Other than that great costume for a great price.
B00UWHS7GA|5|This is a great slimming shaper. It's a tank top with a corset underneath. I say a corset, because there's really no other word, because it has the snaps with different sizes, just like a corset does. The shaper is attached to the tank top, and you can't remove it. I was expecting two pieces, but it's really all connected together. This is nice, because it really all fits together well, and it makes it so that people can't tell that you're wearing a girdle.<br /><br />I thought it was extremely easy to put on, especially compared to other corsets. There aren't any pokey areas that are too firm, so the clasps easily clasp together. It's really easy to take off and it's really easy to put on. Also, it looks really good when it's on. It works really well, too, and it encourages good posture. If you're looking to appear slimmer, this is a great device for it.<br /><br />I would size up, just so that you can get the front to close all of the way. Then it doesn't look so much like a corset.
B00BGUQ5HU|5|super hot looking wife loves them holds my stuff great gives a great look they look great in bed or out gives nice look under a pair of thin pants
B00VTVYIKW|3|This was for my wife and even though it has Jeep in pink, it is a mens sized hat...a little misleading.
B0089E3YWK|4|Received item in a good time frame with free shipping.  Ordered both hot pink and white in size large.  The hot pink is vibrant and what I expected.  The fit is great as well.  I am between a medium and a large and figured I would go up a size in case it shrunk in the dryer.  The hot pink color fit wonderfully but for some reason the white one which is also a size large was really tight.  The arms were suffocating as well as see through (which I kind of expected) but the fitting is way off for the white one versus the hot pink.  Overall a great cardigan but I'm not sure if I should order large or extra-large for the other colors I want.
B00MPZXVQ8|5|These are great coverage but run a little snug compared to my other size large cotton bras.
B00KH6GVDC|3|Love the style and fabric of this dress but it's way too big especially in the chest - will be returning.
B0012ISQRI|5|This is on the uniform list for my daughters' school.  They wore this same skort last year & I paid $15 ea from the local uniform supplier.  So when I got these for $9 ea, I ordered right away for this coming fall.  They are 4.5 yrs old & each weight 42-45 lbs.  They wore the size 4 last year & I ordered the 5s for the fall.  They are a little big right now, but sure they'll be fine for fall.  Washes really well, no ironing needed ;-)  Great item!!!
B00HA0SYRO|5|Love the feel of this scarf and the print is beautiful.
B00DNVIAEG|1|I had been on a shopping spree and thought I could find nice inexpensive dresses to add to my new collection. I am very disappointed to say the least. The dress is too tight, the fabric is very cheap and the quality is left to be desired. I don't think I could even give it away to anyone. Disappointed....I guess when something looks to good to be true, believe it.
B00L8WBCY2|4|I LISTENED TO THE OTHER REVIEWS AND ORDERED 2 SIZES UP.  I AM NORMALLY A LARGE SO I ORDERED A XXL.  THE BOTTOMS FIT AMAZING!! HOWEVER, I AM A LITTLE SMALLER UP TOP SO THE TOP IS A LITTLE TOO BIG. NOT A HUGE DEAL SINCE IT WAS ONLY $23. I JUST WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER RED TOP AT TARGET THAT FITS!
B0032C2ZQA|1|Bewild sent me a rusted skull pile chain so I can not give a good rating . Also with this company you will not get your shipping and handling fee back even when it was their fault by sending out a product that they can clearly see the rust through their packaging.<br />BEWILD JUST SENT ME AN E-MAIL STATING THEY WILL PAY BACK MY SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEE THE ALSO SAID THEY WERE SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE BUT THEN AGAIN THIS PROBLEM SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED. I SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAVE HAD TO FIGHT FOR THE SHIPPING AND FEE RETURN!!!!  date 4/3/12
B00B1JMHH8|5|So I've been looking for gardening pants for a while, and most are just junk, really just cargo trousers usually designed for men, but sold to women. These are different. First up, they are pretty. I know it shouldn't matter, but it does and it's nice that they considered that. The material is robust but also soft and comfortable, I wear these for slouching around the house, as well as gardening. The pockets are numerous and in handy locations. They are also a great fit. I have a three month old, and no personal trainer, so I need them to sit comfortably over my waist ( I think I can still call it a waist!) and they do. They are not below the hip pants, which seems to be all the rage. They also take a belt, incase I ever get my figure back, so all in all highly recommended. Oh and I had to deal with the company on a different matter and they got back to me quickly and efficiently, which is a big plus in my book. Will definitely buy more from Garden Girl.
B00P169NTM|5|Purchased for my father who turned 80 this year and he loves it!  Classy and fun without being obnoxious.
B00E0ES6BW|5|fits as expected. great price and really nice quality - I won't feel so bad if it gets ruined in daily boy play outside at the price!
B001WPM27Q|5|Love these socks
B00B455WQ2|5|Perfect.
B002WGEJKM|5|I was a little hesitant to purchase these socks as I've never went with Hanes for socks and typically don't buy them online.<br /><br />The socks, after being washed, are a tad bit large for my feet - I wear 10's for my shoe size. If I pull them up on my ankles, however, they fit snug and are warm, thick, and comfortable.<br /><br />Very satisfied with this purchase.
B00L8KS60C|3|its cute, good for the price but its too short.
B00EWASFQA|2|The top was too small, I know that it isn't the size I ordered. So now I have a cute bottom with no top! :(
B007NOEWV4|5|I've had my credit card compromised twice before I purchased a set for my husband and myself. I shop worry free now.
B00M1YB7W8|2|Based on the size chart I ordered a 6 but there's no way its passing my hip. Had it passed my hips it would have been a great boy shorts with support. Funny though it doesn't say maidenform on it
B00440CYD8|5|I guess it is working out for my SIL. I havent heard any complaints, and it was easier to monogram than I thought it would be.
B00AO49DKU|3|These capris were not exactly what I expected.  They collect a lot of lint & the waiste fits kinds weird.  I wear them to work but they are certainly not my favorites.
B00HET8WAK|5|Fits great.  Looks good.  Should keep me warm this winter.
B0094UDVYY|5|Great product. This is all I will buy now!
B00RZHXL70|2|When you actually see the wash on these jeans in person it will remind you of some acid washed 90s jeans. Haven't wore these out in public at all.
B00FKD3Q6M|5|They came right on time and fit exactly as I expected! I'm extremely happy with them!<br />I went a size up and bought a medium because I wasn't sure how accurate the sizing would be and it seemed like the logical thing to do. Turns out they're sizing is spot on and I should've gone with a small (and in fact, I think I'll buy another pair in a size small!) but I'm still very happy with the medium fit and am most definitely keeping them. They're sooo comfortable, the material is fantastic, and I felt fabulous wearing them all night long, I got many a compliment on them.
B00TT52U3M|5|Love this cover up! Very flattering.
B00JE49EJG|5|This scarf is sheer, nice for spring and summer.  I recommend this style  to anyone who likes a long scarf and the color &#34; blue&#34;.  It is very pretty.
B005KNCYT2|2|I was extremely disappointed when I realized how small it was.  I can't use it because it is very small.  I'm going to give it to my daughter for my grandson.
B00FYSIZVY|4|I really like the material and how it fits, but it is a little long for me.  After rolling the waistband it is about the right length.  I am 5'4&#34;.
B00DVDFHI8|5|These bibs are amazing. Snap closure (after three kids, we know how terrible the velcro closures are), superior absorbency, and perfect sizing. I consider Silly Billyz to be the best bibs out there (and Mum2Mum is right up there too!)
B000OBZ668|4|these fit well, will see how they hold up... I seem to wear thru pants quickly, but Levi's hopefully will last longer than most of the off brands have
B00M3RYTFA|5|got one for my mom also
B009P9IVRQ|5|color is as you see it, fits nice, cozy and can go casual or fancy.
B00CJBV91C|5|Great
B00EKQAJII|5|Love the dress
B00KQGJQDU|5|I'd liked. Has a nice size for girl over 5-7 years old.
B00EOJR7CC|4|fit perfectly.  just what we needed.
B00O1D6SDU|2|I have very narrow feet and two out of the six pair were so tight I could not get them over my heels.  The other four pair were fine - a little snug but not uncomfortable.  If someone had regular width feet or wide feet, I'm not sure they could wear them.  They are also rather thin and a bit scratchy.  However, the patterns and colors look cute peeking out from under my jeans (which is why I added the second star).
B00AKFYUVA|2|This snowsuit had to be returned-- Even though we measured the baby according to manufacturers guidelines; It was Way too big.
B00D1HKTYG|5|Embrace Lace is the best bra going.  It is pretty, comfortable and worth every penny.  The wide range of sizes means a good fit for a variety of body types.
B00D3P9CJY|1|size is not correct. Too big.<br />Quality is terrible. I never tell anyone of his friends would not advise to buy this item. NOT corresponds price. I just lost money
B006YD3ZI6|5|This nursing bra is great! I wore this every day while nursing until it fell apart and then I bought a second one. I highly recommend it.
B00H3L63JQ|5|Great, and super cute on my adorable fiance!
B0087Y654Q|5|My daughter had chosen a Carhart Coat and found this one on Amazon.  I decided to get it for her for Christmas.  It is great quality and comfort and she wears it to do her farm chores.  Thanks Amazon for great items!
B00MCK1BMM|5|Beautiful dress!  My Granddaughter looked beautiful in it for Christmas day.
B00DI0OQUE|5|Great on our Halloween Dummy,  just wait till people see who we have in the Stocks.
B00HHTFYNA|3|Da cotton material is not good. But the tutu is really cute and good quality. Really cute, just like the picture
B00C40V26K|3|Waist band is thick and does flip down when bending or sitting.
B00D52YU2E|5|This hat is so RAD! I am a huge Ramones fan and own a lot of clothing and memorabilia from them. This hat is my new favorite! I like to pair it with my Johnny Ramone Vans or Converse Ramones hi tops.
B003JH8SXM|1|I bought this item because it looks very nice on picture. It arrived on time, but when product was open, It was a big disappointment. Color not as picture, even after brushing it, it will never look like the one on the picture. Wife was very mad with this present. One more thing, if you are brown skin, it will look ugly on you.
B00L0VAIXM|3|Wear a 32 waist. Ordered 34. They fit like a tight 32.
B00QUKROL2|3|The jacket is amazing! Soft comfy just a great jacket.. However there are two sizing charts Amazon and the Company who is selling a sweater. The correct measurements are in the description not in the sizing chart underneath the sweater. so when I ordered this I ordered thinking it was going to be big because I wanted to bake but I'm being way too small I couldn't fit into it. Because it shipped from Hong Kong I can either pay postage to send it back or I could get a $6 refund and keep it for a friend or family member. I took the six dollar refund and gave it to your friend.. Just check before you buy make sure you're looking at the right sizing chart this is an amazing sweater but you do want to fit!
B005N0FOUI|5|I receive it nice and fast. I'm excited to make my husband wear this on Christmas party. Love it so much!
B00J2U732M|5|I was a 34A before pregnancy.  I am exclusively breastfeeding and have not gotten measured professionally (no time!).  However, I ordered two of these bras in Small Blush from the Macy's sale and they seem to fit perfectly.  The blush color is a nice departure from nude, and doesn't show under white shirts.  The removable extra padding is a nice touch, as I hate the &#34;headlights&#34; look.  I use Bamboobies nursing pads and they don't show through either, which is nice.  This is a breathable fabric that doesn't make my skin itch.  I bought a couple bras from the Target sale but returned them because they were so itchy!  I don't have sensitive skin either.  I will definitely order more of these even to wear when I am not breastfeeding!  Great buy.
B003IXE3B8|1|The item arrived with the size 3t imprinted on them however they were way too big!! I have never seen a 3t this big before and they were more likely to fit an 8 year old then a 3 year old.
B007VUKHHS|2|The robe is pretty thin and not plush or soft as other people described. Better off buying elsewhere for better quality.
B005901R62|4|Loved the jeans. Fits like a glove. Sits below the waist a tad.  The color was what I was looking for. I would highly recommend these jeans.
B00MA4NO48|3|I didn't read enough of the reviews when ordered....runs VERY small. Like the garment, simply does not fit.  Out of country distributor which makes return challenging at a minimum.
B00O18BIC6|3|I bought a large after reading reviews and it's too big. I'm 140 lbs and wear 7/8 in juniors.
B008N90J0Q|1|The dress is very beautiful, but the size I ordered came totally wrong. I would recommend the product to people who can make change. As I am from Brazil and went to the United States to catch the dress, I can not make change.
B00M8Z6WKM|3|A little long and I'm 6ft tall
B00FBF43DY|5|very good
B00N6R5FO0|5|Nice shirt!  Great Price!
B008H8MQWW|2|The fabric of these is stiff and thinner than the other pair of pink striped ones we bought.  The snap came apart immediately.  poor quality!
B00LVRF15K|4|Nice! Thanks
B00CONNGVQ|5|Love it!
B009WOZIR0|5|I'd been looking for a thick, 100% wool sweater for some time, especially after the extremely cold and snowy winter of 2013/2014, and I got just what I wanted! I ordered the tweed sweater, which arrived much sooner than the expected 4-6 week delivery time (it took just over two weeks to get here). The product looks exactly as shown in the pictures. The color is spot on, the wool is very thick, the knit appears to be high quality and the stitching on the shoulder and elbow patches is firm. Like a lot of other reviewers, I will note that this sweater definitely runs larger than I expected - I normally wear a large, but the medium probably would have worked. In spite of this, the sweater looks great on me and does a fantastic job keeping me warm. The first day I wore it was in the middle of a snowstorm with temperatures below freezing, but this sweater kept me warm and cozy. The only drawback I see to this product is the typical itchiness you would expect from real wool, but since I knew to expect this it didn't bother me all that much. All told, I think this is a great sweater, probably the best one I own, and I look forward to wearing it for a long time.
B00M21OSGW|2|However, i went by the reviews. and i found that it was too big. should have went down a size for a better fit. but i kept it, good back support and girdle-minded material.
B008T0HB8M|2|Cool shirt design, but for $32.50 for a T-Shirt I would have expected an American made shirt. Instead I received a very lightweight cotton shirt made in El Salvador, which would have been fine had it cost $9.95.<br />Not sure how long it will last being made of such lightweight cotton.
B00FBMD3S8|5|This is one of my favorite verses. To have it on my checkbook is awesome.  The quality of the product is excellent.  I plan to order more to family and friends.
B00CRW9Y1U|3|Not good quality also it was smaller then expected
B00O10ZTSI|4|i bought size 5/6  for muy son (4,5 years old) but its a little bit small for him. Any way - he likes it so much. so he didn't give me to change a size. he put it in the moment it comes.<br />and looks great!
B00CXMYL8A|4|Alright, but smaller than expected. Doesn't have back pocket as listed, only front 2
B00TGS2A2S|4|Comfy soft shirt
B00NWDH24Y|4|it was a little short, but great fit.
B00IN9KATQ|4|For a very small skirt, you get what you want! The &#34;foil&#34; material is a slightly shiny, slightly plastic-y fabric. This is a great little skirt to wear over some boyshorts for pole fitness, as there's no excess fabric to get in the way!
B0085C7IA0|3|This is a cute, cool & comfy little dress, although the hemline is so uneven that I wouldn't wear it out in public.  I keep it on a hook near the front door so that unexpected visitors won't see me wearing shorts!  I do think the price + shipping fees make this dress more expensive than its appearance warrants.
B007KOF78Y|4|I seriously love this hoodie! I had it in my wish list for awhile, it went on sale so I had to order it! PROS- fits as expected, was not tight, color is as pictured & it's super cute.  CONS- the material is thinning, which is disappointing but I still love it
B003XT92YU|5|I am such a great picker I love this sun dress its not a heavy material so summer here I come
B00II73GCG|1|Way to small. I wasted my money. I recommend this if it was 3 times as big this was like 5 sizes to small
B00IGI6NB8|5|when the going gets weird....the weird turn pro
B00I1APZ6U|3|Too warm for area, I sent back as they are lined. Otherwise seem very well made.
B00BBQJ6IE|3|I bought a variety of sizes in this Sleep N Play, because it is so easy to take off when cleaning baby.  All of the sizes seem to shrink in the torso area rather quickly.
B003NX8CIS|5|Light weight, but warm jacket. Perfect for 45 degrees and up. Nicely made and good quality construction.
B00R7AGVUY|5|Excellent...for the price simply can't beat.  Very stretchy, I wear a medium and it's fine.
B00A2XVVAI|5|pretty printed bathing suit with really soft and beautiful tassels. good quality fabric that will last me through at least two seasons. the suit is classy and funky at the same time. love it!
B00LOPGL2G|5|This is a very lightweight hoodie which was what I was looking for.  It's nice material and comfortable.  Fits as expected but if you're looking for something heavy to wear in the winter this isn't the one you want.  Living in southern California makes this a perfect choice for those semi chilly nights.
B0018OHJHO|5|I love these jeans. I feel hot and sexy in them. Not sure anyone else thinks I do, but does that really matter?    Great jeans. I'm 6ft 170 and really like how they fit by body.     I've now bought 3 pair.
B00864RUF0|5|Very nice and fast shipping.
