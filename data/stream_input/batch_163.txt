B00PZUAHZS|5|Really nice Fob. Perfect fit for the key to my 2015 Forester. Looks great and protects the key from spills.
B000H2W270|5|the magnet is powerful and should stick to your car at high speeds. I've heard if this whip for the CB even way back in my younger days when I first got started in CD radios
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works like its suppose to in my mid size SUV; just like a gem.  I like it.
B00FEXE0BI|5|Had to do some minor drilling on bumper but it came out looking pretty good.
B004K25IC4|3|I got a soft top and haven't even installed this yet.
B00H7JEQAM|2|It works but was cracked where it fits into satellite
B00199BXXY|5|Truck threw a code that referenced the sensor location on my truck. Exact fit for what my truck needed. Friend helped me install since he has more experience with these installs. Cleared code on truck with the code reader then started it and its working fine with no repeat code...
B012MZGKOU|5|Just to start off, I have previously owned an OBD2 dongle purchased from another website and was very dissapointed with it. It didnt work properly with all my cars and it was large in size. This OBD2 was different though.<br /><br />Firstly, it includes a software CD which includes the Torque app for both iOS and Android phones and tablets, and a program for the computer. It is much easier to connect to this device because it uses WIFI to connect, as opposed to bluetooth which requires you to pair and enter passcodes. The included CD provides directions on how to copy the Torque app to your phone.<br /><br />To connect to the device, all you do is plug it into the OBD2 port in your car, which is usually located under the steering wheel somewhere, and press the ON button. Then turn on your phones WIFI and look for the &#34;WIFI_OBDll&#34; connection and connect. No password needed.<br />Once connected, you can open up the Torque app and configure the adapter settings. Change the connection type to WIFI.<br /><br />From the app you will be able to check for fault codes or clear a &#34;check engine light&#34;. You can even track your trips with the app viewing them on a map showing you your location and trip information.<br /><br />I really loved the ability to view real time engine and vehicle parameters such as Acceleration, RPMs, Throttle, Speed, Boost, Coolant Level.<br />It will even record your fastest 0-60 speeds!<br />It is so convenient!
B008B5TVC4|5|I was annoyed with the buzzer sound of the old sensor and replace it. They slightly enhanced the design of the sensor but I'm happy about the result.
B00387QW7C|5|absolutely great!!
B0009IQZH0|5|Good product
B000CSRA1M|5|as expected
B00TENYBTA|5|awesome piece of work
B002305RZ8|5|work great.
B00771YX1C|5|great!
B000BYAOA6|5|very nice piece. comes with HEI style cap.
B00A57ZOIG|4|Nice fitment
B00FFXXXTC|5|works great
B00SC1054K|5|Perfect
B000C30J3I|5|Amazing belt. Had some work done at the shop and they replaced the old belt with an OEM one.. squeaked horribly! I tried the test of squirting water on it to verify its the belt..the OEM one silenced. I went to every auto part store in 20 miles of home and not one of them carried this..had to order from Amazon and once I got it had it swapped out in 5 minutes on my 2000 Blazr ZR2 4.3 vortec... not one squeak since!  Kept the OEM in the truck for an emergency spare. Will stock up a few of these for all vehicles I own.<br /><br />I am seriously a GatorBack customer for life.. and cant think why no stores carry them anywhere town.
B000HAEPSG|5|Does what it is supposed to do!
B00KFS11W8|5|Exactly what I need for my GMC Terrain 2013
B00GXJHQAO|5|Worked great fit my abarth so my 500 madness intake fits right.
B0027M4SRU|5|Excellent
B00911F374|5|great product. looks better than oem.simple to install on original strut with tools provided.
B00I3RCKJQ|5|Like the OEM
B0078TP6XM|5|Very happy with how my Cardinals detail looks. Will hopefully purchase more from  Amazon.
B00Y4XKR48|5|Good item & price
B00Y3H4U6Q|1|to small for 2 screws on the bracket
B00L7E80IW|1|This is not tempo tissue. Very disappointed!
B0052FRG28|5|The price and services was excellent and the part perfect thank you guy's!
B006J627T6|5|Works well
B004GZ8V9W|5|Fit 2002 Hyundai Sonata as advised. Installed and charged system. All seems to be working well at this point - 2 days after install.
B00MPQJ8CI|1|Pretty awful job on what you'd think would be an easy item to produce. The mask itself comes misaligned. Unlike the picture above, the left and right halves are off by a VERY noticeable amount. Could be that I just got a dud but I think it's even worse that a dud can even happen out of something so simple to make.
B0031I5Z8U|5|Good price.<br />Nice stout looking product.<br />Fast delivery
B00OBWOOWI|5|Works great on my Diavel
B0033D99BW|5|Worked exactly as it should. Good firm seal and securely attached to factory plug without issue.
B007R4HBM2|5|My husband(shaved head) is a huge beannie wearer in the cooler months and he likes for them to fit snuggly to his head without being floppy~~this was perfect! Very soft knit, patch is firmly sewn into place, and all around great construction. I will look to Hot Leathers for future hoodie and beannie purchases!
B0016I9XMQ|5|This is a direct bolt on hitch receiver.  Was very easy to install.  The hardest thing I had to do was remove the old hitch ball that was rusted onto my bumper.  Already used it to tow an International Scout II just over 170 miles through heavy rain.  I highly recommend this receiver.
B0022Y67C2|5|you would be crazy not to install this with the PC5
B00J594B5C|5|Great Product for surface rust on my van.
B00GDF3MP6|3|IT IS A STICKER, I was expecting better quality. Although, after install, it is asthetically pleasing  from far away. Once up close you can tell the sticker does not align perfectly with the bow tie. I did NOT perform a &#34;wet install&#34; so that could possibly make it easier to do  overall I am very pleased with the color and the way it looks, but if your looking for more quality look somewhere else.
B0066SJ18W|5|Purchased this for a 1999 328i E46. It fits just like OEM. Only time will tell if it lasts.
B00JXYHAX4|5|Just had the compressor installed and it works great.
B008OYALHQ|5|Good product and great price!! The clamps were not good though.
B006M4AOCC|5|my car, milo, is so much happier now with real floor mats. it fits a little odd in the back seat, but who cares? now i can track wet dirt and mud into my car!
B00IMOCIUQ|4|Very nice people to deal with, i had to return something and aside from having to pay to ship out of the US, they were nice.
B00DJWBIY8|5|Must have to set off Seahawks plate frames
B001F0GFQW|1|Buy the factory Yamaha part!
B0023W1HMI|5|great
B005MVBGE6|3|I like the tester for checking sensor at wheel ,but for other test to check harness you still need other equipment check more in depth. At 200.00 dollars to basicly check wheel sensors I could put that towards euipment that can check each wheel anyway.
B00NTR458Y|5|Incredibly bright both during day and night. Only flaw was the switch mode button was missing.
B00U90AG64|5|Love it going to buy another one thanks
B00X952IZI|5|nice sticker decal
B003YOXUT2|5|it matched his model year, went in smoothly, and works perfectly. Excellent product and service.
B000LG9M1Q|5|The keyless remote came with easy steps about how to program it. It has been working great!
B00CIB1HNI|3|When I pasted the sticker the LABORATORIES part didn't completely stick. So, I ended up just taking that part of the sticker out entirely still looks pretty sick though.
B000J3B142|5|Camo looks great. Seems well made to me. Water proof on the outside, lightly padded and lined with felt on the inside, great for your fragiles. As far as size, they may be a hair smaller than my old ones that I never could fill up anyway, but all four bags have the mesh on the front which holds quite a bit of stuff too. Small straps on the side are good for clipping on things like a multitool or I slide the clip of my flashlight in there and it hasn't fallen off yet, always right there for easy access.
B000BZXGUU|5|I have a Infiniti G35 sport sedan, my previous hawk brake pads had massive dust.  I am very happy with these pads, all pads will eventually produce some dusts, but these are minimal.  As long as the install is correct, these pad are quiet and good on dust, along with the great price, highly recommended.  I have had these for 2 months now.
B00REJXHIM|5|Easy to install and fit my 2015 Tacoma short bed perfectly.
B0009IQXCM|5|Love Meguiars products.  Will use again and again.
B006HZKZSO|5|Great price
B00QSNZJGI|4|nice galvanization.<br />Not very good quality.  Holes aren't round,  They do get the job done mechanically.  Given the effort in the finish of the through hole, i wonder how good the casting is.  Air pockets?  Good alloy?  Won't know unless they break and reveal their problems.. if I live to examine it.  They claim to be rated to 4.5 ton.  Hope it's honest.
B003NOAIHK|5|Looks good
B00COYNTNK|4|If your a Mickey/Disney fan you can't go wrong with this image. Super cute and does its job and that's coming from someone who lives in Las Vegas, 100 degrees avg in the summer. The only problem I have is when I recieved it the stiching is coming apart around the edges of the entire thing. I'm not one to deal with the hassle of returning it so I'll just keep it as is. All in all it does it's job. But for anyone else purchasing this it may be a risk you take in orderig one. Hope that helps, happy shopping!
B007R4GH1S|5|As pictured
B00EDL8P5O|5|Very nice. Easy installation
B0001EFSTI|5|It may not look like much, but this is by far my favorite multi-tool (even among leatherman & 10-tool units). Its the kind of tool that you can totally forget that you have on you, as the slim key design goes generally unnoticed. When you do need it, though, it meets most daily use demands without fuss (Bottle opener is tricky, but you get the hang of it). Great conversation starter as well.
B001G77IRY|5|Direct fit for my 2006 325i BMW
B00KWETDFM|1|Very deceptive.  You should have a picture of one lug nut.
B00GT0TSO4|5|Love them. My truck looks sweet with all of the chrome
B008G31B88|5|Made our 10 year old Toyota look great! Bulbs (included) are bright! Totally satisfied!
B00D42AFS8|1|This item work only once and now it will not keep a charge and is not returnable SMH
B00NC8LQAK|5|Nice clean plate cover looks great!
B00NZL8N96|1|This jumper is junk. It work for a few times then it wouldn't store enough energy to start a car. Now it's only use is charging mobile devices in the go and it's a bit too bulky for that.  Update: I received a replacement. After charging the unit it wouldn't jump start a car.
B0000AY69V|5|Love this product!
B000C5CEKC|1|This is a terribly cheap gas cap. I haven't had it for more than 2 months and the lock already seized. No matter how hard you try to turn the key it just wont budge. I even tried lock lubricant but its done for.
B000JWKJKA|5|these work perfect on my  DODGE SPRINTER 3500
B000TK3U4O|4|This light bulbs is without a doubt brighter and whiter than my stock headlight bulb but it is also NOT as white as my Custom Dynamics white/amber LED turn signal bulbs. If I was not currently into white LEDs for my motorcycles, I would buy this bulb again. This bulb is cheaper than LED headlight bulbs and it is a good value.
B000OUZB8C|5|Great value and quality.
B00029XD62|2|Easily scarred when I tried applying to vehicle window trim. Decent vinyl from the likes of 3M takes a lot of abuse before it shows any scarring, so skip this and go straight for quality materials.
B000765DI6|5|Works perfectly for attaching a bike rack on my Xterra
B0002SR63E|5|Very happy with product and service!
B001GCOBE2|4|Nice boots, cheap laces, however, easy fix.
B003ZNTB5E|4|Product Worked well and fit great.  Looked great on the car!
B00029X5VK|5|The best wipers money can buy.  I have been using them for years.  Nice clean wipes without chatters.  I had it on some my car for over 5 years, and they still work great.  It's worth the money!
B000VU7M4Q|5|Great price as well as great product.  Will do business with this seller again
B00KWLKSAO|2|Didn't fit any of my carburetors Every NT, speed carb and a CNS carb. Its very narrow. It didn't fit any if my petcocks stock or aftermarket.  Didn't bother returning it.
B00OJRIYIU|5|Decided to piss off my foreman and put this on the back of my hard hat, best money I'll ever spend
B000CB948Q|5|Fits my application perfectly (2001 Mercedes-benz C240).
B00H8DFKS4|1|Out of all the lights that xame in the pack only 2 actually worked/fit my vehicle so other words im not too happy with product.
B00K2QS3GK|3|For some reason I misunderstood the description and thought it was a &#34;sticker&#34; rather than a decal.
B00JQVTOJC|5|best rust preventive top coat you can get without paying for epoxy or powder-coat
B001G9O528|5|I have tried a number of aluminium polishing compounds, some liquid, some paste.<br />This is literally the best by a country mile. Outshines them all.
B00CASDZKC|1|Kick mat elastic straps were too short and wouldn't fit.  When I went to return them, it asked for  $7 return shipping.  Waste of money.
B00AHKJEKA|1|Wore this helmet once and once only. Whilst comfort wise it is OK, the amount of noise generated by this helmet was ludicrous. Even wearing 33db attenuation earplugs it was overwhelming. so, going cheap, worn only once.
B000CHNAWQ|2|Purchased Feb 2015 and the shaft broke August 2015. I am waiting to see how they cover their parts.
B00WPW6BAE|4|Wanted to know more about battery condition of my electric car. This works well with LeafSpy.<br /><br />It uses WiFi (it shows up as a Wifi hotspot), so it is only useful for some scenarios, as your other network connections fail when connected tp this unit (obviously). Could be useful to use an old and unused cell phone with Android on it if you want to do some data logging with LeafSpy.
B008QW96PY|5|Very good product. I love the ventillation through the mesh sides so it keeps your feet cool riding in hot weather. Also very comfortable.
B007VPWIX4|5|Exact match, Thanks!!
B002E54VSG|5|Easy to install. Nothing I can complain about.
B0012TRPGU|3|Works good but the Harley brand cleaner works better
B00NO5OSBA|5|New float needles can mean the difference between &#34;eff this bike, I'm selling it&#34; to &#34;holy crap it runs!&#34; As long as you clean and/or polish your needle valve seats and have a new set of needles the carburetor will function well. But these needles were great and i'm glad i grabbed them from Outlaw Racing.
B00V7UUQYW|4|I just received this light bar yesterday.  I received this light bar at a discount for an honest review.  Upon opening the box and removing the light bar, I found the light bar to have some good weight to it.  It is a little heavy but that seems to equate to a solid construction.  This light bar appears to be well made with rubber seals around all opening to help with waterproofing.  I have not mounted this thing to my truck yet but I hooked it up to my battery to see how bright this thing actually is, and wow!  This thing will blind you!  Super bright.  The combination of spot LEDs and flood LEDs seems to be just right.  It gives you a great focus directly in front of the bar and then gives you plenty of light off to the sides.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the mounting brackets.  They seem to be cheap and upon inspection, I would be surprised if they hold up for very long.  After I mount it to my truck with the included brackets, I will update my review.  The light bar only comes with a few feet of wire so you will need to have some extra in order to mount and wire this thing to your liking.  It also doesn't come with any sort of instructions, but this isn't rocket science.  Overall, I think this light bar will be a great addition to my truck and with a retail of just a little over $100, you can't go wrong.
B002UCAGPU|4|Fits well for what I was using it for.  The material was very breathable. Did have to adjust around the eyes and to keep my hair in it becouse I have long hair but still a ago of product.
B00AOCUV4E|5|Fit was good and this radiator really works.
B006Z907TY|5|Worked just as described.  Made life a lot easier on a plane.
B000C59XME|5|No complaints. These work as advertised. The Moog 'problem solver' line of parts is good stuff.
B003IS3HV0|5|Great product.  Worked better on my boots than anything I've used in 20 years.
B0009IQZFM|5|Excellent towel, just 1 swipe of the towel around the car removes pretty much all the water with very minimal wringing
B0006VORDY|5|I love this 2-burner grill. I had a Coleman 2-burner table top that died after many years of use. I wanted something bigger so I could put a couple pans at a time on it, and this was my answer. It is very sturdy, and cooks evenly. I just wish it came with a carrying case instead of having to buy one separately. I recommend this if you need a 2-burner grill.<br /><br />4/23/2016  I love this so much, I just bought a second one for my father-in-law.....Awesome!!
B00G6RMY82|4|Just put them on yesterday 8/3/15 look great no vibration  easy installation about 1.5hrs to do both
B00OGNVMOA|4|Smaller then expected, but very nice. The keychain is nice and solid. Sadly my was taken after I had it for only three days. So other people like it as well!
B002WD3LFY|3|It does not fit an Illinois license plate. It is maybe a couple of millimeters shorter than it should, but it doesn't matter, the edges won't fit inside the frame. Unless you bend the edges of your license plate, it won't fit. I'm using it anyway. Frame looks good.
B00T6JG58C|5|Great handlebars - solid build quality.  I installed these on my Triumph Scrambler and they look great - right in line with the character of the bike.  The bike also handles better, and the bars have a more comfortable hand position than the stock bars.
B0062AO8UA|5|Good looking heavy-duty chrome-plated license plate frame. I have had two on my truck for 18 years and they have held up extremely well. My only criticism is the blue and gold paint fades a bit with time. They use to sell these in the Navy Exchange, but no longer. I know where to get my next ones: Amazon.com. Highly recommended!
B00IWO4K8O|1|Will not fit my 1992 Toyota Pickup, Fits 95% is bull
B000TQ6P40|4|Worked exactly as advertised. Easy to use, size makes it easy to get to hard to reach lines. I do with they were  different color. They disappear easily when dropped, and hide (Blend in) whether stored in my box or hanging on the wall.
B009TF26S6|5|Motion pro or nothing at all looks great fit great I love it is buy again!!
B00XDI48GS|3|Yes they look good but about 3 of the LED lights that are right under the big light, dont work anymore
B00K9BD4IK|5|I used these to replace the flags on my mailbox. For those who realized that flags should face forward, they are a great set and responsibly priced.
B00CMOBTU2|5|Did exactly what I needed it to do, Perfect
B006B266FO|1|Does not fit my 2003 honda retro,,, too long,,,why should i pay for return shipping,,,When the product is not for my bike , when the website says it is?
B008UX68OQ|5|Fast shipping, and fits good
B0049EOVCG|5|My LR door lock works again! Thanks Mopar!
B00CNEQYF6|5|Super strong supports at an amazing price. Took 2 minutes to swap out both sides. Good feeling not having to worry about a heavy hood falling on your head.
B00CI7BMPA|5|Looks nice.
B000BM3B3A|5|Works as expected.  The packaging is a little big for such as a small can but I guess it keeps things safe.
B00M78820I|5|The shade was great - very compact when closed and effective when open. Super light - carrying case is a nice touch. It easily fits in the side door compartment when not in use.
B0000AY69V|5|Great wipe: use it like a chamois.
B00SBZRKEU|4|Quality: Good to excellent PROs: save your back while trying to fueling up awkwardly designed gas tanks on lawn mowers, snow blowers and other small engines. Filled quickly and with no mess. CONs: Discharge hose is small in length~ 24&#34;. User will have to stage tank close enough to reach refueling point, without kinking hose, which may involve  lifting the source tank...which defeats the intent of product. Still, its a good solution for push lawn mowers, etc.
B000IYNVN6|5|Quick and easy
B00JXOKB08|5|Works and fits like OEM.
B00BM8BISC|1|Don't hold a charge. .
B000S2SSYK|5|These plug wires were a great replacement for my 2000 Chevy S10 4.3. I noticed a change in the way my engine idles and runs at rpm, The original plug wires gave a great life of service after 100K.
B007Z8VG30|5|As expected
B00A4ABF8W|3|Everything was fine but the quality of the velcro behind the buffer wasn't good so it just fell off after the first application. The whole package works pretty well otherwise.
B00KTI8UBE|5|Way cheaper than local prices and took 2 minutes to program both  remotes.
B00QOO1PV4|5|Very nice product !
B000C16XJO|5|Great fit, easy install and fast service,delivery
B000C0WJUW|5|Finally, I got the perfect fit and my fan belt issue has been resolved.
B0084XOWX6|1|I RECEIVED MATTER MATERIAL WHICH IT DOES NOT STATE ANYWHERE ON THE ITEM DESCRIPTION THAT THIS IS MATTE FINISH. VERY UNHAPPY
B00Z2NIMXC|5|Looks great have only had it on my truck for a couple days but so far so good
B00RVZ7JSI|5|Good quality tool. Makes vacuum bleed as snap.
B005CLMRCG|5|It was very easy to put in with a speedy delivery
B004JQD1RU|5|Excellent fit good quality...
B009VOQ05U|1|Though it says this fits all trucks within the physical dimensions, the hole patterns do not match F150 trucks and, furthermore, mounting this to any truck that has a 2 walled truck bed (most trucks) , requires drilling new holes on the very edge of the mount and truck rails.  Also, within a week rust was already very evident in several places.  Would not recommend in any area near the coast.
B000COTX9S|5|Good
B00FS685RG|5|Received item a day early. Great product
B0060A7XMM|5|JUST WHAT I NEEDED
B000FPZV4K|5|Great product
B000E3GGDI|5|The cherries floor mats are perfect in every way. Very sturdy!
B00736FLY4|5|Great
B00OH26XRG|3|Nice plate but I wish the emblem could have been bigger.
B005HEJOWO|5|Great gear! Bags are outstanding! I would have liked to see the side straps , that go on the side of the bags , a little bit longer. I will strongly recommend these bags!
B0055AW0N0|2|Does not fit with bucket seats but good with my bench seat. Holder needs to be a little deeper.
B00E9HWS9G|3|Doesn't quite fit right. the lines for cutting to fit aren't where they should be for a good fit.
B00EFDYGDK|3|It provide support but no instructions to see if tension can be adjusted.  Cannot open or close my liftgate without assisting the door by hand.
B00NI4XVO2|5|Very nice
B002EZZ8YM|5|Product arrived as stated.<br />It arrived in great condition<br />Great Mickey hand waving decor !!!!
B00VAPOL36|5|Very good
B00ENALR14|5|Thanks
B00F3J2FW4|5|Great item fit was right on and the showed up a day early.
B00IOBSXQ0|5|I watched a youtube video with ChrisFix. I have to say it works better than any other tire conditioner. The price was good on Amazon as long as I spent $35 for free shipping. I needed other stuff anyway. This Jet Black product is not easy to mess with but it works better than the easy stuff. Washing it with a cleaner that really does a good job is important. Once you do that, with tires that are not hot from the sun, you squeeze out the tire black on the applicator and put it on the tire. Not easy but not hard either. It can be messy so go easy on the Jet Black. After 2-weeks it is still looking good on my 5-year old tires. My wife's 1-year old tires look brand new and the good part, after2-weeks they still look slick and black.
B00LU39PTI|5|I've tried all kinds of different glues for all kinds of different surfaces... wood glue, super glue, etc.  This particular adhesive is currently my first &#34;go to&#34; glue.  It works very well on just about any surface type.  I even purchased a couple of tubes for my son and daughter's family use.  I highly recommend it.
B00651CLCS|5|Product as described...., fast shipping!
B00BFDH6GW|5|It's original equipment so it worked perfectly. The shifter looks news.
B007Y85BT6|5|Works very well great buy
B009UKUUWE|4|Unfortunately I had to return it. Every other 20 attempts to start the machine it didn't start. Knowing you have to stop it and apply wax, polish or any other substance requires to constantly to stop it and start it. At the regular price I refuse to keep it. I was hoping for a better balance machine as well. I didn't see it either. I didn't see where all the hype about this machine is.
B002ZTGX3W|5|Muy bien
B000182EUK|1|I ordered the wrong one for my vehicle.
B0050NOL4I|5|Perfect for our truck.
B00Q58VR62|5|Great product from a great company!
B00E9QTCTQ|5|Love these socks! Plan on getting a couple more pair - fit perfectly and the exact thickness needed.
B00XZ9NOLU|5|Received in good condition and remote fit perfectly
B00J002WQQ|1|did not work properly keep screwing off, guess you get what you paid for.
B001GG4CQU|5|Love it
B0087NB5TW|5|Worked perfectly!!  I needed to connect the Harley headset plug into my Chatterbox audio input so that I could listen to my music and GPS guidance from the Harley while being able to communicate on the Chatterbox.  This fit the bill perfectly!!  The cord would be a little short if you were trying to connect to your helmet, but I have my Chatterbox mounted to the handlebars, so it worked well.  Short enough so it doesn't hang down and mess with the paint on the tank, but coiled so that it will give with turning, etc.
B005JU5W54|4|Good
B000C6OJP4|5|Good!
B000WJB14I|5|I use this tool constantly. It is well built and packs a great number of tools for the size. I never ride without it.
B0010E00T6|5|Good!
B000OCBO1S|4|Works great
B00FSIN0U6|3|NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH
B006LN85W0|3|Its showed up damaged and scratched up. Almost like it had been used.
B00HUXO22M|5|This paint matched as perfectly as possible for a 14-year-old vehicle. Had I spent more time sanding and feathering, it could have been even better. I wanted to cover a few rust spots, but not repaint whole sections. And I didn't have a whole day to do it. I hand-sanded rusted spots lightly, and painted over...all within 30 minutes. Let it dry overnight and then hit it with clearcoat the next day...35-40 minutes top for the whole process! This was the perfect solution and improved the appearance of our Odyssey 10-fold. Can't recommend it high enough.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Worked perfect after programing.
B00TR67FBU|5|Good
B00JALC04Y|4|awesome light! very bright and keeps you &#34;overriding&#34; your headlight. The reason for the 4 stars? The 8k bulbs put out a 10k color. If i were to order again, i would order 6k to get 8k color. Came with everything i needed to install and outside of having to lengthen my positive cable it was plug and play. It took longer to take the fairings off my bike than it did to hook up the light.
B002A8K1W2|4|It worked great

B00OABU3CA|1|This was nice but I wanted the seat and they could only give me the back, so I had to send it back.
B0001MQ7EK|5|Kept our drinks and food cool. We had a Koolatron cooler for 18 years. It finally gave up. Our new one holds twice the old one did. Took it to Las Vegas. It was 105. Used it only in the room. Kept our drinks and food cool. Again, it hold a lot. Does make a little noise, but with the A/C on did not matter
B00JZI7GHS|5|Love these earplugs and cleaning solution. Use when riding motorcycle. They work great.
B004A6JA2O|5|Good replacement cabin air filter for my 2014 Camry

B0013T7OL0|5|I bought this product for my son's birthday in July for his comfort during periods of extended driving.  He has been delightfully pleased with this cushion since he started using it.
B005BNP7UO|5|iam a ford fan, really like it and it fit rite in , looks great
B00BFU8H0Y|3|Did not fit snugly in like the old switch.  I had to glue it in.

B004L06X60|5|Used for backup lights on an f350.  Not the most rugged, but serves it's point.
B000CO89XE|5|Easy to install and shipping was quick.
B002XLHUQG|5|For the last 15 years, we have just been using plastic wheel chocks.  I saw others using these, and I didn't see the point.  Well, we bought the X-Chock Wheel Stabilizers, and I am wondering what took us so long.  The biggest change that we both noticed was that there is no more movement inside our 30' trailer when we are camped!  If you have been putting off buying these, wait no longer....they are worth every penny!
B0016IT4HA|5|excelente
B00JWSMYMI|5|Shipped Quickly and mirror fits perfectly for my 2007 Scion tC .<br /><br />I didn't use the adhesive that came with the mirror since I had my own so I can't comment on the quality of that.
B00OTISIVC|3|Someone needs to get a new ruler. It is only about 1/4 size listed.<br />Brand DROK<br />Item Weight 0.3 ounces<br />Product Dimensions 4.3 x 2.6 x 1.3 inches<br />Manufacturer Part Number 100287
B00OAW0Q1M|5|This is a great light for under dash work
B00XR2TCX4|5|Very happy with my part
B001Y93LMA|5|Well, they fit!
B00INYAMVW|5|Perfect fit!
B00514BR6G|5|Perfect replacement for your stock Harley floorboards.
B00KWLMXCK|2|Did not fit seats that are shown in picture. Cute fabric but cheaply made. You pay for what you get.
B00ANQ572C|5|ty
B002PQQ86M|5|Perfect fit
B00A4542H8|5|Thanks
B00JRFNM72|2|Half of the clips were unusable.
B0032H6V6U|2|The only issue , a big issue is that the locking mechanism il unlocks on its own at highway speeds. The issue is very annoying. I am working on changing the amount of tension on the front end.
B000SBCHCA|5|High Quality OBD II extension, you get what you pay for in some products and this one is quality made !!
B0015RTNI2|5|work great on a frontier
B007TN6GH2|5|this was a great heip
B00M0EJKOG|5|Super cute, easy application, and fits perfectly for my Jeep Compass! love it! I've had this item for five months now and it is still in perfect condition. I've gotten many compliments on it and it makes my car so much more chic!!
B0031747DA|5|Infinately adjustable
B00E1ZLDQ0|5|Great jacket, well built. Breaths really well also, keeping cool in Georgia is not easy while riding safe but this jacket fits the bill!
B00R4PUZKO|5|Thanks  item just as described
B00KTHV10C|5|Excellent product kept me from having to reprogram and replace a good key core.
B000C2WI7O|5|Fits perfectly and runs quietly.

B00R8HBD86|5|Just the right size!
B002HEOMF6|4|Excellent
B007AOQQ52|4|Fit and works good
B008ESJFU6|5|Perfect fit. I was very happy with the product.
B00NRVB846|3|The HID's are awesome they are bright and work well. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because the mating connectors to the cars light will not sit all the way and make a bad contacts. I had to use  tie wraps to prevent it from disconnecting whenever I go over a bump.
B00KN0UOEE|5|this stuff is good I use it on my yaks and truck pricey but the best stuff I have found
B006CUFN7W|5|These are far better than Hawk's cheaper track pads.  They don't require break-in and can handle wheel to wheel racing without ducting, but just barely.  Some of the hawk track pads such as the HP+ have terrible green fade, corrosive dust and squeal at low temps.  These are comparable to the PFC08 but seam to be able to withstand a little higher temps.  I would probably still recommend PFCs, but I like the hawk contingencies better.
B00IKSJV36|5|Fit great. Great price. No complaints.
B00MV5IPDQ|5|my husband loved this tag
B00594OIWS|5|Great quality. Very detailed and has rubber o-ring to seal the deal. Looks a bit big on smaller wheels on older cars but still a superb product. Super fast shipping too.
B0043063JU|5|great product and fast shipping
B00JVHLS3G|1|Product is of poor quality. Within 2 weeks the sticker portion blew off of the car and I'm left with a plastich chrome circle on my hood. Will not repurchase this item.
B001C9AX2I|5|Good price.<br />Nice stout looking product.<br />Fast delivery
B00SYFRGIM|1|this did not fit my 2005 LS6. It did not come with the 3/8&#34; adapter for the fuel line connection. It only came with the 5/16&#34; fitting. All the fitting are 3/8&#34; tapered piped thread and not the typical O-ring straight thread connections. I should have known...you get what you pay for.
B00QYBSPCE|3|do not know how to set it up one started to fade
B00CLXDCP4|1|I ordered the alternator great price. Didn't work got stranded. very disappointed. they did offer to refund the money back. They said they have had lots of problems with these alternators.
B007LIBO7W|5|I love this. it is soft, fits well, no burned fingers for me.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Supet bright !! It's solid and mounts really well. Great light for the price !!
B00CC4K868|5|These are quality leather. Look great and cut cleanly. I had previously bought Hot Leathers brand of tassels and they were terrible. The tassels were all uneven and cut badly, even had some broken halfway down. Get these tassels instead!
B00KRIJ3M6|4|Fit perfect, easy to install with no drilling, cutting or trimming.
B00AF67MSC|2|Product came with little to no real installation instruction. Also, very easy to burn out box if not intalled correctly. Lights were nice and bright but fail after an day.
B00LW1L82U|2|I have used this product before and I see while I stopped using it too many streaks, water spot on the windows, giving  it away.
B004RCZB38|1|I paid for a new bucket, but received a used one. In addition to finding a small dead bug in the bucket (see attached picture), the interior lining was quite worn and the metal brackets used to support the bucket show either signs of corrosion or residue from prior use. I typically have been very satisfied with Amazon in the past, but this is a huge disapointment. Unfortunately my car desperately needs a wash and I can't wait for another bucket to be delivered, so I'll wash out what I received and hope it lasts longer than I suspect it will based on the wear.
B004I8HKEE|5|This was the most fabulous addition to my rainbow-chrome-wrapped WRX!!! Especially since I just came out.  I love giving hot strapping  dudes rides with this new shark fin spoiler.  I can't say enough good things about it.  My partner says it adds at least 15 horsepower and I think it does too.  I'm noticeably faster and the coolest part is there's like 20 little shark cocks hanging off my roof!!! TOTES MA GOATS!!!!! OMFG
B003M2IDB6|5|Sounds real good wish it was a little louder at idle was banged up a little bit but all mufflers come that way
B00IKJ7ZS8|5|Great price for a good product!!!
B00T626ZP2|5|I have a 2004 Ford F350.  The truck was shiny but it had dull lights all over. I was contemplating polishing or chemically treating to get that new car look. Save the hard work and buy these. At less than $30 these markers look like OEM and have the same ridges inside the factory lens.  Easy to replace with a Philips screwdriver. Reuse the foam seating from the old lights and make sure the front clip is secured first before screwing down lens. The LED lights are a bonus as they should last the life of the truck. I guess LED bulbs have a polarity as I had to reverse some of them in the old bulb slot to get a light. Use dielectric grease so you never have to worry about moisture or corrosion at the bulb wire contacts.
B004IARFGA|5|This is the cold air intake deal.  Many others are twice the price, but with no more and perhaps less performance.  The factory airbox flows enough air just fine.  I wanted to get rid of the factory air tube with all of its weird channels.  I am very happy.
B00JBWWRH2|5|Great quality, simple to put on my vehicle. The vinyl seems like it will last a long time. Very pleased with my purchase and the price was great.
B000N3DDI0|5|Does what it supposed to do.
B00CGGXRK6|2|Would rate higher if it fit my truck bed. If you put it to front of the bed , it don't reach the tailgate. it is about 1 1/2 inches to short. TruXport  will not return your calls, or they say they will get back to you and never do. Now the stitching is coming apart and still waiting on reply,,,,, Installed on a 2009 dodge ram Quad cab, Tonneau cover purchased in 2009
B00DSGIP3C|3|Quality wrenches, HOWEVER, One is 41MM and the other is 46MM!!!  I was able to use the 41MM on my Honda TRX300 4X4.  I would give the wrenches 5 STARS had somewhere in the description said they are different sized!!
B002OUVL6G|5|I have used the 50amp on my motor coach for almost 3 years.  On my last 3 month trip out west (32 camp grounds) it saved my electrical system twice and picked up and corrected reverse polarity issue once.  Long story short, it way paid for itself!  LCD readout is small but says what is needed to understand alls well or what the issue is!
B00KQXKG46|5|Great, I mounted these LED's to the ATV, plus the light kit for two sets of 20&#34;LED lights, prefect, for the price, you can not go wrong, I have a hurd of cows,now I can find them AT NIGHT, these LED's lights up everything in front of you, and don't forget the cyotes chasing the cows around, these LED's lights-up those little B's TOO, happy shooting fellow farmers.
B00Y3H0M0E|5|these are great and hold my ATV down by the wheels and take the compression off of the shocks.  easy to learn how to use and once you do they go on like candy
B000CAU29W|5|I trust Baldwin.  It fit great and was easy to install.
B00595HLA8|5|These are nice, I've order twice, because apparently I am not the only one that like them.  Yes some one stole all four and replace with some cheap regular ones.  I think the tire place did it when I went to buy new tires, can't prove it, but it amazing that all four was sto,e and all four was replaced with the same tire stem.  So bottom line, WE like them a lot (lol).  Make my tires look even nicer on my Benz.
B0031G8GME|5|is the best
B001OYRGJ4|5|I've had this sticker on my vehicle a year now and it looks just as good now as it did the day it came in the mail.  Excellent quality!!!!!!
B008OWZ6LO|5|I recieved mine today, it came with the rod and both bushings. It's a simple installation on my ram 3500 automatic transmission. I read the reviews and wasn't sure about the tension bolt that everyone was talking about, it's just a common bolt so don't be concerned, you can get one at any hardware store.
B003YNATO2|5|fast shipping,  great drill definatly would buy again.. reasonable
B00U8695HK|1|This is not an air purifier. I took it apart, after it broke which only took a day, to find out its just a light with a tiny fan inside which barely moves any air.
B000UHD74E|5|This product is fantastic! It works nearly immediately and if the instructions on the can are followed it will last for a long time. Has a strong perfume smell for a few says that goes away but still keeps the vents clean. This product is primarily designed for older cars without AC cabin air filters (2001 and older mostly) to remove mildew and musty smells. If you have a cabin air filter you should first try replacing that to solve the smell! If not then run this product through the car without the air filter in for a few days then replace the filter again. Running this product with a filter will just waste it really.
B000OR18BE|5|Perfect for big campers and RVs with multiple tanks!
B000CKRWL8|5|This is a great product, but unfortunately didn't work for me.  The bike rack that I intended to use it on didn't have a 5/8&#34; hole (was slightly smaller) and therefore didn't work.  If it did, I would have kept and used it.
B001F1U5D0|5|fine.<br /><br />Extension cord is required.
B00K1L047C|5|Fit nice look nice
B006YC8XP2|5|great OE part for half the price of OEM BMW part
B000IYHEP2|5|fit perfect for my ford f-350  2002 ac conector
B003OKQ584|5|sadly, this was stolen from my doorstep a few months after I bought it.
B000BZ545U|5|these fit perfect on my ford f-350 2002 rear outer race and bearing set
B0049Y4Q9Y|4|Not sure if it is the pads, or the rotors, but they do make noise at low speed when you release the brake pedal. Not major, just a bit annoying.<br />But they do stop great, so even trade off unless 100% silent is the goal.
B012I9UWSA|5|Very easy to fold and store it on the side of the door. Very Convenient.
B00V948H74|5|This extractor is great, i used it to change my Transmission fluid worked very well did not have to drop the oil pan.at least not until i am ready to change the filter.
B00ZS9S1LS|1|Very cheap.. small, almost half size of other stickers same style. Very disappointed. Not worth money I paid.
B00JB5PAE6|5|Appears to be genuine mobis equipment. Perfect direct replacement fit on my 2010 genesis coupe. Nice touch on the older model genesis. These are a &#34;must have&#34;. Shipping was superb, faster than stuff that comes from cali.
B007TG7HVS|5|crystal clear view for about a little over a year great blades
B00QAMKNYK|5|Nice Set Good Quality And Fast Shipping!
B008I7R5EG|5|Exactly as described. Great shipping
B00LBOK8JW|5|I bought this light For my buddy can see what he doing in dark. It like day light.
B00267PZUK|5|worked perfect. Truck is up & running without removing the cyl. heads.
B0009I2OM0|5|ordered this on a gamble that it would also fit my Tacoma since it fits a highlander which has a similar chassis. Gamble was correct and it connected up and works perfectly. Cable length was about 4 inches longer than the OEM factory installed kit, but nothing a few extra zip ties couldn't handle
B00KTHZR7K|5|these work great for 2008 dodge grand caravan ease to program
B00HNQJH5S|5|Highly recommend this purchase. Very well workmanship and durability on this gauge.
B0023VKWLG|5|looks really good just like the original
B00D1CQVIY|5|Good for the price
B00MGXUGKS|5|Tool quality is much better than expected. Highly recomended
B005HTBUW6|5|Thank you
B005UHB6OM|5|Awesome pump...perfect for my 5.9 ISB in my motorhome.  Easy install.  Comes with everything you need with clear instruction.
B00J3FMHN6|5|product is Ok
B00BDEOGA2|4|Works well on several hoses. Can flush water through it even with the cap on. Only gave it 4 stars due to the piece that goes on the hose to prevent you from losing it becomes caught in the process of taking the cap off everytime.
B009DHOAFC|3|Purchased for a 1974 CB750.<br />Everything fits just fine, but these a definitely not OEM.<br />Don't use these gaskets. They are just punched out of rubber. They may fit for a while, but they deform and stretch, and you will only have problems. Get the gaskets that have the fabric layer sandwiched in the middle.<br />The metal parts look to be in spec, and I am using about half of them. No problems that I know of so far.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great pressure gauge!  Perfect for vehicle tires.  I like that it holds the pressure reading so I can check it away from the tire.  The swivel chuck is great.  The graduations are exactly what I was looking for.  It's a little on the expensive side, but it's definitely worth it if you like precision items that are made of high quality materials.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Like that it comes in 3pk for the price. Easy to put in and take off.
B00HRSQ7O6|5|fit perfectly, was delivered fast
B00FPDV3WG|4|It was great while it lasted, alarm is decently loud and will certainly get attention towards whatever is happening to your bike. Unfortunately it's not very waterproof as I learned. The bike was parked outside during a rain storm and the alarm barely sounds, sounds more like it's dying. The lock works of course but i really needed it for the audible alarm.
B00J5ZT7Z0|5|Worked...
B002X6VXL4|3|Great to have except that compressor quit after a couple of uses!
B000U0Z2L2|5|Great product and extraordinary service!This is neat,small and compact and works well.I use it in my 18 wheeler Volvo 670 to charge fans,laptop,cellphones,headset and more.The first unit I got only worked one time then died (Found out later it was the fuse)One email to seller and they decided to promptly send me a.new one without me having to return the first one.Im very happy will by again.Great product,has a neat blue lighting.
B00I6JTKSA|3|Received my bulbs the other day.  They came 4 to a pack.  I received 4 of the same bulb, unlike the description that states there is 1 for the dome and 1 for the cargo area.  Be aware, they do not fit the cargo area light, that's a different type of bulb.  It was also a very tight fit for the dome.  Almost felt like i was going to break the dome light-bulb holders placing the LED bulb in there.
B002OL9YUA|5|Very cute key chain. Arrived as advertised and on time.
B001PKCK34|2|Great hitch, but I have to rate it poorly due to damage caused by extremely inadequate packaging.  The hitch was shipped in a thin cardboard box with some brown paper wadded up with it and the one thin bit of clear tape on the box seam predictably snapped at the corner.  It's laughable because that little bit of paper will obviously do nothing to protect the hitch from its journey through the UPS system.  Sure enough, as others have reported, there were tears in the box from the hitch jostling around, resulting in scars on my brand new hitch and one of the labels rubbed into oblivion.  Some of the scars were on the visible part of the receiver tube.  Every one of those scratches is a place for rust to form.  What's worse is the fact that after I wrangled the thing into position under the car and got the bolts in on one side, I then discovered that the flange on the other side was so badly bent that only one of the bolt holes on that side lined up.  After trying in vain to pound the flange back into alignment underneath the car with a board and a hammer, getting my muffler heat shield all bent up in the process, I finally gave up and took the dang thing off again so that I could give it a proper beating in the driveway.  All that time and energy wasted.  If Amazon or the seller will refund me half my purchase amount to compensate me for the extra hour of time and sweat in my driveway to fix what should have been prevented by proper packaging, then I will upgrade my rating to five stars.  The thing looks great under my 2006 XC90 and the installation was easy enough after watching videos online and reading other reviewer's tips.  My own tip is this:  Before you attempt to install the hitch, measure the distance between all the bolt holes from one side to the other.  If they don't all measure within 1/8&#34; of each other, then look to figure out which flange is bent and fix that first.  Be sure to use spare lumber to protect the hitch while you're pounding it.  A hand-held sledge hammer would be helpful, but I did it OK with a regular hammer after several mighty blows to a board against the flange with the hitch pushed up against the brick wall (with another board for protection) while the kids held the thing stable for me.  My other tip is that one of those square plastic bins that pet food or cat litter comes in is just right to to help hold up the hitch while you are installing.  The spare tire is a bit restricted by the hitch now and wouldn't quite winch all the way up, but it's up far enough.
B006TN2YZG|5|Excellent fit and finish. These replaced my OEM cracked into pieces handles. East to change out with only a phillips screwdriver and needle nose pliers.
B001KQ3NFC|5|Fits and works well. Good way to save quite a bit of money compared to dealer pricing.
B000COA1K8|4|Needed to cut more sheetmetal in the rear than I was honestly comfortable with, but got the job done and these things are beefy. If the previous owner of my XJ hadn't already trimmed sheetmetal, I wouldn't have bought these but I couldn't use stock flares so I was stuck. Gotta have coverage over the tires to be legal here. Live & learn...
B00OXWZ0W4|4|was what i expected and works great<br />got my trouble light to go out
B0013GHAV2|2|did not stretch around wheel very well. material too stiff
B005SRAYTM|4|Good cover for just being made for a generic fit.
B00VTTHQ9Y|5|This polish was amazing! It was SO easy to apply and required a lot less effort to achieve a perfect mirror finish than other brands. There was no leftover residue or &#34;missed spots&#34;  The microfiber cloths that came in the kit worked well - I used one to apply and one to buff.
B001KSE0Y8|5|Fits very well. I can't say it's a &#34;perfect&#34; fit since I did not measure but you'd be hard pressed to tell the mirror is a replacement just by looking. Great price vs OEM. Adheres securely. Will gladly order again if the need arises - let's hope it doesn't.
B000EQR87S|5|Perfect replacement. No more check engine light. Very happy
B005XBGSAC|5|Despite other reviews, I really like these gloves/mittens.  The ones I received were well made and fit perfectly.
B00ARJNXYE|5|Works great
B00CASDZKC|5|Perfect mats for our '09 Toyota Highlander.  Previously we had towels hanging over the seats.  These look so much better & will be so easy to clean.
B007WUQUU0|4|It did the job just fine, but the keys are pretty flimsy. Be careful not to bend them.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Compact and unfolds to a large mat. Enough for 2 adults. Solid purchase.
B004XAC15K|5|nice small wipes for your car
B00EWFEIQ6|4|Sticker looks great, went on smoothly on the car.  I was a bit worried about that, because the sticker came in a fairly flimsy envelope that had been through the ringer.  It was extremely wrinkled, and as a result, the sticker was too.  Thankfully I was able to smooth it as I applied it.  Perhaps the seller should choose a slightly more rugged envelope in the future!
B0052XTSS0|5|These were a perfect fit for our 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe. We are very pleased with them!
B00REJX5BQ|4|I like but the latching system is not the greatest one is already messed up
B00K0UDEWQ|5|Excellent product
B001AV4CNO|5|Affordable, as advertised and shipped quickly.  Great!
B00BQE5HUW|1|THEY ARE NOT BRIGHT ENEOUGH BUT WORKS.,
B008AM1BRQ|3|What you see is what you get. Make sure you're aware of the dimensions when ordering. Some think it's bigger than it is.
B00ONACJO8|2|Not what I was expecting
B0015S8ZNK|5|No shimmy and shake with these....they stop you real well.
B001NZV0BE|5|Very good
B00ELASYIA|4|Heavy duty and long enough to reach a car parked behind my truck.
B00BFLW75O|5|Great battery, great price
B00R8MR4XO|5|Buena
B001MU29LA|5|I just replaced my OEM stock denso spark plugs with these on my 2007 4runner. Only been a couple of days but running smooth so far.
B00496XHGK|5|Good
B00469L0OQ|5|GREAT!!!!!!!
B00AC6XRPM|5|Awesome, awesome soft luggage for my KLR.  Paired them with the Happy Trails SU racks, and they work great.  They just swallow everything.  Huge capacity and they strap down tight.  Get up at your campsite, open these guys up and start tossing stuff in.  Strap down, and you're back on the road in minutes.  When I wanted to leave my bike for a few days, it took about 60 seconds to take them off my bike and throw the bags in a car.  Easy good solution for soft luggage.  Sure, you COULD spend over $1000 for luggage, but I'm very happy with these so far.<br /><br />For the KLR, you really should have rear luggage racks for these, otherwise they one on the right side would be too close to the exhaust.  Also, the straps are designed for securing the bags to steel tube racks.
B000CF8W1W|5|Arrived on-time and on Quality.
B00GD8I9IS|4|So far so good, easy to install.
B007EF7E62|5|easy to install (10 minute jobmb) and now my car doesn't leak coolant.
B00M0VY2JC|5|Higher quality than I expected. So far so good on the coating. Looks good even after a few installs.
B00IMPEWHM|5|2003 Silverado<br />fit perfectly
B0009IQZPW|5|it works wonder on my new cars. I will not need to worry about fine scratches from using this soft foam.
B007HRQD1Y|5|Pump works great as replacement for my golf cart cooler
B00ED5EZEK|5|Application a little tricky to figure out but excellent when applied
B00KB9FCEY|5|I got sick of everyone putting trash in my recycle can this not only stops them but gives them a good laugh
B00RJUZY9Q|5|Works as expected.  I am very happy with my purchase.
B00M4L4ZVS|2|Settled to much , dries too fast . Had to put 2 extra coats
B00X6G8BQ0|5|Awesome lock
B0007OWD2M|4|Works well! I like the foam spray rather than a drippy windex type spray. Also definitely recommend using news paper for cleaning- it worked best for me.
B00O64AK9M|5|Deafening!  Don't mess with my daughter now :o)
B001N2O3PM|4|Nice quality, looks good on my car
B006X27RF0|1|Windshield arrived on time and didn't fit my motorcycle. I returned it for a full refund.
B009B4CJJQ|4|Worked great and fit just fine.
B00407WNE0|4|I was a little skeptical after reading the reviews stating this may not be a real Mopar product.  The install and fitment was awesome.  Looks Great!
B00B7PO7LU|5|Not bad
B00LM4OQMG|5|Love it! Easy to install fits great...looks good. Holds glass well.
B00F6GKKQC|4|Happy so far.
B00MYI89JA|5|Worked and fit well.
B00UB7AZ5W|5|good cover great price
B002OTZRNA|1|Stickers were labeled &#34;front&#34; & &#34;back&#34; but front sticker did NOT fully cover the Chevrolet emblem (so gold now shows as a thick outline- not pretty) and then back sticker was too much, had to cut it. Tried to see if it was a typo by switching the stickers but wouldn't fit that way either. I bought the stickers to fit my 2010 Tahoe and they don't fit! Waste of money!!
B004A6I5V6|5|Great
B0046NPOGC|5|Straight out of the package I put it in my pickup and it went right in. Most you have to jostle them in but this one fits perfect.
B00O99NVS6|5|A+
B00192QB3I|5|Good to have on hand when I need to use my 30 amp to connect 110 volt equipment.
B005VTT3JY|5|great price
B00823FSRC|5|Bought for my aunt and she loves it. She can now go kayaking by herself without having to have someone there to help with transporting the kayak. Yes the wheels smell when you open the box. Stop putting your nose on them to see if they smell and you won't have an issue. This sat in my living room for 4 days before I have it to my aunt and I didn't even notice them after initial assembly.
B00MTHH5A0|5|Bright light. Bought 2 for electra glide. Only used the light/lens in place of the factory fog lights. A little bit smaller in diameter. Had to bend in the stock light ring clamp,but For the money I don't mind.
B00155237W|4|A bit pricey, but probably worth it.  I use covers like this on my front plate.  Over time, with bumps, car washes, road debris, will usually crack and score the regular plastic covers in about 4 months.  The &#34;unbreakable&#34; cover will last me about one year.  I bought this one to replace my previous &#34;unbreakable&#34; after it cracked in an automatic car wash.
B002MFXQIE|4|We have outdoor lights where you can not change the bulb - I used these to cover the lights to help reduce flying bugs that are attracted to the white lights at night.  They adhered to the lights well and helped to reduce the flying insects
B004ME8MZ0|5|These mirrors fit like a glove. I was a bit concerned when I ordered them but they are a decent quality and fit very well. Definitely recommend this item. The price and quality is perfect.
B001EAWOE0|1|This did not work for my 2000 silverado with external CD player.  i could hear faint sound from my iphone but that was it.  Thougt it was defective adn ordered a replacement but got the same results.  The support desk was not helpful at all.  Could not get anyone on the phone to explain options for making it work.  I did finally get the device returned and refunded.
B00WZA0U1M|5|Works great but if you don't put the bearing on exactly correct it will make you front brakes lock up when your driving no matter what speed your doing be very careful. Once correct it perfect
B00MWCROVW|4|The item is pretty generic,  but wanted a certain brand name (Motorcraft)<br />Use this product in several cars I own.<br />Found  best price & ordered it.<br />Received it earlier then expected.<br />Very satisfied all the way around.
B00TJ2CYUY|5|Ok
B003W0SK9S|2|The glass mirror came in a bag so some were chipped along the sides when I recieved it. I managed to use the good ones without chips.
B004BFW82I|5|Works great
B00LD1J362|5|The part number matches.  Good price, looks & works just like the $14 filter from my dealer!
B0002F68FO|5|Used in garage at back door for 2 steps. Great that it can be folded to the side if we have to bring large furniture in or out.
B000BQWLE6|1|it could not fit a soda can.
B000GVGJA8|5|Easy install, sounds nice. Good product in my book.
B00GQBFZU2|4|Good fit and good paint match-installed on 2015 escape using double backed tape. On tight.
B00VEYZU9W|5|All went well
B004W6IU32|5|Love them
B00979OE5C|5|A bit tight but feels good.
B00HUG0JB2|5|They work great!
B001O0BJUK|5|excellent product
B000RXNLK6|5|does the job
B0016ZNIAW|5|Good product
B0041WH74U|5|When I first looked at these lights in the package, I was a little worried.  When I put these on my truck I was frickin awe struck! ! These lights are flipping awesome! !!! Love them!!!!
B002G2YAVU|5|This compressor works great on my 2007 Honda Odyssey.  Has been installed for about a month now, and is working great.  Nice that it included the O-rings.<br /><br />Update: this AC compressor is still working great after one year.
B0069ANVBU|5|Was used to replace a back absorber involved in an accident.  Nothing negative to say about it.
B000RNU4BA|5|Fits perfect
B002NEUOGG|5|Worked great.
B008S8YDSG|5|2006 Saturn Vue direct fit replacement
B004TOZRMO|5|Awsome shift knob!  Well weighted to assist during those quick gear changes on the track!
B003YJLAIK|5|I hope this review helps you in your shopping. I always read them until I make a decision. This is a great product. We were having repeated problems with leaks in our RV at the sinks. We were not using a regulator. We bought this and set it at about 50 psi. and we have not had a leak since. I feel pretty dumb for not having bought it sooner. But I am very glad I have it now. I will buy the same one if I ever need another.
B00J09FKN4|1|It doesn't fit in my car
B003RQBKLC|5|Great product, it work as it was stated on the web site
B000A6VBZ2|4|Decent replacement,  fit the f-350 well.  Plastic seems thinner than oem.  But for the price it's good to go!
B00272GPTO|5|Works great tks.
B000IPAK9S|3|I hope this review helps you in your shopping. I always read them until I make a decision. I gave this 3 stars. I started to give it 4 but thought about how that would be interpreted by another buyer. So let me tell you the good. This thing is heavy duty. I was very impressed with that part of it. I have no concerns whatever about using it on my RV and running every electrical item we own. The reason for the downgrade is the poor quality of the way one of the fittings is attached at the end of the cord. The shielding insulation on the cable does not go all the way inside the fitting. So the shielding stops and there is a gap of about 1/8 -3/16 of an inch where you can see the individual wires running into the fitting. Don't get me wrong. There are no BARE wires exposed. But where the shielding stops you can see the red and black and white and green ( I think those are the colors... I do not have it in front of me) wires as they run into the fitting. It all feels secure. And I am not going to get shocked. But I suspect that that makes the over all strength of the fitting to be reduced. I think the individual wires could probably pull out easier than they would if the shielding ran all the way inside the fitting. But it was not enough to make me send it back. And we use it without worry. I may put some silicone at that end to keep moisture out.
B001GC2LVM|5|I hope this review helps you in your shopping. I always depend on them when I buy something. These may be the handiest things I have ever bought for our RV. Leveling has always been a problem. Yelling and screaming while the wife directs me. Boards...then more boards...then more boards. By the time we were level in our decrepit old Texas state parks, we weren't speaking for the first day of the trip. But these things are amazing. I get the RV almost to where we want it to be. Then we slide these under the wheels on the low side. My wife stands there with a level on the side of the RV and I back onto these levelers.  She says stop when the bubble is centered and we are done. They may have saved our marriage, and they certainly have made camping more fun.
B000TCCVR4|5|GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
B0081S997I|5|A+++++
B005Z8HAUK|5|Haven;t used it much yet, but in tests it worked quite well and as advertised. Storing it in the Jeep as a way to air up after crawling off road. I am happy with the quality and output of the pump.
B004CMMFK0|4|WISH IT WAS STRONGER LOVE IT
B00E9RV69E|5|Best fitting MTB gloves I have
B00KQ81M94|5|I like this sham. I have a black truck and don't like water spots. Works well.
B008427D88|5|I am satisfied with the whole trasaction and the product is great.
B00ICA1IX8|5|Great decal. Quick shipping.
B004P3RKEW|5|Very nice OEM part that is real heavy metal. You can't beat that for $20.00.
B00877SL2M|5|Love them!
B00JEUI40U|4|The metal is flimsy and bends very easily which is why it only got 4 stars. The look, fit, and design are perfect. The product was packed very well. I would recommend getting this professionally painted to match your jeep. I got mine painted and it looks like it is one with the hood. Better looking than any of the aftermarket hoods and after professional paint it's still under 1/3 of the cost.
B009WD48O0|5|Another great product from Kuryakyn.  Works as designed.  Easy to install with basic tools and knowledge
B00KL3ALGO|5|Great product. This is the second set of shades I've purchased and this model was far superior to suction cup variants. The slick design and functionality makes this an easy choice. Great price point too.
B007W57ZGI|5|This was a great piece to make use of current lights for additional brake lights.  Easy to install with basic tools and knowledge
B000GGURLK|5|I shortened the foot pegs, which was easy.  I did decide to use my own bolts. Wife loves then when we go riding. She has put all her weight on them and they have held up great so far.
B00I8IQD02|4|This fit my 2009 Ford Escape Hybrid with no trouble.
B002J7VX4Y|4|I am a a car guy and do my share of buying, selling, swapping.  Like most men of &#34;my nature&#34; I keep my vehicles detailed as a hobby.  I &#34;like&#34; this product, but do recommend you dilute it and use sparingly.  I say dilute as it is &#34;strong&#34; and a little goes a LONG way.<br /><br />  And even though I change cars more frequently than average, I do have a 17 year old pick-up which I have owned since it was new (actually ordered it to my specs!) and it has seen very few days when it was &#34;dirty.&#34;  I recently noticed the headliner was &#34;sticky&#34; to touch and after some thought, have concluded the Chemical Guys &#34;New Car Smell&#34; is likely the culprit.  So, using Griot's &#34;Interior Cleaner&#34; and a micro fiber I was able to get it clean, but I am now cautious when using the Chemical Guy's &#34;smell&#34; product sprayed directly onto fabric. Also, others have warned this product can &#34;spot&#34; hard plastics.<br /><br />  Taking advice from a fellow reviewer of this product, I recently sprayed a few pieces of paper towel with this product and put them beneath the seats.  This method seems to work well in &#34;freshening&#34; the interior (close the windows and let it set overnight) and I do not have to worry about &#34;sticky&#34; fabric.  And, with the paper towel (or cotton rag, or whatever) it is  simple procedure to &#34;refresh&#34; without overspray getting onto plastic (remember, this stuff may spot plastic) or windows.<br /><br />  In summary, I do like this product (but I do not &#34;love it&#34;) as it serves a purpose as long as you first dilute and use with caution.  My experience is it will accumulate and can become &#34;sticky&#34; thus attracting dirt.  And, it can spot hard plastic.  If you buy one bottle, you will have it for years as a few &#34;sprays&#34; go a long way. Good luck!
B001OBE8QQ|5|Don't listen to that last person, he cant read!!<br />This is a great product, just install it using my old pads and rotter and did a nice burnout im still waiting for my new pads and rotter that i order before this calipers but this guys are strong and as advertise, the other guy complained that this is just the caliper with no pads or rotter or mounting hardware, and yes he is right and that is because in no where in the page does it say that it comes with any of that, this is bare-bones, just the caliper and the bolts that that you may know as &#34;guide pins&#34; that are used to mount the caliper, that is why its cheap, what you see is what you get, don't expect it to come with racing break pads and a magic fairy that will change them for you either
B004U2FRZW|4|I like it
B00KWLKX18|5|Fine works great just add drop of lock tight np
B000GD5FMY|1|Great value but pretty crap products. I've been using them on my commute for two weeks but I have had debris and crap fly into my eyes multiple times already.<br /><br />Either they don't fit or it's the foam which didn't 100% surround the interior but these are making my rides dangerous....
B00EDFM66E|4|Quite good. The bulb base, type 921, needs to be modified to fit in the socket. illumination level is as expected!!!
B00HYJFWYE|5|Perfect
B0006MRR9O|5|works great
B00UXG7F7W|2|Not bad
B000MD4YKM|5|Just as described - made well and arrived on time
B002UJVNFA|2|Got what I paid for...
B00Y7BLATI|4|Patriotic.
B0016IL0GS|5|product was just as advertised. worked perfectly. thanks
B00C3094RK|4|took a little longer for shipping then it's expected but it was okay
B002OUIXKS|4|Works good
B007FU3MS0|5|[[ASIN:B007FU3MS0 HDE VAG305 OBD II Diagnostic Trouble Code Reader Scanner for Volkswagen Audi]]  I got a &#34;link error&#34; message and realized I forgot to turn the ignition key to ON position. The scanner indicated a bad transmission speed sensor which put my car in the dreaded &#34;limp mode&#34;.  I replaced the sensor myself and the transmission shifts great now.  Before I bought this scanner I paid a garage $45.00 to have a code read and erased.  I carry this scanner in the car in case of trouble on the road.  I can read the scanner and know what the problem is. The last trouble code was only a faulty glow plug which was a minor problem and a simple fix.. This has been a great time and money saver for me. I guess it doesn't  perform as well on some newer cars, according to reviews.
B000B8JUG6|5|keeps my engine cooler by raising boiling point a few degrees higher
B00ONDM4O0|5|The pictures can be a bit deceiving, rest assured it holds the camera level, and the phone holder is fully adjustable. I have a sony snapshot and hd video camera that both work just fine on it. Helps if you have the phone clamp jaws hold your phone at the bottom to not take up space in your tray. Even with an overhead cb mount, this all works just fine.
B00N4ZT5A4|4|Great product, love the way it works, wish I had thought of it.  This  is my second one,  durability is an issue, possibly using a heavier plastic and redesign the clips.  My first one lasted only 3 years.  I would recommend this product to anyone, even with a 3 year life expectancy.
B00S4RGM94|5|Work great! Covered the seams with silicone just to be safe. Been underwater and still no condensation. Excellent for fog lights, won't blind anyone if you have them adjusted properly. Overall a good product
B001MOSBRW|5|popped this replacement in-in about 10 minutes! Best car parts deal ever!
B000CO9B04|5|Worked great, Just as advertised.
B003C1TEG0|5|great for the money
B0060A9JQK|5|Worked Great!! Easy to install

B001OMVCIC|5|loved it
B000JWQL1G|5|A perfect, leak free fit. I use Gold Plug on all my cars.
B00O2FAQT4|5|Perfect fit. Thank you
B0067UD0NG|5|Perfect fit!
B008427D88|5|Fit my 2014 Honda Foreman just fine.  Good price.  Good quality.
B000EQRZBC|4|OEM what more can be said
B005M3ARMQ|1|Did not fit. Even I after I verbally spoke to the manufacture, they assured me it would work. After I received it And it did not fit. Then was told they did not make one for my year vehicle
B00Q1F8L2C|4|Great fit and a WHOLE lot cheaper than buying from the factory. Just a note if you plan on replacing this yourself. Run your truck through a carwash with an undercarriage wash to avoid getting a face full of dirt when plugging the new one in. That and safty glasses never hurt.
B00JOY6U7U|5|nice
B00ELHNEQ0|5|Always been a great oil for 40 years
B000CFHCTA|5|All new and great quality
B000COU3N8|5|nice
B00FH43VFK|4|Solid helmet for the price
B000EFOZ9S|5|Very good
B003UJCEMU|5|It works perfectly. After installed, the car pass the equired motor vehicle inspection.
B00138OMJI|5|the perfect canoe tie down
B005A2R628|5|This kit is a must have for anyone who likes to detail their vehicles, it comes with everything you need to get the job done and your car will look fantastic.
B000JWOPI2|5|Well made and leak free. Fits like OEM. I have one of these on all my vehicles. Buy it and let the service station install it at your next oil change. Even more important with the extended oil change intervals of the newer cars.
B000C81WOI|5|thank you very much for being there to serve the needs of people like me, I didn't leave home, I ordered it and you deleivered it home............love it
B00DHQ770K|5|Extremely satisfied with quality and fit. Doubt if it's possible to find another brand to compete. Decent price only because it is quality in my opinion. Thanks Intro-Tech!
B007J7PJDA|5|Adorable little sticker.  Perfect to add to my moms pink elephant collection!!
B002WPC1IK|5|Best car product on the market Thank you Amazon
B004XASFEG|2|Bought this pump to replace the cheap-looking Chinese-made pump included in Gates kit but it doesn't look much better. I assumed this would be a high-quality Japanese-made part, being from Aisin, but this is in fact made in USA to a noticeably lower standard. The pulley and shaft are identical to original Honda, right down to the NSK stamping, however the impeller is cheaper looking and the aluminum casting finish is far rougher. I'm sure this pump would work just fine, but if you are looking for actual OE quality, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Pictured: Chinese pump from Gates kit (left), Aisin WPH-800 (center), OEM Honda pump removed from vehicle (right)
B005LXMXYW|4|Got the license plate kinda took a while but did arrive before the estimate date given. The overall quality was much better than I anticipated for the price! Very happy with the purchase and would recommend to anyone. Side note: I read a lot of reviews before buying, seen people stating that the logo was a sticker, not sure what they got but it's not a sticker.
B00NOAJK1S|5|I purchase these as a replacement for my 2015 Toyota 4Runner day time running lights.  Installation was simple.  The look in the day is amazing!
B00PM35DRK|5|Excellent! The part I needed at a price I could afford.  Finally have my radio and trunk release back!
B00LGTH74G|5|good replacement.
B00BFDIKTE|5|perfect replacement part
B0042T6POA|3|didn't fit all that great - and the logo wore off in less than six month
B00LLXVD3S|4|Brighter than stock but not as bright as I expected. Came with two spare one dome n one trunk light so in total 10 bulbs.  Overall good n will see how long they last!!!
B003H6SPZG|5|OEM part can't go wrong here.
B0002Q80RW|5|works on my projects
B00AFRIP3C|5|Took longer to install but i love it so far.  Seems to have more hp as advertised...
B002XLGR1K|5|I hope this review helps you with your shopping. I always read them until I make a decision. This latch was a perfect replacement for the one my son broke. I was worried about it fitting. I did not know if they were universal. But I measured the length of the stem on the latch an took a chance. Perfect. All the holes matched my existing holes. The materials were the same. No one but me knows it is not the one that came on the RV.
B00L8WP4IW|5|Got them today for my mini cooper s 2007. They fit perfectly and had no problem putting them on.
B0038EPGC2|5|good
B00153WRKW|5|these well fit on a ford f-350 2002 inner race
B00E5OUOCQ|5|This one not only fits my 2014 528xi very well, but I just bought another one as it also fits my new m235i (although it's tight there)!  The shade has two circular loops that fit each side of the windshield, and loose reflective flaps fit over the BMW 'Connected' sensor/rearview mirror 'hump very well too, with flaps at the corners for complete windshield shading (at least for my 2 BMWs).  The extra nice part is that it collapses neatly into an included small pouch that easily fits between the drivers seat & console (or in the door pocket).  This was a good buy too -  A definite Recommend!  NOTE for 2-Seried Owners:  Wile this does fit my m235i, it is pretty tight and takes some finesse & time to install.  A much better fit for your 2-Series is the &#34;New 6 PCS Windshield Car Window Sun Shade Shield Cover Visor Foldable for BMW M3 3 Series 328i 330i 335i&#34; sold here on Amazon by JIAKANUO.  It takes a couple weeks to get here from China, but the fit is excellent - Good luck! &#34;
B00KTIYXLU|1|Terrible product very dissatisfied with this. It was my fault that I waited so long to install it and the warranty is up so I didn't even try to contact them. But I even bought new batteries and the chips / remote still does not work. I would not buy again very very dissatisfied
B006OQ35GU|5|Allows me to see what I really don't want to see.  Now I know when the water is running clear.
B0073X3R5M|5|I never thought about the antenna on our new vehicle not fitting through my older shorter garage door --the SUV easily cleared it but the slight dent on our door and rubbing noise indicated we had a problem.  After hopping in and out to assist the antenna in exits and entries, I was thrilled to discover &#34;Stubby&#34; would knock just enough off the height so as not to rub against the door.  When ordering this I knew it would make the clearance, but I was afraid it would affect the quality of the sound in the vehicle.  This was totally unfounded.  The music system plays with no static--the same as with the original antenna.  I'm thrilled not to have to screw the antenna on and off each time I leave or come home.
B0007WXJDQ|4|I replaced my electric heater with this model simply because there aren't any extra parts to replace it's very easy to start once you get it going just walk away you can't ask for more trouble free last a very long time plenty of hot water now I'm happy with it thanks
B00WTZVLQ6|1|The TS stands for 'total s***' Touchscreen is a joke.  When calling customer service about it, they suggested using a pencil with eraser or a stylus pen, seriously?  Grab a sandwich when doing uploads and downloads, it'll be awhile!  Also, the biggest and most prevalent gauge is battery volts??!!  Also, for gas engines there is only one &#34;tune&#34;, if you can call it that. Big letdown, might be worth $100.00 as a custom tunes transporter, not $400.00
B003GD4FP4|5|Just at described. Great product and good quality.
B00439WBUG|5|very useful tool. I use on my car and for disassembling computers, laptops and phones.
B000MD4YKM|5|This thing works great. It gets into all the nooks and crannies where I need it to be. It holds on really good allowing you to not have a big greasy mess.
B00RBML7RK|5|Fixed the mirrors on my 02 suburban... Took all of 2 minutes to install.<br /><br />Hint to most of you folks wondering... The switches go out before the mirrors. Push really hard on the switch and try to get the mirror to move just a little bit, if it does, the switch is trashed and you need one of these.
B007IEMNEW|5|Original Saab equipment.  Replace your old fob before it falls to pieces.  All I did was exchange the circuit boards between my old one and this new key fob and is works great.  No programming needed.  The programming is in the green circuit board you see as soon as you open up the key fobs.  This is worth the price.  It is original equipment and works like new.  Could not be happier with the purchase.  The rubber on my key is still deteriorating but that does not matter because the fob works as intended.  Do yourself a favor and buy this if you need a replacement.  IT is very easy to remove the circuit board, just two little tabs that can be pushed off of the boards with a small screw driver or pocket knife blade.
B00YZN204M|5|... and the truth is this decal is perfect and y'all's service is great. I expected my decal to come by/on Thursday but Monday morning it was waiting for me. ☺️ I just really love it and it has weirded out some grocery store carry out kids who don't get the reference so that's an added bonus.
B00UM102D2|5|Very pleased. Quality item. Fast shipping. Thanks!
B00LU5FHF2|5|As promised - will buy from this seller again
B000I04Z7Q|5|everything works great many colors modes and plays with the music killer good deal for the price
B00NQUSNIC|3|It fit. So far so good.
B001N729FS|4|Made for smaller batteries, I thought this was going to fit my group 24 diesel engine battery.
B00IXW0H3W|5|love it
B0009IQZFM|5|I got this unsure of how well it would actually work. When I used it I was amazed how much water it absorbed. I was literally able to dry the roof and hood of my car before ringing it out. Even when the towel was full of water the towel didn't drip it held the water very well. The towel is a nice size and being microfiber is of course soft and doesn't scratch. Overall a very good buy!
B00VTUUGRW|1|I purchased Ambush pipes thinking these are going to look great... and they did in the box. I've had trouble from the start, first and foremost the hardware that comes with the pipes throw it away. The bolt that bonds the pipes together is the right size problem is the poorly weilded section it goes through doesnt line up (so theres no mounting the pipes). To fix this I had to go to the hardware store and buy a 1/4-20 1.5inch bolt lock washer and a nut.<br />Next is the mounting when mounting (&#34;DON'T EVEN THINK of using torque cones because the pipes are NO WHERE even cloes to being truly round, I had to file to the point that the chrome started to peel, so I stopped  NO WAY the torque cones were going to fit.)<br /><br />Now the ungodly work of bolting the pipes to the head.  To line up the bolts loosly mount the pipes to the heads like where they are barly hanging on then you have to work to line up the poor weilds once you do &#34;use the extra hardware store parts you had to buy&#34;. and tighten them down.<br /><br /> Now they are mounted... Guess what THEY LOOK AWESOME!<br /><br />Lets fire this baby up, sound is awesome as well... This was turning out to be, OK... Took off down the street and realized these pipes get so freaking hot that they burned through my jeans and into the top of my boot... SO WRAP THEM FIRST, NO QUESTIONS ASK WRAP THEM!!!<br /><br />I get back to the garage and my helpers says whats that on the pipe? YUP the freaking chrome half way down the pipe had bubbled and popped off, wow less two miles.<br /><br />I'll say this Harvey the owner of AccessioriesHD was helpful with with istall... So with that said, Thanks Harvey.<br /><br />Overall, the pipes sound good but thats it.
B001TK7CYM|5|Good deal will probley get more
B00GUF74HQ|5|Works good. Product did not say 2014 dodge, it stopped at 2013. Called Deezee company and they said this was the right part number.
B002VVCJV4|4|First, it is TOTALLY worth the money since getting as tach and the correct housing from harley would have cost $360 and resulted in another bulbous gauge crowding the handlebars. this is a very elegant and easy solution.<br />Being able to monitor the oil temperature in real time as i ride in 95 degree heat certainly puts my mind at easy (my sporty  is my first air cooled machine). Save for battery Voltage. the gear it registers is still one gear off but i am confident i will get the calibration right after a couple of tries.<br />Very visible even in broad daylight. Easy to install. looks great when the bike is off . no complaints at all. My buddy already wants one for his sporty
B004ZF4R78|5|Make sure you get a zero mistakes pair of wiring harness adapter with (2) 8 ohm 50w on each, cheap here ($15) or you car's computer will bug you to death with error messages. OEM lights use about 70w each and these only 35w so your car thinks ur lightbulbs are burn&#34;t out.<br /><br />Otherwise plug and play.
B00G258I0G|5|This step arrived today.  It is just as described.  Very sturdy - and will work great for those times that we have a big step down from the motorhome to the ground!
B010N7RW2S|5|As a new device and fully charged:<br />1- Jump started my truck from dead battery.. the jumpstart worked perfectly!,<br />2-It charged my smart phone to 100%  with  the Anker charge showing 90% still remaining (great  result so far), but the phone  battery was not dead, I think it was  less than 20% remaining.<br />3- From about 80% charge  on the Anker charger till it died, it was only able to bring my dead  iPad 2  to 50%.  Need to know the specs of the iPad battery to help understand this case.<br />4- Product is well built. Good for Anker!<br />6-I am specially very pleased with the packaging  because I’m  an off road enthusiast, and  this package fits well with other gears.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I found  the red cable clamp broken, the plastic part looks sheep, spring and the rest looks fine. I am getting a replacement from Anker.<br /><br />Note:<br />You need to make sure that light on the jump start is Green before trying to start the engine. If it is flashing red, disconnect the cable from the charger and connect again. The green will only light when it senses that it is connected  to the car battery terminals. if I ever had a chance, may test it  with car battery completely disconnected. Look forward to similar product from Anker with more Juice and built in solar option. This is going to be very attractive for off road enthusiasts, and long distance travelers
B0073W7F9W|5|This little antenna is amazing!!  First of all, it is very high quality and extremely durable.  It does not flex at all.  I have taken it through the automatic car wash and you can leave it in place knowing that nothing will happen to it.  As far as reception goes, I can pick up some stations better now than I could with the 3 foot long &#34;flag pole&#34; of an antenna that comes on my Jeep from the factory.  This antenna probably even performs better than rear windshield mounted antennas.  I have no proof to back that up though.<br /><br />Great antenna for the money!
B006F8ZI8K|5|Work like it should would buy again
B008FYKV4I|4|Not the absolute best wiper blade that I've ever used; but definitely super good quality. Did a good job cleaning off my window; but didn't last particularly long; after a few months it wasn't doing as good of a job. So about typical to &#34;normal&#34; wiper blades.  That being said, it was better than normal cleaning when it was new.
B001PRX7WK|1|not very good no matter how tight you make it its not enought and then small allen screws strip out NOT FUN GETTING THEM OUT
B00LBIJ3Q2|5|Very light weight, but what I wanted to protect the head rests.
B0094IZ3BA|5|Very messy to use, but this stuff has made a couple of old, cranky deadbolts work almost as good as new.
B00ODEOUR8|5|I love the decal, looks great. Contacted seller to switch for iPhone 6 instead of 6+ and responded immediately. Came before delivery date.
B00WRV96G4|4|I wish the front mud flaps were bigger as I am still getting stuff splashed up onto my car.
B00K1C1WC2|4|OK for the price! Made for a larger tire than my 21&#34; diameter trailer wheels, but fit them better if placed upside-down. However, being upside-down, they crushed a little when I pushed my camper up onto them. No worries; I am sure I'll get plenty of use out of them and they are easy to store. Just toss these lightweight  items into any empty space in the storage area.
B009GNKCL4|5|fits perfect
B0030C1XNS|2|too small, not the size that I had anticipated, about 1 3/4&#34; x 5 1/2&#34;
B00CNA2BV6|5|Great product. Works great on my car. Twice as fast as using a towel to dry your vehicle.
B0014HUH3I|5|This intake is wonderful! It was an easy install (If you know what you're doing) and looks extremely clean! If you have any questions on install, product fitment or anything else feel free to ask! This cold air intake really pulls the vehicle especially during colder conditions. I noticed a minor drop in low end power but nothing that stepping on the gas won't fix. The pull is incredible compared to my old short ram set up. This intake is designed perfectly for this vehicle and I would recommend this over any cheap versions out there. Remember cheap is just to fit, costly is to specifications and tuned. Check out the pictures of the install! I also purchased the Hydroshield for this system. Injen: X-1037. Hydro shield is shown in the picture. Please also note, Injen does not release these filters oiled anymore. They are now EA Nanofiber dry flow filters. They may want to update this description. I prefer dry filters as they are easier to clean!
B0017KHTS8|5|I'm in the auto parts industry currently. I purchased these bulbs through Amazon at such a discounted price that with my purchasing discount at work could not touch. Sylvania XtraVision is the mid grade bulb, they offer one brighter if you need that much visibility. Amazon has you covered for just about everything. Also, Sylvania is a great company and their bulbs are superb.
B000GZV8FK|1|Battery is much smaller than described.  Description says 6.6&#34; wide and it is only 5.5&#34; wide.  The depth is about an inch smaller as well.  Don't buy unless you want a VERY small battery and are willing to go to your local auto parts store and spend another $13 on battery acid since it doesn't come with any acid.
B00GSAUHB8|3|We purchased this for our Honda Odyssey. The material is great and it sets up and folds very easily. It's not quite big enough for a minivan windshield though, even though Amazon listed it as a product that would work for our car. despite our best efforts, it often won't stay in place.
B003LITDQA|5|A+
B000GKEXK2|5|A GREAT ITEM. I ORDERED TWO JUST TO BE READY FOR MY NEXT PROJECT.
B000C9UL4Y|5|Awesome filter for my 2000 Chevy S10 4.3! Apparently these WIX filters are made in the USA. I am impressed by the quality of the filter. I run full synthetic so we will see how the oil looks after 1 year (or whenever I change it). This filter is much better than the AC Delco &#34;E&#34; series filters that apparently destroy engines.
B008S2XJF0|5|No comments.  Great product.  Very satisfied.
B00NX8EYFI|5|Shipped super fast got it 3 days ahead of what was quoted directions were somewhat unclear but if you use common sense you can figure out the non see thru side is removed first and then you can line up and stick just pull slow or you risk ripping
B00KTHZEZK|3|I wasn't able to program the keys with the directions I received.
B0012ETJ1O|4|Installed these on my 2003 Honda Civic. They provide very bright headlights, but I really haven't noticed the width and length expansion of light that this product touts and that I expected.
B000CP86ZE|5|Easy to install and durable
B00Q4AS1G0|4|as described.
B004HCOE8Q|5|This. Stuff worked great, made in USA .  Had small scratches on my hood where someone tried to remove some bird poop.  Really looked good after using.
B004IVGA0G|5|Worked perfectly
B00XV8IRKS|5|These are so bright and easy to install. I love it I get so many compliments, only thing I suggest is with the visor mirror lights DO NOT face them forward push them slightly to the side or you will not be able to look in the mirror. Yes they are that bright.
B008DQSE56|5|Pefect fit and color replacement for 2001 Pleasure-way Lexor.
B000ELAZ6E|5|nice steering wheel leather cover
B0082LFAI6|5|great product!
B000GGO52C|4|I had bought the test kit before hand, and used it on my floor boards in my project Z. I really liked it, did everything I expected it to. So I went off and purchased the silver version and had a much different experience. The color wasn't what I was expecting. It's very metallic in its dried form, but I just let that go, it wasn't going to seen. However this thing loved to bumble on me. Especially when spanning gaps. I had removed alot of the seem sealer in my car and instead of acting like a paint and just running down the gaps, it tried to span them. It tried with air bubbles in these spans, which since it's where metal meets together, it needs to water tight. So I'm now stuck with scraping this stuff out of my seams and starting again. Just stick to black or any of the other colors. This has filler in it for heavy duty jobs, I didn't know that.
B005HMLZB4|5|Great quality and awesome shipping
B00HLWNAR0|5|Speedy delivery.  Very good workmanship. Fits perfectly and great quality with a great price.
B0031XXW4O|5|Gives me more room and I was suprised at how well it's constructed.
B00MFK7QWI|5|Sound Great
B003UW1IQU|5|This will do the job, very good deal and glad i bought this, I have my truck and my wife's car looking like new again.
B00W8H4KH2|4|I was skeptical out of the gate.  I had a dead battery in my 4.0L V6 and decided instead of a call to AAA I would do some research and purchase a portable jump starter.  Going into it I expected to purchase something the size of a briefcase and when I saw this I thought there is no way this will work.  After reading the reviews and seeing it's functionality (air compressor, smartphone / device /  laptop charger and of course car jump starter) I figured I'd give it a shot.  Worse case scenario I would return it if it didn't live up to what it claimed it could do.  Same day delivery, I open the box and it has 4 of 5 lights on the charge so I thought lets give it a shot.  Straight out of the box, I attached the jumper cables, hooked it up to the dead battery and with the turn of the key it immediately (and I mean immediately) fired up.  Honestly I'm still amazed.  You can read up on all of it's other uses in the reviews and job description, but thought I would share my experience for the purpose that I made this purchase.  The fact that it comes with an air compressor is a huge bonus (the compressor has a cigarette power cord, but the kit comes with an adapter which you can then plug into the Viper batter pack).  I'm impressed, blown away really, and would absolutely recommend this product.  Update 11/16/16:  Overall I have to say that I've been happy with this but I'm dropping a star.  Granted I bought this for the jump starter pack and I've used it at least a dozen times on an old Jeep and it fires up every single time (make sure the pack is fully charged), but the compressor that comes with the bundle just died literally on it's 3rd use.  It did get enough air in my tire before it conked out which enabled me to get to a gas station and put more air in the tire, but if something is part of a roadside assistance pack you would think that it's durable and dependable.  Not the case with the compressor.  If you are simply blowing up a bike or stroller I'm sure you wouldget plenty of use out of this, but for use on a vehicle tire best of luck to you.
B00CFNNN86|5|improves looks greatly!
B000CB0KNO|5|Great deal, perfect fit for my 1989 Jeep Comanche 4.0
B004N4AOKK|4|Not an exact match (these are just slightly smaller) but did the job.
B000CMIG66|5|OEM product fit & easily installed on first try.  Still running smooth & quiet after 5 months.
B00838808A|4|It seems like a good product, but you have to take the cable off of the drum to install
B00MAQMZSW|5|Just what I wanted.
B00AIP4EE0|5|great
B00YJL6ZJG|4|they were good
B00JSJMV38|5|Tight fit for my 2004 Mazda 6, which is good since it will not move even a little bit when I am driving. It was easy to install and it has a good touch. Quite thick so it will not fall apart easily.
B00GR2W5KS|5|Came quick and was just as pictured/described.
B00122AXA2|5|Good
B005ETWXZ2|5|Worked wonderful. Havent had any issues.

B0058J4M5C|5|Only wish they were smoked a little more
B008P7XUJS|5|Looks great arrived quick, gotta love Prime!
B001PKLWM4|4|I purchased this as a gift and for what I paid, I was really expecting it to be lightweight and cheap.  Much to my surprise, it s heavy enough to hope it will stand up to the use it may endure.
B008B5U5U6|5|Works great.
B00ZGUEAFU|5|Excellent product & transaction.
B005257R0O|5|Worked great
B00QQWTGME|2|Though the package arrived on time and packaged appropriately, this is not polished. This is brushed stainless. Pics to come. I am going to have to apply numerous compound applications, and bench grinder polishing bonnets......or buy Show Chrome's version instead. Do not think this will match your chrome pipes, in regards to luster. It will not.
B004JV6OMO|5|Just what the doctor ordered, now I conflict the battery on my tab so it will start after sitting for a long time, also put one on my travel trailer.
B000CDCDHS|5|The wiper is very durable with a clean swipe. We did have a problem attaching the rear wiper and it broke. Thanks for to Valeo for sending us a replacement.
B007SP32MS|5|perfect fit 98 ram 2500 v10
B002HBY1BE|5|Exact match
B00KUI13WG|4|Thanks
B005SVXQS4|5|Easy installation and does work .
B000C918UA|2|I have an 88 vw vanagon, bought this muffler and the new one was about 3 inches longer than my old one, 1/2 to 3/4 inch smaller around and it was very hard to install. The stock 2 brackets were to big around so I had to make spacers to it would bolt up tight, had to bend the lower filler panel so the exhaust tip would clear. was a real pain the only thing that was right was the 2 flanges.
B000CQOIR8|2|product is good, directions are horrible
B007ZTN6GY|4|Good
B000TTQ29K|5|Stays tight even after 10,000 miles without adjustment.
B00OPJFTOE|3|Had to remove the reflector that was on the top of the bike for the plate holder to fit.  Also the lower right Chief Headdress covers  90% of the Tab.  The Tab is to be 100% visible to the Officers that might be driving behind you, or look as you drive past them.  So depending on the day and the Officer that notices the covered Tab you could or could not get stopped.  To correct issue, options:  send back, take a chance, or cut the right lower Chief Headdress back????
B005PZMKZI|4|Had to cut holes to be able to use seatbealts in the backseat
B00T6IVNE4|5|The best exhaust for the fireblade without having to put any fuel injection modules in.
B0025QAESA|5|great price for a so far great product
B00SYF7S4O|5|Will order again..
B00FH8P1DG|5|super bright, perfect for my UTV
B00HWWEKT6|2|Not what I thought they would be then I couldn't get a refund. So stuck with them
B005UGK6HG|5|Absolutely love they way they look and sound on my bike. By be advised no one will ride to right of me because they are so loud. So if you aren't looking for a really loud exhaust this isn't for you.
B00P7ML1S6|5|Adds nice color to the inside of my car.
B005UK376Y|5|Great product. Have used the hell out of it! It rattles a bit in the receiver but that is my only complaint.
B002672U7G|1|Shipped from China [ all oversea postage on outside of package] and would not fit deep enough into socket because of bad and cheaply made all together. They would flash once when trying to install. Guess that's why they were so cheap for two. Pure works of trash!!!! They got their money cause its too much to send them back and a waste of my time. Built like cheap china fireworks.
B00T36HLYU|4|These fit well and did the job. I was impressed . No vibration , stay put well.
B001JEIHAG|5|Excellent. Exactly what I needed and expected.
B00YBG5JYG|5|As described.
B00MI3OTJK|5|This screen is a life-saver.  It shuts out the sun as well as having a tree beside you.  Best purchase we have made for our fifth-wheel.
B0010GG7YG|5|Works and fits perfect. Easy install
B008MM0Q34|5|Love it!  Just adds a little something to the vehicle.
B003YJLAIK|5|Really helps RV keep water pressure that is usable and desiable.
B007AOS9LG|5|Great fit and protection of the interior carpet and floor board area also extends far enough under seats to protect for splashes and spills!
B0002SQU9K|4|It's a very good quality product but  not made for heavy duty use.
B0068EVJKM|1|No manual and took over 6 hours for a bike shop to build!!
B005GWAXWC|1|Cheap, should cost 50 cents. Go with a vinyl sticker if you want quality.
B000AP6RD4|5|K&N filters always the best
B006UNQN9I|5|Was easy to apply and so far has not come off or faded in the sun
B00P30XVQW|5|Look great, fit great. All around great product
B001GEB1ZW|5|Perfect fit!
B0018MITR0|4|This is OK for a thinner pad,  crushed down quickly. Would not recommend​ for heavier person
B00G6E1FC6|5|great bulbs very bright
B000X1XXXC|5|Perfect fit would recommend
B0082LJMC6|5|Great clearcoat product.. As long as your ok with having to use the entire product in a 24hr period.  This is way better than an off the shelf clear coat.
B00O3OI1ZU|5|Love it. Looks great on my vehicle. Easy application. Quick shipping.
B007JEJP92|5|It was great!
B001PVUJJU|4|as expected

B00KTHUC8O|4|Returned it because I bought a newer truck
B000VB66V0|5|A lot harder to install, than it is to buy.  But a quality product, and an excellent price(half the price of auto parts stores 0.
B00ENO2TLC|5|Matched perfectly with other headlight and was easy to install
B004I0M4WU|5|It seemed to be exact as an OEM. Works Great. The hardest part is getting the space open so you can remove the old one and install this one.
B008WHNHO4|4|Works and installs just as promised.
B006GJPDGK|5|For my '98 XJ with Chrysler 8.25&#34; rear axle, and Pro Comp 53111 springs. A bit disappointed that the u-bolts I already had weren't long enough, especially considering they were long enough for an OEM leaf pack with a RE add-a-leaf but such is life! These new u-bolts are way longer than needed, I'll wind up cutting a bit off, probably 1.5-2&#34; once everything settles and I re-torque all the bolts.
B002GTODQ0|4|Fit and look great
B003ZJ2HMM|4|Easy to install, looks great.  The glued on company logo--hit my windshield two hours after installation.
B001GBJQR0|3|I expected better quality.  The wire gauge was to small.
B00MF5FRV0|2|No instructions, English translations on package and labels needs improvements
B00ERIA8XU|5|Awesome sticker! Make sure to read the instructions before you try to apply it.
B003E26H7Q|4|product as advertised, fast delivery
B0050H29H0|3|Looks and fit like OEM (but there were no wiring diagrams so I had to find on-line) but it vibrates under speed making the images in the mirror fuzzy.  I torqued down the bolts as much as I dared and it still vibrates.  It was way cheaper than OEM though so perhaps that's the price for slightly reduced quality.
B004EKYB7U|5|Works perfectly for my 2006 Tundra.  Delivered 2 days ahead of schedule. Couldn't ask for anything more. Excellent.
B000Y8G4S0|4|Came bent, but other than that it's really good. GO EAGLES
B0087XOTWW|5|These are fantastic, very bright and seem to be well made. A great replacement for stock lights.
B007VRCJ68|5|good
B007GDV5F8|3|not as brilliant red as the photo leads you to believe. but hey, its from china, took forever to get here too.
B003BKVM8U|1|DOES NOT WORK NOT FROM THE START I CONTACTED TO VENDOR WITHOUT ANY HELP
B00KRNZRUI|2|Product is well made, my problem with it was the ear speakers are so large I could not ware it.  Make sure your helmet is a good fit for the over sized speakers.....
B000V4WMSS|5|Verry  good.
B00FFZU1S6|4|Great chain cleaning kit. I will be able to clean my chain many times with this kit.
B00BSXHMA4|5|Easy to install worked great
B00JUX1DRW|4|very handy
B000DINKPQ|5|This thing really works and very loud great product
B000C5UFVM|5|this turned the engine light off on my 2005 Honda Civic,,same brand and part number would have been 50 dollars more at Autozone, etc,,,and extremely easy to install,,,had to disconnect battery after, and drive 50 miles to bring back to get inspection sticker,,,am very satisfied with this purchase,,
B00S8O5RNU|5|Looks sleek and clean on my car!
B00FH8P1DG|5|Couldn't be happier, great buy!!  After reading other reviews I sealed edges of glass before installing.  Rain and car washing have had no effect.  Love it.
B002BELP3Y|3|Didnt work as well as I expected and as the other reviews suggest. It didnt really conform to the contours of my car and didnt cleanly squeegee the water off...just kind of smeared it around. I used a california water blade a long time ago and remembered it working way better than this.  The only thing this was good for was the windows.
B00GOW6VAQ|5|just what we wanted and arrived in 2 days
B00HHS4LKS|5|This item is great, good quality and bigger than expected.
B00JBIRBK4|5|Great for fog lights, not bright enough on same series low beam and high beam
B008LMO7Y4|5|has a happy feeling on the back of my camper
B000RFPQ16|4|It was what I expected
B0017OAL7U|5|great item @ a great price works well
B00F4PGH2Q|5|Yes
B00B0DGRF8|5|The are bad a__
B001O0HNRI|5|nice
B00BD5GZK0|5|awesome fit
B00FXM73PA|5|Perfectly fit my truck! I only needed one and could only find pairs and they were ridiculously priced! This was exactly what I needed.
B007KPTKD6|5|Waited until I got back off of a 2,913 mile ride to Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia before I rated this windshield bag for my Ultra Classic.  First of all, it arrived in less time than expected.  Was very easily installed in less,than 5 minutes.  Fit beautifully.  I used the center pocket for my Sunglasses and on the days that we crossed into Canada, our Passports.  In one outside pocket I put my phone and in the other, my wallet.  Kept everything within easy reach and dry.on the rainy days.  Velcro closures worked great although I would have preferred magnetic closures.  If I were designing it myself I'd change 3 things. 1. I'd make the pockets about an inch thicker to allow a little less pressure against my sunglasses. 2. I'd change the Velcro to Magnetic closures. And 3. I'd make the flaps,about a half inch wider to cover the very edge of the openings of the pouches.  Although nothing got wet, it looks like it would be possible for water to get in the pouches in a bad rainstorm,  All said and done, I recommend it to anyone.  Seems like a quality item and it was a good buy.
B004ME11FS|4|works well
B00CYKFCXY|5|Super nice. Returned because I bought a different car.
B00B0QWXW6|5|Very good item
B000BQRG00|5|works good, easy to use. Compared pressure readings from other gauges, all read the same.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Product came on time and was easy to program and use. Highly recommend and you can't beat the price.
B00RM26FVC|1|Deserves half a star but oh well. First of all the damn thing takes forever to actually ship out and once you get it , it's fun to play around with but come to find out it is cheaply made. It literally fell apart out of nowhere and the spring and shifter unscrewed from the housing on its on, it did last after 4 temporary fixes but only about 2 minutes. Not worth the wait.
B0030EVL60|5|I give it five stars as it works fine and the quality seems more than adequate.  It's not a tool I use all that often but when you have a suspect engine then a unit like this is indispensable.
B00FSIN0U6|5|See review of 11568304
B000BM8RT8|5|So far very pleased with it. I've used it to top off my RV tires and it did it quickly!
B0001CMUV4|5|I used this with a Tricam ACC-1F Hitch Mounted Aluminum Cargo Carrier, First I mounted it per the instructions and the cargo carrier would still pivot left and right with almost no effort.  I found I had to actually reverse the bottom plate so that the lip hooked over the lip of the Curt Hitch receiver. Takes a good bit of effort now to make it pivot. Seems to be good quality parts - recommend.
B008F8Q81O|5|Good quality head lights really bright.
B0068C3ACO|5|Used it to refurbish some chrome on an old Suzuki Intruder 800 motorcycle. Tried many different products & this is the best. Old, dull chrome shined right up with this stuff. Works into a lather, so was great for the old-school spoked rims!
B00KHB28NO|5|Installed drivers door latch assy,works as it should on my 2006 325i BMW.Great price for both door latch assy.
B004HXFUUQ|4|A+++++ item just as described
B00KRUCOT8|5|Absolutely amazing product! Prior to using this, our A/C would only hold a charge for 2 weeks. My A/C guy wouldn't install this, so I waited till the morning after he refilled our freon and installed this myself. Make sure to buy the can-piercing valve and hose. Luckily, I had an automotive coolant kit on-hand, which included a can-piercing gauge and snap-on adapter tip. Woohoo! We've had cold air for nearly 2 months now!
B00QZWMNWU|5|OK
B004BCWR0O|5|I saw Fiats all over Italy, and I now own a red Fiat 500 Sport, and I wanted this Italia flag for my tailgate! I love it! ❤️
B000TYTSPK|5|Easy to install. Works great!
B00AQAQI6E|1|One of the ten bulbs actually works, while a couple partially work. All I can say is &#34;Chinese junk junk junk!
B008ET00ZO|5|As discribed, quick delivery
B00AVFDWN6|5|great OE part for half the price of OEM BMW part
B00DSD4PX4|5|It's a nice sticker. Note that it is not clear. But it is for sure a five star sticker!
B0088COX4G|5|As described works well
B00GAUDT3E|5|Nice!
B00HESPG9Q|3|Not very sturdy
B00A9G5MFI|4|easy to put on with 2 people matches my tailgate
B00NGXTGI0|5|Nana loved this😊👍
B0024GQ0WK|5|This helmet just saved my life in a major accident, so I can attest it works, however, I reccomend a full face helmet, if I had worn one I would still have my front teeth.
B00NJ9HCXM|5|Nice looking license plate and really pops on the front of my Jeep!
B00BCH4WZE|5|Is actually pretty loud when touching a slightly dry surface
B008PAIWCA|5|Grest item. more support when hi speed riding
B00ZVJ2WEM|5|I got these seat covers for my 2012 Dodge Avenger which has light interior that is becoming a bit stained with years of daily driving and being our family car of choice. We all know it is hard to keep a 12 year old from eating and drinking while out for a day or even on his way to school. Getting to the point, I love these seat covers! They are a mesh fabric which is machine washable if you need more than a quick wipe down.<br /><br />Installation was not too bad but could have been better on a cooler day or under a shade tree! This set came with  2 Bucket Seat tops and 2 bottoms, 2 pc Bench Set, a Bench Bra for 50/50 or 60/40 split bench option 5 Head Rest covers, 4 Safety Seat-Belt Pad Protectors and a Steering Wheel Cover. I chose the blue and black because my car is blue. The blues are not exactly the same shade but it is not so far fetched that it does not still look good. I love that these covers are adjustable to fit not just one model but many different models of vehicles. It was also a plus for me with my Avenger that they are air bag compatible. The new covers look so much better than my Walmart covers that began falling apart after only a month or two. So far these have shown no sign of going to fall apart quickly and I could not be happier. We all want a good quality product when in the market for something like this.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. This opportunity could not have come at a better time because I had honestly already checked out this product on Amazon! The discount or company did not in any way influence this review. This review is written from 100% of my honest opinion of the product.
B00K00RKGM|1|I have a 1994 ford f250 i bought it beacuse it was led compatible not only did it not work with the leds but it did not work with regular bulbs to
B001QP5HA6|5|Perfect OEM replacement for my 1985 Mercedes Benz 500 SEC AMG (W126).  These also work for instrument cluster lights on my 1995 Mercedes Benz S500 (W140).  These shine bright and directly insert into the black colored holders for the instrument cluster as well as the white colored holders for the HVAC Control Unit backlighting.
B00MS9JQII|5|Ok for speakers
B00BYH6C1E|5|Stop the DROP!  lol<br /><br />After I installed this, I annoyingly would invite passengers into my car, and then demonstrate to them the effectiveness of these Drop-Stops by throwing coins, and small toys into the crevice of my seat.<br /><br />To their disbelief, none of the objects permeated the gap and remained floating on top of the excellently designed foam cushion!<br /><br />Get this and you won't ever find a 1-year old Taco Bell Hot Sauce Packet under your seat again!  (No, I didn't use it)
B004ATHDUM|4|Not bad I bought one 3 years ago that worked much better!
B004L035UW|5|Works perfect as advertised. Use it on my plow truck with no problems so far.  Good and bright at night
B00KIERDDU|2|The lights themself are amazingly bright and will get you noticed.  I would have given the product a 5 star review had the shroud been of decent quality.  There's some nice flash patterns you can use as well as the pattern that leaves the clear light on with the red flashing which is helpfull when you're on the scene.  First of all, the shroud really didn't seem to go with the light with it's attachments tabs or the quality of plastic they were each made of.  After nearly 30 minutes of trying to get it to click into place, it finally stayed attached.  Two days after I purchased this light, the shroud was deformed from the heat in my vehicle which is parked in a garage when I'm at home and in a shaded area four hours a day.  I know vehicles can get hot in the summertime but two other light's shrouds in the vehicle were unphased by the heat.  Until I can get a replacement shroud or have one made, I could only suggest people purchase this with a vehicle with a nearly vertical windshield such as a jeep. The warping may not seem like that big of a deal but this light is so bright, I'm blinded by it while driving at night.
B005AXKWPK|5|I was not expecting this product to work at all since it's pretty cheap in price.  I was surprised to see how good my headlights actually look after using this product. I don't know how long they will last looking great but for the price I wouldn't mind buying this product again. Highly recommended.
B001NIAH9W|5|Nice heavy duty strap.
B002UC30AS|5|well-made, colorful
B00D7SS7Z2|5|Nice transaction,  very smooth
B0035QYR8M|5|Good quality filter comparable to factory.
B000TYQB14|3|These are not bad. They last about three years, but are significantly cheaper than the OEM ones. I am on my second one (third including the original). All have failed due to water getting into the circuits and corroding the circuit board (I performed an autopsy). At the price, I will continue replacing them as they fail, but I am hoping to get a good one that lasts at some point.
B005BFY8I4|5|Bought this as my transfer case had 172k miles on it, and I was installing a SYE kit. Fit & finish, function - perfect. Glad I bought it, cheap piece of mind and mine was stretched pretty good. Also bought a rebuild kit at the same time, in case I needed any other parts (bearings, seals, etc).
B004P5MWFC|5|Works great!! Exactly what it says it is!
B0002KKTFO|5|I bought this to grease suspension components.  The flexible hose works great for getting into the odd places where the grease fittings are on my new stabilizer bar links. The pump action is smooth, and if you read and follow the directions, loading a grease cartridge is straightforward.<br /><br />This product is built to last.  As a non-professional user, I'd expect it to last approximately forever.  It looks like it would stand up to regular use in a shop too.  The head is solidly cast, the pump has beefy O-rings, and the body is stout steel.<br /><br />I would recommend tightening up the threaded connection between the hose and the nozzle, or at least checking it.  Mine was slightly loose and leaked some grease the first time I used it.
B000BZ50ZE|5|the work great for my ford f-350 2002 pinion seal on drive shaft or pumpkin
B0052UMLMI|5|Worked perfectly the first time. Would definitely recommend
B00545NWY2|5|Worked perfectly.  I have some painful scars from previous surgery and super tight belts just are too much to bear, but I hate the very thought of asking for an extender.  These worked just great - I only needed to add an inch or so, but still it made all the difference in the world. So very happy with this product.
B00WL0AXDG|3|Installation was a breeze. Look great on the truck
B00JRE38EA|5|Nice white light LEDs, no duds all worked great!
B00X6DDU2S|5|I really love this!!  It makes me happy walking up to my car and seeing it---and it's very effective.  And the side shades are fabulous--love that they stick automatically and we can move them easily!
B00Y5H05Q8|4|i like it the only problem was the hole wasn't big enough leaving a big extra naked metal on the shifter
B0064IU5FW|2|Feels Cheap, modeled after the iPhone, took forever to update and re-write itself. It wouldn't accept my 03 Suburban 5.3L's original program and accordingly would not allow me to proceed with installing a better tune. Returned it. Might try the Evolution by Edge next. I've never had good luck with these things though. Maybe its just me.
B00KY0NDCI|4|no problems.good quality and half price of the bid three.[parts stores].however....no lifetime warranty.
B000CJ01P8|5|Very happy with this product to fit my truck perfectly and it really adds to the look of my truck with definitely buy again
B003CR2BP0|5|So happy got my  car fixed. I dont have problems with emissions
B000BZJ9Q0|5|Replaced the original up and down stream on my '97 GMC burb with 310,000 miles on it. Worked perfect and easy to install. Cleared my check engine light and I can feel a difference in throttle response. Also bumped the fuel milleage back up a touch but I don't drive it for that reason. Great product.
B00IBH4VUO|5|Great looking  visible enough during the day.<br />Exceptional customer service i would definitely buy from them again.
B0041TUA1A|5|Perfect fit and works great! Fast shipping but box was a Lil damaged but mirror was still intact
B00B8TW7A8|5|love rough country products and this part was purely simple to install and took maybe 10 minutes from unpacked to fully tightened and definatly tightened up my steering and no more wheel shimmy/bump steer when hitting bumps
B00KCXUM12|5|Best team out there everybody should have a sticker
B00CMFF1AA|5|Works like a charm,  looks factory installed n I DID IT MYSELF!
B00LEBLI82|5|These are working very well in the RV and cars and truck.
B008YFTB4E|5|Great
B00O3QUNWW|4|Fits well. Good quality.
B005ESF2QK|4|Fits almost perfect, in general good product.
B00F7NLQR6|5|Good quality, good sized, I love it.
B007AJVE36|5|Fast delivery<br />Looks good on car.
B0009OR9AG|3|The overall holder holds a box of gloves fine but the magnets barely hold it to a tool box and it slides down.
B01184H9W8|5|This is a nice windshield sun protector cover. It came in a large pouch and fits the windshield for my van. I always have disliked the interior windshield covers as they never seem to fit well and are falling with the visor. This one fits well across my windshield and I simply tuck it in before I close the doors. It keeps the car cooler and I plan on using it in the winter so I do not have to scrape my windshield. Overall, a high quality cover. I received this with a promotional discount from the seller in exchange for an honest review
B00TE9UC4W|5|Can this set fit a 1999 Chevy Malibu?
B006OUN5ZW|3|Quality is ok, but the BMW ones has nice plastic frames that help keep the seal around the edge. These do not. I think next time I will spend more money and get the ones with the frame. Seems like a necessary piece to function properly.
B00A6X07I6|5|Couldnt believe how much road debris this stops keeps under carriage cleaner
B0044A8LGM|3|Not as detailed as I was hoping.
B00KFS11W8|5|The cover was more than I expected.
B006IHLV1G|2|This isnt a bad looking travel mug unfortunately, it does not fit in my BMW cup holder.  I have had 3 other travel mugs that I actually bought at the BMW dealer that does fit in the cup holder however, the lids do not seal completely which causes leaks and spills.  This one does have a much better seal, but doesnt fit in the holder, so I till dont have a mug that works.. How hard can it be???
B00063020Y|5|worked great
B001U8UUWE|4|Little worn now but still good feel
B00707B9AG|5|Product works well with the volant CAI that I got and you can definitely feel the difference when you get on the throttle
B00CLMBE5A|4|I'm a do it yourselfer and this was a slightly challenging install but I'm pleased with the results.
B00C309IBC|5|Awesome product. Made the ride much more comfortable. Well built and great fit.
B0084CMDMO|5|Fit my daughters 2013 Hyundai Elantra perfectly.
B00062ZDB8|5|good chrome and finish
B002LGUANS|5|Product was fine, but your shipping should be changed. Put the hard wear in foam not taped to the chrome see picture.
B0091KCG0W|5|I used it for greasing all brake pad contact points and for the shims. The product is less sticky than the moly goop that comes with the pads.
B000VU7CFA|5|Fantastic upgrade over the stock headlamp on my '00 Softail Deuce, no modifications necessary. Drops in, plug-n-play.
B000BRKYIA|5|Fit perfectly to a &#34;T&#34;!  No problems installing.  EASY!
B00SBZRR8O|5|This pump is really handy for filling my Jet Skis. The only caution is to be sure the pump head is above the fill hole before the gas can empties or you get a drip, It  has a reasonable  pump speed. Most importantly it saves my back!
B007RRS6A0|1|Is this really a genuine Honda Accessory?  I promise, my 2012 Honda Odyssey IS Taffeta White, but this paint doesn't match.  It looks white in the bottle, but when brushed onto my white van (it's supposed to be an exact match) it almost looks eggshell in color.  The minor scratches in the bumper where someone scraped against me in a parking lot are more apparent now than before I painted them.  Ugh...frustrating.
B00CWU4LQU|5|I bought this for my Spectre 9901 Cold Air Intake System and it was a perfect replacement. The thread pitch was right as well as the dimensions.
B00HSKT8WG|5|JUST WHAT I ORDERED ITS IN THE CAR WORKING GREAT
B00F2Q8L30|3|I haven't had the opportunity to use this product although it seems to be adequate for a DIY'er like me. The vacuum pump seems to be a little lightweight but like I said haven't had the opportunity to use it yet it might surprise me.
B009LN7UKA|4|The price was right, $150.00 less than what the local vendors wanted, the best part,  the part fit perfectly. .
B00I5055P2|5|It was very good great leveling
B00ZOT9NNW|5|I'm in love with this thing. I was skeptical as it is much cheaper than say a Chemical Guys or other manufacturers' version so I was scared it wouldn't work well. But I bought soap from Chemical Guys that is made for foam cannons and it works like a dream. I love it
B000WCUXU8|5|Worked great on my 2014 gmc sierra
B004W13LEU|5|Excellent look
B000TLH44U|5|Great gaskets. Thicker then then the old ones that blew out.
B00BAHALVK|5|It lasts a long time and smells so good in my car.
B003DL9DC4|5|Pleased
B000Q0CYJ4|5|worked great in my 2007 GMC Denali
B004A6NB1U|5|It fit like a glove.
B007KPUSNC|1|Wrong oil!
B00HS5HMG0|5|Excellent performance. No more vibration is nice!
B0044AZ44O|4|perfect one
B0033YJPNI|4|I had no problem installing the new unit. YouTube videos sure help. Works great
B00YJL8SXW|5|Haven't install them yet,hope they work as described
B004FWLCXS|4|Easy to install, but a piece of the silver covering has came off, needs to be attached better, they look nice though.
B003RW29FW|5|Handy.
B003PBTSYU|5|Loved it.  They look great. Thanks.
B000EDUUGM|2|it fit the sink nicely.  I left the adjustable screws loose so I could slide them to the sink edge for a good fit.  i gently tightened the screws as other reviews have advised.  I then put it back in the sink and wiggled it around to confirm the fit and the plastic broke.  I gorilla glued it back so i am keeping it but it could definitely use some work by camco.
B000H8QD6U|5|Excellent. Thank you
B00L4NHW7Q|5|This is a great set of car mats.  I had to cut a small portion of the driver's side front mat in order for it to fit my Toyota Corolla but it was very easy to cut with an ordinary pair of scissors.  The mats have good traction and are easy to clean as well.
B000TYOS3C|5|2003 Silverado<br />fit perfectly
B005ESF9GI|5|100% satisfied fits perfectly.
B00BBMDAL2|5|Great clip - I originally ordered one, but was very happy with the quality so I ordered another.
B0067DNV96|3|This vest was a bit snug, ended up ordering another one a size bigger.
B008BHP68A|5|nice
B00062Z264|5|Thank you
B00IIVY9DW|5|Easy to install. Quality materials and perfect match for 2015 Highlander.
B0002BGELQ|5|This device was used to install hardwired power to a Dashcam.  It is working very well.  It was able to fit easily into a fusebox with very little spare space in the cabin of a Toyota Camry.
B004JKW2J4|5|Product was exactly what we were looking for. It's extremely roomy and worked great, we even had some bad weather and rain and it did a great job. All of the contents were completely dry. Wish we would have purchased one sooner!
B007LICL56|5|Bought 2 different license covers and 2 different blingy screw/nuts and they all worked perfectly.  Pick your favorite and don't hesitate.  These rock.
B005BT90DI|3|it's not very efficient!
B00NIYXIYK|5|Was checkered but still looks good on my flint grey scion and opens easily
B00FH6ZW00|1|doesn't fit any trunk
B0052LI66W|5|I had already responded with an excellent satisfaction. However, from my comments to my son-in-law, he is going to purchase one as well.
B002XM5G70|5|Water pump works great!
B001PPFRZC|2|Didn't fit with my whipple sc so I had to have someone make a new tube for an other $250 :(
B004ETRWLS|5|Must have if you have the rotopax. The EPA spouts are a frustrating hot mess.
B00OPU5SWG|5|Good value
B000CITK8S|5|It was exactly what I expected, delivered on time, works as expected
B0024GQJ2G|1|Tried twice helmet size did not match what was shipping box
B00BMU919I|5|Lots of help look great
B00K1JZL8Q|5|Exactly what I needed, worked great. 2007 Polaris Hawkeye
B009YHGMRK|5|pipes were well packed.  went on easily and they sound awesome.  it's exactly what I wanted.  I get more power in acceleration because there's no restriction like stock pipes.
B000WGNNUQ|4|Good inverter but not powerful enough.  The remote control option is sweet.  It would be 5 stars if it were 1500 watts (then you could run power tools).
B00FBOW814|5|worked perfectly as a replacement for my broken one.  much cheaper than the toyota place was offering!!
B009T4OFH2|5|worked great
B0067UDH98|5|Yes
B000TCCWS2|5|This works.  Simple, easy to install and it works!!!
B00367PJTG|2|Love it . Simple and not boring looking
B0015GPQX4|4|great cupholder all the little things u need u put them there for safe keeping.
B00OUQ3FDE|5|These are well made and the carbon fiber looks great.  Hope they last.
B000I6I97W|5|Love this product. It will start a nice fire in any weather condition.
B00HSRNVRW|5|Great product!  Rigid enough to stay in place yet flexible enough to roll up to a 3-4 inch tube for storage. My black Highlander is noticeably cooler.
B00B71RPT0|5|Another tool that compares to none,  awesome.
B000C53ZG4|5|Looks great arrived quick, gotta love Prime!
B00RUEG8U0|5|This thing is awesome! Shipping was fast enough. Fits without any problems. Looks awesome on the 07-08 special edition Mean Streak and flows well with the rest of the bike.
B007JEJQP0|5|Great quality. Installation instructions worked well for my first time install.
B003AP584A|5|Seems to do the trick!
B007X50CHQ|5|Great size and looks factory. Looks good on black MDX.
B0096SE1B6|5|Worked very well. Easy to attach. Looks good.
B00EJA3E1Y|5|Easy to install, color matched the interior, price was great.
B009IKI88Y|5|Prefect fix for a 1999 Chevy S-10 ZR2!
B006870EGY|5|Firewall perfectly
B005US93W8|5|Great product, arrived very fast. I bought it so that it fills up some of the empty space on the front end and it does that pretty good. New bolts NOT included btw.
B000KYX5JO|1|The programming of this remote didn't go right at all and didn't even program...
B001BDGZW2|5|Great product.  Purchased as replacements for our sailboat lights.
B00X4S5VWW|5|Looks great on my 2005 escape
B00KTIYXLU|5|Works great
B000GV098Q|5|Item was just as described with fast shipping.
B002J7VX4Y|1|Really wanted to believe that someone could mix together disparate scents and come up with a bottle full of new car smell.  Nope.  It smells very much like the odor you get when you open a box of electronics that have been left in the sun or if electrical wiring was on fire or shorted out.  Wish they had a scratch-and-sniff card so you could try the different scents without investing your bucks.
B001DPNNGE|1|Contacted Whirlpool to find out which touch up paint to order as none of the samples looked like a match online. I was told that according to the make/model number of my fridge, this is the color I should order. It definitely did not match. This was waaaaaay too dark.<br />My fridge is black on the sides and a silvery/gray on the front. This touch up paint was a dark, flat gray color. Contacted Whirlpool again and they said, &#34;Give us a call so we can determine the color based on make and model.&#34; Called with make and model and they told me to order this same color again! I ended up emailing them again, with a photo of this touch up paint applied to the fridge where you can see that it is clearly not a match and was given a reply of, &#34;Give us a call so we can determine the color based on make and model.&#34;  AHHHHHHH!
B005PYHYK0|2|Very cheaply made and did not fit our Subaru Forester like was said. We had to cut holes in the covers to allow rear seat belts to be used. Also rear covers are too small for rear back
B001JT1CEE|5|Cant have enough wires, always useful
B001CUASKO|5|what I needed
B002UC4TQC|5|Very good product.  Works great
B00U5JXCKG|5|Bought for my '24 fifth wheel, solid & good product.
B00NHBYOA6|5|Just returned from a 4 week car trip. What I liked about it: No ice to worry about ever! Easy to transfer from the car to the hotel with the AC power adapter! Indents in the lid stabilize wine bottles even after opening!  Kept all our food at a perfect temperature even when away from the food  for a few hours!  Great product!!!  Things to watch for: Condensation in the cooler causes a little water to form at  the bottom; so keep after it or only place waterproof items on the bottom.  Make sure to unplug it when parking for a while (I forgot many times at filling stations and one time for lunch) but it never seemed to make a difference to the car or the cooler.
B000C75N26|3|Not very good quality. I expected better for &#34;Professional Grade&#34; parts, but maybe that means cheap so you can charge the customer more.
B00ZR51DSG|5|These coils works great.don't look any place Elsa.
B000C11JSE|5|Got it fast and works great
B004WJHADA|1|It don't stick to your helmet it keeps falling off before you even get on the bike
B005PZMKZI|1|Purchased these seat covers for a new car that I just leased to protect the seats in order to avoid fees when I bring back the car when the lease is up. I come to find that there is a history of these covers color bleeding through onto the actual seats completely defeating the purpose of having them.
B006WR3CFU|5|In traffic a lot  feels very comfortable on your elbows !!!!!
B000P17NXQ|3|Looked like a well made product but I didn't get to try it out because it did not interface with all the truck wiring and induced a fault that needed to be cleared after each start of the truck.
B002OUMVZG|5|easy to work with; all parts fit tightly and correctly - works great
B00HVHFYJ2|5|A perfect fit that not not inhibit functionality.
B004P0EHF0|5|Works Great
B001NZKDIA|5|They fit great and work great
B009DK8KW8|5|Easy to install!
B0082WW3CG|2|The only reason I'm giving this product 3 stars is because it made me so happy to see a bi pride keychain in the first place...I was very disappointed with the product itself. One side of the plastic housing is completely loose and keeps falling out, along with the piece of paper inside with the bi flag printed on it. I'll have to tape it all together before I can even use it. There's also dirt or something embedded within the plastic itself, making it look as if the keychain is constantly dirty (see photo). I'd be willing to pay maybe a third of what I actually paid for a keychain of this quality.  UPDATE: I have to take this down another star. I've been using this keychain for only a few weeks, and the metal part that you use to hook it onto the keys just snapped in half. It's not like I'm giving it any hard use either....it sits in the drawer when I'm at home and in my pants pocket when I'm elsewhere. Seriously disappointing.
B00GGV5Y3K|1|The spark plug wire was to short I had to re-route I'm not sure how long it can withstand the strain.
B000GGOOZK|4|Shades well
B00KTIR5UG|5|Paid a locksmith $2 each to cut them, programmed as per included instructions. Work Great, seem to be same quality as the ones that came with the car.
B002MEP17O|2|I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.<br /><br />Price is right, but adjustment is just not the same as OEM. It was supposed to be just right for a 95 Geo Prizm, but I can just barely see by setting the adjustment lever all the way back, but my wife has to move her whole body to the left in order to see, and that's not really safe.
B0036CVFJ4|5|Fir like a glove and could not get any better on the price
B000E347M0|4|The window regulator worked  as I expected.
B005C4GGVG|1|No good , they sendme, another sun glasses,
B000NWA8M0|4|easy to install and works great
B00QFEJVG4|5|Fits my 4Runner perfectly.
B006CRT72W|5|Works as designed
B009UKUURO|5|Holly cow, that's some buffer.  Use it on my 2000 Corvette.  Puts down a nice shine.
B000IYBFFC|1|Not happy. The &#34;see if it fits&#34; calculator says it is compatible with a 2000 Mazda MPV in the downstream sensor position which would be a sensor 2 location (or post cat) of which there is only one sensor.  I ordered this one specifically since it has an OEM connector.  The connector does not fit this vehicle.  I needed to splice the wires (I don't like splice connections).  Hope this helps someone expecting a drop in replacement.
B00HAOXYHU|5|fast good item
B0002MAANI|5|excellent quality very happy with my purchase
B000XEU8FK|4|Nice and thick for hard floor workouts... no achy backbone
B00THEY4K2|5|Very nice
B000C8Z8GG|5|Great product---no issues.
B00KWDSEY4|5|gift for a family member. I have yet to install.
B000AP6REI|5|Happy carburetor and better throttle response with this little ditty! I removed the old fuel soaked, crappy, 10 year old filter and put this nice guy in there... she is purring now!
B00DCULNXS|1|I have a 1994 ford f250 i bought led bulbs and these to make my turn signals flash they did but it turned on other lights too
B00MHI7088|5|Came in great timing just what I wanted
B00BISN2G2|5|Super convenient... Dealer is very responsive... Ordered several times already and no issues whatsoever
B00X5GEF8E|5|These look great and are a perfect fit for my 2015 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium.
B00BQS7BJS|5|OE part for half the price of OEM - love it
B001DKPMAO|3|Didn't realize it was plastic..
B001TI5IIQ|3|did not completely clear up my headlights
B00ZQFN1KK|1|COUNTERFEIT ,,,SUCKS,,,BUYERS BE ALERT!!!!
B000C5LIWC|5|Fit my 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis transmission.
B00GAVTRDE|5|Took a bit of fiddling to get them set up correctly, but I have been using them non stop lately to air down my truck tires for the beach. I set mine to 22psi so that I can fine tune the pressure when they are done working. Good product.
B000M6TY2W|4|Very nice pipes! I like the Cobra brand. This is my second set of Cobra pipes. Installation was not too difficult. However, the bracket and clamps come into contact with each other. I could not install the clamps exactly as shown in the instructions but close enough to work. The bracket could be redesigned to allow an easier fit.
B0020LSMFM|2|Appears to have a leak ate the factory installed fitting for teh transmission cooler line.. Metal into plastic.. Should have checked that before install , afraid to try and tighten. The fitting is metal and teh tank is plastic.. Fits correct , packed very well for shipping
B00VUGQ0WK|5|Great product and for the price u can't beat it I love it
B0089YVIIW|1|I wait for funds return. Is no good.
B0055AW0N0|3|great Idea and it helps but the cup holders are shallow and if the cups are not wide enough they fall out easily because they are not deep enough.  they need to go deeper and have some kind of adjustable cup grip inside
B00MXEXMSI|3|Love the helmet but size runs small so had to give to wife. fits her just fine
B000ALJ4NS|5|Used this to attach the button to hold on my rear view mirror after it decided to fall off in the heat. If you are looking for something better than the stuff marketed towards rear view mirror reattachment that falls off every year or two, try this stuff. I've also found it useful for other household projects that require an epoxy to attach pieces.
B00PQWN5DQ|4|The feature that holds the reading when you are done is very helpful.
B002E2ZUNE|5|Currently using these on my high beams on a '97 Grand Marquis. I find them to cast a wonderful amount of light and have decent throw down the road. In rainy weather, these don't reflect as bad as some white lights may. My friends have described these lights &#34;like driving the sun&#34; when they're on.
B004UQV3II|5|Worked like a charm.
B000XQ2S4M|5|Great pump.
B000E7YP7I|5|keeping everything organized.
B00WTCZK8Y|4|Great solar shields, fit my Sprinter very well (perhaps about 1/4&#34; or so shy of the edges due to how the window supports take some space, would have been nice if they had factored this in, but this is relatively minor nit).  As I reviewed on the front solar shields, this is the 3rd vehicle I've used them in, with the others lasting many years and easy to roll (securing with velcro strap) and unroll to put into place (held by shades).<br /><br />9/1 update:  Subtracting a star (to 4*) due to ~6&#34; of the lining on one edge separating on one of the three shields that I bought, and threatens to separate further.  Appears to be a quality control issue in manufacturing where the sewing was a little off.  My wife offered to fix with her adroit sewing (my fix would be duct tape), but this shouldn't happen within only abut 2-3 months of purchase.  Still, overall happy with the fit and solar heat reduction function, and would continue to recommend as a worthwhile (if now short of perfect) product.
B00UGXET62|5|will be very warm when winter comes
B00EDQNXK6|4|Fit perfect! Exact match.
B008MT9IEK|4|Works well and is a good addition to the pliers. Although I cant comprehend why they dont come with the cover. Obviously for $ but really the pliers are way overpriced for the quality to begin with, if this were included maybe it would be a better deal.
B0013RIOPC|1|Already started splitting at the seams.
B00GJIPV9W|1|Well it certainly didn't fit my 2006 Toyota Tundra receiver as indicated by Amazon. $10+ wasted.
B005UGKA7W|5|Really loud... installed them myself .. wish they had a YouTube video install.... SWEET
B00RCEJUYO|4|They are exactly as described but wish they came with a fifth for the spare.
B008K7PV90|1|These didn't fit my bike but I waited like two months to try to replace my old ones with these.  Doesn't fit Kawasaki Vulcan as specified.  Ruined the rubber trying to get them on.  Going to have to buy new ones from a different vendor.
B008I7NXHO|1|same as kool blue but its not listed as it kool blue box and all exept at a higher price works fine    update    its been less than a year and the part that folds the mirror is very loose and the layer of sinny plastic is now bubbling badly
B00112HDY2|5|Perfect gift and great quality! Fit my younger son's Honda off-road dirt bike just as hoped, in all proportions, with enough room left to not have to struggle with covering bike. Excellent, heavy-duty quality with seaming and all details just tops! It's every bit as good as advertised/described in listing and, anticipate it to hold up as so many satisfied reviewers, here on Amazon, affirmed that it will. NO downsides, no disappointments -- only positives, thus far, with this motorcycle cover! Have had for about two months of hot summer weather; expect for it to do well over-wintering, also. Will update, if that is not the case.
B00PT18QAQ|5|This tire gauge is great. It holds the reading so you are not trying to stand on your head to read it on the tire. Best tire gauge I have owned.
B00QI024QO|4|No complaints ,fit in my truck ok , They have no offensive smell .
B00BRRLPC2|5|Love it and im going to buy another one for my friend.
B005HAYDR4|5|Good stuff! Fast shipping! Satisfied!
B009OF7C7G|5|Excellent Product.
B00GOY1VV8|5|Fits perfect and looks great .. good material
B005OA0KH4|5|Got it 1 day before, and the programing  was exactly as the instructions said. The remote works great .
B00YE5Q132|5|This is a very good piece of kit for you to keep in your car. Not only can it jump start your car but it can also charge your portable devices including your laptop.<br />The power bank is very s all and light and it all comes neatly packed in a zip up hard carry case.<br />I have used this to charger my iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and my laptop. It works perfectly and charges the devices very quickly.<br />The power bank also comes with a torch at one end that is switched on by holding the power button in for a few seconds, then if you short press the button again the torch will go into SOS mode and one more short press will enter the torch into strobe mode. It also has red and blue light on the top which act as an emergency beacon and this is activate by pressing the power button twice, pressing it twice more will stop this mode. Both the torch and the emergency beacon are very very bright and are perfect for those tricky situations when you break down at night.<br />Now the most important feature of this power bank is the ability to jump start a car battery.<br />I have tried this on a car where the battery is not strong enough to start the car but is not completely flat. To jump start a car you must attach the provided cables to the car battery first, then turn on the power bank and attach the cables to the power bank, then simply turn the car over and hey presto it will start. As far as I am aware this will not jump start a completely drained battery, it will only jump start a battery that is drained enough not to start a car.<br />On the side of the power bank is a power indicator that will show you how much charge the power bank has left. You can also select between 12v 16v and 19v to charge various different devices. This can be done by short pressing the power button.<br />You can charge this whilst on the go via a cigarette lighter socket using the provided charging adapter.<br />This is a very very easy to use bit of kit that is very very useful andit all comes in a very small package that will fit in most glove boxes.<br />I really like this product and will make sure it is in my car every time I go out because you just never know when you are going to need it
B00A66GYDA|1|Bought to use with my '09 Mini Cooper S R56.. When I plugged it in, it identified that there were ECU codes, but didn't display them. It just read &#34;N/A.&#34;  for all of them.
B007MUY80E|5|Item was described perfectly. I need to to the dimensions of this product for the application I was using it in and it was perfect. Shipped fast and was as described.
B00J4YE4K0|3|Great looking lights for a great price!  Chances are the mount will not fit smoothly unless you don't mind riding around with rabbit ears!!  They do not adjust down due to bracket and the mirrors themselves do not rotate down to lower them. I picked my bike up and was not happy due to they look like bunny ears. I said take them off. Before he did I ask tech could he use old factory bracket and it worked!!  I now love them plus they are nice and tight and blue light on mirror is cool. Don't settle for the rabbit look or your friends will tease you to no end , I knew if I left them like that I would hear it plus I hated it but see pic, looks more acceptable now
B00FY3VJG2|5|had a nice they look very nice on my Shed and I had a nice appearance
B009PVCCFQ|4|Very happy with brake reservoir cap, just like OEM. Just a little pricey for what it is.
B002E26D62|2|This pre-cat unit does not have any provisions to mount the heat shields from the OEM cat. With this cat being located very near to some very heat sensitive components like the radiator and A/C compressor, I rejected it for use on the vehicle I was working on. Furthermore, the original had threaded positions to bolt the converter to the exhaust manifold where this one just had some oversized holes which would require nuts and bolts to install. I sent this one back to amazon and purchased a replacement converter from Eastern Converters. The Eastern unit had all of the correct mount points for the heat shields and also had the exact threaded and stud mount posiitons to properly intall to the exhaust manifold. It was also significantly less expensive than the Bosal product. I was very disappointed with this Bosal product and most likely would be reluctant toward purchasing any Bosal products in the future.
B00JIEX722|5|Way brighter them OEM. No error messages  2015 F150  , great look
B0000AZ3VS|5|We purchased this to replace a starter that went bad on our old boat. Installation was easy and the boat started right up. Have had no problems with this new starter.
B001FCTJQI|5|My favorite part of all of the chrome I purchased. Looks great!
B00KAK8GRE|3|These do work as advertised but were not nearly bright enough for my application.
B000ALG86E|1|the cover of the vehicle came with defects , was bringing holes in several parts, as evidenced in the picture
B006CS1FSA|5|Fits and worked. Arrived fast.
B005JU61D6|1|Did not fit a 2006 Honda Civic, even though the notice said it would.
B00C9IWWLG|4|Nice quality
B004GC6TNK|4|This bumper looks good and had new mounting brackets included with the order. It bolted up with no problem.
B004I14OY0|1|Socket for signal light is defective. I spent 100 on an electrician to find out and I can't contact seller.
B001V395A6|3|Good glasses just far too small for an adult male face.
B000AMBOI0|5|This is a nice load tester for home use. I use it for my DIY solar battery bank and it services me just fine.<br />The quality is reasonable, the clamps are not the strongest but I'm satisfied because of the price.<br />I've experienced load testers of higher quality at my job but those cost a lot more than his one. So hey who's complaining.
B000BZG4VI|5|I love OE products that are the same product yet half the price of OEM part from dealer
B000HTS5JC|3|Nice product, but mounting hardware it awful!  It probably won't hold up a week.  However, I've already thought of a way to resolve the pronlem with threaded rod and an action bedding kit that I bought to bed a rifle action and didn't use.
B000VKPS7Y|3|These filters fit well but they are not the same quality as the OEM filters.  There is no activated charcoal as in the OEM filters so there is no order control
B000N9HZWY|5|Works like it should
B00M48WF5O|5|Bought these for my wife and she loves them. Really like the glass look.. Hopefully it doesn't blind drivers... No more brights in my rear view mirror though... Only kidding.<br /><br />Go Hawks!
B009DJWOZI|5|Fit perfect!
B004XENLPK|5|Love it so much, bought a second for my friend :) n she loves hers!
B00F0VM79Q|4|Fit perfect
B0069TND14|5|Work great
B007J7E2O2|5|Great they look good
B009ZBSBMO|1|made it a total of three days and its dripping again!!! yay me, 1000$ of work later
B008QS4YQ4|5|Perfect fit; easy to get on; will be painting a pic on it soon.
B007WE7ZXM|4|Far, far superior to the stock seat. It feels stiff when you first get on it but at the end of day you realize what a comfortable seat it is.
B00GJJLCY4|5|It' can't get any more OEM than this part. The price is also unbeatable. Delivery: super fast.
B0046NUOC6|5|It looked as if it came off the assembly line with the original truck. The dealer shipped the product on time and I have no complaints with the product.
B00306KUB0|5|Its not a Japanese ATV, but SO FAR SO GOOD. We've had lots of fun riding around in it. Just make sure u stay on top of the maintenance. Also, when I first received it, I changed the oil. I ordered me a 3pack of fuel filters, a new air filter, to install on my next oil change.<br />Seller, shipped almost immediately, and it arrived in a wooden palette with a steel frame.
B00ITNLD4W|5|In a former life I was a professional detailer, and I tried every method I could think of to clean the inside of a wheel: cloth around a pole of some sort, wheel woolies, brushes, you name it. So it was a surprise that this worked so well.<br />It's long enough to reach deep into the wheel's interior and just the right composition to agitate stuck on brake dust. It also has enough give in its rigidity to flex around wheel spokes and clean tight corners. Would highly recommend this.
B000WJX29U|5|Good price fast service
B004YTOJ4G|3|pros:<br />-swivel mount makes it easier to position your lights.<br /><br />cons:<br />-the swiveling part always comes loose for some reason. no matter how hard i tighten, there will always be a small amount of movement. and it will eventually come loose.
B002Q1KN08|5|awesome product
B000CQ6G7S|1|it is too wide, hits the manifold on the side so the bolt cant line up with the stud  looked very nice though
B00YJ8WIB8|5|These were as pictured .... Very nice quality ...
B00MQ9BUCU|5|XL fit my XL hand as expected
B0009IK9DG|2|The brush is a little to soft for my liking, the handle isn't super sturdy.
B0062WC9IQ|5|Works perfectly with 2012 grizzly 450
B00TUNSOMO|5|Great wax for all your boating needs.  Goes on quick and easy and is super easy to apply and remove, leaving a clean, shiny, super smooth boat looking like new!
B0016LG0CY|1|Didn't work after second time I used it
B00YD2HN7O|1|Unit will not program for my car.  Contrary to product description on Amazon
B000E28N7G|5|Great price and great quality
B00CHJW20S|1|Does not fit as advertised on a 2008 BMW K1200GT
B0053TVKN4|4|Works well with my RZR, wished that it was a bit longer to clear the back bumper while hauling the trailer. Use a lockable pin, I had to buy another hitch because mine fell off during a ride.
B0002U268M|5|Does the job nicely and quickly.  I used it on my headlights that were fading.  I had previously used the 3M headlight polish kit but after a year or so they needed a touch-up.  This is the perfect product for a touch-up polishing.
B005CLL4K2|5|Arrived in a timely manner and fit perfectly
B003JBR1UO|3|Seat is 5 inches larger than actual seat on the king cab that it is supposed to fit<br />Making due but not happy about it
B0016IYARO|4|It does what it is intended to do.
B00GBQ740Q|5|Allows for much better airflow.  Have purchased many K&N filters for my vehicles over the years and will continue to do so.  Some improvement on gas mileage.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Very happy with this sunshade. It seems to work well, and is large enough to fit in the front window of my 2011 Honda.&#34;
B00AR379U4|1|Very poor product
B00O7ZAD6U|5|Installation took awhile but result was great.  Looks good functions beautifully and the velcro snaps soo much easier than other closing mechanisms.
B002YKICYA|5|Just what I wanted - it works great.
B00P30O1XO|5|It was a pain to remove the old one, but this is perfect. It clipped in smoothly and holds the visor in place perfectly.
B00NM2I956|2|Thought I was getting grills as written and shown....got a grill and it came in a box that was trashed and it literally fell out on the floor when the delivery man dropped it off.  Poorly packaged and the ends of the grill were all bent as there is no outer flange support tying it all together.  Its a welded flat bar steel grill, no aluminum billet used in this grill as its heavy.  The holes on the bottom supports didn't line with either of the provided bumper clamps so it is sitting and hanging from the stock mounting holes.  It looks good but for what it is $100 bucks would be too much. A jig and a spot welder and you could make it for $15 of mild steel flat bar parts and $15 of finishing and paint/powder coat.  I marked it damaged and parts missing but no response yet.
B007MD9F04|5|These made many car look great, they are stylish and very bright. They appear to be high quality and we're wAy to install.
B003JSHQW0|5|very good product, does what i expect it to do.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Great organizer.  Works as promised.  Plenty of places for items and does not move around in vehicle
