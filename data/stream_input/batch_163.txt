B001O07C9C|5|Excellent Product.
B0023VFRUM|5|Headlight fit perfectly,,,thank you so much..
B002XL2IEA|5|Good product. Could not blow out the sprinkler system until I got this, or found parts to make one. Now I just hope I don't lose since I only use it once a year.
B007TG7HHC|4|They are not perfect but they are the best that I've had. Some times they don't work properly
B00UNMWGNO|5|this spokes works for a Honda Shadow ACE ? is a 15&#34; rims.
B00H6ETIWY|5|We were very pleased with the quality of these mirrors for the price paid.
B000CNN26E|5|Put this on my 2012 Ram 1500 Big Horn, with factory single in/dual out exhaust.  The factory exhaust &#34;was&#34; nice but lacked in sound.  I wanted my Hemi to &#34;sound&#34; like a Hemi, and that's exactly what this FlowMaster did!<br /><br />I had it welded on for less than $70 and left the factory resonators on.  It has a great mellow sound when poking around and wakes the neighborhood when I let it scream.<br /><br />Cabin noise, another reason I picked this muffler, is minimal.  It gives off just enough of a rumble to put the kids to sleep in the backseat, an added bonus, and wakes them up when I gun it ;)
B00CRCQFXK|1|Be aware if you buy this you can only used once on your tire 3 days later this plug will suck the air everyday until you buy another new tire .....if you want to buy new tires this is your product....made a big mistake buying this plastic  screw.....
B004HV3UKU|4|I purchased these for my daughters first car!  She loves them and they fix pretty good.  The car's interior is tan so they are the perfect color.  This is a great package deal for the price.  You may not want to use all of the pieces (the pattern makes you a little dizzy after a while) but it is hard just to find seat covers for the front for this price.  These seat covers are cute, fun, affordable and very stylish with the younger generation.
B0000AZ89O|4|This installed easily and is easy to move.  But the cupholders are too shallow and the place holder is very small.
B001G4Z5J0|5|strong design, heavy duty
B00C6MPP00|4|Product was exactly as shown. Good quality. Fit perfect on lifted 2000 Toyota Tacoma. Works perfect to decrease body roll with lift. We'll see how they do over time...
B000H90XDS|5|Season in and season out, I charge up my car battery, fish finder battery, riding lawn mower, snowblower, and trolling motor batteries. When the green light goes on, I am confident in the results. Very inexpensive, economical, and reliable unit. Saves money all around at the can't miss Amazon price.
B005O6HVHU|5|amazing little light.  love it, great value. very bright.  the only flaw is the lack of a trigger lock/guard, but that can be dealt with.  Highly recommend this light so far.
B007PTUW6G|3|I bought this as a gift for a friend and shizuo fell off right when she opened it. We fixed it easily but still it was kind of embarrassing for that to happen. Double check it to make sure everything is tight before you ship it....
B0015YC0PI|4|I ordered this for my parents RV and they use it when they park it and it is not in use. Easy to take on and off and keeps things cleaner and less damage from the sun.
B000C9LMVU|5|Had an intermittent cam position code on a '95 Corsica 3.1 and fixed the problem with a new sensor. Just had to move the power steering pump out of the way for access. This sensor was the same as the original one I replaced.
B00EC107FG|5|It was harder getting the old one off then snapping the new one in.  If you follow the instructions and adjust the mirror all the way inside, you can easily access the clips.  If you look at the new on in your hand it's obvious how you need to pry up with a screwdriver.  The mirror fits perfectly, and it does exactly what it's supposed to: it reflects.
B002NVF6DK|5|this is perfect to my motorcycle (yamaha v star) i dont need chance nothing.. thank you amazon for sale a good product.. my bike is $1.000 more ... the installetion is easy ..i espend 30 minutes..<br /><br />k gran producto mi moto kedo expectacular .. con solo este cambio si la kiero vender creeme le puedo subir $1.000 ... gracias . la entrega a tiempo el empake perfecto muy bn todooo...
B000HVTERW|3|Purchased this for my boyfriend who travels a lot for work.  He is happy with it, no complaints so far.
B000CKXEII|5|Should have bought these in the first place instead of wasting my money on a fancy overpriced bulb that burned out within a couple of months.
B00B3HXWFO|5|It works great.  Cleaned parts prior to painting very well.
B00AZ68MI6|4|gives car nice stance, ride quality is not much different. NO markings on springs to know which end is up.
B00U5GKQYO|1|Door trim an others were not cut right too short
B00BOB0T7S|1|I bought 2 of these so far and the 8 ball knob fell off of both of them . Not a quality product.
B002MEJB1Q|5|Fantastic, Larger than expected so it's not too small which I was worried about, Multiple attachment options. LOVE the half round which enables it to hug and lay nicely against the console. Plan to order 2 more. Cost is very reasonable
B0049C6KTK|5|I have put these on my 327 engine and painted the flames red. They look great and go well with the Dist. cap, and coil. And the best thing about them was the price.
B0006MQJ0M|2|Sell under $20 and I would probably buy it.
B00S0UOU7Q|5|Very quiet easy to install very nice fit for the price
B005FNKSMW|4|I am completely satisfied with this identical replacement battery and charger and prompt delivery was very much appreciated. The Big Wheels rolls again..
B004WBN0JG|5|works great
B0002SREP4|5|These things work amazing
B000BO6MBG|1|We traveled over 1000 miles to Colorado. When we arrived in Colorado, of the straps had already ripped over halfway. I suspect by the time we get home, it will rip completely. We did not pack as much into it as shown in the picture. It was probably packed to half capacity. Very disappointed in the quality. I purchased it on Ebay but came shipped from Amazon,
B004HYLXEC|5|Great fit, just bought another set for my other pick , they are made with some heavy materials and should last a long time, only time will tell if they will hold up !!!😃
B00BITIEA0|4|easy to install!
B0070Y36G4|1|The package say 2...i only got 1...thats not fair..i paid for 2
B006BAQ6Y2|5|Read the 4 to 6 step instruction and try it. I bought it and used it for a 2002 mazda tribute and it works perfect. Dealers sell them for $70 and pepboys sells it for $59. You can't find a cheaper price than this.
B003CR2ILM|3|Had them on my other trucks I had.  Helps a little on gas if you can keep your foot off the pedal to hear the true sound of power.  But actual power again, my be increased a little
B00KY59Q3I|3|Earbuds are big and wiring rubs against my neck in the back. Will need to shift it around.  Sound is good though.
B0052XNOIA|3|This is a great wiper blade; however, was sent wrong size and did not realize it until I had already replaced my old one.
B00OQDCWZI|1|Would not communicate with my phone or my kindle. Tried all three and had the same problem. Used four different apps and had same results.  Returned all three for refund. Thanks for standing behind your products Amazon. Amazon 5 stars/ EvZ Interface 1/2 star.
B008RAFJ38|5|If you know what it is, you need it. Beats the hell out of Permatex.
B000ETUD22|4|LIKE IT
B005I3ZP7W|5|Fits perfectly.  Had no problems installing.  Mine was bent when I bought it and was afraid I couldn't find a suitable replacement but this was an excellent fit.
B007HRHS3G|4|Don't be mislead by the 17\\"x24\\" dimension.  The actual dimensions of the vent lid are appx 19.5\\" x 26\\".  The vent lid is made out of the usual thin plastic you'll find with any of these vents - but that's typical of the construction of campers and trailers - to save weight.  It fit exactly as the other vent fit.  I don't know why the attachment hinges aren't very secure - but again - it's the way they were originally built.<br />WARNING: The photo in this advertisement shows the entire assembly - BUT you are only getting the white lid, slider hardware - not the whole assembly.  Good price for the vent lid though. So if you have a cracked lid - this will work.  Be sure to measure carefully.<br /><br />UPDATE:>....<br />After installing - we did a beach trip with the lid closed.  It blew off somewhere before we got there!<br />So, I ordered a new one again - after calling Lance Campers and verifying that this is the one part number for sure.<br />I realized when I got the new one that I had installed the C shaped lid hinge on the outside of the C shaped base hinge before (which was incorrect).  It's easy to do inadvertently.  So MAKE CERTAIN you pay close attention to slide the lid hinge INSIDE the base hinge.  Many Lance Campers use this style.
B005ZVETZG|4|What can you say? It's a cargo envelope. It's what I ordered and it does the job. I like that is a genuine Toyota accessory.
B003XKMQSS|4|Not a repair manual, but a perfect replacement for factory owners manual. Can't tell the difference. Adds legitimacy to your vehicle if you're selling it.
B000NVW1LM|2|It did not stop the leakage.
B000WK3R80|5|I bought one of these and I liked it so much I went ahead and bought a second one. They added a little headband and it's slightly unnoticeable but makes a HUGE difference. I own a flydanna that doesn't have a headband and it's not even close to being as comfortable as this one. The difference is noticeable when you've been wearing it for hours. Overall good product and great deal for your money
B00VWMKV1I|3|Designs are cool but the package grammar makes no sense. And I've had them on for one day and they're already peeling off. Cool but cheap
B008B5VTSS|5|Works Great On My Truck. Thanks.
B001JSQQJQ|5|Worked great!
B001JT5OL6|3|Hangs really low. Cant shorten. Clip slide does not always stay where I need it. Have to adjust numerous times through out day so mic does not fall..
B008L23S30|5|Great product for the price. They get the bike off the ground with ease. The front stand is a little narrow but still works on my 2003 954RR!
B001GAB0B6|2|Most motorcycle jackets are in the $300+ range, and when I found this one, that fit comfortably, I figured at the price, \\"why not?\\"  I now know WHY it's so cheap...the material is sub-par in relation to other jackets.  I haven't gone down with this jacket (yet?), but from the feel of its nylon, it doesn't meet the quality of other jackets I own, such as a Joe Rocket.  The zippers are cheap too...within the first 3 weeks, the jacket would unzip it self, the zipper losing its hold, starting from the bottom and going up to the neck.  Just over a month, and a total use of maybe a dozen rides, the zipper has completely broken.  It's not an expensive repair, but the bottom line is even at this price it shouldn't be failing so quickly on such a piece.  I only give it a second star because it can fit any budget and is somewhat comfortable, but really, spend the extra money that you'll blow on repairs and just get a better one.
B007K80QVI|5|Excellent
B0024NM5T0|5|Perfect fit
B000QR12MW|5|Excellent I get well, I seemed a perfect negotiation thanks from Venezuela
B0016GRTVU|5|I like the &#34;sure&#34; lock mechanism which prevents slippage unlike older ones I've owned where you had to keep tightening the slider because it would loosen.
B005QBM0OW|5|It looks awesome on my friends truck. He was so excited to get it as a Christmas gift for his new truck
B00CMP3Z4E|5|Perfect for me
B002P8JGT6|5|Worked great!
B000B8JUM0|2|The top of the cap that you grab to screw it on and off is not as high as the original and makes it harder to grab.  Once on, it is hard to unscrew.  I would not buy this again, and I have always used Stant.  They used to be a great OEM replacement, not any more.
B000GKD5NI|3|This product definitely keeps the light out, but it is difficult to see through in the back window.  Also, the suction cups perform like most suction cups, they keep coming off.  It's okay, but you have to keep remounting the product over and over.
B000C55YKY|5|excellent quality better than the original
B007L4HIE4|5|Worked great very satistified. Easy install ,all was as stated I would recommend to any one this product thank you  Jim
B00D9IEBW8|4|They are a flood that reaches out like the sun. Combined with a spot light you can really light up the trail. The only problem I've had with them is a little condensation in one after I laid my bike down in a river. I would buy them again for any vehicle.
B001RBCU90|5|Very happy with everything thanks
B00230P2E4|5|good fit...didn't use any hairspray or adhesive
B004991N4A|5|perfect fit
B000VKPS5G|5|The item arrived right on time, and with the fit checker for your modle and make vehicle on the web sit, the filter fit perfectly... Very happy overall.  I received my products ahead of the timeline from an anticipated direct ship on an out of stock filter from a large named auto parts store.
B0040Z2GNK|5|Can't beat it for the price. Nice looking and reduces wind turbulence and noise in the cockpit. Easy to install. Folds down onto bench when not in use.
B003ZWG6T4|5|from the time i got it its working perfect
B00880AXDS|1|Junk, save your money.  I had it  one year plus a month.  Used only to grease my riding lawn tractor.  Ready to use it this fall, the grease female came apart from the hose before I even attached it.  Useless now.  Complained to Amico but no reply.
B000NCWV2U|5|i have one of this for over 30 years so this is a spare
B002XKK58M|3|Relatively fast shipping, disappointed the impeller is steel not alloy, I wish it was described better or given a choice on check out to select otherwise.
B003R2U3LE|1|Too big and difficult to place. By chance do you have the circular type that is easier to place and fold?
B001EOWQY4|3|I tried it out but was not working so I went to a trailer shop and they had one like it and theirs showed my truck was wired correct and they told me that some of the ones you buy online might not work so was this true or false don't know all I know I saw both and this one did not work.
B00B001QR0|5|These mats are larger than the factory ones and are cut to fit exactly around every nook and cranny with perfectly aligned holes for the floorboard hooks to fit in that hold them down.  Much better than the ones thar came with the fiat and better than I could expect.  No idea how they manage it but there are only milimeters between the mats and kickboards, etc.  The material is sturdy and the red is very fun and sporty with my gray interior.  Very easy to put in and stay put when down.  Divots catch debris and easy to clean.  Super product.
B00BSZ3BF2|5|thank u
B001FIRDBU|4|belt idler fit perfect made it an easy swap out of the original parts, no more odd engine noises for this truck.
B001FEOTN4|5|This is a very good addition to my Jeep. I carry a scooter on a hitch rack and it puts more load on the rear end causing it to tilt down. These worked great in bringing it back level again. Installation took me about 3 hours.
B000MS6ZJA|5|Works as described.
B00852684M|5|OMG my son loves these lights... He changes the colors depending on his mood.  They are so easy to I like them because when he is riding after the sun has gone down I can still spot him a half mile away, riding around on our cul-de-sac just riding around with his buddies.  And I know if I can see him then other people can see him.
B0042ORWNI|5|Worked like a charm. Took about 45 minutes to replace and grinding noise is now gone. Hopefully for good. Watched YouTube for instructions on how to replace.
B00004TZE2|5|Works as expected.. Keeps my rear trunk organized.... Perfect size holds just about anything you normally have in the trunk or your car or in my case SUV...
B00C1KFJ8A|5|Excellent product! I'm getting tons of great comments. One thing that the description doesn't say is that after applying the brakes, the lights will flash once for about  second.  I bought these lights to have addes awareness behind me, so I like this feature, I just wish they flashed WHEN they were applied, not after.<br /><br />All in all, they were VERY easy to install. The hardest part was trying to understand their weird way of measuring to get the lights centered exactly on the saddle bags.<br /><br />They are plug in play on my 2012 RoadGlide, so not sure about the other bikes.<br /><br />I really like the fact that they have stickers warning to unplug the lights before removing the saddle bags.
B000E1HWDS|3|Bought this item thinking that the mountain plate would be at right up and down but it isn't. Has an angle to it. Still made the item work for my project.
B001CF4UXU|5|Works great for snatching stuck plows wit extra long strap
B0002NIJM6|3|I love my set of Scooby doo mats, but they have one little issue, there are no rubber grips on the floor side to prevent them from sliding around. I have tried everything from adding silicon to the back (it peeled off) to rug grippers (they worked for a little while until the adhesive melted in the heat of summer). I am not sure why the manufacturer didn't think to add these simple little things to the back to prevent them from sliding around, but they are driving me insane. And of course I can find no other scooby doo mats that are rubber... ugh.
B001MXX5D8|5|This wax is great it made my car shine like new
B000P6URMA|5|Always the best bondo made.
B0031I2ZZ6|4|I ordered this to install on my light truck but ended up returning due to difficulties making time for installation. That being said, I could tell by the thickness and the quality that it would hold up for years to come and that it is OEM as you can get.
B00IFG5WDQ|5|Affordable quality parts and extremely fast shipping.
B001A749NQ|5|Good quality t-shirt. The medium is a tad on the large side, as far as medium shirts usually go.
B00GHT8NAC|5|Perfect fit replacement  with out secondary latch. I understand why the catch was put on but it was poorly engineered water and salt get into it and make it not work. If you can't get the tire off when you need it why carry it. This hoist holds tire firmly in place. Wish I had it on when I got the last flat it would have saved me a tow and some grinding. One bolt holds it on so a couple drops of lock tight is a good idea.
B0046ID5EK|5|I purchased a Marks Men remote from Discount Keyless. I was so happy that the remote worked on my car that I decided to get an extra remote key for my Ford Explorer.  The second package was lost by the US mail.  The tracking number showed that the package was received and sorted.  It never left the sorting facility. Discount Keyless was prompt and very kind about resolving the issue that wasn't even their fault.
B000BZEHZ8|2|Part was an easy and inexpensive replacement for a 1997 Suburban; however it failed within 6 months.  Thinking it was a fluke, I ordered another one, only to have it fail within 6 months.<br /><br />Since replacing with an AC Delco part, I've had no problems. The perforations on the probes are different between the two manufacturers; perhaps that has something to do with my failure rates.<br /><br />I'll gladly update should my current part fail; but, so far so good.
B000CM0WW2|5|exact replacement fit, come with everything you need. easy install, clean, the same as OEM but for a better price.
B001JT98S6|5|This was the perfect solution to my power needs for my cb radio. I previously had my cb radio hard wired into my ignition and hated it. So I ordered this item to replace that issue and it works awesome! Thank you for the quick delivery and great quality.  Mr Electric
B000CFO0GI|2|The bags are weak and might be able to withstand a 1000 lbs one time. The next time expect a blowout and having to pull over to disconnect the power to the comoressor to keep it from constantly running.
B001O0VRRK|5|Nice Pads. Can't beat the price with the rebate.
B004PXD9U6|5|Dear Sirs, I order the Fram oil filter for my van because wal-mart dosent have them and that is where I go to have my van serviced.I can go back to the place I bought my van, but they charge more for a serviced job.The oil filters have allways come in fast, no hassles, I have all ways had a very good experience.Iwill buy from this seller again, Thank you very much, Sincerely.June Johnson
B000WJX4BQ|5|These were for my 2003 sv1000. I found these at a slightly cheaper price than the walmart's everlast batterys. My mechanic says YUASA's last way longer than the walmart counterpart.
B004HFIQPA|5|Perfect for a car window.
B000IYRO4S|5|Works fine, but was disappointed that the key has to be in the cap to close as well as open it.
B00TH1VU7K|4|fits pretty good not bad.my delivery wasn't on time but hay I got it.
B000CIPHT4|5|Does just what it's supposed to: charges 6 volt Honda motorcycle battery, unattended. Good for maintaining batteries that seldom get used.
B004K5HOKK|5|The Moose tail bag was very easy to install, and having the option to remove it when not needed is great. It was nice that it also has the ability to expand when needed.
B00VQX4O7A|5|Works perfectly, excellent product!  Mounted on a 2013 Frontier. Although there are no instructions,  it was easy to find information on the Internet for removing the door panels. Would definitely recommend for anyone towing with the Frontier.
B0017J3XMU|5|My 13 year old Antron 305 had seen better days and as happens alot the top section broke off,,,,,,,,,, this new antenna attached to the same mast pole and coax,it was easy. Im getting  alot of postive feedback
B000EALHH6|4|Does a good job on concrete and pool decking (Pebble Tech). A couple of sprays and a little scrubbing and the stains were gone. I would buy more of this cleaner.
B00933GSOW|5|I had a problem with the engine warming up  and then running rough, missing getting worse till it would stop completly and not start again till cold, this coil/distrubtor solved this problem now running fine.
B000KQ4EBU|5|Easy to install - even when one caused the window to not go up all the way - slight adjustment and all is good,
B000E3EWGQ|1|I purchased these as a gift. The description was vague and when it arrived, I was dissatisfied with the product. There are only the 2 front mats and at that price, all 4 should be included. They were thin and made real cheap. The fairy was like a rub on and looked cheap and I wasn't sure how it would hold up from dirty shoes.T hen there was embroidery around it, that wasn't even the sane color scheme as the fairy in blue's and black's, but in purple and white. I decided that they weren't worth the money and sent them right back.
B00PUXE4PO|1|It says that is for ML320, it doesn't fit
B000AMXT60|4|I guess I expected the decal to be abit longer. Other than this very pleased with the details. Dragon is nice.
B0026KCJ1K|5|this primer really soaks into welds.  doesnt spatter or spit while welding as bad as others do.  my last zinc coating would pop and spit unless i ground almost all of it off.  this stuff works nice, smells bad, but wear a mask.  good for rust work
B001TJ1EJC|5|Ajustan perfecto en el jeep wrangler 2014
B0053GL5DM|4|I am very familiar with this product and love the easy quick release of the strap. It's just with these particular ones I received, they don't release well without the strap coming off the track. The first ones I ordered a couple of years ago didn't have this problem. Took a long time to get to me as well...other than that, they are fine.
B001GG0B8I|5|A very beautiful decal of a howling wolf, it stands out on the back glass. sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twentyone words.
B00H90GB98|3|This key chain was smaller than it seemed con tHe pictures. I am not satisfied at all with my purchase.
B007RUJ5HA|5|Worked on my 1995 Chevy S10. I took this part to a drive-line shop to put on my drive-line after unsuccessfully removing the old one. It mounted up to the truck as expected. I now have 6000 miles on it with no problems.
B004YR4E6Q|1|They sold us a part and it was wrong part then turn around and wanted more money for the right part ,i wouldn't buy anything from this company again , very Unprofessional
B001C9IZOG|1|I ordered this part for my 2005 Chrysler 300 but it did not fit.  The seller's ordering tool App on the web page indicated the part would fit but it didn't.  Very disappointed!!!
B003AY0MJW|5|Extremely pleased with the quality and price of this proudly displayed Patriotic license plate frame.<br />Would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again.
B003ZWGE8C|4|Ok quailty
B00L3P6Q8G|5|This is a very well made brush guard. The only problem I had was attaching it to my Silverado. I contacted the manufacturer that more then the grill cover had to be removed. A 2 hour job turned into a 4 hour job. I do recommend the product. Just have patience putting it on.
B005Q7BGBE|4|These seat covers were a great purchase.  I'd like to give them a 4.5 stars if that was possible.  The leather seats in my almost 14 year old Acura where starting to split due to constant use and abuse from the sun.  I've tried for year to keep the leather seats in good condition, but it got the point I needed to cover them. These seat covers were a great purchase.  They took about 25 minutes to install on the front seats and they are a very secure and snug fit to my. The quality appears to be great so far.  They haven't gotten to warm to sit on when they have been baking in the sun all day and they look really good compared to other seat covers I've seen.  My only complaint is that cover for the head rests didn't fit even though they were supposed to.  Lucky for me, my head rest leather is still in good condition and I really didn't need to cover them.  My wife was very skeptical about these when I bought them and told me she thought They'd be bulky and tacky looking.  Since putting them on she's had a change of heart and says they are a big improvement over the split leather.  Definitely would purchase them again.
B000SNBSMI|5|fits the bike great, used all winter and not issues, very durable and covers the hole bike where needed, will order again if i get another bike.
B005MVEV84|5|Awesome tail lights and adds awesome look to my 08 Tacoma access cab. they were a perfect fit and required no additional parts.
B001RLTTT4|5|Installed in my 2010 mk5 limited Jetta 2.5l and she is running so much better than with the worn out stock Bosch plugs. Perfect upgrade of plugs for any 2.5l.
B00W6LV6DQ|3|These are old school stick on the outside type. I will be giving these away.
B008CE0R7W|3|I had to run taps through the threaded holes to get them to accept the plastic (not rubber) feet and the tie down loops.  Also had to shorten the threads on the feet (hacksaw and file time).  The shape of the tire holding parts allows a lot of sideways tire movement. Don't stick your high buck Harley in this thing and walk away!  And there is no way for one person to get a full sized Harley into this rig without at least one assistant.  A simple ramp at the entrance fixes it, but you have to make one and the necessary design is tricky.  It's a case of made in China with inadequate quality control.  The design has potential, but it's not quite ready for prime time.
B001EZ1356|5|These are just what I was looking for. Fit well and easy installation. I am very happy with this product.
B003YKXTSI|5|Bought one for my wife.  All my kids loved it, so got one for each of them too.<br />Not the most powerful light, but it's sufficient.<br />A better light, left at home, isn't a good light.  This one is always with you.
B00HJ1KKP8|5|Put this on the inside of the toilet cover .  Have to laugh every
B0050IS5AY|5|PERFECT! LOVE THE SHADES!
B00BU44TOI|4|Good product. Pretty easy to install. Has definitely helped my fuel milage. Only down fall is if I have to change my setting I have to do a major reset each time and it won't let Onstar do its diagnostics on my truck
B00D47A68C|4|It is exactly as original, although the original could use design improvements. I wish someone would create an aftermarket design that functions better.
B0089153LI|5|fit perfect on my evo looks just like an evo wing, really easy to install, but you have to figure it out on your own due to shitty directions, other than that i rate 5 stars!
B000X8YGQ8|5|Polarg BA9s Type City Light LED Bulb - Blue VERY COOL PRODUCT, I USED IT IN MY 1966 VW BUG \\"ROSSI HEADLIGHT RINGS\\" ALONG WITH COOL BLUE HIDS.. VERY AWSOME
B002E59Q6S|5|The fit was close enough to replace the old one without any modifications.  So far so good.
B004UQR08K|5|I've never taken either one of my BMWs to a car wash before, even the hand-wash ones. Both the '05 325Ci & 330Ci ZHP were always washed by my own two hands, so I know that it's done right.<br />I found out about Griot's after looking car clay kits online extensively and this one was among the highest rated ones. I tried it and it really did make a huge difference. Before, I would just wash then wax (Turtle-brand) and it would shine (both of them were silver grey) but the clay really makes it vibrant. The clay's yellow but after the first time I used it, it kept collecting a lot of pollutants and so I had to keep kneading it after finishing a body panel, hood, trunk, etc.<br /><br />Now, after washing, then claying, and finally waxing, the paint looks as if it was brand new.<br />Despite what others may say (or the description), you don't need to wear the gloves to use the clay. It's not that sticky and doesn't adhere to your skin at all, just keep it lubricated with the detailer. That way, you can use the gloves while cleaning your wheels, working on something in the engine bay, etc.<br /><br />Great buy, produces results that you can visibly see.
B000C1LW0E|5|I determined the fuel pump was bad on my Onan Marquis 5000 generator in my 1997 Fleetwood Bounder.  The old fuel pump is located in an area that would be difficult to get to, so I opted to try out this AirTex fuel pump and place it in a location that was easy to access.  Installation was fairly easy, all the mounting hardware was included.  The generator now starts and runs like it should... I tested it for about 30 minutes, so far, so good.<br /><br />Several other people mentioned AirTex makes fuel pumps for Onan.  This pump was under $30, compared to $200+ for an Onan replacement pump, and potentially having to remove the generator to access it.  All in all, I'm very happy.  If anything changes, I'll update this review.
B00IRBPCF2|3|Okay
B00029KA7C|4|Worked very well.  Directions were not that helpful, but is easy to figure out.
B002N5L9N2|4|Trying it for the first time today..... 2nd day of 16 day trip. So far everything is working as expected,
B000RGVNKI|1|The wiper supposed to come with 3 or so adapters. In my case it was only one in the package. I wrote feedback about packaging the same day as received, it is few months since no one contacted me back.
B00CEKNBI2|5|THESE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT. WELL SEE IN DAYLIGHT AND REALY SEE AT NIGHT. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR LIGHTS, I HIGHLY RECOMEND THESE.
B001KPJ7SA|3|color off but its the same # for my truck
B00757KJTI|1|Its funny but does not work properly!!! Very small range
B002FHB3QQ|5|I bought these for my son to wear for his ski trip and they worked out great. True to size. Kept him warm. Would recommend.
B008YFTX6U|5|Excellent lights everything I expected.
B0038G45NG|5|best idea ever. i have it in all my cars. draining is a little slow, but, worth the convinience.
B00EHK0O2I|5|Love it. It shaded well and the quality is as described.  I am thinking of buying another one for the other car.
B000LG9AXQ|5|Very satisfied with the product. Very easy to use
B006WQ7WQ6|5|Used on my Prius C for a 450 mile trip, no complaints. Fit a lot more than I expected, easy access. Zipper felt really solid.
B0002MABGE|4|Works pretty well. Rattles once in a while when not positioned right but once it's in the right position it's quite always.
B008LUXS3M|5|Great product,  I installed them on my 2014 fj cruiser.  I placed them between the rock slider on each side.  Lights are thin enough so it does not get in the way when  I go off roading.  Wire them so it will come on when I unlock the doors and when I open the doors.  They turn off when I start the fj cruiser.  Basically,  it is wired like a dome light on the bottom.  It is bright enough to see where you are stepping in the dark.
B002DOME64|2|This is one of those products that didn't come with any instructions. I can't figure out how to use it (perhaps it doesn't work with my bike rack).
B00429NKWK|5|I bought this product for my father. He used it in the headlights of his car and worked perfectly, only had to follow the instructions for use and voila the lights were like new.
B00BLAG3D6|5|I have amore expensive version and this works fine
B001AV7SFS|5|A+ fitment A+ shipment protection (plastic wrap)
B00DJ7JJLC|3|I would buy it only for ground. I would get something different  for the power. I guess they have their own functionality hince the 3 stars. I hope this helps, Plus I think they are too expenssive for my taste.
B006NSN7OE|5|The sticker itself is durable. I haven't noticed any fading, flaking, or peeling.<br /> I saw this and knew that I had to have it. It now graces my car across from my UGA decal. (Go Dawgs!) I've gotten so many compliments on it. Most are some form of, \\"That's awesome! Where did you get that?\\"
B000FW2NEY|4|Good quality steering wheel cover, better than multiple ones that I've used in years past. The cover feels similar to leather, and makes the steering wheel softer. The (2) pads also are nice to grip. Only can think of (1) complaint with the product, which is that it can be more slippery at times than a steering wheel with no cover is.
B005M16QY6|5|Due to diabetics,  lower legs tend to heal slower. Excellent insurance for protection of your legs. Look at crash videos and see impact to knees and legs.  You'll want this.
B005HMPA3S|5|ive been looking for a rockstar energy t shirt forever and when i seen this i had to have it i drink those things like there going out of style im drinkin one right now lol im in love with this t and am going to buy the black one when i get paid as long as its in my size thank you
B000C542GQ|5|Exelente service, fast and cheap. Thank you.
B001TI5IIQ|5|I had to do one headlight twice likely because I was more aggressive with the #1 sandpaper.  Not a big deal.  Also, the instructions are not clear as to whether the sealant should be used if you do not sand the headlight (only polish it).  These are minor complaints.<br /><br />My 2003 Infiniti G35 headlights were not yellowed, but were scratchy and dingy and one of the headlights had three significant scratches.  After using this product, the appearance was pretty close to new.
B004ETGQKG|5|great
B001C0B6GY|1|Does not fit my vehicle as stated. I am glad I did not waste that much money.
B00703WZ4E|5|I needed a retro looking face shield to go with my retro bike and helmet and this bubble shield is perfect! it draws attention, which is what you want on a motorcycle and it keeps out the sun but is still perfect for when I ride at night as well. Really great quality, priced well and I've already dropped it once right on it and it only got one little scratch that's up by one of the buttons and out of my field of vision.It also lets in enough air to keep you comfortable, but doesn't make you feel like you're suffocating when not in motion.<br /><br />I highly recommend this face shield.
B00801RIYM|5|good fit and function.
B0007UQ2N2|5|Best water hose that I ever purchased
B008N1MPDS|5|works perfectly everytime
B00JXYKJ5A|5|Great color match and good fit satisfaction with order.
B009XX9GDM|3|Adds a lot of style to my Audi A4. The &#34;S&#34; logo isn't very prominent (it is a little dull). For $10, I couldn't complain. The packaging was good.
B000CI6Z86|4|Good fit and fast shipping , no problems at all
B002UJAXBU|5|i have the limited edition Bumblebee yellow and black Transformer Camaro and i applied these side vent decals and now it looks even more bad a**.  i was leary to put anything at all on my Camaro that might look cheesy or tacky but these decals look like the car has actual side vents (just like Bumbleebee did in the movie).  best addition i've made so far to my Camaro, it stands out from all the others.
B003VARMWK|4|My dad has one of these on his boat trailer that came standard.  I did not.  It keeps the plug up and away from the elements, and generally keeps the contacts in much better shape.  When I went to put these on my trailer, the self tapping screws would tap into my metal on the trailer, so I'm going to have to dill them first.  Other than that, I'd rate this 5 stars.  Quality product, seems well made, and sturdy.
B00E41XFBM|5|My chest measurement in a relaxed state is 40 inches. I ordered this jacket in the three extra large. I live in a cold climate. I also wear a leather jacket for a purpose other than cosmetic. What's great about ordering a three extra large is that I can put a few layers of warmth (Long sleeve thermal and hooded sweatshirt) under this jacket and make it down the highway without turning into a popsicle. I can zip up this jacket and have complete freedom of motion with my arms. I think if I had ordered a two extra large I would not be very happy. If you're going to order this jacket to wear for a night out on the town I would use the fitting guide provided. The leather is great quality. It has inside chest pockets on both sides with a sturdy snap closure for keys/phone/cash. I am certain to never get lost from site at a bike rally in a sea of black leather ever again with this red jacket.
B004PDE56I|3|Bought the product once and it came with no instructions and hardware.  Returned it for a replacement the. Received the second time with nuts missing in the hardware.  Box was sealed when arrived both times so I assume it's not a shipping issue.
B006OQ35GU|5|High quality.
B006O4BJPQ|5|I bought this exhaust system for my Yamaha FZ6 about a month ago, and I am very happy with it. The sound is amazing and, of course, it looks great! Very cool look that fits the bike's lines and style.<br /><br />Another thing I really appreciated was how easy and painless it was to fit this exhaust on the bike. AND I have the Givi-rack installed on the bike also, top as well as side-rack, so I was veeery skeptical since that makes it much tighter back there. But it all went surprisingly well, all I had to do was to use a tad smaller spacers, a couple mm smaller each should be sufficient, than the ones that originally come with the Leo, to make it a little tighter together. You can just use a nut as well, that's what I did. Very easy, just use a nut that is big enough to slide onto the bolt. Since you don't need to screw it, it doesn't matter how big it is as long as it slides onto it, and is somewhat smaller than the original spacers. You'll know what I mean when you get there; not complicated in practice :) So if you don't even have a baggage-rack it's just a cakewalk!<br /><br />So as you can probably tell, I'm very satisfied with this product. It looks, performs and sounds great, easy install/fitting, and I also have to compliment Amazon on their fast and easy delivery! From the time I ordered 'till it arrived here, and this is Norway, took only about three-four days.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this product for anyone interested in the features described above, I can't imagine you'll be disappointed!<br /><br />Hope you people out there find this review informative and helpful in your decision to choose third party exhaust for YOUR bike! :)<br /><br />Best regards, and drive safe everyone!
B00GTJAAVU|5|This is the proper top mount for our Saturn SL2. Our second replacement mount, a Frowny mount, had collapsed, bad vibrations. Installed this, reset the bottom mount and all is quiet and smooth again! I hope they continue to make this mount, they only seem to last about five years!
B002GXGDUU|5|I installed this system on my 2008 Mini Cooper S, it took about 45 minutes. It was really easy. Once installed its provides Great sound and you can feel the added horsepower.<br />Great look,sound and performance!
B00AAIHFGO|4|Was just what I was looking for. They works great.
B00AVLU3ZK|3|Tool was fine but when deliverd the case was broken
B00AH142QU|2|Not the size that it was supposed to be.  However, manufacturer satisfied me.
B001AZK1VC|4|The hand guards work well. Thought they would have had a stronger attachment in the guard itself and a longer adjustment to place them further out so the mirrors would see more.
B000CO76EW|5|Good battery hold down for any car. very basic and if u just need to keep that battery in place this is the most simple thing you could buy... good price too.
B006H34BUY|5|Very nice to have on hand for any type of dust cleaning, When you are allergic to dust - this is perfect!
B0081RKOEG|5|fit well for a johnson vro 40 HP 1986
B000H3Q2FC|1|Useless
B0043YIFGU|5|Works great. Does what I need to to do.
B000I1DJDG|5|thanks
B00W8ADB1K|5|Fits perfect and keep back seat clean. really great for the back seat passagers, keeps the seat clean.
B000B8N3IM|5|Works great on my 1992 Jeep Cherokee. It is nice to be able to verify there is no pressure in the system. Lifting the red lever vents any remaining pressure into the coolant overflow bottle. Will buy this again if I need a cap for my other vehicles.
B0013TM0Z0|5|worked well for a car that had no heat.
B009DK2P3I|5|I expected the item a week & a half after being ordered it came 2 DAYS AFTER!!!! VERY PLEASED & GREAT for a VERYY good price. Had difficulties at first and they were straightened immediately. Thanks!
B00NS36W2Q|5|$100 cheeper than shucks works great in our 97 p38 hse
B000BRL7TK|5|Prior to my purchase I read reviews that were both pro and con. These were ordered for my 2004 E450 class C motorhome. They fit PERFECTLY, have very reasonable thickness and offer great protection. We just came back from camping in the mountains and these are a breeze to clean. The price is reasonable as well.
B007TYPD8Y|5|Bought this to fix our kids window on her car. My husband is not the type of person that normally works on cars but he was able to get it done. The CS support was great, the first one we were sent was broken and they immediately sent a new one, no questions asked.
B0068EVE7K|5|Very high quality item. Work very bit as good as advertised  and better. Would recommend to anyone in a moving sport.
B00A2OBW24|4|awesome bright colour, fit my 2012 volkswagon jetta with minor adjustments, i had to cut holes for the seat belt buckles and for the head rests in the back seat, the front seat covers fit alright, overall im still glad i got them :p
B00AO7DTHU|5|Luv It! got it right away...made it into a car magnet!
B000CMDUYO|5|This is the exact gasket Holley sales for their Systemax II upper intake. I believe it's called a bi-metal gasket.
B001RMT5Q0|4|The only bad thing about the headlights I have one that is leaking and they are brand new!
B000VTTDYY|5|I chose this rating because the product looked just like it was on the picture and it fitted its description. I would recomend this to bike enthusiasts and those who are building a cafe racer from scratch or need to add reglamentary turn signals to MX and offroad bikes.
B001Y8NEX2|5|This is my 2nd roll of this RV Awning tape - but I haven't used it on the awning (yet). We used it to patch the canvas, windows and vinyl tears on our pop up camper.  Adheres great, is clear and waterproof.    Perfect addition to your camping survival kit - or as we call it \\"Tent Tackle\\".  Would work in a jif to repair a tarp, tent, RV Mat, sleeping bag, seat...anything!
B007SPUNSE|5|We have a great project to start on metal framed porch furniture.  We think this is the perfect answer. It was delivered quickly and looks like exactly what we needed.
B004U5JVM4|5|Perfect
B000C8PB1S|5|as describe and worked
B004EIDD2Q|5|Luckily have not had to use yet, but it is charged up and ready to go. Keeping it in the car so my wife doesn't get stranded since she seems to leave dome lights and headlights on a regular basis. Holds its charge in a cold car. Will update if I find it doesn't do as needed
B000C8P906|5|Well made kit.
B00R6S0MEI|5|Heavy duty nozzle. Solid construction.  A must buy for your home
B00BFDIL02|5|OEM and perfect fit for my 2005 oddy!
B000PIAQ1K|5|Just as described.
B00BKW444A|3|It is a great winch more power than I expected
B004FDY27K|3|It worked as described but DID NOT fit my helmet (zox). Had to return. Returning was no hassle. Wish it fit.
B0049USCVG|3|Easy to install! Not holding up well! One handle broke after only a few months!! Price is cheap for a reason
B0012LCX5Q|5|keeps the motor clear after a day of running through the dirt.
B000NJ97C0|5|I had been looking for clothes hangers that stayed put on my trailer Rack, these hangers stay on and the clothes are still on the rack when we get to our destinations.
B00B62PBKK|5|Replaced the original switch within 5 minutes and it was a perfect fit.  Everything works as needed, and all the switches are smooth to operate.
B0089LG9MU|5|I ordered this to organize the different items that I generally have in the back hatch area of my PT Cruiser. I took careful measurements, and estimated that it would fit perfectly - which it did!<br /><br />It securely holds my window washer fluid, motor oil, battery cables, car wax, spotlight, transmission fluid, paper towels, rags, flashlight, and several other things that I routinely &#34;cart around&#34;. I have it packed full, and it is sturdy and think it will be durable, too.<br /><br />Despite its size, I still have plenty of room for groceries, and am very glad that I ordered it!
B000BO6O96|4|Arrived quickly and just as described.
B009YR00L4|5|Fast Shipping... Great item... was a gift... that they already had to use....
B004LV948S|5|Excellent service parts fits just right
B00JCCKV3S|5|well, very well
B005IUY9JK|5|Just what the doctor ordered for my motorcycles and ATVs. JASO MA rated so its okay for wet clutches. Great price, too.
B00002N9G1|5|...and what more can you ask for? I was faced with the option of renting a UHaul or buying this carrier to pick-up a treadmill, ellipitcal and recumbent bike 11 miles from my home. It held each item which weighed over 200 lbs each. I made 3 trips instead of 1 or 2 because of my roof capacity. This made things real simple for me, and I'm sure it will do the same for you. By the way, I own a 2008 Scion XB, and it worked just fine.
B006NOFPHU|1|Not for 1996 oem starter.
B000SPHRXU|3|I'm very disappointed because dosen't came with the RED PLASTIC ACCORDION-STYLE DUST COVER  Like it show in the picture.
B004J00GII|3|returned it.  went with the Willie and Max 2 pouch -the pouches are bigger and fit my needs better.<br /><br />nothing against this pouch...but my glasses wouldn't fit very well and my cell phone either.
B00125MEVA|1|The horn looks nice and setup was easy, but the sound was not what I expected.  It does sound like a submarine dive horn, but it really does not have the sound of an antique car horn.  I was looking for the antique car horn sound, but if you like that prepare to dive effect this horn should work for you.  As is, Ahh-OOO-Gah is deceptive advertising.
B000C1Q6LE|5|Have had these on the rear of my 2004 Pilot for over a month now.  I've felt increased break grabbing and have never heard a squeak.  Would recommend.
B00515QXW8|1|I order the black/red and recieved the black/blue which doesn't match my red motorcycle at all. Aside from that the product itself is what I was looking for and in good condition.
B000IJ41NU|5|They are easy to assemble.  Allows you to save money and continue using existing wiring harness, if you have a bad connector.
B001QN5D0C|5|Exactly wat I ordered and fit perfect
B000WP38ES|5|On time perfect fit!
B000CGRO6U|5|OK very well
B00O1QUUKY|5|The Yepal Chamois towel is an excellent product, that is highly absorbent, and can be used in a number of ways.  Firstly, this product is not really a Chamois, which were traditionally made from animal hides.  It is actually made of poly vinyl alcohol, a synthetic material.  This is a good thing, as animals do not have to die in order to produce this product, and the synthetic material is probably more durable, and absorbent than an animal skin.<br /><br />This highly absorbent cloth measures approximately 25\\"x16.5\\" when damp, and is rather fibrous and has a slightly roughened pattern on one side.  It's very effective for washing or wiping down a vehicle or boat, glass, windows, or other hard smooth objects.  It can also be used for general cleaning, and because the cloth retains water so well, if can also be used to help keep the skin hydrated, or to cool you down.<br /><br />The cloth appears easy to keep clean, something which is probably quite important in extending its life.  It is recommended that the cloth be kept slightly damp, and folded up and stored in the resealable plastic container which it comes in.  Like a real chamois, when the cloth dries, it becomes very stiff, which is usually when cracks will begin.  To preserve it as long as possible, I intend to always keep this cloth slightly damp.  I have some concerns about the cloth getting scraped up when it is inserted and removed from the tube, so I'll try to be careful when doing that.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for evaluation, and I like this cloth enough to actually buy it.  Besides washing my car, there are many other applications where it could work quite well.  Available colors are a cool shade of blue, and a bright yellow.
B00JMCCSRK|3|Over priced elusive oil.  Nothing special.  Get the mobil 1 jug in walmart for $22.50.  Penzoil is is working the exclusive angle to make folks pay premium.  When actually this penz ultra is a worse formulation when compared to 2009 ultra...which was also hard to get.<br /><br />In the end all SL oils are SL oils, save your money and use it to buy 5 more gallons of fuel.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Facts for those who don't read comments:<br /><br />Sure:<br />Read this and then follow the next link: http://www.bobistheoilguy.com/whats-in-your-motor-oil/<br /><br />Then compare the NOACK numbers.<br />http://www.epc.shell.com/Docs/GPCDOC_X_cbe_24855_key_140007304052_201207271342.pdf<br />http://www.epc.shell.com/Docs/GPCDOC_GTDS_Pennzoil_Ultra_Platinum_5W-20_%28SN_GF-5%29_%28en%29_TDS.pdf<br /><br />form your own conclusion
B000CN7OEA|5|This was a replacement for a old one that was bent and not working correctly. This new one works great.
B0050PYQUK|5|Great quality, fits extremely well and like some others, I love the leather lined inside pockets. Delivered in 2 days. Great buy all around.
B009DK28UI|5|Excellent!  Worked perfectly!  Haven't had a problem since install.
B00846HT38|5|First mod that my wife actually liked a lot. Looks like it belongs on the car. Great job, all the Craven people!
B001QVPHBO|5|Perfect for close quarters. Not alot of reach but convenient in alot of situations. Sometimes you need a little length, the rest of the time i use this one.
B008BMQYGI|5|my car has  everything Jack Skellington and this completed my collection. I love the way it looks on the car!
B007O86QCM|5|Super light weight, easy to use, easy to clean and it looks sharp!  I use it at home and do not carry it around in my pocket.  If you're buying this to carry around in your pocket you might need to put a small rubberband around it so the lid is secure.  The last thing you need is a bunch of ash in your pocket.
B00480BWCI|5|usefull tool for all RV's and campers
B00FD90YNQ|5|Love it.  Haven't seen one like this on any other vehicle
B003JHC42I|5|I bought these for my 2010 Toyota Tundra and they fit PERFECTLY!  They even have the two holes for the drivers side mat where the clips go through to hold it in place.  They look good, not to mention extremely durable.  I'm so glad I went with WeatherTech instead of the other brands.
B00BSA8SJ6|5|Bought this for my dad for Fathers Day this past year and he loves the thing. He keeps it in his old pickup and has used it several times. The magnet on the bottom is very strong and more handy than I originally expected it to be, and it's very convenient to have a flexible bending neck on it. The beam from the LEDs is not super bright or super condensed but this isn't made to be your main work light in your shop, it's made for emergency lighting or while camping, etc.
B00IKZTRLA|5|Looks like it's part of my truck, love it
B000H8W3XC|5|Best for the money. Couldnt believe how perfect this was. Would buy more the next time I need another one.
B0007LEG2K|5|I bought this and have used it numerous times to pull numerous codes on numerous cars. Afterward, I Google the code with the car make/model and find people who have pulled the same codes and how they fixed them. This has not failed me yet in diagnosing problems correctly. This is a great product for reading codes and diagnosing problems, as well as erasing codes to see if you actually fixed your problem.     Highly Recommended for any car guy/gal.
B004GELAS2|5|Great,  thanks.
B000IO72ZY|5|looks nice
B0002KR88A|5|This is a. Nice holder for fuses but dos not fit multi- breakers. At least with the weather proof cap. Don't get me wrong the breaker fits the contacts, with a little case trimming add some hot melt glue to the mix and you have a waterproof unit. That by the way is working great in rainy Oregon.
B000JQH300|5|We use our Suburban for fishing trips, and wet wading boots aren't compatible with the stock carpet mats. These fit perfectly, catch all the grime, and the raised lip contains debris within the mat (just remember to raise your foot and not drag it on the lip when entering). Very easy to remove and clean.
B0006302KY|1|When I was in my early twenties I worked as a porter for a car dealership detailing cars.  My boss encouraged me to try different products, and I found I liked 3M waxes the best.  I was in the store the other day and needed some wax, but they didn't carry 3M products.  So I saw this stuff for only a quarter of the price that I normally spend on 3M wax.  So I decided to give it a try.  This wax hardened up like it had been left in the sun and took me an hour and a half to buff out.  I threw it away afterworlds and will go buy some 3M now.  Turtle wax is the worst wax I have ever used. I would have been fired if I used this at the dealership.
B00480BWCI|5|Cheap price, but perfect to do the job.Not bulky, easy to clean, and very compact for storing with a handy, and durable storage bag.<br />Shipping was excellent, just a couple of days with normal shipping. Very satisfied.
B00A6G5R4W|5|excellent value
B00J62QKF2|5|Awesome!!!
B000NKCM2G|5|This is a great product that added a lot of performance to my Patriot.  I notice myself purposely flooring it to hear the roar it adds to the engine. Installation was a little tricky getting the old air filter tube disconnected from the front of the engine, but once that was off, everything was smooth sailing.
B00KCXMCTM|5|Works perfect for the project that had.
B000CEZR0W|1|The one I received does not look like the picture.  The one I received only had a single hole to measure the gases and kept on tripping my check engine light.  Got a replacement thinking I got a bad one and same issue.  Now got the NGK 24651  and my car is back to normal.
B0061R1KCI|4|These are a perfect fit for my '11 F150 Lariat. I like that they pop up when needed but stay down and out of the way the rest of the time. They were easy to install but one of the screws was defective (the top was only partially formed so you couldn't put a screwdriver to it). I went to the hardware store and bought a new screw for next to nothing. Not sure how these will hold up as water, ice and snow get into them but I guess I'll find out this winter. They look factory installed and I'm fairly happy.
B000CMH54U|4|Great replacement part for mag wheels.
B00J6DQNVC|4|ok
B000E268C8|5|just as described
B0009IBJCQ|5|My husband and son have not had an opportunity to use these yet, but I know they will do a good job.  My husband had one before, and it lasted several years.  Schmacher is a good product.  Prompt shipping also.
B000GZL29M|5|The charger meets my hopes and expectations, and I can't think of any improvements or changes that the charger needs. I use it almost continuously to keep my Suzuki battery charged and floating, so the next hurdle will be operation and reliability after years (I hope) of extended use.
B00GDT00I4|5|I was looking for a Get Back but couldn't find one I liked.  I immediately fell in love with this one when I saw the skulls and .45 cases on the end!  The quick release clamp holds firmly yet releases with ease when you need to deploy it.
B007HSN7KI|5|Fit my Prius 3 , 2015 perfectly.<br /><br />I just received this matts and went to put them in my car. I was happy to see how the custom fit was perfect.<br />I have used this brand in the cargo area of my Nissan Murano, and it has always protected my car (even when I got an spill of a laundry detergent gallon conteiner that I bought in Cotsco!). So I knew that the brand is excelent.<br />I recommend this product to anyone.
B00075OSCO|5|THE BEST
B000BQSKA0|1|If safety and environmental protection are the objectives of the Scepter Eco can's spout design, the designers deserve incarceration. I thought after purchasing the 5- gallon Scepter Eco from Home Depot and experiencing leaks through the vent that my experience might probably be a singular defective event. Not so! After purchasing from Lowes a second Sceptre 2.5 gallon can with its green twist and push spout system, I am frustrated and totally disgusted that it too leaks miserably at the vent point. Every time I attempt to fill there is fuel spilling over my fingers and hand, onto the line trimmer, mower, or snow blower. Home Depot advertises this product as senior friendly? Really? Let's see, you have a spring-loaded hard to twist collar (the green thing) you have to hold in a tense grip while pushing against a strong spring to depress the spout to achieve flow. Other than pushing against the tool or appliance's fuel opening you have to use your other hand to push the spout into the dispense position. Now BOTH hands are covered with fuel from the leaking vent collar while fuel has spilled on the tool, drive and ground. The environment has been polluted with undesirable evaporated fumes, you have been contaminated, your equipment is covered with fuel and you the user is put at risk for disastrous fire injury. This can's spout design is a prime example of government regulation colliding with ill-conceived design or poorly executed manufacturing to totally defeat the intent. A mess. If I could have given this product a zero rating I would have. This design poses a real health and safety disaster waiting to happen.  I've checked other competitors and they all sell the same design.  As a service to those reading this review, be assured that there is a competitive gas can that doesn't leak fuel while dispensing. Buy the No-Spill gas can[[ASIN:B000W72GBC No-Spill 1405 2-1/2-Gallon Poly Gas Can (CARB Compliant)]]. While costing almost twice as much as Scepter's, it actually works. Save yourself a potential burn injury and our environment by boycotting all of these unsafe products featuring the green twist vent system.  Amazon would be wise to pull all can's using the twist and push design from their offering.<br />Cons:<br />Difficult to Use, not environmentally friendly, not senior friendly, dangerous
B000NVW1LM|5|It really works awesome with seals
B007GCWV2U|5|Nice size and very clear.
B003UXZ6RG|5|This is a good purchase, however, some may be &#34;turned off&#34; by the diameter of the cover if you have small hands
B002MYLB1Y|5|Good price, worked with heavy motorcycles, all went well.  Took them on  a long trip with heavy bikes and they held up just fine.
B00M1OUBES|2|did not work as they claimed. I fully charged it and tried to boost an 05 mdx. my alarm did not even go off.
B001CEG90I|5|Fit perfect on my car and my wife's car. Delivered on time as scheduled every 4 months. A+
B004C0ZYZ0|5|super cheap really repaired my son's 1999 Mercury Cougar power windows using this really. Great seller
B000A8QLUA|5|Excellent !!!
B001LHXTO0|5|always wanted one of these. we have several auto projects, so this helped with the repairs and finding the problems.
B0093AB0ZC|4|Fits as described, shield is thicker than the ones you will get at your local auto parts store, whichis a good thing, better protection. Still working on folding it...due to the thickness,
B00630IZYO|2|These all kinda smell the same. It's a little too much for a car. I'm sad because it sounded great.
B004YOXUM8|5|Looks good, light and strong.  Easy to move around in.
B00EPDLEQ2|5|Plate is just as described and shipped very quickly
B000M5Y720|5|Works as advertised.  Saved some money as well over a local big box auto parts store.
B0054M4F3C|3|The ad is misleading. Looks like you get a whole box instead of just one air freshener.
B000C9NG6E|5|I used this on my 2001 Saturn SC 2. So far its lasted about 15k miles without any problems. Seems well built
B000BQW5LK|4|It does what it's supposed to do...  it pumps oil from quart sized bottles for under $8<br /><br />The pickup tube should be seated firmly into the base of the pump.  Measure the length of the pump body from the bottom of the threaded cap to the bottom of the pickup tube; compare that measurement to depth of the quart bottle.  Is the pickup tube a little short?  Cut some of the clear vinyl 'fill tubing' and add it to the bottom of the pickup tube.<br /><br />Ensure fill tube isn't kinked, and is fully inserted into component (trans, diff etc.) Pump with full-stroke, steady pumps until job is complete.<br /><br />This is not a professional grade tool, but it will still do what it's supposed to do.
B009FNZF6C|5|Fit perfect and works better the OEM.
B000HACYNY|5|great product and a great value. sure saved me this cold icey ny winter.  great design and feel order now.
B009RJOL1Y|5|Awesome product. Love amazon
B000MX2ORM|5|Great original battery!
B000OF10BY|4|we are avid users of the porta power system but just a warning. we had several pieces break on a previous one by maxing the ram out with extensions and the ram toe. please read the ratings in the owners manual to see the ratings using different configurations
B00AOAQ4HE|5|I ordered this fuel pump for a 98 Chevy Astro Van. When this pump arrived, I quickly dropped the fuel tank off the van and removed the old pump. I went ahead and compared the two (the vehicle owner has had this vehicle for a while, and the new pump would be number three since it's been owned).<br /><br />Well, I compared the new and old pump, and they were exactly the same. Down to the plastic markings on the case and everything except for the fuel level sensor. The new pump had a different pattern of contacts versus the old pump. The needle in the dash for fuel level use to &#34;vibrate&#34;, and after installing the new pump, the gas gauge &#34;vibration&#34; vanished.<br /><br />This pump has been installed for about a month so far (July 2014 - Aug 2014), and I did not have any problems since installing it.<br /><br />The old pump that I pulled out was a parts store brand that the owner had installed about a year and a half. The [old] receipt showed the vehicle owner paid over $250 for.<br /><br />This new pump came in two days after i ordered it. It was packed very well and protected by thick bubble wrap.
B00B3P26N0|5|I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!! Trust me, the reactions you get form ppl while you at a stop like is HILARIOUS!!! Especially when they are the ones with a stick figure family on their mini vans
B004A34G94|5|Exactly what I needed very quick delivery.  reasonable price.  half of what the dealers wanted.
B00DDQ19LM|5|Awesome ..look good on my vehicle
B000CMKDYE|5|Fit our 2003 Mazda Tribute perfectly and really cuts down on dirt as we have a dirt driveway and a mess in winter!
B0035DLJ2M|5|It is quality name I don't dought it from past experience.
B008WV1350|5|Good Product.
B001817O90|5|Great quality. Gave it to my daughter for her SRX.
B00LLIRRMY|5|This is a very nice vest. The collar and pockets make it look very clean and distinguished. My boyfriend loves it. It is smooth back and perfect for sewing a club or large back patch on the back. The side laces allow for great adjustment and it has plenty of pockets.
B00065JM8U|4|Worked very good and a great price!
B0015PTTTW|5|My husband bought these for his Dodge Ram and they fit perfect! They look sleek, not cheap, and he was very pleased with them. He installed them himself without any issues. Took him maybe 30 minutes. Great buy!
B004MTHH60|3|I used it on my 1981 gmc truck to pull apart the frame it worked great but what it don't tell you is how to use it so I went on youtube and looked it up . first time I used it started to leak oil because it also dose not tell you not to go passed this red line on the ram as it extend out so I did and it almost came apart but I fixed it put it back to gather but still leaks oil.but its an great tool
B002RVK654|4|I can get this for $4 or $5 at my local Autozone.  Road salt always eats up my muffler and exhaust, and I've had very good results using this stuff, even covering up some pretty big holes.  Fit your first piece around the muffler so that you have a few inches overlap; cut your remaining pieces from this first piece.  The instructions tell you to dip the bandages in the liquid... this will NEVER happen (too thick).  I get a big piece of cardboard, lay the bandages down one at a time just before I'm ready to put each on, and paint the liquid on both sides.  You don't need a ton, just enough to get the bandage thoroughly wet.  When I do it like this, I usually have extra liquid activator left over.  I try to have at least 3-4 layers over the holes before I'm done.  Cut the ends off the tube, and you have a nice metal patch to lay down over big holes before you begin bandaging.  I let the engine run to get the exhaust really hot, then let the car sit overnight to let the bandages harden.  Repair jobs usually last around 6 months; I've had some last longer, but anything over 6 months I consider bonus time.  I've never failed emissions inspection using these kits.  Depending on how holey my muffler is, sometimes I've needed two kits, but $5-$10 for six months of a quiet muffler and avoiding hundreds in mechanic bills?  Sign me up!
B00A7WIVNE|5|The part work and fit like a glove no problems what so ever would highly recommend it for anybody that is afraid of cutting their dash or pillars there was no modifications. Where the switches go for the cut out I highly recommend using a Dremel tool the switches worked great. I have a 2013 Wrangler Saharah.4 door.
B007P14NPU|5|Hook this thing up to your car and turn on smart phone gps and Bluetooth and connect.  It gives reading....same as an expensive reader a friend bought from the Matco tool man.
B001GH1OPG|3|hard to install
B00STXAXJ8|5|They fit perfectly in my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee! :) Cheapest price I could find!
B00MR3LGTC|1|This item was received on time and well packed...it worked for about 30 minutes. I did an autopsy to determine cause of death and found that there was not a strain relief on the two wire power cable so that every movement of the wires was felt by the armature wire where it entered the body of the winding. May have been a one-off failure...probably not, in my estimation. So, $46 divided by 30 minutes = a buck and a half per minute. Nah.
B004AYZB38|3|Did not feel any difference using this product
B001FCB4JS|4|All banged up and deformed, but it sticks and it works and the price was OK
B00B8YJFVW|5|Great Price for the quality of the product.  It has worked fine for me, I have been good about not taking it through drive thru car washes like the directions said.  However, it hasn't shown any sign of blowing off so the double sided tape for this product is strong.  I am impressed at how good it looks, and how durable the product is.
B005C57QXC|5|Well worth the $$$. Make my Yamaha Roadliner 1900 look even better.  Great addition to the overall look of the bike.
B00FPJKO66|5|100% A+<br />I sent in my Order for this product and I installed it the day I got it in the Mail, I have to say I have ben looking for something like this for a long time and I am as of right now very Happy with this Item.<br /><br />I had a Friend come by the House the day after I got it so I took him out to let him see what he thought about it and he ask me what it was and how did it work, So after showing him he said he had to have one for his Cars, So I told him where to Order it at.<br /><br />If you try it I do not think you will Return it after you get use to using it, You may even buy another for all your other Cars and you may just put one in for the Passenger as I am going to do.
B000GTZB68|5|Due to toe amputations it hurt to shift gears. Now I am back riding.
B00VKX7NJC|5|Fit like a charm.  Thanks!!
B000LG27TK|4|Put this exhaust on my 2010 Nissan Titan CC nice looking exhaust and a nice tone to it but if you are looking for something that people will hear you coming from a mile away keep looking this is not it. It added a mellow tone to the truck and coupled with my AEM intake I think it sounds very nice but then again I didn't really want a exhaust that rattled all the windows in the neighborhood or that I had to wear ear plugs while driving down the interstate. Install was pretty straight forward as long as you have enough PB blast or WD-40 to get the old exhaust off with. It does not include new nuts for the exhaust flanges after the cats so beware not to damage them or the studs if possible mine were nice and stuck but with soaking them in PB Blast over night and a good breaker bar I was able to salvage them without damage. All in all I did the install laying on my back and took me 4hrs which most of that was getting the old off.
B000KBZMT8|5|Nice for toting around my rain suit, but not much more.  Has a nice rubber texture on the bottom and bungee hooks.
B009MAKDQU|5|I haven't even received it but it looks like it will be very nice and sturdy. I like to be a good testimony without plastering a bunch of bumper stickers on my car.
B000GTWMAG|5|Fit great, got 1 ride on it and no complaints.
B00A82CB3O|5|the batteries have worked out great for us and will recommend to any one looking for a replacement battery for their Silent Pro tennis ball machine
B000GKIDQ2|4|If you own a Triumph motorcycle don't leave home without one tucked away for emergency use. Better yet buy a couple and before you leave on a long tour consider replacing ones which look like they're on their last leg.  I own a Triumph Trophy 1200 and the originals were placed upside down inviting corrosion aplenty. That's why I didn't have headlights all of a sudden.  Why do I suggest you replace at home before you go?  Who wants to disassemble a faring on the road just to get to the relays!!  Cheap insurance my friends.
B00E6F2S1E|5|Even better than I thought... the color is super Orange! Which is what I wanted..purchased for husband. He's happy with it..put it on an ammo can! Lol
B003TSOYZW|5|I bought this socket some time ago only recently needed to use it to pull the hubs on my Tundra.  Fit perfectly and worked great with hand tools, air and electric impact wrenches.
B005DX6BRK|5|These lights are are simply the best, I have had these on a 2005 Ford Freestyle for close to two years now. They have been thru the extreme Michigan weather and are a great value for your money. Installation was simple and easy as well.<br /><br />** Update - April 17th 2015<br /><br />It's close to 3 years now since the installation, these lights are simply awesome. The brackets have started to rust, I will clean those out as soon as we get some warm days here.
B00064P99W|1|I'd installed the Accel 8140 SuperStock yellow coil as an upgrade and preventive maintenance for the 30-year-old original coil my car was running.  Only 5 months later, my car died in stop'n'go traffic on a hot Tucson summer day and would not restart.  Funny thing in retrospect was that spark was one of the first things I tested and confirmed good at the scene of the stall, so I that led me to suspect a fuel issue, maybe the carb was either flooding or vaporlocked or something, so just needed to wait that out and let things cool down.<br /><br />Finally got the car running again only to have it die a few blocks later, so upon getting the car towed home, and after going over the carb and fuel pump and everything else I could think of to explain the ongoing lack of startage, I finally tried re-checking the spark again.  This time, nothing.  Put an ohmmeter to the coil and found infinite resistance between the primary and secondary, confirming a dead coil.  Apparently my initial spark test at the scene of the stall was just a fluke or last-gasp, not uncommon for a failing coil.  Put the 30-year-old original coil back in the car, fired right up.<br /><br />I brought up this experience on a forum for my car model, and found out others have had similar issues with this exact coil, and one said this report was the final straw convincing him to remove the Accel coil he was still using on one of his cars despite their failure in two of his other cars.<br /><br />Warranty claim?  Nope, they only offer a 90-day warranty, so this failure was 2 months out of warranty.  Guess I should be glad this happened in town, instead of out on the highway and out of state on the roadtrip I'd planned to start the very next day! :^o
B004AJFDYK|2|This mounts with 2 sided tape to your winch tray. It's not something thats going to stay on very long in the weather or the car wash. It is a nice piece of stainless steel but needs a better mounting solution.
B000CD8HZA|5|This fit perfectly on my 2004 VW R32.  Rubber quality is good, construction seems solid.  Very pleased with the cost versus buying from a local dealer.
B00FBKUUUY|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00BFF2YUS|1|Falling apart. The whole thing broke in to pieces within 3 weeks after loosing spring power a week after it arrived.
B00F47Z2J8|4|Easy installation, nice but unnecessary package. Good quality wire...
B007CM2J3U|5|Great cross bars. Fit perfectly on our 2012 Passat wagon. Drove 6 hours with two adult bikes and one kid bike attached with no problems. No rattling or other noises. Great price!!
B001763SRI|4|The were too small for me, but it was my fault for not measuring before buying. Make sure you get the right size.
B005ML1S4E|5|Exactly what I want to buy I am happy I love transformers I definitely recommend it please add more tings
B00BCH4PLA|5|Great
B00C1CLYJG|5|Xlnt product with fast delivery.  This will keep your Cat Converters from being cut off your Toyota trucks!!
B00DQJ8G6C|3|After 5 months, my antenna is fading. It almost looks gold now.  :(
B00BJCN8H0|5|These pads are excellent! They are oversized which helps the hands not cramp while applying the wax. The only downside was that it was slightly difficult to get the wax out of the Checmical Guys Premium wax can because of the size. Nothing that couldn't be managed though.
B007FI1JMI|5|This one got here fast, the package was still warm. What a deal! It would be impossible, to find such a awesome deal around here, not even for used stuff. First I thought it didn't work, well I need glasses. Worked like a charm, has fittings for R410 units and R134. So you can maintain the home, car and yourself cool. Way cool. What a deal. Thank you MEAGA, thank you Amazon!
B000BZG5OO|4|Thought i needed downstream, cause I'm a amateur mechanic. But after going to my local auto parts store that wanted 60$ for the same part, I realized it worked for either... So this is in my upstream now and my check engine light went off...
B008BLFSWA|5|Have'nt had to use yet , but it is reasurring knowing Its there like a spare tire. Will purchase some more for around house when power goes out at gas stations. Really great product.
B003MY1EEC|5|Sweet frame! had an eliminator kit (not sure which one, previous owner) on my 04 R6 and the guy before me never did a proper light setup for the license plate (bulb was dangling over it) found this frame and the price was right, did not take more than an hour to solder and connect the new frame. looks great and fit well, and the lights are bright enough to see plate. And the frame is solid too, did not feel flimsy and came with black bolts as well.<br /><br />-only advice is make sure you check which wire is positive and negative on your bike, polarity matters for LEDs. And I had to grind a little notch in my license plate to give the wires more clearance so they would not rub and short out eventually.
B00WVNHLGK|1|Cheap metal too thin to weld and the clamp together design that's on it won't hold it together
B00EQMLDOK|5|Great customer service.  I had an issue with rotor rust. Didn't realize these rotors were not zinc coated.  Callahan sent out replacements for me. Rotors installed with no issue.  Great braking performance. I will be doing business with them again.
B000EQPBSG|5|Item received as described and at a fraction of Retail Prices!
B00480J4UK|4|as the title says, not much of an improvement over original bulb.  and the color seems to be very close to the original incandescent bulb's color..I mean it doesnt seem too white or bluish at all.
B004W9ABC2|5|What can I say TOYOTA Amazing.....
B00A6AS6LY|5|This is an amazing tool. I do not know how I have worked on cars without this tool.
B00C7Z0QAK|5|Just what I needed.
B003YMRO1Y|1|I like ACDelco parts but this rotor does not fit a 2000 Toyota Sienna.
B00KV7FMNC|3|Its ok. If I had to buy it again I wouldn't.<br />Was'nt the right size for me.
B001NYFOLC|5|This kit has everything you need. The timing belt is high quality, looks stronger than OEM. It is holding on my 300hp Honda with no signs of wear (about 5k miles)
B00425N24K|5|Great fit.  Very visible.
B00A0GN0LK|5|Very good
B001P2X4EQ|4|Good and sturdy. I will have to get a longer bolt for my polaris hitch, the one they sent only threds half the nut. The flat plate, opposite the hook, will wear the paint if ruggedly used. There is probably no way to prevent this so I recomend a coat of axle grease to prevent rust. Great product that meets expectations.
B0053ZE23I|5|It looks great on the back of the vehicle.
B000CQ47KQ|2|I purchased a set of these for my 2008 Toyota Tacoma. The 21\\" passenger side wiper works great but the 22\\" driver's side misses about 4\\" of the upper windshield at the end of the wiper's stroke.  It's a pick-up truck.  The glass is almost flat with just a slight curve but the wiper can't handle it.  It's a premium product but can't do what it was intended to do.  These aren't the wipers you're looking for.  You can go about your business.
B005OFJKNO|5|good fit
B00KTJ9WHY|5|ordered this to replace my car remote took it to get programed and only one took the programe now im stucked with a defective remote
B000E81VN8|5|This trunk organizer is well made and well designed.  I expect to get many years use out of it.  It easily collapses flat, so there is no need to completely remove it when full trunk space is needed.
B0033QQ4S0|4|Premixed and ready to go. Only used half, its mixing with the old green well and working as intended.
B009PNQ9HG|5|American football deserves respect, so why not put a quality Texans logo on your vehicle to prove it.<br />The best part about this emblem is that it is NOT the dallas cowboys on your car.
B000EPXX0K|1|Installed on my 400e and 1 side was rubbing on the caliper. Had to buy more expensive parts from mechanic to get job done on time.<br /><br />As always amazin customer service was awsome. Refunded right away.
B000KG8KB0|4|This product works as advertise. I tried it right out of the box on my wife 2003 impala and was able to retrieve a 02 sensor pending code.<br />It lets you read some sensors, including the coolant sensor, and run live diagnostics. You can also monitor your o2 sensors.<br />It's easy to use, and doesn't require advance knowledge.<br />The price is very reasonable too.<br />The built in library of definitions is nice, but you'll find much more info online for your specific code.<br />Window Vista users beware!!! the Actron software is not compatible with vista. You can install it on the computer but you won't be able to update the scanner. I have to update it at work where I use window XP.<br />Something else: the case that comes with the scanner is too big for it. It's not a big deal, but I don't see why Actron can't provide a case that is the right size.
B00J6318IK|5|Nice wide step up better than my factory set
B0013CXCYK|5|This is easily the best bumper protector sold. It's the thickest and strongest, and the steel-reinforced straps should make the straps better able to withstand the constant pounding from the car's trunk or rear hatch/tailgate door. Lastly, it's BY FAR the best-looking, plus it retains its shape because of its thickness and impact pads (the other thinner protectors end up looking wrinkled and flaccid or like a wet noodle). It looks good enough to keep outside the car all the time.
B001PWFPRU|1|Installed, but  after it popped off a few times I took it off. Did not work for me. Returned for a refund.
B00A7ZMH9A|5|Fits my Lexus perfectly.<br />Only more products to enjoy from the Lexus brand.<br />Nice sleek material that will withstand the tests of time.
B00B1TNQCS|5|Works as advertised
B0066CGLS6|5|This tool worked exactly as expected and helped me identify a wiring problem in my vehicle.
B004ZCKOGE|5|This is so adorable.  I support pandas who fight back :)  No seriously, this decal was no problem at all putting on my ipad, and has no signs of peeling
B000KEATFC|5|I have been a fan of MOMO car accessories for years.  As always, this is a great quality product with very good leather material and strong threaded ring to screw onto the shift knob.
B00DCNHEB0|1|Wrong part.
B001LHVOVK|1|Complete junk!!! Does not show the codes at all on a 2002 Ford Ranger. Will only erase codes to clear the CEL. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra 20 bucks for an orange Actron reader; been using one of those for many years with no issues.
B007A2PXXK|5|I had blue jean dye on my white leather sofa and this worked magically. I was able to see the results after letting the remover soak into the leather for around 5 minutes. I then started scrubbing in a circular motion and noticed the dye lifting shortly after. I'm very pleased with this product.
B00B3L2XEQ|5|Measurements were perfect for the item I was placing it on. True to color and easy to apply.
B000M8IHQY|5|USED IN THE PACKING OF MY TRAILER BRARING AND HAD NO PROBLEMS.  USED THESE GREASE WITH THE Lisle 34550 Handy Packer Bearing Packer AND THE PACKER WORKED GREAT. ALSO USES THE GREASE ON MY 5TH WHEEL HITCH PLATE.
B0012ETJ1O|5|The Sylvania Silverstar Ultra Headlight provides the best night time viewing of any headlight I have tried and I have tried quite a few.  It's down the road and side to side illumination are significantly better than any other.  I highly recommend these headlights, especially if you are doing a lot of night driving!! I should say that these are used on my Yamaha R1 motorcycle and I work nights and ride to work alot and I travel on unlit roads.  The life expectancy may be a little short, but I need something that can light up enough of the front so I don't \\"outrun\\" my lights.
B00537FR08|4|Who knew 2 5/16\\" hitch ball covers could be so hard to find? My old hitch ball cover was made of hard rubber 1/8\\" thick, and after 4 1/2 years of use it dried out and split open from the bottom to the top. I thought I could go most anywhere to get a new one, but I was mistaken. I searched and found this cover at a reasonable price on Amazon, when local stores and other online retailers had it for much more (up to $20 more with shipping). This one is more flexible, and hopefully it will last as long as the old cover. The Curt name isn't printed on the cover as in the picture on Amazon, but I'll be happy as long as it doesn't fall apart like the old one. 4 stars, since I'm not sure if it will last.
B000JFJMFK|5|As Described
B008FQH91Y|5|I installed one of these to replace the original factory antenna whose mount was badly damaged when my wife backed up after having accidentally triggered the garage door to lower. Dealer repair would have been VERY expensive. I was surprised to find that reception with the shark fin antenna was approximately the same as with the original antenna (trying them both in turn I could not really tell the difference). The shark fin even conceals the dented part of the car roof, and the whole thing looks great! One thing: the adhesive mounting tape is extremely strong (generally a good thing) so be very careful that the antenna is positioned correctly before allowing the adhesive to touch the car roof. All in all, easy to install, and a wonderful result.
B00832N2OS|5|It worked as expected!
B005LQTC3O|3|Does the job but how it ties into the handle bar (inside the bar) does not hold very well.
B003YAR1BE|3|The small rubber sheathed pins that the recoil pad rests on will eventually rub a groove in your pad, particularly if you drive over rough terrain frequently.  I've remedied this problem with a couple of rectangles of 1/2\\" closed cell foam to support the rifle stocks and get them off those skinny little pins.  Otherwise, I'm very happy with the model 2.
B00700E8QA|5|Great quality and super fast shipping from the great South. This was from stickaroo, they are fantastic. Looks great on my tool/gun box. See my pic...
B005KOZ25Y|1|RIP OFF and JUNK!!!!!!!!!!  My unit broke in less than a year.  The add says two year warranty.  I emailed the seller five times with not one response.  This is absolute JUNK.  YOU ARE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY.  I REPEAT YOU ARE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY.  Buttons are hard to press and when it was working it was okay.  I could tell that it would not hold up to any wear or tear.  I kept the unit in a dry place and after the third use it light up and just plain failed.  I opted to get a USB based on that I could work with my phone.  So far that one is fine and serves the emergency use that I require (probably once a year).  And did I mention that Autel US will tell you they will not help you.
B003ITFAPK|5|I put this on my Honda SH 150 and it works like it is supposed to. It will save me money in the long run instead of buying a new air filter each time regular maintenance is needed. The performance improvement is not HUGE, but it is noticeable if you've known your bike for a long time to notice any changes.
B00684TGWA|1|There was no problem at all with the shipping but when I got the device it didn't work. I've synced multiple key fobs to my Nissan and this is the only one that didn't work. I tried changing the battery and it was still a no go.
B00PBEN5PW|3|It was nice but the floor mats were stapled together with these like industrial sized staples and left little holes and then the back seat was too big but it is worh the price
B001QFDW3U|5|Easy install, works great
B000WJ946A|4|The nuts that were provided vibrated themselves loose and fell off after a week.
B000CIR1QG|4|It would be easier to install if they left it up to the installer to apply the sealer.  I used some liquid Teflon based sealer, but their<br />solid pre-installed sealer was blocking the threads.  Otherwise, it is a very well made part.  If your vehicle is very old, plan on the original one snapping off when you try to remove it.  I had to cut the old threads out and use a tap to clean out the threads.
B00L2QM806|5|Very handy for blocking out the sun for my newborn. Great product!
B003XPOBW2|2|Bought the digital unit for a more accurate readout but it was .2V off when compared to my multimeter. Quite a bit when troubleshooting at battery condition. The 10 sec. auto load feature seemed to work as designed. Sent back to exchange for another. Will see.
B004GFS2C8|4|I purchased this after getting a chip in my window from a rock. Unfortunatly, the crack spidered out before I received the product thus making it useless. I tried using it to hold me over til I could afford another windshield ($650) and it did seal the initial rock chip keeping it from spreading. I would recommend buying this and keeping it around in case it happens to you, if you can catch it right away, this stuff is the ticket.
B000JUXGAC|5|awesome product.  have it installed on an Atomic-4 engine.  So very happy.
B000SZPN2C|5|By far the best I've used for the holding tank in my boat.  It's not watery and thin like so many other products, so it really does the job it should.  It may be a little more expensive, but you can actually use less of it than you might need to with other less expensive products.  I make a point to order this every year when boating season arrives.
B00068XCQU|5|Excellent Product.  Performs as advertised.  I've used a Battery Tender Plus for 5+ years on one of my cars and never had a problem.  Now I've purchased for my friends and family.
B0008F67JU|5|Keeps my hitch ball super lubed!
B005SNMQJ2|3|Protects well.  Kind of hard to get air bubbles out from underneath it since you can see right through it.  Sticks really well.
B000X25JRO|4|This mat fit my 2013 Prius just right, it does seem all rolled up coming out of the packaging but it flattens out nice and fits snugly
B000E4HK0K|5|Great Value. This product was on-time, fit perfect, and installed easily. It was a perfect replacement part at a great price. The service was excellent as the product was delivered in just a few days, faster than promised. Looks great.
B0051D3MP6|5|Keeps my dual sport battery charged when I don't get a chance to ride it often enough.
B001G6MLZY|5|NPN AND THE OEM TOYOTA OIL FILTERS ARE THE SAME.  IN FACT NPN MAKES SOME OF THE OEM TOYOTA FILTERS.  THEY ALSO MAKE HONDA OEM FILTERS FOR HONDA.  YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THESE AND THEY ARE MUCH CHEAPER...
B003U7REDG|5|great
B005D1HS8I|4|Very cute!  It shows up very well and looks very nice on my white SUV, I really like it.  I have suggested to many of my Schnauzer and dog buds.
B008PLX89Q|1|Had to return for a refund because I was sent a large instead of a small. So I cannot comment of functionality.
B000AY8968|5|The product came extremely quickly and was exactly what was pictured/described! Great seller and product, highly recommended!
B001AZH6H4|5|Have been using them for several months now and they have worked good,  Sturdy, handy and they can hold very heavy bags without any difficulty.
B003RAGWMA|5|worked flawlessly on my 1997 Avalon ....came with programming instructions and all....took 3 min.  works like a charm!
B00GXXCP2Y|5|Easy Install, Loud, and cheaper than a BOV
B009PQGKK4|5|It's brake fluid.  It works.
B0002HLYAQ|5|Great
B004GCXB9K|5|Exactly what I needed. Exact fit for the one I had damaged
B00DN7QQ1O|4|This is a very neat lighter to have. The pick and tamper piece is a little short, but It has a smooth functioning ignition button which makes it easy to use. It does not come filled though, so have your butane ready before hand!
B000C1KDE0|2|Feel like i got Scammed not the item pictured there description is  poor and leads you to infer that it is the whole assembly, you can get it cheaper at [...], $158.00.
B003YNF9CO|5|Fit just right and nice hook up.. Very pleased..
B001EP0GU4|5|This product is great and I got it for a great price.  Installation on my 2010 Ford Escape Hybrid went very smooth without drilling any extra holes.  Product is clean looking and was exactly what I was looking for.
B003CJHPHW|5|Its a top quality bandana. The material is great, and the printing on it, is also excellent.
B000BZL08U|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B012XIP074|5|I installed these in the center high mount stop lamp and licence plate lights on my 05 Town and Country. I wouldn't say they're any brighter than incandescent bulbs. They do produce a nice clean white light and that's important. I'm also hoping they last longer. It's only ba couple weeks but I'm happy with them so far.
B004WKH14M|5|The break in oils are well suited to flat tapet engines during the initial running in period. If you follow the cam grinders recomdations as to break-in you can not go wrong with Brad Penn.
B00651CLCS|5|This is super cute on my 2013 jeep sahara. with the shorted antenna my radio stations did not change. Best of all no more antenna hitting windshield in the car wash :)
B005HTFQI0|5|I thought that I would try a Modular Helmet but I have heard Mixed reviews (Noise, Sizing, Fumbling around, etc). When I received the helmet, it fit great, It is easy to operate and noise is a bit on the higher side than a Full one Piece helmet, but that is to be expected for a Modular.<br /> I really like this helmet and very impressed with just how nice it feels and the multiple uses, the Sun Visor is a big plus.
B000M5Y72A|3|I thought these were really going to brighten my nights while driving my Nissan Frontier, but I don't really notice much difference than the OEM bulbs.  Easy to install though.
B0053SKJAK|5|We needed these for a restaurant that uses them on lobsters tank. solid construction and ease of use.Handles the day to day pressure from workers that are busy.
B00B4KTI5I|4|Just installed this regulator and motor, so I cannot comment on durability over time, but being an ACDelco part, I am sure it will last.  The motor is probably two to three times as loud as the OEM motor, so this product lost a star.
B000F6F99G|3|the lasers can not be pointed wide enough to allow both cars laser dots to be even to the middle of the car dash. Otherwise ok device.
B0016J5BIA|5|It says that the CX508 Monroe pads do not fit my 2001 Oldsmobile Aurora but they do. I suggest before you buy or do not buy parts on Amazon to use sites such as Rockauto and use a more accurate look up to confirm fitment. It also said 6 lug brake rotors fit my 2500 Avalanche which is 8 lug set up. But the pads themselves are great. Very low dust and no noise and stop great. What more can you want ?
B00FADDOL4|4|I receive my flasher last week, I programmed it and then installed it, just follow the steps.  It was simpler than it looked. I really love the braking warnings  that displays to other drivers. I strongly recommend this product for those who are concerned about being rear-ended.
B000EDOT8C|5|Very useful, excellent cutting surface.
B002XYT2HI|5|If you own ford uplander, you can install these like i did and simply cut off the old connector and splice these new ones right onto the old cable.  the cables are very long and otherwise require you to get really greasy under the motor.  the connector is typically what fails anyways.  My UBS fault is now gone as i also replaced the hubs.
B00CAY8LO6|3|Although this product does what it was designed to do (hide the servo connector) and looks good on my 2013 CVO Anniversary Road Glide, I feel it should be a little more rigid.  With just a slight increase in the thickness of the metal, it would be less prone to vibration.  My concern is the possibility of snapping this by accident while cleaning; it's that thin.
B009G5ERVS|5|Works great and shipping was extremely fast.
B000E7SY0C|4|Overall the rack if very good. Well designed and manufactured. No sharp edges, everything works smooth.<br />Conc: it comes with hitch connector bolt. The hole in hitch connector works only with that bolt - I cannot use a hitch lock to secure the rack from a stealing. Also if you don't tight that hitch bolt the rack can wiggle.
B000CM5C5Y|4|Works as stated, just wouldn't stay adhered, problem solved with Gorilla Glue. I still recommend.
B008QBUDZM|5|Adorable and well made.
B002PNOKKQ|4|shipping wasn't what I expected slow on delivery hooked up perfectly on my cheap wench only the switch is backwards now but not a big deal
B007VFKH32|4|Great products, fits well.
B002D3KR4Q|5|The process and the bumper guard were both great.
B004A2IFII|5|A very good purchase less then half if purchased from auto dealer and they are the exact same thing.
B006297FGU|5|Very well made !
B00E1ETJNU|4|This frame is great for the particular application that I needed which was low key.
B002SINBRQ|5|:) satisfied with my purchase
B004VGAJOG|5|very good product
B00AZLZ900|3|Product was decent and the welds were ok not the best but will hold for a good while.... The only things keeping me from rating at 5 stars were the gaskets it comes with as well as the overall craftsmanship of the piece.. Overall would recommend
B000QMFGBA|5|fit my trailer spare tire perfectly!
B001261IEI|5|My son had these on his trailer.  I put a set on all of my trailers.  They were super easy to install and then just fill them with grease and you're done.
B0013ERRSK|5|No more messy floor in our camper.  When using regular bowls, they always get bumped and spill - not this thing.
B0015RRFAA|5|After reviewing several brands of brake rotors, the Raybestos received good reviews, plus Raybestos has been around a long time with quality products. So I bought a set of four for my Expedition to replace the original rotors as at least one was warped and causing the brakes to grab during low speed stops. It was not bad, but I just did not like the grabbing when stopping. Rotors can be turned of course, but if warped out of shape due to over heating or just age, It may be cheaper to just replace them, if you do the work your self. Which I did. Plus it is not uncommon to have rotors turned only to have the same problem return, now you are out the money for the turning, plus buying new rotors anyway.<br /><br />When replacing rotors on these newer cars, the runout must be checked and corrected if needed. A dial indicator must be used and the runout be no more than.002 inch. I was able to rotate the rotors one hole at a time and obtain a .001 left side, .002 right side runout with out using rotor correction shims. A clean surface on both the hub and rotor is required.<br />Also be sure to mark the stud and rotor with white paint so if the rotor is removed, you can put it back in the same position. The result was that my brakes work just fine now.<br /><br />The Raybestos rotors are thicker than many of the cheaper replacement rotors, so they are less prone to cracking and warping. If you are going to spend money on new rotors anyway, might as well get the better replacement. The only down side to the Raybestos rotors, and it not really a down side I guess, but I kind of wish I just opened the box without looking at it first, Yep, made in China, but I think everything is made in China now. Anyway, my brakes work just fine now.
B005FKT72M|5|Brakes were easy to install, and they really perform better than expected. I plan on installing these brand of brakes on all my cars from now on.
B000GU5PCC|4|These slips work well to protect the nudo floor of my enclosed trailer.Just be careful,because steering is non-existent when they are attached to  the skis.You will need to be lined up straight when loading/unloading snowmobile.Sometimes ,the sled wants to go a bit sideways when loading or unloading.A little persuasion on my part is needed to keep them 'in line', if you will.
B00IAIGEXQ|5|it was great too, just not enough of it
B00BZOKQVS|5|Just what i imagined! Completes my Hello Kitty themed car!<br /><br />I only wish the stick shift cover was a bit tighter.
B0006305RY|4|This is a great product at a great price
B0081S4DCE|5|Arrived on time and was well packaged. Very good instructions and a good quality genuine Subaru accessory. Very easy to put on the car and it fits perfectly. The final result looks very good and it protects the hood very well preventing further stone chips.
B0018MITR0|5|Great product
B000TYL7KY|5|Good stuff
B001KS4OT4|1|This starter has the V6 engine solenoid instead of the correct 4 cyl. version. This will require adjustments to the factory starter cable and the signal wire. This could lead to wire chaffing problems. Since the intake manifold will have to be removed to access the starter, adjusting the harness will be difficult once the intake is back in place. The box the starter came packed in is marked as: V6 engine. It should be advertised the same way.
B004HV8G04|4|no directions, but fairly easy to figure out, had to poke holes to put the fabric to put the head rest back in.
B00907C9JO|5|The mat is fine.
B0019F5D9S|5|Awesome emblem.  Solid and very well built.
B00S68U8FU|5|Work good.
B00PMCN91S|5|Good quality. Fast Transaction
B001HLIMD8|4|These are as advertised. Soft and cushiony. I am using them for shoulder pads for my backpack, but they would be good for seatbelt covers too. The only downside (and therefore 4 not 5 stars) is that the hook and loop is stiff and could be stronger. I trimmed the pointy corners and have to clean the loops, but the softness and functionality makes it a good product...and it is genuine sheepskin, not synthetic!!
B004ULDW28|5|Great place to purchase hubcaps from! They came so fast and they were exactly what I needed. Toyota corolla hubcaps of the 2007 model are always falling off, so I decided to get rid of them all and put these 4 on and they are simply amazing! No regrets!
B006L7Q43S|5|Quality product. arrived as described.
B000BZI4JI|5|Fits as described.  Improved performance. My truck has over 200,000 miles...i don't think these were ever changed and now I notice a considerable power difference.
B006A1PGDE|5|Great gift for Christmas. works great!
B000NKAZAM|5|Having owned many K & N Filters, I was only in need of a different size for my application.  '69 Z/28 with cowl induction air cleaner)  K & N offers one of the best reusable filters and I have used them for years.  (I replaced a 3\\" tall filter with a 4\\")  They have become a little \\"pricy\\", but remains a good product that should not ever need replacing.  The performance advantage of using these filters is only as much as you believe in the articles in the car magazines, nothing you can feel, but makes a positive statement about your old performance, muscle car when the hood is up and the engine is displayed.  I search for any product on Amazon.com before I buy.  I have been very satisfied with pricing and delivery..
B0002ZG3MW|5|just what I ordered thanks
B005CLMEHE|5|It did the job!!! I'm really enjoying the handle it was a really good fit!! I recommend it to anyone
B000JU1F1E|3|It's okay but quaility is not as good as years back. I purchased two of these from two different vendors, one I was able to order the color I wanted and the other was whatever they sent. Needless to say I was very disappointed that I did not receive the color I had ordered on the one.
B0086C16NE|1|Malfunctioned the day after it was professionally installed. Could have been the mech, I don't know.
B00SX1QG9C|5|Fit perfectly... yamaha star venture 99-?...
B007RHX1DC|5|One of my old locks was damaged (plastic part cracked) so I decided to replace both…  exact fit, exact same part:)
B00B9Q63IW|5|I used these as rear turn signals on my gsxr750.  The previous owner had cut out the fender and had no signals.  I installed some integrated light wiring and passed inspections for years, but finally in 2013 I failed inspection for not having separate signals.  These were the perfect fix.  The 3m adhesive is ridiculously strong.  I used an alcohol cleaner to clean my passenger peg bracket, and once stuck they are really on there, I thought removing them would break them.  They have a rubbery exterior which seems pretty waterproof, and would allow you to bend it into shapes.  The wires are very narrow, difficult to connect to my bikes wiring but it all worked.<br /><br />They are really bright.  You can see them from far away even with daylight hitting them.  The inspection guy was across the yard when I pulled in and he commented on how bright they were, then gave me my sticker!<br /><br />One note, they take very little power, so little that my bike's signal relay thought they weren't there.  when the load drops below a certain threshold, it thinks a light has gone out, and blinks twice as fast to warn you to replace that light.  So with these new blinkers, or any low power led signals, you will have quickly blinking lights, I've heard it called hyper-flashing.  I recommend getting a different signal relay that has a lower threshold or no threshold.  They are available for most bikes, and are a better solution than using inline devices to draw the missing power.
B00D8RYGOI|5|I was really impressed for the price. I would highly recommend this product. Looks really nice on my sxs.
B0050SG9KW|4|I just bought this gauge and have used it a bit as well as tested it against another gauge. It's solidly built and has the basic components you'll need to do some vacuum measurements. My only gripe is that the needle is resting at 1 in of pressure. So you have to subtract 1 inch from all pressure readings and add 1 inch to any vacuum readings. I haven't decided whether to exchange it yet since I can live with that problem. The needle is just calibrated a bit high and it stays consistently that way. But otherwise it's a great gauge for the money.
B000GANZZ6|5|Easy to install, works great, fast response<br />I put this in my camper 8 months ago and it is working fine.
B005CLN66C|5|Perfect fit for my car
B0038IAMCW|5|Battery fit my BMW K1200LT just fine, and cost less than an original battery. I did take the adapter from the old positive post to make easier connection in a tight spot. Sorry I can't comment on how well it (will) perform and how long it will last, because at this review time, I have only had it about a month.
B000BPTVTK|4|In high speed ( over 40 - 45 ml) it works as described. But driving in town whit lower speed, it makes even worst. I do not complain much, but my wife.
B0012AURLE|5|I purcahsed this to add braking connection to my work truck for a new 10,000# trailer. It has performed well, was easy to install, and is durable (except when my truck slid back-first down a steep hill and was stopped by the hitch & socket!)  I used a very generous amount of electrical contact jelly on the wiring connections, as well as sealing the wiring entrance with silicone caulk, all because of the very corrosive snow melt used here in Western PA winters. I doubt that you would find a better socket at 3 x the price.
B00E756AQC|5|I recently ordered these from an ebay seller and they are awesome. They look so good. Worth the struggle of putting them in.
B0031BORHW|3|good price, however the picture is misleading. This is NOT the kit you will receive. I ordered this for a friend who sent me the link. He did not want an amazon account, so I ordered it for him. We found that it was the kit that kept the oem wiring and connections. Still great parts, Cycle Electric is the best there is. Just know what you are ordering, and never trust the pictures.
B00GN0V8W0|5|Haven't tried it yet but it looks good.
B000C53Q4U|5|I had replaced my 96 Buick struts only, the end result was upsetting.  Had a clunking sound on bumps. I bought the Monroe 171822 Quick Strut Assembly, which I installed in a quarter of the time. What a great ride I'm getting now. I will never replace only the struts again. By the time you buy the bearings, bellows, ect, you'll have allmost the cost of a complete assembly. Not to mention the danger and work involved in compressing the spring to chang only the strut.  Do yourself a favor and but the quick strut assemly.
B00EANHCNQ|5|Great color and material
B0061J6CQU|4|Everything went great the mounts were slightly different than stock but all in all fit pretty good! Love the look!
B000FPYW4K|5|Worked well was a little tricky to figure out how it is supposed to be used but after messing with it for a couple of minutes I was able to see what the tool designer had in mind and at that point it worked well.
B00APVFGQM|1|The product itself was great,  albeit not the product I ordered.  It was advertised as one left in stock, but when I paid for it,  I was advised they had discontinued the product and they'll send me the latest version instead.  In fairness the seller did offer to let me return it free of charge if I was unhappy with the product.<br /><br />Lastly,  it wasn't clear that I would be charged an import tax.  I bought the jacket because it was good value,  however by the time I received it, I had a last minute charge applied at custom which resulted in me paying more than if I had purchased it in the UK.  I didn't have a choice but to pay it and subsequently, I couldn't return it either as I would have been charged again.<br /><br />I did supply this feedback to the seller but have not received any response.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't buy through Amazon.com again and I would hope Amazon take this on board and make it more visable about the potential charges that overseas customers may have to pay (not in the small print at the bottom of the page!)
B000BQWMFO|5|As expected. Great shine. Easy to use.
B00II99ORU|5|Love these so far.. A little more yellow than a standard buld, but they look nice and last.
B00IDG6Q0Q|5|These are very nicely made and bright. Great price I will be ordering more
B006RQ44BM|5|After much hand wringing and reading reviews all over, I decided to give this a whirl on my 2007 Jeep Commander with the 3.7L V6, a Rough Country 2&#34; lift/level kit, 17x8 Pro Comp 7105s with Goodyear Duratracs in 265/70/17s.  Mostly wanted it to recalibrate the speedo, and make sure everything was good to go with the bigger tires.  A little performance boost certainly was welcome for this pig as well!<br /><br />The 1st programmer I received had been used by somebody else, which LOCKS the programmer on to their VIN - Hypertech makes it so you can only program these on 1 vehicle (for obvious reasons)... pretty frustrating to get all excited then get a &#34;vehicle mismatch&#34; code on the damn box you just spent $300 bucks on, then have to wait 4 more days for a new one!  After my frustration ceased and I waited for Amazon to deliver another one (which their return/replace program did promptly, even before I had sent the old one back) I loaded up the new programmer on my computer, installed the correct tune, and loaded it on to my vehicle.  Install was a breeze, in my haste I did forget to unplug my phone charger, so I deleted the tune, returned it to stock and reloaded it.  Don't know how much of a difference that really makes, but just for safety's sake I did it.  Took it for a spin around the neighborhood, and it may just be me, but it does seem to have a bit more scoot to it.  I didn't adjust shift points or anything but it also seemed a bit smoother that way too.  I'll update with MPG gains and perceived performance improvements over time.<br /><br />To the guy who sent the tuner back after programming his car (last 4 of your VIN is 0639) I sorely hope you did not leave this tune on  and send it back, as you may run in to problems later if you take your car in to get a tune up at a shop.  You may regret it, since you now can't return your car to the stock tune first...<br /><br />All in all, kudos to Amazon once again for great customer service, kudos to Hypertech, and a big thumbs down to the cheater.
B004BYVIGG|1|Well, according to the amazon bar this suspension should have matched my car, but when I opened it up, it didn't!!! I contacted the seller about returning it and they said I have to pay almost $50 to return it cause they don't have the one for my car so they don't know how I ordered it. (Great response) So just know that if you make the same mistake it'll cost you $50 to ship back
B000FQ25WK|5|This was a perfect replacement for the cracked and broken seal on my 1983 Jeep CJ7 Renegade.  The install was faily simple as well
B002SSEXJG|5|Other than testing the installation I haven't used this water heater but it did get plenty hot when I tested it.  I got this model since it is an exact replacement in my Coleman tent trailer.  Installation wasn't too tough other than one corner of the flange was a little bent.  I tried to spend a little time cleaning the old sealer off hoping the new sealers will stick better.  I put Butyl sealer around part if the flange (door) and silicone where it mates to the trailer so hopefully it will keep water out.  I also installed a homemade bypass for when I winterize it.
B008BYQQO6|5|I really like this. After ordering it, I was concerned I may have order one too short for me. This one is perfect for a someone my height (5'8&#34;)
B000QUXX1W|4|Worked well as it should have.<br />shipping was fast<br />produced the amount of heat that it should<br />easy installation.<br />would recommend to a friend
B00GZBWBOQ|5|Great mirrors I would recommend to any one
B001UOYNK8|2|I bought an used car with a beyond strong smoke smell. I tried everything in the book, after weeks of frustration, my friend sprayed my car front seats, back seats and trunk with &#34;Car Smell&#34; from chemicalguys.com. The smell disappeared instantaneously. I could not believe it was so fast and easy. I don't know why I could not find it earlier, it could have saved me from weeks of allergic reactions and hair and clothing smelling like tobacco. Please share the word. I hope amazon will offer this product soon.
B004JC19RI|5|I bought this as a gift for my son for his birthday. He's a HUGE Firefly fan and this was one of his favorite gifts.
B003A6GY38|4|These grips came exactly as described. They were a nice replacement for my old warn out grips and I actually like them better than the stock grips that came on the bike. If I dumped the bike and ruined these I would likely buy them again. Good price too.
B003F1M3Q0|2|Its HUGE. I guess it would be nice on like a 60inc TV, but for my 23 inch monitor it was unusable. Good price is why it gets a star.
B002G0XGIA|3|The pipes sound great. The only issue I have is that the pipes do not look straight at the back of the truck.
B001BAYEWS|4|Perfect fit for 2002 e39 5 series.
B008GNG5LG|5|I was very pleased with this product, the price was amazing!
B00KIS8G8M|5|They really make my new chrome wheels pop. Well worth the money.
B0093RRSXS|5|Purchased for my 05 g35 coupe and they worked absolutely perfect, great price, great quality
B000LMT8F0|2|First off, the box came faster than I expected, by FedEx. Nice. The bags are very nice looking, but they're not meant for a full size motorcycle. The span is too small, even after I adjusted it out as far as it would go. When I held one bag up to my bike where it should sit, the turn signals were in the way and the bag sat on the exhaust.    When I searched for saddlebags, I specifically searched for ones to fit a 1984 Kawasaki KZ550F LTD. These were supposed to fit, but there's no way on God's green Earth to fit them without taking a knife to them. I believe they might fit a very narrow bike, like a dirt bike, but not a cruiser like mine.    When I complained to the company and asked them to pay for shipping them back, they replied with this:    I would suggest you to send the item back using our return instructions. Please click the below link to review our return policy :  [...]    Please note we will cover the return shipping charge, if the item delivered damaged or has any other manufacturer defects.    I think a product that does not fit as it is claimed to is defective, but I know I've just been taken for almost $80. I'd sooner craigslist them than deal with this again.
B008WXL0UQ|5|I love this.  My fiancee and I each have one ASD child and one neurotypical child.  We love them all and this is subtle and different from a lot of the decals out there.  He, though, is neurotic and had to alter the detached puzzle piece because it doesn't match with the outline of the heart. LOL
B000C2CAF4|5|Parts stores here don't have them stocked, I hate driving around looking for a gasket. Here they let you get one per week. So it was just easier to buy 10 at a time and have them on hand.
B00GJHHVQY|5|Good product, fast delivery.
B00AJ69V64|5|I installed it . No problem .saved a great amount of money by ordering thru amazon
B004475PQY|5|Works perfectly.  Holds small items from rolling all around the trunk.  Wished we had ordered it sooner.
B000BZG5OO|5|Works great, looks good, and is everything you would want from such a part. Not only that, but Amazon costs a third the cost and takes the same time to get to me as going to a store does.
B00DQZUDIU|5|Looks great fits great
B00F4YI3RO|5|Did the job thanks
B004ZF3Q98|5|I have installed this HID on 2011 Honda CRV. Only problem is, I got the DRL sign on dashboard . Mechanic told me that you have to buy error cancellor . Can you send me? That DRL sign is irritating.
B009PPL604|5|I actually watched this stuff dissolve the dark deposits on my intake valve.  Certainly did clean out my intake, great tuneup.
B006QLMLPY|5|Easy to install, fits great.  It's the perfect replacement for the faded front emblem we had on the wife's Edge.
B000C9LOHW|5|Like another buyer, I like the gasket.  It is some type of rubber gasket.  I used Permatex® Ultra Rubber Gasket Sealant & Dressing on both sides of it. I also used a new Dorman pan (265-811) with a drain bolt so I could drain the fluid one time between filter changes.<br /><br />Plagiarized but cannot put it any better:<br /><br />This filter came with a better gasket than others filters sets from my local auto parts. The price difference was a bit more but, for the better gasket it was worth it to me and Amazon had it for a good price.<br /><br />It was packaged very well from ACDelco. The gasket was sealed flat instead of folded in a box like a lot of others.
B000H774BY|3|I tested my new battery charger on my Toyota Prius and it works - but not without problems at first.  I started by charging the device through a regular power outlet. I didn't have any problems with charging it.  I then took it to my car. The car battery had a little juice left (enough to start the car) but I wanted to see whether the charger/booster could fully charge the car battery. It did not work when the car was fully turned off. I then started the car on \\"accessory\\" mode and then plugged in the charger (as directed by the instructions).  Not only did it not charge the battery.  It drained it and as a result I could no longer start the car!  I tried to charge it again, this time with the car was in full start-up mode.  After a few minutes of charging, it worked and it did fully charged the car battery.  Hope this comment could help those who couldn't get it working on a Prius.
B00LERYOVE|5|These roof rails look fantastic, much better than what the stock Subaru roof rail system and at less than half the dealer installed price. They came with a simple two page printed installation guide that was simple to follow, and took me around 30 minutes to install with simply a 10mm wrench. All the nuts/bolts/washers needed to install in the standard Subaru mounting points are included. They're well built, great to look at, and inexpensive.
B00413MWQC|5|The custom fit is great. Fits like a glove. Has been great for containing wet golf bags and beach stuff. Pull out, dump sand and put right back in.
B000GZT3IO|5|Great stuff!!
B002R1HWQA|4|Went in with out any real problems. They have been in at least 6 months and still look new. I would buy again.
B00BFC29VA|5|I am Very please
B0031I2SN0|5|I have purchase this part, to have it in stock.<br />Therefore, I assume that everything is as it should be and that it fits my Chevy Silverado 1997.
B011HE7LUO|4|Works as described. wish they had a bit of friction material on the bottom to keep them from sliding. Of course, once the bike is on them they do not move.
B002DQC00M|5|Perfect Fit, excellent quality.
B000CMJQGK|1|Not even close. Gave em away and bought Weather tech.
B0066KPYTK|5|Great fit
B000CACMMM|5|I looked for many days before purchasing this item.  Glad I chose this one.  It worked perfectly for a road trip from CA to CO in February through snow.  No leaks, no items wet.  Very easily installed, packed and removed.  Cannot wait to use it again for camping this summer.  Great Item!
B000AMBOLW|5|This is a nice cloth shade that has held up to 2 summers of folding and unfolding.  It is cheap and I can't find these things being sold even at the local auto hardware stores.
B000EFOZ9S|5|These were a great value for the money.  The dealership wanted $139 EACH so the price was right and they are very comparable to the original hubcaps that were on the van.
B00NLJ02ZA|5|great
B007F0RJ3O|5|Great fit.. factory look.  I know there are complaints about the two piece design but I don't really consider it an issue.  If I need to transport liquids (which is rare) I'll just take extra precautions.
B000KL3C5E|5|These mats are a perfect fit. No longer does dirt, debris, melted snow find its way all over the floor in my truck.  These floor mats are outstanding but the price is steep.
B002RNB70A|1|Did not work at all. Did not work at all. Did not work at all. Did not work at all. Did not work at all. Did not work at all.Did not work at all
B003TTX2H2|5|Fatmat sound deadner made my car sound much better! I have a 12 inch sundown audio 1250 watt rms sub. I'm gonna order 50 more sq ft. Its definitely something to pick up for the price
B000O0JQSS|5|Snapped right on to the end of the lever on my 2000 Excursion. The old one vanished one day after the teenagers drove it. Its not like you need to have it, but it makes the end of that lever much more comfortable with it there.
B00760B7OK|5|Since applying the Takamine logo to the back window of my SUV, I have had numerous fantastic looking women pass me, flashing big smiles.  A few of them actually had opened their blouses, which was totally unexpected!!  Since applying it, I have had more sex with incredible looking women than I ever would have imagined.  I actually had to drive a rental car for a while because I was getting sore from too much play!  I can't say that this sticker will do the same for you, but isn't it worth it to show the world that you are a fan of the best commercially made guitars in the land?
B00G9W6PE8|5|This has been great in my car to help prevent my purse from taking a tumble when I use the brakes.
B0000AXR7A|5|I used these for my 97 Seadoo GSI and my 96 Seadoo XP.
B000TYQAII|5|This part worked well for a 99.5 (New style Jetta). You'll need to drill out the big rivets on the old panel and attach the regulator with the supplied bolts. Works as well as OEM for a fraction of the cost.
B006HAKOW6|2|One mirror won't tighten enough to stay in place while riding
B006TMMI6M|5|Fit like a glove.  Arrived on time.
B00RC2VNNC|1|rubbish
B00HU6N3LK|3|Great product, it works but the instructions are pretty poor and the bottle could be labeled to make measurements easier. I lost a quarter of this product from measuring out the concentrate to water ratio. Using a tablespoon measure isn't the problem, it's getting the product off the the spoon completely is. Note that you will need to shake or mix this product well because the moment it touches water, it coagulates. On e properly mixed though, it cleans really well if you know how to carefully brush leather  with this cleaner.
B000XBFBZ0|4|Good quality.
B004L03854|5|My 5'X10' Utility Trailer is 15 year's old, and was time to Paint & Change out the Wireing that was Cracking and the Light's that were Rusted and Oxidized Len's. Followed the instruction's;  Everything Fit perfect, and the light's worked perfect.  My Trailer look's a lot better now with New Paint,, and New Light's and Wireing.  Very Good Buy.
B000Z0HVHA|5|perfect for what i am using it for
B00192QB9M|5|You have a Tesla? You need this to fabricate an adapter cable.
B002K4GGZW|4|The decal was shipped very fast but I expected an actual window decal.  I received the type you have to apply much like a temp tattoo.  Oh well it will still do for the price.
B002H9GRSQ|5|Not only was the price $60 cheaper than anywhere else, the shipping was cheap and lightning fast! Highly recommend this supplier!
B004RCP6HE|3|This sunshield was great the first week or so.... however, after that it lost it's shape and now it does not fit as well as before.  The rolling and unrolling of the sunshade I think is what cause the fit issue.
B0002MAANI|5|I have used these straps numerous times since purchase. No issues noted, locking mechanism works well with the thick webbing. The only thing I would like into next time were longer lengths rather than the 6' length. That is certainly not fault of the Highland Tie Downs, rather my decision at the time of purchase.
B000CZ3WYE|3|Not enough 0-rings for 8 injectors,It takes 2 -rings per injector when replacing them all still had to buy more locally
B004W97IY6|5|Light covers are nicer than I expected.  I have had many compliments on how &#34;cool&#34; they look. My factory installed ones let water in and these fit tight and look great.
B000E3GHUU|3|It's okay. Says the center panel is genuine sheepskin but looks as fake to me as the rest. Moves around on leather seats when you are sitting on them.
B001DRHMRI|5|Good
B000CQI06S|5|Great fit and great function.  Worth it.
B00DB8PQ1Q|4|OK
B00701Z4Y4|3|For the price this is a great deal, pretty easy install on my 07 wrx, and has a pretty awesome low sound. Overall I've been pretty happy with it. I would have given it 5 stars a few months ago.<br /><br />There is a major design flaw in terms of orientation on my car however (and on a 02 wagon, for reference). The mid pipe will point downwards to an angle that if you park in unsheltered parking rain water can collect in the car (it will be expelled on driving it again). Basically it just means that it's now quite rusted all over the place. I used to park inside so I never noticed it but I have to lower my rating now that I realize this issue with parking outside in a rainy city. Note that leaving in the included silencer probably would prevent this problem but lets face it, why do we buy these anyways?<br /><br />Also take note the length of the down pipe is a bit weird so when I bought a replacement cat-back I had to modify the pipes (cut and weld).
B0041U3MCI|5|Fit perfectly
B0049IZ3J2|5|I have it placed on the rear of a Honda Element and it works real well.  Does not vibrate or sway left and right.
B000COPALI|5|I had some worn extensions that these replaced, they look good and sound good and were a perfect fit. They should add to the life of my dual truck exhaust system considerably, Highly recommended!
B00AH57JQ6|1|The lights worked for about 5 months then 2 strands went out.  I contacted XKGlow and they sent out replacement lights.  The replacement lights they sent were broken as well.  I've tried contacting XKGlow multiple times but have not heard back.  Update:  XKGlow ended up sending replacement strands.  Then another strand blew and they sent another strand.  Today another strand of lights blew which would account for all 4 sides of the vehicle.
B008RUWVTS|4|This is an awesome helmet and well worth the price but it is not the same as the picture.  The picture shows the plastic around the face is white but the one I received is black.  I was very disappointed because I liked the white better and the picture should be exactly the same as the product they are selling.  Other then that I was happy and I would have given 5 stars if it was as pictured.
B000GU20J8|5|it was great it fits my 1983 Suzuki gs550e and its a great deal for the price
B002YKETS8|5|No chance of spilling with this attachment.
B00GBBCMDA|5|Got the floor mats in today for my 2014.5 Camry and they fit like a glove. Thanks for a great product and a big plus for saving me a ton of money that the dealership wants for these. 5 Stars
B005KOZ25Y|5|Extremely handy. If you are looking for an inexpensive device to read/reset/interpret codes from you car, this is a great choice.
B00029XHBI|1|not a very good horn, it is not as loud as i thought it would be and the whistle is very slow and it did not come with any wiring for the button or a button its self.. but after purchasing everything install was very easy... i would not recommend this horn to anyone get a better quality horn
B000WNSFCU|4|yes pleased with gas cap cant wait to put it on my truck?
B00029J2AS|1|the product not working efficiency , its not worst the money recommended to think again before buy it as its broken very fast
B0002V4PRG|4|it works as needed. yes its not made in the u.s. but for what i use it for (blowing up balls, tires) it works great.
B00LXK0HK4|1|They look the part but are not angled correctly, and I have only had them for roughly 6 months and already starting to fade and accumulate moisture. Do not recommend.
B002VY9J5K|5|i give this iteam a 5star because its a very great iteam & people around me even love the iteam when they see it.
B00AJVIU0W|5|Its nice to have a remote to control the spot from the back of the boat. The spot is located on the roof and I can not see its position from the cabin. Makes it difficult to aim from the cabin. With the remote I can control it from anywhere. The price makes it a no brainer.
B000CPC448|5|Fit my truck perfect.  Shipped fast, Was easy to install and looks very nice. added nice look to plain Jane truck.
B0090303BO|5|Excellent tuff cover!!!
B007VQULHI|5|This has been working for almost 8 months now.  Still working.  Feels like when i first got the car.  You have to be very careful when putting it in though.  It only goes in one position and there is a clip that you have to be aware of.  This clip will unlock the old one so you can pull it out.  Also, it will lock in the new one.  If i remember correctly, there is a holding screw too.
B000BUQOAE|5|A nice product to rinse both tanks on your rv if you don't have a factory rinse connection. Works real well glad i bought this one
B0021UMTZQ|1|nasty product for radiators  dont wais ur money they say 12 months guarantee but it didnt even pass a day and the crack on the radiator  came up again , it cost me $20 from advanced auto parts and i am returning it as i bought the whole radiator from amazon for 50 $ including taxes and shipping it woth new radiator .<br /> this can fix a plastic a fridge rack but not radiator ,<br /><br />DONT BUY IT FOR RADIATORS i just Tried it.
B00CBG817K|5|I was hesitant at first, because there wasn't much reviews on these. However, these wheel covers are great. I have had them for about a week on my 2000 Toyota corolla, they look nice and never came off. Fast delivery too.
B000CIPUR8|5|First, I bought Cataclean Engine and Catalytic Converter and after two months the car started to shut off and sound like the muffler has a hole. I rush order a bottle of CRC 05063 Guaranteed To Pass Emissions Test Formula, in the mean time I made an appointment with my mechanic. It arrives 1 days before the appoint and the car feels and sound better immediately. I have rescheduled then cancelled the appoint going 4 weeks now.     I bought a new O2 senor and was about planing to change to Cat, but why bother if it's running good.
B009GO6CYO|2|first summer I used it , the raise & lower switch filled with water and shorted out! now I have to replace that
B005N53AM2|5|Great product,it came on time.
B00JMXQI1G|5|Part fit flawlessly. Just like the original. Looks great.
B00080QHMM|5|This is much more accurate than the gauge on my portable pump. It's also easy to line up with the tire valve and seals as well as any  other gauge I've used. The LED display is large and easy to read even in bright sun light. Overall, the best gauge I've used so far. It''s more consistent than a pen gauge and much easier to read than a pen or dial gauge.
B000T2JIFM|5|My 2011 Ford Edge Limited 3.5L had 38,000 miles on it at the time I switched from conventional to full synthetic oil.  At my next oil change at 44,000 miles I was told that it was a quart low.  What?!  The car only has 44k miles!  New synthetic oil in.  I was noticing consistent oil spots on my garage floor that got so bad I used a huge refrigerator box under the car to catch it all.  It was leakung half a quart every 30 days!  Cue this stuff.  After reading the reviews here I gave it a shot.  I poured it into the existing oil and after about 200 or so miles the leaks seemed to slow down considerably.<br /><br />At 50,000 miles I took the car to the dealership for another oil change and told them about the leak.  The service shop ran dye through the engine and detected no leaks.  They did say that there was an oily mess from the old leak and that was likely the culprit for the residual oil drops I observed.  They cleaned it up and put new synthetic oil in.  The car is now at 56,500 miles and there are no signs of an oil leak whatsoever.  This bottle saved me hundreds on a seal change.  Very worth it in my case.
B0009I0DCS|5|Fits my camper perfectly! Highly recommand
B000C32IUK|4|It took quite a bit of tightening of the tensioner before the belt stopped squeaking. Once it did, the belt works great. Honestly, I can't tell by usage if it's better than another brand.  However, it does look well constructed. The materials look like they will last.
B006B3BUEK|5|Took awhile to install, but man they look awesome. They are illegal though. Cops might or might not bother you.
B002SE1F5K|5|Be careful. The product is okay, it just didn't fit even though all the criteria was correctly entered into Amazon's selection guide. Pertaining to a 2008 F150 Crew Cab Lariat, if you have \\"anything\\" (speaker, spare tire change tools, ect), this won't fit. Disappointed when it arrived. Called the factory and confirmed. Factory offered no solutions; no could they provide measurements, but found some on other websites. Have re-ordered the \\"supercab\\" size in hope that it will fit.
B004XNQLB2|3|Product is a little hard to use on my Sunsetter awning.
B007VXCYXA|1|Why not just remove the stock parts and rough them up with some 400 grit sandpaper? Then clean them and paint them flat black dummies...
B001EWUZVC|5|Excellent product, great price and makes my truck look amazing. Like night and day compared to the factory look. Happy with my purchase
B00877SL2M|1|While it is possible to find  LED's that are brighter than these, these worked perfectly for my purposes. I swapped out my license plate light, trunk light, and door step lights and I love the way they look. The only piece of advice i would give is that if you want these for any useful purpose other than looking good, perhaps you might want to go for the ones that have 4 LEDs on each side. Dont get me wrong, these things light up a very good amount, but if you want incredible light in a region such as your trunk, you might want to opt for something a bit more powerful.  UPDATE: I've stripped all of these from my car and have since gone with a far better brand. ALL of these started to flicker and die within only a few months of using them. Will not buy from this company again.
B001CI94DS|5|Very high quality. Once installed they stay put.
B0056BWU38|5|Just as expected.
B00076QA4C|2|The net fit well on my Lexus RX 350 and the separate compartments made organizing groceries easier. Unfortunately, the loop used to attach the net to the hooks in the car broke after only 2 months of use.
B00029WYVW|5|This cleaned my husbands air fliter real good. We should get better gas mileage now.  We hope any way. thanks
B001G7TS68|5|Worked great fast delivery
B000VT2LVQ|5|it really dresses my 2011 gmc sierra up the black look.I like it cause i can take them off to get my truck inspected:-)
B00HVJ899C|5|Very comfortable and fits my Honda SI seat perfectly. And the black colt is the correct color also received the merchandise on time.
B00A3NR8MW|1|I recieved the wrong color and I'm still waiting for the problem to be fixed taking it is taking a long time.
B0019JD904|3|Well i do like them and they work. i ordered them bigger than i thought because i wanted to wear them over my leather if need be but i could have ordered them in my size and it still would have worked out so order your size. i wish that they had the mesh inside of them but all in all they are nice.
B001O0D6RE|2|too long for my boat.  I am going to stop buying stuff online.  It is just too hard to know what fits and what don't
B00HVHWOAO|5|Do you ever drop your remote??? Well, I certainly did and the pieces scattered all over the ground! My husband's remote was being held together by superglue and tape. AWFUL looking! This product saves the day!<br />We should be able to keep our present remotes until we sell the car!
B005FMF9DQ|3|I have not received any camera tickets but don't think I have sped through any camera zones or run any red lights.  I gave three stars because my tag letter/number sequence is a little wider (randomly state issued, not vanity) than what the design of this product allows and may be considered to be obstructing the view of the tag, which may lead to a separate ticket. feel confidant that this product will work as advertised if I do accidently pass a camera a little above the speed limit.
B0041QIMRM|5|Great sounding easy to install
B00GAVZ3U0|5|PLAN ON GETTING MORE!! Stuck several on my welding helmets!
B00HTOB0NG|5|Great product and seller. Exceeded all expectations
B000GU13XM|5|I ordered it to replace the cracked original seatcover on my Yamaha Seca.  The seatcover has a drawstring used to hold it in place, but if you want it to fit correctly, I would recommend stapling it in place.  I have used a hand operated T50 stapler, but it is a pain.  If you are going to install this, I would recommend purchasing an inexpensive, pneumatic stapler that uses T50 staples (available on Amazon).<br /><br />After stapling the seatcover, it fit great.  You will either need to let the cover sit in a warm place prior to installation, or use a heat gun set on low to gently warm it and stretch it into place.  GUTS seat foams has an installation guide on their website that shows the sequence for stapling a seatcover in place.  The cover has a small amount of foam attached to help smooth out any irregularities in your seat foam.
B00EJA3BU8|5|Got here fast, worked instantly, solved the problem.  Thanks. Looks good in the truck.  Minor annoyance with a little rattle on one side (needs a cushion or bumper of some kind) but overall works great!
B0041GKR6G|4|Good solution for a hard surface problem.  Fits pretty good in my 2006 Honda Pilot.
B002G25MP8|3|I got this for my ShopVac; it works great, but for some reason it doesn't have the adapter required to attached to my 2\\" hose.  I had to go to Home Depot and get one for $5, which was a little annoying.  Still nice to have around!
B00IU34XZC|5|Great lift for the money!
B000SXCLIS|5|I am very pleased with the cover, it keeps the bike dry, and I love this hooks and the cable and lock. No concerns about it blowing off, getting stolen
B00N2DGS08|2|Poorly made product.Feels very cheap.  One of the visors was damaged during delivery. Would not recommend.
B0016GRTVU|5|Got this right before a big storm. Glad I did.  Outstanding product. Durable and good quality bristles. Extends and retracts with ease.
B0071I3146|3|Part fit, was easy to install, and the housing looks basically the same as the original part. One major problem with the product, however, is that the mirror itself is warped causing distortion on the top part of the mirror.
B00BD2P7X4|5|My husband loves it!
B009PICJTI|4|Worked out perfectly for my 65 K10 chevy. Only thing was the mounting even though universal i dont think its that universal. luckily my radiator had mounting tabs i riveted the unit to. Fit more than perfect pull lots of air and seem to do what they are suppose to. only problem i had was the wire colors were switched on one fan so it ran backwards. so i just swapped the leads.
B0006H9364|5|This worked great in our Rialta. Trick is getting the toilet out. There is a hidden port/cover at back of toilet that allows you to remove the rear nut with socket and extensions.(ther are 2 nuts securing toilet - right front, left rear)  Look for it, you'll find it. To replace the nut I placed a hanger rod on top of stud (thru access hole) and then dropped the nut on hanger rod, so it slid down the rod and ends up on the top of stud ready to be tightened. There is no other way to position the nut. Tight with fingers and then socket or stubby wrench.<br /><br />This brings the seat up the perfect height and fits exactly in the spot for the Rialta. Almost looks like it was made for it. Even include the longer studs you will need.
B00M3ICL4A|1|Broke putting them on.
B00871CJ1W|4|Na bad product. Cool pricing.
B00C450QVW|5|Nice i have no complaints : -)
B001Q8DMA0|5|Large, absorbent, and of high quality. For the price you won't find anything better. Since this is a waffle weave towel it won't leave little fibers on the car, either.
B001DIECCK|5|Ok is perfect
B007CPLKN2|5|Worked perfectly!!!!!!!
B000C04LOE|5|The semi loaded friction caliper came exactly as describe. It was exactly what I was looking for, very easy to install.
B001HMAXYI|4|This is a nice catalytic converter. I installed two of these on a Land Rover Discovery 1. The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars is because the heat shields rattled badly, and had to be tacked in place.
B008G35XHI|3|These headlights look good, especially compared to my old, hazy ones. However, the bulb retaining clips were cheap and the bulb rattled around like crazy. I threw their clips away and reused the OE ones, which worked just fine. I guess I got what I paid for.
B000AMBNPY|3|I wanted this to be better than it was.  The back window would only stay when we stuck it in there using tools from home.  It would not stay at all.  The side windows worked well.  It is not too dark, which does not help enough in the direct sunlight, but it is also a perk to keep your child entertained as they still have the ability to look out the window.  I would not buy it again, but it does get the job done and I am still using on the back window to keep the sun out of the car and off the kids.
B000EVYGZA|5|Nice DVM with an excellent battery tester function. Doesn't get any better than this when looking for an inexpensive DVM.
B000C5FSKA|2|The wrong item was ordered
B00GDQM0W6|5|extra bright, just plug them in
B00EZMTQ5Y|1|Very disappointed with product,did not find it to be as stated.
B00AKY0JZC|3|Not much to say. China junk. Its not gonna last long wouldnt waste the money on this again.. It took awhile to get here comes from china. Product received with plastic allready chipped.
B0009VIQ1A|5|I love it! this duster really work great. Only buy the original California duster. be sure you hit the duster on tire often to get dust off works much better.
B005VX1V18|5|Arrived on right on time, a bit more pricey than some of the generic replacement parts, easy to install, perfect quality!
B00GLFN3WK|5|PowerProb is an excellent tool to add to your toolbox and I've used it several times  and it's very handy
B00Q026Q2I|5|Works exactly as you would expect.  No problems.
B00386UHWY|5|Awesome product fit my 2000 4runner perfectly. Only thing is if you end up breaking a sway bar link like I did, and replacing it, they come with bushings. At least mine did so now I have an extra set of bushings.
B002QS3F9C|5|Just what you need on a Ford diesel that does not have a pyrometer; however, it failed after a few weeks.  Edge Products replaced the product and the replacement has worked for a year.
B00HDSI7V6|1|If I could I would post zero stars for the description of the sale item, which is  nonsensical.  I get &#34;Weller Tip Std For 7200&#34;  because the 7200 is the model of the soldering gun.  But what is &#34;Sold Gun 7235 (1 Each) 7235&#34; ???  And 7235 is the part number for only one of the five tips pictured (the standard tip).  So are you buying a kit with five identical soldering tips (the 7235), or five different soldering tips (as pictured), or is it just one standard soldering tip, the #7235?<br /><br />I've asked the question numerous times but it's not answered and never appears in the Questions section,  I wouldn't bother with this but I've been looking all over for weeks and this is the only mention I've found a the possibility of a smoothing tip for the Weller 7200.
B0006302OU|4|I have really only been using the K&N for about 2-3K miles so far.  I've noticed I can 'hear' the intake sucking air more with this air filter so I believe it when I read that it flows better.  With higher air flow, I'll be curious to see how much the filtration decreases over a stock filter.  My guess would be the filtration will suffer, but not horribly bad or in a dangerous way.  Do not expect a huge HP increase with this filter, but I did get my best gas mileage after doing this filter, oil change, and spark plugs (37mpg HW).      In all I recommend this filter (so far) to anyone who plans on keeping their car for a while.  With the cost of the filter and recharge kit, it is only saving you money if you plan on keeping your car for 90-120K miles after purchase of the filter.
B001C6NE40|2|While this is a good product, it didn't meet my needs at all.
B003UT3S6Q|4|I've been trying different wheel cleaners for years . . . I had one for the chrome wheels on my truck and my car and another for the aluminum wheels on my wifes car.  They were all a pain.  Had to spray on brush like crazy and rinse off before they dry or you have a real mess on your hands.  Tried Sonax and was amazed.  It works on all surfaces . . .simple to use . . .spray on green . . .wait til it turns red and rinse off . . .that's it!  Wheels look fantastic.  Removes brake dust better than any product I've ever used.  However, as great as it is . . .it could be priced more reasonably.  You only get approximately 5 uses for $15.95
B00A3YXBT0|4|A whole lot cheaper than at the honda dealer. Almost identical to the one that came out quality wise. Direct fit for my 4 wheeler.
B004V49EYE|2|this sticker appears to be a single sticker of 5 bears... it is actually 5 stickers of 1 bear each... there is a white border around each bear thus the interlocking of arms is not possible if you attempt to recreate the item a shown
B007BD2BQA|5|My husband runs CAT equipment so I thought this would go great in the window of his pickup. He loves it!
B000COBC7O|4|You have to be careful with even spacing, about 12&#34; apart. Looks almost original on a black sports car. Much better than spending thousands on new headliner.
B003AVVMLM|5|Great price, didn't realize these were I pairs. They went right I the top but had to fight a little with the lowers.
B00KTIY6BW|4|Works well with my 2000 mustang. So glad I have a remote now. It really helps out a lot.
B00H3TMFR2|2|Cheesy looking chrome.....
B007XF9C9A|3|The costume is well made for the price..  Easy to put on/take off.  Purchased for 8 year old.  Ordered the large as afraid the smaller size would not fit.  Not surprisingly the costume was large although it was certainly wearable.  Probably could be worn by an a\&#34;average&#34; sized adult.  Cute costume.  The disappointing part was that there were no cut outs for the eyes; you actually look out of the mouth of the headpiece.  I can't remember if this was mentioned in the item description or not; I WAS aware of this when I made the purchase.  The child I purchased it for knew this also but wanted the costume anyway.  Unfortunately he only wore it a few times and now it is stored away.  The child also mentioned  he felt &#34;hot&#34; in the costume after a short period of wearing.
B0058A21LI|4|Great value for what they are, but for real visibility, could be brighter (as always, I suppose).  Had some flashback on the windshield, needed to make a shroud to fit my windshield.  Wired right in and have been working great in my personal - turned - state authorized emergency vehicle.
B006TMK54Y|5|Installed like factory and looks great.  No problems.<br />This has a slightly different venting mechanism than the original but it makes no difference.<br />Bulbs fastened in with no forcing required.  No alignment issues.
B005FJXSHS|4|Great price compared to other rotor and brake set. After using it for about a year, I can say that it does it's job, however, parts of it does rust a little and there is a small throbbing sound when you start slowing down from a high speed. It almost sounds like the rotors and brakes are not aligned and it's wobbling even though they are completely screwed in and flushed together. The braking power is not that great. You can slam on the brakes and your car will stop, however, personally it sometimes feels like the brakes are not as good as other ones or it takes a split second longer than it should to do a complete stop. These are obviously not top of the line rotors and brakes so I don't have much to complain about especially for the price.
B003AH8GBK|5|I've bought two of these, one for my old car which I sold and then needed another for my new car because I loved the first one so much. The size is perfect, not too small and not too big. Goes on really easy and stays on well, I have gone through multiple car washes and it has remained in perfect condition. I have had a lot of people asking me where I got my decal, this is a must have for NBC lovers!
B001NF2VO4|5|East and quick to install; around 10 minutes.
B0068EUAR0|5|On target
B000J2I7T0|3|I found these just got in the way
B00CKCZNTY|5|Just bought a 2014 Mazda6 and these look great in it!  Very classy and work very well.  I'm very short and these keep the seat belt from choking me.
B000CMH1WQ|5|good,,,,,, liked it. cool to the touch, I think because it transfers heat from from my hand when I touch it
B002S9UWUO|5|it works
B0028JLO3I|4|My vehicle is still in storage, so I have yet to install this mirror.  I purchased this component to give my rice rocket more of a JDM look.  Very happy with the construction.  Feels solid and well built.  The spring clamps also feel robust.  However, as I said, I have yet to actually install the mirror over my factory assembly.  Hopefully it clamps on securely and remains fixed without issue.  I have a very rigid suspension, so my expectations are quite high.
B00KTHYEAQ|5|Worked perfectly. Online instructions were correct. No problems
B009NIG950|5|These work killer.  Best soft racks.  Easy to install, super secure.<br /><br />Love 'em.
B00EAOIR8O|5|Purchased a used vehicle owned by a smoker.  Didn't even know vehicles had these!! The new filter did wonders for the truck once we replaced this!!
B006DA2EPA|5|This is a great intake. Very well made and fits like a glove. With this installed on my Taurus SHO you can really hear the twin turbos spool up and spit the extra boost out the waste gate.
B00JIEX722|5|Good lights.
B0008FUHUA|5|Bought this for the hitch mount on my quad.<br />It fits fine, and the amount of lift is just right.
B000QV4Z3Q|4|excelent product, good alternator, recomended, good, good ,good ,good good good good good good good good good good good good good.
B000ALG86E|5|I use this cover for my CLK 430.  I asked the dealership how much it would cost for a cover for this car and they said close to $150.  Found this online and covers the great really well and for a fraction of the cost!  A great find.
B000CKLWL4|4|worked well and what wad decrided was there
B00TUJUCR8|4|Didn't come with enough padding
B006SA3T90|5|A+
B0000AXQE8|5|I got this for my hubby who is a trucker. He wanted something to heat water for soup and stuff and didn't take up much room. This was perfect for him as he is a trainor and there isn't alot of room on the truck with 2 people constantly going in and out. He enjoys this and loves how it is compact enough to heat up his water on the og.
B0018J0Y44|5|You never know when you will need a stubby screw driver. Having changable bits keeps things portable. I don't want the tool bag getting too heavy from regular screw drivers. This is a perfect solution.
B005OY72MG|4|Application to a golf cart is more difficult than it sounds.  First, you will be applying a flat sheet of graphics to rounded surfaces.  It is impossible to do this task without wrinkles to accomodate curves. It will take two people to apply the graphics. On some of the curves it will be necessary to piece the graphics to accomodate some areas.  After application these wrinkles and piecings will hardly be notices because the camo pattern covers these imperfections. This Mossy Oak Graphics Kit did make the necessary changes in looks that we desired to use for hunting transpertation.
B004WKH0O8|5|Very good product. Use it in my 1967 GTO
B000C57YQG|4|This job has to be one of the most mentally challenging ones I have done.<br />My torque wrench doesn't go to 300 ft/lbs, I don't have a collection of mega wrenches and sockets, Or at least I didn't.<br />My decision to buy a floor jack instead of jack stands was a good one. You will need jack stands too though.<br />There are two schools on this project; grind off the rivets (I own a grinder now but it was to tight in there to use) or disassemble the front end. There is a lot of talk about cutting them with a torch on the web. Your wires, gas line, and brake lines run along the frame plus to much heat may detemper the metal so yah do that. One had already been replaced the first way so I tried both ways in the end. Once you get the hang of disassembling a front end that way makes more sense. Besides I own all these neat tools now. A trailer hitch wrench purchased from harbor freight was very handy on the leaf spring, cheap too.<br />Oh ya, I don't want to do this again so buy these guys not the rubber ones. They are supposed to last longer.
B00062Z46C|5|Very good
B006PEE7TK|4|Not much to say about this except is works as it is intended.  I would have preferred a straight 15 to 30 adapter but could not find one so settled on this one.  It seems well enough made that there was no struggle connecting or disconnecting yet it seems to stay plugged in when needed.  Did not give it 5 stars because its not something one would \\"love\\"
B000CIK8S4|5|Sounds like I have something under the hood. Still a miata so it's not very powerful. Still increased the smile factor.
B009TTCGYG|3|Not made of very thick fabric, and not very long. It will be fine for my child to wear, and trade pins.
B00SHZHKWQ|5|Bought this set for my 09 Dodge Ram 1500 and I'm very happy that I did.  Everything fit perfectly and was so easy to install-  took me 10-15 minutes max.  Not to mention the set really improved the appearance of my truck.  It really looks nice!  This was also the most affordable way to go instead of buying each separate piece- saved me about $180.
B004HGN492|5|This factory part fits perfectly in my 2007 Charger as intended.  I have talked to some other Charger owners, and imagine their surprise when they found out just like I did that not all Challengers, Chargers, and Chrysler 300s have this part from the factory.  It was part of an options group that most cars don't have if you didn't get side curtain airbags and some other protection stuff.  I believe it was called the Protection Group.<br /><br />There were factory instructions for installation in the box and they were helpful for the most part.  Since they apply to a wide variety of models, you have to check each step to see if you actually have to do that part.  Additionally, this was cheaper than purchasing through a dealer, where they want at least $72 for the part.  Be prepared for shipping to be slow (about 10 days), but this is acceptable as this is not going to be a mechanically critical part for anyone.<br /><br />*Edit:  I went back and looked and the Plastic Rivets were included but hidden in the packing material.  Updated to a five star review as a result.  The following portion is outdated, but I will leave it here in case others have similar concerns.<br />--I did not receive any \\"Plastic Rivets\\" in the box.  This is a problem as you ruin the old ones trying to due this installation.  Once you pull them out, you cannot really use them again.  You can search the internet for them easily enough and they are sometimes called \\"Christmas Tree\\" rivets.  You can find them at auto parts stores, but it would have been nice to come with the part.--<br /><br />Install takes less than an hour with basic tools.
B00IQBGOPU|5|Very impressive. Nice looking, don't take up much space, extremely bright (I Mean WOW). Only down side is that they are all plastic. I would rather have stainless or metal of some sort, but still a very cool light. You will be seen, that's for sure!
B005Y3IWSU|4|had this on my rsx before i sold it. sounds really deep a lot deeper than most mufflers/exhaust.
B006P86QAY|1|This patch is not even close to the quality of the picture. The detail is horrible. It looks like a 2 year old took some brown, red, white and blue crayons and colored it!!
B008G329DO|5|Quality lights cheap needed 2 best deal I could find on a pair
B003AO6QGA|5|I bought this for my Subaru Impreza Outback Wagon for the 100k tune up. It came with everything you need and more. A GREAT price as well. If you are looking for a cheap alternative to taking it to the dealership, this is the way to go. If you aren't afraid to do it yourself, it will save you well over $300!
B001TQ6DMS|5|Great highway lights with low current requirements. I've used these on two motorcycles to supplement the stock lighting without using as much power as halogens.
B002UX6MB6|5|warmth in these cold months, up in Oregon, is an important thing... want to stay warm? if your an all weather rider you need this
B003FVFV46|5|wife love it
B0009H520C|5|Perfect for our needs.
B003I82DIS|5|The original shocks from the factory on my F-250 diesel pickup were replaced after 3 years and 28,000 miles with Bilsteins which lasted 9 years and 137,500 miles. Even if Bilstein does not live up to their lifetime free replacement it's still a great product.
B00EVY3RQU|3|The saddlebags were the only pieces I could use.
B000ZALNI8|2|The seat covers do not cover the seat portion the way they show. Also received console covers that I don't know what to do with?? I think these do not belong to the truck I described.
B000E81VN8|5|Just what I needed! Perfect to store items in back of Subaru Outback or any vehicle needing stable, firm organizer. Love the adjustability! Solid, well built product.
B000BZL07Q|1|Although Bosch says it is compatible with my car (1996 Toyota Land Cruiser) for the upstream oxygen sensor, my car throws a P0135 error code, which means the current draw of the heater is either too much or too little.  The resistance of the heater is 3.8 ohms, but in the specs for my car, it says resistance must be 11-16 ohms.  So it draws too much current.  Either the oxygen sensor is broken or it's not built to specification.  Either way, this sensor does not work for my car.  I've called their warranty service line which is a recording, and haven't heard back from them.    Other than that, the part looks and feels sturdy and fit perfectly.  However the smartlink connector was a pain to set up, it took a few hours.      If I had to do it all over I would probably by an OE style oxygen sensor not from Bosch.
B000C0UMO2|5|excellent
B001O05S16|5|I chased a rough idle and random missing in my Intech 32V Lincoln engine for over a year. Replaced intake gasket, valve cover gaskets, boots, plugs and it still had a random miss. I bought the ACCEL SuperCoil kit and the engine runs like new. No miss, smooth idle and great throttle response. Absolutely the best purchase you can make for your engine. Old coils just can't provide the strong spark needed for these engines.
B000W0KTKY|2|I bought this for my bike because It didn't seem like the more expensive locks with the alarms were much of an improvement for the high price difference according to reviews. I read other reviews that said this lock sticks and I was like, okay fine ill lube it up and I did. I have had trouble with this lock sticking twice and it seem simple enough to jiggle it around for a while until it unlocks but its not worth the risk of having this get stuck.
B00381BSKO|4|Not much I can add that other posters haven't covered so I'll just say it's not a great value compared to a spray bottle and a micro fibre rag, but it's convenient and works well.  The towelettes are almost over saturated to the point where it does streak and apply a bit messy the first minute you use one.  I've over come streaking problem by spreading it around across my dash and console and then coming back over it once more on the way back to rub in the excess once it starts getting dry.  I'd say 2 towelettes will do most neglected interiors, 1 if you clean your car every couple of weeks.
B001UC3BQW|5|works great and shipped fast
B00BMALVWS|5|Just finished touching up some small scratches on my car with this 2K clearcoat.  I was quoted $700 at the dealership for a deep scratch about 2&#34; long!  For about $70 total, I repaired and painted the scratch as well as the lower portion of my front bumper, that had been kerbed at one time and was a mess.  This sprays on really well with a nice even fan, oriented vertically or horizontally by rotating the nozzle.  It hardens within 30 mins or so to a high gloss shine.  There's some orange peel effect, but no doubt that will mostly buff out with the final step of 1600 =&#62; 2000 grit wet sanding and cutting in with polishing compound.  The original OEM paint has similar, but less pronounced, orange peel.  The clearcoat has no color so if your base coat color matches, it still will after clear-coating with this product.  I tried another 1K clearcoat on my first repair attempt and it turned my beautiful white paint yellow!  Thankfully a rag and some lacquer thinner wiped it all away for another attempt.  I wasn't sure if this 2-pack would be compatible with a lacquer-based (1K) base coat, but I did a test spray on an old sheet of steel and while there was some crinkling where I'd deliberately applied a really thick coat of base, the rest of the normal thickness paint wasn't affected.  On the car itself, it worked great.  Hopefully there's no long term issue with this - time will tell!  I'll surely buy this clearcoat again next time I want an OEM finish paint job that's resistant to solvents. It seems expensive compared with other 1K clear coats, but not for its functionality, clarity and durability.  Please beware:  You've really got to wear a respirator when spraying this product.  The fumes are toxic. I used &#34;3M 07193 Paint Spray Resp. Large&#34; from Amazon.  Update:  This morning, after an overnight wait at unheated garage temps,(approx 14 hours since application), I finished cutting back the clear coat.  I found the 1500 grit too aggressive.  2000 grit worked just fine to remove any orange peel and blend in to the original clear coat.  The clearcoat was still &#34;soft&#34; enough to not need anything coarser that 2000 grit.  It will continue to cure over the next few days/weeks.  Machine and hand buffing resulted in a near perfect gloss finish.  See my uploaded photo of the finished job.  VERY pleased with this product and will use again!  Update:  Sept 2015.  Looks just as good as when I applied it after 1.5 years and hot TX sun.    Very happy!
B00DB42QJA|1|I like how this looks, but the antenna does not perform how the stock antenna performs.  I would not recommend this item.
B000BNMQUS|5|Excellent product.  Had these before on an Impala about 10 yrs. ago   When I traded the car in the carpeting looked like the day it was new.  They are very easy to install and keep clean.  Matches original carpet exactly. I bought them for front back and cargo area.  For the Cargo area I purchased the one without the carpet.  I recommend this if you use the cargo area a lot. Using on 2008 Equinox now and they are an exact fit.
B00B788KRO|5|This is a wonderful odor eliminator! It has such a clean orange scent that I use it all over the house.
B005WUPZ9Y|4|This item  was received as advertised, in excellent condition, with quick delivery. The only problem I've encountered is that the clips for closing the bag are hard to get to when mounted on my bike, still a good product
B00OC9HMTM|2|Very bright! Yet bolts came stripped out.
B008DZZXB0|5|I ordered these mats for doors on my outside dog houses. It is very heavy and good quality rubber material and is perfect for what I needed! A really good buy too!
B000UK1WYS|5|Arrive on time and work great
B000BZJ6J0|5|perfect fit, great price, i used this in my 99 jeep cherokee sport, it is the front oxygen sensor<br /><br />bosh is a quality part
B000WKHPZQ|5|Perfect. I am putting them on next week. They give my 2003 VTX 1800R a wilder look without (I hope) reducing the comfort of the long ride.
B000CJ2V1U|5|Just wanted to say that this fit my 2003 Grand Cherokee Overland 4.7 just fine. Works great.
B0008G1NB6|5|My husband wanted this fifth rail kit for a hitch that he picked up, and I suggested he look for it on Amazon! No surprise to me,But it was to him, that it was for sale on Amazon & at a great price. We received them very quickly and the packaging was so very sturdy! That is good, because they are so heavy. He said they are better than he hoped for and the instructions for putting them in were excellent! Thank you so much! I think he will be another amazon fan!
B00E838HY6|5|Just as described
B003YMRO82|5|Perfect OEM fit for my Subaru. Braking is smooth and the price is right.
B0016NEBCI|1|I opened this and it has no charging ports for an iPod or iPhone as stated in the description. I am very disappointed and am sending it back.
B007VJ2IJO|5|Been waiting for this product to come out for a while! It's the best of the best. Car care products with attitude!
B003978QIE|5|Great product and fast delivery
B00HI028TG|5|Works great.  Did come with the filter.  Half the price of 25841885 for the exact same pump (even the part number on the pump is the same).  Except this one comes with the filter and 25841885 does not.
B003GCSJAC|5|great product to for self defense at a great price.Highly recomend to anyone looking for a self defense tool that easy to use
B0002Z9QO4|4|We purchased this carrier for my daughter when she was moving from Michigan to Portland Oregon. Her car doesn't have racks on the roof...and we had read reviews that this rooftop carrier could work without the racks. We packed it full with clothes, used the hooks and straps provided, and tied it on tight and it worked great. They didn't have any rain on the trip so not sure about how it would hold up for leaks. It seemed to have good flaps over the zipper as to stop any rain from getting in. For the very reasonable price it was well worth it for the extra room she needed for moving.
B004YWV3TC|4|For the price a good product. A little rough but keeps water and moisture off of car.
B002DW7V5A|5|Exactly what I wanted and needed for my 2013 Honda Insight. Fits perfect and looks great! Hope to get more car accessories for my car next time.
B00LEBLI82|5|These bulbs improved the lighting in our 5th wheel immensely. We liked them so much we ordered this second batch so we could change ALL lights out. I have eye problems and lighting is very important to us.
B0081S9EKK|4|Part does not match picture as advertised but works
B0077FJ2MS|4|this was the perfect replacement part after our van was wrecked. Super easy to install and runs better than before.
B0023V05OU|5|i been using this product for a few years now<br />the females love the scent.<br />point blank your car have to smell right<br /> CHUUCH!
B0009PCPNQ|3|Good
B00C0XCHKG|5|I received it in less than a week from Fedex. Removing the old one took some power but this new one bolted right on. Took pics for old and new comparison. It's way bigger than stock and should make a big handling difference. Go for it.
B0055B0SGK|5|Great Purchase
B002QVU4RK|5|Purchase and delivery was quick and easy. The product itself seems to have increased my fuel economy by 2-3 MPG. In the spring I usually get around 46 mpg (Prius Gen3). Even when the car was brand new the best I ever got with my daily commute was 48mpg.  Since installing this air filter, which is super easy and only takes about 2 minutes. I've been getting about 49mpg.
B002R0R3A6|3|The first one cracked at the back and water entered surring a rain. Second one is holding up so far (4weeks).
B000W0TM6Q|1|I bought this lock for my Toyota Sequoia (2\\" hitch).  The  lock gets stuck and does not matter what you try to do with the key, oiled , W40 .... you name it , you can not open it once it is stuck.  Mine was used perhaps 3 times, never stayed in the hitch for more than 1 week.  If you can not easily open this thing it is not worth it .  I ended up ordering a different brand.
B0015FYQ90|4|I woud definitely recommend this mirror to friends - in fact, my sister-in-law really liked it and is going to order it.
B005MMPCDQ|4|If you own a BMW in the specified range of years for this scanner, then this product is for you. There is a separate computer in you BMW that controls your airbags. When the light goes off, it could be a number of problems. This tool allows you to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.
B002LCD9XU|5|A little complicated to stick on, so be careful! Great quality, though!
B003ZKKMLE|5|Plugged it in, everything worked, no issues at all.<br /><br />Immediately picked up by my laptop, connected to my Rocket 3.<br /><br />TuneECU is such a great free utility, it's good to see it works with this cable.<br /><br />Seems nicely made, nothing cheap about it, except the price.
B000CMJ2KU|5|Easier than a 4 way to loosen lug nuts.. Works with custom wheels that require a thin wall socket. Have one I purchased locally several years ago, extreamlly satisfied, needed one for another car with custom wheels, could not find locally.. with amazon free shipping I orderd 2. recived in a couple of days.
B005BHX3QK|5|Worked great
B0009IR0A6|5|Works great on our van that has 200,000 miles.
B00RDMBTNA|5|I just used my  wash mitts! AMAZING!  My Black van shows EVERY missed spot. It was so easy to wash with these Mitts! Fast delivery, and great product. I'm going to order more for Christmas gifts for my sons.
B000C5PZP8|5|Perfect
B008OYE3QG|5|When I got the package of bulbs I was like &#34;this is it&#34;??? I can't tell you how simple it was to replace them with the LED's pop out the old and in with the new.  World of difference in a comfort brightness and not blinded.  Very impressed.
B001GMXRZ6|5|What can I say?  It's a chunk of metal.
B001ZTBG8A|5|Works great. I'm using it to power motor cycle stereo on my bicycle. It's the perfect size! I am running two of them.
B00EZY337E|2|Back is flat and most campers have a ridge side. Be prepared to use some caulking to seam. I lost the first cover on my trip so make sure it is snapped in tightly.
B00MQD4I0M|4|Delivered over a week late, but aside from that all is good
B008QXZ5UI|5|work great. recommend as a preventative measure
B000C5SG5O|4|Fixed my truck's stumbling issue and self test/check engine failure. Does not look like the picture. Metal shield over sensor has slots pressed in, not rows of holes.
B002OUMVWY|5|We bought a rv trailer recently and it came with a short cheap hose.  This hose has met my expectations to the fullest and has been very durable
B004I0UC4W|3|Doesn't line up properly on 1997 Ford Explorer XLT. The lenses sit low in the opening. Appear to be well made.
B004D5Q3F4|5|These are excellent filters. One heck of a deal and I will continue to order them!!!! Best deal around anywhere!!!!!
B00KAKG43C|4|it is great.
B002304T9S|5|Fit my 1982 Yamaha 650, so I am happy
B000BZL2MO|5|Sensor was delivered earlier then estimated at checkout and came complete with a new wire harness . Installation was done in five minutes and on the test drive the hesitation and lack of power starting off from a complete stop disappear,  also on the third startup of the vehicle the check engine light went out. Very happy with the outcome.
B00AMBSBL2|1|These things are spunges and I'm guessing the bacteria living in there is toxic.  I just took them off a bike I bought.  The seller no doubt put them on before selling.  The foam lasted two months before tearing.  When they get wet in the rain, they are going to stay wet the rest of the day.
B000C7ZDB2|5|Works good easy to install
B00KMBEMZG|5|I bought two of these for a pair of 7 year old remotes that were really getting tough to operate.  It took about 10 minutes to replace them both because the remotes were pretty grubby and I took a few minutes to clean them up.  Since the replacement the remotes work like new and I am well pleased with the results!
B00G4RW510|5|A very good touch-up solution!
B002LYTHUM|5|Best ramp I ever found for loading a 1500# gold wing.  Rated for center loading of this massive cruiser where other ramps may fail.
B000EVYH72|4|Works fine and cost a lot less than most! Used it for timing and for showing spark misses. Handy unit.
B00062ZPSE|5|Just what wanted
B001AX82VK|5|it works
B000QGZXCS|5|Used it in the Coast Guard to polish the brass, 15 years later and I still rely on Nevrdull.
B000CO7IDQ|5|Shipped fast, easy to install and they are working good... good tight fit on the connections. Longer lead wires would be a ++++
B00332GOJ8|5|I installed them myself, easy to install, they looks nice on my Jeep.<br />Verry happy with this product by Westin
B0009IQX90|5|I have used Meguiar's and it seems to be as good as any other brand I have used. Its simple to use and is great for the inbetween washes.
B000MS9VZK|5|I just recently bought a Optima 8020-164 35 RedTop Starting Battery for my Honda Accord.  I had Optimas in my past vehicles and my current truck has one as well.  No one in the area stocks this battery and I was a bit hesitant about buying this battery online with the past reviews about buying and shipping from Amazon directly, being damaged and not honoring the return.  I took a chance with Blue Grass Battery.  I'm Glad that I did.  It came DOUBLE BOXED with shipping peanuts.  It came in IMMACULATE condition, better than in some stores.  I would definately buy from BLUE GRASS BATTERY again!!!!!  GREAT PURCHASE, WOULD RECOMMEND BLUE GRASS BATTERY HIGHLY TO ALL!!!!!
B001L2ZCE0|2|I bought this same item from the national chain mentioned in the other review.  I like the design quite a lot.  I previously bought and used the \\"two sticks\\" type of spring compressor (Advanced Tool Design ATD-3054) from Amazon and wanted an upgrade in strength and safety.    When I opened the box, the first thing I did was take the nut which engages the main drive screw and started to spin it down the whole length of the screw.  I only got about 5\\" down the drive screw when the nut bound up.  A close inspection revealed that the drive screw thread had been damaged, presumably in transit from overseas.  I feel the packaging was at fault here, as the main drive screw was just lying unprotected in the bottom of the box, and the diamond-shaped accessory steel yoke had apparently been banging on the screw threads.  If the drive screw had been packed with some foam around it, the damage wouldn't have occurred.    I probably could have fixed it by buying a die and chasing the thread to clean up the damaged area.  I chose not to do that and returned the item to the store for a refund.  You shouldn't have to fix a new tool before you can use it.    I really do like the general design.  So much so that I've ordered the OTC 6494 clamshell compressor from Amazon, which is a very similar unit but quite a bit more expensive.  If that compressor lives up to my expectations I'll write up a review on it after I've used it.
B001UA7P3E|5|Awesome jacket, very comfortable considering the armored padding. Runs a bit small. I normally wear a large but this extra large almost fit me perfect. it was just a bit big on me, but a large was just a bit to snug for riding.
B000EW0KPY|5|Go figure, it's a vacuum tester, and it does it's job as described.
B001PNO368|5|I used this switch for a 2000 lb winch.  I had to buy some connectors at my local hardware store but no biggee.  Don't try to solder the wires directly to the switch, you'll just fry the unit.  I soldered 10 gage wire onto connectors and then put it inside a standard plastic outlet box and covered it with a metal outlet cover. I can now stand a few feet from my 25 foot trailer and pull a full size car.  Using an ohm meter, I could detect which prongs I needed to connect the battery in and out.<br /><br />Just what I needed.  Saved myself about $80 from having to buy an of the shelf product.  Some of those winch companies are too proud of their product.
B003YV1NPS|5|Thanks
B00BSEJYCM|5|Just as expected
B000BUU5T0|5|worked well
B001BNASI4|5|Love great quality!
B0051D3MP6|5|Does the deed (of maintaining, not fully charging, a battery) at a great price--from inside or outside the rig (making it convenient for different vehicles in different settings....)
B006P869B0|5|I've been a fan of K&N filters for a long time... No Problem here... The price was right and the service excellent... Thanks
B007P05FBW|5|i drive a 2008 f-250, before, if you dropped the tailgate you would think that a bomb went off and or the cables were going to snap in the process.  Once you install this, your tailgate will effortlessly glide down as gentle as a feather!
B0002NIG56|2|This had a great look on my truck, but on the 3rd day while I was going down the freeway, it just blew right off.  Perhaps being removable isn't good for this type of product.
B001AMA93U|4|Gabriell air shocks exceeded my expectations. my ford has a trailer hitch and pulls a 22' ski boat. i installed a new set ot monroe's regular shocks and they both developed leaks within 45 day's. ( i was able to return them for a full refund). the gabriel's ride well at 28psi and haul a load well at 60psi. THUMBS UP !!  RICHARD, DALLAS, TX.
B0040ZIVA2|4|it is a good, easy to find key ring. it does have a swivel between key ring and the fob section.
B000EALHHG|5|Duck Tape, WD-40 and Oil Eater.  I wasn't able to find it at my local stores and without Oil Eater in my tool box wasn't complete.  Thanks to Amazon, I'm a happy guy.<br /><br />Rich
B0002SR57Q|5|Worked great - nice bright light that's easy to see, long cord so you can position it up by the windshield to make it even easier to see, and the adjustable prongs made it a cinch to fit.<br /><br />I'm not really a mechanic, but I can't see why anyone would rather have a box full of specific sized lights.  This just seems so much better in that it's adjustable and all.
B000IYNAFU|4|Plugs right in and starts right up,,,,, but, my 1998 S-10 now has a slightly rough idle, not sure where my problems is yet. ( probably something I did wrong)
B000UVUAFO|1|They make this product look like it is all you need to repair scratches when actually you need some kind of epoxy to fill the scratch first (or that was what it sounded like to me in the directions, they weren't really clear!) I tried putting the solution on the scratch and rubbing it with the sandpaper they provided but it did absolutely nothing for the scratch. Not happy!
B002SSGANS|3|Had some clearance problems securing the camper and giving myself enough clearance so the fast guns would not rub the rear portion to the dually fender.  I had to reposition the camper securing point and move the rear mount tie-down out to it's farthest point, hopefully this will not cause a problem on our first outing.
B0058OU904|5|Very convenient.  Easy to use.  Placard is always within reach when needed.  3/1/2015  bought a new vehicle.  On newer model cars, sun visor is thick and elastic does not stretch enough.  Now I can use it.
B001EP281E|5|I installed this hitch on my 2010 Patriot.  Didn't have to jack up the car and didn't have to drop the exhust system. Angled into position and held one end with a jackstand.  It was a little difficult tightening the bolts in the confined space but can be done.  On the the 2010 Patriot you don't have to cut the rear bumper, just the reciever part sticks done from the bumper and looks nice.
B00EZ6VKIQ|5|Worked perfectly.
B000CSXIH2|5|received brought it for spare it look quality
B00JH6LC0U|5|good product
B001C6Q7HG|5|Aluminum pan that fit just like OEM for a fraction of the OEM cost??  Worried about \\"casting\\" problems but this pan had none and coming from China, that was a pleasant surprise for a change.
B000KL381W|5|fit as they should worked fine
B000I8YOR4|5|Heats tank in a fair amount of time,works great.
B003P64XU4|5|Our camper toilet  had a slight potty smell after a day of driving.  i replaced the caps on the 3 roof vents on our<br />Northern Lite camper and this vent cap seemed to help a lot in ridding the smell.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Worked great at 70+ mph. Did not get to test in rain.
B008QBTV5A|1|This thing was a piece of junk, power switch did not work right out of the box. Called Bell Automotive and they said I didn't buy it from them and to take it up with Amazon.
B0009JN2GG|4|great little  gadget has on off switch.
B002FDISWW|5|Bought this cable for my 2003 yamaha warrior 350 atv. The cable was a perfect for once I adjusted the length out properly. Now I've got seamless, easy clutch use again.
B00EE6KIS0|5|Well made,I sleep good knowing my trailer is protected with this lock fits most all  RV trailers.Would be very difficult to remove your not going to beat it off. pry it off or cut it off without a lot of hard work Outstanding Lock !!
B00J8S10TU|2|super bright and really cool for the 15min that they ran
B00HWI35A0|5|You need to buy red bulbs!!!. I ended up painting them with red caliper paint. They look great. Also no cover on the back of these so the wires are left exposed in the trunk.
B0041U3GLA|5|Perfect fit and delivered quickly
B00G25GOCA|4|Works as advertised.  Make sure you have a tight seal.  Great as a quick fix until you can actually get something prepared.  Nice to have on hand in a tool box.
B001D25YX2|5|Easy install, great price. I feel I definitely noticed an improvement in my engine's performance when I replaced my dirty filter. Very happy with the price and was delivered very quickly.
B000PCC9ZM|3|I bought this to replace the wheel lock key that got lost, unfortunately this set's key was millimeters too big to fit mine. The key for this set did NOT fit my 2006 Mini Cooper S with OEM wheel locks. I ended up having to go to a wheel shop and have them take off my old set and replace them with this set. So not a complete waste of money.
B002Z34UA6|5|It does seem to move more air than my old air gun.  However, the real plus of this air gun is the hand grip style and the hook that clips perfectly on the lip of my tool chest.  The pistol style hand grip is very comfortable and easy to control.
B001C6OZ48|5|Perfect stopped my rattling.
B006IVB7DO|2|Expected deeper sound, not worth my time of installing these
B008G2306U|5|THese lights look better than the Ford lights did in 1994, Their not a cheesey cheap plastic. Replacing these as-well as some new Silverstar ultra bulbs, people flash their brights at me when mine are dimmed already.ha Would recommend them to anyone looking to clean up their truck
B00D8RYGOI|5|Great light
B00I0O59YK|4|Too expensive
B008FOGE3U|5|The five pull-off strips to install the Bumper cover worked well.  Hint:  do this on a warm day and follow all instructions.  I also pulled the stips about two inches so they would stick out from under the cover while installing.
B00LLMJ142|5|Perfect
B00B8YREC4|5|keeps the panel behind the guard cleaner and looks like they belong on car..<br />Very nice product...  Clean look on the challenger
B006CRT72W|5|Easy to program my 2002 F 250.  Worked on the 2nd try - I was doing the 8 time cycle too slow.  Great product!
B008EG66BO|5|fits as expected
B00HS0GFU4|5|Great shocks for cheap. I recommend these to anyone.
B004R32TG4|4|easy install, I wish it was cheaper :(
B0085NS538|5|Not too dark,fit perfect and were super easy to install on my 2001 chevy tahoe.would recommend these to any one.
B003G6V6O4|5|Not too bright but works great and I like the white color far better than the the stock halogen lamp
B004UTA6BU|5|came on time and looks great went right on car with no issues wife loves it and so do i
B000CRAXNK|5|Ordered the lower and upper mounts and had no issues at all.  I read a few reviews stating that the product did not fit, but I had no such issue.  Literally unbolted the old one and replaced it. I performed the work on a 2006 PT Cruiser.  The rubber casting seems to be super solid, a lot better than the chrysler OE where they have a spoke design to the rubber casting.  The spoke design is prone to wear down faster due to only three absorption points.  This piece uses a solid rubber casting, which will hopefully last longer than the OE.  Credentials: 3 years shop mechanic/6 years backyard mechanic.
B007IONYCW|5|It's great bag works  great very durable! It's worth spending the extra
B008Y3UFLY|5|I  bought all twelve keys for my girlfriend and the are all lightweight and nice looking.
B00M1HUL9K|5|Really nice and fits our Jeep Grand Cherokee perfectly, just took forever to get here.
B005KLR0Q6|5|Grilles look great on my Hog!
B0007VM3DE|4|GOOD PRODUCT AND EXCELLENT PRICE. DELIVERY GOOD. HAD HARDWARE INCLUDED.
B0057DEKW4|5|Exactly as advertised.  My wife loves it. It looks great on the back of her SUV.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  Will come back for my next decal order
B0073WEZU4|1|Unfortunately, I got rid of the box, before I attempted to install this antenna so I don't know how to mail it back for my money back. Radio signal quality was worse than on the original antenna. To make it even worse, &#34;The Stubby Antenna&#34; fell apart when I had attempted to unscrew it - so I had to use pliers to remove the remaining part. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!
B004HRMC9O|5|Works as advertised. Very good quality for the price.
B005S09XUA|4|Fit perfect, no problems.
B000AP1MU2|5|Works great never have to replace it again.  Need to Grannysize my bike and re-jet then all will be well.
B005F5IYOE|5|Thank you!
B001G8AIMU|4|Good charger but no led or anything to tell if it's done. Good charger for the price tho!
B00IGZP2UE|1|This is required/recommended in all Subaru vehicles? A stop leak additive to hide a design defect? This is just a band aid  to cover up and hide a flaw within the engine design. 2009 Subaru=our worst investment ever!
B000KID31K|1|completely dis-satisfied. does not link with either of my pc's most of the time. took too long to recieve the product and customer supplort did not help at all with pc link up.
B0064IU5FW|5|Great product. A must have for anyone that owns an automatic Camaro SS. The AFM ( automatic fuel management) on my camaro was driving me nuts. Shutting off from 8 cylinders to 4, the going from 4 to 8 constantly, just had to get the right programmer to fix this issue. Very happy with my purchase of the Diablo sport I1000. Very easy to use. Now my camaro runs on straight 8 cylinders and no more cutting off to 4. Also, made a change to the transmission, for more firm shifts. My camaro runs like a true sports car now, and wow do you feel the difference. Anybody looking for a vehicle programmer, look no further than DiabloSport.
B002E59QDQ|5|Great replacement Filter. Performs at par with what came with the car. This is the second filter I bought from Amazon. The prices on amazon are lower than others
B005FM24WK|5|Took a couple trial runs but film is good quality and looks awesome!
B005PPZJHY|5|Very pretty :-)
B0082365AQ|5|It works perfect, Used it last week and found that I could tie it on the back of my kayak while we were cruising wolf bay and I did not have to return it to my car.  It was available when we returned from our kayaking and so simple to take everything back to my car.  By the way I have a snap together kayak and I just leave in together for hauling to and from rivers and lakes.
B0009JKGJC|5|Although I haven't purchased threw Amazon yet....just wanted to write review.<br />This turtle wax chrome cleaner is the best that I have used!!! ....and I've tried ALOT of different brands.<br />Make sure you let it dry to a &#34;haze&#34; and then polish it off.<br />I've compared this cleaner (polishing 1/2 side with turtlewax and other 1/2 with xxxx) to some of the best name brand chrome cleaner and still after 20+ yrs...I still find that turtle wax chrome cleaner gives the brightest and deepest shine hands down!!!<br /><br />I bought this back when it was $.99 a bottle!!! This cleaner does better than others I've paid $15.00 for! Amazing.<br />Oh....and with a little elbow grease.....it removes rust better than any others too!!!!
B00KU9A3GC|5|I bought these for my Jeep TJ (yes they do fit the Jeep TJ). I have purchased a couple of these and have some friends that have bought them too. All of us, and on mine have had an issue with the controller box. It is strange, but after time one will be slightly off from the other in color. The Seller does an outstanding job supporting these and has replaced my controller as well as my friends as needed. We only needed on replacement, so to me it seems like it is likely it was a bad batch of the controllers. The good news is that the controller is super easy to replace if it requires it and it is not a pain in the backside because you don't have to rewire everything or go into the headlights to do it!  Installation requires moderate skills and patience. Its not that it is difficult to do, its more that you can't rush the process.<br /><br />The following process worked for me: First I upgraded from sealed headlights in my TJ to a set of KC Hilite 7&#34; 55/60W H4 headlights (part #42311). This not only brightened up my old TJ headlights significantly, but also gave me a housing that I could remove the bulb and replace it (since the Angel Eyes will be epoxyed to the housing). Before I did anything else, I connected the Angel Eyes up to a 12 volt source to make sure they worked. I didn't want to tear into my headlights and do all the wiring and then find out they were bad. Next, I baked the housings in the oven on 350degrees for about 15-20 minutes.  I used a large cookie sheet with glass side down. The higher heat and time was more than the instructions called for, but I also had upgraded to a higher quality housing so the glue/etc. was better and it took more. Using a very small flathead screwdriver I pried the glass from the housing and separated them. I did a trial fitting of the Angel Eyes inside the housing and did this several times until I had them just the way I wanted and had the wire where I wanted it. I marked the spot and drilled two very small holes one each side of where the wire exited. Used a dremel to connect the holes and ran the wire out the back. Next I used JB Weld Clear Epoxy and popsicle sticks to epoxy the entire LED Angel Eye in place. Let it dry 24 hrs. Then I used clear liquid nails silicone (glass clear) and resealed the headlights. I tried heating them like the instructions said but I could never seem to get them hot enough to go back together and I definitely didn't want to damage the Angel Eyes w/heat. Let that dry 24 hrs with a brick or something pressing down on the headlight. After that just put the lights back in, wired it up and they work great.<br /><br />Even with the minor issue I encountered with the control box these things are so killer I give them 5 stars. They get looks everywhere I go. One last thing- the Police hate them and will pull you over for them in a heartbeat. You can tune the Yellow to an Amber to match the Amber turn signals so they are technically legal, but I guess it depends on the officer. Mostly they are used when the vehicle is parked and people walking by love checking them out. They are even in a lot of &#34;selfie&#34; shots I see all over the place, and I am like &#34;hey there's my Jeep&#34;.  I highly recommend these and Diode Dynamics!!!
B004ULDELW|5|I needed something to dress up a classic 1966 Thunderbird until I could find just the right rims for the car. These work great. You would never know they were plastic. Very easy to put on and they look classy and the fit is very secure. You can't beat them for the price.
B00C7Y9YAY|4|These look real nice however the adjustment screws are pretty cheap. Gotta be careful when adjusting, seem to work good for the most part otherwise.
B005HBA92Q|1|Go to a cummins or Cummins bridgeway close to you it's only 26 bucks
B0073VENUC|5|We have one Chevy Equinox and just ordered another one.  We wanted to put the new one into the garage and tried with the one we have - however, the standard antenna was too high and it wouldn't fit under the garage door.  We ordered the stubby and now the Equinox we have fits into the garage with room to spare - so now we know the new one will fit also. (They are the same size.) We tried the GPS, Sirius XM, OnStar, and the FM and AM.  They all work as good as they did.
B0092JLDIS|3|Nothing above and beyond.  Appears to be as described and arrived as promised.  Price is best I could find abet a bit much for a hunk of plastic.
B001U8QS9I|4|Very easy to figure out how to put on seats. There wasn't any directions sent, but there are several youtube demos to help you. These look really nice and update my car. Thank you.
B001KSDZBC|5|great  filter<br />If you want to buy the best filter on the world for your vehicle  look into mann catalog and you will never regret they just make perfect quality product<br />I use mann filters for a years
B0002STTQG|5|A couple of uses and this little gizmo paid for itself. This is a must have for doing electrical work on your vehicle connectors and such. I also purchased the Lisle 56500 Terminal Tool  to cover a range of terminals. Well pleased and would recommend for the DYI.
B00CDAHQYS|5|Fits like a glove! Great product! I would recommend buying from this seller!
B00I1BTCB8|5|good link
B005CO9FDW|4|great vacuum for a/c work! At this price, almost anyone can do a/c repair at home and save a ton from the shops. Vacs down to 25hg no problem and it's nice and quiet.
B005UO70ZO|5|Purchased 2nd time
B004I11182|4|I purchased the taillight to replace a damaged one on my Toyota Tacoma. The light works great as a replacement option. I have had no problems and installation is relatively simple. In terms of price you are saving a significant amount over going into the dealership to purchase either the entire assembly or even if you were to just purchase a new cover from a dealer. I cannot tell the difference between this brand and the toyota OEM. The materials are nearly identical.
B0006H938M|5|Works great
B00ZE1JMM2|5|This device is absolutely amazing! I was skeptical at first, but I did hear from a friend that all the dealers use it. I was in the market for a rare car and wanted an all original one with no paintwork. This thing SAVED ME! Well worth the investment! I checked out a car online, ran the carfax and autocheck, both which were clean and the owner told me its all original. So I drove 2 hours to check it out. Took the milPRO with me. The car looked great and I couldn't spot any bodywork with my eye. Upon inspection the rear quarter had readings of 30-40+ !!! The whole thing was smashed in! Clearly I avoided the car and saved myself a costly mistake!!
B00EAJO4DG|5|Works great
B0070Y36NC|5|love it
B00B36CBL6|5|it took 10 cans (a 6 pack + 4 from another 6 pack) but it looks great on the white inner surface of my plastic hardtop to my 2014 wrangler rubicon.  Its also a very good match to the flame red paint on the body, so for the price, it was a great way to paint my hard tops inner surface to better match my vehicle.<br /><br />Could not be easier to work with, shake it enough and it sprays well enough, keep a brush or rag handy and any splat spots you get due to not shaking enough between sprays can be leveled out while still wet, 15 mins between coats worked great, I used light coats and multiple coats to get coverage, and prep was super easy, only had to wash the rough plastic surface to make sure no oils were on it to prevent paint adhesion.<br /><br />Clean up was easily accomplished on areas paint wasnt wanted with rubbing alc while still tacky, nail polish remover and laquer thinner once it was fully dry an hardened over a week later.
B00390BS7C|5|The tool is very sturdy and more than adequate to remove original pre-cat sensors after 10+ years, circa 100k miles. Has a quality feel that belies its low cost.<br /><br />On these cars, a spanner wrench _almost_ works, but is extremely awkward. Using this tool makes the job simple.<br /><br />Do use a quality penetrating oil first, on a cold exhaust system, and let it sit a while first. But you knew that.<br /><br />PS: on super tough O2 sensors that won't come out, many mechanics suggest cutting the sensor's cable and using a box wrench or six point socket, which in theory will be stronger and give maximum torque. With this tool I cannot imagine that coming into play very often.
B00ISKSOB6|4|Meguiar's has alwats had a good product.
B000NKCIXE|5|works well

B007MM9HNU|4|Pros: do the job easy, maintain battery and charge it.<br /><br />cons: if the battery its below certain charge, it will not charge it at all.<br /><br />my solution a pair of auxiliary cables and connect in series with another functional battery.<br /><br />I have 6 motorcycles and work.
B004WPQZTE|4|Fits the 2010 Thruxton pretty well and is almost in every way identical to the original mirror (the unlike part is not seen).
B005JDT0GS|5|Now I can hear my music, where as before and probably because of the loudness of my Dyna super glide. Thanks Amazon
B003VZLJFG|5|After 10 years with a yellow headlight lens, I decide to do something. I purshase this xrain product because it was on sale and based on the amazon reviews (I used this side as reference) all the time. 1st take your time read the instruction in the back of the box or see some you tube videos, 2th park your car in a shaded area, 3th take a seat with you, 4th 5-10 minutes later you have new headlight. I have some amazing before and after photos.
B005LLL2HI|5|The wiper blade fits the rear window wiper of my 2009 Prius perfectly. I changed it myself. The blade cleans the windows with no smears or lines. I'll be back when it's time to replace this one.
B00DBENCMK|4|They look good on my truck
B000E2CVDI|5|Good product, excellent quality for a reasonable price, I found the product I needed for my bike, I hope to acquire more products of this type. Thank you.
B004JO3U0U|5|This is my second set of Monster Mats.  I got four years out of the first set.  The floor mats fit perfectly in my 2009 Passat.  These mats are the best ones out there.
B0002U1TXK|3|NOTE TO DARK COLOR CAR OWNERS: If you have a dark colored car and apply to trim above paint get ready for some nasty streaks to form on your paint (they do come off with some effort but it is a real pain). I have a black car and have lots of trim parts above painted surfaces and it looks like hell after it rains. On my other car which is silver, this is a non-issue.
B000WLEIM8|5|Medium fits well and I actually like that this doesn't bunch up too much. I am an athletic fit with somewhat broad shoulders and a 32&#34; waist. Overall feels solid and durable. The zipper was a little finicky but I rubbed it with some soap to lubricate it a little and working well now.
B008LZK1IW|3|I like the color, but these are a lot dimmer than stock. There are other brighter options out there, and you'd be better to use them.
B004O5DSOM|5|This New Driver Magnet makes life SO much easier! I'm pretty sure it's not my imagination, but on using this the frequency of angry honks and dirty looks did go down :) It sticks really well. Even when the car is rubbed and scrubbed it stays put. Recommended!
B000HLYQWK|4|Top is great. I wish it would stay tighter across the back though.
B00LR9YUT0|5|Good selae thank you
B009DJT1CC|5|Great item-  got here on time, the molding was super accurate - the holes lined up perfectly , the shield is a bit thinner then OEM , but gets the Job done.<br /><br />Def rec
B002IT9KZ2|1|I received the bells and was very disappointed that they came discolored as though they had been on the shelf for ages, not to mentioned they had rust spots on them.
B000NWA8M0|1|Junk they break. Wife broke two
B00BVL7W1C|2|The material of the rim protector is soft. It doesn't stand up to tire lever prying and they break and tear easily.
B004JL7N2E|2|These straps are not what I'd call heavy duty. The original straps that came with the dolly were three times as thick as these.
B001MOSBRW|5|I received on time! and it work perfect. The installation was really easy. I definitely will buy here again if need it..
B001H25T7E|4|It is a loose fit -- could have been slightly wider to fit more securely.  Otherwise, however, it does the job,  And as someone earlier said, &#34;med. charcoal&#34; is actually black!
B006LO676U|5|good product
B0006I0O4I|3|set screw a little small.
B00BFLVVU6|4|I didn't have any problem with the battery acid installation. It seemed well-designed. I've used it unconventionally so I cannot speak to its life in the Honda Hornet I purchased it for.
B001AL7GOQ|5|I found this baby book at babys R us, and my step daughter wanted to get it for our new arrival. I was happy to find it on here for a much cheaper price. its full of lots of great things to write down for the future!
B000UEHZG8|5|Exactly
B0032YV1T0|5|Smells great. My babies would get rashy skin from using J&J baby wash with its fragrance and chemicals. No more with this soap. A little pricey, but found that if you use a loofah it lathers wonderfully for less waste. I have 3 babies and still have a little less than half the bottle after about 6 months. So, not too bad for roughly a year's supply.
B007HAHZGI|5|So happy with the stroller.  This stroller is so lightweight and collapses to smaller than my travel system Graco stroller.  My kids are thrilled that they each have their own seat and cup holder!  Really easy to set-up and collapse.  The only downside is that when collapsed, the fabric touches the ground/floor...but it is the underside so it's not too big of a deal.  The pop of red on the black looks great too!  I think it is a wonderful value and will work out just perfect for our trip to Disney and any subsequent trips to the zoo, park, or just going to walks.  This is the sit and strand stroller to buy!!!!
B00PL1KVV6|5|MUST HAVE! My husband is a stay at home dad with our twin 1 year olds. Meal times are cleaner and more organized now. The kids actually have to pick food pieces up and out of the compartments rather then swiping it all onto their laps or the floor.
B007HKOL8S|5|We used the Avent classic five years ago and upgraded to the Natural with this baby.  They no longer leak and the medium flow is perfect for 3 months plus.  My little man is nearly five months and still going strong with the medium flow (#3) nipples.
B00009IMCK|5|this was a much appreciated gift
B001O0BK18|5|We bought this mattress to fit in the Graco Lauren crib and it fits PERFECTLY! The mattress had no smell and is labeled as to which side is the latex (for toddlers) vs. soy foam (for infants). Since we got this mattress, our baby has been sleeping MUCH more soundly, and even through the night on a much more consistent basis! (Her old mattress was a hand-me-down Sealy with springs.) The mattress was delivered in a nice box that fit it just right. She does not get sweaty or hot from the foam, which was a minor concern of mine. I am VERY pleased with this mattress, which is made in the USA, and would DEFINITELY recommend it!     I was a little nervous because it said that I would be emailed when they would become available to ship, but I got the mattress within 5 days of ordering.    As a side note, I was also looking into the Sealy Soy-foam core, which is cheaper, but am glad I bought this one...the latex side is softer and meant for toddlers, so hopefully we won't be buying a new mattress until she needs a twin-sized bed or bigger.
B003ZJV68I|5|Works great
B00004TFLB|2|So, first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them (but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes. To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once, which I find annoying. Overall my LO doesn't seem too interested in it just yet.
B003XMWFAU|5|***UPDATE: 5 MONTHS LATER***<br /><br />Still work perfectly after a lot of abuse. Kids pushing strollers, jumping out unexpectedly, climbing on the links, you name it. Still like the day we bought them.<br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW***<br /><br />Fantastic idea by the Munchkin folks. Easily converted my 2 BRU strollers into a double. My brother got two packs to make a triple umbrella for himself. My strollers had different size wheels, but that didn't matter one bit. Gets a little dicey when doing serious off-roading, but other than that these are great!
B002SG7JSU|4|I kept hitting the corner of my desk because the space around it is narrow.  I got tired of always having a big bruise on my leg & got these.  They have stayed on very well & provide good cushioning.  They also remind me to avoid the corners.  Either way I'm happy!!
B004HFQOLS|5|I absolutely loved this pump. I bought it in october of 2011 after trying to breastfeed my daughter exclusively for 2 months. After I had researched several high priced pumps, and after trying a certain brand name pump, I stumbled upon the reviews for this much less expensive one, Not only were the reviews glowing for this pump, but after buying it I felt the need to review it myself. It was a much better pump than the more expensive brand name one I tried. I used this pump for about 8 months before storing it for my next baby. From the very first use I loved it. Being able to set my own rhythm was the best feature. I was able to pump so much and start storing which helped me because now my husband could help feed the baby. It was easy to assemble, and came in a very nice travel bag, with so many extra pieces in case you lost anything. After my daughter began solid foods I stored my pump away until I had my last baby on july 2nd 2013. I tried using it today but it somehow has malfunctioned and wont pump. I called avent to troubleshoot, I assumed my warranty was expired, it was supposed to be one year, but after all the troubleshooting the representative looked up my serial number and told me I was being sent a new pump! The rep was very nice, and very helpful. The only drawback is that the pump is going to take 3-4 days to get here because according to avent they have been using overnight shipping but the usps has been taking that long to deliver it, though I can't complain because I am getting a new pump free of charge unexpectedly. Another plus is that this pump is a closed system pump, which means as long as you sterilise it, buying it used isn't a problem, or reselling it as well.
B0002XO5G0|5|easy to use and cost-effective! you can use it under arms, in mouth, rectal for baby....good product and smart design very low price!
B004G8QMZY|4|I love this product. I have used it since he was 6 months. I wish the would do an early waker sleepsack in cotton.
B000GEM3V4|5|I really like this mattress. I did a lot of research and I was very confident in my final decision when purchasing this mattress for our baby. The mattress is very firm, fits snug in our crib, and sheets fit it well. When I was researching mattresses I liked the fact that this mattress does not have a metal frame that toddlers can use to help them climb out of their cribs. I also liked that I did not have to purchase a mattress pad to protect the mattress because of the welded seems. I am able to just wipe the mattress down if my baby spits-up or has a diaper leak. The mattress can get cold without a mattress pad, but it's my choice not to use one. My baby started rolling very early and prefers to sleep on his tummy. I have some peace of mind that he's at least  sleeping on a nice firm mattress.
B000E9TANA|4|Fit well after first washing.  Standard thickness mattress pad.  Softness was good.  I was please with this purchase and would recommend.
B008VWGVPM|5|Nothing better to encourage toilet training than the gleeful, if sometimes, annoying to adults, sounds of cheering!
B003CLIGX2|5|I bought this for my wife while she was pregnant, and it works pretty well.  It seems to be best to have a small mp3 player, but this belt works with any device that uses a standard 3.5mm audio jack.  The belt has a volume control on the audio wire itself for even better volume control.  The baby was definitely responsive to the music in the womb, and we play the same iPod with the same content (we used all classical music like Bach, Beethoven, etc) now that he's been born and we've already found that he actually likes music.  We're glad we purchased and used this belt and would use it again.
B00438SCB4|1|When i bought it I thought this will be a cover for the chair, a real cover, not just a blanket with elastic to hold it to the chair.  not happy at all. It looks like a big bib for the chair. False publicity
B002L3T9VA|5|Another fav baby toy for my 4month old! Highly recommend!
B00B507EQW|5|Came from a Britax Marathon, and my 3 year old loves this seat.  Tried putting him back in the Marathon in our other car, and he was not happy... Says the Recaro is much more comfortable, and for the money it was actually cheaper than what we were looking at for the next Britax.  Love this seat!!  Only knock is that I would like the cup holders to be a little easier for him to use on his own.  The elastic is a little tight, requiring two hands to use the pockets.
B001BPQZ2K|5|My son hated the previous peanut sling and snuggie sling that I bought. He would only calm down and sleep when I carried him around. Because I have a two years old too having my hands full with a newborn was not so easy. I thought I would try the sleepy wrap as a last ditch effort to make it easier to carrie my son and still have my hands free to play with my oldest son. I have to say I am very pleased with this sling. My son loves it, it is soft, does not hurt the carrier by poking or pulling, there are no annoying clips or straps to worry about and it is a great price. I am buying on for my cousins baby shower next!
B0082IYMYM|5|Our twins seem to bump into everything when they are having a good time.<br /><br />We bought these cushions because they came in a 16 piece value pack and most companies we saw on Amazon sell just a 4 pack, so we saved money because we need quite a few of these cushions.  So far we are really happy with them.  They stick on easily and stay on tight.<br /><br />The colors are good too.  The brown color goes well with our dark furniture, and the oyster color which is like a soft cream color goes well with our light furniture.  Some friends suggested we get clear cushions for our wooden table.  I think those are mostly for glass tables but I'm glad that we didn't get them because they are too shiny and would probably attract our kid's attention.  The kids hardly notice these new cushions.<br /><br />I wish I had bought these several months ago so that I would feel more comfortable having the kids run around.
B004RCOPJE|5|It's a life saver in terms of a mothers milk nursing babies, the baby replay to the battles immediately. It is very comfortable.
B004P1IUT8|5|Very cute!
B00005C1JP|5|We use this in school so doors can be locked at all times but easily pulled closed if needed.  Only problem is if a door is especially heavy it does not hold up long.
B002F9MV88|4|THESE ARE THE BEST BIBS EVER!!! KEEPS BABY'S NECK AND CLOTHING DRY, AND THE TERRY BACK KEEPS BABY FROM SWEATING AND BIB STICKING TO SKIN!!, WHEN ONE SIDE GETS DIRTY THEN IF DRY, IT CAN BE REVERSED TO THE OTHER, CLEAN SIDE.  I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS IF IT CAME IN BIGGER NECK SIZE OR THE VELCRO WAS MADE WHERE THE NECK SIZE CAN BE ADJUSTABLE, AND IF THE PRICE WAS A BIT LESS, BUT HEY, THEY ARE GREAT BIBS SO I DONT MIND PAYING MORE.  GREAT VELCRO TOO, HOLDS VERY STRONG WASH AFTER WASH... JUST MAKE SURE TO CLOSE IT BEFORE WASHING AND DRYING OR IT WILL CATCH AND HOLD ON TO JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING, ITS THAT STRONG.  LUV IT!
B0033P1Q2A|1|This is wrong on so many levels!  I can't begin to describe how unsafe this is.  There is a reason why the state licensing department does not allow childcare providers to prop bottles.  Ugg...I am sorry but I came across this product and immediately was disgusted.  I have cared for multiples and you can easily do so without propping bottles.  It may take a little patience on the caregivers part and a great routine for the babies but it is possible.  If you have multiples there are ways to position them and feed two at once allowing for proper feeding techniques and loving human interaction.
B00AJSJCAW|3|For $19.99 it's just okay.  It works and baby seems to like it.  My biggest beef with this thing is the noise from the spring rubbing on the cloth rope and the plastic shield surrounding it.  It's pretty noisy once baby gets going.  You would of thought they could of perfected these things by now but I guess I'll try and make my $20 baby jumper better with a little home fixing.
B000FFL58Q|5|The baby loved it.
B00B1SUCEY|5|I really am into cupcake things for my baby!!<br />It is easy to use and goes well with all of her pacifiers.<br />Item came as pictured.
B000I2Q0F4|5|My 5 month old LOVE this, she is so entertained most of the time she puts it in her mouth but she loves the different noises the rattle-ling and the crackling. She also loves the mirror  .
B002Q4TWD4|5|I absolutely love this sling! I have it in two styles, and would LOVE to get just one more! It fits beautifully, and washes well. Throw it in the washer, and hang it up to dry, no need to iron or anything...<br />As for fit, this sling is designed for young babies, and I think the issue with the other reviewer is that her sling didn't fit her own body. I wear a size 10 or 12, am 5'11\\", and I'm very large busted, so I went with the large. It should fit so that your baby isn't down around your hip, but snugly against your bust. Just make sure you follow the sizing chart!<br />I LOVE this sling! You will too!
B00005QI1G|5|This has been a lifesaver... my 5 week old loves it to soothe her to sleep or to prop her up while you go about your business while watching her.  I thought I wouldn't be able to use this right away but I was wrong!  Take off the play bar and use the vibrating seat mode and my newborn is in heaven.  It has saved our sanity as our baby has slight colic.  It's great at helping her to releave her gas pains, too!  I buy this product for all my new mom-to-be friends because I think it's a MUST HAVE!  I can't wait for her to graduate into using it for play!
B004G8QN7G|5|There are a great, safe way to keep baby a little warmer at night.  I have purchased several of them- a few cotton, and a few in the fleece for when it is colder.  Tried another brand and didn't like it as well, so we will go back to these!
B00BXE5M46|5|My daughter loves them. Just be careful with the lid because it seems to get moldy easy if not cleaned thoroughly
B00GY04984|5|I got this for my daughters birthday and it is awesome. She loves it! I try to keep bath time fun and this totally did the trick.
B00V99EEYY|5|So glad that I bought this product...I have washed it several times and it still looks and feels brand new.
B005KHYPCC|5|We have had these beds for a few weeks now and love them.  We purchased them for our 3 and 5 year old's and they are perfect for them .  The only thing that I would like to see is a little more support on the bottom, It is ok for them seeings though they are still small and somewhat lite weight but for any one over 150 I would suggest putting a middle support beam.  We have not put them into bunk beds yet as they are still a bit too young to be on the top bunk right now so I am not sure how they will do in the bunk but as two twin beds they are perfect for what we wanted and I love the color! I also loved the price, all other twin beds we were looking at were at least 150 per bed.
B00913CZ64|4|My kid has all Owl character products and she loves this bottle.  It is easy to use, easy to handle and easy to clean!
B005WPP8CS|4|Looks cute and I love the elastic around the back of the carseat, but the quality isn't the best. The fabric is thin and I worry about it breaking where the loops go around the carseat handle. But it's much better than my carseat cover without the elastic around the bottom though, since this one actually stays on the carseat and doesn't touch the floor everytime I put the carseat down.
B005PK1FY0|5|US strollers only have the upper cover for the sun, they are not adjustable so your child will get sun at some point.  This umbrella helped us keep the sun out of our 7 month old's face when we went to Europe last summer.  It's adjust, so you can point it directly to the sun.  It's also a great way to protect from wind.
B00CQBMPF4|5|The look online the the exact appearance you will receive.  What I don't like is the way the decal have to be applied to the wall.  But my son love this decal.
B004FMAMNY|5|This is my second Infantino carrier and I think it's great for the price and comfort.  My baby who is 7 weeks feel right asleep.  I've read a few articles about having baby, while still developing, be set in their carriers in an ergo friendly position, so they don't develop his displaysia.<br /><br />I think this carrier will do the trick!
B004CSNFVC|5|This diaper is fantastic. Fit my 6lb 10oz newborn perfectly. Has contained everything. It's the only one my husband will put on our baby because it has significantly out-performed other brands of newborn diapers. My only problem is that the layer that touches baby's skin feels dry even when the diaper is soaked, so it's sometimes hard to tell if a change is needed - this is a good thing for baby, but makes my job a little harder. The other issue I have had intermittently (not bad enough to stop using them) is a lingering mildew-y smell. None of my other cloth diapers have this issue. Maybe because they are so thick they retain some moisture or maybe my HE machine isn't able to completely penetrate the layers...not sure what the problem is.  Update: I have no idea how these would ever fit a 12lb baby!! I was able to use them until baby was approx 9.5lbs - after that they were too tight around both his waist and thighs. For reference, he is 50th percentile for weight and 75th percentile for length.
B00BFXU7D6|5|Great for a starter Trophy Rack...son has so many that I need a bigger one! Very easy to put together and very sturdy
B0017U2LF4|4|Really like the quality of this sweatshirt but the sizing was on the small side. Wish it was a bit more true to size so that my grandson would be able to wear it longer, barley fits him even though I just purchased it. Most items from other brands that are this same size are still too big for him. Becasue of the quality I would consider ordering this brand again but will know to jump up a one or maybe even two sizes.
B001OOCFWW|5|The Ergo Baby Carrier was excellent and I used it until my granddaughter outgrew it.  It was built well and in good condition when I passed it on to another baby.
B00EFQXDWW|5|Got these for my first son and liked them so much I got another pair for baby #2. Makes cutting tiny little nails so much easier! Definitely recommend.
B0083SXALM|3|It's very cute. However, my daughter is 2 and she can't pull the plunger back or push it to squirt the water. It's way to hard. She's not strong enough.
B004DS14B4|5|Its big and easy to clean, but the baby squeezes it and alot of the food comes out, as she gets bigger and is more aware this will work better, its a great size and VERY easy to fill!
B0057NUK2I|5|Great for bringing in groceries with my rollator.
B002SW3CK8|5|These were definitely more costly than an 8 pack of terry washcloths.  They are so soft and lightweight.  I can use them and I know they will be gentle enough for my baby's bath.
B002J4U8L6|5|A wonderful gift for my baby. She has enjoyed teething on her older sisters' photo books so I know she'll enjoy her own pictures and teething on her own book too! :)
B00N3K4HP8|5|Quick and easy shipping.  The pillow is soft and fluffy. The pillowcase fits nicely as well. I'm going to enjoy this while I'm traveling!
B00BKXEJGC|5|I brought a baby bjorn for my son and i order this for my second bathroom. This is almost exactly the same as the baby bjorn but much cheaper. I definitely recommend this over the baby bjorn since both serve the same purpose but one is 20 bucks cheaper.
B0007A2GX2|5|This is one of the best toys ever...we are adopting so I don't know how my daughter will like it but I have almost worn the batteries down playing with it.  I am a first time mom and have been so frustrated with the toys for sale...I say to myself - this isn't challenging enough!  This is so cute and the melodies are relaxing - not annoying like most!  Great job Lamaze!
B00B07STAK|4|Love it! Only cons are that it's not the best on gravel or dirt. And the storage compartment is pretty much worthless when the car seat is clicked in. Can't easily access it. Other t u an that, it's great. Easy to fold down, smooth on flat surfaces, good quality.
B0038W0RI2|4|I really like using these \\"sleep sacks\\" to keep my baby warm at night.  Using these, you don't have to dress your baby in long pants which saves alot of time and energy during middle of the night diaper changes.
B001LIQ018|2|Simply, just didn't work for our kid. If you just hold out for a few months, you kid's mouth gets stronger and larger; ours just eventually learned how to suck from a bottle on her own with time and patience.
B004GCJMLG|5|These are as good as they come.  Wish we could find a better device to do this function that doesn't break.
B004AKZFB0|5|It matches all the rest of her bedding and accessories. She loves to hang her pictures & her little notes on it stylishly without any holes in the walls. It also stylishly matches the rest of the rooms decor.
B0064ZM7OM|5|works great
B0033OG86K|4|Excellent for picnic or the beach. Water resistant and can easily folded up into a pouch for easy transportation. The size is pretty good for a couple and a baby
B00002JV9S|5|This was a favorite as soon as my son figured out that when he would bite it, it would vibrate. It either is really soothing or he just likes how it feels or something because hes 10mo old now and he still loves it...! Handle is great to put links around also to attach it to stroller or carseat! When it vibrates the little green/red spinner part on the bottom kind of &#34;chatters&#34; around, but its not too annoying. It's a distinct sound, if i am driving i can hear if hes chewing on this thing ;)
B0067GKHQS|3|I like this thing, but it definitely could've been designed a little bit better.<br /><br />First of all, I use this and don't have a baby. I like to have wipes handy to wash my face with in the morning, or other random beauty uses. It's something my mom always did, and I picked up the habit from her. So I'd really like OXO to make an option to just get an all-white one of these, but neither color choice fit with the decor of my bathroom or vanity area.<br /><br />But my biggest problem with it is that it doesn't keep the wipes moist enough! If you have a baby and use this all the time, it'll work perfectly. But for somebody like me who occasionally goes a day or two without opening it, I'll often have to throw the top one away because it's become dry.<br /><br />I do love that you can use this thing with one hand, though, and I like that it looks better in my bathroom than one of those plastic cases they originally come in.<br /><br />So, bottom line, this is an excellent product for parents, but if you're not using it for diaper changing, it does have some design flaws.
B000066CMV|2|Although very impressed in the beginning with this product, I was very unhappy when the pump broke less than three weeks after I started using it.  However, I bought another one since it was still cheaper than the Medela and I had been able to pump eight ounces in about 20 minutes.  I tried to be very careful the next time around, but the second time was not the charm and the same part broke yet again.  I e-mailed the company, as I read from others who had the same problem that they received great help in getting replacement parts sent to them so quickly.  It has been four business days and no response, so second e-mail was sent.  If you have the money to keep buying pumps when one breaks, this is the one for you- otherwise you might want to save yourself time and headache and go for the electric
B00H8MQ7XC|5|Gave as a gift but was told this was the stroller to get because of all the options.
B0045Y15BA|5|My 14 month old grandson loves this! When open he makes himself comfy and takes his books and is quite happy!
B004LKS96C|5|I highly recommend this item.  My daughter has been laying on this for much of the day since she came home from the hospital.  She is 10 weeks now.<br /><br />This thing is really well made and easy to deploy.  We bought this one after testing the padding of about 20 in different stores and finding this model to have the best.  The pad is perfect.  Some pack n plays have sharp edges in the pad where the bottom particle boards overlap, this one does not.  It has 2 long metal rods underneath the boards underneath the pad.. so it all holds together very very well.  There is no dipping for my 8 pound little girl in the centre in bassinet mode.  The flimsy shelf on the side is stronger than I thought it would be and  is also very well made.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The changing table is very slanted.  This is by poor design, not a defective unit.  It is VERY sturdy though at least.  I keep a little blanket on the left side so my little girl doesn't slide into the side of it because it is a good 8 degree incline.<br /><br />The mobile is complete junk.  It doesn't attach tightly, it doesn't spin, there is no logical way for you to spin it yourself....  but at least the stuffed animals on it are cute.
B004FI9AUY|4|These lights work - however they are not as bright as I thought they would be so I bought an additional set. Great product for the price.
B001IA2XGK|5|Loved this cloth wipes. Cleans very well. I don't usually have to pre-wash before I throw it into my washer. I have told other mommy friends to order this wipe instead.
B007BYN460|2|Doesn't play any music.  Both the green and red buttons only make it spin.  Not much else to say.  Does not work as advertised.
B00AJSIXWK|1|Cheap quality. Not easy for baby to sleep . I like the easy instructions on how to secure into the car
B00YB67E12|5|I looove it
B008IGTMXY|3|its great for toddler drinks, but then after 2 months the straw inside starts to get loose and would have to fix it from the inside or if she was drinking and raises the bottle it would fall inside and have to remove the cap and fix it, other than that hassle its great. maybe if they made it all into one piece it would be better.
B008VWIYA2|5|Travel toilet seat perfect for my needs!  Will recommend !
B001WAJVZM|3|easily pulls forward unless absolutely tightened. Hard to tighten.  (though not completely off the faucet). works with a standard tub with top-shower pull.
B009T6GDI4|5|good
B00CXSPL24|1|If by universal fit means does not work with the number one selling breast-pump in the country, then here's your answer.
B002W5V8D4|5|I really liked this item.  I purchased it as a photo prop for my little boy's newborn photos but now plan on using it as decoration in his room.  It is a nice size and made from decent material.  Does not look cheap at all.
B000MVQBG4|5|Love that it is adjustable by a lot.
