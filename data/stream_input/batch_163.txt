B00003CX7L|3.0|It is really good, the best film my mate has ever seen, I didn't like it that much but it doesn't matter what I put.  This film has helped the local shops by selling the toys, butwho cares.  It isn't complete garbage, but it  gets very close.  Tom Hanks as Woody was fairly funny though, so I will forgive them for the shocking storyline and the awful cameo voice over by Andy Peters, that may have been there biggest mistake, he sounded completely fake.  Anyway i has been very sucessful so there must have been something amazing that I missed, this iswhy I gave it 3 stars instead of 1.
B00005BL2A|2.0|i loved there ultra album this album has some beautiful poems but lacks the energy of ultra it doesn't rock! ok, some tracks are moving and his voice is great but it doesn't stand out saying i want here that again except for maybe &quot;i feel loved&quot; with the trance/techno explosion going on and them being the grandaddies of some techno sounds they could of sold more albums with some more techno/trance sounding tunes maybe that isn't what they wanted anyway maybe its will grow on me?  i know Martin  gore has suffered to be able to write such lyrics don't worry it all about growing and some times it hurts as you say like all soul sisters/brothers bruce gilling
B00005LMBK|5.0|I purchased the CD this morning, and although I haven't finished listening to it, I'm already impressed with the album. For those of you who heard the single &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, don't expect the CD to be the rap of Russel (Del the funky homosapien), because he only does so on one other song, and that's &quot;Rock the House.&quot; <br />They lyrics are decent, as is the singing from 2-D (Adrian), but music itself really shines. The beats are catchy, and you'll find yourself more than one occasion bobbing your head along with them. <br />While unorthodox, the Gorillaz CD proves to be quite enjoyable and an interesting blend of several styles.
B00003CXAA|1.0|I have a tape of the cronological blend of 1 and 2, film does not get any better.  I wouldn't walk across the street to get 3 for free, it was and is something that should have never been released.  I can understand about wanting the flash backs in 1 and 2 but the blend is in a class by it's self, no other movie/s made is in the same league, too bad the ego is in the way and he will not put the best out.  Hopefully someone will make it in spite of him and I will buy it as my tape has seen better days.  For those of you that have not seen the blend of 1 and 2 I feel sorry for you deeply deeply sorry, you know not what you are missing and this box set is just a box compared to the blend.
B000059HAI|5.0|The increased awareness of the bombing of Pearl Harbor among a new generation should be rewarded with a viewing of this film,as opposed to the current video game version.  Is Pearl Harbor really the appropriate historical event to detail a mushy, who cares romance?  The film makers here knew it was not.  They adhered to the tension and the events that led up to the declaration/misinformation of war due to the decreased technological advances of communication of the time.  This is an important lesson and it shows how War is definitely a problem of communication more than anything else. There is no need to remake this movie as it stands on its own as entertaining history.  It should be viewed by everyone.
0790729628|3.0|I am a Blade Runner fan. I have an old vcr version. I have seen the 'Director's Cut' on the big screen. It is a huge disappointment. Harrison Ford's narration was added to the released version because the 'Director's Cut' was too unclear on what was going on. The great narration of the Blade Runner was added after looking at the Director's Cut. They knew, and rightly so that the movie would flop without the verbal support from Harrison Ford. His explainations make this a great film. I would really like to get a DVD of the original movie released version.

0441008356|4.0|\\"Revelation Space: a quest for the secrets of the universe. Step into infinity and join the ride of the century.\\" (from Revelation Space backcover.)<br />And what a ride it was. Starting slowly at first but with the no less gripping intrigues of power struggles Machiavellian in their scope on Resurgam, the planet where the story begins. Revelation Space is woven around an archaeological dig of a long past civilisation, the Amarantins and the novel's main character, Dan Sylveste.<br />Who were the Amarantins, and why did their civilisation cease some nine hundred thousand years ago seemingly in an instant in historical terms? Revelation Space is a look into the possibilities for the human race over 500 years in the future, where electronic implants are not only possible but also the norm, where space ships travel at near the speed of light, and where life can be prolonged almost indefinitely.<br />Every time I thought the story had crested, some new twist and turn occurred. Even though half way through this 476-page novel, the two story lines came together there was obviously much more of the plot to unravel. About two-thirds into the story I couldn't put the book down, eagerly turning the page to see what new part of the story would be revealed.<br />I rate this book highly, and recommend it to all science fiction fans. Although certainly not of the scope and depth of the \\"Foundation\\" series of Asimov, it nonetheless was truly a \\"huge, magnificent space opera...\\"
B0000062GE|5.0|This is it. In my eyes, this is Stabbing Westward's best album to date. This album has always held a special meaning to me in that it always seemed to be playing during some of the most difficult moments in my life between June 1998 and September 1999. Whenever I heard Christopher Hall yell, &quot;I hate my darkest days,&quot; I knew exactly how he felt. Cigarettes were chainsmoked and tears were shed will listening to this album.  Now I appreciate this album even more. The misery, self-loathing and anguish of the beginning is balanced with the gentle sorrow of the later tracks. The opening title track and Everything I Touch made me feel like I was backed into a corner while Desperate Now and especially Waking Up Beside You bring me a sense of submission, the pain has numbed me and made me want to lie down.  I enjoy the new sound of their self-titled release but Darkest Days will always stand out as something I held close to get me through rough times.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This is an amazing CD.  It is the most creative bit of music that I have heard in a long time.  David Albom was right to stay away from the traditional solo project fare and step out on limb.  The highlights of the CD are the tracks featuring Del tha Funkee Homosapein.  He is the best MC out there and this album exposes him to a whole new audience.  Every track is different and the CD is fresh and fun.
B00005B4GU|5.0|....Me & many other people on the other hand are happy with the musical transition the band has accomplished, knowing that OK Computer #2 would've been much more disillusioning than Kid A or Amnesiac seeing that a masterpiece reminiscent of OKC comes around only once in an epoch. This album won't be easy to people who aren't familiar with Kid A, but for the ones who are it'll incontrovertibly reflect as its brighter side. ...Radiohead are my favourite band but also seeing that every track here deserves it ...-<br />\\"Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box\\"- The incessant, hardtofllow drumbeats & electronic effects might give you the first impression that this is \\"Idioteque\\" part two, however Thom's vocals sounds tranquil + welcoming & the melody is- You're not gonna believe this- really catchy. Don't worry, of course Radiohead didn't start writing Britney Spearsish songs, it's just that this song is in point of fact rather hummable as opposed to many of Radiohead's other songs.<br />\\"Pyramid Song\\"- The first single off of this album is enforced by mesmerizing strings, dainty pianochords & what appears to be an impossible rhythm. The lyrics which refer to a dreamy, otherworldy experience make the song sound hopeful & even happy, not \\"gloomy\\" as many people here said. You've gotta love it.<br />\\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\"- The weakest track on the album ...however fortunately the electronic beat combined with Thom's distorted vocals prevent it from becoming dull. ....<br />\\"You And Whose Army?\\"- The piano (& Thom's voice too actually) have this hollow, jazzy feel to it which is nice + the chordprogression is really cool. The part where the rest of the band joins in sorta sounds like Kid A meets OKC (Only in a way though)- Neat.<br />\\"I Might Be Wrong\\"- Incontrovertibly one of the best songs on the album. An irresistible & very very VERY hooky guitarriff plays throughout most of the song, @ times actually manages to conceal bits & pieces of the chorus' beautiful melody. The part @ the end where you think the song is over but then the guitar/organ comes back in is superb, reminds me of stuff on Blur's last album 13.<br />\\"Knives Out\\"- The band said that they worked on this song for 373 (!) hours. Apparently you won't get this feeling listening to it, though the distinctive piano sounds a lot like the first guitar bit on \\"Paranoid Android\\". The lyrics which would under other circumstances sound appalling flow perfectly within the unforeseeable melody & that bit in the middle where Thom stops singing sounds kinda creepy (Though I think it's only me).<br />\\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\"- This version really differs from the Kid A one. The 10/8 drumbeat is gone, substituted by what sounds like actual bells. The \\"Cut the kids in half\\" part sounds much better here.<br />\\"Dollars And Cents\\"- Another strong point. The eerie arrangement doesn't mutilate the powerful melody Thom is singing, one of the best ones the band ever wrote. The lyrics, even if still fairly ambiguous, work flawlessly here, @ points even reminds you of that exultant angst we all felt whilst singing along to songs like \\"Airbag\\", \\"Paranoid Android\\" or \\"Electioneering\\". This song is essential.<br />\\"Hunting Bears\\"- This track will really surprise you. If you already know that this is an instrumental & expecting another indistinct \\"Treefingers\\" then prepare to be astounded. This guitar/organ interlude is really marvellous + it only lasts for two minutes (As opposed to the static, stagnant \\"Treefingers\\" which nearly made it to the fourth minute) id est you won't get sick of it, you'll want more of it.<br />\\"Like Spinning Plates\\"- The intro actually sounds like something is digging its way out of your stereo- Miraculous! After that you'll be treated with signature Radiohead electronica (Much like \\"Kinetic\\"- Sorry but I really love that song) & nightmarish lyrics. Should we ask for more?<br />\\"Life In A Glasshouse\\"- Yes we should. The last track here is, again, a fair candidate forbest song on the album. The trumpet + jazz section sounds authentic & much more important moving, particularly on the chorus. In point of fact Thom's vocals & lyrics (& the lyrics on this one are the best on the album- Perchance seeing that the song was written during the OKC period) sound a tad pallid when compared to Humphrey's trumpet. A must.<br />Stanley Donwood's artwork must be referred to aswell- This is pretty much his best work since OKC, so as someone else here already said make sure you're actually purchasing the album, not downloading it. ....
B00003CXRM|5.0|I want to add the other famous movie sequence which occurs at the KKK rally.  The Wizard of Oz.  Notice that the three overtake three guards (aka monkeymen) and are on a quest to save a decent person (blues singer - Dorothy).  The fire is a predominant factor in hurting the singer (Witch's broom on fire).  My first thought was that this scene was lifted from the Wizard of Oz rather than the Busby Berkeley aspects, the later of which are apparent in the choreography of the march scene.  Otherwise, there are many layers of tributes to old films which added to my enjoyment - my family's film of 2000.
B00005JGAB|5.0|In retrospect, it's easy to overlook how revolutionary and different this album was when it hit the streets in the second half of the '70s. Just play a Yes album, a Styx album, or an Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer album beside it to try to get an understanding.<br />Recorded for barely over $6,000, The Ramones' debut album broke all the rules of pompous '70s rock and a new type of music was &quot;invented&quot; in the process: punk rock. Not very different from '50s and '60s rock, just a lot louder and faster. No solos, just a bunch of power chords and catchy melodies. <br />Not counting the bonus songs, there are 14 songs on this album. None of them are longer than 2:32, and many of them come in at under two minutes. It's all over in less than half an hour. But there's more packed into those 30 minutes than many bands pack into an entire career. <br />The sound quality is very raw. However, the remastering has made the lows a bit lower and everything a bit crisper, making everything seem even more powerful than before. Dee Dee's bass is shoved into the left speaker, Johnny's guitar screams from the right, and Tommy's drums thud relentlessly in the background. On top of this, Joey spits out his lyrics with his unique accent and equally unique delivery.<br />And even though this album would have been a landmark just for the aforementioned qualities, the songwriting is strong as well. Everyone knows &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop (Hey Ho Let's Go),&quot; but every one of these tracks is fantastic. &quot;Judy is a Punk&quot; is my personal favorite, with three verses, three choruses and an instrumental break all packed into 90 seconds. <br />After this album was released, a whole new batch of bands started up. Suddenly, it didn't matter if you couldn't play like Keith Emerson or Steve Howe, all that mattered was how much you believed in yourself and your music. The Ramones were probably the first somewhat popular band to use its limitations in a positive way, and many other soon followed: The Clash, The Sex Pistols, Blondie, Talking Heads, U2, etc. Had it not been for The Ramones, these bands might not have formed, let alone have been signed to a major record label.<br />Quite simply, one of the most important - and fun - albums ever made.
B00000JFC5|5.0|This CD is my Fav. There are songs to mellow down to(Porcelain), songs to party with (Bodyrock), and songs that are just fun (Southside). Anybody would like this cd. I've played this cd for some of my friends and they all loved it.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Dan the Automator never ceases to amaze me. Here, he's joined forces with Damon Albarn, Del tha Funky Homosapien, Miho Hatori, Kid Koala, and a bunch of other big names among the underground and produced one of the wackiest and most musically interesting pieces of art I've had the pleasure of hearing recently. Hip-hop, experimetal rock, cuban, punk, electronica, and the art of scratching are all fused together seamlessly, and this album has found itself a spot in my car-CD wallet. If you were a fan of Automator's production on Dr. Octagon, on his own album (A Much Better Tomorrow), or Handsome Boy Modeling School; if you're a Blur fan; or if you just like music in general, do yourself a favor and pick this up. You won't regret it.
0441172717|5.0|What can be said about this novel that hasn't already been said. There are not enough superlatives in the English language. I have been reading this novel once or twice a year for 30 years. I have been reading the sequels in order as they came out for as long as they have been out.  I read Children of Dune in serial form when it was printed in Analog magazine beginning in January 1976 and eagerly awaited the issues for Feb., Mar., and Apr. of that year.  The entire series is well worth reading over and over again because, unfortunately, there will not be a seventh novel by Mr. Herbert.  When you finish, you want more and what better praise can one give.  The writing is excellent, the characters well formed, the plot  consistent and whole.  I love this series and this book in particular.  I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading.  I dont mean reading science fiction or fantasy...I MEAN READING!!!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This is a great Greatest Hits compilation.  The best known Hendrix songs are here such as &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;All Along the Watchtowe&quot;, and the brilliant &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;.  This is a nice introduction into the world of the single greatest guitarist in history, but does not fully showcase his genius.  The songs are overly produced taking away from the raw power his guitar exudes.  To get a better feel of Hendrix get one of his 4 studio albums, or some live stuff such as &quot;Hendrix: Live At Woodstock&quot;. Not the definitive hendrix collection, but for what its worth, certainly worth purchasin
006092988X|5.0|Amazing book. <br />The characters are vivid and full of life, the story is one-of-a-kind, and Betty Smith writes with beautiful language incorporating theme, style, and song lyrics to top it all off. As a 16-year-old reader, I fully appreciated what I learned from this book.. I learned to appreciate life and to embrace it with all I have. Perhaps you will learn something different, something more meaningful to you. I strongly suggest &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,&quot; as I regret I hadn't read it sooner.

B0000024TT|5.0|Orginally released in 1968, The Songs of Leonard Cohen was an album like nothing else comming out at that time. Then again, Leonard Cohen is artist like no one else before him. This was a time when political cynicism was echoed in the lyrics of Country Joe's Super Bird, (an ode to LBJ) and Dylan's Rainy Day Woman tested the airwaves with the refrain &quot;everybody must get stoned&quot;. <br />So what was it about the ultra-cool Canadian with the stoic attitude and monotone voice that was so captivating? To begin with the songs were plaintive, desperate, at times almost suicidal. The deeply religious overtones added to the mystery of the entire experience. In short this collection of poems was so profound, I can remember listening to it almost exclusively for three or four months. Even today, when I play The Songs of Leonard Cohen, I become so engrossed, so enraptured, that I drop everything and have to listen to it in its entirety, without interruption. I honestly can't say that about any other album.
6305128952|3.0|The film is great!!! However I just bought a 16 X 9 widescreen t.v. and this film in its letterbox format has black mattes at top and bottom which each take up 1/4 of the vertical screen. The image is presented as it was in the theatre, but even on my 55inch t.v. is only about 15 inches in height. If you have a big-screen 16 X 9 aspect t.v. then stay away from letterboxed dvds. Anamorphic widescreen is what you're looking for....
0385335482|5.0|Rebecca Bloomwood spent beyond her means and let it spin out of control because she failed to respond to her creditors and never asked herself if she really needed these things.  The purpose of a budget is to control spending, not deprive yourself of pampering.  That is what she made it out to be.  Eventually, the character triumphed with a job that she really loved and was able to keep in contact with her creditors.  This should be a valuable lesson for women who spend money they don't have and expect to be rescued from their situation.  This book was a great read and amusing.  But as consumers, we do have to be wise.
B000050XEI|2.0|I've really liked Enya over the years and have all her CD's, so I was looking forward to this one.<br />Unfortunately, there's really nothing new here. All the songs sound the same -- they sound like Enya, but they're all the same. You can't tell from this album if you're listening to &quot;A Day W/O Rain&quot; or someother previous album. Actually, since the songs are all the same, it's easy to tell the album.<br />So if you're starting out, do yourself a favor and start with an earlier (and much more interesting) album.

B00005ATQG|5.0|Perhaps the first \\"real\\" Stanley Kubrick film, \\"Lolita\\" shines as a masterpiece. The subject matter is difficult and unpleasant: a middle-aged Humbert Humbert (James Mason) becomes..obsessed with the provocative nymphet Lolita Haze (Sue Lyon). Even Sir Laurence Olivier turned down the role of pedophile Humbert, but eventually James Mason took on the role. It is a difficult one, but James Mason gives the performance of his career in this film.<br />Humbert Humbert comes to America to \\"find a haven\\" for himself. He is dapper, well-mannered, and polite. He finds lodgings living with the widowed Charlotte Haze, a pathetic.. woman brilliantly played by Shelley Winters. The reason the Humbert decides to stay is because of Charlotte's beautiful fourteen year old daughter Lolita. Humbert becomes obsessed with her, and damns himself when he marries the awful Charlotte to be near her. In a brilliantly played scene, Charlotte discovers Humbert's ..obsession with her daughter and kills herself.<br />Now Humbert is free to indulge in his passion for the nymphet Lolita. Sue Lyon as Lolita Haze gives a performance that was worthy of an Academy Award. New to acting, Lyon's Lolita is so raw, so real, so utterly convincing that we are compelled to see more. Humbert and Lolita go on a road odyssey together, occaisionally settling down, but moving when people become too suspicious of their relationship. In one scene, Lolita cries out against Humbert, cries out of the unfairness of her life and what he has done to her. Soon afterwards Lolita disappears.<br />Years later Humbert finds her again. She is married to a man her own age and is pregnant with his child. Lolita has the brains to realize that she had to get out of a situation that would destroy her. Humbert stands before her exposed, and we realize that he knows how sick his obsessions are. He breaks down before the \\"normal\\" Lolita, and leaves.<br />That brings us to the fourth great performance of \\"Lolita,\\" Peter Sellers as the quirky writer Clare Qwilty. Sellers is amusing and gripping in the role of a man who is Humbert's shadow in more ways than one. Because of the censors, Stanley Kubrick had to make the ..elements of the story merely suggestive. This heightens the feelings of the film. Such as when Lolita says that Humbert doesn't love her anymore because he \\"hasn't kissed her yet,\\" the camera fades to black. We are left to imagine what happens next. These combine to make \\"Lolita\\" a fascinating psychological character study in the lives of three desperate human beings and the girl who unknowingly destroys them all.quirky writer Clare Qwilty.

B000056N8X|3.0|This can only be an attempt to unseat Connor as the best  immortal.  Can Duncan fill his shoes? This can only be seen down the road.  The biggest mystery that should leave anyone viewing this Highlander episode is; do we see a new type of immortal emerging?  Faith/Kate, Duncan's long lost wife, loses her head to Jacob Kell.  She emerges later intact?  Has someone lost their train of thought on this?  Would Widen approve of this?  Other than this point the movie is pretty good in the Highlander sense.
B00005ALRO|4.0|If you're a fan of the suspense-thriller genre, this is one movie that you'll add to your home collection!  From its early foundation in the wrongful conviction of Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford)for the murder of his wife (Sela Ward), through  technically amazing crash/wreck/chase/shootout scenes, this film boasts a balanced combo of a complex plot, a tightly written script with real characters you can love and hate, and more twists and turns than a Coney Island roller coaster. It will easily satisfy the film fan who loves vivid, electric chase scenes and fast-paced action as well as the viewer who revels in a sophisticated plot that demands some intellectual involvement along with the visuals.  Not only is the film right on target in terms of the often strained relations between federal and local law enforcement; it also brings into clear view the political intrigues of modern medical research. Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding as the resourceful and dogged Marshal Sam Gerard.  If you've put off viewing this movie because you think you'd seen it all in the early television drama series ... think again.  I'll bet this is one movie you'll want to buy so you can watch it again and again - if for no other reason than to enjoy the visual craftsmanship of a good story well told.

B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is a truely wonderful film.  I remember seeing it after it won Best Picture, and even at age nine it touched me, inspired me, and made me laugh.  After seeing it, I decided it was one of the best movies ever created.  Now, after seven years, it still holds strong on my list of favorite movies.

6305364648|5.0|Many men like me enjoy action or adventure movies. And many women enjoy instead romantic movies or comedies. Here we have a film that combines both. I watched it with my wife and we both enjoyed it (usually, given our different tastes, only one of us really enjoys a movie...) This is due to the fact that there is first quite some comedy in the movie, as Schwarzenegger's wife, who seems to be a serious and boring person, gets embarked on an affair with a guy who pretends to be a spie...  I enjoyed the scenario with its many funny plays (e. g. the way  Schwarzenegger, a real spie, handles the affair), and the many surprises (which I do not want to reveal...). And there were good jokes (e. g. when the terrorist hangs on a rocket, and Schwarzie says \\"You're fired!...\\"- and fires the rocket), plus of course a lot of good action that builds up in the second half of the movie (without blood in spite of the dead Schwarzenegger scores.) Probably the fact that the movie has a great director (Cameron) makes the film such a success.<br />Another good thing is that the bad guys - some Arab terrorists  - are not too badly stereotyped, and they even get a chance to express their viewpoint and show  some qualities (willingness to sacrifice oneself). I am saying this because I hated a movie - Delta Force - with Chuck Norris where Arabs and Palestinians are awfully depicted, with extreme disrespect and stupid prejudices à la Hollywood. (BTW I am in no way Arab or Moslem, I only dislike the one-sided view the mass media gives of them)<br />I would recommend this movie as a good fun movie for both you and your spouse / partner. (But as I understand from some other reviewers, feminists may not like the movie for the way Schwarzenegger handles his wife in certain sequences - they don't understand it is meant as fun - Schwarzenegger does that kind of things in all his movies, he does not mean things seriously like Stallone does seem to. Anyway my wife who is no feminist enjoyed greatly these \\"controversial\\" sequences. ) But this sort of fun movie is not the kind I like to see and see again, I mean those movies that make you dream (like Milius' Conan the Barbarian, with Schwarzenegger) or that are very deep (like Boorman's Excalibur).
B000002MY3|5.0|How can I begin to say how incredibly amazing this woman is? She is real. She doesn't sing songs about &quot;O my god, my boyfriend dumped me!&quot; Or &quot;I caught my guy cheating, but I don't need him!&quot; No. She sings songs that are real (at least for people like me). Like PERFECT, a song about how your parents love you- if you are perfect. Or, how about IRONIC, which tells about how everything happens when you just don't want it to. Who could possibbly relate to that? Me. And other viewers. Everyone. And that's why she's amazing. She writes what she feels, and people listen. They don't just hear it, saying &quot;Catchy beat, cute lyrics. I like it.&quot; No, they HEAR it, saying &quot;Whoa. How did she know? I can relate.&quot; She is awesome. Totally. As is the album. If you miss this, fine with me. All I'll say is that you'll be missing out on your feelings, in a beautiful voice.
0441172717|5.0|...Dune brings the imagination of Frank Herbert to ink and he did a great job at it. The vivid writing that shows mood and action explains the story of Paul Atriedes, eight thousand years from now when civilization is again at a weak political tripod.<br />Imaginitive writing and the deeply involving plots and story keep you reading the entire 500 pages, not saying \\"Time to go to sleep\\", but rather \\"Time to find out what's gonna happen\\"<br />Frank Herbert's vast and dark story goes over a large collection of books, each one more than your money's worth. Be lucky you're paying so little....

B00003CXP1|5.0|A dark movie, not one to watch with those faint of heart. A beautifully disturbing account of the minds and worlds of drug addicts. A television/diet pill junkie and three dope fiends. The acting of both Marlon Wayans and Jared Leto are amazing. These boys donot get enough credit. That ending. Wow. It is the most un-sexually stimulating sex scene in a movie ever. This is a film that will stick to you and sneak into your mind when you least expect it.
B00004XONN|5.0|&quot;Kid A&quot; is brilliant and for those people who don't think it is I really don't understand why they think that way.  Let me just say that I am not one of those fans that likes this album just because it is by Radiohead.  I like this album because the music is beautiful.  This album is much different than OK Computer (obviously, or there would not be over a thousand reviews about it).  It is different mainly in the way the music sounds.  The music sounds more simple in their structuring.  But it is multi-layered music.  That's what is cool about it, you can hear things that you haven't heard before with each listen.  I don't think I have ever heard an album that fits together so nicely as this one.  All the tracks come together to form a complete and brilliant album.  If one track was left out it wouldn't be the same and it would suffer greatly.  I guess you are wondering why I am saying this album is so &quot;brilliant.&quot;  Well, have you heard the DESPERATION in Thom Yorke's voice when he sings &quot;This is not really happening!&quot; in &quot;idioteque.&quot;  If you did not notice the emotion he gives in singing that song then your pretty close to def.  In summary, I love this album, I feel that I am a better and smarter person for having listened to it and I am thankful to Radiohead for being the best and most creative band of the last decade.  This album really gets better with repeated listenings.  So, if you don't like it, just give it time, maybe it will grow on you.  Then again, maybe it won't.  That's all right though, everyone has different musical tastes.  For those who haven't heard the album, just buy it.
B00003CXDG|1.0|If you want a great DVD, this one will not disapoint you. It has a lot of extras, cool 5.1 sound. But as a personal advice, buy another DVD. You know, at this time when you can get Gladiator or X-Files Seasons or matrix or... is not enough to be a great DVD. A DVD must have good movie inside.<br />I'm really sorry that a great director like jhon Woo gets involved in this movie... I have been thinking about this a long time, how a movie with so many explosions, great action, great background (TV Series) could be so BAD. The answer comes with Mummy Returns. In that movie there is no Super-Sayayin (Tom Cruise) who do everything, there is a team, even the brother is important...<br />Now back to MI - 2. Only one man do everything, thats not what MI2 is about.. I hope this change in the future, but for now go away from this movie
B00005LMBK|4.0|If you are looking for a pop CD that will get heavy airtime and rotation on the radio...this isn't it.  And that is a shame because this is one of the most innovative albumns I have ever had the pleasure of listenening to.  I had been awaiting its release since I first heard bits of the song &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; on MTV2.  I just picked it up over my lunch hour and was blown away.  So, if you like funky hip-hop, slash, rap, slash rock...do yourself a favor and get this album, and let all your friends have a listen to...the sound is addictive.
B0000028MA|5.0|I was listening to this soundtrack the other day and it reminded of how bad today's music really is. The music of the early nineties is far superior and more meaningful than anything Britney Spears or Backstreet Boys will ever come up with.  I'm sorry but it is.  That's why in the long run the artists that made alternative music what it is will be remembered and Britney won't.  I long for the days when stuff like this was playing on the radio.  Anyway, I love this album because it is an eclectic mix of diverse songs that just plain rock.  It was cool that Crowe put in such old songs as &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot; and that song by Jimi Hendrix (I forgot the name of it).  Plus there is an excellent song by Mother Love Bone (after this band split up the remaining members formed Pearl Jam) called &quot;Chloe Dancer.&quot;  This song is up there with &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; as a combination of two different songs that come together to form an excellent extended musical composition.  Another great song is &quot;Drown&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins.  This is a long song that goes on when you think it should end.  But, once you get used to the weird ending you realize the beauty of that ending.  My favorite on this album would have to be &quot;Seasons&quot; by Chris Cornell.  This is a reflective piece that has Chris looking back to his past to see where has been to see where he is going to go.  I was listening to this song in the car the other day and it had been such a long time since I had heard the song that all the memories I had of myself listening to this song for the first time came rushing back as if a water gate had been opened.  It was cool because the song talks about the past and how everything goes by so fast.  Well, when I heard the song I was transported back to 1992 when I listened to this soundtrack all the time.  I have fond memories of that time period.  What a great feeling it was!
0767824571|5.0|&quot;The Holy Grail&quot; is easily the best of the three true movies released by the Pythons Monty.  Riding on the tail end of the Flying Circus, this of all the movies follows the same pattern as the hilarious sketch comedy series.  Unlike the semi-epic &quot;Life of Brian&quot; or the unquestionably abstract &quot;Meaning of Life,&quot; &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; uses the Flying Circus pattern of loosely connected sketches, only this time with a more apparent theme (the Arthurian legend, obviously).<br />Consequentially, most of the humor comes in disconnected packets on the order of about ten minutes each.  The beauty of this is that the movie can focus almost entirely on comedy, letting the insubstantial plot (certainly not the most prominent part of the film) sort itself out along the way.  From this unbridled font of humor comes all kinds of side-splitting antics on the part of the Python crew, from the hilariously satirical (How to tell a witch), to the hilariously irreverent (the Holy Hand Grenade), to the hilariously pointless (the Knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot;), to the hilariously hilarious (French taunts and livestock, undoubtably one of the most hilarious works of comedy ever recorded on film).<br />This is some of Pyton's best stuff; you'll have a heck of a time finding anything better by this group (but a good time nonetheless).  If you're looking for some of the same sketchy humor, don't bother with the other two movies.  Go for Python's non-movie theatrical feature, &quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl,&quot; the Flying Circus series, or the innumerable Monty Python CDs.  Short of a few Flying Circus gems, though, it doesn't get any better than this.
0060987464|5.0|Briam Warner AKA Marilyn Manson, who ever thought that he would be so compelled to write a book about his life and it actually make sense.     I love this book, It is my Favorite book in the Free world. Marilyn has a gift for words, not only in his lyrics, but also in his book. It was well written, emotional, very touching. It made me see a new light on the God situation.    If anyone has a bad opinion about Manson they should read this book, and follow his rules, laugh at his stories, and cringe when he tells you about his Grandfather.   I bought this book with upmost joy, and I advise this book to anyone Christian or not. Read &quot;Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot; you wont regret it.
0743200799|5.0|Mr. Kranz is a true American hero - and he represents the kind of hard work and dedication that took America to the moon in only 8 short years.  Perhaps if today's generation was as focused as Gene Kranz was during the Cold War, we would have fewer inexcusable mistakes - like the kind that destroyed Mars Climate Orbiter, Mars Polar Lander, and the X-33. Mission controllers are an underappreciated group at NASA; Kranz represents the best they have to offer.

0679746048|5.0|If you are a teenage girl, who is struggling with your emotions, than this book is for you.  It is a story of an 18 year old girl named susanna who is suddenly shipped off to a mental ward in a taxi, and she is diagnosed with a &quot;borderline personality&quot;.  She Doesn't even know what that is, but she deals with it.  The people are a little rough at first, but she finds out that the other women in the hospital  are actually more connected and even more sane than some of the ordinary people in the outside world.  She makes a connection with one of the girls, who sticks out as a fear-nothing-rebel.  They go on an emotional rollercoaster with eachother, and susanna lets all of her screams and cries out into her little journal.  The journal is her ticket out of the institution, and she eventually uses it.  She grows up to be a writer, like she always dreamed, and writes the story i am talking about right now.  <br />I personally thought this was an excellent book.  I don't read much.  When I saw advertisements for the movie on TV, it seemed interesting.  So, since I didnt want to bug my parents to pay money to go see it with me, I checked the book out at the library.  Since I am only 14, some of the things confused me.  But, I understood the storyline, and deeply connected, end felt as if I could relate with susanna kaysen.  After reading the book, I waited until the movie came out on TV, and I watched it.  It was very powerful, and I wanted to see it again and again.  I read the book often, and I understand things more as I read them.  Well, Please read the book, or rent the movie.  You will be deeply moved.
B00001QGPS|4.0|Method Man and Redman did great on this album.  The first few plays i was like yeah this is ok, few  good songs.  But after awhile i was like yeah yeah bump to this bump to this.  Meth/Red have so sweet lyrics.  They are some of the best that i have heard since Big L.  The favorite songs on the cd are the following.  2-Blackout (it starts the cd off right by slammin lyrics and great beats), 4-Y.O.U. (the start of this song is one of if not the best song on the whole cd), 5-4 Seasons (This song starts with Meth and Red and then go to two more great rappers named LL Cool J and then it goes to Ja Rule), 6-Cereal Killer (i think this is the best song of the cd, the lyrics are the best on the cd, the beats are great, and the over all song is the best), 7-Da Rockwilder (of course this is a great song, it was the first song out to the public and when i saw this on BET i just had to go out and buy this cd).  I think that the rest of the cd is ok but not the best.  The whole cd is about a 3.5 to a 4.  But this is a must buy no doubt about it.
B00004U8H4|4.0|You might think you know what to expect of \\"American Psycho\\" just by looking at the cover or reading a brief summary of it's plot. However, like it's title character, Patrick Bateman, what you see on the outside is nothing like what is going on inside. Don't make the mistake of thinking this movie is just a cheap slasher flick (check out the sequel for that) or even a horror movie at all. Sure, it's horrifying at moments, and damn suspenseful in others, but what \\"American Psycho\\" boils down to is a satire of a superficial society, based primarily on which apartment you rent, what clothes you wear, who you're sleeping with, and what your business card looks like. A world that could only exist in New York City, in the 80's. Do the words \\"Die Yuppie Scum\\" mean anything to you?<br /><br />Christian Bale plays Bateman to perfection. I can't say I ever read the book, but Bale brings the character to life almost effortlessly. In fact, it's impossible at this point for me to see him in any movie without recalling his role here. He just never lets up. Patrick Bateman is cynical, malicious and downright hilarious, all in one. The supporting cast is rather impressive as well, with Willem Dafoe playing a detective suspicious of Bateman, Reese Witherspoon playing his plastic fiance and Jared Leto playing his unspoken rival. Made in 2000, but set in the 80's, the movie looks and feels like it's time. Watching the movie, you can almost feel the cold streets of New York as Patrick gives his own assistance to a helpless vagrant. \\"American Psycho\\" is possibly as cold-hearted and as mean a movie as you can find, but it is saved by its blacker-than-black sense of humor. If you can laugh at a nude man in sneakers chasing a prostitute with a chainsaw down a flight of stairs, you might be in the right place.
B00005AKQE|5.0|This cd is just amazing... Creed really made some good music with these added tracks.. It's so good it's almost like a 3rd cd for them..

Creed's third cs will be released in stores Novemeber 20, 2001.. The band will go in the studio early July to begin recording
0375500901|4.0|With the Kill Artist, Silva has turned in another fine novel.  It was a true page turner - definitely difficult to put down.  The story provides action, excitement, intrigue and plot twists up to the very end.  Characters are developed throughout the book with effective inclusion of flashbacks.  The turmoil of the Middle East, the motivations of the parties involved, and the kill-or-be-killed emotional issues are brought forth effectively - helping to provide entertainment and intrigue at several levels.  There is no question........this is a book worth reading.
B00000IMCW|3.0|The amount of stars I have rated this DVD has nothing to do with how good this movie is (if that were the case, it would be five stars).     What you may already know, is the greatness of this movie itself, what you may not know is the different versions available. The only way to really enjoy this movie is in the directors cut. The US cut is a cramped, rushed version, that does not let you get the full flavor of the movie. Not to mention, both DVD's have no special features to make them appealing.     I am personally fortunate enough to have the old &quot;special edition&quot; laserdisc of this movie. It came in an oversized box with three digitally formatted discs. It also contained an unbelievable amount of memoribilia on the last disc, that contained the entire shooting script with the original &quot;suicide&quot; ending, countless pictures, television spots (foreign and domestic), radio spots, artwork, the real mall floorplans, board games, fan testimonials and more! This edition even has commentary by George Romero, his assistant director and his make up artist. This was an exrtemely advanced package for laserdiscs at that time.    You may think I am trying to brag, but I want you know what you're buying. I want the DVD version really bad, but am holding out for a better package to come along. There's nothing out there right now that is comparable to my laserdisc version, which is a shame. If you have to buy this movie, make sure it's the directors cut.
6305363668|5.0|The best of sci-fi noir, which is an underused but always good genre. Pure spectacle. Also try Dark City.
6304286961|4.0|This movie is driven by the psychedelic music of the Doors. In many of the concert scenes, the music is visually translated into colors and motion. The movie itself is more about Jim Morrison himself than the Doors however. When broadly displayed like this, Morrison's contempt for the order of society is obvious. Val Kilmer should've been given better parts after this movie because his performance is the best of his film career.
B00003CXSM|3.0|Ok, this is not a five star, poignant, touching, brilliant movie which will change your life -- so with a title like &quot;The Wedding Planner,&quot; what did you expect?  Imagine:  Maria (Jennifer Lopez) is a career-focused woman whose job is planning weddings, but her personal life is nonexistent; she's still not over having been jilted 6 years ago.  Finally, she meets a man who can relight her romantic fire, but guess what?  He's the fiance' of a very important client.  If you've ever seen a Hollywood romantic comedy, you can complete the plot from there, up to and including how it all turns out.  Still, if your expectations aren't too high, it will kill a couple of hours and give you an excuse to make popcorn.  <br />You do have to be able to accept Jennifer Lopez as a second generation &quot;Italian&quot; (*cough*), and the chemistry between her and McConaughey could have been stronger.  Still, it has its funny moments, and admirably avoids using the cheesy device of making the &quot;other partners&quot; unlikeable (so the main characters have an &quot;excuse&quot; to dump them).  It's not art, but it should go down smoothly with a glass of wine.
B00005LQ04|5.0|This is the most flamboyant horror movie ever. The movie's colorful cinematography completes the eerie story of a girl's horrible adventure at a haunted ballet academy in Germany. Most people don't understand the story because not a lot is mentioned until the sequel Inferno, but the haunted ballet is ruled by one of the Three Mothers, Mater Suspirioum. Mater Suspirioum was a witch who was also known as Helena Markos or The Black Queen. The faculty at the ballet academy is a coven for witches, and their leader is Mater Suspirioum. Mater controls most of the things that killed the people in the movie.  This movie is great, I suggest everybody sees it.
B00003CX5P|2.0|There are only three reasons to watch &quot;Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace&quot;: 1)The Pod Racing scene 2)The final lightsaber duel of the Jedis 3)Because this is a star wars movie.  THAT'S IT. There are just too many things wrong with this movie. For starters, why have they made &quot;The Force&quot; out to be something of a scientific nature? I liked the mystical and mysterious quality about &quot;The Force&quot; that was abundant in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Why was this movie aimed for children? All of the original Star Wars fans, like me, are in our twenties and thirties by now. I understood that Lucas was trying to get a new generation of Star Wars fans, but c'mon. This movie could be shown on The Disney Channel without editing a thing! Why, oh why didn't we see more of Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and Yoda? I wanted to see Mace whup somebody real bad with his lightsaber. I don't know about anyone else, but the true &quot;money shot&quot; would have been to see Yoda wielding a lightsaber and shoving it up a robot's &quot;you know what&quot;. Why were Jedis only slicing at robots throughout the whole movie anyways? The only other battle is the one with Darth Maul.  And what about the mysterious character known as Darth Maul? I realize that he's not a real talker, but they could have given a bit more background story on him. I admit, he was definitely interesting though. He was the best character in the movie and what did Lucas do? He kills him off. Why Lucas? WHY? He was an excellent menace to star in your next installment. Because of the heavy make-up, he could have been played by anyone with kung fu skills in Episode 2. Also, the movie dragged, BIGTIME thanks to its never-ending babble about politics in this Star Wars world. Lucas, I understand that you had to establish your plot, but about 30 minutes of the movie could have been cut if you hadn't gone ON AND ON about the &quot;Trade Federation&quot; and &quot;Naboo&quot; and all this other crap. All of that stuff could have been canned and it would have made room for the ideas listed above! These are only SOME of the things that were wrong with this movie. I could've gone on, but you get the point. Watch this once just to see the three things listed at the beginning. E-mail me if you have any comments for me. The original Trilogy still rules! Bye PEEPS!
B000002HEP|4.0|...this CD is all about really thick, sludgy guitar riffs ala Black Sabbath or the Melvins.  Some of the lyrics are a little sketchy but that's not what you're listening for...they're almost unimportant.  The one thing that substantially detracts from the whole experience is bad production; imagine listening with a pillow over your head.  More could have been had sound-wise but still a great guitar record.  Still a lame review...but maybe a little more helpful?

B00005B6C9|5.0|I'm a new fan but i know good music when i hear it. This album is awesome, it has so many different styles of music that you can't put it under one genre.  I like the way it shows Barry, Robin, and Maurice's different writing styles in their songs they did by themselves.  I have played it over and over again and when i listen to This Is Where I Came In several people have decided it was good and went out and bought the cd. I have to say the guys still have it.
B000003BF4|4.0|This is one of the best live CDs I've ever heard.  In fact, it stands as an excellent CD in its own right, given that live CDs (especially the Rolling Stones' recent live offerings) usually [stink].  The song selection is stellar throughout and the versions usually work, while the intro to the concert -- \\"It's looks like everybody's ready.   Are you ready?\\" -- perfectly creates the immediate feel that a live offering so desperately needs.  The Stones dust off a couple of Chuck Berry tunes to excellent effect (especially \\"Carol,\\" but \\"Little Queenie\\" works as well).  \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" unfortunately loses much of its country feel in this rock concert setting, but this loss is more than made up by the brilliance of \\"Midnight Rambler,\\" which starts out as a driving rocker only to grind to an absolutely gorgeous halt as a rough and dirty blues tune.  In fact, from \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" through to \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" the Stones hit the listener with four memorable tracks in a row.  Nothing in this CD is the definitive version, although I'll take this version of \\"Midnight Rambler\\" every time, but it is an excellent capture of the Stones in concert.
078322947X|5.0|Clouzot's &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; is a fine piece of French existentialism - well worth seeing. But Friedkin's &quot;Sorcerer&quot; is a much greater film in every respect. The &quot;backstory&quot; segments, where we get to see how each of the men ends up in his desperate situation, are absolutely astonishing - the grittiest and most convincing examples of &quot;documentary&quot; realism in fictional film-making that I've ever seen. No joke: these scenes make Sidney Lumet seem like Baz Luhrman. The truck journey is simply punishing - probably the most intense cinematic suspense ever filmed. And the ending is unforgettable - a shattering experience.<br />I'm not sure why this film and Friedkin's other overlooked gem, &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;, have yet to receive the acclaim they deserve. (That Friedkin is, by his own admission, a prize jerk may have something to do with it.) But you owe it to yourself to see this movie. It's one of the great ones.
0316776963|3.0|After breezing through Sedaris' previous three books -- all of which had me laughing out loud -- I found this fourth entry in his collection to be a bit of a non-starter. The second half of his essays, in which he details his experience as an ex-pat living with his boyfriend in France, whizzes by with typically sardonic Sedaris wit. But the first half felt stunted, tired, and a bit...dare I say it? Unfunny. I guess I expected a bit more. The droll humor didn't quite do it for me.
0385335482|5.0|This is probably one of those few cases when the expression &quot;don't judge a book by its cover,&quot; really applies. If one considered the title of this book, he/she would most likely view it as materialistic and artifical- but it is anything but. Sophie Kinsella's novel about Rebecca Bloomwood, a miserable financial journalist is realistic and HILARIOUS!
0380973650|5.0|Shadow went to prison for beating up two men, but receives parole after three years of doing time. Because he is big and radiates a &quot;don't mess&quot; attitude, Shadow had no problems there. Two days before he is to be freed, the warden informs Shadow that his wife died and he can leave to make proper funeral arrangements. Shadow loved his wife and is rocked by the news.<br /><br />When Mr. Wednesday arrives on the scene just before the funeral of Shadow's wife, the grieving ex-con welcomes the craziness that ensues. Mr. Wednesday is actually Odin and with the other ancient gods and mythical creatures walks the earth though no one believes in them anymore. Mr. Wednesday and cohorts are growing weaker and he wants to make one last confrontation for the hearts of Americans.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman uses flashbacks to show how leprechauns, Odin, pixies other creatures of myth and legend other came to the New World. They traveled here in the hearts and souls of the immigrants. This pure epic urban fantasy demonstrates why Mr. Gaiman remains the grandmaster of the sub-genre. The Old Ones need people to believe in them again, but doubt they can achieve their noble objective. The climax is incredibly original so that no one will guess what will happen. AMERICAN GODS might prove to be the fantasy tale of 2001 as it is already that of the midpoint.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00004RJ74|2.0|The opening scene was very tense and suspenseful. The brutality of the theives kept me on edge because of their willingness to kill. After their escape to a motel, the film went downhill very fast. Without giving away anythng, when you get shot, you at least TRY to tend to it, not wrap it in duct tape! After arriving in Mexico, the movie turns abruptly into a horror-comedy, which I absolutely hate. Be one or the other please! The action in the Mexican bar was very predictable and been-there-seen-it before. Very disappointing overall.
B00005BJPO|5.0|Film is an interesting field of entertainment.  It's arguably the most varied and diversified of all forms of entertainment.  Not to short change other forms, it's just that films have more tools to play with to convey whatever it is they want.  In this wild industry of art Anime is probably the most diverse, no other genre exists that has stories about 16 girls with giant breasts saving the universe and stories like Akira, which is un-arguably the greatest modern work of Japanese culture and quite possibly the greatest modern work of story telling, period.  While the film is brilliant, the manga of which it's based on goes beyond perfection and transcends itself to the level of holy literature, anyone who has read all 6 parts (around 2000 pages) will know what I mean.  Basically it is the ultimate story, making the Bible look like a bed time story.  What I mean by ultimate is not that it has 'everything' I mean that it is perfect in conveying what we are, what we aren't and what we want, which is the basis of all story telling.  The film cuts out around 90% of the events in the manga but still manages to do it justice.  Forget everything in your life and experience the movie as well as the manga.

0792846303|5.0|IT IS DEFINETLY A CLASSIC SPOOKY MOVIE.  IT PULLS YOU IN FROM THE BEGINNING AND PULLS YOU IN DEEPER AND DEEPER UNTIL THE END.  IT IS A LOW BUDGET MOVIE, BUT TRULY SPOOKY.  JAMIE LEE CURTIS AND ADRIENNE BARBEAU ARE TERRIFIC IN THIS MOVIE.  ONE OF JOHN CARPENTER'S BEST.
B000002H33|5.0|This album changed my life... This is the first Metallica album I heard back in 87, I was 13. First I was scared, then I was curious, finally I was hooked, I didn't know that music could give me that feeling. It shows the incredible talent of James Hetfield, how can he play that fast while singing, it's amazing! It's also the last album featuring Cliff Burton, the most inspirationnal metal bass player of my generation (I still wonder what Metallica would be today with Cliff still alive... would he have cut his hair ???). So, I you don't know the pre-Black album era of Metallica, you're really missing something.
B000003KMM|4.0|THIS IS A SLAPSTICK COMEDY ABOUT BASEBALL, CHARLIE SHEEN AND TOM BERENGER ARE VERY, VERY FUNNY IN THIS.  IT'S ABOUT A PITCHER WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE AT THE END OF HIS CAREER.  IT IS A GROWN UP VERSION OF THE BAD NEW BEARS.  VERY FUNNY INDEED.
B000009QPE|5.0|That says it all, hold your breath and get in this thirty minutes rollercoaster that never slows down. This is the most violent album ever made, a classic in the genre.
6302453356|5.0|I THINK THEIR IS A LITTLE PETER PAN IN EVERYONE, AND EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE TO GET YOU BACK TO YOUR CHILDHOOD, WHERE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS THINK GOOD THOUGHTS AND YOUR FLYING.  THIS MOVIE IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE.  WITH ROBIN WILLIAMS AS PETER PAN AND DUSTIN HOFFMAN AS CAPTAIN HOOK AND JULIA ROBERTS AS TINKERBELL, IT COULD BE NOTHING MORE THAN A GREAT MOVIE, IT HAS SPECIAL EFFECTS, A GREAT STORY AND GREAT TALENT.  STEVEN SPIELBERG MAKES YOU WISH THAT YOU CAN TURN BACK AND RELIVE SOME OF YOUR HAPPIEST AND MAYBE EVEN YOUR SCARIEST CHILDHOOD FANTASIES. AND WITH THIS MOVIE YOU CAN TRULY FLY!!!
B0000025RI|5.0|I was 5 years when &quot;Thriller&quot; came out and I loved it.There was nobody I knew back then that didn't have this album. I am now 24 and I still love this album. This album is a classic and deserves a place among other great classics by artists which include: Marvin Gaye,the Beatles,The Eagles, and Bob Marley just to mention a few.This is a gem.Perhaps the younger artists of today need to take another listen of &quot;Thriller&quot; and learn the meaning of making &quot;real&quot; music.
B00004TJFL|5.0|I HAVE ALL THE HALLOWEEN VIDEOS, AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE SERIES.  I LOVED THEM ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HALLOWEEN 3 THE SEASON OF THE WITCH.  THE LITTLE GIRL JAMIE PLAYED BY DANIELLE HARRIS IS MICHAEL'S NIECE AND SHE IS COMMITED TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL AND TREATED BY NONE OTHER DR. LOOMIS WHO IS ONCE AGAIN PLAYED BY DONALD PLEASENCE.  MICHAEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD BUT OF COURSE DR. LOOMIS KNOWS BETTER AND SOMEHOW JAIME KNOWS EVERYTHING AND EVERYWHERE UNCLE MICHAEL IS AND DOING.  <br />IT IS A GREAT MOVIE IF YOU ARE A DIE HARD FAN OF THE HALLOWEEN SERIES, LIKE MYSELF.  THE ONLY THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS THE STRANGER WHO IS WEARING BLACK AND THE SPURS, I DON'T THINK THEY EVER EXPLAIN WHO HE IS AND WHAT HIS CONNECTION TO MICHAEL IS.  BUT OTHERWISE GET THIS MOVIE.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I frist purchased the godfather series 1&amp;2 when they had Bata machines in the 80's.  I very much enjoyed the movies then and now.  I was pleased when the &quot;Godfather III&quot; came out.  In my oppion the DVD set should be the best set to own in ones collection.  A must to own!  If your an if'y fan I must say this is a great buy for 6 disc's. J-Indianapolis, Indiana
0790736039|5.0|EVERYONE IN THIS MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT.  IMAGE GROWING UP AND STILL BEING AFRAID OF YOUR CHILDHOOD &quot;GHOSTS&quot;.  THIS MOVIE TAKES EVERY CHILDS FEAR AND MAKES IT REAL, AND SOO SCARY THAT EVEN AS AN ADULT YOU HAVE THESE FEARS AND THEN TO ADD TO IT THROW IN A HOMICIDAL CLOWN.  A CLOWN TO A CHILD IS SUPPOSED TO BE A HAPPY, AND CHERISHED ICON.  IN THIS MOVIE IT IS PURE EVIL.  IT IS A CLASSIC THRILLER. IT HAS EXCEPETIONAL TALENT WITH JOHN RITTER, RICHARD THOMAS, ANNETTE O'TOOLE, TIM REID AND OF COURSE TIM CURRY WHO WAS FABOULOUS AS FRANK N FURTER IN ROCKY HORROR HE IS PRICELESS AS THE CLOWN.  LOVED IT.  KIDS DID TOO.
0380973650|5.0|The short review: Oh. My. God. Read this book.<br />The longer one: What Gaiman did for London in Neverwhere, he does for a whole country in American Gods. Does the US have room for the old gods? What new gods are formed in this age of media and technology?<br />Shadow is released from prison a day early due to his wife's sudden death. He is offered a job by an enigmatic old man and finds himself questioning what, exactly, he believes. He is visited by his dead wife and meets a pantheon of deities from many cultures and many times. A storm is coming, a battle between the old gods and the new, and Shadow is wanted by both sides...<br />Gaiman's vast knowlege of old stories and older gods combined with his gift for creating rich characters adds up to a beautifully crafted tale of America.
0671867369|5.0|This is the best book I have read on small unit actions in World War II.  Ambrose has set the standard for others to follow.  The soldiers in this book are real, I had the pleasure of meeting the 1SG while stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.  With 18 years of service in the Army with experience in Armor, Infantry, Artillery and a History Degree this book is flawless.  I had the honor of commanding a company in the 82nd Airborne Division and made this book a manditory read for my Lieutenants professional development.  The brilliance of Ambrose as an author is his blending of accurate history and technical authenticity without sacrificing the bond between soldiers; the human side often missing in history books.  If you love this book you must read Pegasus Bridge and Citizen Soldiers by the same author.  Can't wait until his next book!
B00005ALRO|4.0|even though this is a chase movie; it's appeal lies mainly in the two leads. they are both so strongly drawn,that you will be cheering for both of them.much of the action takes place in and around chicago;and the city has a certain undeniable charisma as it is filmed here. it's a great ride for any reason.
B00004X01U|4.0|I've been a Madonna fan for quite a while, of course her greatest work was the Immaculate Collection, but this wasn't as bad as some people were making it out to be.  Here are some songs that I thought were great from this album:1. Music-Yes, this is why I bought this album in the first place.  Didn't really like the song at first, but it grew on me!2. Runaway Lover-Gotta love the catchy beat on this one!3. Nobody's Perfect-I don't know why people are not a fan of the so-called 'vocoder', but I think it makes the song stand out from the rest with it and a lot of great songs were made by using this.4. Don't Tell Me-This is the song that I have played the most on here. I've heard this a ton of times and I'm always coming back for more.5. What It Feels Like For A Girl-Her newest song, great beat to this as well.Not a bad effort on her part at all here! I'm feeling this!
B00003CXR0|5.0|This is one of the very best movies that I have seen in years. Extremely rare use of profanity, the photography is like watching a beautiful classical picture pass before your eyes, and the music is wonderful. The actors were perfect for and very convincing in their parts. Johnny Depp even played some of the music in the score, and the scene with him and the worm was delightful. Juliet Binoche was both winsome and spirited as the new proprietress of the &quot;chocolaterie.&quot; She was a good role model for young women today. Judy Dench, always wonderful, was superlative in her role as the crochety old woman. I have seen the movie six (6)times and each time there was something different to see, something I had missed in a prior viewing. To my way of thinking it should have won an Oscar... or three!
B0000004V2|5.0|The opening track &quot;I want to be adored&quot; hooks me every time.  This is one of the rarest of musical finds, like the Beatles Revolver, and Still Feel Gone by Uncle Tupelo it will forever find regular rotation on my stereo.  There are few albums which can be listened to tirelessly, this is one.
6305095442|5.0|Want to see who can take it? Then rent this and gather as many prudes as you can and just watch the room clear out. If you get offended by this movie, possibly the funniest comedy/horror ever filmed then maybe you should also be under the &quot;Earthen floor of the fruit cellar!&quot;
B00005B4GU|5.0|If Kid A polarized people then Amnesiac should bring them back together.  As with each Radiohead album, Amnesiac ushers in a new feel.  But this time the feel, while lacking the bombast of OK Computer or the ethereal otherworldliness of Kid A, manages to sound somewhere midway between the two.
B00005B36H|4.0|Before I go on and start marketing this album as perhaps the best thing to hit store shelves in a long time, I should note my one major grievance with Tool:  the skill by which they intentionally alienate the listener.  Lateralus, in all it's beauty, comes across as almost lifeless.  Why?  Because Lateralus is intensely concept-driven, and much less emotional and passionate than their previous two efforts (Undertow and Aenima).  Tool seemed to change their focus, and their music suffered (only a little) for it.  That is not to say that Lateralus is any less than a beautiful piece of work!<br /> Let me still remind you that this album IS a masterpiece.  As a musician, myself, I deeply respect the talent these guys have.  Lateralus is more than worth the five years it's taken for it to hit the CD stores.  Then why did I rate it 4 out of 5 if it's a &quot;masterpiece&quot;?  Because I'm looking at this album as a whole.  While my three favorite songs (&quot;the grudge&quot;, &quot;parabol&quot;, and &quot;parabola&quot;) leave absolutely nothing to be desired, songs like their first single &quot;schism&quot; are lacking when it comes to Maynard's vocals.  I know what you're thinking: &quot;*GASP!*  How dare I insult God-almighty himself!&quot;  but the fact of the matter is, that while the rest of the gang has managed to improve upon their already amazing musical talents, Maynard perhaps got a bit too comfortable, writing several songs that I equate to &quot;singing an essay&quot;.  Come on, dude!  This is music; if the words are more important than rhythm and harmony, write a speech!<br /> I was pleased to find that the lengthy intros and what I call &quot;non-songs&quot; of Aenima weren't employed here.  This is, after all, supposed to be a MUSICAL album.<br /> Although it has nothing to do with the album itself, the sleeve and album design is amazing.  That, itself, deserves 5 stars.<br /> Some people might look at my review and say that I'm not a true Tool fan forcalling this long-awaited collection SOMEWHAT disappointing, and to them, I would say &quot;I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, but he's been in some God-awful movies&quot;.  I've been a fan of Tool since &quot;Prison Sex&quot; debut on 120 Minutes nearly a decade ago, and Maynard, Justin, Danny, and Adam will ALWAYS be four of my favorite musicians.
0312932081|5.0|Ender's Game is a book that emblazons itself upon your psyche.  The reader is immediately immersed in the adult-child war game realm of the characters and as pages turn you cannot help but to accept that human survival may depend on the creative thinking of a child.  Of course, as the reader follows Ender's maturation as warrior and person there is the subltle recognition that children become adults two ways, gradually and then suddenly.
B00003CXRM|2.0|Tagged as the team of the consummate quirky movie, the Coen brothers' newest release, Oh Brother Where Art Though, is one supposes their clever reconstruction of Homer's Odyssey with a heavy sprinkling of blue grass music.<br />In it three connected members of a chain gang go on a journey for treasure that George Clooney's character, Ulysses Everett McGill, says he has hidden. His partners played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson complete the ensemble of misfits.<br />There are some readily recognizable episodes from the Odyssey imaginatively set in the 1930's South. The most pleasing is John Goodman as the Cyclops. The music is placed throughout the movie and seems a natural counterpart to the performance. The movie is well acted and constructed.<br />However, as with all the Coen films, their humour is inevitably at the expense of a disadvantaged demographic. Their films habitually exploit the setting and people in rural, geographically depressed areas. What is funny about this? It is pity that they feel they have the right to mine this material in the first place, and it is a pity that their imaginations cannot extend beyond it.<br />There is a limited appeal to the Coen films which I'm sure they rationalize as being misunderstood by the wider audience. In plain fact the audience recognizes the films as meanly comical and wildly stereotypic and chooses not to go. Oh Brother, Where Art Thou is only another sugar-coated extension of this meanness.

B00003W8NM|1.0|I gave this piece of crap one star becasue the site wouln\dn't let me give it less. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is the movie for you if you're into the closet bound, homoerotic fantasies of a schizophrenic who is not capable of having sex with a woman unless he imagines that another guy is doing it. What really scares me is that the whimps that like this garbage are allowed to walk the streets wihtouth a keeper. If they're so into fighting why don't they put on gloves and get into a ring. Because they'd get the life beatren out of them, that's why. This kind of junk-- and Neil LaBute's &quot;In The Company of Men&quot; are supposed to be &quot;real guy&quot; movies. Real eunuch movies is more like it.
B000000WA4|5.0|What can I say about Mellon Collie other than the fact that it's the best album ever?  There are so many songs to listen to, and there is so much variety here (from softer ballads to heavy rockers) that I could listen to it for hours on end, it is definitely the best album by the Pumpkins simply because of all the great songs on it.  This was my first Pumpkins album, and I admit it took a while to get used to, but now all I listen to are Pumpkins albums, and this is the best one out there.  None of the songs are bad, the album is one smooth listen without having to skip any songs.  From the beautiful instrumental opener, to the powerful Tonight, Tonight, to the arena-rock Bullet With Butterfly Wings (which, by the way, sounds just as loud and powerful everytime you listen to it), to the masterpiece Porcelina of the Vast Oceans, all the songs are just perfect.  And that is just the first disc!!!  On the second, there is 1979 (one of the best Pumpkins songs ever), the mega-rocker X.Y.U., and all the other songs that help make this the best CD money can buy.  It deserves 10 stars, since it is so good.  Not only do I pity the Pumpkins fan who doesn't own this 2-disc epic, but I pity anyone who is a fan of good music and doesn't own this.  So what are you waiting for, go buy it!  After a few listens, I guarantee these will be the only 2 CDs you'll want to listen to for a long time.
B00000I7GH|5.0|A dominating attempt to break ground with psychedelic and progressive rock. Amon duul2 fuse so many influences even occasionaly reminding this reviewer of an arabic or indian feel.<br />Bouncy, playful and not lacking at all in talent or music writing skill Amon Duul2 supercede thier counterpart Amon Duul1 in the ability to pop immulate the feel from the hippie commune they both inhabited. Appointing the gesture of world saving unity wailings in Jibberish, German, and English, Amon duul were known to have desired peace with all.<br />Much credit due to this completely unique and original album. Unique entirely to its genre, it is truely hard to get better then this.
B00003CXN4|4.0|Traffic is about America's obsession of the drug war. The movie has three different stories. A Ohio supreme court justice (Douglas) is appointed the position of &quot;drug czar&quot; and oversees the operations of eliminating the Mexican cartels. Only to find out that his honor student daughter is a coke addict. Overtime his daughter falls into the world of addiction. In Mexico, a proud police officer (Del Toro) is confronted daily with the corruption of his fellow officers. Alone he tries to infilrate and bring down the cartels. And finally a wealthy socialite (Zeta Jones) in San Diego watches in horror as her husband arrested for selling drugs. For all the time she's been married to him she hasn't been aware of shady business. In these hard times she becomes desparate and will do anything to preserve her lifesytle. The director of the movie did an excellent job of blending in the stories. I was also impressed with the use of different color shades throught out the movie.<br />I've heard criticism about the movie being &quot;pro drug&quot; and it was typical of the Hollywood left. I disagree, the movie takes a different look at the war on drugs through the eyes of the various characters. Douglas's character comes to the conclusion that he can't win the war when he's losing the battle at home with his daughter. Traffic gives the message that America needs a different approach on winning the war on drugs.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Everything about this movie was amazing.  Even though in the beginning I got a little dizzy, it was fabulous.  It was romantic, fun, emotional, sad, loving, and enjoyable.  It had songs to remember, fun, upbeat, and the songs made me want to buy the soundtrack.  This was like a perfect movie all together.
0064400018|5.0|This has been one of my favorite books since I was a little girl.  I've read and i own ALL the Little House books that have come out so far.  All the origal books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, the books about Rose, Caroline, Charlotte and Martha.  I love those books but the orginal ones by Laura Ingalls Wilder are of course, the best.  This book is about five year old Laura Ingalls and her sister's, seven year old Mary, adventures in the Big Woods of Wisconsin.  This book is the first Little House book.
6303593666|4.0|I purchased the VHS version of this incredible film. I saw it twice in the past. One time was in college, as part of the curricula was to show students in advertising some of the basic principles that can be applied to the present. However, I must ask this question.  Am I mistaken or has this film been edited? I seem to remember a different beginning: Hitler was standing alone at the doorway to the plane,looking out with a dreamlike visionary expression on his face. In addition, I seem to remember footage of that awesome rally at night with the beacons on either side of the audience (was it Nurenberg?), a greater amount of people in traditional German costumes and a display of the &quot;classic&quot; Aryan faces and bodies marching to the music. If I am not mistaken, it is a shame that these scenes were excluded, as it took away from my expectations of a more impressive version of the film. Is it ever possible to purchase an uncut version?
0064400557|5.0|One of my favorites.  The first chapter book that I ever read.  This book is about a pig named Wilbur and his friend, Charlotte the Spider, who saves him from being butchered.  Because of Charlotte's help not only is Wilbur's life saved but he also becomes famous.  This is such a touching story!
B00005K2UF|5.0|They're singin' and they're swingin'! They're NEW YORK VOICES and they're back at last! Equally masterful at ultra-tight, harmonized, jazz vocal ensemble singing, as well as daring, individual vocal scat solo flights, vocalists Peter Eldridge, Lauren Kinhan, Darmon Meader (who also blows a mean tenor sax!), and Kim Nazarian have delivered their most swinging outing to date. Backed by a roaring big band, NEW YORK VOICES puts a fresh, new- and decidedly vocal- spin on Swing Era and post-World War II big band classics, with Sing! Sing! Sing!
0141301155|1.0|In third grade my teacher made us read this book and then made us watch the movie.  That was the suppidest, lamest, dumbest, worst book that I have ever read and the worst movie that I have ever seen.  Since, then I have been forced many times by teachers to watch that horrible movie.  I don't know what Ronald Dahl was thinking when he wrote that horrid book.  Or why anyone would want to make it into a movie.  I happen to like all of the other books that I have read by Ronald Dahl, especially Matilda and the Witches.(And their movies)  But, not that book.  In conclusion, I HATE CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY!  And I give it a ZERO, 0 for a rating.  ZIP, ZERO, Zilch!  Not even one star, like I had to put because zero wasn't a choice.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|All I can say is thank god for Australia, where Baz is from and where all of the movie was made, cus americans wouldn't have the talent or the balls to create something as brilliant as this!
B000002UHG|4.0|The main reason I got this one is because it was by one of the members of Pink Floyd and I need to keep my collection fairly complete.  Its not a bad album but it doesn't compare to any of the Floyd works.  If you liked Wet Dream, you should like this one.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I've been a fan of Travis for while now and just got the opportunity to see them live last week.  They are amazing...I've developed a bit of a crush on Fran, he sings with such emotion.  I went right out and bought this CD and it hasn't left my CD player since.  I've already listened to it six times today and I can't decide which song is my favorite.  Sing, Side, Pipe Dreams, Safe and Last Train are probably my favorites.  This CD is a little more upbeat than the last 2 albums and the words are sometimes a little cheesy, I think Fran is in love.
0140186395|5.0|Steinbeck proposed four potential titles before he settled upon East of Eden. I looked up the phrase in the Bible and found that it appears twice in Genesis (3:24 and 4:16); both accounts denoting an instance where man experienced a separation from the blessings that God had intended for him. I think this is very significant as we consider what Steinbeck was writing about in his allegorical novel. He says in Chapter 34, &quot;We have only one story. All novels, all poetry are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal.&quot;<br />The contest is in ourselves! Surely this is what East Of Eden teaches us while we enjoy the sweeping story, so well told. It is deadly realistic, as beautiful and revolting as is the actual human potentiality for good and evil. With brilliance, Steinbeck contrasts a sea of temperaments in these characters, and shows us all the while that life is much more than the choices we make, but it is never any less. Adam Trask is the representative of good intentions, of a conscience which responds to the good as the eye responds to the light. Samuel Hamilton also represents a similar (perhaps even more well-honed) goodness. But Adam is the one who has been deceived, by a force every bit as essentially evil as Eden's serpent in the tree. This is Cathy, a character so reprobate that evil isn't something she does, it's something she IS that INFECTS everything she does! After abandoning her twin boys Caleb and Aron to the care of their father (Adam) she returns to her life of debauchery. The boys grow up unaware that their mother is a serial murderer and owner of a whorehouse. Because Adam never fully recovers from his shame, his loss and disillusionment, he is not able to convey the appropriate unconditional (equally distributed) love to his sons. This leads to jealousy and rivalry in his boys, and is a generational replica of his own childhood.<br />How can one summarize such a vast epic story? But for me, one of the most powerful scenes and a turning point (perhaps the denouement?) is when Caleb finally sees his mother in all her non-glory, and says to her... &quot;I don't have to be you.&quot; The reader can notice that really no-one is the same from this point on, there is a real unravelling here. For Cathy (now &quot;Kate&quot;), this marks the beginning of her own self-destruction, the awakening of her own conscience. She's been defied!<br />One of the tendencies of the modern age is to deny radically the absolute nature of conscience, reducing it to a matter of temperament, or to a product of history or social environment. But East of Eden plows right through a tangle of sociological, psychological, and historical half-truths to the elementray fact: CONSCIENCE EXISTS.dhood.<br />How can one summarize such a vast epic story?

B00005LMBK|5.0|I first heard &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; a couple of months ago on the local college radio station.  I was instantly hooked and found myself bobbing my head as I cruised through Uptown.  Next I heard &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;Rock Tha House&quot;.  Both are phat tracks.  After hearing those three songs, I knew that Gorillaz was gonna be the album of the summer.  Thus, it was with much anticipation that I waited until the album was released.  I just picked it up today and after listening to it a couple of times, I have to say its already my favorite album of the year.  The mixture of cool beats and laid back melodies will put a smile on your face instantly.  If you liked Handsome Boy Modeling School or Deltron 3030, check this album out.

However, I have just purhased &quot;Roots&quot; a newly introduced CD written, produced - everything by Gregg Rolie of Santana fame. I HIGHLY recommend getting it..Gregg brings back that Santana flare with even a smoother edge. His voice has not aged a bit he is a real pro...
6305291489|5.0|This is a classic. Every time I watch it, it's as good as the first time I saw it in the theater. I love the camp setting. The girls come from such great backrounds,though they may be a bit unrealistic. Sometimes when you watch a movie it's so unrealistic it's almost annoying. In this movie I think the plot is so strong and fun,that the fact that this would probably never happen in real life is what makes the movie more creative and exciting. This movie also makes every girl want to be a twin,as it portrays all of the wonderful parts of being one. This is a great story for everyone.
0060920084|5.0|Since many of the reviews below do a fine job of describing this book's general attributes, I'll just mention a few things you'd best remember when reading a Bill Bryson book, particularly The Lost Continent:<br />First, Mr Bryson's doesn't write guidebooks or serious travelogues. He writes anti-guidebooks. Much of The Lost Continent is a counterpoint -- indeed a cure -- for the attacks of 'Meaningfulness And Insight' one sometimes suffers when reading even the best of the 'serious' travel writers such as Jonathan Raban. <br />Second, he's not making fun of the places he goes, the people he meets, and the things he sees because he's a big old meanie. He's trying to be funny, and he tells the unvarnished truth about what he sees and experiences, unlike many travel writers --both professional and amateur -- who simply cannot admit they've come a long way to see something, only to find it disappointing. Mr Bryson is criticized in many reviews for being a 'tourist' not a 'traveler', but it's only tourists who think every sight they see is fascinating simply because they've chosen to see it.<br />Third, Mr Bryson's not 'arrogant' because he doesn't praise everything about America and Americans. In fact, if American readers can hold back their splutters of outrage, they'd realize very quickly that he's *including himself* in nearly all the jokes he makes. A surpassingly ignorant reviewer below has asserted, for example, that our Bill's a hypocrite because he makes jokes about fat people, but then dines on a six-pack and candy bars. Well, of course he does -- Mr Bryson's acknowledging that, for all his griping about fast food and convenience stores and fat bellies, he's no better able to resist temptation than any other American. How many other travel writers -- or any writers at all -- allow us to see them being so fallible? This is arrogance?<br />Finally, I would recommend that the careful reader of The Lost Continent will find much more here than humorous description and anecdote, although both abound. There's also a story. Its only real character, of course, is Bill Bryson, but it's a character who is ultimately open to and changed by his experiences, both in making his comic journeys and in the remembrances of his boyhood his travels evoke. Mr Bryson is seeking more than just an elusive epitome of small-town America; he's trying to learn how to be an American again after a long time away, and he's finding it tough going at times. As an American (an Iowan, even) who's lived overseas for more than a decade myself, I find this story more and more compelling every time I come back to visit both 'lost continents' -- the real one, and this fine book. <br />Highly recommended.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Since the release of this film there have been none that have managed to take you to that fantasy realm in your mind. For any fan that thought the latest &quot;Star Wars&quot; installment would take you away, here is a movie that delivers. With the added special effects featurette this is a must have for your video collection. From the first shot panning across the fields with numberous herds of dinosaurs you are taken away. It seems to me this is the first movie since Spielberg's &quot;Jaws&quot; that also displays his talent for creating a tense, horrific feel. Yet at the same time this movie keeps its majestic apeal for those who always dreamed of what it would be like to live among dinosaurs.
0792101448|5.0|This movies has to be the best western ever made, sorry Clint. Henry Fonda was great has the villan, and Charles Bronson What can I say but DVD I am waiting for you.

031286504X|5.0|....I...loved the book because it didn't portray its main protagonist as a super hero but as a normal man, with normal man's emotions and feelings. I could easily identify myself with I Am Legend's Robert Neville, especially that I read the book in a period where I was enduring excessive amounts of emotional stress. I felt so close to Robert neville. Almost half a decade after it was 1st published, the novel's depiction of modern society and Man's every day struggle is still quite vivid and quite alive today more than ever. The only difference between the novel and the real life is that in real life, the vampires are disguised as normal people and they feed by sucking on your soul and not on your blood. This novel belongs to the horror genre indeed, but you will be gladly treated to a social/psychiatric study of the human nature, tinted with hints of theology, mysticism and occasional humor. I also loved the author's scientific approach in unmasking the unknown and demystifying the vampire myth. I Am Legend is truly an avant-garde and a riveting tale of a man overcoming adversity by fighting against his inner demons and coming face to face with himself. I Am Legend is above all a wonderful modern-day fable and an inspiring metaphor of courage and humanity.
B00005JGAF|5.0|ROCKET TO RUSSIA was released in mid-1977, at the height of the fury that was known as Punk Rock. Sire Records was gearing up for some serious sales and betting a lot on the Ramones. It's no wonder, then, that the album has the band's cleanest, leanest, most accessible sound, refined to defiant, power-chorded perfection. It contains many of their classics, and every song is a finely crafted pop-rock gem. Here's a bit of poetry from \\"We're a Happy Family\\":<br />\\"Sitting here in Queens/ Eating refried beans/ We're in all the magazines/ Gulping down Thorazines/ I'm friends with the president/ I'm friends with the pope/ We're al making a fortune/ Selling daddy's dope\\"<br />How can any rock lover resist the obvious, sugary-yet-substantial charms of \\"Rockaway Beach,\\" \\"Do You Wanna Dance,\\" \\"Cretin Hop,\\" \\"Locket Love\\"? (Well, apparently lots of \\"rock lovers\\" did just that, too busy buying up all that Kiss and Grand Funk Railroad and Fleetwood Mac swill in 1977). There's the nihilist's anthemic \\"I Don't Care,\\" a punk dirge in which Joey declares \\"I don't care about this world/And I don't care about these words.\\" \\"Ramona\\" is a bittersweet confection with a lovely melody.<br />And then there's the song that I consider to be the most perfect pop song ever written, \\"Sheena is a Punk Rocker.\\" An ode to free spirits everywhere, to New York City, and to the power of identity that the best rock'n'roll provides, \\"Sheena\\" is everything that makes the Ramones great in 2 minutes and 47 seconds:<br />\\"Well, the kids are all hopped up and ready to go/ They got their surfboards and they're heading/ to the Discotheque a Go-Go/ But she just couldn't stay/ She had to break away/ Well New York City really has it all Oh yea-ah, oh yeah!\\"<br />Second verse, same as the first. A put-the-top-down, fist-in-the-air, sing-along radio-friendly classic if ever there was one. However, when it was released as a single, radio stations took one look at the phrase \\"punk rocker\\" and recoiled in fear. Really. It's funny to think today that that phrase once struck horror into the stoutest of record company hearts, but it's true. Ah well, surely the less-threatening sounding \\"Rockaway Beach,\\" with its Beach Boys-go-garage vibe and unforgettable chorus (\\"Rock-rock, Rockaway Beach/It's not hard, not far to reach/ We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach\\") would leap to the top of the charts and ensconce the Ramones in the nation's warm bosom.<br />Except that this sunny, funny, delightful little ditty was released in the dead of winter. And it died. And that was it. The Ramones stopped cold. Despite relentless touring, the spectacle of Punk Rock was a dangerous one, and any band associated with it was thrown out with the bathwater. Plus, audiences outside of New York City's Lower East Side just couldn't get with four geeky-looking guys in motorcycle jackets, Captain America T-shirts two sizes too small and ripped-up blue jeans--not when there was John Travolta looking so suave and so dapper in his disco get-up!<br />The remastered version of this classic is beyond reproach--a booklet filled with photos I hadn't seen before and commentary by the illustrious Legs McNeil (\\"I mean, have you ever been to Rockaway Beach?\\" he writes. \\"The place is a sewer!\\"). Plus full lyrics, original record sleeve cartoons by John Holmstrom, and a nice little P.S. from Arturo Vega. The bonus songs are top-notch: the masterful \\"Slug\\" (this is a demo?!) and a slightly different version of \\"It's a Long Way Back to Germany\\" than the one on Road to Ruin. These are easily some of the finest re-issues on the market today--too bad Columbia didn't do the same when they redid the Clash catalogue last year.<br />So I say, screw disco and rock'n'roll forever! 1-2-3-4! Now the first four Ramones albums have been beautifully remastered, there's no reason for any home to be without 'em!ally. It's funny to think today that that phrase once struck horror into the stoutest of record company hearts, but it's true.

B000024D4R|5.0|.... ...Animals is underated. It is possibly the most poignant and biting socio-political albums i have ever heard. Dividing different people into animals sounds a little silly, but it works frighteningly well. I will always remember the first time i listened to Dogs, the lyrics took me by the throat and made ponder the evils of a free market. Pigs(3 different Ones) has even more viscous lyrics, and David Gilmour is fantastic on this song(he's great on the whole album). However, the real star of this album is Roger Waters. I think his lyrical abilities were at the peak, in the Animals/Wall/Final Cut era. His morbid and cynical insights made me shudder, and laugh. But I must say, Sheep is my favourite Pink Floyd song of all time. From the unassuming Keyboard intro at the start to the raucous, bordering on insanity guitar throughout. Waters' lyrics make me think of perhaps the Haulocaust, or maybe just everyday life, the way we are subjected to orders all the time, and we follow them without question.  This album is heavily influenced by Animal Farm by George Orwell, but it is also influenced by his other works, including 1984 and Bumese Days. This, along with WYWH, The wall, and The Final Cut, are thinking man's Floyd. Enjoy.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|THis has to be the first CHristmas album which won't put anyone in the Christmas spirit.  If this is Christina's kind of CHristmas, I want no part in it.  Christmas is supposed to be about nice, warm, cozy feelings, which she butchers with her vocal over-emoting, Mariah-Carey screeching, and over-extending of syllables in every possible part of a song (and in some impossible parts too).  Unfortunately from everything I have seen, this is her trend, so I am sure her next English album will be as heavy as a 10-ton brick because of her oversinging. Christina, ever heard of the saying &quot;Less is more&quot;?  You haven't have you?
B000006TRV|5.0|I cannot listen to this album in bits. For me, the album has no meaning unless you listen to the harrowing, semi-biographical rock epic from start to finish, disc one to disc two.<br />This album has ingrained itself in me. The story wraps itself around me, and by the time 'Outside The Wall' comes on, i am quite drained, it is a very strenous album. I will not say anything about how good and bad some songs are, because that does not do Roger Waters justice. Please, look at the album as a whole, and be amazed by easily one of the greatest rock albums of all time.<br />                           *by the way, to hear a sound bit of Roger Waters screaming and spitting at a fan in Montreal(forcing him to be disgusted by his actions and write 'The Wall')...
B00003CXRM|4.0|This is a rental. Clooney and the rest of the cast turn in fine performances, and the writing is quite good. But this movie doesn't stick in your mind like the Coens' better efforts.<br />Great movies have moments that stick with you long after the movie is done. In &quot;Barton&quot;, it's the flaming hotel hallway with John Goodman on a murderous rampage walking through it. In &quot;Fargo&quot;, it's a pregnant policewoman walking through snow drifts; a desperate woman trying to escape from kidnappers while wrapped in a shower curtain; a man being fed into a woodchipper. <br />This movie, while fun, and at some points quite funny, just comes up short on those kind of moments. Pretty good, just not great.
B000001E8S|1.0|&quot;Aaargh!!!&quot; I scream as the opening track &quot;United Colors,&quot; a meaningless, mind-numbingly boring track comes around again.  I'm listening to Passengers on my headphones, and I rip them off, and fire up amazon.com to write this review.<br />I love U2, and do agree with most when they say that U2's mainstream fans (although could there be a group more mainstream than U2, for Pete's sake?) bowed out on some of their most interesting stuff in the form of Achtung, Baby (especially) and others.<br />However, I've got to temper the rave reviews here with my own, reviews which I feel have only been brought on due to the hero worship some fans assign their favorite artists.<br />This album is boring, chock full of techno beats that go nowhere, merely incessantly repeating themselves.  The music neither moves you nor piques your curiosity, instead drolling on and on, until you can't wait to just turn your player off and reach for something more like, well, music!  &quot;Your Blue Room,&quot; while boring, is at least kind of like a song, and &quot;Miss Sarajevo,&quot; which I'd picked up on single in Geneva a few years ago, is by far the best track on the CD.  The rest is just so much noise ... subdued and yes - boring! - at that.<br />Perhaps I just don't &quot;get&quot; this creative side of U2, but by my account, this CD is a failure.  I respect an artist attempting to branch out, but I also feel that even the most accomplished artists should be looked at with a critical eye.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|UFO's live rendition here is absolutely flawless. Everything about this CD has already been well documented. Despite Michael Schenker's last guitar wizardry show off in 15 years (he re-appeared in UFO in 1995), the band still produced three top albums after Strangers in the Night. The sound was different but it was certainly the result of a much mature band. UFO consists of a rock band, not a single guitar player. Paul Chapman's guitar work in subsequent albums proved that UFO still peaked during that period (1980-1982).
0786703830|5.0|\\"Tether's End\\" is one of Margery Allingham's more atypical works. Rather than take their normal place as main characters, Albert Campion and Charlie Luke appear only occasionally. In each case they serve to provide vital context and to move the plot along, but they do not take part in direct action until the book is almost over.<br /><br />Instead the tale is about a seemingly unconnected series of killings which Luke is convinced are related somehow. A bus with a strange old couple in it is used to transport a victim from a crime scene and then vanishes. Another old couple sets out for South Africa and disappear. Jewelry from an unsolved murder turns up unexpectedly. All of these event seem to be related to Luke's old stamping grounds, Goff's Square, and Garden Green<br /><br />While Campion and Luke try to fit the pieces together, the narrator moves on, shifting from the murderer's point of view to that of several important and delightful characters. Annabel Tassie has come t!o London at the invitation of her Aunt Polly. Polly runs a museum of peculiarities that were originally collected by her late husband. Having never met Aunt Polly, Annabel calls on her Richard Waterfield, an old friend to keep an eye out for her. Richard, who is starting out his professional life in the big city, hasn't seen Annabel since he failed to marry her sister and is greatly affected by the changes in his old chum. I believe it takes him about 5 seconds to fall totally under her spell.<br /><br />It is Richard and Annabel who are the true main characters. Their separate adventures, Annabel with Aunt Polly, and Richard with the murderer that Luke and Campion are hunting, provide the main backdrop for the tense and chilling story of a killer who is gradually spinning out of control. Their paths weave through restaurants, clubs, barbershops, and city dumps until, at last, they come together in the small museum across from Garden Green.<br /><br />\\"Tether's End\\" is an intricate an!d thrilling tale, a disturbing look into the mind of a charming sociopath, and an intriguing study of London life at the end of the 1950's. As she did in \\"Tiger in the Smoke,\\" Margery Allingham turns from comfortable writing habits to show a rare expertise with psychological fiction. I like this book better than \\"Tiger in the Smoke,\\" but I'm quite confident that the Allingham fan will find both irresistible.turbing look into the mind of a charming sociopath, and an intriguing study of London life at the end of the 1950's.

B00003CXRP|5.0|&quot;Cast Away&quot; has become one of my favourite films, the acting is truly good, the film is very exciting, and also it has a preety good developing, that's what i like about the films from Robert Zemeckis, even though i have only seen &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Contact&quot;, &quot;What Lies Beaneath&quot; and now &quot;Cast Away&quot; i truly do think that he is a great director, the DVD is the best that i have ,i buyed at a Wal-Mart, it has everything you want,you get Dolby Digital  Surround  EX, DTS ES Digital Surround Sound, Dolby Stereo, French Dolby  Stereo track, spanish and english subtitles, an audio commentary by Zemeckis, and by the other crew, and you have four &quot;Making of&quot; features, all the TV spots, all the trailers are in there, and much more,and as i have told the audio  quality is top-notch, DTS as always sounds better than Dolby, but Dolby sounds preety good in this DVD.
B00004STPT|5.0|I have never been so moved by a soundtrack. <br />Lisa Gerrard sings in her own unique way, she sings from the heart and what we hear means nothing if taken literally, for example - what language is she singing in ? or what is it about ? but she means everything if she is listened to as another instrument in each song. Hans Zimmer has created his best work in this collection surely ?<br />Listening to this CD I cannot help get pulled in via my soul and emotionally moved. You live the music, you live the vocals, the sounds, the echoes. There is something untouchable and unexplainable about why so many people love this disc. Maybe it contains the essence of what it means to be truly human, a good human. What life entails and how we survive it no matter what happens to us. Just like the movie. The sounds soak into us and it all means the same as this.<br />I dont know if someone who hasnt seen the movie will appreciate or experience this music as well as someone who has. In my opinion it actually can stand alone just as well, as an excellent work of art in itself.
B000002HJC|5.0|Jim Morrison is one of America's greatest poets. Hemingway, Elliot, Emerson, Thurou and Morrison. Even if you've never read his books, this record contains his best. In fact, his exceptional writing and feeling is not even needed with music from Ray, John and Robby (although it's good to have the beat and rhythm to Morrison's soul). It's one of his and the door's greatest accomplishments and should be listened by fans of both.
B00005B4GU|5.0|It is difficult to write as a critical listener without sounding like a critic.  It is equally difficult to write as a fan or music lover with out gushing and sounding melodramatic.  Is Amnesiac one of the best albums I've heard recently?  Yes.  It is indeed five-star material. <br />Considering this album in a vacuum is impossible.  Kid A haunts the back of your mind.  Comparisons are inevitable and, with the inclusion once again of &quot;Morning Bell&quot;, seem invited.  I believe Amnesiac is the superior album, but there are songs I prefer on Kid A (for example &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; and the Kid A version of &quot;Morning Bell&quot;).<br />These albums, as many before me have pointed out, are not electronica.  Certainly, the instrumentation has changed and grown from the palette used on OK Computer, and even the song structure itself.  But the new songs, particularly on Amnesiac, are organic.  The sound is organic, the thought progression, the untranslatable feeling evoked by the blend of music and (sometimes nearly indecipherable) text, the structure of the album, all seem organic.  The moment I heard the opening of &quot;Packt like sardines . . .&quot; I knew that this album had deepened and broaden what was done on Kid A.  Indeed, unlike a few other reviewers, I am surprised that these songs came out of the same sessions as Kid A.  There seems to have been growth on the bands part from that record to this.  Perhaps Amnesiac is cut from the cloth, but Radiohead have learned to sew better..<br />Radiohead's impeccable musicality is paramount on this album.  Critics who call the music on either Amnesiac or Kid A &quot;a-rhythmic&quot; or say that it lacks melody probably can't keep a beat or hum a tune on pitch.  These songs do stay with you, in your head and on your lips.  The rhythms are complicated indeed, but you can still tap your foot if so inspired.  And the music is far from atonal (lord knows I've walked around humming and whistling Pyramid song and even bursting into &quot;I'm a reasonable man/get off my case&quot; particularly at work).  <br />At times, yes, the computer sounds outweigh the traditional and dissonance overtakes the melodies.  But it is Radiohead's ability, in the middle of all this apparently chaotic noise, computer generated beeps and harsh percussive passages, to suddenly surprise the listener with consonance, with a swell of strings, other traditional instruments, or even the strange haunting beauty in Thom Yorke's voice that reveals to the listener the soul trapped inside all the machinery, a soul which is all the more beautiful because it is contrasted by gloomy atmosphere and alien sounds.
B00004YKSD|4.0|Oliver Stone's The Door's is a movie where you might sometimes not be able to tell the difference between the real, surreal and bizzare, but as a whole, the movie presents a often coherent and sprawling tale of the legendary rock group.  And although the film is called the doors, don't be mistaken that every band member gets equal screen time.  Sure there are moments when they are indeed a &quot;tribe of warriors&quot; as Morrison puts it, but indeed Stone puts most of the focus on Moorison himself and what might've led to his destruction.<br />This is helped immensly by Val Kilmer, exceptionally paying attention to every Jim Moorison detail and very nicely mirroring Meg Ryan's portrayal of Pamela Susan Moorison.  Also, the music scene is very acurately depicted in the film for those interested, with a funny moment involving a Ed Sullivan look a-like.  The only flaw is that if you already knew a good amount about the Doors, the insight is actually quite little.  But of course, that's only for those who know alot.  If this is your first time ever watching or hearing anything by the Doors, you will indeed be blown away (and that might even go for some who know about the Doors anyway).
0805047905|5.0|I remember loving this book as a child, and reading this to my six-month-old son brought back wonderful memories. Yes, there's a simplistic theme running through the pages, but a young child listens for the repetitive phrase and looks for the big, colorful images. My son gets very excited each time I read the book to him, reaching for each of the animals as the page turns; and as he gets older and can comprehend the pictures better, I'm sure he'll appreciate Martin and Carle's work as much as I did.<br />I highly recommend this delightful book.
0783219172|4.0|The biggest complaint about this film is 'its not scary'.  Well, o.k its not.  But don't dismiss it just because of that! This film is a great blend of special effects, dark comedy, romance, suspense and mystery.  Few films can juggle all those genres and suceed, and this is one of them.<br />If you're into dark comedy and/or subtle humor, rent this movie.  Its not roll on the floor laughter, but if you're a fan of ironic humor, try this film.
B00003CXN4|4.0|I'm not gonna waste your time recapping the story, telling you how great the film is. It's wonderful.<br />I will say that the only thing missing for me was a director's commentary track. There's a \\"behind the scenes\\" section of the dvd, but that's not enough for me.<br />I think-okay, KNOW, that Soderbergh is one of the most thoughtful and intuitive directors of our time. And for someone like me, who uses dvds as a film school of sorts, I found this greatly disappointing. It's a walk inside Soderbergh's brain that I didn't get to take... <br />I would guess that sometime down the road, there's gonna be a Criterion re-release of this film on dvd, ala \\"Boogie Nights,\\" complete with supplemental material, and hopefully, a commentary.

B00005JGAB|5.0|It's hard to improve on perfection, but that's just what the visionaries over at Rhino have done with this remastered, expanded version of the Ramones eponymous debut album, an album that in its original version, shook the very foundations of rock and roll and brought it to its knees.  Although reportedly in the works long before the death of Joey Ramone, it's hard not to look at this and the rest of the Ramones re-issues as anything but a tribute to his and the rest of the band's genius.  Contains eight bonus tracks, including three demos (&quot;I Don't Care,&quot; &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue,&quot; and &quot;You Should Never Have Opened That Door&quot;) previously unavailable anywhere, two only available on &quot;All The Stuff (And More), Volume One,&quot; two previously available on a Norton vinyl single, and the single version of &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop.&quot;  The overall sound of the original album is cleaned up a little, but is still raw enough to satisfy purists.  Should be required listening in junior high schools nation-wide...
6305754950|4.0|This picture was shot in Academy ratio (which approximates TV), not widescreen format, and Hawks composed his shots in that format.  The picture was shown in theaters by using a &quot;matte&quot;, which cuts the top and bottom of the picture off to imitate Panavision.  Therefore, the &quot;widescreen&quot; DVD actually reduces the amount of picture area (just compare it to the full screen VHS print: you get the same width of picture, but the top and bottom are cut off and the composition looks wrong.)  El Dorado looks much better in full screen format, so buy the VHS.  The same is true of films like Batman, Jurassic Park and The Lost World.  Only James Bond movies seem to be shot in actual widescreen anymore.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I LOVE this soundtrack but it REALLY, REALLY (BAZ, I hope you are reading this) needs a Moulin Rouge 2 CD with the rest of the fabulous music from the movie.  ALSO, where the heck are the words!  For ...I expect the words to be on the CD jacket...especially to Lady Marmalade--since not even the stars seem to know what the words are--how are WE supposed to learn what the heck they are saying!  <br />A definite 5 star album but loses a star for not being a 2 CD set and for the lack of the words to the music!
0812550706|5.0|This was one of the best boks i have ever read. It has emotion action and war.  Probably the best book ive ever read.<br />You just cant put the book down...  READ THE SEQUELS<br />NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD BUT STILL MORE ENDER  AND MOR EENDER IS GOOD!!!
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|I like movies a lot and I'll sit through almost anything.  Thus, \\"Scary Movie\\" achieved something very rare when it got disgusting enough to make me turn it off and put the DVD back into the rental box.  If you are looking for a totally tasteless flick, this is for you.  As a comedy, it has a rare funny moment (in the first hour I saw), but you can find far better ways to spend your time.  On the positive side, I see it has a sequel out.  Most sequels are inferior to the original, but I don't think that can happen in this case.
B00005LB9O|4.0|For anyone who's been paying close attention knows that \\"invisible\\" is the last thing they have been lately, earning a massive acclain and a Brit 'home land' Award for last year's single \\"The Man Who\\". Anyway, they did had a good timing to coincide \\"The invisible band\\" album's release with their North American tour which began this month (June '01).<br />\\"Sing\\" is definitely a standout track and after it's soaring and banjo-scibbled rocker appeal, you would find yourself \\"sing, sing, singing\\" to this tune all day long. Softrocking tunes like \\"side\\" and \\"pipe dreams\\" are totally stuffed with instrumentals and touchy feely vocals with a subtle blending of accoustic strums and electric lead lines. The new songs 'Flowers In The Window', 'Safe' and 'Dear Diary' are very passionate and powerful ballads which are simple yet melancholy melodious with perfect playing despite unimpressive sound. \\"The Cage\\" is classic Travis melody with great vocals on a hounting chorus. \\"flowers in the Window\\" is a end to end love-song while seagulls caw and oceans splash in the back.<br />All in all, Travis is again giving out the same sound which drew fans to Radiohead. And, I kinda see them as a shadow band for Radiohead. But the difference to note here is that Radiohead albums are more intense and require repeated listening while Travis's pop-rock approach is very visible. They have figured a way to get some Radiohead fans, plus more with a catchy appeal and adventurous art in their albums.
B00005LMBK|3.0|Who cares if the band technically doesn't exists. That doesn't mean that this cd isn't still a good one to own. If you've heard Clint Eastwood and enjoyed it, then most of the CD is just as good. Track 6, Man Research (Clapper), is a really good. Another one is Dracula with it's slow, creamy smooth feel and catchy lyrics. And this disc isn't finished in 30 minutes, no sir. It's a full 70 minute CD which is a hootin' deal. Another perk is the enhanced portion of the CD. Once it's inserted into the computer, you're taken to Murdoc's Winnebago which is filled with nifty little features like an exclusive screensaver. Some may say that it's nothing more than another Blur album, but I say if that's how it comes off to you, then fine. If you like Blur, then pick this up, you won't be sorry, and if you are sorry, then I'm sorry.
B000005HNQ|5.0|How do I decsribe this album? Beautiful? Melodic? Powerful? All of the above? I will just say all of the above and then some. I originally thought of the Gathering as another doom/goth band along the lines of Theatre of Tragedy and Lacuna Coil. But I was suprised upon reading the lyrics which, in my mind, are not very doomy at all. They are not uppity either, though, which is a good thing. Rather they all have to do with nature in some way, be it snow, birds ect. From the opening guitar grind of &quot;On Most Surfaces&quot; to the final piano outro of &quot;Shrink&quot; this album carries a power and beauty rarely seen today in the music industry. The entire band plays as one unit while Anneke's vocals soar above them. She easily has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. I say this because it almost brings tears to my eyes everytime I listen to it. Doro is second but that is neither here nor there. Everything about this album rocks. The drumming good, the guitars and bass rock, and I like the grand piano. So don't be afraid to try this album out. It is forty-eight minutes of sheer metallic, melodic beauty.
0062513346|1.0|i am one of paulo coelho's greatest fans when i saw this book in the bookstore couldnt think of any other thing exept that i wanted to go home and start reading ..after the first twenty pages i discovered that it has nothing similar to the alchamest on the contrary, to me this book appeared to be very boring, a waste of time .it wasnt worth my exitment about it in the first place .i don't advise anyone to read it it is not believable,even the parts where supposedly paulo was conversing with his angel were very shallow .paulo and his wife chris are too boring .i felt very happy that i have finished this stupid book,so that i can start another one to make make me forget my dissappointment about coelho.
0671027344|5.0|I discovered this book via word-of-mouth. After reading numerous raves about it on various teen-related sites, I finally decided to purchase the book. I drove all over town until I found a copy - and was it ever worth the trip. I was hooked from page one when Charlie explains why he is writing anonymous letters to this unnamed (age and gender unknown) person. This book works on many different levels. Some of its story turns are very subtle. What we see is the perspective of a 16 year old boy - what is important to THIS person. These aren't necessarily things that an outsider looking in on his life might deem important. Indeed, Charlie seems to downplay some very major events in his life - but eventually it all comes together and the full picture emerges. The voice here is clear and engaging, funny and smart and heartbreaking. For anyone who understands that being a teenager is not just an age but a state of mind. For anyone who has ever felt infinite ...
B00004U8P9|5.0|Well, I can't say too much about this DVD set.  The packaging is outstanding, and the extras are great.  But, the biggest stand-out of the entire set is the movie itself.  Come on, it's The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I bought this set simply from word-of-mouth from other fans.  I had never seen the movie.  What I saw the first time I watched it was amazing.  It is unbelievable, and I love it!  I recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I went and saw this movie, and immediatly went out and bought the soundtrack! I love it.. It's quite diverse... Ewin and Nicole sing amazingly well ( I was /so/ surprised!! ) I think the only song I really dont' care for is Children of the Republic, but even that song is good!<br />I do wish there were a few more songs on the CD, or that they come out with a 'real soundtrack' (ie. One with /all/ the songs/sung parts on it) Cause I know I would buy that in an instant!!
6305736650|5.0|I don't know how I can expand on all of the praise that's already been given to the film, but I'll try. I've never seen the movie completely until a few weeks ago. I truly enjoyed it to the extent that it ranks in the top 5 of my favorite movies. It doesn't have a lot of action or suspense. What it does have is a great script, suberb acting by all and deservedly minimal direction. Honestly, I'm not a huge Bogart fan - I think he was way over-the-top in Maltese Falcon, but in Casablanca he is truly a gem to watch. I can feel for his pain and suffering as he relives old feelings. Ingrid Bergman is always a pleasure to watch and she shows why she was one of the best leading ladies in Hollywood. The rest of the cast is also good, even Peter Lorrie in a very small (but important) role. This movie tells a story that is still relevant today - it's all about the decisions you make in life. How some of them are not the best and if you're lucky, you may get a chance to redeem yourself later. Wether the story is set against the backdrop of World War II or today, it's still a story that has meaning to everyone. I bought this just to see what all the fuss was about. Boy did I ever &quot;get lucky&quot; with this one.
B000059TEP|5.0|It is definitely a 5 star movie. Since it was released I've watched it 15 - 20 times but still bought to have it in my collection forever....  It is a timeless piece and I would recommend it to movie lovers.
0780626966|5.0|THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series is one of the best horror film series ever. This is one of the best box sets ever. Freddy Kruger knows how to haunt and scare people. My favorite NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET movies is Parts 1,2,3 and the lasts two films. This is a good buy, the eighth disc is something else. This is a good christmas present. One of my good friends watched the first one and she threw up when Johnny Depp's character gets sucked into his bed and blood comes out. I recommend this movie to any who likes horror films and FREDDY KRUGER.
0679720200|3.0|Remove this book from the constraints of the ideological paradigm it has been placed in, either by its authour, or by subsequent intellectuals or book lovers, and see it as a story that happens every day amongst and between people in this modern world.  Conformity, guilt before the trial, assumptions and presumptions, the multifacted nature of an action- no one truth but rather dependant on the angle and experience of the observer. This is what Camus's book offers to the modern reality. <br />There is no discernable hero in this book- either one admires the main character for the 'realness' and truth of his actions and the envious unblemished connection that exists between his feelings and his words and deeds; or one pities him for not being able or willing to play the game of human and societal expectation. For in the end he is but the only one that really admires his propensity for raw honesty and individualism- or is he even capable of that?<br />In the end he is not able to save himself from the prison sentence and is it not an even more horrendous act to be publicly castigated for a misread crime, than to somewhat compromise ones ideals and 'play the game' in an effort to be saved- to be free? Especially in this case where the main character's actions and apparent amoral position seems to be less of an honourable position and more the reality of a tired -almost broken -man.<br />Maybe something was lost in the translation but I was not as moved by this book as I anticipated. Despite its existentialist label, it would still have been good for the book to leave you with some semblance of feeling that you had to search to find hidden meanings- the prose is simple (though not simplistic), and very transparent- but as i said- I think i may have expected a bit more.
0790734060|5.0|I cannot even begin to describe my admiration toward this film.  It is one of Milos Forman's greatest works and can never be duplicated.  The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is fascinating,  incredibly re-made by the creative team of AMADEUS.  The real story behind the movie is the playwright himself,  Peter Shaffer,  who adapted his Tony Award Winning play into an incredible film.  It shows how brilliant he is.  The story centers around Antonio Salieri(a once successful composer and now a suicidal old man,  who tells his story from within a mental hospital,  a favorite spot for Milos Forman's films.  He believes he is responsible for Mozart's death,  so he recounts the tale of his longing to become a servant of God,  to write music and sing His praises.  Upon hearing Mozarts music,  he believes Mozarts work is the voice of God,  but once he sees that Mozart is a vulgar,  childish,  spoiled young man with an amazing gift,  he begins to think dreadful thoughts of how he can rid himself of this &quot;creature&quot; whom he detests.  This film won the 1985 Oscar for Best Picture,  along with seven  other Oscars including Best Director,  Best Adapted Screenplay,  Best Costume,  and most importantly,  Best Actor.  As Salieri,  F.  Murray Abraham is astounding.  His performance is a revelation of jealousy and wanting that never falters.  I must admit that it is a little sad that while Abraham was winning nearly every Best Actor award that year,  his fellow Oscar nominee playing Mozart had to settle for many nominations,  but no wins.  Tom Hulce,  I feel,  gives a performance of a lifetime as Mozart,  and rightfully deserves much praise for his fiery and passionate Mozart.  He is a brilliant actor. Elizabeth Barridge,  though at times displays too much of a childish acting style,  is the vision of Mozart's wife and acts as an excellent foil between the two composers. The supporting cast is excellent,  headed by the always wonderful Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor,  ChristineEbersole(Recently won 2001 Tony Award for Best Actress in 42nd Street),  Barbara Byrne(Original Cast Member of Into the Woods),  Roy Dotrice(Played opposite Zero Mostel in A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To the Forum),  and Simon Callow.  It is a magnificent film and a must-see!
B000002MIY|5.0|I don't believe I have ever heard a chord progression as beautiful as the beginning verse of \\"On the Dunes\\". I don't believe I've ever heard a broken heart descibed better than this: <br />\\"Drive along the sea, far from the city's twitch and smoke. To, a misty beach, where  my life became a joke. On the Dunes. On the Dunes. Where rents are high, and seabirds cry, On the Dunes.\\" <br />Kamakiriad has the clever concept, fine writing, and impeccable musicianship asociated with everything Donald Fagen does.<br />One of the things I am really sick of is people who wouldn't know good music if it walked up and bit them on the butt. People who think a band is good if their politics are correct (i.e. The Clash) Or if they are appropriately snotty and obnoxious. (The Sex Pistols, The Ramones)Or if they are into the right fashions (Madonna, J. Lopez, etc) What is wrong with \\"Artists\\" (and I use that word loosely) like The Clash, Ramones, Madonna, J-Lo, Britney, all the \\"boy\\" bands, etc., is that they really aren't about MUSIC. Most of 'em can barely play their instruments. They churn out \\"product\\"...[Junk] for people who don't know any better and can't tell any difference. <br />This is absolutely NOT what Fagen is all about. This album, and \\"The Nightfly\\" as well, are incredibly well crafted, timeless, works of art. You can't listen to this album and not feel uplifted. BUY IT !!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the TURNING POINT for RADIOHEAD.  In this Album the band decided to look into the future.<br />Instead of staying stuck with playing the same style over and over again, they re-invented themselves.  This is a band that takes seriously the art of playing music. It's amazing to listen how they break all the standards and still manage to create music that is so fulfilling, so innovative and inspiring...<br />RADIOHEAD is always looking how to incorporate new sounds and new ideas into the music that they produce. Despite their critics, they are no longer just a regular band; they are musicians with vision whose final product BELONGS IN THE FUTURE. Defintely, this is a band that belongs in the XXI century and even beyond. Not in vain they have been called: THE WORLD'S GREATEST YOUNG ROCK BAND.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I've got to take back an earlier assessment of mine that George Clooney can't act.  He does a wonderful acting job in this movie and no one could have been more suprised than I was to discover him as an actor. Clooney forms a trio, along with John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, of fugitives from a chain gang in Depression era Mississippi. This is the ultimate road movie with characters throughout that could have only come from the Coens' incredible imaginations.  Real life is even interspered throughout with the trio catching a ride, for example, with \\"Baby Face Nelson,\\" the notorious manic-depressive bank robber. Ulysses Everett McGill is the name of Clooney's slick con man character and this is because this story is a retelling of the \\"Odyssey\\" via the Coen brothers.      Homer and the Coens together are a delightful combination, much more enjoyable than my reading of the source work back in high school.  The soundtrack of music from this era is fabulous too.  Our trio can even sing and makes a impressive debut as the \\"Soggy Bottom Boys.\\"  There are so many great scenes in this film that I could go on and on but I'll just highlight a few.  There is a Klu Klux Klan rally musical number that is only rivaled by \\"Springtime For Hitler\\" in \\"The Producers.\\"  It is a superb music and dance number of the proposed lynching of a black man!     Then there is the biblical flood that looms over all but in this case is the creation of the TVA dam.  The Coens manage to make creation of the TVA into high comic film art, no small feat. The trio also runs into the Sirens, just like happens in the epic poem.  In this case they are three damsels washing in the river and singing who beguile the trio.  From this encounter flows the comic wonder of Tim Blake Nelson over his belief that the sirens may have transformed Turturro into a frog. This is a must see film for everyone.

B00003CXB2|5.0|I don't remember how many times I have seen this movie.  The book, the characters, acting, camera work, art direction and music all comes together in a perfect symphony, watching this movie an unforgettable experience.  This is what movie making is all about.  The movie inspired me so much that I ended up studying Arabic language and living in the Middle East for three years.<br />The scene Omar Sharif first appears obscured by mirage is no doubt one of the best scenes in the movie history.
B00003CX5P|5.0|AWESOME movie, and just announced that they will release it on DVD on Oct 16, 2001. I CAN'T WAIT!!!
B00005B4GU|3.0|I started getting into radiohead in the period between OK Computer, and Kid A.  The first album I bought was The Bends, and then recieved OK Computer as a Christmas present.  Amnesiac is NOT OK Computer....  In my opinion, Radiohead have gone far enough with the experimental stuff, and can return to their regular music.  OK Computer and the Bends were both great albums, and perhaps they did not know what to do after them.  Making albums like Kid A and Amnesiac are just a way to make money to people who are willing to get away from the teen music made in the last few years.  Like a previous reviewer, I don't understand why Radiohead had to release 2 album for their Kid A &amp; Amnesiac sessions.  They could have gotten the 2 or 3 real good songs off Amnesiac and put them on the Kid A album to make a good follow up album to OK Computer.  But one of the reasons people like this album (in my opinion), is because of all the Radiohead hype.  Do not buy this album if you are expecting this to be equal to The Bends, OK Computer, or even Kid A!  Buy this only if you are a huge Radiohead fan, or if you like experimental music.  This is not the time to jump on the Radiohead bandwagon.
0399146253|5.0|I found this one hard to get into the first few chapters, because Kay just &quot;wasn't herself.&quot; But once I did get into it, I thought it was one of the best ever with quite a twist at the end!!
B00004SU5J|5.0|This album is unique amongst the deluge of Electronica that we are forced to pick through.  It is rooted heavily in jazz.  It has looped, trippy jazz vocals, and samples heavily.  That said, it is not another cookie-cutter &quot;Lounge&quot; album.  Clearly one of the best albums of last year, which I stumbled upon somewhat by mistake, and I'm very glad I did.<br />If you like Thievery Corporation and Air, you'll probably like this.  If you like Stereolab, you'll find that this incorporates many of the similar strains of jazz/funk, but it's less cacaphonous.  Really, it's beautiful. . . but it's not boring.<br />Buy it, listen to it, pass it on.  You won't regret it.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Somewhere in their career, someone rolled The Clash into a recording studio and produced &quot;London Calling&quot;, and the rest is human history. Producer Guy Stevens techno wizardry creates a freshly tarred, wall-to-wall stereophonic slice of happy pop culture stomping on shaky ground. This is 'The Clash' with a dollar pinned under their ear and lavish lip-licking commercialism in the briefcase. My original vinyl record even had a secret message. At the end of each four sides of vinyl, scratched in the ending groove were the consecutive words, TEAR-DOWN-THE-WALL. It was the year of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; and you couldn't get away from the hit single, &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;.
B00004S6GL|4.0|'Really?' I thought the first time I heard &quot;Figure 8.&quot; 'I didn't know Paul Simon recorded under a pen-name....'<br />The point is, rarely does an artist come around with such honesty, such integrity to his work. I'd say once every generation; Dylan, Simon, and Elliot Smith. Forget what you feel you know about perported &quot;production&quot; and &quot;orchestration,&quot; the supposed evils charged to Mr. Elliot on this, his latest attempt at yet another classy bit of acoustic genious. This is personified Elliot.<br />&quot;Son of Sam,&quot; it is said, was an attempt bring Smith to the mainstream, or for the music industry to wake up and come to him. Huh. Nothing doing. But listen to this masterpiece of ironic attack on Industrial America (note the colors used on the disc as well) and decide if it is truely a failure. Just as colorful and fresh is &quot;Junk Bond Trade,&quot; which smells like a second single, should Smith get past his introvertive obsession to keep himself small. But who wants one of the music industries most precious gems to be discovered anyway? &quot;Happy holidays,&quot; indeed. Quite a mixed bunch of songs, too, a la &quot;White Album.&quot; Everything from open, attractive glory (&quot;Happiness&quot; and the stellar &quot;LA&quot;) to his usual, quiet remorse over a love-lost (&quot;Somebody that I used to Know&quot; and &quot;Easy Way Out.&quot;)<br />If Smith expects his fanbase to continue to be small, his style unnoticed, and his status among musical media unnamed, he should stop putting out masterpieces like &quot;Figure 8.&quot; Bravo, Elliot.
B000002U82|5.0|Studies have been conducted on the success of Pink Floyd's classic, best-of-the-best &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;  Some results are as follows:  <br />*One in every 20 people under the age of 50 in the United States owns a copy of this album *Dark Side remained on Billboard's 200 album chart for an amazing 15 years straight and then for another two when it was remastered back in 1994 *It is currently the most successful album ever with upwards of 40 million copies sold world-wide<br />Now the question... WHY?  Why should one album by a band back in 1973 have such outstanding achievments and admiration even today?  Perhaps because of the time period.  Look at other albums released the same year by bands like Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, Rush, and the Doobie Brothers among several others.  This was the year of rock perfection.  Or maybe it was because of the rave for concept albums.  Or the simple, yet unforgettable album cover.<br />More likely it was the band's chemistry and ability to make jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring, thought-provoking music.  This is Pink Floyd at its collective finest, with everyone contributing.  Unlike the band in 6 years, Waters did NOT do everything.  Gilmoure took a huge chunk of the music-writing, laying down the chord progressions on &quot;Breathe,&quot; &quot;Time,&quot; and &quot;Any Colour You Like;&quot; the singing on the album's best songs, Water's conceeding to David's far superior voice; and pumping out what would later be hailed as some of rock's most influential lead-guitar riffs on &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage.&quot;  Wright got in on much of the writing as well with his keyboard contributions on &quot;Breathe,&quot; the symphonic &quot;Great Gig in the Sky,&quot; &quot;Us and Them,&quot; and the amazing keybpard licks and effects on &quot;Colour.&quot;  Mason, who rarely contributed, put in his efforts on &quot;Speak to Me,&quot; &quot;Time,&quot; and the Waters-less &quot;Colour.&quot;  Finally, Roger Waters put down most of the album's music, laid down all the bass-lines as usual, thought up the album's concept, and wrote all the lyrics.  If that's not enough, he made himself heard on &quot;Brain Damage,&quot; &quot;Eclipse,&quot; and the chorus of &quot;Time.&quot;  Anyway you put it, THIS is the true Pink Floyd; all contributing, all acknowledged.<br />The band's titanic success was continued on later albums like 1975's &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; 1977's &quot;Animals,&quot; and 1979's &quot;The Wall,&quot; although by that time the band had begun to fall apart from Waters' power obsession.  By 1983, the band had slipped to a Water's-solo-project version of itself, with &quot;The Final Cut,&quot; and finally a break-up.  But never would the band see the success or experience the musical genious of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;  So pop this in, take another listen, and remember- even if you don't believe the hype- after this album, music would never be the same....
B000000OTU|5.0|These guys ROCK, and this album proves it!  This a smokin' collection of great rock tunes from the late 80's to the early 90's.  Steven Tyler and Co. show why they have been around for 30 years and continue to entertain people all around the world.  This is their second collection of hits, and all of the greatest and biggest ones are here in this collection.  13 greatest hits include, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Janie's Got A Gun&quot;, &quot;Love In An Elevator&quot;, &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, &quot;The Other Side&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot;, &quot;Cryin&quot;, and &quot;Livin' On The Edge&quot;. These are all some of my personal favs, but I love the entire CD.  There are also 2 new cuts from '94, &quot;Walk On Water&quot; and &quot;Blind Man&quot;.  If you love great music, then you absolutely MUST have this album.  I also highly recommend their first greatest hits collection from the '70's. Pick both of these albums up, and get ready to rock AEROSMITH style!!!
B0000024SD|5.0|I think this is a masterpiece of music and i totally disagree with the brit in oxford. It shows how diverse he can be not to mention my favorite song &quot;It's all over now baby blue&quot;.
B000053ZRR|5.0|WATCHED THIS CONCERT DVD LAST NIGHT AFTER RECEIVEING IT IN THE MAIL. IT ROCKS !! ONE OF THE BEST CONCERT DVDS I'VE SEEN/HEARD. GREAT CAMERA WORK AND A FANTASTIC SHOW. JON, SAMBORA, AND THE GUYS ARE IN TOP FORM. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS WELL AS THE NEW LIVE CD. GREAT PRODUCTION VALUES.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Songs one and two were okay, but the third song &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving&quot; -- what is that supposed to mean, anyway? -- is just weird and irritating. After that I had trouble listening to the rest of this CD and I sold it right away because they grated on my nerves so bad. I don't know, maybe if you like this group, you'll like this CD, but personally, this kind of music is getting tired.
B00000899T|5.0|This import is incredibly good.  If you own the domestic version of this cd, you HAVE to get the import.  Just for the song Once in a While.  it's truly magical, especially after listening to Machina.  This song just reminds you of everything great and beautiful about the pumpkins.  Get it!
078322687X|5.0|This movie is probably my favorite of all time.  I own the VHS edition and the DVD.  The story revolves around 5 high school students who are forced to spend Saturday detention together.  Judd Nelson plays the criminal, Emilio Estevez is the jock, Molly Ringwald is the princess, Anthony Michael Hall is the brain, and Ally Sheedy plays the basketcase.  At the beginning of the movie they are total strangers with nothing in common, and by the end of the movie they each have bared their souls to each other and have become good friends.  This is a great dramatic comedy that is a can't miss for anyone who loves great movies.  These five actors have incredible chemistry, and this movie is an excellent showcase of their individual and collective talents.  Each actor gives a gripping performance especially Judd Nelson who is outstanding in his role as the criminal.  Directed by John Hughes, who also produced such classics as &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot;, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, and &quot;Weird Science&quot;.  &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is truly one of the &quot;new classics&quot; that never gets old.  If you have never seen this movie, you absolutely owe it to yourself to watch it.  Get this one and get ready to run with the &quot;Brat Pack&quot;!
B00003CXRM|2.0|I really like The Cohen brothers movies but I did not laugh out loud once during this movie.One of their least impressive works.I really wanted to like this movie but I was not inspired at all. One of those movies you neither love nor hate,which I hate! Get The Big Lebowski instead.Now that is a funny movie!
0316777722|5.0|I just heard David Sedaris read from this book on the David Letterman Show, and if the rest of the book is as funny as this it will be a good book! I alomst fell out of my chair laughing!! Oh my gosh i'm buying the book right now!
B00005JGAB|5.0|This is where it all began. If you don't own any punk albums,start here. This album has influenced more musicians than any other in the history of music. It's too bad Joey's not here to see these reissues. Thanks to Joey,Johnny,Dee Dee &amp; Tommy for this timeless classic. I give it 50 stars!!<br />P.S. - Blink 182 couldn't carry the Ramones jocks! That is not punk,it's pop.
B000002HK4|5.0|I've listened to quite a few prog rock marathons in my time (Shadow Gallery springs immediately to mind...), but this one is the best.  Change Of Seasons is an exetremely powerful song, and probably the only one DT has written that really shows off everything they can do.  LaBrie has vocal solos (V: Another World), Petrucci lets loose, (Darkest Of Winters, The Inevitable Summer); the band is strong throughout.     You could argue that Scenes From A Memory is better, but they're not really the same thing.  SFaM was an entire concept album; Change Of Seasons isn't that long or involved. But for me, this IS Dream Theater, and nothing else comes close.  The covers are great, and they really make the album, but it's all about Change Of Seasons.     This was the first DT album I bought, and it's the one that spends the most time in my CD player.
B00001NFCY|1.0|People keep writing things like SCOTT STAPP THINKS HE'S THE NEW EDDIE VEDDER...they never said that.  All creed did was realize they had talent, and took it to the road.  Its Scott Stapps voice, can he choose weather or not he sounds similar to Eddie Vedder or not?  NO. Just like Oasis and the Beatles.  You sound the way you sound.  And its obvious Both bands are successful.<br />And the fact that they are a christian band....so what.  They dont rub it in anyones face.  So the songs dont have killing references or swear words....sometimes we can use a little break from that.  Those of you who hate this cd...well no one asked you to buy it.  Try before you buy, and let those of us who LOVE creed, listen to them in peace.  I gave this one star just so you Creed haters could understand other points of view.  ROCK ON!
B00005BJPO|4.0|Akira is one of the classic japanese animes.  Beautiful, deep story, and full of action.  If you haven't seen Akira then you are in for a treat.  But be warned, the story can be a bit confusing the first time you see it.  It's a lot to take in and if you are just enjoying the animation you might find you've missed a piece of the puzzle.  This DVD is packed full of extras and worth having in anyone's collection.  Otaku or not.
0393314804|5.0|I read Trainspotting after watching the film, and although the film was brilliant, I think the book is superior to it.I was gripped by it and couldn't stop reading until it was finished.It is a masterpiece of bitter humour and harsh scottish vernacular;it brims with energy,poignancy,mordant wit.The dialogue is so powerful and the characters so believable and real,they are vibrating and reverberating in your mind long after you have finished it.Welsh gives voice to the downtrodden and invisible, living in the dumps of our modern,affluent western societies as they stammer,whisper and shout out their amputated dreams and their aborted hopes with aggressive tenderness and incendiary violence.
0441172717|5.0|Occasionally a person attains a moment of great clarity of vision and thought; much more rarely, this vision can be communicated to others. 'Dune' is such a vision clearly seen and expertly told.<br />As with most epics, 'Dune' can be appreciated on many levels. It is a story about the rite of passage of Paul Atreides from boy to man. It is a tale of the end of an age-old feud between two major Houses. It contains morals and warnings, politics and religion, loyalty and betrayal, and all of the things which have become the staple of truly great Science Fiction.<br />But the one thing that makes this book stand out is its clarity. Herbert had a story to tell, one he fully grasped, and he told it without extraneous details, without excessive dialog or inane side-plots. He revealed the secrets of Dune in a deliberate, timely manner, making every word count.<br />There are few works in Science Fiction that come close to what Herbert has written here. If you want to see the best of what Science Fiction has to offer, read this book.
B00004SU5J|5.0|This is the best album that I have purchased this year, hands down. Funk, house, and jazz define this album with the intersection called St. Germain's Place. The grooves and directional vibes orchestrated by St. Germain are perfectly tasteful. If you like funk and house but are not a jazz fan -- you will begin to appreciate jazz after listening to this album. Upbeat, but not too dance-like, the tracks found on this CD are a great mix of funk, jazz, and house. Pick up this album, sit back, and enjoy the ebb and flow of St. Germain's groove. Moving in stereo - d.i.roberts.
B00004XQ83|5.0|In a world where so much of our music sounds alike, it was truly refreshing to hear such a down-to-earth recording. I liked the movie so much I went out and got the CD immediately so I could listen to it on the way home. Any true music lover should be able to appreciate this collection of traditional, sure enough American artistry. My hat's off to the Coen brother's taste and intuition, and for bringing these gems to people who may not otherwise get the chance to be exposed to a heritage all Americans need to be proud of. I only wish we could see more movies and soundtracks as excellent as this one.
B00000DFSK|5.0|This is a must have for any music lover.  Many people are hearing U2 for the first time with the release of &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;.  If you are one of these people, do yourself a favor and find out how good they were from the beginning.   I found this CD while looking for some music to take for a  trip, there is so little good NEW music out there that this CD of old music is the best that I have bought in a VERY LONG TIME!! This CD is hard hitting and so full of powerful songs. Bono sings with so much feeling and such energy, this is the reason this group is still around and good.  This CD however, is a classic! . If my plane goes down this is the CD that I want to have with me.
0060392886|5.0|This book is a must for any Motley Crue fan and an excellent read for anyone interested in the music industry.  This band did everything and they did it to the extreme.  This book go into great detail about their drug addictions, alcoholism, women and inner band turmoil.  You'll find out about the surprisingly soft side the band has when you read about Vince's loss of his daughter, Nikki's bad childhood, Tommy's time in jail and Mick's crippling disease.  These guys have led a rock ' n ' roll life and they had had a hell of a time doing it and you'll have a great time reading about it.
B00005BL2A|4.0|I had thought Depeche Mode was over, fini, kaput - In fact, I didn't bat a single eyelash when I saw the CD in the checkout line at the music store _ &quot;yeah, whatever&quot; was my response, and I continued on my merry way.  But tonight I saw the CD on one of the listening stations at the same store, and I decided to stop and take a listen.  And, I felt like I had been taken back to the days of yore.  It was the same Depeche Mode I used to brood to back in high school - only better, fresher, infused with a long needed dose of inspiration and creativity.  Alive and kicking, and helping my inner adolescent get down and depressed just like the good old days.  ;-)
B00003CXAA|5.0|The first two Godfather films are 2 of the best films ever made. The second is the only sequel to win Best Picture. Those two pictures alone are worth the money. The third movie is also good, so this package is well rounded.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Halfway between the experimentation of Kid A and the hi-fi angst rock of OK Computer, this is a great album and a very worthy inclusion in the Radiohead collection:<br />&quot;Packt Like Sardines...&quot;: This midbeat, bass heavy techno track starts us off with its pessimistic, cynical lines &quot;After years of wating, nothing came/I'm a reasonable man, get off my case&quot;.<br />&quot;Pyramid Song&quot;: One of my absolute favorite Radiohead songs now. A very metaphysical drift through the gates of heaven, the fourth dimension or something like that. It was this song (and its equally mesmerizing video) that made me get the record.<br />&quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot;: A strange altered voice rambles about the many doors of life, including the 'trap doors that you can't come back from'. Scary and psychadelic. Reminds me of a great foreign TV series called the Kingdom, where 2 of the characters are retarted janitors who talk of the ghosts in their hospital ward. This is quite possibly one of the most peculiar tracks Radiohead has done.<br />&quot;You And Whose Army?&quot;: A flashback to the old days of Radiohead. Half Pink Floyd, half downtrodden 50s balladry. Moving.<br />&quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;: Religious confusion and spiritual existenstialism seem to be the topic here. The most 'rock-oriented'. Reminds me vaguely of Pixies' &quot;Down To The Well&quot; on Bossanova.<br />&quot;Knives Out&quot;: Seems to be about being stranded out on an artic tundra and having to turn to drastic measures to survive, such as eating a good friend who has rot out in the snow or catching a mouse that passes by. A grim apocalyptic prophecy? This is another return to their early sound.<br />&quot;Morning Bell&quot;: This too is metaphysical and spiritual. The Kid A version was more or less a fast-paced escape from hell, while this has a 'reflect and repent' touch.<br />&quot;Dollars and Cents&quot;: We are what we work. We are our own money. We are our productive efficiency. This song is all bout that, and how businessmen are hollow underneath. 'Scarecrows. Supply and demand. Credit. Voters...'<br />&quot;Hunting Bear&quot;: Odd, tiny instrumental which sounds as if it were meant as a bside. Basically guitar over sound effects and wind.  Could it be those adorable creatures from the booklets?<br />&quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;: The second most interesting track on the album. Yorke explains the act of dying as political lions tear him to shreds. It actually sounds like a backtrack into death where time is reversed and angels hide in the the backworlds invisible to the trained eye (poetic rambling)...<br />&quot;Life In A Glasshouse&quot;:With music resembling early Tom Waits New Orleans jazz and grim lyrics of hipocricy and heiarchy (The mantra is 'Ofcourse I'd like to sit and chat/Ofcourse I'd like to stay and chew the fat&quot;), the album comes to a great end.
B0000029D1|5.0|I have been a big fan of Stanley Clarke since the '92 PPV broadcast of the Seville, Spain Guitar Legends concert. He only played \\"School Days\\", but it was enough to plant the seed of jazz in me. From there I discovered John McLaughlin, Al DiMeola, Stanley Jordan, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Louis Jordan, Brian Lynch and many others. Each new player I found introduced me to a handful more jazz greats, but it was Clarke that introduced me to jazz. <br />Clarke brings along guitarist Larry Carlton, drummer extraordinaire Billy Cobham, Deron Johnson on keyboards, and the multitalented Najee playing anything he can get his mouth on. Then, the fun begins. The quintet knows exactly what they are doing on stage together. The music they produce is an incredible whirlwind of straight jazz, funk, and great playing. <br />The twenty-one minute version of \\"School Days\\" is a tour-de-force of power. Beginning with a duet between Cobham and Clarke they trade lines of percussion back and forth. As the piece moves, it evolves to include the rest of the band. Everyone takes turns soloing. \\"School Days\\" is still a playground for Clarke's funky slap bass playing, and he (as well of the rest of them) will leave you with your jaw on the floor. The group does a stunning cover of Miles Davis' \\"All Blues\\". Najee begins on the flute giving over to Johnson's piano before Carlton steps up to solo, and Clarke takes a solo of his own. They are not only players, but writers too as they cover a song written by each member group, (except Johnson).  <br />This is, hands-down, my favorite Clarke album that I own. You can feel the soul and power that permeates the air as these five play. They play off of each other well, and they are really enjoying themselves. With friends like this, who would have an enemy?
B000004CYT|4.0|I have been familiar with Hogwood's Beethoven cycle since the 80's when I purchased several of the single disc releases. Now that I have the complete set, it has been wonderful listening to the symphonies in sequence. This set has many virtues. The tempi all seem right, there is plenty of forward momentum without ever sounding rushed or breathless. There is great definition and inner detail. The winds cherp and warble while the brass bray. After all, contemporary critics accused Beethoven of bringing the marching band into the concert hall. That sound is very much in evidence in these performances. Symphonies 1-2 are very good, 3-6 are excellant, although 7-8 are not quite up to the standard of the earlier performances, are still enjoyable. The 9th is also a most excellant performance. These performances illuminated the joy inherent in these symphonies. One minor caveat, the maniacal side of Beethoven is some what under played. The fate motive in the 5th does not really sound threatening as it has no time to linger. That being said, this is a most enjoyable Beethoven cycle to add to my Karajan '62 and Szell. Gardiner's Beethoven may have all the hype, but Hogwood's tempi, inner detail, recorded sound and balance truly bring out the &quot;revolutionary&quot; aspects of these great works.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorillaz is A clash of rock, hip hop, regee, and everything in between. It all comes together to make great music. There are great vocals from the front man 2-D ( damon Albarn) and Hip hop beats coming from the drummer russel. All this Backed by there 10 year old Chinese guitarist Noodle And there satan obseesed bassist Murdoc they make for a great band. I reccomend this to anyone who just likes good music.

B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones first album is a true rock-n-roll classic! It's significance cannot be understated. This album influenced thousands of rock artists! This is the album that started the whole punk movement! I have played this album thousands of times over the years and I still get goosebumps everytime I hear the opening chords to &quot;Today your Love, Today the World.&quot; The songs are incredible mix of high powered straight forward punk music and 60's pop sound. Every rock fan should own this indredible recording. Every Ramones fan probably has 2 copies already ( I  own 3.)  Gabba gabba hey!
B000007PI9|5.0|When I saw this video at blockbuster I had to tent it. The cover is outstanding, was the first thing I thought. When I got home I turned the tv on and watched it. After seeing the movie ten times I had to return it. For the next week there was something different, I didn't have Cobra! I came to this website and a bought won as fast as Stallone climbed those stairs in Rocky! As I tell people, I am a mix of Sylvester Stallone and Chuck Norris. They are my favorite actors. Now I tell all of you to buy this movie and not see it like ohter critics but see it in the light of good, see it with thrill and gold! Believe in the plot, be the plot and whatever you do don't stop watching Cobra because it is a disease, its addictive!
076790382X|1.0|I was taken by all the great reviews, but its really not that good. It is disjointed and has way too much statistical information - which worked well for the newspaper articles  - but not for a book... Bryson is a good author though, Sunburned country is his best and well worth the read... This book however should be missed.
0440180295|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Mr. Vonnegut and if all his books are like this one I think I'm in for a special treat.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.  It's very easy to read.
0684833395|5.0|This book can be difficult to read because it is filled with humor.  You will constantly be rereading paragraphs to make sure you read correctly.  Heller will show you some of the silliness of humanity and western culture.  This book is excellent light reading for anyone over 14, but its meaning is powerful.  A Classic.  Long Live Yossarian!
B00005J6T0|3.0|I haven't listened to this remastered version, though I'd like to, but I must say that I spent most of my girlhood dancing around my basement to this album. In fact, I think it was one of two tapes I listened to for 2 years straight. (The other one-- actually a record, not a tape--was Footloose, the Soundtrack. Though my musical tastes have drastically change, I still like this album in all its pop fluffiness. However, the only song I think is genuinely magical is &quot;Live to Tell&quot;. I love it just as much as I did back then. The only ridiculously bad song is &quot;Jimmy Jimmy.&quot; It gives me the willies. Skip over it.
0140177396|5.0|One of Steinbecks shortest novel, but one of the best.  This novel will broaden the reader's perspective and touch the heart.  This novel is Powerful and emotional.
0684800713|5.0|The Sun Also Rises is a perfect example of Hemingway's unique prose style. The author etches a visually intense picture of the Fiesta, and he does it with remarkably few adjectives. His characters are made real by what he has not written, and by dialogue left unsaid.  <br />The story is reminiscent of Sartre's 'Age of Reason'. Both books portray angst-ridden young people in Europe between the wars, their desires, attitudes and relationships. There are many other parallels. Hemingway's book  is more penetrating, and less pessimistic. It's definitely worth reading.
0140186409|5.0|This is of course an American Literary Masterpiece.  I would highly recommend this novel.  It may seem wordy if you are a slow reader.  Steinbeck can get that way.  This novel will give the reader great insight into the 1930s agrarian culture.
B000001E7V|2.0|tricky laid out a number of great tracks when he was with massive attack. this solo work shows he needs the influence of the other massive members to provide diversity and listenability to his music.  in my opinion, there's only one good track on the album \\"abbaon fat track.\\"  the others are just one slow monotonous song that makes one quickly realize they just wasted [money].
B000059MEK|5.0|Every song on Daft Punk's 'Discovery' is unique - no two songs sound alike. Daft Punk (in my opinion) really knew what they were doing when they put this album together; it's a wonderful expression of their love for dance music. My two favorite songs on here are &quot;Digital Love&quot; (#3) and &quot;Face To Face&quot; (#13).<br />&quot;Digital Love&quot; combines disco themes with classic rock a la Manfred Mann's 70's hit, &quot;Blinded By The Light&quot; - there's even a virtuoso guitar solo in the middle of the song. I hope &quot;Digital Love&quot; ends up being a single; I really, really like this one.<br />&quot;Face To Face&quot; is pure 80s, with a millenial feel to it. It combines elements of early Prince with a touch of New Order. This is my favorite song on the album...I wish it was longer.<br />Other tracks I must mention are &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; (#2), &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; (#4), and &quot;Crescendolls&quot; (#5) [this song is zany, but I like it anyway]<br />If you enjoy songs like &quot;Lady&quot; by Modjo (sounds like George Michael to me), &quot;I'll Fly With You&quot; (Gigi D'Agostino) or ATC's &quot;Around The World (La, La, La, La, La) - you'll appreciate this. Most (if not all) dance music fans are already familiar with track #1, &quot;One More Time&quot; by now; when you listen to it, it does feel like a celebration, doesn't it?<br />Just close your eyes and let this album take you away...<br />C.H.R.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|After seeing the movie twice, I knew I had to get the CD, which has completely lived up to the movie's quality.  I was disappointed that the lyrics were not included with the CD and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and&quot; Spectacular Spectacular&quot; were not on the CD.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were absolutely amazing, and the CD is wonderful!
B00004YW6I|5.0|Best artist out in years.  &quot;You Said Something&quot; made me break down and cry first time I heard it (maybe you have to be from NYC for it to have that effect).  For those of us into rock that comes from some inner depths, PJH is a soulfull breath of fresh air in a field of overprocessed... well you know the rest.
0440539811|3.0|This is a book that you'll either love or hate... I read this around 1977(?), at the time there were about four of us reading it and it provided a great deal of conversation fodder. It's childish/brilliant in its attempt to tie every conspiracy together in a big sex/drugs/and rock n roll gumbo. Of course, now it seems very dated and silly. Or is it? I do thank Shea and Wilson for indtroducing a lot of folks to the idea that all is not what it seems (fnord) but I think the REAL truth is much more scary.
0884271153|4.0|Goldratt has written an inspiring novel that illustrates how his Thinking Processes can help you find common-sense solutions to problems. In the story, protagonist Alex Rogo keeps three of his company's unprofitable units from being sold by applying the Thinking Processes to devise startling turnaround strategies, and then by seeing that those strategies were implemented. He also successfully applied the Thinking Processes to challenges he faced at home.<br />This book gives some insight into how to use the Thinking Processes, but does not explain them in detail.
B000059ZLH|5.0|The complaints about the audio/video not being state of the art to take advantage of home theater systems and giant TV's, in my opinion, though valid, are pretty small complaints. If you have volume control on your TV and the screen is larger than 12inches, you are not going to miss out on anything. I have my DVD hooked up to my stereo and the sound is crisp and plenty loud (even without going through the stereo, TV speakers do just fine. Again, I refer to that old fashion volume control button). The stage is not very large, so any advantage of having the video in widescreen or 16x9 is minimal at best.  <br />As for the DVD content (which I think should be the emphasis here) it is fantastic. If you own the &quot;5 Years In a Livetime&quot; video, you will notice a considerable difference in the quality of the show. In a matter of two years, one of the best live bands around has managed to increase their live prowse further. Those who complained that Rudess and Myung were underused on &quot;Scenes Of A Memory&quot; CD should take note of this DVD. Not only is that assessment grossly inaccurate, both Rudess and Myung are intricate to the essence of the &quot;Memory&quot; sound. Rudess's keyboard work is consistently married with Petrucci's guitar, adding depth and texture to every note. Though I could tell this marriage had taken place on the CD, the DVD helps to show to those critics that Rudess was indeed sufficiently present on the album. Also, Myung's excellent bass work is imperative to the depth and richness of the more emotional notes. His bass licks, just as Rudess keyboard, was interwoven in with the guitar and keyboard to give us that Dream Theater power. Portnoy is his usual, masterful self and Petrucci continues to show he is the most technically proficient and talented guitarist in the prog-rock arena. James Labre has never sounded better. I thought of all the players, his performance has markedly improved from the 5 years video. He has pipes that are theenvy of every arena rocker out there.<br />I could go on and on, but I think the point is made. Get this DVD as soon as you can!!
B00003CXRP|1.0|Never got to see it on the theater but I did rent the DVD. The DVD has a many interested features. Details on the production and interviews with survival experts. It is a good DVD.<br />The one star is because I didn't like the movie. If you liked Cast Away. You will love the DVD. If you are like me and appreciate nothing about the movie, or if you haven't seen Cast Away. Rent first. I'm very glad I did.
B00005LB9O|5.0|travis plays the game carefully with another hummable opus whose strengths focuses on ethereal melodies that modern music lacked. there's not a hint of making ventures to musical territory here, and still shows loyalty to a given formula prevalent from their previous effort &quot;the man who&quot;. travis may remain true with their songcraft but were able to draw fresh new songs and not repeating themselves in the process. the tracks that stood out for me were &quot;sing&quot;, &quot;side&quot;, &quot;flowers in your window&quot;, &quot;last train&quot; and &quot;pipe dreams&quot;. the rest were just lovely.  there's one thing i'd like to point out while i'm at it. i'm suppose to give 4 stars only, since the latter part of the album was very mellow for me, if only they put more uptempo songs.  the extra star was for the two bonus tracks included on this limited edition i got. anyway it still is a marvelous piece of work! enjoy!!!
0517122707|5.0|What a same that John Kennedy Toole wont be providing any more wonderful novels.  This book rates as one of my new favorites and certainly deserves the praise it has been given. This book is very refreshing in that it deals with psychologically complex characters without giving into modern judgments of their actions.  Confederacy also manages to portray a very small character with a very small life in an epic manner which is a challenge that most novels do not rise to.
B00000DHRX|3.0|Teen idol during the 80's , then gay icon during the 90's , all these years George Michael slowly builded an interesting if not fascinating music career . His best of complication is seperated in two parts , one &quot; for the heart&quot; and one &quot;for the feet&quot; . The &quot; for the feet &quot; part is certaintly more exciting . It includes some of the most well-made pop hits of the last decade such as &quot; Faith &quot; , &quot; Too Funky &quot; and &quot; Killer/Papa was a rolling stone &quot; . The highlight of this cd though is ofcourse &quot; Freedom '90 &quot; , a song which besides it's groovy character also stands out for it's guts and honesty in the lyrics. Tired of his carefree pop image , Michael confesses about the Wham period that  &quot; we had every big shot goodtime band on the run boy / we were living in a fantasy / we won the race / got out of the place / i went back home got a brand new face for the boys on Mtv... &quot;  yet  &quot;today the way i play the game has got to change , oh yeah / now i'm gonna get myself happy &quot;  . The &quot;for the heart&quot; part's strongest moments are &quot; Father Figure &quot; , &quot;Praying For time &quot; and &quot; Careless Whisper &quot; , one of the most romantic love songs of the recent music history . When you listen to those tracks you feel you have to take your hat off to Michael's writting talent . The weakest songs of &quot; Ladies And Gentlemen &quot; are his most recent ones . With the exception of  the elegant &quot; Fastlove &quot; , &quot; Spinning The wheel&quot; and &quot; Desafinado &quot; all the rest are too polished and not so substancial to be considered best of . &quot; Jesus to a child &quot; is too mellow while &quot; Outside &quot; could have been really better if it wasn't for those ludicrous &quot;...i think i'm done with the sofa &quot; lines . Even so , this collection along with Wham's best of release  prooves that Michael had been a gifted singer and songwritter all along.

So much energy flows from Christine - Mick - John - Lindsey and Stevie that it is very hard to sit still and watch this video! It was as if the healing was completed as a whole as soon as they hit the stage.   i would strongly recommend this video to all FM fans!    ~Legends - Poets - Priests of Nothing~ So VERY TIMELESS!
B000002AS3|4.0|Debut albums are always the best ones . Most bands tend to put all of their passion and love for music in their first work . Maybe it's because they are not yet known so they don't know what to excpect from the  future . Oasis are a living example of the above. Their first offering , seven years after it's release still sounds extremelly fresh and powerfull . That's not to say that today they aren't a talented gang  but they seem more interested in gaining  back their old status and glamour than to express themselfs artistically . Definetely Maybe was a truly stunning rock record . It had guts in the lyrics , personallity in the sound and a tricky but fascinating voice , really different from everything else we heard before. &quot; Live Forever &quot; is one of these rare , uplifting songs that rock bands have a hard time releasing today . Same goes for &quot; Supersonic &quot; where Liam provides vibrations of confidence to all of his listeners by simply being a bud who &quot;...needs to be himself &quot; . My favourite track though is &quot; Married with children &quot; . It includes some deliciously cynical lyrics singed with a cool style which makes you wish you could be as direct with people in your real life as well . Even if Oasis never get to be at the top of the charts again I'm glad they had the chance to be famous around the world , even for a while . Otherwise how would i have discovered this great album ?
B000002NC4|5.0|Doug Martch writes songs within songs, movements of music that bring the listener into a vast soundscape of swirling, chiming guitars, syncopated rythems, and imaginitive lyrics.  The core of Built to Spill, a revolving lineup of sorts, has really solidified on PFNO, adding a substantive underpinning that makes them more cohesive than ever.  Although Martch's lyrics gets occassionally a bit angsty, it is balanced with his pondorous moments, such as on Randy Described Eternity, where he hypothesizes on forever.<br />With just 8 tracks on the disc, you'd think there was no depth to PFNO, but after each listening, I hear new things.  So several years and thousands of listenings later, this album still rules, and easily makes my top 10 of the 90s, and probably top 10 all time.
0375500901|4.0|A former Israeli black ops intelligence agent comes out of retirement to track down his nemesis, a Palestinian extremist who is willing to kill, and die for, the complete restoration of a self-governing Palestine.  Gabriel Allen left the Israeli intelligence agency after a botched operation shredded his family and his life.  Since leaving the agency, Gabriel has been looking for solace in the art of restoring old great oil paintings for a London art dealer.  However, the risk of terrorism against a possible PLO/Israeli peace accord brings Gabriel back to make everything right for the world, and for his soul.     <br />The hunt is on to find Yusel al-Tawfiki, a former PLO terrorist who now believes Yasser Arafat has gone soft on too many issues.  Yusel, ironically, hates Arafat and Israeli, and if that were not enough loathing, he also has a personal vengeance against the Israeli agent, Gabriel Allen, who has been sent to destroy Yusel.  <br />The storyline runs deep with its ever unfolding sub-text.  And the characters, good and evil, have rich and compelling backgrounds with credible life circumstances.  We see the dark politics that drives both nations and individuals who are willing to kill for family, country and religion.  And we understand why.  This is an art of fiction that brushes realism into each page to produce a top-notch espionage thriller.

B00004U8JU|4.0|One of the best films of 1993 and based on the best-seller by Michael C., Jurassic Park tells the story of a multi-millionaire who tries to create the ultimate theme park: man and dinosaur get to meet for the first time in person due to advances in fossilized DNA. John Hammond, the owner of Jurassic Park, gets a group of scientific experts, including Dr. Alan Grant, a professional expert on dinosaurs, particularly deadly T-Rexes and cunning Velociraptors to explore and approve the island. A greedy businessman shuts down the park's security leading to attacks by meat eating dinosaurs. It's up to Alan Grant and his companions to try to survive in a world filled with dangerous beasts that were extinct for 65 million years. <br />Jurassic Park is a pretty good movie. The visual effects such as the giant Brachiosaurus encounter to the Galliminus chase scene are spectacular. The attack scenes such as the breakout of the T-Rex and the Raptor attack in the visitor's center will keep your mind in suspense and maybe even fear. Jurassic Park is one of the best movies of the 1990s. Don't miss the opportunity to have the experience of the dinosaur encounter.

B0000013GT|5.0|This is one of my favorite Outkast CDs. But the fan base in ATL wasn't going for Alein bit after these same two kats released the smash debut &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; for all the &quot;pimps&quot; and &quot;gangsters&quot; in ATL to go nuts over. I assume they wasn't feeling it because the CD really didn't hit big until the smooth pimped-out track &quot;Jazzy Bell&quot; hit radio and all headz were praising Outkast. <br />MAKE NO MISTAKES ABOUT ABOUT IT..........THIS IS A CLASSIC PURCHASE<br />oNe
6305350205|4.0|I definitely have to fall in 'the other camp' on this film, the one that actually likes (not loves) the film and isn't afraid to actually think for myself.  Yes there are weaknesses to the film and most have been covered: the forced humor, esp the scenes with Scotty, Uhura dancing (arrgh where's a stunt double when you need one) and an ending that would have to be a let down baded on the subject (trying to find God). There is however, a lot to like in this movie.  For the most part it revolves around Kirk, McCoy, and Spock's relationship with each other and does a find job of testing their limits with each other.  The whole segment from when Spock first confronts Sybok to the scene where he lets Sybock know that he has grown and accepted himself is the best reason to watch the film.  Plus the line, &quot;What does God need with a Starship&quot;, is classic trek (in both the good and bad sense).<br />As for all the one star flame throwing critics let me say this - Get a Life.  Watch every, and I mean every Star Trek movie and you can find plot holes to drive a truck through, so don't tell me that its any different in The Final Frontier.  A perfect example is in the best Trek movie Wrath of Kahn, and IT IS A BIG HOLE - why didn't Spock just put on one of those fancy new engineering suits when he was saving the ship and then he wouldn't have gotten radiation poisoning and die.  How is that plot hole any smaller than the one's in this movie.  Let alone all the holes in The Undiscovered Country, Generations, Insurrection, etc.<br />2.  To all those complaining about continuity and how long it takes to reach the great barrier - why don't you actually watch the movie, the Enterprise was going to the center of the galaxy not the edge.  (True it is a bit of a stretch how fast they got there but that's ALWAYS the case in Star Trek and pretty much every sci-fi movie.)  Lets compare it to say the amount of time it takes Spock to become perfectly on the planet Genesis (but thenShatner didn't direct that one.)<br />3.   Just because Shatner directed it doesn't mean you gotta hate it.  And in fairness to Shatner there were a lot of people involved who were hoping he would fail so it isn't like he got a lot of support. <br />4.   As to those who say the movie is unoriginal but the music by Jerry Goldsmith is great, then please go back and listen to the music from the first movie.  Goldsmith totally ripped himself off in this movie from the main title to the klingon themes.<br />I usually write short reviews but The Final Frontier could use a little defending.  Yes it wasn't a great movie (3 1/2 stars) but neither was Star Trek I, III, Generations, or Insurrection, but for some reason people get way too vitriolic over this movie.  Pop it in, sit back and imagine you are watching a 2 hr tv episode and enjoy it and realize you could be stuck watching a 2hr episode of Star Trek Voyager (yawwwwwnnnn.)

B00005BJPO|5.0|The first time I saw Akira I was 15 and I couldn't understand how deep this animation is. Second time was a revelation, this animation is powerful, sensitive &amp; full of philosophy...(deeper than any movie I ever saw) It will turns you out every time you will watch it. If you had one dvd to buy this year, I will defenetly recomend this one!
B00003CXSP|5.0|This movie was soo cool, hannibal is te most creative serial killer in the movies. He is pure evil. I hate the new Ms. Starling though. But all the same well done.
B000056K04|1.0|As a bass player for over 20 years i was really happy when steffan and carter were in the music world! But this last cd was awfull! Did carter or the rest of the band play on this?Common steffan please god dont change your style i love it so much! I mean 41 was a awsome song the structer was so great! Please dont do this to the other fans like myself that respect you as musicians! If you put out cds like this one you might as well be greenday or another pop band! Dont let your skills go to waist! And i thought the lillywhite cd was so much better!
B00005LMBK|5.0|This album combines bluesy rythms with old school hip hop...  I've heard several of the tracks and they are all amazing.  I highly suggest you check this album out if you like trip/abstract hip hop.  It's good stuff  :)
B000002URV|5.0|I want to begin with the fact that I love the name Enigma. Ever since Jean Luc Pontys early 70's album Enigmatic oceans, where I had to open the dictionary to learn the meaning of the word, have I loved the word. It almost describes the feelings and moods the music is about to set. From the start, I noticed the sounds created and used in the songs. They were fresh, new, mystical, and put to right on beats and tied together with some more familiar sounds of piano, strings, percussion, and some ancient sounds of Chants. The mix totally worked for me and was an inspiration.  Some of the french words after being transalted by a friend of mine, were a bit racey-to my suprise-but being that it was in french, those frenchies can get away with alot more than we can in the USA..Viva La Amore. Loved the CD and look forward to some more good sounds.
0385334206|5.0|If you are a Vonnegut fan than this book is a must read.  His quirky humor and abstract delve into the idiosyncracies of our human existence are not only hysterical, but will make you put down the book, think, and re-read sections to truly grasp the absurdity of our existance and question the monotony of our everyday lives.<br />If you enjoyed this also read Slaughterhouse Five!
B00003CX5P|5.0|First of all, if you go into this movie expecting it to change the world like the original Star Wars, you will bee disappointed.  It is absolutely impossible for history to repeat itself in that sense because 1) Star Wars had the very important element of surprise in 1977 and 2) movies like this just weren't being made back then.   With Episode 1, George Lucas took on the almost impossible task of adding to an American icon.  One magazine article published before the May 1999 premiere (I don't remember which magazine) said it was comparable to redesigning the American flag or giving Mickey Mouse a brother.  Keeping this in mind, Episode 1 holds up extremely well.  It maintains the Star Wars 'feel' throughout, and the podrace and final battle sequences had my pulse racing.     The main area of criticism is the younger appeal this film seems to have when compared to the original trilogy.  This is nonsense to me, the Star Wars saga has always been for kids and like all good childrens' movies it offers a much needed break for adults tired of all the cinicism, and meaningless violence in films today.   Of course, the other sore spot for many people is Jar Jar Binks.  Honestly, I liked him.  He offered a refreshing contrast to the stoic, respectful Jedi.  I can understand why some people can't abide his silliness, but that all comes down to opinions, and you know what they say about those.     When all is said and done, Episode 1 is a worthy movie and a good starting point for the Star Wars saga.  However, don't forget, it's only a movie; lighten up and enjoy it.
006092988X|5.0|This book is impossible not to love. It is one of my top 5 favorite books. The characters and the story touch your heart and change the way you look at life. I highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of your taste in books.
0380973650|5.0|American Gods is a brilliantly crafted story - elegantly told, easy to read and impossible to put down. Neil Gaiman understands the human condition better than most and he writes about it with brutal honesty, loving compassion and a great sense of humour.<br />With this big, fat novel Mr. Gaiman has outdone himself. It is a masterpiece and his finest work to date; stories within stories, ancient mythologies and dark mysteries told in such a way as to touch your heart and your soul and change the way you see the world forever.<br />This story goes beyond the boundaries of fantasy, horror, thriller and road-trip genres to a magical realism where the fantastic is so seamlessly woven into the familiar world that you'll not even notice that you've suspended your disbelief and it's dangling in mid air without a safety net.<br />Overall, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Mr. Gaiman has created a truly modern classic of a kind that will enjoy a vast audience. Those who loved Sandman will love this and those who loved Stardust and Neverwhere will be blown away. And if you've not sampled his work before - after this you will want more.
B000001Y42|5.0|The strong riffs, looping bass lines, and loud drumming, coupled with Lethal's streaming sound development was the perfect foil for Fred Durst to let loose on the world through his microphone. This album is very raw, and has a certain aggresive feel to it. How I wish Limp Bizkit had stayed this way. Ths stand out tracks to this album are Polloution, Counterfeit and Nobody Loves Me. If your a Linkin Park fan this album is probably not for you, Chocolate Starfish is probably the album for you. If your a fan of heavier side of Limp Bizkit, this album should be well suited to your tastes.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The wait is over.  I thought we would have to wait until Episode III was released to get all of these great films on DVD.  Even though Episode I is the only title being released, it's still better than none at all.  Bravo to George Lucas.  The Star Wars release party is already in early planning.
0789723107|5.0|A great intro to the subject of design usability. It was a quick and enjoyable read. <br />I'm pretty much a one-man-show at work when it comes to the technical and design aspects of our website. Unfortunately I've had very little influence on layout and usability issues. In the past few meetings I've begun quoting sections and sighting examples from this book; consequently favor has swung my way and the sight has begun to change - finally for the better.<br />One of my co-workers - a database coder -  borrowed the book for two days and decided to buy a copy for himself. Even after reading it he sees it as a great resource to return to time-and-again.
0792833279|5.0|If the Pulp Fiction was too violent for your sophisticated tastes and you still love gangster movies, just go for this one and you will not be disappointed.  This movie is another hit in the come-back run of Mr. Travolta, who gives in there one of his very best performances. Danny De Vito as Mr. Martin Weir just shines into the outer space and I guess I do not have to mention the acting qualities of His Highness Mr. Gene Hackman. <br />...and two straws for Harry here...<br />The movie is full of great lines and all characters form together a constellation of fun loving &quot;more-or-less criminals and crooks&quot;. <br />Plot is really a masterpiece (thanks to exquisite writing of Mr. Elmore Leonard) and as the movie goes to its end, stay focused to truly enjoy the final arch of its baroque construction.<br />Editing was done perfectly and the film has a tempo which is as stylisch as the clothes of Mr. Palmer.<br />Please, notice also the great music which gently underlines the tone and pace of the movie language. The opening credits music is one of the best and it may be compared with the Pulp Fiction opening credits music in its &quot;get ready for a ride, dear viewer&quot; atmosphere. <br />Generally, this movie has no weaknesses and it is a gem in my collection. I saw it like 15 times and I will give it a lot more play as the life will go on.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I tried sending a review for this yesterday, but my internet connection got ..., so hopefully this isn't redundant:<br />Gorillaz is the Monkees taken to the next level.  Instead of creating a fake band out of four unknowns without any musical talent, the record company has brought together four people of great talent with diverse musical backgrounds and fused them into something unique.  Hiding behind the names of four cartoon characters whose histories, designed with the help of Jamie Hewlett of \\"Tank Girl\\" fame, can be found on their website and elsewhere, are such people as Blur's Damon Alburn.  This cartoon character gimmick is not unique and is no substitute for good music..., but in this case you do get great music,  and it is fun to explore the various websites and learn about the characters.<br />Personally, Alburn is the only member I was already familiar with, and his distinctive vocals, which often sound like he MAY be happy or MAY just be sarcastic (especially on \\"Clint Eastwood\\"), dominate many of the songs.  As a result, comparisons to Blur are unavoidable.  For example, the song \\"Punk Rock\\" is like a toned down \\"B.L.U.R.E.M.I.\\", and the eclecticism of this album is reminiscent of Blur's 13.  However, the other members have made obviously important contributions to the album as well given how successful this album is at being funky in contrast to Blur's pathetic \\"Trailerpark\\".<br />The music itself is a unique blend of hip hop, trip hop (with bass drones straight out of Massive Attack), the blues (especially in songs like \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\" with its strong use of harmonica), and British guitar pop (Blur), and it amazingly manages to work quite well.  With any lesser talent, this album would be a complete mess.  However, it all manages to somehow work, creating a unique hybrid of music that should appeal to people of diverse tastes.  For example, although I normally dislike hip hop, I find myself enjoying it as part of the mix on this album.  <br />Because of the album's eclecticism, no one song really stands out as the best, and everyone will probably have their own favourites as well as one or two songs they dislike (I personally hate the minimalist dub of \\"Double Bass\\").  But does the novelty of this new sound wear off? No.  I have also been listening to this album for a month (it was released earlier ...) and I haven't grown tired of it.  This album is destined to be a classic.  However, I would still recommend that people try to listen to some of it before buying.  It does take some getting used to and won't be for everyone.<br />With its funky beats the music, even when it is being melancholy instead of bright and cheerful, is great for partying, but at the same time it works well for just laying back and relaxing.  It is extremely versatile.
0060278234|5.0|I tell you youngsters that this books kicks Harry potter into the dirt.  Garth Nix writes a great series about Sabriel and later about Lirael.  I love it!!  I assure you that if you buy this book, you'll get a better plot and story than the stupid Harry Potter series!
B00005B7CK|5.0|I saw it at Tinker Street Cinema in beautiful Woodstock, NY, in early Summer so the setting was just right and may have influenced my opinion... But I loved this movie so much! It's absolutely hilarious from the very first scene to the last. The characters are unique and memorable, the story moves at a great pace... I can't imagine anyone not having a good time watching this movie. Not at all what I expected. Don't miss it!
B000056V73|2.0|I had heard how great this movie was, but was sorely disappointed. I think a great movie could be made about the rock scene in the 60s and 70s, but this isn't it. I found the characters too stereotypical and the situations absurd. Surely, we weren't that shallow and silly at that time.
B000031XCR|4.0|This is a Greatest Hits collection with a bonus. No fewer than 7 newly recorded songs which help to take off the monotony of an album whose songs have been so overplayed on the radio, that people actually get sick of them. I do enjoy Celine's music, but I have to admit that sometimes her &quot;screaming&quot; does annoy me. She has an absolutely beautiful voice and it would be lovely to hear her sing without the &quot;power&quot; sometimes. She also sings a 'duet' here with the late Frank Sinatra. The results are pretty good, and I'm sure that Frank wouldn't mind at all, and would probably love it. But a lot of Franks fans will not approve. The 16 page booklet contains photos and the lyrics for the 7 new songs.
B00003CXN4|4.0|Soderbergh has brilliantly intertwined three stories with extraordinary cinematography.  While the film's direction is reminiscent of Natural Born Killers, the story lines themselves delve deep into the minds of the characters as they battle their own wars of good vs. evil.  Complete with bevy of Hollywood legends as well was some brilliant newcomers; Traffic will keep you guessing what their next move will be.  While the movie is a tad long at 2 ½ hours, you won't be disappointed by the non-stop action of the powerful drug trade between the US and Mexico.  The only disappointment was the lack of extras on the DVD.  With only with some trailers and a brief glimpse behind-the-scenes, you find yourself clicking the \\"menu\\" button looking for more.
B0000026WD|3.0|Full of synth heavy, electronic beats, rap, and repetitive lyrics throughout, this is not one of Jackson's finest albums, although it is certainly danceable. Some of the lyrics seem to be almost autobiographical and an attempt to explain himself to people, as in &quot;Why you wanna trip on me&quot; and &quot;Black or white&quot;. There are certainly catchable hooks in this album, but all are electronically generated and just repeat over and over again. The 24 page booklet contains all lyrics (you will see how very repetitive they are, and not at all intelligent). But if you are a big Jackson fan, then I suppose you should own this album as well.
B000002P72|5.0|An old friend of mine introduced me to the blues years ago by playing this album. Several years and several attempts to find better blues later, this is still at the top of my list.<br />B.B. always has had a wonderful rapport with the crowd, and it's something you won't hear on a studio recording. Between songs, he'll give a bit of backgroud of the song, or he'll just say &quot;Now we're going way down in the alley.&quot; His backing band, Lucielle (his guitar) and his beautiful baritone voice are a perfect blend here - nothing overpowers the rest.<br />Another thing I've always liked about B.B. - he's about the happiest blues player I've ever seen. He really loves his work, and he's darn good at what he does. The crowd really feeds into his emotions, giving a great response at times, like when he wails &quot;I gave you seven children, and now you want to give 'em back&quot; during HOW BLUE CAN YOU GET.<br />This album is short, but very sweet. There's always time for the blues, especially when it's B.B. behind the mic. Eric Clapton can't measure up - he was lucky to get a chance to share an album with B.B.

6305594252|3.0|with a creative science fiction story behind it, Stargate is definitely worth a viewing.  Emmerich couples outstanding visual effects with tremendous audio and some interesting special features on the DVD.<br />In the cast, both Spader and Jaye Davidson contribute strong performances.  Spader is the everyman who is a specialist in some sort of obscure intelligentsia who gets confronted with action and involved with people when his science comes alive.  He makes the right choices and has both the audience and the rest of the cast rooting for him as he stumbles into his eventual success.  An interesting actor who can play a naive hero or a driven villain, Spader leads the way in this film.  Jaye Davidson is chilling as the villain.  Without words, his presence on screen can make you feel his lack of remorse and his willingness to do away with everything that comes between him and his final destiny.<br />Soldiers in the cast include the oft-cast Russell as the commander of the mission, in, what is typical for him, a &quot;strong jaw&quot; role.<br />Critics have challenged this movie as absurd and cliche, but after all, what is science fiction trying to accomplish?  Stargate had success at the box office and on video precisely because of its entertainment value and the visual excitement generated by combining technology with a society that rivals the ancient Egyptians.  Although you may rent instead of buy, you will enjoy this entertaining film, and may return to it again and again because it draws you in and keeps you entertained until the very last (and yes, it is a heart-warming finale!)<br />Try it, you'll like it!
630218021X|1.0|Whoops!<br />So sorry - I meant to call this movie a &quot;large, calorie filled English TRIFLE&quot; - there's obviously no such thing as an English Triple [unless it's &quot;Sunday, Bloody Sunday&quot;].<br />also<br />&quot;Glenda Jackson is one of the most gifted acresses of the 20th Century - no one has [not had] ever reached her zenith&quot;  Apology to Ms. Jackson - she's still # 1.<br />blame it on the tri-focals.<br />Sorry again.

0553573403|1.0|I have to say that when people recommended this book to me, I expected another fantasy epic.  I was sorely disapointed.  This author seems to enjoy nothing more than torturing his characters, beyond the point where we would see their suffering end, even in real life.  None of them have hope for a happy future, nor does any character have the least shred of dignity or honor.  I have to say that if I lived in the world of the Starks and the Lannisters, I probably would have killed myself long ago.<br />Why does anyone want to read a fantasy epic where nothing good ever happens?
B00005BJC7|5.0|After reading practically all the reviews for Amnesiac, it suddenly became crystal clear: they're all intelligent-sounding, some are quite poetic. And while it may seem &quot;snotty&quot; to some, it stands-in its own odd way-as an image of the fans of Radiohead. They're smart;they see through the clogged veins of mainstream American music(an endless loop,no?)and are able to appreciate, sometimes even glorify, RH's music for what it is, or-more importantly-what it's not. This &quot;new&quot; album is terrifyingly good, melodic enough to accompany any manic-depressive's(?) life. On Amnesiac's &quot;jazzy&quot; final note-the unnerving yet calming &quot;Life In A Glasshouse&quot;-Mr. Yorke cries,&quot;Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat...&quot; After a few listens I heard-&quot;Well of course we'd like to annihilate Britney, maybe even strangle Limp Bizket...&quot;  Hey-artistically speaking-they have, haven't they?
B000001DQG|4.0|...this CD is good compared to Blue Moves and the trash that followed it for years! OK Its not Elton's best, but it was from his best era, and it contains possibly his best ballad ever: \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\". A couple of [not so good] songs and the rest are good. Try listening to Blue Moves all the way through and then talk to me about quality! Maybe I'm biased since I saw Elton live when this album was new.
0446677450|3.0|Clearly, Robert Kiyosaki has struck a goldmine with his \\"Rich Dad\\" series of personal finance books. Millions buy them in the hope that they will learn something useful about acquiring (sp)wealth. To that end, I think that \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" is only partly successful. <br />Kiyosaki begins with the assumption that most people are financially ignorant. Therefore, the vast majority of the population produce children without the financial know-how to succeed in life. On this point the author is dead-on. In my family, money was simply not talked about. In the families of my Israeli friends, however, money and business are the primary topics of discussion at the dinner table and just about everywhere else. And these Israeli friends of mine are all well-off, owning businesses and real estate--none of them came to the U.S. with a nickel in their pockets. So, yes, it's true, all of us need to develop a certain mindset about money and success in order to make it to the top financially. Moreover, we need to do more to teach our children these principles as well. <br />Where Kiyosaki falters in not in the \\"what\\" but in the \\"how\\". All through the book he is \\"begging the question\\". His reasoning goes something like this:<br />     If you want to be rich, start your own company, buy and sell real estate, and invest in good stocks.    <br />This is akin to telling someone that if they want to be a world-class athelete to \\"win the olympics, the heavyweight belt, and the world series.\\" That's great, but how? And you will be asking the same questions as you read \\"Rich Dad\\". <br />I can personally realate to much of the philosophy in \\"Rich Dad\\" as I was a high-school drop-out with a disdain for working for someone else. I started my own company at 24 and am still making my own living at 30. Far from rich, I would work for myself for minimum wage before working for someone else for $50,000 a year. The point of my relating all of this is that I agree with Kiyosaki's main thesis: most people have what I call a \\"job mentality\\" and need to snap out of it if they are ever to be successful. J. Paul Getty said that the only way for a young man to be rich was in a business of his own. He was right. <br />Overall, Kiyosaki is a relatively poor author--thus the three stars. He meanders and belabors his main points to absurdity. It's hard to beleive some of the stories in the book. I am quite sure that the majority of them are fanciful embellishments. He points this out himself when he says, \\"I am not the best-writing author, but the bestselling author.\\" Or something to that effect. Hey, at least he's honest and he's making a lot of money. Good for him. <br />But he doesn't need your help so save your money for another book. I recommend \\"The Richest Man in Babylon.\\" Much more readable, fun, and is considered a classic decades after it was written...
B000003C4M|5.0|Welcome to hell is the best of the original trilogy by venom.  Anyone with an interest in death metal, black metal or even just plain old rock and roll should buy this classic 1980 release - as with &quot;at war with satan,&quot; the artwork should be redone by whoever distributes it to more closely match the original.

B00004T8RK|5.0|After the experimental No Code and the middling Yield, Pearl Jam roars back with their best album since 1994's Vitalogy.  Binaural is lean and mean and finds the band ripping through the fourteen songs with focused intensity.  Former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron joins the band and his steady beats provide a sturdy backbone to the album.  Eddie Vedder sounds great especially on songs like the melancholy &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot;, the manic &quot;Breakerfall&quot; and the powerful &quot;Light Years&quot;.  Bassist Jeff Ahmet melds nicely with Mr. Cameron to create a solid rhythm section and provides some of the best lyrics that he has ever written.  Guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready trade licks and some explosive, machine gun riffs.  Binaural isn't up to the level of the band's classic first three albums, but it is still a great rock record.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal is a visual muppet masterpiece.  Taking three years to make and going way over budget, the Dark Crystal hit theaters with mixed reviews.  As time moved on The Dark Crystal became a cult sleeper and is now loved by many people.  The story is the classic mythological journey story of growth and healing.  A gelfling, Jen, is one of the last of his kind to go out into the land of the dark crystal to find the shard that will heal the power source that tore its planet apart. Besides healing the crystal, Jen learns much about who he really is and the kind of people the gelfings use to be. The cruel Skeksis and gentle Mystics are beautifully crafted each in their own image to match their personality.  The pod people are an uplifting event admist the stress that is placed upon the main character.  The beauty of the planet, the wonder of the characters, and the story itself will take a person away for close to an hour and a half.<br />Aside from the movie, this DVD is special because it offers a completely instrumental track by composer Trevor Jones.  Since the soundtrack is no longer readily available, this little instrumental addition to the DVD allows the listener to feel the wonder of the film through the music alone.  Along with the documentary and deleted scenes, this DVD is worth every penny.  Jim Henson's crew spared no expense for the viewer to take the fantasy home.
0393317552|5.0|Concerning global power imbalances, the best book on this subject I have ever read, by a million country miles, is \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" by Jared Diamond.    It's amazing, original, thoroughly researched and logically presented.    The basic conclusion is that while there is genetic variation amongst the human population (which is obvious), and while this means that certain sub-groups are better or worse in certain characteristics than others - this is all insignificant when it comes to equality.    The most significant idea presented is that regardless of which group of humans you choose to study, you'll find that they will exploit their immediate environment by the maximum amount possible.    So the power imbalances that exist today are entirely the result of unequal resource distribution throughout history, and not unequal human beings.    It's quite profound, when you think about it.

B000059TEP|5.0|I first viewed this film about 10 years ago when it first came out.  Loved it then and love it even more now.  This is darn near a perfect film for me as it contains drama, action, love, humor, and a great soundtrack to boot, all in one film!  I couldn't believe the feelings I had as I was watching this film recently.  If you haven't seen this, rent it immediately as I guarantee it will be the best 127 minutes spent in front of a TV as you can imagine.
B000059TPN|5.0|this movie's got everything, action-packed,thrilled,great actors, witted as well. better than the word &quot;masterpeice&quot;. if you didn't watch this film, (i can't believe there's someone didn't watch this great stuff) you simply have to buy or rent it. it's gonna blow you up there.
B0000041Z5|5.0|This set is the perfect Brahms symphony set.  I can say little more.  The tempos are wonderful, especially in the second (which I believe is the best recorded symphony in the set).  The fourth is amazing; the first is strong and powerful.  The third is great, however, in the first movement, I believe the trombones should have been louder.  However, all together, this set is a steal for (the price).  Buy it and you will not be disappointed.
071198042X|5.0|I truely enjoyed reading this book.  I have, for many years been a Freddie Mercury fan and great admirer of his music. I was very apprehensive about buying this book, as most often books as such are rarely kind to the individual whom they are written about.  But I felt that this book characterized Freddie Mercury more as a &quot;person&quot; rather than this huge &quot;rock star&quot; (which he was) and gave some delightful and colorfull insight into his daily life. The book is filled with many stories and incidents that depict his life style more in terms of his love of music, the band, his friends, his home and his cats.  There are stories demonstrating his sensitive character, as well as his over all kindness and generousity.  The fact that he was gay is secondary in this book, but it was not ignored either. If you are a Freddie Mercury fan I know you will enjoy this book very much.  The photo section in the book is good...but for Freddie Mercury fans there are never enough pictures.<br />I myself have reread my book several times and enjoy it just as much each time, sometimes reading something I missed before.   Peter Freestone remembered his friend kindly.
B0000041WV|5.0|Kertesz was the greatest conductor of Dvorak's works.  Each symphony is filled with great emotion and pathos and excitement.  Kertesz was able to achive this spontanious sound in several ways.  First of all, he never over-rehearsed the orchestra, keeping the sound young and fresh.  Secondly, he would come to rehearsals with the score completely memorised.  And finally, he recorded the set with the London Symphony, an orchestra which did not know Dvorak's music well.  These three elements contribute to th rustic beauty found in every one of the symphonies.  The orchestra is also top notch.  The brass, especially the trombones, are powerful and strong, adding great color.  The woodwind players play their parts with such sublime grace that it is hard to imagine they were not familiar with the music.  And even though this set was recorded almost 50 years ago, the &quot;London&quot; sound is clear and powerful - it almost sounds as if it was recorded yesterday. Kertesz does many great things with the orchestra that seem so clear, but very few other conductors have done the same.  Dynamicly, Kertesz is a master.  The orchestra can grow from pp to ff in seconds, creating huge sweeping waves of rich sound.  As I said before, the brass is strong, as it should be in any work by Dvorak.  And the strings have a full, but rustic sound to them, reminding us that Dvorak was originally a small town musican.  Futhermore, because his music is so deeply rooted in the folk music tradition, it seems necessary to keep the orchestra sounding fresh and rustic. This is the perfect set, and for the price, I would buy it now before it goes out of print!  -- Also, Kertesz's cycle of the Schubert symphonies with London are also perfect readings. --

0805066691|4.0|Anyone interested in history should read this book. It is full of extremely poignant stories, each of which would make for a great film or TV mini-series.  While it sometimes degnerates into polemic, the facts speak so loudly for themselves that they cannot be ignored.<br />I gave this book as a gift to my wife when she was about to emigrate to the US, more than ten years ago.  She gobbled it up and we still discuss it.<br />When I read this book, I wanted to learn more, perhaps read an entire history, about every story or chapter.  THere are fascinating characters that crop up, only to abruptly disappear, and many threads left uncovered.  This is not a criticism, as it is a survey, but it was frustrating.<br />You will not forget this book.  Get it.
B00000JSJC|5.0|this dvd is amazing on dvd. Make sure you have surround sound. The first 2 minutes of the mive will proove to you it was worth gettting extras speakers. Not to gove away the scene but the story begins through the eyes of a robber and you can hear him breathing heavy in the back speakers. Really cool. This movie was a big hit in the theaters, and kind of dissapeared afterwards. It's got a great story which takes place in a span of two days including the turn of the century. This movie was prior to the turn of the century, so it's cool from that standpoint. The dvd extras are worth it though. There are a few deleted scenes that was cool sthey showed but you understand why they got cut. Also it has 2 trailers. This one is worth your money and sound system.
0441008356|5.0|Revelation Space is a fantastic first novel - its hard-edged sci-fi with great characters, we get the vastness of space, inner and outer. Alastair Reynolds is a brilliant writer. I found it gripping, very clever, with wonderful descriptions that create a strong visual dimension as you read. This authors imagination really stretches you, and what a story teller. I would rate him with Vernor Vinge and thats something in my book. I'm avidly waiting for the next one, I want more!
0805062971|4.0|Fight club is a gritty, in-your-face satire of the modern television-raised generation's quest for material goods.  If you've seen the movie first it will most-certainly clear up many an ambiguous detail you might have left you scratching your movie-going head at after seeing it.  Whether you love this book or it enrages you to the point of taking your personal pet, placing it in the microwave and turning the power to full for 20 minutes, it is extremely well-written and funny.  If you've ever wanted to know how to make napalm, break cylinder locks, create your own soap, or make cool scars in your hand, blow somebody to smitherines when they turn on their computer, this book is for you.  Or if you're just looking for good reading it's also for you.  It is not for you, however if you are looking for something to inspire you to buy a table in the shape of a yin and yan that can connect together.
0553328255|5.0|It's amazing how many other books and films and stage performances are made about sherlock holmes, even today. one only needs to turn to these originals to understand the immense popularity of these victorian stories. most importantly, it is the characters who stand out and above. sherlock holmes and dr. john h. watson. what more can be said of them? they are simply the best! they are so real and consistant in character i can't believe they're fictional most of the time.i esp. admire that one and only sherlock holmes, justly described by his friend as &quot;the best and the wisest man... ever knew&quot;. may the spirit of the Canon live on!
B000006T0D|2.0|I am surprised to see so many reviewers lauding this album, because for me, it is a complete failure and doesn't come even close to the classics Parallel Lines or Plastic Letters. The problem lies in the songs: Atomic was obviously an attempt to recreate Heart Of Glass, but ultimately it goes nowhere and only has novelty value, at best. Union City Blue is an attempt at a soulful ballad, but also fails miserably. Dreaming is sort of acceptable, but lacks bite. I'm really sorry, but this album is a hopeless mess. It lacks cutting-edge songs with immediate hooks and personality. As such it is a quite forgettable album and didn't provide Blondie with any great hits. Rather stick to the above-mentioned classics or get one of their Best Of or Greatest Hits collections.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Star Wars I was a fairly average movie, it provided me with several hours of good entertainment and I've got no compliants, but it definitely isn't a great follow up to the classics of Star Wars 4-6.

B000001U3K|4.0|This is a funky laid-back album that never lived up to the potential it's hit single, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; suggests. The other songs are folkie rockers and Harry Nielson-like sleepers that never get very wild. Still, if Lou Reed wants to dig a ditch and wallow in it, I'll listen.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This CD is great! It's pretty much Kid A but with more guitar.  Also, like Kid A, it has more of a variety in the music.  Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box is a great song.  Radiohead did an excellent job of combining the various sounds together to create the song.  Pyramid song to me is ok.  It's not the best, but it shows the variety of the music in the CD.  Who knows maybe you'll like it.  Pulk/pull revolving doors is another great song.  It's got a lot of electronica with a weird voice that sounds like Thom just inhaled heilium before he did this song.  You and whose army is another ok song.  It's sappy, but it is fun just listening to the lyrics.  I might be wrong is my favorite song.  It's got the classic guitar of Radiohead with the new electronica sounds they're making today.  Knives out is also a good song.  It's got that surf guitar to it that's makes it great.  Morning bell/amnesiac has the same lyrics as as the Kid A version but it has different music to it.  I can't tell if I like it or if I'm annoyed by it.  Dollars and cents is pretty good.  Most of the music is Thom's voice singing, with the guitar and drums giving the music a beat to it.  Hunting bears is good until after few seconds because you get bored of the same instrument that keeps playing.  Like spinning plates is another one of my favorites.  The lyrics and the music makes it seem dreamlike.  Life in a glass house is another ok one. The lyrics are fun to listen to though.  All in all, Amnesiac is a great piece of work.
0553106635|5.0|I have to admit when I joined the ranks of Martin's readers, I was dubios at best.  I was waiting for Goodkind and Jordan to come out with their next sequal, and I was in desperate need of a fantasy fix. I read the review on the first of Martin's books, and was seduced by the flattery of the reviewer, when it came to the qualities of fantasy readers. So I bought the first one, and took my time getting around to reading it. It was barely interesting enough at the begining to keep me turning the pages.  But, soon, the pace picked up, and it has only gotten better from there. A Storm of Swords is has a good pace, and interesting plot. You find yourself sympathizing with characters that you once thought that you once hated, and intended to let out a cheer when you read of thier demise.  Martin manages to do this, with grace and skill. Few writers can make you change your feelings for a character, without being heavy handed and obvious about it. But Martin simply lets you see a different side of Such Characters as Jaime, the Hound, and Littlefinger.  And if they are not quite the hero's of the story, they are, like all of Martins Characters, very human and real. The only complaint that I have about his books is that they just end. THere is not closure or real ending. It is simply ends. Leaving you hanging for the next one. But, like most fantasy saga readers, it is a feeling that I am now used to, if not happy with.
B00004Z459|1.0|For a time there, I loved them. Then I liked them. Then I sold the CD and was like \\"they're kind of good, but not for me\\". But now I hate them. This is not rock, nor rap. Where's the originality in today's music? Where are the guitar solos, or inventive lyrics? And why do they make awful videos? Crawling is like the worst song ever. Techno/rock/rap? God, no. It needs more substance, more thought, more energy. It comes off as boring and there are a million better bands. And when a genre-bending band like Lostprophets can efficiently make good music, why bother with Linkin Park? Please...stay away from this.

B00005LMBK|4.0|I bought this album thinking only one or two songs were going to good, Clint Eastwood was the main reason for my purchase. But after I listened to it I was amazed, this is some good stuff. I really like the instrumental tracks Sound Check and Double Bass! Its a truley different style and flavor of music which is cool, next to all the same BS that is out today. If you want to check out something totally different this could be the album for you. Trip Hop to the fullest.

0767903862|5.0|I admit it.  I am one of the many who ignores Australia.  Sure, they had the Olympics there, but I have never entertained the thought of visiting.  Until I read this book, that is.<br />In his inimatable enthusiasm and taste for the absurd, Bill Bryson has painted a vibrant, scratch-and-sniff descriptive portrait of the world's most neglected continent.  From the death stories of the rich and famous (in what other country could a Prime Minister take one step into a gorgeous sea and vanish entirely?) to the brush-of-death stories of the narrator (wild dogs, boogie boards, and so on), telling of Australia's amazing natural treasures, interesting inhabitants, and enough cold beer to drown in, Bryson has convinced me that a trip around the globe would be well worth it.  An absolutely riveting and hilarious read, even if you don't think you like Australians, travel, or even books.  BUY IT NOW!

B000002JSR|4.0|This post-Zeppelin album was released in '82, and features pure outakes from the Zeppelin era, especially from &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot;. Actually before this album was released, Pagey was thinking about releasing the &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot; outakes as an EP. <br />This album doesn't really contain a bad song (have yet to hear a bad zep tune, and i own all their albums). But doesn't contain any masterpieces er Zep classics. Although there are a few gems in this album, such as one of my favorites, &quot;Poor Tom&quot;. Other notables include: &quot;Wearing &amp; Tearing&quot;, &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot;, We're Gonna Groove&quot;, &quot;Walter's Walk&quot;, &quot;Darlene&quot;, &quot;Ozone Baby&quot; &amp; the instrumental &quot;Bonzo's Montreux&quot;.<br />It's pretty amazing if you think about it, ALL of these songs were not good enough to be released in any of their previous albums, yet they are better than most music from any other band! I'd like to hear of another band, other than the beatles, that could release a good album featuring nothing but outakes from previous albums. Only Zeppelin had the power &amp; talent to do so!
B00003CXMG|4.0|This movie, along with Dazed and Confused, is one of my favorite looks back at the seventies.  I was just starting to discover rock in the late seventies and aside from the actual LP's and AOR radio, Creem magazine was a guide and a bible.  I remember the dedication and memorial in Creem when Lester Bangs died.  It was great to see Philip Seymour Hoffman portraying the original &quot;gonzo rock journalist&quot; and getting to hear a sliver of Bangs's twisted, enthusiastic views on music and being a rock fan.  You can't hide the nerd music lover behind the facade of the cynical rock writer.  I also love his hatred of Rolling Stone, a magazine that regular readers of Creem always knew was a poser and pretender in the world of rock magazines.<br />The cast are superb.  The boy, Patrick Fugit, is charming and perfectly cast as a shy, naive fledgling reporter.  A lot has been written about Kate Hudson's performance and it's all true.  She convey's self-assuredness and insecurity at the same time.  Billy Crudup's character is likable, despite his bad behavior.  the supporting cast are all outstanding.<br />The movie, as Cameron Crowe points out in the featurette included on the DVD, is a love letter to seventies rock, the people who perform it and the fans that love it, as a result it's a lightweight film.  Despite the bad behavior of the band and the potential to show the dehumanizing treatment of groupies by misogynistic rock stars the movie glosses it all over and everyone acts with honor.  I don't mind though, there's always room for an up beat movie.  I really enjoyed this movie.  If you liked it I would suggest Dazed and Confused, and This Is Spinal Tap.

B000002C4J|5.0|LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE is Celine Dion's most recent full album with brand new songs. It's definitely her best (besides FALLING INTO YOU, ALL THE WAY...A DECADE OF SONG, and THE COLLECTOR'S SERIES). This album is very beautiful and outstanding with strong, solid lyrics and vocals. This album also features many other outstanding guest artists including the one-and-only Barbra Streisand and Luciano Pavarotti. My personal favorite tracks are: &quot;The Reason&quot;, &quot;Immortality&quot;, &quot;Treat Her Like A Lady&quot;, &quot;Tell Him&quot; (duet with Barbra Streisand), &quot;Just A Little Bit Of Love&quot;, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; (theme from TITANIC - of course!), &quot;To Love You More&quot;, and &quot;Let's Talk About Love&quot;, the title track, where she invites a young choir group to sing with her. There are some tracks which I could care less for, but all in all, this is a must have for any Celine Dion fan. It's beautiful and spirited. They're unforgettable songs and this album is sure-to-be a classic. Definitely a must buy for anyone with a heart and soul.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie was an extrodinary performance of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor although, I would have liked Satine to have lived, but on the other hand most Hollywod love stories have death intertwined in them some how. Baz Luhrman's writing of this film interested me greatly and I hope other people as well. On the Opera a few days after the premiere of the film Baz said he was looking for something with singing, dancing, truth, beauty, freedom, and love and from my point of view I waould say he captured all of the above.
6304981635|5.0|This movie is a classic of any genre.  It has such a great dated feel to it like other classic sixties and seventies films such as Goldfinger, Deliverance or Dirty Harry.  I love the cast and their interaction.  A Chinese, African American and white guy all fighting together like there's nothing out of the ordinary about it, which is how it should be.  These days you would have to have some joke where the Chinese guy makes some \\"innocent\\" crack about the 'hood or the black man calling the white guy cracker.  In this film everyone is treated with equal respect.  It seems to me this is something that was more common place in films in the early seventies or maybe it was the influence of Bruce Lee's own philosophies.  Whatever the cause, it's nice to see three different races represented as equals.<br />The plot is a cross between a James Bond movie and the standard Kung Fu pictures.  Bruce Lee is recruited by a shadowy government organization to infiltrate a mysterious island as a participant in a Karate tournament.  This is basically a character and action driven movie because there isn't much suspense.  It's pretty much a given that Han is up to something.<br />Where this movie shines is the martial arts action.  I originally saw Enter The Dragon as a double feature at the drive in in the early eighties.  I remember thinking as I watched the first feature (Kill Or Be Killed) that the fighters were fast.  That is until Bruce Lee came on.  I had never seen anyone move that fast before or since.  The final fight in the house of mirrors holds up well and is every bit as thrilling as any fight scene of today.<br />As for the bonus features, the trailers are interesting if for no other reason then it's amusing to see how far commercials have come.  The interview with Bruce Lee is particularly poignant.  It makes you wonder what would be next.  He had a powerful personality and very definate views on fame and movie making.  I think his films would have only gotten better and may have even brought equality and better roles for minorities to the movies decades sooner.d may have even brought equality and better roles for minorities to the movies decades sooner.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie was the best that I have every seen.  Everything about this movie is so true, like how the Dad wouldn't let teenage Daugthers date until they graduated from High school.  I know a lot of Parents like that.  Then how Patrick was paid to go out with a girl.  That happens a lot now a days but I wish that all guys would fall in love just like Patrick did.  To all of those how haven't seen this movie, go out and see it.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Those of you who don't appreciate the Wu's latest efforts, and there is alot of talk of a lack of hunger, fresh concepts, and RZA beats should check this classic out. GZA layers his verses with several meanings and the beats are razor-sharp. Rae and Ghost do one of their best efforts on  Investigative. The title song and Shadowboxing are also super highlights. This is hiphop for the intelligent brother.
B000007MVD|5.0|We brits have had the joy of listening to this superb double album for quite a while now. I can still remember the excitement of going onto the record shop and asking if they'd got the new beatles album.(and I'm 46!!) Although the recordings are not of the same quality as their studio albums, it really does give  you a flavour of what the unadorned fabs must have sounded like live, under the screams and mass hysteria. Those radio shows were a real life line to pop starved souls in the 60's.<br />Before I drown in my own wave of nostalgia, I'd just say, buy it. You won't regret it.<br />Macon man uk.
B00003CXAR|4.0|A Classic. About a man-eating shark that terrorizes beaches during the summer. 3 men go out on a boat to kill the shark. They find out that the shark is a lot bigger then they thought it was. It turns their summer into a deadly nightmare. Jaws even eats one of the 3 men, Quint. While Quint is spitting up blood, one of the others is down in the water after jaws attacked the cage he was in. If you want a good fright but not too harsh, this is a perfect movie.
B000001DTM|5.0|Nearly 10 years after it came out, this album probably holds up the best of their enire catalog. While many think the Joshua Tree was their best, it just does not hold up as well. It was just that JT was so hyped and hailed as ground breaking, and at the time U2 was at their most popular. When AB was released, other forms of music were starting to make inroads (grunge, etc.) and one could argue that U2's popularity was starting to decline. However, this album definately stands the test of time.
0380789019|5.0|I fell absolutely in love with this tale!  Neil Gaiman has an imagination that just pulls you in.  I am waiting for a sequel - where is the Lady Door's sister?  There is enough material here for a series.

B0000524CY|2.0|I heard this movie was the ultimate of scary but I beg to differ.  My mother and my friend told me that it was really scary and I was like ok lets see how it goes.  It was completely pathetic.  I didn't find one shred of scary in that movie at all.  There were some cool parts like the spider thing down the stairs but not scary.  It was probably one of the most disappointing scary movies.  It may have been scary back then but frankly its as childish as a Disney film now.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If u like the movie then you'll love the soundtrack. I was not that excited to see Moulin Rouge since it seemed had a bad ending. It was above and beyond my expectation. It was funny (especially the Like a Virgin song) and sad at the same time. Ewan and Nicole were great, their voices weren't dissapointing (in other word I trully enjoy their singing). Most of the songs on the CD are great just like in the movie. And I agree with some of the people that this CD's lacking that 2 songs: Like a Virgin and Spectacular, Spectacular (both of them are very funny). Overall this is a 5 star just like the movie. It made me want to see it all over again. ^-^
B00005AR3G|4.0|I bought the dvd, I started playing it.  The audio started skipping in the scene where Kronk goes after the fly.  That whole chapter the audio was not good.  There were many differnet scenes where the sound was skipping like.  I could not watch the whole movie.  I returned it for a new one, the exact same problems at the same places.  I went back and got a credit at the store in a different state, where I live (that is where I bought it).  I then went to Blockbuster to rent it, in the state where I live.  The same exact problems in the same places.  I still have yet to see the whole thing.  Has anyone else had these issues???
0679745203|5.0|I will endeavor to keep this review as brief as possible:<br />I have not read that many books, to be honest with you; but Ondaatje's &quot;The English Patient&quot; is the most enjoyable of all the ones that I have read.<br />Ondaatje's style is unique and one can see that this is a poet at work; the breadth of his vocabulary is immense and his extravagant use of poetic devices make the book a work of art. Suffice it to say that I have never read a novel which incorporates so much of the literary scope into one product: this is not just a novel; it's poetry and art as well.<br />The only thing I did not like about this book is that, at times it can go off topic a bit and become quite drab- but this is the exception rather than the rule, and the novel as a whole is very enjoyable.
B000000XCF|5.0|Great continuance of Creedence music .Cotton Fields doesnt do that much for me unless you'r rollin' drunk But if you'r a real rebel ,Fortunate Son is the number to PUMP UP LOUD.
B00000AFWZ|1.0|it said on the box that it was original punk rock...this is not punk it sounds like stuff my dad like. i know alot about punk and it wasn't in the 60's... it happened a few years ago when green day came out don't be fooled if you want to here real good punk, by the new blink 182 take off your pants and jacket cd or the mark tom and travis show cd by blink it really good and much better than this...
6305537313|4.0|If you have read Capote's novella, it is impossible to take this film seriously, especially its second half.  Not because of some bogus complaint about 'respecting the book'.  The first half works so hard to 'code' the unsayable (e.g. watch Paul rescuing the South American from the police raid), that when a conventional love story develops, the whole narrtive becomes lopsided.<br />It's a shame, because there are so many cherishable things in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', most of them emanating from cinema's most extraordinary actress, Audrey Hepburn, giving an emotional powerhouse of a performance that breaks through the phoney conception of a 'real phoney', and becomes a moving commentary on her career, her image, her past.  'Moon River' sends shivers and wells tears like no other moment in film, and Jack Warner must have had cloth ears if he thought that voice wouldn't do for Eliza Doolittle.  <br />Edwards brings a rare visual intelligence to his treatment, using the devices of 1950s melodrama to provide an ironic commentary on characters with no self-awareness.  The sunny melancholy and love of New York (especially the 'breakfast' odyssey, complete with shoplifting sequence borrowed from Melville (Jean-Pierre, that is)), the use of caricature to define difference from a makeshift community, all point to another great New York masterpiece, 'Seinfeld'.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead's new album &quot;Amenesiac&quot; is a terrific album.  I am tried of so called fans and critics talking bad about radiohead because they actually decided to be different and make music.  Everybody seems to believe that you cannot have a song without a catchy hook and a guitar riff.  Radiohead has proven the fans and the critics wrong. First, with their masterpiece Kid A (yes i do believe this album was masterpiece) and now with Amenesiac.  The only questionalbe song on here is Pulk/Pull revolving doors and even that is entertaining every once in a awhile. this is a great album.  It is worth every penny spent a hundred times over. I wanted to give the album 4 and 1/2 stars but i couldn't do it.
B000000XCA|5.0|the only bad thing about this classic album is the empty spaces between the songs. So do yourself a FAVOUR,BUY it,GET it and PLAY it LOUD  OKAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
B000002H2H|5.0|Man is this a great CD! It's great thrash music! If you like Metallicas new stuff, buy this CD and see their REALLY good stuff!
B000000W5F|4.0|Well, Ive listened frequently that this is the last worthwhile Stones album. Im not a Stones fan, I have only the albuns people say are their best: BANNKET, LET IT BLEED and this one here. THis is good rocking.
B0000035E7|5.0|Nirvana was an awesome band. In fact they still are. Many people believe that Nevermind was their first album. Woah, they are completky wrong about that one. Bleach is their first full LP. Its a great album too. Recorded for 600.00 bucks (As if that fact hasn't been stated enough) it is not at a very clear hearing level. But that is the beauty of it. It had that gritty, grunge feeling to it. Nevermind was to polished compared to this. Bleach has some real rockers on it, such as &quot;Blew&quot;, &quot;Paper Cuts&quot; and &quot;Scoff&quot;. Listen to the double floor bass drumming on &quot;Scoff&quot;, its cool. Also, Bleach has its share of pop-ish songs on it. &quot;About A Girl&quot; is extremely catchy, and radio friendly. As is &quot;Love Buzz&quot;. Enjoy!
B000000XCH|5.0|Their peak music POWER ALBUM , starts off with the just the incredible,raw ,INSANE RAMBLE TAMBLE  and then goes right thru the other classics. run thru the jungle,put a candle in the window,etc. get this album you cant go wrong .
6305165912|5.0|The Big Lebowski is the funniest movie I have every seen.  Although I think it needs a certain type of person to appreciate it.  If you don't like &quot;off&quot; comedy than this isn't the movie for you.  It has a highly complex plot that took me 2 times through to completely understand.  It is a great movie.
B000002J1F|5.0|A lot of YES fans say this is their best albuns. A lot of rock books and encyclopedias say this is their best album. So, I began my YES collection with this album. Its really great. Howe, Wakeman and Anderson. What more do you want ? Of course we all know progressive went out of fashion very fast, but the sheer quality of the songs here is amazing.
6304007523|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the greatest films I have seen. It speaks to us!  It's about love, passion, honor, courage, dignity, failure, old age and plain old heart wrenching hard work!  The story of Rocky is universal and we have seen it many times in other films but Sylvester Stallone works an incredible magic into this movie.  Incidently he was in a very similar situation as Rocky when he made this movie. <br />Rocky is basically a man who let the years go by and found himself a clubfighter and muscle to a loanshark at about age 30. He is basically a bum and a failure in life.  No one treats him with respect because I suspect people could sense the greatness that could have been.  Even Mickey the trainer sais this.  The woman he loves is incredibly shy and he is going nowhere fast. The heavy weight champion of the world, Apollo Creed picks his name by chance out of a book and Rocky is picked to fight him.  <br />I love ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and Rocky is suddenly given an incredible chance to prove himself one last time.  He knows that he can not beat Apollo but if he can only survive the fight he will know that he was not just another bum.  It is really a battle of the human spirit.  A battle against ourselves.  The fight is incredible.  The mucial score by Bill Conti is breath taking.   Rocky is beaten (badly) and in the final two rounds he falls down but (ignoring his trainers pleas to stay down) he agonizingly gets to his feet.  This is a moment in the film that will make your heart stir.  I always tear up at this sceen.  You see, Rocky had been down his whole life.   This was his last chance to prove to himself that he wasn't a bum.  When they are announcing that Apollo Creed is the winner it is insignificant because Rocky won the greater battle.  The battle of the human spirit.  The last scene of the couple hugging is a beatiful scene of friendship and love.  As you can see I love Rocky.
B000002BBY|5.0|This iis the best album ever to grace this planet. This band will nodoubt live forever, if they simply continue to write such scrumtrilecent music. Scrumtrilecent is not a word, because there is no word to desrcibe the scrumtrilecense of this album. Buy it, if you like EmiNem, Fenix TX, Jagged Edge, Shania Twain, or Menudo, then buying this Album will truly enlighten you.
B00003CXN4|1.0|I have no idea how on earth this movie won any oscars.  Trafic is without doubt one of the worst movies ever made.  No point, no action, no plot.  Awfull movie.
0805062971|5.0|His name is Robert Paulson.<br />Fight Club is an excellent film by director David Fincher because it breaks the rules by not fitting the mold of your average, boring &quot;Blockbuster&quot;.  Thank goodness for that!  Many are unaware that Fight Club was a novel by Chuck Palahniuk years before the film, and fans of the film should DEFINITELY check out the book.  <br />The film does a great job at keeping the same fast pace and content of the novel, but the novel has a few extras that make it worth reading especially for those looking for a quick, entertaining read.  Fans of the movie will really enjoy the extra stories about Tyler Durden that weren't covered in the film.  Palahniuk writes in a way that makes it hard to stop at the end of a chapter, the reader is captivated to keep going and before you know it, you've finished the book.  <br />The basic storyline involves a man with no name who talks in first person about his mundane life.  He's an insomniac who eventually finds a way to feel complete AND get some sleep at night.  More or less he starts a Fight Club with new friend Tyler Durden and many unique things happen for him at this point in his life.  This may not sound EXTREMELY appealing but I could divulge much more information to make it sound crazy and great, however, I wouldn't want to spoil anything.<br />Upon completion of the novel, many fans will realize how well it was adapted to film which also makes the film that much more of a gem.  For those who have neither seen the film nor read the book my advice would be to read first and then watch.  You will NOT be disappointed.<br />If the body goes limp, the fight is over.
B000002J1B|5.0|Yes' Most Frenetic, Most Kinetic, Most Invigorating Work.  This One Is The Exact Opposite Of 'Tales From Topographic Oceans'-It's Hard To Believe They Were Released Less Than A Year Apart.  This Will Make Your Heart Race And Your Pulse Pound.  Buy This Just So You Can Scare Your Friends.
B00005IBGQ|1.0|By the time you read this, you will probably have already seen reviews saying what a great album this is. This won&#8217;t be one of those reviews. You may have also heard how you need to hear the songs a few times to really appreciate them. This won&#8217;t be one of those reviews either. Singer-songwriter (and critic&#8217;s darling) Rufus Wainwright just released his second album, Poses. Wainwright obviously likes to get under your skin. Unfortunately, that happens as soon as he starts singing. Producer Pierre Marchand, best known for his exquisite work on Sarah McLachlan's albums, tries his best to make this a worthwhile effort. Maybe he should&#8217;ve brought in someone else to do the vocals. The stripped-down arrangements don&#8217;t help matters either. It&#8217;s not the songs that are the problem--it&#8217;s Wainwright&#8217;s whiny voice. Could it just be an acquired taste? Possibly. Have I acquired that taste yet? Not even close. <br />If you liked his first album, you&#8217;ll probably like this one too. Unfortunately for Wainwright, if you weren&#8217;t already a fan, there&#8217;s nothing on Poses that&#8217;s going to change your mind.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Conglomerate musical groups made from established talents making concept albums usually sound plodding and indulgent, yet this album is the complete opposite.  The Gorillaz are an intense combination of musical styles and animation/illustration art that creates a multimedia buffet for the senses.  Quirky, enjoyable  music meanderings encompass rap. provided by Del tha Funky Homo Sapien, indie exotica from Miho Hattori, and mainstream pop kookiness issuing throughout from Damon Albarn of Blur.  At first listen, the more memorable songs are 'Clint Eastwood', 'Rock The House' , '19-2000' and 'Tomorrow Comes Today' and on further listening, all the peronal oddity of the group becomes obvious through songs like the manic 'Punk' and horror revive of 'M1 A1' which starts with the opening lines of the classic gore film 'Day of the Dead'.  This debut album is absolutely brilliant listening, and accomodates long hours of repeated listening; music to relax to, music to work by, music to dance with.  Albarn's London roomate Jamie Hewlitt provides a comic book fascade for the group supplying an animation art style that blankets the album and insert, and adeptly adorns their music videos, enhancing the music.  The group also has a website which combines music, art, sound, information and oddities making Gorillaz the best multimedia experience going in this new millenium.  In a time of rather highly hyped over heated media sensation boy/girl bands, repetitive rap acts and droning inexpressive guitar bands, the Gorillaz are a fresh, light hearted alternative that haven't nearly begun to wear out a very warm welcome.
B000002J20|5.0|This Album Can Make Me Cry.  Yes It's Long And Not For The Faint Of Heart, But That's Why I Love It.  This Album Goes Straight For The Heart.

Listening To This Will Lower Your Blood Pressure And Make You Live Longer, So BUY THIS NOW!!
B00003CXS4|4.0|I am a true believer in a strong soundtrack...If I was making a movie, a killer soundtrack would be a must.  Tarentino's movies may be &quot;stylish&quot; with &quot;hip&quot; dialogue, but its his &quot;ultra-hip&quot; nack of picking the right songs from his music vault that truely makes his movies what they are.  Same with Guy Richie... In Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, sure he had cool characters and whitty dialogue, but it was his insertion of equally cool songs that brought the movie from average to &quot;cutting-edge cool.&quot;  Pete Wingfield's &quot;18 With a bullet&quot; the Castaway's &quot;Liar Liar&quot; and a collection of oddities and favorites from a variety of musical genres brought the picture to a head. In &quot;Snatch&quot; we find a movie that is peculiarly similar to Lock Stock, maybe too much so.  It has the same random characters, and the same way of bringing the different characters in different scenes back into one another.  We have the same whitty razor's edge dialogue...and the same compolation-cool-various music-genre soundtrack throughout the movie as well... Songs like Klint's Diamond fit well...but as a huge fan of both the specials and the stranglers I was really glad to see &quot;Ghost Town' and &quot;Golden Brown&quot; on the soundtrack... he even includes his wife Madonna's bubble-gum-teeny-bop classic &quot;Lucky Star&quot; as well.  It is a good movie, but without the soundtrack...I've seen it before (ie. 70's Blaxploitation cinema like Willie Dynamite et al, and Tarentino's works- esp. Jackie Brown/Pulp Fiction). You dig? PEAAAAACE!
0805062971|3.0|OK, so this is obviously not true, as the movie was based upon Mr. Palahniuk unusual book. This book is definitely interesting, and was able to maintain my interest as I read through the plot twists of Project Mayhem. However, as I saw the movie first, this book seems a pale imitation of an excellent movie. I am amazed at the job done by the screenwriter (whoever that may be, it might be Mr. Palahniuk himself, I don't know), as the movie does an excellent job of portraying the double personality of the main character. The book does an average job, but I was constantly referring to my recollection of the movie to realize what was actaully happening in the book.<br />I read in another review (a five-star review) that if the book were half as good as the movie, then he/she would not be disappointed. Well, if the movie was an A+ (100%), then half as good would be an F (50%). While I would go that far, I would definitely say that this book did not live up to my expectations (C-).<br />Whereas before I was highly awaiting the next movie adaption of a Mr. Palahniuk work, I am no longer so excited. Perhaps I will see if the same director/screen write team up for the next adaptation, and that may rekindle my interest.
6303160344|5.0|This is an amazing film. It is visually stunning, and the story, while heartbreaking, is also liberating.  Binoche's character plumbs the depths of loss and the soul of despair, and rediscovers who she is in the process. The music will haunt you, too. I can't praise it enough--I've seen it dozens of times and never tire of it.
B00000JGEI|4.0|Okay, all who know me know that I like movies that have good plots and good scripts. (Mainly because I'm an aspiring writer/director.) However, as most people know, action movies do not have neither of what I like to see in a film. A few months ago I watched this movie by a friend's and was amazed. The plot was terriffic--a great sci-fi with a twist of horror--and the script was outstanding. But there was one problem. Arnold Schwarzenegger. In my opinion, he is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He's your typical action hero, like Sylvester Stallone. However, it works in Terminator, because he's playing a robot, so I can see him not showing emotion. A few days ago I bought this movie. It has all the elements of a great story, and I can't wait for the release of T3 (yes, they are making it.) So here's the thing. The action is great, the acting is good, the plot is outstanding, and the script is wonderful--thanks to James Cameron. If you're like me and against movies of this kind, think again with Terminator 2. Watch it once. I think you'll be just as surprised as I am.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Okay, let me start off my saying that yes STAR WARS: EPISODE 1: THE PHANTOM MENACE is not the BEST SW movie ever to grace the screen. It has its flaws, yet then again so did the originals. As Randall on &quot;Clerks: The Animated Series&quot; pointed out how the hell do lightsabers know where to stop? But that's off the topic. The reason SW:TPM works well as the starting off point for the greatest cienmatic saga of all time lies in its ability to explain how everyone came together. In this film you learn how Anakin and Padme met. How Obi-wan became Anakin's master. How Palpatine began his rise to power, and how everything was his doing through the film.  True there are some flaws in the fact that Obi-wan is trained by Qui-Gon, instead of Yoda and Anakin was supposedly a great pilot when Obi-Wan met him yet in the film he's just a boy. BUT Obi-wan is still under the guidance of Yoda, and Anakin is the only human that s good enough to PILOT a pod-racer. What TPM does it basically tell the viewers that it was here that everyone met, that this is how the entire saga's &quot;cogs&quot; were set into motion. And for the eagle-eyed fan, you'll notice that everything was planned by Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious. That the events of the film were all meant to bring about his rise to power. Now with the DVD. A moment to drool.... Oh yeah! Anyways, with the DVD's inclusion of the seven deleted scenes, which are wonderfully completed with full visual effects; storyboard to animatics to finished film; the &quot;Beginning&quot; documentary; audio commentary with George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Ben Burtt, Scott Squires, John Knoll, Dennis Muren and Rob Coleman; Five behind the scene featurettes; the music video; the twelve part &quot;lynne's diary&quot;; a gallery of poster and the like; and all the trailers, from tv to theater. this 2 disc DVD set is, well Drool-tastic. I can't believe they're doing it! Buy It! I've already preordered mine! Now we just have to wait for the rest ofthe series!
B00003CXN4|5.0|This is not an action film. Stallone does not blow up any buildings and Keanu Reeves does not do kung fu (thank god!)....This is an astounding film representing the drug world as it is in the present day. A docu-drama, with amazing performances by all (especially the award winning Benicio del Toro) and brilliantly directed and mostly hand-shot by Soderburgh himself, the film deserved every award and bit of acclaim it got and more!! For anyone so easily distracted by a &quot;mind-boggling&quot; 3 storylines, 3 different tints to the screen, and anything shiny, or who's just lookin for a movie with a perfect ending, this is not your film. Traffic brings up many interesting points about how we are dealing with the drug war, and how everyone is so easily affected. Some bash Traffic for not having a clear answer, and too much irony: Well, there is no clear answer to the drug war, watch the film and you can see that. Listen while the arrested drug-smuggler explains how things are operated, and listen as the teenagers explain how drugs are easier to get than alcohol these days. Its true, and if it makes you re-evaluate the world around you, then good, Traffic has made a start.  This is not your average movie, cast or storyline. It stands above the rest of the fast-paced, no-thought-required films of our time, and shouldn't be so easily overlooked because its not directed by Bruckheimer.
B0000509C4|3.0|This movie is so FUNNY I almost cried! Funnier than the first one. The coolest one was the one with the blob, although it isn't very funny as much as it is suspenseful....which this movie is supposed to be both scary and funny. The funniest one is &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot; it was ssssssooooooooooo-O funny!
B00005J73X|1.0|I was disapointed with this CD.  After ripping off the rock band Heavy Pettin with their song In An Out Of Love  it's about as much as I expected.  Bring back Pettin any day.
B0000029AP|5.0|Aerosmith and Get Your Wings had fine moments, to be sure, but it was with Toys in the Attic that the group blossomed into an excellent band.  Every tune on Toys is so well recorded and arranged, they stay fresh and enjoyable after years of repeated listens.  Find me a person who's toe doesn't start tapping to Walk This Way and I'll dig the hole.
B000050FEN|3.0|&quot;Seven&quot; is contrived and predictable, with none of &quot;Silence of the Lambs'&quot; suspense or narrative urgency. It tries to be artistic and cerebral, but ends up seeming pedestrian, even when trying to shock. Good acting by all the principals can't redeem the plot's artificiality. If you want to see Fincher's best by far, get &quot;Fight Club.&quot;
B00000K0E5|3.0|Pierce Brosnan as Bond? That's what I thought, too.  But after Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton, Brosnan seems almost palatable. Efforts by the studio to bring the series back to reality beginning with Dalton continue here, but with a darker more Batman-like look to the sets and characters.  This &quot;updating&quot; is rather effective, clearly seperating this film visually from it's uneven past.<br />The Brocolli studio, perhaps sensing Brosnan would have difficulty supporting the series single handed, added the new M -- played to perfection by Judi Dench.  She adds an incredible amount of depth to the film, acting as a quasi parent and friend to Bond.  Brosnan and Dench clearly have great chemistry together, so there willl always be a little something to look foreward to if they continue keeping Dench's profile high.<br />In terms of story, Goldeneye is lacking a strong central villian, but the sexy russian assassin who wants to crush Bond between her vice-like legs makes up for most of this in pure sexual charisma.  And she does a pretty good acting job, too.<br />But by the end of the film, an over-the-top tank chase with Bond at the wheel completely ruins the film, reducing it to the level of the most cartoony Roger Moore Bond.  Stay the course, you cowards!
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar is more nonfiction than fiction, which was and is the attraction for me. A long time fan of her poetry, and having read a few of her biographies, finally coming to this book shed much light on multiple aspects of her life that I had not seen before. For any true fan of her work, this is a must have.
020530902X|4.0|Detailed enough to be enormously handy, but short enough not to be obnoxious, this book is the ultimate pocket writer's tool. This book presents clear solutions to niggling questions of grammar, punctuation, and usage, as well as handy points on how to write clear, concise prose. If you spend any time writing, professionally or recreationally, you will find this book invaluable.<br />I give it four stars only because it's not quite comprehensive, and more complicated questions of punctuation and usage may require the consultation of the Chicago Manual of Style, or some similar volume.
B00003CXN4|2.0|Traffic was a neat movie just because I live in Columbus, Oh and lived in Cincinnati, Oh.  There are 3 stories going on in the movie, which eventually merge together, somewhat.  I guess if you liked &quot;What lies beneth&quot; you will like this movie.  But I think that the hype of 4 academy awards drew alot of people in to the theater, but Notice no academy awards for acting.  Overall I am glad I didn't waste my time driving to a theater to see this film.
B00003CX5P|1.0|THis film is only so-so and does not live up to the hype.  It is a pale shadow of the incredible original star wars trilogy.  This one was obviously made jsut for the kids.  It has the look and feel of a Disney film rather than a Lucas movie.  It also has the storyline and character development that one would expect from a 1980's Saturday morning cartoon.  Waaaay to much screen time is devoted to the bumbbling antics of goofy Jar Jar Binks that only the 5 and under crowd can appreciate.  Also, Anakin's acting is horrible and there are many sloooow parts where he talks to Padme or his mother which require ready access to the fast forward on your remote.  The villians, who are most interesting get very little screen time which is disapointing in and of itself, but also leaves the viewer to wonder at the end of the film: Why did they villians do all these terrible things?  The films only apparaent answer is that they are the bad guys and the good guys need bad guys to fight.  There was not much to explain the plot or tell why the characters were acting as they were.  I've heard many fans say that this is just a set-up for E2 and E3.  Still, this film should be able to stand on its own.  If The original 1977 Star Wars film was this weak and blamed it on &quot;setting up for ESB and ROTJ&quot; the star wars franchise would have been dead right then and there.  Still TPM has some redeeming qualitites.  Liam Neeson is good.  There is a very visually exciting pod race, and the lightsabre battle at the end is pretty cool (and unfortunatly its really the only time you ever get to see more than a few teaser seconds of Darth Maul, who could have been cool if they utilized him more than for just the final battle.  Hopefully the extra scenes in the DVD version will help eplain a lot of the unanswered questions and premises on which the film is based so that it will make sense.

B00004X01U|4.0|I've been a fan of Madonna's for a long time and loved 'Ray of Light'. I hold it as her best work till date, even after having heard 'Music' till it popped out of my ears!! The excellence that Madonna achieved with her albums 'Something to Remember' and 'Ray of Light', if not totally diminished, is visible in 'Music' to a lesser extent. 'Impressive Instant' is uncannily Savage Garden-ish! 'Amazing', a barely modified version of 'Beautiful Stranger'. As far as lyrics go, &quot;Cool I am when I'm with you/ Cool I'm not when I'm lonely&quot; is as good as they get in this album. Only 'I Deserve It' and 'Don't tell Me' have traces of Madonna's otherwise lyrical brilliance. This album is aptly titled, because the music, the beats and rhythms shine out more and are THE focus rather than the lyrics, which is a bit disappointing for fans who are used to the depth of songs like 'Live to Tell,'Take a Bow', 'Forbidden Love', 'Power of Goodbye', 'Substitute for Love', to name just a few. But, this album entertains and it has a good balance of fast and slow numbers, 'Gone' being the best among the slow ones. 'Music' is not typical Madonna. It is Madonna wearing her latest chameleon skin!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|The visual effects of this movie (sets, special effects, camerawork) were awesome and stunningly beautiful, and the acting in this movie is wonderful!  The songs are great. (I found myself singing along to most of them in my head.)  If there is one word to describe this movie, it is this: beautiful.
B000001Y42|1.0|I remember the good old days when Limp Bizkit was something you listened to to escape the pathetic tedium of pop melodies and over the top rap artists, what went wrong? Jon Davis put it well in his duo with Limpman himself 'Fred Durst needs to rehearse, needs to rehearse, needs to rehearse.' The 'singing' is shoddy and the guitar patterns are tedious. Place this next to, perhaps below Papa roach, at least they're trying to sound good. I recently heard some '20 dead flower children' -go buy that instead. On the up side every song on it is musically and lyrically better than 'Rollin'

B000002I2G|4.0|1968's WAITING FOR THE SUN had become The Doors' first #1 album, courtesy of the Kinks-sounding (some might say plagiarized) hit single \\"Hello, I Love You\\". That was only appropriate because the Doors had become slightly more pop-perfect since the gloomy masterpiece that was their self-titled debut. Perhaps wanting more of the widespread success that WAITING FOR THE SUN brought to them, The Doors went further with the follow-up, THE SOFT PARADE. The result turned out to be one that nearly cost the Doors a whole slew of fans. Granted, the orchestra-augmented \\"Touch Me\\" was a top 10 hit, and certainly as catchy as \\"Hello, I Love You\\". But the Doors' longtime fans felt the band had really sold their souls for success, and THE SOFT PARADE became the Doors' lowest-selling album ever. While the whole of the album is somewhat misguided, THE SOFT PARADE does have a few bright spots. I'll admit \\"Touch Me\\" is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, because it is catchy as hell. However, songs like \\"Tell All The People\\", \\"Wishful Sinful\\" and \\"Runnin' Blue\\" are a bit more worth looking into for the fact that \\"Touch Me\\" has been just a bit overplayed. But all three of those songs were written by guitarist Robby Krieger. He wasn't a bad songwriter at all, but Jim Morrison's bleak poetry was what made the Doors what they were, and he must have been in a bit of creative drought during THE SOFT PARADE, for Krieger claims almost half the writing credits on here. You've got to wonder what Jim was thinking about when he was singing Krieger's lyrics. Indeed, in the way of writing, Morrison is a bit on cruise control for songs like \\"Easy Ride\\" and \\"Wild Child\\" are somewhat second-tier versions of songs that he has done better many times before. \\"Shaman's Blues\\" is a little better, as is the closing title epic. But \\"The Soft Parade\\" is definitely not up to the standards of \\"When The Music's Over\\", \\"L.A. Woman\\", and (although I hate it) \\"The End\\". A little too psychedelic and free-verse for my tastes. Before THE SOFT PARADE was released, the Doors made headlines when Jim Morrison exposed himself at a concert in Miami. As if that negative press wasn't enough, THE SOFT PARADE's rather diluted sound only continued to make the Doors a bit of a pariah in rock music. They would regain some credibility with the next album, but had they stopped at THE SOFT PARADE, the Doors may have gone down in history more for their leader's antics than for their great music.tastes.

B00005LMBK|4.0|Unfortunately since I live in America I haven't heard much about gorillaz or seen any videos on tv.  I did however find some video clips of them on various websites and the animation is awesome.  I'd really like to see one of the videos on mtv.  That's probably not going to happen soon though.  I really only heard about them because I am a fan of blur and have looked forward to this side project for a while.  <br />There are so many good songs but some of my favorites are the singles Clint Eastwood and 19-2000.  Definitely good choices.  Rock the house and latine simone are pretty cool but the best track is unquestionably slow country.  I downloaded a bunch of mp3's before this cd came out and I was surprised that some of the songs weren't included.  Hopefully they'll be  b-sides or something<br />I'm glad to say I haven't been disappointed.  This cd is such a great mixture of many genres of music.  I can't imagine anyone not liking it.  The mood of the album fits perfectly for driving around at night.  I'm sure I'll be listening to it for most of the summer!
079284632X|1.0|As close to snuff as any film in the seventies managed, technically inept, a pornographic rip-off of Bergman's &quot;Virgin Spring,&quot; and overall, just hideous.  Yes, the brutality left an impression.  Is that what you are looking for?

B00003CXRM|4.0|If you liked that quirky movie &quot;Fargo&quot; (I did) then your going to Love &quot;Brother&quot;. George Clooney plays a wonderful &quot;good ole' boy&quot; with a hair fixation. Lines like &quot;We thought they done luved you up and turned yall into a toad!&quot; or &quot;Daddy, Momma said you got hit by a train&quot;, when taken in context will make you roar. It a delightful comedy with a bit of &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; thrown in for good measure (chain gang, &quot;man with no eyes&quot; sunglass wearing guard, bungling fellow escapees). There's even a bit of the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; at a KKK meeting. Remember the evil witches guards marching and singing. Well it's here too! See this movie, you'll love it, or at the very least be entertained. Isn't that what it's all about?
B00004XOWM|3.0|Three Dollar Bill was a great debut, and Significant Other was a pretty good sophomore effort, but Chocolate Starfish leaves something to be desired. There are some good songs here, but overall the album stands as a dissapointment. Many of the songs lack the usual emotion Fred puts into his lyrics, along with the fact that many of the songs are downright annoying, such as Hot Dog, Getcha Groove On and the second version of Rollin', to name a few. There is, however, the usual goods from Fred and the crew. Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle) is a fun song to listen to, and most of you would probably also like My Generation, although I didn't. My Way is kinda good, but not the best. My two favorites are the MI:2 theme Take A Look Around, and also the most mellow song on the album, Hold On, which is a real change from Limp's style; one might even call it a ballad. Overall, though, I feel I got enough good songs to make this album worthwhile. Hope you like it.
0195067142|5.0|This is one of the finest books I have read.  It is haunting.  The writing is plain, simple and honest.  Sadly, I just learned that the author, Eugene Sledge, died recently.  I would have liked to write him a letter to thank him for what he endured.
B00005LMBK|5.0|A smooth mix of hip-hop and rock n roll the gorillaz have poped on the scene from littarly no where (being as they are cartoons).  The talents of many of the more popular bands out there today fuel this cd that powers its way with lyric after lyric.  A strong sense of almost a perfect cd lines every track. M1-A1 starts with an errie almost lost darkness around it, and turns into one of the most outstanding tracks.  This is one cd that every one should have in thier collection
B000003TAR|5.0|&quot;All in all is all we are&quot;<br />NEVERMIND may have been the record that blew almost everything else away, but IN UTERO was the one that finished the job.  Every lyrics is worth quoting, every song worth singing.  It's rough around the edges and pure grunge.   If you fell in love with the cleanly produced sound of NEVERMIND, this record may take a little bit of getting used to but you will get used to it.<br />Tracks like &quot;All Apologies&quot; and &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; are melodic but tracks like &quot;Frances Farmer...&quot; and &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter&quot; are all rebel-rock.  Smells like punk spirit. You can hear the desperation and the cries for help in every word but you dont know whether or not Kurt was crying for you or for himself.  Next to the Beatles, I believe Nirvana has had the most universal appeal in their songs than any other band.  Its especially strange that a few punks from Seattle could do this, especially considering how personal the music was to them.
B00005B36H|1.0|I like tool's music, i'm not a huge fan but i have the albums and was genuinely looking forward to hearing the new album. I like a different sort of tool to most people - i like the tool songs like 'Crawl Away', 'Sweat', 'Intolerence' and 'Eulogy'. I don't like the songs like 'third eye' or 'disgustipated'. What i am basically trying to say that i am unnapreciative of ...their new album. It's boring and there a basically no proper songs on there there is now 'prison sex' or 'stinkfist' on this album. ....If you're new to tool, buy 'opiate' or 'undertow' instead....
0783233477|5.0|Loosely based on the three acte play &quot;Death Takes A Holiday&quot;; This film brings more depth and dimension to the concept of the original story than perhaps even the playwright could have dreamed of. The main focus and character of the film's story line is &quot;Death.&quot; And since death is a something of an esoteric topic and not exactly a character you can readily research; I think anyone would have to applaud Brad Pitt's performance in this role. There is nothing superficial about this movie. It is deep and it leaves a few questions for the viewer to figure out and yes, there are answers. It needs to be viewed more than once to really gather it all in. Anthony Hopkins plays Bill Parish, the next mortal on the list that &quot;Death&quot; Brad Pitt's character is supposed to call on and take from life. But, you discover through the dialogue that &quot;Death's&quot; curiosity about life has been peaked by Hopkins' character to a point that &quot;Death&quot; can no longer resist. So, &quot;Death&quot; makes a deal with &quot;Parish.&quot; He gives &quot;Parish&quot; time in exchange for a tour of life's experiences. The film brings into focus the things that are most important in life and how so often they are put aside for other things until most of our life has gone by and deeply marks the difference between sympathy and empathy. &quot;Meet Joe Black,&quot; is clever, funny, touching, romantic and very insightful. Performances by most of the cast were outstanding. The film did seem to move a bit slowly in some scenes, and I feel this is really the fault of direction rather than script or acting. Thought provoking and worth viewing again and again.
B000002BHE|5.0|I am really getting to love this gal.  The very first cut had me completely mesmerized due to her heartbreakingly dramatic delivery.  And then the very familiar &quot;Just Say You Love Me&quot;...the CD just goes on and on with strong likeable material, including my favorite, &quot;All By Myself&quot;.  There is a strong balance in the CD, alternating between the strongest and the more mellow.  I only have two Celine CD's so far, but will definitely have more.
B00004STDN|4.0|&quot;Cliffhanger&quot; is one of those movies where the suspense sequences and action stunts outweigh everything else by a landslide (pardon the pun). There's really not much to the development of characters or plot, except that the movie uses the script as an excuse to put its characters in extremely dangerous situations one after another. On this ground, it works splendidly, and while the story and characterization are weak, there are still some good performances turned in by the cast. <br />The movie sets itself up with the promised white-knuckle action in a sequence that brings on the tension but fails to move us emotionally. On his way to retrieve his best friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) and his girlfriend, Sarah, from a 4,000 peak, Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) makes an attempt to rescue Sarah after she begins falling, without success. Hal blames it on Gabe, and Gabe's own self-torment keeps him from town and from his own love, Jessie (Janine Turner). This move, while meant to establish emotion and character depth, doesn't do a whole lot for the script. <br />The movie then transfers us to a U.S. treasury plane, where three cases of money, in bills unusable except by a select group of people in the world, are being flown across the country. The plane is soon hijacked by a group of terrorists, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). However, his plans are ruined once they lose the cases at high altitude and crash in the Rocky Mountains, where they call for help under the guise of being in danger. <br />Sparing the rest of the movie's twists and turns, once Gabe and Hal arrive on the scene, they are taken hostage and forced to climb mountains and hike through forests to find the three cases of money, soon bringing more people into the situation than the movie calls for. <br />The movie chooses to focus more on the action than on the story itself, which really isn't that bad a move. From the high-altitude stunts to the white-knuckle suspense generated by the scenes charged with high-octane suspense, the movie doesn't lose its ability to get our attention with actors hanging on the edges of cliffs and mountains, holding on for dear life. <br />The tension generated by the terrorists is, at best, mediocre. Even under the shadow of leader Lithgow, whose flair for turning a colorful phrase at every moment is funny yet unsettling, the movie never really gives us any reason to fear the henchmen along for the climb. There are certain moments, such as that in which the only black terrorist hunts Gabe and Jessie in a cavern, or when Gabe is trapped beneath an ice-covered lake. However, the only people the terrorists knock off we aren't given too much time to know, so what reason do we have to care? <br />Stallone is back in fine form, the action hero we've always admired from his earlier &quot;Rocky&quot; days. He's required to carry a lot of the heroism on his shoulders, and big as those shoulders are, that is no easy task. Yet, he is able to pull it off, with the help of Rooker and Turner, who give jobs well done in their roles. <br />While not the best action film ever made, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; is a commendable piece of suspense that works due to its breathtaking action sequences and the altitude of its settings. It tends to drag in places, but really, with a movie that's so focused on getting us into a sweat, what does it matter?

B00005K3O4|1.0|The wonderful joy that is created by the DVD release of this movie is ruined by the fact that this is currently a fullscreen-only version of this movie. No letterbox - pretty much ruins it in my book.<br />I give the movie 5 stars for being so great.<br />I give this DVD 1 star for being a lame, fullscreen-only release.<br />Please say you found this review helpful if you wished there was a letterbox version! Maybe it'll get noticed and fixed before they actually release it.
B00005AACC|1.0|MI2 is the worst movie I've seen in years.  Horrible story; stupid, cartoonish characters; bad editing; bad cinematography; plot hole; annoying music; and the list just goes on and on.<br />From the openning, MI2 tries to convince viewers that Tom Cruise is some kind of indistructable super man; and tries to prove this point through out the movie: from killing a dozen bad guys without break a sweat to collide in the mid air with a another person and get right back up.<br />Why did Tom Cruise recruit that girl is beyond me, since she has done nothing through out the film, except to make Cruise look like James Bond.  If she was anything, she was more of a burden.<br />The story and characters are cartoonish and idiotic.  Nosense plot.  Cruise seems to know before hand which bad guy he's going to meet, and has a mask of that particular enemy ready.<br />Slow motion artist my behind.  All those slow motions really slows down the action.  Too much editings.  Every action sequence seems to have been edited a dozen times from a dozen angles.  And how am I going to enjoy the action, when I all I can see is Tom Cruise's face.  Very dumb shots, like a dove through the flame, wow, our hero is coming, hope is coming, weeee!  Jhon Woo's obsession with close up shots is at an all time high.  I have never seen this much close up shots in my life.  \\"Slow motion arts\\" are horrible, it took tom cruise half a minute to pick up a gun.<br />This music [stunk].  The only music that's listenable is the intro music.  Sound effects are horrible.  Guns, bullets, cars, mortocycles hurts my ears.<br />The final battle scence is very boring.  If you really want to watch good fighting, go see crounching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, that movie doesn't have a dozen \\"slow motion art\\" to slow down the action.  Plus, in CTHD, battles were shot from one or two prespectives, thus satisfying like an opera, unlike in MI@, in which the battle were shot from a dozen different angles and were edited a hundred times, and the final product was Tom's facial Gallery.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorillaz is an excellent ablum.  It offers everything that I had expected from an album that came from such a diverse background. 2-D's vocals are phenomenal along with Murdoc's, Noodle's and Russel's musicianship.  Russel provides the percussion and the spirit of his dead homies provide the skill and rhymes.  Noodle only speaks one word of English, and that is noodle.  Murdoc plays the vital role of Murdoc in the band.  2-D is plagued with migraines parlty caused by Murdoc's crazy driving.  This band really came together supernaturally and literally lives through the music.
078322804X|5.0|The greatest movie EVER.  'nuff said
0060392886|4.0|This is a pretty cool book, but if you are not a fan, I don't think you will really care about this stuff.   The only problem I had with the book was the truth.  There is some stuff that seems it was added for entertainment value.  None the less, it was an easy and entertaining read.
0380973650|5.0|After waiting several years for Neil's new book, I hungrily devoured the 400+ page &quot;American Gods&quot; in just over two days. The story follows Shadow Moon, recently released from prison, as he comes to work for a man simply known as Wednesday.  Wednesday is a peculiar old man with a frightening knowledge of Shadow's past and an amazing talent of swindling people who introduces Shadow to many fascinating characters, who it is later learned, are all transplanted Gods endeavoring to hold on to life all across America.<br />Gaiman explores the sacred power hidden in the kitschy roadside attractions doting the landscape of America's many back roads; their once glorious power waning as people worship more modern cultural icons and ideas. The sprawling story pits the forgotten gods America's immigrated citizens brought with them to the new land against the high-tech gods of modern living in a war for the very right to be worshipped. Shadow is pulled headfirst into the dispute and ends up playing a crucial role in the upcoming battle. The meanings of life and death, self-worth, spiritual beliefs, and redemption are all explored with Gaiman's witty intelligence.<br />Gaiman's ability to entwine multiple plot lines with clever cultural critiques while maintaining fantastic character descriptions and an engaging narrative solidifies the fantasy/horror author's place as one of the world's best storytellers. Much more than a magical tale of combating Gods, Gaiman paints a picture of a melting pot left too long to boil, and a country who worships the next big thing a bit too easily and with little consideration for it's ancestry.<br />Definitely worth buying, and undeniably worth reading (all though you might want to slow down a bit more than I did!). And while you're at it - check out \\"Stardust\\" and \\"Neverwhere\\", you won't be disappointed.

B00005IC52|5.0|I first saw Black Christmas in 1984.  I was a fan of horror movies but had no idea that they came as good as this.  the atmosphere it creates is overwhelming.  It is as much horrifying as it is eeeeeeerie.  It is without a doubt in my mind the most brillaint horror film I have seen.  Sure, Halloween has special moments too, but this movie is so much more - why?  It doesnt contain those stereo-type boogie men.  Sure there is a killer but he isn't wlaking around with a mask on.  Black Christmas succeeds in that it makes the viewer hang on to the edge of the seat.  All you want to do is yell at those people to get out of the house. I promise you, you will love this movie.  I have had no luck locating it in video hire shops (out of print), so will buy my own copy. Watch it in the dark!
B00003CXPD|4.0|This is a heartwarming film, made all the more delightful by the wonderful, breakout performance of newcomer, Jamie Bell, in the leading role of Billy Elliot.  The son and brother of coalminers, Billy is given boxing lessons by his father but is drawn, instead, to learning ballet. So, he surreptitiously takes ballet lessons.  When his father finds out, all hell breaks loose, as in the macho world of his coalminer father and brother, this is tantamount to a sign that Billy is gay.<br />Billy's teacher, however, thinks Billy has talent, and attempts to persuade the father to permit Billy to audition for the Royal Ballet School. At first, the father refuses. He is ultimately won over, when Billy gives him a private dance performance so passionate that even he is moved, So, Billy then goes off to London for the audition. What happens next is sure to move even the most stone hearted viewer.<br />This is ultimately a film about hope and the ability to realize one's dreams. Well acted, it is a film that is sure to delight the viewer. The only real flaw in the film is the sound quality, which tends to be somewhat uneven. All in all, however, this is an excellent film and well worth watching, if only for Billy Elliot's dance scenes.
B000009QPK|4.0|While it may not have been Slayer at their Reign in Blood peak, Decade of Agression nevertheless captures them following their heavy Seasons in the Abyss album and is a great summary of the Dave Lombardo era.  21 songs, so at least almost all of your Slayer favorites are here, and the speed seems to be turned up even from their frenetically fast studio albums, they're really blazing through these. I can't give it five stars because of the production though.  The guitars wail on the solos, but during the songs they don't stand out enough (the sound isn't that dynamic, you can't clearly tell the guitar/bass/drums/vocals apart).  Plus the speeded up versions do make the songs all run together, particularly on the second disk (what made Slayer albums great was the juxtaposition of killer fast songs and haunting mid-paced songs, and here they're all closer to being the same speed, so one song sounds too much like the next and it diminishes the power of some of the slower songs).  Plus Tom doesn't do the screaming high vocals that he did on the studio versions of some of the Show No Mercy and Reign in Blood songs.  But these are minor complaints, if you want an intense live thrash album, this is the one to go for, and if you want an overview of Slayer's 1983-1990 career, this is a good record to start with.
0792107683|5.0|I love this movie and consider it to be one of my all time favorites.  Alan Ladd is always terrific in every movie he is in.  I loved the story line and he was great as a gun slinger in his indian style clothes.  I love Van Heflin too, he was always a wonderful actor and played the part of the homesteader very well, he is a dynamic actor in any part he plays.  Its always good to see the bully's get their comeuppence.  And Shane made it happen.  I just wish the ending could have left him there starting a better life than the one he had always lived.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I think that this is an absolutley amazing soundtrack. If you have read ANY of the other reviews you already know about the missing tracks, and Ewan Mcgregor and Nicole Kidman's fabulous voices. That's all very true, and I do hope for a second CD. Also when I saw &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; (which Ewan Mcgregor also sings in )I thought his voice was awful, but in this movie his voice is outstanding. &quot;Your Song&quot; is one of my favorites, along with &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; ans &quot;Nature Boy&quot; (but I'm a David Bowie fanatic). In another review awhile back someone said said that you had to be at least 21 to appreciate this soundtrack, which is VERY untrue. If you enjoyed the movie you should love it!
B000002MG1|5.0|Although a very melancholy album, I think it is their best.  All the songs on it are awesome.  I can't say that one song on it is better or worse than the next.  I would also recomend &quot;Monster&quot; after buying this album.
B00004XONN|5.0|I was never a Radiohead fan.  I don't like &quot;electronic rock&quot; (or whatever this CD is classified as).  I decided (wisely) to experiment on something different.  It is hard to classify this albumn, so I won't.  There are so many different sounds and styles intertwined together.  Most of the songs are really, dare I say, pretty sounding.  I especially like the last track, which is short and sweet.   Try this CD, you might not love it, but at least you tried.  And you might become a huge Radiohead fan like me and maybe you will steer away from the common ground in musicland.

B000002AVF|5.0|I grew up on this cd my mom played it when i was like 7,and i'm still listening to it thats cause it's an amazing album.Another plus about Mariah is that she writes her own music and not like lots of these artists who write maybe a paragraph in the song and have other people write the rest of it.She wrote mostly all the lyrics except for a few and about 50% of the music the only song she didn't wrie was &quot;Open arms&quot;. Miss carey will be around for a long time cause she can write-sing-dance-and hopefully act.Anyways I recomend this album for anyone who loves pop/r&amp;b.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I thought this soundtrack really rocked. I love how they mixed in the modern day music with such a long time ago. You would think that wouldn't work but Nicole and Ewan pull it off well. Nicole suprisingly has a really good voice, a lot better than expected and I'm glad to see something working for her after this whole Tom thing. But to me Ewan had a really really amazing voice and should do more singing! They have really good chemistry and their voices sound really good together, besides the album has a lot of other awesome songs besides Nicole and Ewan. I LOVE the Elephant Medley, and this is one of the first CD'S i've ever listened to where I like every single song, not just Lady Marmalade, which is the reason most people are bying it it seems. I  recommend it.
6304083769|4.0|Widely popular on both sides of the Pacific, Ghost in the Shell was a revolutionary anime that set the standard in animation, and questioned the existence and fate of man. On the surface, you have a simple story; In the future, synthetic humans are developed with the same features as any normal human being, except for a real soul, referred to as a Ghost. Major Kusanagi, a cyborg herself, and her unit are to track down a terrorist known as the Puppet Master, who is able to hack into anyone's Ghost. The movie is incredibly realistic, and some of the animated scenes are simply breathtaking. The dubbing is good, but there's an unnecessary amount of cussing, probably to make things more realistic, or something....<br />The movie at some times crawls at a terribly slow pace, presenting lengthy showings of atmosphere, or talking about humans and existence. There is a LOT of talk about individualism and creation, but it&#8217;s at a very simple level and gets boring fast. Spectacular action scenes break up the monotony; the battle against the miniature tank is absolutely the most realistic gunfight I've seen in anime, hands down. Unfortunately, the action scenes appear sporadically and only introduce and finish the film. The curse of the slow-moving plot is enough to bring an anime down to its knees, but Ghost in the Shell remains standing. Barely, though. The 30-minute \\"making of\\" feature after the movie is a great extra; how many VHS tapes do you see with extras? I appreciate this anime more every time I watch it. This was THE anime of 1995, and no anime fan should go without seeing it.
B0000025L8|5.0|It has been 21 years since this album came out and it is one of the very few (besides Elvis Costello) that I have bought and re-bought after losing several times.  I always come back to this album, and it always has something relevant for me.  After two decades, Rebel Waltz still makes the hair on my neck stand up. This album fills me with hope that at least at one time, punk stood for something.
6303481272|4.0|This is one of the most well-known anime existing, and for good reason; this is truly a unique piece of work. You have a vagabond ninja named Jubei Kibigami who is forced to fight the eight devils of Kimone, led by a man whom Jubei had killed once already. Accompanied by Kagero, a woman immune to poison, and Dakuwan, a crackpot from the Tokugawa government, Jubei begins his quest. The artwork and animation are fantastic, and the fight scenes are unique since each devil has a certain ability and a certain weakness as a complement to that ability. The final showdown is the best part of the movie, as it should be. The dubbing is very good too. <br />On to the bad stuff: the plot can drag at times, even though it usually picks up at just the right time. The uninspired &quot;ancient Japanese&quot; music melded into the background, and many scenes could definitely have used a cool tune. Gore and all-around oddity are rampant. Worth a watch.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The movie might not have been the creme de la creme of star warts movie (in my opinion it was still better than jedi) but how can you not be exited over the dvd release of a star wars movie?  It is why i bought a player in the first place.  Sure, Fight Club and Toy Story 2 are good discs, but even though the movies might be better, they are nothing compared to any star wars film.  My sound system is ready.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|As a director... this is with out a doubt Kubrick's best work... I don't think any director can achieve what Kubrick did in Barry Lyndon...<br /> Some savages might find this film boring... Well , It's not an action film... And it is a little bit long... But I think it's perfect... the story has so many stories within.. <br /> Prolly it's not Kubrick's best movie... but the directing is flawless...
B00000K0DT|5.0|Top-notch thriller with an ending that you'll never expect...fine acting by Spacey, Byrne, and Singer, etc...clever plot twists...and all the fun of a good movie. Buy this movie!!!
B00005LMBK|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. I got it because Damon Albarn was on vocals and I love Blur. The whole cd is awesome, it's experimental and it all has a great sound to it, I absolutely love it. The art work is also awesome and the website that goes a long with the cd is amazing too, this is just an overall excellent cd with catchy tunes, it's fantastamatic, so I'll quit boring you all and just stop writing.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead won me over with _OK Computer_, specifically with the song &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;.  _Kid A_ was another step of brilliance.  _Amnesiac_ continues the trend and gives me another album to adore.<br />Things start off with the reflective pairing of &quot;Packt Like Sardines...&quot; and &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;  The former picks its way through a tumbleweed-strewn techno-steppe, odd metallic beats combining with mosqutio whines and more warm synths in a post-future lullaby masquerading as an uptempo number.  The latter subdivides 12/8 in a swaying motion more reminiscent of waves than desert, all with a haunting piano riff and some of the best singing Thom Yorke has done in his career.  By the time the strings roll in, the piece has blossomed from torch song to full-on anthem.<br />All of this lushness is abruptly smacked in the faces by the brutal, mechanistic funk of &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot;.  The piece growls, sneers, and thuds harder than most hip-hop you'll hear on the radio, while helium voices rant about different types of doors one will encounter.  It was at this point that I fell completely in love with this album.  <br />The track order manages a great sense of cohesiveness because of the disjointed nature of the songs.  What else could you do after the evil stomp of &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; but place the navel-obsessed meandering of &quot;You And Whose Army&quot;?  How clould that not dovetail into the lazy groove of &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, which itself blends into the breezy jangle of &quot;Knives Out&quot;?  The ebb and flow makes for compelling listening; even after you've memorized every song, the ordering will still take you by surprise.<br />BUY THIS RECORD.  Listening to it once, even if you don't like it, will be well worth it.
B000003S5H|5.0|This is on heavy rotation. I love this c.d. . It's so relaxing and cool at the same time.  I think this is one of their long play c.d.'s. They did the soundtrack to &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; and I heard that it was not long enough. This is great French music. It makes you feel like you are in a serious version of Austin Power's.
B00005LMBK|4.0|all the blur fans know that our man D. Albarn (D-2) is incapable of writing bad tunes, which is a good thing... anyways this is a stellar record. the thing that sticks out in my head the most though is the way that the guitar is used basically to just accentuate the tunes, there are no guitar songs on this record... not that guitar tunes are bad... the super furries clearly illustrate this.. but its nice to see it have a secondary supportive (that doesnt sound like radiohead) role... the old school beats are kickin hard, and the funky sound effects are implemented very well... two other points before i forget.... the quirky organ and synth riffs are readily available for all the parklife and great escape fans... i.e. - &quot;Double Bass&quot;... and for all the musicians the sampling capabilities of this record are heartily abundant... its 15 bucks who cares??? pick it up. also..... del's rhymes are not too shabby either. kinda makes you think about how the next blur album will sound like? dont forget to pick up Graham's new one.
B00003CX5P|5.0|finally the wait is over ford the first star wars dvd. from the looks of it, its a pretty kool dvd with over 6 HOURS OF BONUS MATERIALS, from deleted scences to lucas commentary. Somethings that i would have like to see would be a isolated williams score or a dts track. An early rumor is that a teaser trailer from episode 2 will be on the disc. Pretty kool. Stay tuned
0440219078|4.0|I had to read this book for school.Exactlly I had to read it for the subject english. First it was a big problem to understand the text, because my english is not the best. But under hard work I tried to understand everything. Now I am glad that I have worked as hard as I did. The Book is really a exciting. It is a very interesting thought of future. Furthermore the book stimulates to think about life in our world, about life in future and I thought very much about communism, beause of the sameness in the book. But I give &quot;The Giver&quot; only 4 stars because of the end. The book ends very suddenly. You get the empression that Louis Lowry wanted to end the book very fast. General: It is a good book and if you want to understand my topic you should read the book :-)
0060930187|5.0|it's a shame that Sylvia Plath did not have the opportunity to write more fiction.  This novel is funny, insightful and haunting.  Her sense of humor is fantastic, I've read this book over again and I'm amazed at how right on she can be.  Free from the &quot;find your inner child, what mommy and daddy did to me&quot; psychobabble so overabundant in the &quot;when I went a little cuckoo&quot;  books of our era, Plath's telling is fresh, honest and different. (I'm not poo-pooing societies ability to get in touch with themselves, perhaps if Sylvia Plath had lived today she might have been able to cope better, I am just remarking that it makes for a different kind of read).
B00000K19E|2.0|The film has a very interesting philosophic idea, and the plot is indeed unpredictable. But the movie itself is too bad. The main idea was well developed but it was not entirely original. It was taken from Total Recall and The Nightmare on Elm Street. And it was also unreasonably violent. All people around there were enemies. It was ok for the main hero to enter the federal building and start killing everyone he sees. What this movie teaches our children and us? The plot has too many holes. Why, for example, people have to die in reality if they were killed just in the dream? There was nothing great or special in the special effects. The actions were intense but still too primitive. Characters were not well developed. Bad acting. I was disappointed with this movie. It does not worth watching even once.
B000001TVD|5.0|This is the core of Funkadelic's best work. This album is a definitive acid funk psychedelic journey. Including the legendary &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;, where guitarist Eddie Hazel takes you into a dreamy realm of space and emotion. &quot;Hit it and Quit it&quot; is an amazing funk jam with one of the baddest, stankies riffs in all of funk. Wille has obviously never experienced drugs or can appreciate the sounds that pour out of your speakers when the needle hits the record from start to finish. Funkadelic was big on LSD at this time and it shows in this work. Their first album and &quot;Maggot&quot; display the best of this style. Eddie Hazel is Jimi Hendrix's funk clone.
B00000JCOV|5.0|See, the reson Slipknot is so hard to let go of is that they have a lot of what I stand for. Now I will get sick of it, and like most of my bands, I'll come back and listen to the CD a bunch more a month later. That is becoming pretty hard for me with Slipknot. The lack of cords in MOST of their songs, it makes it all up with some hardcore energy. As we really see in my favorite track &quot;Liberate.&quot; Which also has a lot of samples and scratches in it. &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; is the more &quot;Passionate&quot; as people call it, track. It's a pretty good track they released as a single. And then their is &quot;Surfacing.&quot; Their theme track. The one that goes, &quot;[***]it all, [***]this world, [***]everything that you stand for.&quot; And then there is a little &quot;Don't Ever Judge Me&quot; part that I really just enjoy because being judged [stinks]. It's also the track where their guitars arn't that simple. So those are my favorite trax and I give them a 5/5 for putting in a little bit of everything I like minus full humor. But that's not enough to take away a star.
B000000IRB|5.0|This is an excellent album from an excellent group. Pink Floyd's best album can only get better.
B00005LMBK|4.0|This CD is great, I downloaded it after hearing the first single thinking it would be the only good song on the whole CD however I was proven wrong the sound is something completly new and the lyrics are out of this world so if you are looking for a new sound buy this CD they are sure to be very popular very very soon
0385486804|5.0|Jon Krakauer is a curious and intriguing reporter.  Again and again he shows his willingness to question common assumptions and dig for the deeper truth.  It would be very easy to dismiss &quot;Alex&quot; as a misguided idealist and an outdoors novice. Krakauer questions these easy conclusions and discovers a deeper truth as he explores the how and why of what makes a young man with a promising future all laid out for him turn his back on civilization.  It's also an intriguing exploration of the relationship between fathers and sons.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Of Hitch's &quot;big four&quot; (Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho, Rear Window) this is the one that has aged the most gracefully. Perhaps this is because it is the simplest story of all his classics. Rear Window finally gets the royal treatment with a DVD collector's edition. Hurray! Jimmy Stewart is just a master of the everyman. His plodding style suits Hitch's slow build-up incredibly well both here and in Vertigo.
B00003CXDG|1.0|This movie just plain sucked.  The special effects were okay, but the stunts on the motorcycles were crap.  Look close and they magically switch between street tires and dirt tires.  The story was weak at best and the slow motion was so abundant that it is a joke.
B000002UAU|4.0|This album certainly expanded the boundaries of what pop music could be, but in doing so strays a little far from the roots of rock for my tastes. I find the almost complete absence of George Martin's name from other reviews to be vexing. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison all do their part, to be sure, but I don't think George Martin gets enough credit (not just for this album but for The Beatles, period). In short, it's a must-have, but on the whole, give me Revolver.
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade is as soulful as ever.  Her hiatus from music hasn't changed her one bit.  I'm so thankful she's given us more music.  Her songs are on my list of the most beautiful songs ever.  Keep on doing what you're doing!.
0452282152|5.0|This book was one I kept contemplating reading for several weeks.  I finally picked it up and am I glad I did!  As an art lover, it gives you an inside look on the tecnique of making paints and who sat for artists in those days.  But even if you dont enjoy art, its a fabulous and exciting story.  Grete is full of gumption...rare for a maid in those days.  As a reader, you can only love her.  Its good till the very last page!  One of my top 5 reads.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I love this CD.  My all time favorite song is &quot;Kiss of Life&quot;.  Sade's voice is so beautiful.  Whatever the mood of the song she can make you feel if.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is my first Limp Bizkit Cd.  Familiar with only a couple of songs on CD, I was blown away with every track.  Every song is completely unique and terrifically put together.  The band are genius'.  All the songs encourage turning up the volume button and getting up to dance.  It's impossible to sit still and listen to the power beats.  The tracks listings make it easy to listen to this cd over and over again.  Hot Dog, My Generation, My way, Rollin', Gitcha Groove On are going to be Classics to LB fans and convert those who aren't.  I'm dying for LB to start their US tour so I can see them jam in person.  This CD was worth every penny.
B00003CXN4|4.0|Pretty good movie, only saw it once, comical yet informing, no movie of the year, but it wasn't expected to be.  It's a prime example on how any rich/political figures can swindle and what goes on with thier familes. Micheal Dougles did a good job, as did Benicio Del Toro...Reccamended movie..
0201633612|5.0|This book is for Software Designers or Architects; if you've happy being a code monkey don't bother buying it.<br />Some of the examples were in Smalltalk.  I had never /seen/ a line of Smalltalk code before, and did not have difficulties following the Smalltalk examples.  I am familiar with C++ though.<br />The book is heavy; I not only read it not only once but twice.  It will be hard to appreciate and understand the patterns without using them.  Like a decent math book, it cannot instantly plant the knowledge in your head; it takes some practice.  If you do not feel you would be (or would have been) capable of teaching yourself calculus, then there's no good reason to believe you will be able to teach yourself design patterns (though there is more material to cover in calculus, it's about the same difficulty and level of abstractness as design patterns).<br />The reason I believe some people have disliked the book is for one of two reasons; they had insufficient knowledge of object oriented languages (Java complainers), or didn't understand that design patterns are extremely abstract concepts.  You should know that C++ doesn't have first class functions and that Java only has single inheritance.  Fully implementing patterns in Java will be tedious if support is not already built-in (i.e. Java's Listeners are it's implementation of the observer pattern).  With C++'s MI and macros you can build some template base classes to implement \\"pattern plumbing\\"; like the ATL for COM.   I will also concede that the book is not perfect, but it is the best one available on the subject of design patterns.  In 7 years no one has done a better job.<br />One complaint I have is that the language is so plain it hurts.  I now greatly appreciate the dry wit of Charles Pretzold and the zanity of Andre LaMonthe.<br />P.S. The diagrams are not in UML.  Since UML requires a book in it's own right, for simplicity sake they didn't use it.<br />1999 BS Computer Science &amp; BS Mathematicsfrom Lawrence Technological University, \\"Theory and Practice\\"<br />Magmai Kai Holmlor
0553278398|4.0|This book (while not part of the original Foundation trilogy) is great read if you like the Foundation Series and need more of it.  It's a prequel to Foundation and fleshes out the world in which Foundation takes place.   It was written in the 80's when he went back to writing Foundation books.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is one of the few movies that I enjoy watching over and over. Each time I view it, I discover something new in the story or scenes. It has a rare and interesting plot, and it appeals to the imagination, emotions and intellect. In this age of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, &quot;e&quot;-everything and cyber-everything, the theme of the movie is a relevant piece of work. A friend of mine said that he does not like the movie because it is &quot;unrealistic&quot; and far-fetched. Well, to those who feel this way, I would like to say that it is, after all, a science-fiction movie, not a science documentary. As a sci-fi movie, it has to go beyond what we normally regard as &quot;realistic&quot; , and The Matrix certainly stretches way beyond those boundaries.<br />This is also one movie which is even the more interesting and mind-blowing when followed with other on-line resources or web information, such as the numerous uncanny Biblical parallels and symbolisms (such as Neo readily sacrificing himself to save humankind from the deception and bondage of a malevolent force, then coming back alive to defeat his foes), as well as analysis of some of the characters and their names.<br />I first watched the movie simply for &quot;eyes-lolly&quot; Keanu as Thomas Anderson, but as I watched the video again, I find the other characters growing on me too, such as Trinity, Morpheus, Tank, and yes! even the 3 agents Smith, Jones and Brown, esp. Agent Smith. All in all, it is a great movie with a good cast, cool, stylish stunts and special effects.
0553293397|5.0|What more is there to say? It's Asimov and it's great. I just wish there was more of it.  This was the last robot novel he wrote before taking many years off from it and so it still has the feel of the original.
B00001NFCY|4.0|This Cd was pretty good, but i didnt like how alot of the songs sounded the same.  what i like in a cd is having all different kinds of styles, and with this one, if you hear one song, you have pretty much heard them all, i liek Higher, With Arms Wide Open, and what if.  the other songs just sound too alike though.
B00005ABX0|5.0|I always knew the old Beach Boy classics but recently got into Pet Sounds.  I wanted to hear what could have been of the Smile album so I got this CD.  The smile stuff is good but the big surprise to me is Wild Honey.  It's a great R&amp;B album.  Unlike the other Beach Boy albums.  I really enjoy listening to it.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Dream Theater is the greatest progressive metal band ever to record, with Rush being their only competition.  The Scenes From a Memory album was brilliant, and this DVD reflects that.  The extras, such as Change of Seasons, are great.  I will buy everything that DT ever puts out, and you should too.  They are truly artists.
B000002MTU|5.0|This is the most awesome cd of clapton's i've ever heard. If this album doesn't make you cry, i don't know what will.
B000001E18|4.0|The story of Zooropa is certainly one of the most interesting for a U2 album.  Originally planned as an EP for release while the band was still on tour, it turned out to be a full length album.  While critics and everyone talk about POP as being U2's foray into &quot;techno&quot;, Zooropa is, in my opinion, the band's most experimental album in terms of sound.  With the exception of Passengers, which was not a U2 album per se, but a U2 &amp; Eno album, Zooropa is the most unique sounding of the band's output and definitely the more techno-oriented.  The eerie soundscape of the title track, the loops and samples in most of the songs, this is U2 as you've never heard them.  Therefore, it's not unlikely that fans will think U2 went too far, got too &quot;arty&quot; with this one.  But like every U2 album, the passion is there.  Unfortunately, not one of these songs was played live in America until the latest tour (Elevation) when the band added Stay to the playlist.  That makes this a sort of &quot;forgotten&quot; U2 album in some ways.  (The great Lemon Perfecto mix was played in America, but that doesn't really count.)  All in all, some great sounds on this record, and some of the band's strongest moments (Stay, Numb.)  Highly recommended!
630382336X|5.0|This the best ever done by the beatles. The beatles olny spent  $175,000 on the movie and the record. They put the record out before the movie and it made $350000, that is 200% just in a few days. Then they put out the movie. It made $8000000 in its first week. In that year $500000000, And i can see why!!!!!!! ! From A Hard Day's Night to If I fell to You cant do that this is a great film. On parts of the movie they were not acting, is was live.

B00004WG2F|5.0|According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness.  Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy.  They become legend.  And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect.  \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" directed by Edward Zwick, is the story of Tristan (Brad Pitt) and his brothers, Alfred (Aidan Quinn) and Samuel (Henry Thomas); a tragic story of the life they shared and the wounds they suffered, many of which were never to heal.  And it's their father's story, as well, for it was he who raised his boys with only the help of his loyal friend, One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis), after his wife, Isabel (Christina Pickles), unable to withstand the harsh Montana winters, had left her family for the more civilized East Coast, never to return.<br /> Colonel Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) had served his country during the Indian Wars, after which, disheartened by the government's treatment of those they had suppressed, the proud people of the Indian Nations, he turned his back on the \\"civilized\\" ways of his own people and carved out a niche for himself and his family in Montana.  And it was there, on their ranch, that the boys learned the ways of the West and the ways of the Indian, under the tutelage of their father and One Stab.  But of the three, only Tristan eventually heard that inner voice with such clarity that he could neither deny nor ignore it, and it awakened a passion within him that he embraced, and which set him upon the path he was seemingly destined to follow; a path that would ultimately affect the lives of everyone he had ever loved.<br /> By 1914, Europe was at war, and the very tenets of truth and justice that had driven Colonel Ludlow away from society now compelled his sons to take a stand according to their own beliefs.  Despite his recent engagement, Samuel decides to go to Canada and enlist in the army in order to fight for England.  Alfred and Tristan refuse to let him go alone, and enlist with him.  And in the desolate, muddy trenches of France, they soon learn the harsh truth and the reality of war-- just as their father had before them-- and by the time the war has ended for them, their lives have changed forever; Tristan's most especially.  Back home, Tristan tries to settle down to life on the ranch, but the restlessness of his soul speaks to him of things he must do and places he must go, and the voices are too strong to resist.  So despite the ties that bind him to the home and the people he loves, he sets out on a journey of self-discovery that eventually takes him, physically and emotionally, into places he never knew existed-- and away from the woman who loves him the most.<br /> Director Edward Zwick delivers a sweeping saga of life and love with this film that is every bit as big and grand as the country in which it is set.  He presents his story through the recollections of One Stab, the one who saw it all unfold, first hand.  And it gives the film a narrative quality that is storytelling at it's best.  Zwick had a vision of how to bring this tale to the screen, and he realized it magnificently, aided by John Toll's breathtakingly beautiful cinematography (for which he received an Oscar), Lilly Kilvert's superb set designs and James Horner's compelling, dramatic score.  And most importantly, through the tremendous performances of Hopkins, Pitt, Quinn, Thomas and the lovely Julia Ormond.  <br /> Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses.  And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life.  Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers.  Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care.  It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.<br /> The supporting cast includes Karina Lombard (Isabel Two), Paul Desmond (Decker), Tantoo Cardinal (Pet) and Robert Wisden (John T. O'Banion).  A visually stunning film that will touch you emotionally and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark, \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" perpetuates the tradition of classics like \\"The Big Country\\" and \\"Giant.\\"  Engaging and memorable, it's a transporting experience, courtesy of the magic of the movies.
B00005AFMT|5.0|Can't say I'm totally familiar with a lot of KC's work.  A lot of their early stuff that people seem to love is just lost on me.  Discipline, however shows this band in a state of grace.  They capture the power of the Wetton/Bruford/Fripp trio, but ain't so heavy handed with the &quot;whomp&quot; of that trio.  Tasty is a word that could be used, among others for this disc.  I used to listen to this album daily, and thought about taking up guitar because of it.  I didn't, but the textures on this disc stay with me.
B00003652R|5.0|I have owned this album since it was originally released.  I have owned it in vinyl, cassette, and now CD.  Why do I continue to buy it when my old version wears out?  Because &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; is simply one of my very favorite albums ever. <br />This is a concept album, composed after the progressive rock style.  This is a intelligent, variable, engaging music.  The musicianship is superb; the songwriting is oustanding; and the lyrics are mesmerizing.  I own many (if not all) Marillion albums, and &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; stands out far above the rest, in my opinion.  This album is simply brilliant.  <br />All the songs flow together so that they sound like one continuous piece of music.  The moods range from gentle introspection to agressive defiance.  Fish passionately sings lyrics that are often cryptic but allow the listener to conjure up his/her own individual interpretation or images of what each song is about.  Other songs, such as &quot;Kayleigh,&quot; are more straight forward lyrically, dealing with more obvious themes.  And the band adds beautifully to Fish's words, creating a variable and always appropriate musical ambience.  <br />You simply have to listen to all songs on this album in order in their entirety to get the full magnitude of Marillion's work.  Every song is unique.  Every song is majestically performed.  Every song contributes to the magnificence of this album.  <br />I cannot say enough good about this disc.  I LOVE IT!
B00004Z459|4.0|When Linkin Park first appeared on my local radio station, I, like many people, wrote them off as a Limp Bizkit clone.  I am not, nor will ever be a fan of the rap/metal fusion that is popular right now.  That beeing said, Hybrid Theory is a remarkable album.  The music behind the band's raging lyrics is impressive, catchy, and well played.  Songs like &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; and &quot;In the End&quot; are extremely well written and performed.<br />The most amazing thing about Linkin Park is something that is lacking.  After I heard &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; for the first time, I didn't think that I had really heard the lyrics.  You see, ther is not one piece of foul language on the entire cd.  Not one.  I would be comfortable playing the cd with my grandmoth around (not like she'd listen but...)<br />&quot;Hybrid Theory,&quot; to me, stands above other fusion cds.  I recomend it.
6300216543|3.0|This is a good movie, but not Pacino's best. This is based on a true story, and you really get an idea of how corrupted the police force once was. I am a big Pacino fan and he plays the straight cop who will not &quot;be a cop on the take&quot; and he plays the part very well! It was a little slow moving at times, but still good acting.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I'd never listened much to the Red Hot Chili Peppers before, but I stumbled upon this album and found it incredible.  Much more intelligent than I'd ever thought they were.  After listening to some of their other albums, I find it incredible that they've been aorund this long and really have become better.  I definitely recommend this album.  And I definitely recommend anyone who likes this album to check out the music videos - Californication is perfect!
B000059TPN|5.0|The humor must have been written especially for the actors.  Connery and Cage make a great team.  They embody the humor their roles call for very well.  I'm a 14 year old girl and I love this.  Great action and very funny.
B00005LB9O|3.0|Travis is the archetype of the sensitive and inoffensive rock band. Don't push musical boundaries. Don't frighten or shock or question anything or anymore, lest it might lose you 'listeners'. At least they're honest. Travis write songs that are catchy and safe, tunes that you'll be humming innocently to yourself. 'The Invisible Band' is a step into the mainstream. There are more potential singles in the first half of this disc than their entire last CD 'The Man Who'. These songs are a throwback to another era, where 'pop' was fun and banjos were, ah, cool. Unfortunately, there's nothing here that comes close to the greatness of 'Driftwood' or 'As You Are'. For an album that could only be classified politely as department store music, this isn't half bad.

0062502182|3.0|I am not one for reading thick books but this one could have done with some more detailed storylines. Still, not a bad read for 177 pages.

B00001MXXG|4.0|I'm a 14 year old who watched this last Tuesday when it was on the WB and loved it. The only criticism I have is for making Ferris want to marry Sloane.  He knows she doesn't respect Cameron.  What makes him think she'll respect him?  You don't fall in love with someone who treats your best friend like dirt.  It just doesn't work.  He is clever enough to do a good job cutting school but he's not very wise when it comes to girls.
6305922748|5.0|INTRODUCTION: In 1982, an aging (40ish) English band is embarking on its 1st American tour in 6 years to promote a new album, &quot;Smell the Glove,&quot; which is not quite ready for distribution due to management dispute over its lurid, sexist cover art. Spinal Tap has had its commercial and popularity ups-and-downs since the mid 1960s. Although supposedly one of England's loudest heavy-metal bands, their catalogue actually includes a wide range of musical styles. The 3 primary musicians include guitarist and lead vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitarist and auxillary vocalist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and bass guitarist and background vocalist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer).<br />David is a somewhat pompous, pseudo-intellectual who likes ruffles, velvet and satin stage attire and has a rather pushy, astrologically attuned girlfriend (Jeanine exerts a major cosmic influence on David's life and creates a wedge between him and childhood friend Nigel). Nigel is a confused chain-smoking, gum-chewing, accomplished guitarist with strong juvenile tendencies, a love of kilts, and a knack for inane invention. Derek prefers a studs-and-leather stage presence but is perhaps the most intelligent of the lot and assumes the role of realist and peacemaker.<br />Filmmaker and fan Martin DiBergi (Rob Reiner) accompanies them on this tour to create a documentary of the experience, but Spinal Tap will later accuse Marty of making a &quot;hatchet job&quot; by portraying them in an unfavorable and unflattering light. Marty's film does tend to focus on the historic failings of the band, their apparent waning popularity, and the few(?) times on tour when they couldn't find the stage; had cancellations, production failures, embarrassments, and lapses in competence; bickered amongst themselves; acted like prima donnas; sported their herpes sores; and couldn't meaningfully or coherently answer his interview questions.<br />The film is almost entirely improvised from a skeletal plan. The comedy is subtly and richly layered with humorous but realistic character portrayals, malapropisms, double entendres, and numerous sight gags. Reality is only slightly skewed, with no in-your-face gross-outs or over-acting to emphasize the obvious. These guys are not only brilliant improvisors, but they are also fine musicians capable of performing a serious-but-quirky, full-length concert (1993 &quot;Return of Spinal Tap&quot; concert/comedy video). They really have written and performed all the wonderful lyrics and arrangements by themselves. Classics like &quot;Big Bottom,&quot; &quot;Bitch School,&quot; and &quot;Sex Farm.&quot;  <br />This film grows on you like an untreated fungus. Note that you probably will need multiple viewings (without interruption) to fully appreciate the humor and to become hooked, but you will love it more and get more out of it each time it is viewed.  <br />REVIEWER CONTEXT: 48-year-old female (a scientist and not in the entertainment or music business) who saw the movie for the first time (!) in October 2000 and who loves rock-and-roll (particularly the 1960s and 1970s &quot;British Invasion&quot; bands) but not raucous &quot;heavy metal&quot; sounds or outrageously gross personas. Comedy preferences include films such as the Monty Python features, the Pink Panther series, A Fish Called Wanda, Blame it on the Bellboy, The Birdcage, Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, etc. <br />THE PRODUCT(S): The new VHS tape (MGM Special Edition) adds 10 minutes of out-take footage, including the &quot;Bitch School&quot; music video. The new DVD (MGM Special Edition) includes an audio overlay for the film itself (ad-libbed, in-character commentary (&quot;defense&quot;) by the 3 principle musicians), about 70 minutes of out-take footage (presented sequentially like the film), a DiBergi update, 4 music videos (excluding Bitch School), other promotional clips, film trailers, advertisements and interviews. It caused me to buy a DVD player.  <br />There is also a 1993 VHS &quot;Return of Spinal Tap,&quot; which is a real London sell-out concert from July, 1992, interspersed (approximately every 3 songs) with comedy inserts and interviews; a 4.5 hour bootleg tape (presumably the original director's cut); 2 real CDs (1984 soundtrack and 1992's Break Like the Wind); a recent book (Spinal Tap Companion by Karl French) with transcripts, lyrics, and other delights; and older materials that are no longer available except through auctions. The out-of-print Criterion DVD from several years ago has a somewhat different selection of out-takes; audio commentary overlays from (1) McKean/Guest/Shearer as their real selves and (2) Reiner and the production crew; and the 20-minute demo tape originally made to try to obtain studio funding.
B00003CXC7|5.0|About as near to perfection as one can get.  A flawless suspense film.  I won't waste time detailing the plot.  Watch it. Great added documentary.  Another great restoration following Vertigo.  But it today!
0789723107|5.0|This book encompasses everything that I wish someone would have told me during my web design classes in college. If I were going to teach an interface design class, this would be the textbook. A conversational writing style and well thought out illustrations makes this book an easy read. <br />Steve Krug admits that most good usability is hindsight and while some of the ideas may seem obvious, I must admit I didn't think of a lot of them.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I can remember when my older sister (a Beach Boys fan) bought Pet sounds when it first came out in 1966. I asked her if it was as good as their other ones. She replied that it was too slow and that there were only one or two good songs on it. As a result of her negative assessment, I did not listen to this album for over 20 years! When I finally heard it, I realized that my sister was hoping for more surfing music. What Brian WIlson gave the world was a great pop album which shows that, as a composer, he was right up there with Bacharach and Lennon/McCartney. This album is understated. There are few bells and whistles. Some of the best ballads have to grow on you. But it is, consistently, of such high quality that it eventually becomes a favorite of most lovers of pop music. Wilson's production is amazing. His writing just soars. The vocals can make you swoon. It is an album to discover and re-discover again and again. If you are looking for a rocking album, you may be disappointed. If you are interested in finding out that Wilson could write pop music as well as Jimmy Webb, McCartney (who rates this as his favorite album), Burt Bacharach, definitely get this album and listen to it over and over. Amazingly, it is one of the few albums from the sixties that has not dated at all. It sounds as if it could have been released last summer! Barely noticed at the time it was released, its reputation grows with each passing year as one of the greatest albums of all time. Heartfelt, moving, gorgeous.
0452282152|1.0|I love Vermeer's paintings and traveled with a friend to Washington, D.C. to see his show at the Corcoran a few years ago.  I was looking forward to reading a rich novel about this painting and was quite disappointed by the writing.  I thought the premise was clever, giving life to who the girl in the painting was and using that as a springboard for the story about Vermeer, his life, his family,  and life during that period of time.  Tracy Chevalier's writing felt stilted, the characters were not fully developed, and I was left wondering why I had read it at all.  I would have been happier had I been able to give this a higher rating because I really wanted to.  Alas, it fell short.
B00000J7J4|1.0|This is hardcore pop in its truest form, at the same level as is all this Backstreet Boys/N Sync/Britney Spears/Ricky Martin/Sisqo/Blink 182/Celine Dion/Christina Aguilera/Shaggy/Lil'Bow Wow/I can go on forever ...! I don't understand why this \\"remarkable\\" guitarist could aim at such a generation who listens to Backstreet Boys or N Sync (oh, dear!); I figure he must have mistargeted to the commercial mainstream instead of making a memorable record. As one of those people who absolutely detests acclaimed artists who get so wound up in their popularity, they screw their own lives up (i.e., Wacko Jacko) and the commercial state in which America (the so-called \\"land of the free and the home of the brave\\") is now, I wonder how all of a sudden music could become so like this? Santana is a remarkable guitarist but I think on his next album he should return to his roots instead of doing stuff like this that the public will just ... down only to get sick of later. PLEASE listen to some REAL Santana such as his first three albums and you'll sooner or later see this album's lack of \\"landmark\\"!

0671034065|4.0|Mr. Perfect is quite a departure from Ms. Howard's earlier books such as Kiss &amp; Tell, Now You See Her, etc. - and for me, a huge improvement. While it still is technically a romantic mystery, her flair for comedy is wonderful!<br />The story revolves around The List, created by 4 female co-workers about what constitutes The Perfect Guy. Somehow the list falls into the wrong hands and spreads like wildfire on email and the Internet - the 4 ladies even find themselves being interviewed on TV by Good Morning America. All harmless fun - until one of the 4 women is murdered.<br />The main character, Jaine Bright (one of the infamous 4, of couse) lives next door to a police detective, Sam Donovan. Soon they are trying to find out who the killer is and keep Jaine from becoming the next victim. While the story is lightweight, the sharp and witty dialogue and deftly drawn characters and relationships are what held my interest. Jaine and Sam's burgeoning romance is laugh out loud funny and I found them immensely likeable characters. I only hope Ms. Howard's next book, Open Season, follows this latest trend.

Unlike the other crowe films, I couldn't find any enjoyable characters (save Jason Lee). The predictable story-line just doesn't offer any moments that come close to &quot;You complete me&quot;, and the ending will leave you unsatisified.<br />The actors are good, but I believe  a few were cast for the wrong parts.<br />Rent before you buy.

B00005LC4G|5.0|I absolutley adore the child's play movies. Both of these movies are great. In Child's Play 2 Andy Barclay is now living with foster parents and you guessed it Chucky has found him, what follows is murder, chucky funny one liners and good entertainment. In Bride of Chucky, his girlfriend (when he was a man) ressurects chucky and they end up going on a wild, gory road trip with two teenagers, Who are heading where chucky needs to go to get the amlet of his dead corpse of charles lee ray.

B000001DTM|5.0|u2 could never perhaps be able to top the magic casted by this masterpiece. words cannot describe the longlasting impression it leaves upon the listener. While comparing this land mark to awful ATYCLB is sheer stupidity. And whoever do this have definitely failed to understand what u2 might use to be in their glory years. Practically it stands no where near the the disgraceful ATYCLB. It was way ahead of it's time. And it's very hard to pick up which one is my favourite from this album. Songs like so cruel, one, the fly, who's gonna ride, ultra violet, acrobat are all great songs. The sheer creativity and brilliance of this album is unmatched. you just can't help yourself out except by playing these tracks over and over again. The band although certainly failed to produce the quality sound like this after this release. However the release of ATYCLB surely marks the death of the band.<br />So if you would have to choose one album from the whole u2 collection, this would be it.<br />AN EDGEY, MELODIC, ADORABLE, AND CREATIVE BEAUTY RARELY SURPASSABLE BY ANY BAND OF THIS KIND OF GENRE. GET IT NOW!
B000002672|1.0|THis was the ending of ACCEPT first streak of albuns featuring awful Dirkschneider on vocals. Up until &quot;BALLS TO THE WALL&quot;, the band survived through the sheer quality o their heavy rock, of Hoffmanns melodic guitar solos, Kaufamann and Bates steady rhythm section ( drums and bass ) and intelligent and simple lyrics. But, with &quot;METAL HEART&quot;, ACCEPT made it clear that they were changing...for the worse ! In &quot;RUSSIAN ROULETTE&quot;, the transformation was complete: rom a innovative and strong German act to a ridiculou bubblegum glam band trying to win the United States by selling out. Obviously, their effort backfired.

And sure there were a few minor things that I said &quot;Now wait a minutue&quot; because I personally Know how history went and I know the English were'nt that bad so sure Mel Gibson does have it out for the English I mean after doing The Patriot and all.But hey thats the old thought about History and Hollywood. Over all this movie is the undisputed champion of all movies.and thats why I give it 5 stars.
B00003CX8J|5.0|This is a beautiful, dark film that is perfectly cast.  The X-men and all their struggles really come alive in this one, along with some great action sequences and effects.<br />I have read this comic for nearly 35 years, from its beginnings to the present day.  Never would have I expected that these characters could be portrayed with any depth on the screen!  But they are in this film, from Wolverine to Cyclops.<br />Brilliant.  And better than all the other attempts to bring comics to the screen.

B00003CXRP|4.0|Having not yet seen CASTAWAY at the time of the Oscars, I was pleased when Crowe won Best Actor.  Gladiator was one heck of a fun flick.  However, I have since viewed the DVD of this latest Hanks' film and I am ready to declare him not just the best actor of 2000, but the best actor of our generation.  I bought him as time-obsessed.  I bought him as &quot;feeling&quot; the loss of his best friend beachball Wilson.  I was amazed at his physical transformation (I pray that I never read somewhere that it was a special effect).  I gave the film only four stars because the film, despite Hanks' efforts, became a bit too sappy at the end.  But you know what?  I watched it to the end.  The very end.  And that is another sign of Hanks' great talent.  He will not allow you to turn away from him.  You just can't do it.  He is the most watchable man in film these days.

Whatever the style may be, they have definitely made an impact on my life, as corny as that may sound ... Both this album and the 2nd one are masterpieces. Dax Riggs has such a beautiful voice ... I still get chills every time I hear &quot;Scream of the Butterfly&quot;. If you are a fan of AB, you should check out Sammy's band Goatwhore, and Dax's, Agents of Oblivion and his new one Deadboy and the Elephantmen ...
B00003CXN4|4.0|the original five hour BBC mini series into approximately 21/2 hours.  Unfortunately this was accomplished at the expense of character development and lack of logic.  The complete metamorphosis of the Zeta-Jones character from dependant housewife (albeit upperscale socially) to a ruthless, conniving, avenging &quot;angel&quot; was done too quickly without any time or subtlety allowed to lend at least a modicum of  credence to the transformation.  All in all, however, it was a very respectable film--well acted and produced. The source from which the plot was taken (BBC Series) was infinitely superior and was superbly acted.  Bill Paterson (in the Douglas role) and Lindsay Duncan (Zeta-Jones) were especially effective.  Duncan was positively chilling.  The film, however, is definitely worth seeing and certainly a lot more adult and satisfying than most Hollywood action flicks.  It's obvious that all concerned respected the source material and tried (and mostly succeeded) to present a quality film, esp considering it had to fit into a time frame that most film goers would accept.  Another bonus - it had the great Albert Finney in it!  Too bad he wasn't given more to do.
B000002INJ|5.0|The title says it all: Kings of Metal. Manowars previous albums didn't quite strike me as metal masterpieces but this one defenently is. <br />The album contains everything that a really good album should have. Manowar combines their early power with speed and melody. The singer Eric Adams shows a wide range in the singing. The first track &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; is a dark, speedy song with an almost deathmetal voice and two tracks later he uses a melodic voice in the metal-balad &quot;The Crown and the Ring&quot; and &quot;Heart of Steel&quot;. <br />All members of the band is at their best on this album. Joey DeMaio shows that he is the fastes bass-player in the world on &quot;Sting of the Bumblebee&quot;.<br />The songs &quot;Hail and Kill&quot;, &quot;Blood of the Kings&quot; and &quot;Kings of Metal&quot; are true Manowar songs with screaming guitars and a powerfull voice. &quot;Heart of Steel&quot;, &quot;The Crown and the Ring (Lament of the Kings)&quot; and &quot;Kingdom come&quot; are somewhat &quot;nicer&quot; with a sort melodic voice that you can recoginze on &quot;Defender&quot;.<br />This a easily one of the best metal album ever. Hail Manowar!
B000000WFU|5.0|The 'Adiemus' series of recordings began with this cd, issued in 1995, the product of a collaboration between two ex-members of the legendary UK jazz-rock group Soft Machine -- Karl Jenkins and Mike Ratledge.  Having enjoyed this disc for several years now, I think it goes a long way in respectfully bridging gaps between Western culture as we know it and the soul of more unpolluted (some would say 'primitive', but I want to avoid any judgemental connotations that some might attach to this word) traditions.<br />As Jenkins states in the notes, 'Songs of sancturary is an extended choral-type work based on the European classical tradition, but where the vocal sound is more akin to &quot;ethnic&quot; or &quot;world&quot; music'.  He goes on to explain his intentions more thoroughly than I will quote here -- but nowhere in the notes does he claim to be producing a 'new ethnic music', nor make any attempt to write 'new' music in the traditions of any ethnic music.<br />This is where I think some folks are missing the point of this composition -- the texts sung on this disc, as Jenkins states, were written phonetically, to be sung in a strident voice, 'fortissimo and without vibratto...to sound &quot;tribal&quot;...'  The word 'sanctuary' in the title should be a clue, '...a place of refuge.  This music is somewhere to escape to', Jenkins points out, again in the notes.<br />On that level alone, this project would have to be considered a success.  Additionally, I would add that I think the ethnic influences and evocations are successful as well, and in a repectful, rather than exploitive way -- there is a soul-deep love of the music of the world at play here.  Jenkins and Ratledge (with the able assistance of the London Philharmonic and the incredibly beautiful voice of Miriam Stockley) have delivered a gift to their listeners -- one that entertains and transports us, at the same time honoring the spirit of musical forms that are at the center of our collective spirit, untainted by the demands of a commercial world.ainted by the demands of a commercial world.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is an album that is totally beyond comparison. To call it the best pop album ever is an understatement, and also a little misleading. This music is beyond categorization as &quot;pop&quot;-- it's simply brilliant, idiosyncratic MUSIC. That being said, there is nothing in the history of recorded music that even touches the sheer genius of this record. Every microsecond of sound is so carefully considered and perfectly arranged that the result is the most emotionally touching collection of songs you'll ever hear. It is impossible to overrate Pet Sounds. It is unlike anything that came before or after. Nothing in the Beatles' over-hyped catalog even comes close-- and anything that might be in the same general proximity is rightly credited more to George Martin's production than the &quot;Fab Four&quot;. Remember, Pet Sounds is the work of one singular musical imagination-- Brian uses the Boys as &quot;instruments&quot;-- composed, arranged, produced/assembled, dreamed as a coherent whole.<br />This album should be heard by EVERYONE, whatever you believe your musical to be. It is one of the great works of Western Civilization for us to study, consider and enjoy. Beyond essential.   <br />This version offers the original Mono mix as well as a new Stereo mix. Obviously,it should be heard in the original Mono to be fully appreciated, but I'll be the first to admit the Stereo is REALLY good, offering a sense of spaciousness and natural sound that is hard to criticize. It's not a substitute for the original, but a great addendum. Honestly, the best version is the DCC &quot;gold&quot; disc which is mastered with such attention to detail that it has an almost intangible like-like quality not even present on the original LP. But, I own about 7 different copies and versions of this album on various format, and this &quot;two-fer&quot; offeres excellent sound an value.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|Well, I have got to say that Moulin Rouge is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time.  I was not going to watch it but was persuaded to by my woman, Fiona! The story line, based on love, music, good and bad was all that it should have been - Fiona had her tissue out - she said that she had something in her eye, but I'm not so sure?  The film effects/camera work/use of perspective were excellent - you found that you were rapped up in the moment as you were whisked off into `dream happy land'.  The music as well, the use of songs and dance rhythms that you recognise, to enhance the story line, just excellent.  Go and see it.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie was so good, I went to see it twice - in single day!  The first twenty or so minutes were a little strange, but give it a chance and this film really sweeps you off your feet.  I was awed one moment, and just weeping the next.  It is a delight to watch, but it is also very heart-wrenching.  As in...I was afraid I was going to burst into sobs in the middle of the silent theater.  <br />Nothing plays on our emotions like music, and that's where this film shines (along with the visuals, which I'll get to later.).  The songs were very touching and haunting, and pleasant to listen to.  You know how you'll be watching some musical, and a song starts to come up, and you're like...*YAWN*.  That never happens in this film.  The songs are just beautiful.<br />To go along with the spectacular soundtrack is a visual feast for your eyes.  The film is just beautiful to watch.  The colors are dazzling, and the film's director wasn't afraid to give the film a surreal feel - when Satine and Christian kiss, fireworks burst in the background.  While this may not be realistic, it is very pretty and enjoyable to watch.  You'll never get tired of watching Moulin Rouge -- it is a thing of beauty.  You can watch countless sunsets and never get bored.  That's how Moulin Rouge is.<br />Nicole Kidman is absolutely beautiful as Satine, and she has a great voice.  Ewen McGreggor is great as Christian - he has a great voice, too.  <br />All in all, this is a rare gem of a movie that's wonderful to listen to (I bought the soundtrack and I love it), captivating to watch, and the plot sweeps you off your feet.  I loved it, and I'm sure you will, too.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have been a Tool fan for some time now and have read several of the reviews for this CD.  It seems the biggest complaint of most people is that the songs on the album are too long.  All I can say is that it is very sad that our generation cannot hold it's attention more than 3 minutes no matter how good a song is.  Another common complaint is that this CD does not live up to Aenima or Undertow.  I disagree, it is just as good as either CD, and perhaps better than both.  I think the real problem is not the CD but the listener.  I think most Tool fans expect way too much of Tool.  It's not easy being the best band around.  Most people's reviews read, &quot;Good, but not good for Tool.&quot;  So are you saying that it is only 4 times better than anything that will be released this year instead of 5 times better?  I remember when I first heard Aenima I thought it was good, but nowhere near as good as Undertow.  Although, after a few weeks of nonstop listening I soon understood just how good Aenima was.  Perhaps it will just take longer for this CD to sink in for some people.  And if your complaint is, &quot;I want this CD to be good now.&quot;  I think that is childish and lazy.  If you are not willing to listen to a CD a few dozen times before you can truly enjoy it, then take it back, it's not for you.  Go buy some pop CD that is full of radio friendly songs that sound good the first four times you hear them but never again.  Then go buy another pop CD as soon as that one wears out (probably that same day).  But if you want a CD that will only keep getting better with each listen, try Lateralus.

0393312836|5.0|&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is not the book it seems to be.  People often speak of it and the Kubric film in a way that makes it a blatant disregard for human emotion; a chance to tantalize the senses and fill our minds with senseless violence, rape, and murder.  The antagonists of Mr. Burgess' classic tale fail to discover the meaning of this horrific novel, much the same as those who find the &quot;relations&quot; offending in &quot;Brave New World,&quot; and those who banned &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; for its language.<br />Censors miss true meanings of great literature because they are too busy dabbling over trite matters, while the big picture passes them by.  Fortunately for Alex, in 1986 Anthony Burgess was able to reissue the book with its 21st chapter, left out of the original American version and out of Stanley Kubric's film.  But even without Alex's remorse spelled out for the reader, one who pays attention can see that the novel is based strongly on the forces of good and evil and our glorious ability to choose.  When Alex's free-agency is taken away from him and he is reformed to be a law-abiding man, the novel asks boldly, &quot;Yes, but at what cost?&quot;  The brilliant language (nadsat) used by Alex and his droogies hints at the possibilites of his scenerios materializing in the future; in 30 years or tommorrow or 1,000 years.  Frankly, it doesn't matter.  The novel warns that any time a human's agency is stolen from them, it is the beginning of the downfall of governments, nations, and humanity.  Think &quot;Brave New World&quot; and soma, or the thought police in &quot;1984.&quot;  Had Alex's fate reached the masses, the same rejection of the treatment would have occured, leaving us with thankfulness for the way life is, and warning us about the way life could be.  Burgess captured brilliantly what the charlie tells the prison authorities, &quot;When a man looses his ability to choose, his ceases to be a man.&quot;<br />Very highly recommended...

B000005JA8|4.0|A landmark work by the Magic Band.  The music sounds like a desert with Beefheart's poetry the ghostly wind flying above.  Listen to this if you have had enough of people telling you what improvisation is, or should be.  I consider Trout Mask Replica as one of CB&amp;TMB's three best works: _Trout Mask Replica_, _Safe As Milk_, and _Mirror Man_ (get the new Mirror Man Sessions if you can, as it is very successfully remastered and includes the excellent &quot;Beetle Bones &amp; Smokin' Stones.&quot;)  The track &quot;Ella Guru&quot; is among my favorite Beefheart compositions, along with &quot;Moody Liz&quot; and &quot;Autumn's Child.&quot; <br />Get this album.
6300273199|5.0|Ende der 70er Jahre nach dem &quot;Highway To Hell&quot;-Album waren AC/DC mit Snger Bon Scott auf dem Hhepunkt Ihrer Karriere. Nicht zufllig wurde dieses Konzert in Paris aufgenommen. Schon damals waren die Franzosen die grten AC/DC-Fans in Europa. Zu einer zeit als in den USA AC/DC noch im Vorprogramm der populrsten amerikanischen Bans spielten, waren sie in Europa schon ein Top Act. Das Video &quot;let There Be Rock&quot; enthlt die strksten Live-Nummern die AC/Dc jemals gespielt haben (Live Wire, Whole Lotta Rosie, The Jack,..). Leider sind die Aufnahmen etwas dunkel und der Sound auch nicht berragend. Doch wer den charismatischen Snger Bon Scott damals nicht live erlebt hat, muss sich unbedingt dieses Video zulegen. Bon Scott war DIE Stimme von AC/DC. Einer der grten Rock'n'Roll-Snger aller Zeiten. Die ganze Band spielt mit einer Energie, die schier unglaublich ist. Keine Band jemals zuvor und keine Band danach hat Musik dermaen &quot;gearbeitet&quot;. Ein Mu fr jeden AC/DC-Fan und Rockliebhaber!

B000001DZQ|5.0|There is not much more I can say about this man that has not  been said already.  It's all true.  It's just frustrating that more people have not heard his music.  The track &quot;Down by the river&quot; alone is worth buying this 2 disk compilation. You will see what I mean.  I have listened to many guitarists, and none of the played with the same emotional intensity as Roy did. Stevie Ray Vaughan came every close. The signature of a great guitarist is what he can convey with just one note. Roy left us with that note and we will never be the same. Buy this CD, you won't regret it.
0618135871|4.0|I view this novella as a breath between the major works Roth has been producing routinely for the past several years, and a welcome one at that. Is Kepesh reprehensible? Of course he is, and that's precisely the point. And whether you view the book as misogynistic is BESIDES the point, like it or not. Any capable reader would be wise not to equate Kepesh's character with Roth--even if resemblances to &quot;real life&quot; may occur here and there. Roth could easily become more &quot;politically correct&quot; to woo and coax the Noble Prize bigwigs, but he doesn't, and that to me strengthens his reputation as a writer. And for the person who made the mistake of identifying Roth as the author of the BENNY PODA YEARS: how could you possibly mistake this as a work of Roth's? Please!

B000002MM8|3.0|I enjoyed Aion, an earlier Dead Can Dance album, so I decided to try this one as well. Though I expected a stylistic change, I wasn't sure whether it would be for the better of the worse. It turned out to be mostly for the worse. On Aion, Brendan Perry was the lead singer on only one track. Here, he does four, and I don't like them. \\"How Fortunate the Man With None\\" is okay, but the rest sound almost like pop songs, which isn't what I wanted from this CD. The other songs are all sung by Lisa Gerrard, who is a much better singer, and there are a few really good ones, such as \\"Emmeleia.\\" (Brendan Perry is also one many of these, but he doesn't have the same problems as a backup singer.) Unfortunately, many of them are too synth-heavy for my taste, and DCD isn't as convincing when playing this Middle Eastern-influenced music as they were playing European early music. I won't sell this CD, but it has discouraged me from buying any more Dead Can Dance albums.
078401213X|5.0|I thought Pi was a great movie and everybody that suffers migraines should watch it. Also, I really like Jackie Chan movies.
0553106635|5.0|This book was not the usual dragging on of day to day events just to fill up pages that I am used to seeing in these little cliff hangers. It was the best of all three. I was shocked and surprised by the turn of events, when I'm used to knowing what is going to happen chapters before it does. I can't wait for the next book. I just hope he doesn't drag it on until I'm sick of it like Robert Jordan has with his Wheel of Time series.
B00003CXRM|3.0|Having seen clips of this film I had to rent it as soon as it came out on DVD. Sadly I was disappointed.  The acting was great - I didn't know George Clooney could look so unattractive(!) -  but the storyline was thin and slow moving. My greatest memory of the film was the song 'I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow' - both performances (although lip-synched) are gems and about the funniest parts of the whole film.
B000056K04|4.0|OK, I can see why people are giving bad reviews to this album. I also think that any of DMB's other albums are better than this one, but really this album isn't as bad as everyone says. It certainly is very different, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. Most of Dave Matthews' fans expect him to always make the exact same music. When he does something different, they automatically reject it. I think we should allow the band to evolve and change with time. A band that isn't always the same usually makes the best music. Just look at the Beatles!<br />I'll admit that the first time I heard this album, I wasn't a big fan of it either. But the more I listened to it, the more I grew to like it. I had the same experience when I first heard &quot;Don't Drink The Water,&quot; &quot;Halloween,&quot; and &quot;Drive In Drive Out.&quot; I liked Everyday's songs even more when I heard them live in concert. It gave them new depth and made them much more enjoyable. Since I've heard them performed live, I've found that I want to listen to this album more and more. <br />This album also sounds better when you look at it in context with DMB's unreleased album, The Lillywhite Sessions. These two albums are so completely different, that they actually compliment each other very well. I keep one album in my car and the other in my house, so I can listen to the two different sides of the band's music at the same time. Everyday is upbeat and poppy, whereas The Lillywhite Sessions are more introverted and dark. They are both great albums and show how dynamic the band is. <br />If you've listened to this album and weren't sure you liked it, I urge you to give it another chance. If you just listen to it a few times, I think you'll be surprised by how it grows on you.
0385501560|5.0|Having read all other books by the author,I was greatly pleased to see and read that he onve again has brought another tale of warped human pysche and woe. From the under-devolped, mishapened chickens to the building to nowhere for nothing,Palahniuk seems to take modern nihilism and satire as well as a bit of deconstructonsim to dizzying heights before leaving as all with his trademark what in the Hell was that ending. Truly he has become one of America's best authors.
B000059XUP|5.0|Because I saw City of Angels before I was the first installment made it better. I had nothing to compare it to and therefore I loved it. It doesn't deserve anything lower than a 3.
B000002UAU|5.0|99and 9/10's % of the music buying public love this album, and 1/10 % do not... Pepper was dynamite in 67, was great in 87, and is still stupendous in 2001! Enough said.
B0000060NF|5.0|This album was way ahead of its time.  [IMO] this is the greatest LP ever recorded.  I really have nothing else to say.
B000002I2M|5.0|&quot;LA Woman&quot; is my favourite Doors album and it is EXCELLENT. Jims lyrics are, as always, mystical, potent and self reflective. The often over looked talents of Robbie Kriegers guitar and Ray Manzericks keyboard mastery, along with the solid backing of John Densmore on drums jam pack this album with classic Doors greats.<br />It starts with &quot;The Changeling&quot;, an excellent opening song of Jims energised voice as he sings &quot;I'm a changeling, see me change...&quot; &quot;Love Her Madly&quot; is a teriffic and catchy rock tune, showing Rays panache on the keyboard and the bands awesome combined sound. &quot;Been Down So Long&quot; is a great, grindy, gruff song, with a typical bluesy feel. &quot;Cars Hiss By My Window&quot; is close to my favourite track on the CD (if it weren't for &quot;LA Woman&quot;), as we see another simple bluesy song, with dynamite lyrics and Jims growling, instrumentesque voice at the end taking the song out. This leads on to my favourite track, not only of the CD, but of all Doors songs, &quot;LA Woman&quot; where Jim compares LA to a woman. The whole song is brilliant, with Krieger shining in his awesome guitar opening twang that sets the song running and in his solo display. All band members in this song play an intergral part of making this song the classic it is, as &quot;Mr Mojo Rising&quot; settles down the songs frantic pace and then brings up again; a rock classic! &quot;L'America&quot; is a spooky sounding song and the most unusual on the album, but it fits, as do all the songs in the order they play. It is like a halfway point in the energy of the album. &quot;Hyacinth House&quot; is another favourite, where the band sounds awesome playing the melody together and feeding of Jims deep toned, bluesy lyrics as he sings &quot;..why did you throw the jack of hearts away? It was the only card in the deck that I had left to play..&quot; This song shows the diverse talents of all band members and how well they sounded when they were gelling. &quot;Cawling King Snake&quot; and &quot;The Wasp (Texas Radio And The Big Beat)&quot; are also great tracks that continue the blues influence evident throughout the album. It is only fitting that the album finishes with the legendary &quot;Riders On The Storm&quot; as Ray magically invites you in amidst the sample of rainfall and thunder as Jim croons the ever famous lyrics; an unforgetable song!<br />This album as a whole is masterful and produced brilliantly, evident by the changing of the sound of Jims voice on the tracks and his sampled voice in the background. It is a fitting finale to one of the greatest and most infamous bands of all time. The &quot;Lizard King&quot; ended on a high. A must have album!
B0000524E5|5.0|This is a great movie, for anyone to watch.  Guys will love it for obvious reasons.  I mean there are half naked, beautiful girls dancing on a bar, at times with wet t-shirts.  Anything with beautiful women will be a moovie that attracts men, and Coyote Ugly easily fits that description.  This is also a movie that many women I know love.  They are attracted to the romance of this movie.  The main character, an aspiring musician, moves to New York in hopes of getting her big break, falls in love, and I would consider this kinda a love story.  No matter who you are, I believe this is a great choice, and youll love this movie.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album shows how truly talented Radiohead are and how much more they are concerned about their own musical development. OKC was a work of art and so is Kid A, but in a different way. Radiohead are pushing the boundaries and evolving with modern trends, mainly electronica.<br />Electronica in many forms plays a large role on this album; whether it be jungle, ambient or trippy, the use of electronic influence makes this album unique and appealing. Radiohead incorporate samples, distortion and mixing along with their usual, excellent guitar, keyboard, bass and drums.<br />From the opening track &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; it is obvious that this is not going to be an OKC repeat, as the keyboard pounds, samples flare and Thoms eloquent voice gives this song a spacey feel, where no guitars are present. &quot;Kid A&quot; continues the electric feel, with its distorted, uncomprehensible voiceover lyrics, jungly beat and spacey samples. &quot;The National Anthem&quot; is a crazy song, with classic guitar riffs and drum thumps throughout, meshed with trippy overplaying samples of an orchestra warming up. A sudden influx of horns 3 mins in creates sound fused craziness, ending in a blare of horns and instruments at once. &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot; has a more conventional Radiohead feel to it with soft sounds complimenting Thoms voice. &quot;Treefingers&quot; is a chilled, ambient instrumental, while &quot;Optimistic&quot; has great lyrics and &quot;In Limbo&quot; a great sound.<br />&quot;Idioteque&quot;, my favourite track on the album is brilliant with its jungly beat, electronic mix and strong lyrics. &quot;Morning Bell&quot; is also another winner with its smooth sound and Thoms amazing voice. The final track &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;  has excellent electronic effects on top of a great melody. A variety of intruments including strings and harps are evident here as the song ends, only after you've sat through a minute of silence,with evaporating electronic simplicity.<br />I can understand why so many people do not like the direction Radiohead have gone with this album, and I would recommend you listen before you buy. Some of Thoms lyrics are impossible to understand, but that is part of the general feel of the album. &quot;Kid A&quot; is a big and daring step into the new and unknown realm of electronic fused alternate music. It displays Radioheads talent, their broadmindedness and musical appreciation for many a genre.<br />I bought it without hesitation and enjoyed its uniqueness and difference from the first listen. It is complex and layered and that grows on you as you realise how great a band these guys really are...
0380973650|5.0|It all seems so simple:A man gets out of prison, only to find out that the one ray of hope that's kept him going is not going to be there when he gets out. But simple this story ain't! This book is a journey through America through the eyes of Neil Gaiman:The Master who gave us The Sandman. When reading this book, keep this in mind:Don't let any detail pass you by. Things have a way of relating to each other as the story progresses. I'm going to leave it at that, because to say any more would spoil the surprise...
B000000WA4|5.0|I have one question to ask all of the reviewers out there: Why only 4.5 stars? This is clearly a landmark album, with the art to match meeting such melancholy needs. The album artwork is almost as 'psychodelic' as The Frogs' first album with the two cats eating watermelon on a porch. And the music, whooaho...dont even go there, man. It will absolutely, positively, without a doubt, BLOW YOU AWAY. Okay, to the review.<br />If you haven't noticed already by my other reviews, I am a straight-forward pumpkinhead. I love the pumpkins, and my love for them grows along with all of their music. This, in fact, was my first Pumpkins CD, and I had to scramble all my $2 bills up and my $15 on-cue gift certificate to buy this piece of artwork. The night before, a fellow friend/person i know was driving around in his car with his subs to the max, listening to the Pumpkins (Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness). He told me who he was listening to, and the next day i got to go to on-cue. I bought Mellon Collie at first sight, and I knew I made the right choice, because when the store clerk saw me coming at 10 feet away with the MELLON COLLIE AND THE INFINITE SADNESS double disc in my hand for $24.95 he quickly started mumbling &quot;oh yeah...&quot; and I came to the counter and he said &quot;Ahh...yeah. Good choice you won't regret it. I bought mine the day it came out and to this day I listen to it at least once a week.&quot; And my father was standing there and said &quot;So this is a good choice for my son, huh?&quot; and he quickly replied with &quot;definately.&quot; Obviously, the guy didn't lie, and I love this cd so much. I want to thank the guy who ran that little barcode across the scanner for me, and for the Pumpkins for their continued work (most people think they stopped, but they continue with bootlegs). I love these guys, and you should too. Although I did find a better cd, called &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, this is still in my top collection. And if you haven't guessed already, Siamese Dream is a Pumpkins album...of course! I'm gonna buy an extra Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness and Siamese Dream and put them in plaques. Coming straight from a music lover and Pumpkinhead all together, I leave you with these words:<br />As far as you take me, that's where I believe; The realm of soft delusions, floating on the leaves...-Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans.   BRILLIANT LYRICS FROM A BRILLIANT LYRICIST. BILLY CORGAN WHOM I KNOW AND LOVE. THANK YOU BILLY.
0446310786|5.0|With all the reviews for this book, another surely isn't needed.  But if you've never seen the movie version, you definitely won't be disappointed.
630575067X|5.0|I am fed up with all of these cumudgeon reviews about the Phantom Menace.  Although it has its share of flaws.  No Real Comedy, and Cheesy Dialogue.  It does not sink the spectacular scope and vision of the movie itself.  The characters were underdeveloped with the intention of making an action movie...It is not supposed to have Academy Award Winning Acting.  There is an overabundance of Special Effects of Everything else is perfect.  And the Actors Do Convince.  Maybe with more moroseness and less Jar-Jar, Lucas's Vision of his Series will come into full fruition.  I do agree that Lucas needs to hold his shots though.  He needs to let the audience care about the actors. Still a great movie though
B00004U2HK|5.0|I can't understand how anyone could ever dislike this movie. I admit that it can be quite the spoonful of sugar to take, but you still can't walk away feeling bad. I get chills the moment that the film opens. Having visited Salzburg (and yes I did take the SOM tour) it's as beautiful today as it ever was. Of course there are mistakes; for example the opening scene is not shot on the top of the Untersburg, but on the next mountain over and at the end the family is actually walking towards Germany instead of away, but who cares. It's beautifully filmed. The music is incredible and uplifting. The story is cute. The characters and enjoyable. It's one of those perfect films.
0684853523|3.0|This is the first book by Stephen King I have read and I have to admit I am disappointed.<br />On Writing is written as two books: an autobiography and a writing primer.  The autobiographical information was interesting and helped explain the latter.  On the writing side, I came away felling I might have been better off if I had read The Elements of Style, King's favorite Style book.<br />His sections on description, dialogue, narration and editing earned the book my three star rating.  The examples cited and King's commentaries were great.<br />I guess I expected more from such a prolific writer.  The book's fault probably lies more in my expectations, than King's ability to communicate.
6305313687|5.0|Well lets see its very rare for me to use five stars, but American History X deserves many more.  In my personal opinion it was the best movie of the year in 98, but of course would not have won due to the subject matter....its not politically correct.  Thats is why I like it so much.  It tells the story of hate and racisim like it truly is.  It doesnt potray the skin heads as low rent, uneducated rednecks, nor does it potray them as heros, but potray them as confused frustrated youth. EDWARD NORTON.......MY GOD! he was incredible...should had gotten best actor for this film.  Edward Furlong also was extremely good.  the director did a amazing job in keeping the story together.  He doesnt lose the audience in the flashbacks.  THere is so much to say about this movie.....so ill sum it up by saying ........BUY IT!  WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN! BUT BE SURE NOT TO PUT YOUR MOUTH ON THE CURB
6305558167|5.0|I'm a fan of the middle ages and fantasy alike. I've read lots of books when it comes to King Arthur and this movie stays true to the legends for the most part.It is an older movie but its better than any other Arthur based movies.
0553573403|5.0|Simple:  Buy it -- it's great and the sequels won't let you down. Adventure, action, intrigue, great characters, &amp; a plot that twists and turns.
B000021XS0|5.0|Well, I bought Scenes a time ago, signed by guitarist John Petrucci. I gave it away to a good friend of mine (the biggest mistake I ever made!!!). Recently I purchased it again and the first time I listened to it again, I became a sort of addicted to this album. It's almost unbelievable how a piece of music can get such things done.... It's the best album I ever bought (and I bought a lot) and the only one I listened to in about a week.<br />In one word: impressive
B00005ASOC|5.0|I saw the movie while on vacation and found myself there...watching it instead of anything else. I dont' usually enjoy what's on TV that much. But this video was GOOD. The writing was what I could have reviewed in a film class, as the director said VOLUMES to me. It unraveled slowly and with predictability but that didn't take away from anything. The movie was great
B000002L9J|5.0|This is EPIC! 'I Know It's Over' is in my opinion the lifebelt of the whole album. The Smiths were right up there in genius with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones but our blind media wont give them credit until something bad happens to our dear Morrissey. Life is certanly grim when fine music like this doesnt get to the masses. Morrissey, Marr, Any and Mike, Thank U for this album that has gotten me through many times of need.
B00005BJC7|5.0|I'm not so sure. The Kid A album was brilliant. This, what is this? I'll tell you what, (I'm not a Radiohead fan) the album is 3/4 of Kid A. Track reaction: Packt - First of all, it has to be heard on the CD itself to really be heard, it's a nice star-off with decent lyrics.         Pyramid - Ooh! Sounds pretty? Yes. No. Maybe. You decide. One verse for five minutes. It's not a favorite (it became a single)  Pulk/Pull - This is a track about doors! It's REALLY ABOUT SOMETHING YOU CAN THINK ABOUT! Haunting, Cool! One of the best!                                                       Whose army? - This song is good. Seeps its way right into the shallow depths of the album.                                   Be Wrong - A repeated theme in the music. I like it. Good lyrics.           Knives Out - Pretty worthless. Very forgetable, sort of. The lyrics depict the violence while the music makes a bit of sad/matter-of-fact tone to it. Comes in handy though.                                                  Amnesiac/Morning Bell - IOW morning bell is back and SHORTER! What a shame, the song needs its original length to work well. The music doesn't depict much imagry like in the last version. The track was a mistake (but who am I to say)                                                       Dollars &amp; Cents - Get lost in the babbling from an angry whiney voiced vocalist (only angry in this song as far as I know) and get your soul cracked. It goes somwhere at least!             Hunting Bears - I don't think it was meant for us. It's probably a personal joke.                                             Spinning Plates - A good track. Not really a song.               In a Glasshouse - The last track on this album really ends the album well. Kid A's last track was good but not as good as this one. This one has good everything. It makes you feel like you really listened to a good album (it's not that good)             The best part of  the album is the little book. If the album leaves you hungry for more, get the book and see all the junk it says. Discover hidden messages. Blah blah blah. The album isn't perfect and the book makes up for it.
0553573403|5.0|This was an exceptional book.  I picked it up thinking  I was merely starting on another mediocre book, but this passed my highest expectations.  A Game of Thrones is so interesting and complex that it is destined to be a classic, at least in the world of fantasy. To say that he is following in Tolkien's wake would be absurd, since they are so different, but Martin was definitely able to bring me in and hold me like few authors have done before.  The characters well amazingly well played out, and so coldly realistic. The plot was cool, and had massive amounts of twists and turns that just made this book enjoyable.  Though there really wasn't even any fighting or real action for quite a while(except for about the 2nd page, but that was rather mysterious) I was never left bored or lost in this book. Just wanting to know the next careful step to be made by one of the high lords, or what was going to happen to Stark children was enough to keep me reading. One thing I liked about his writing was that each chapter discussed a separate person, so I had to keep track of all the different sub-plots going on at the same time. Yes, he sometimes didn't get back to a particular character as much as I would have liked, but I certainly liked it better than having many subsequent chapters on one person in particular.  A Game of Thrones is not to be taken up with a light heart or queasy stomach though. He tells the story so graphically and  with such insensitivity that at times it was rather disturbing, but he was able to accurately portray good and evil(well, at least evil, I don't think there was really any pure good in this book) in their rawest forms.  He didn't have basic fairy-tale characters, he had realistic and amazing people, as well as history that was believable and such, but only because of his delivery of everything was so accurate to what life can be like.  Martin is most assuredly an impressive writer and I am hoping the following books are as good as th
B00003CX5P|5.0|In the beginning, George Lucas was transferring all his Star Wars movies on VHS. The special editions of Episodes IV,V,&amp; VI, are understandable for DVD technology was just developing and wasn't being taken full advantage of. But when Episode I: The Phantom Menace came into theaters, then onto VHS the DVD format was available for quite some time, and according to the digital video revolution, the picture, sound, and details were outstanding. But why did George decide to release Episode I now. What was his reason for not doing it when it came out. I was at Winamp.com recently and there was a comment about Episode I not being on DVD at the time. But that's a good question. But with the DVD release on Oct. 16, 2001, there will be deleted scenes, tons of extras and commentary, possibly on what the story or ideas where when he began writing Episode II. And since Lucas Ltd, only has a little over a year before the second film is released why not reveal what the next title will be to the public. But I have to say one thing DVD rocks! And so does the Star Wars series!
B000002HRE|3.0|Reload has its moments, although I think it is unfair to compare it to previous albums.  By itself, Reload is a good rock-and-roll album with highs and lows.  I don't consider Reload a metal album because most of the songs could be played on the radio and are relatively short.  The highs are on such songs as &quot;The Memory Remains&quot;, &quot;Fixxxer&quot;, and &quot;Unforgiven II&quot; with interesting guitar work and lyrics.  The lows (unfortunately more of these) are on songs like &quot;Slither&quot;, &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, and &quot;Bad Seed&quot;.  These songs are repetitive, unimaginative, and for the first time in my Metallica listening career...annoying.  This album is Metallica's most commercial by far. All artists have a right to express themselves through their medium however they choose, but for the sake of Metallifans everywhere I hope the next album has heavier riffs, perhaps an insturmental, and some guitar solos!!!
B000001ZS4|5.0|I consider this album to be the best album ever. Yes, I'm a JMJ fan, so of course I say it is the best, but no matter what, it is the best.<br />The first rewiew of this album was written by Felix Matahias. He claims that JMJ was not the person who invented the electronic music. Felix claims that Claus Schulze already had done an electronic album 1976. Yes, and JMJ did his Oxygene 1976 and it was the FIRST album with ONLY electronic musci. Maybe Claus Schulze had drums or anything else non-electronic instrument incorparated in his album? To mention that Oxygene JMJ did as the first electronic album, he had done three other albums before that, &quot;La Cage&quot;, &quot;Les Granges Brulees&quot; and &quot;Deserted Palace&quot; wich is only electronic music, and Deserted Palace was created by him in the beginnig of the 70's. So JMJ did not create the electronic instruments, but he created the electronic music.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I was waiting in anticipation for this movie to come out and was one of the first in the world to see it. But sadly within 10 minutes into the film I was horribly saddened to see that Lucas has turned this film into a childrens movie. Something that should be seen on Disney. Horrible characters, just plain horrible. Ruined the film completely. Jar-Jar Binks was the worst. Just to hear the name sends me into a state of depression. I sure hope for his next film he rethinks how he is going to display his characters.There was no sence of deepness to this film. A five year old child could tell me what everything meant and what the end result would be. Bad. Bad. Bad. I would have rated this film zero stars but I must admit the effects were rather nice. So one star it is.
0060174900|5.0|I read The Bell Jar several times during my emotionally troubled high school &amp; early college years, which led me to want to (and, in fact, read all of Plath's poetry and become a Sylvia Plath fan.  Twenty-plus years after my first reading, I found myself wallowing in depression, trying to make sense of it all, with a hankering to revisit The Bell Jar.  It was even better the second (well, actually fourth or fifth) time around -- not only could I relate to Esther Greenwood's horrid isolation, I could also see the humor and wit this time, and relate not only to Esther's personal desperation, but also her mother's desperation to ensure that she was okay and her inability to do so.  Esther stews over / tinkers with / attempts suicide in a variety of ways, underscoring the chronic nature of depression.  Oddly, reading The Bell Jar didn't bring me down at all -- rather, it made me think about how gripping depression can be if one never confronts it head-on and conquers it (assuming such is possible).
0312932081|5.0|This novel is one of the most intriguing examinations of the use of military force and its ethical ramifications.  What is the appropriate level violence to apply to one's enemies?  Is OK to manipulate your own soldiers for the good of the people? The SF plot of the novel allows Card to use the canvass of an intergalactic ware to tell his tale.<br />Beyond that, Ender makes for a fascinating character.  The boy genius is a tortured, sympathetic hero like no other.  Upon conclusion of the novel I rushed out and purchased Speaker For the Dead to follow Ender's further adventures.<br />Often categorized as &quot;young adult,&quot; this is a wonderful read for any age.

0380788624|5.0|If you're interested in computing, cryptography, World War II, freedom of information, with a whiff of conspiracy theory, this is a superb vehicle to reading enjoyment.<br />It is very slightly less \\"savagely\\" witty than some of Stephenson's earlier works [Interface and Cobweb leap to mind], but certainly carries on with the common features of:<br />- Sympathy towards the \\"technically knowledgeable\\"; <br />- At some point, dangerously byzantine political \\"stuff\\" happens;<BR> <BR>- An largely American perspective on the world tempered with two indirections, on the one hand, recognizing that there are a truly unfortunate number of American bigots, and on the other protagonists that somewhat understand and are sympathetic to foreign cultures; <br />- A fair bit of nearly \\"over the top\\" savage wit;<br />- Protagonists that are not so sweetly nice that the reader is expected to blindly cheer for them.

B00003CXRM|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but.....I thought it was meaningless and boring. Maybe that was the attraction...movies like this allow people to feel smart! I felt like the Coens were testing my &quot;coolness&quot; factor!<br />The peripheral characters were there for what reason? To take up time? Must have been, because they had absolutely no impact or relationship to the action of the movie. Their presence was totally random.<br />I thought that the entire film made fun of the South and Southerners (and no, I am not one). And what was the point of the cow being hit by a car? That was cruel and thoughtless. Did they think it was funny?<br />The sepia cinematography was gorgeous. That is the best thing I can say about this movie.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------
B000000JO3|5.0|along with bad brains and mudhoney, minor threat was the greatest punk/harcore band of the 80's. ian mckaye was (and still is), a genius of words, and a shaman of pure unadultured anger. these 26 songs are all excellent.<br />minor threat were not about image, although mckaye is perhaps one of the most recognizable advocators of, 'straight edge,' culture, something i don't agree with. that said, there is only one song on the album that blatantly boasts straight edge philosophy (the song is of that name). it's a bloody terrific song, however, but really offensive towards drug-users.<br />believe me, if you don't like fugazi (which is understandable), minor threat will change your mind about the brilliance mckaye and co. were capable of. truly a masterpiece

B000002U9W|5.0|'atom heart mother,' is really hard to talk about as an album, since it is a very complex, 'entity.' the album almost has a life of it's own, and the more you listen to it, the more you uncover hidden secrets. i guess i'll break it down song by song.<br />1. 'atom heart mother suite.' - i wonder what the band was on when they wrote and recorded this song, since no sober mind could have created such a monster, such a masterpiece of classical psychedelia. this song expands a period of 23 minutes but it never gets dull or clumsy. it's consistently beautiful. 'atom hear mother,' is broken down into six different sections, each one very different. from gorgeous, to funky, to sad, and then to the plain bizarre (their use of tape loops is especially interesting). the band also expands their horizons with a horn section and a choir. this song really has to be heard to be believed. it saves lives.<br />2. 'if' - this is just a pretty, folky little number from roger waters. it's a nice followup to the epic.<br />3. 'summer '68' - a strange, searching (yet fun) song from the wright files. <br />4. 'fat old sun' - this is an amazing song. it starts out as a folk song, but evolves into a rocker, finishing with a long, liquid guitar solo from david gilmour. just an amazing song.<br />5. 'alan's psychedelic breakfast,' yet another piece (you can't really call it a song), that is in segments. it's interesting, but not easy to listen to at first. it switches from tape loops of a person mumbling while he is making breakfast to wierd (and repetitive) interludes of piano and guitar. then, near the end, it all builds of to an absolutely glorious finale. it's worth listening to, since, like the first song, you pick up more hidden bits the more you listen to it.
B00001R3GR|5.0|If you want to start listening to R.E.M. you should probably start with Out Of Time, but Document stands as the best ROCK  album the band has done (read: not including Automatic For The People). &quot;It's The End Of The World...&quot; has an unresistable groove to it, while &quot;The One I Love&quot; and &quot;King Of Birds&quot; show a bit more sentimental side of the band. The anthemic &quot;Finest Worksong&quot; and the horn-ridden &quot;Exhuming McCarthy&quot; are also spectacular. Plus, have any of you noticed how much &quot;Lightning Hopkins&quot; resembles the style of the present-day Red hot Chili Peppers !?! Who's plagiating who, then? But the most notable change are the lyrics, which have taken a much more political features on this album, due to the Reagan era depression. There aren't really a weak song on this album, so in the end this rates as one of the finest records of it's decade and it's makers.
B000002KIE|3.0|i don't know why so many people refer to this as the greatest punk album of all time. the sex pistols were by no means a great band, but their influence is more impressive than they were. this album is a testament to bad taste, and when it works, it's nothing less than stunning. unfortunately, those moments are not very many.     <br />to start with, there are basically five great songs on, 'never mind the bollocks.' 'holiday in the sun,' 'bodies,' 'god save the queen,' 'anarchy in the uk,' and, 'pretty vacant.' for these songs it is worth to buy the cd. but then there is a very large downside; this album has way too much filler. almost all the songs besides the five mentioned are bloody awful, with poor drumming,  muddled singing, and boring guitars. the ideas are revolutionary, but the actual music is weak and pointless.<br />so go ahead. buy the album, but besides the few terrific songs, prepare to be disappointed. i suggest listening to the ramones instead.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie is not for everyone,not everyone will like it. I know I didn&#8217;t&#8230;. I LOVED IT!!!! It was a wonderfull combination of a love story and musical. There is certianly no movie like it before it!!!  The best musical I&#8217;ve ever seen before. With interesting camera work. Interesting remakes of song esp. the re-singing of Madonna&#8217;s &#8220;Like a Virgin&#8221; it is hilarious!!! This movie is not only truly funny, but a moving tale of a hooker and a poor Englishman(Ewan McGregor) who moves to france in hopes of producing musicals.  Then he meets Satine(Nicole Kidman)who he immediately falls in love with. Bad choice for a lover in my opinion, but it only adds to the thick and wild tale. The thing I love most about it is how Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman display true emotions that you really feel. Not only in just the acting, but in the music. It almost brings me to tears thinking of  Ewan singing to Nicole on the roof of her elephant shaped house. When you see it you&#8217;ll know. Its amazing.  To sum things up if you are looking for something different, a powerfull love story, a unique film, something hilarious yet serious, or just something amazing see this movie. But see it with an open mind. But remember this movie is not for everyone.  HOPE you love the film as much as I did I can&#8217;t wait to see it again!!!<br />...
B00003CXN4|1.0|I enjoy almost all movie's, but this one was extremely hard to watch.  What I was really thinking was what a waste of 3.00 to rent the movie.  The movie had no plot and was boring, I watched half the movie and had to turn it off.
0345350499|3.0|When I first got this book as a gift I had heard that it was wonderful.  But it just didn't live up to my expectations.  I expected a novel of Arthurian times form the point of view of the women, but I expected STRONG female characters.  Both of the main characters-Morgaine and Guinevier (forgive my spelling) have their moments true, but on the whole they are whinny and annoying and not all that powerful or strong.  Guinevier is a meek overly pious Christian who is a creature of the priests and overly self-doubtful and self-reproachful.  She never tries to fight her fate and gets very annoying after a while.  Morgaine is a little better but she never strives to find out the motives of Viviane never questions &quot;the will of the Goddess&quot; and when she finally does it's too late!  She becomes annoying too, always whining that she is &quot;little and ugly.&quot;  This is definitely NOT a great Arthurian novel- if you want different points of view read Courtway Jones's trilogy (In the Shadow of the Oak King, Witch of the North and A Prince in Camelot.)  The Once and Future King by T. H. White is a classic; all of these books are good retelling of Arthurian legend.  Marion Zimmer Bradley would have done better to tell a &quot;might have been&quot; tale or change the legend, as she obviously wanted to do.  At many parts I thought I would throw the book in frustration, she wrote so you WANTED something to happen, but then doesn't make it happen! As in all things you must decide for yourself, but personally I would say just don't bother.  It's too long to waste so much time on.
B00005KHJV|5.0|If you want to watch the scariest movie you'll ever see this would be it.  This was Wes Craven first film and is based on a true story. Most people can't watch entire film due to graffic content and most video stores especially Blockbuster yanked it for that reason. Want to get scared? This movie will do it.

B00005IBGQ|1.0|After reading all of the effusive praise being flailed at young Rufus here at Amazon and elsewhere, I feel like I perhaps ought to register a dissenting opinion. I really don't think the disc is deserving of the adulation it's receiving, and I think listeners may be confusing the goals of the album with the actual finished product.  <br />Rufus is certainly making a play at genius here, but the results fall staggeringly short.   I realize that Wainwright is classically trained, but the songs seem discordant, with disharmonius arrangements and queasy melodies.  If  Wainwright intended to apply a more modern school of composition to traditional pop songs, the mix simply doesn't work.  I would recommend listening carefully to sound samples before snapping this one up.
B000001GXB|5.0|I must admit that I am somewhat biased,  as I bought this disc having already become a major Pollini fan.  However,  even compared to other offerings in his magnificent discography,  this is one of my favorite Pollini recordings.  Probably the most remarkable quality of his interpretation of these sonatas is the intellectual and emotional depth his technically impeccable pianism conveys-just listen to the final movement of op. 110 and you'll hear what I mean.  My personal favorite,  though,  is Pollini's Hammerklavier-it is a truly epic,  colossally powerful performance.  I am far from an expert in music or performance-I am basically a casual student listener-but even I know great pianism when I hear it.
B00000JY1X|4.0|The critics have been raving about this collection for almost two years now. Being a fan, I bought the entire set at once within a couple weeks of when it came out. I listened to it all at once and again and again and then wrote a review here that was pretty stupid. So I'm rewriting that one. <br />The first disc is by far the best of the lot. It's the most consistant and it has some of the best songs (I Don't Believe in the Sun, All My Little Words, The Luckiest Guy, etc). Looking back two years later, it's pretty much the only one I listen to now. <br />The reason why is that there are so many throw away songs between the really good songs that I find myself having to program my CD player to get the songs I want without the songs I don't like. An album's not supposed to be like that--I'm supposed to be able to put it in and press play and enjoy.<br />Now let's look at this album compared to the earlier Magnetic Fields stuff. It's more natural, meaning that the instruments sound like natural instruments on many of the songs where on his earlier work was largely really processed. Prehaps you'll like that, perhaps you won't; I was suprised to find that I didn't like it as much. Another point that I'm sure a lot of other people mention is that Stephin Merrit doesn't sing the whole thing. In comparison he sings all of Get Lost, Charm of the Highway Strip, etc and none of Wayward Bus/ Plastic Trees (Susan Anaway sung that). I think this was a good choice on his part, not because other people can sing his songs better (though I'm sure Stephin Merrit couldn't sing that high on \\"Luckiest Guy\\") but because 69 songs sung by one person would be bordering on painful.<br />My to-the-point review: If you take out the throw away songs and make this collection into one CD, then it'd be everything the critics are raving about. As it is, be prepared to program your CD player. If you're a newbie to the Magnetic Fields, I'd advise getting only the first CD or buying Charm of the Highway Strip, as it's very good and far more consistant.

086140324X|5.0|The Colour of Magic is a perfect introduction to the wizarding society of the Discworld.  Although Rincewind doesn't seem at first to be the most able tour guide - Lord knows he didn't volunteer or anything - he and Twoflower the Agatean tourist [the first of his kind - wonder why ;-)] stagger, stumble, and ricochet from one zany predicament to the next with the sort of chaos one soon comes to expect from Rincewind's life.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes high fantasy enough to poke fun at it with a magically enchanted pointed stick.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Some movies are only worth the price of rental.  Others are worth owning.  Billy Elliot is definitely worth owning.  It will leave you uplifted and reaching for the remote to replay scenes over again.   If you like the energy of Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, you'll find the dance sequences here equally breathtaking.   The story line is terrific and believable.  The entire cast is exceptional. The family's effort to survive a pivotal coal strike parallels Billy's struggle to get his macho coal-miner dad to understand his son's need to dance.  The scene where Billy dances this message into his dad's heart is not to be missed -- it's more eloquent and moving than any spoken word. And Billy is  a very likable hero -- rough-hewn and flawed himself, but a dancer who is fueled by dance as if it were &quot;electricity.&quot;   The whole movie is riveting and the last scene is a particular triumph for everyone who's ever struggled for a chance to prove that dreams can come true.  The DVD includes nice extra features about the making of the movie.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Here we have a musical epic, filled with wonderful acting, a touching love story, and tons of great contemporary songs that fit perfectly into the plot.  Nicole Kidman plays 'Satine,' the star or &quot;Sparkling Diamond&quot; of the Moulin Rouge, French for The Red Mill, a night club filled with debauchery and licentious patrons and performers.  Satine is a courtesan, a fancy word for a prostitute.  Ewan McGregor plays Christian, the penniless writer who inevitably falls in love with her. <br />The fate of the Moulin Rouge depends on a show, Spectacular Spectacular, that is being written by Christian and obviously being performed with Satine as the star.  She wants so badly to be a real actress on a real stage and in front of a real audience.  However, there is a catch;  she must fall in love with the Duke, who is providing the funding to transform the Moulin Rouge from a club into a theatre.  She must then put of the facade of being infatuated with the Duke while trysting with Christian, who has a relentless fascination with the notion of love. <br />The movie fantastically portrays the conversion of Satine's mentality of love for money to love for salvation.  Christian opens her up and makes her see that love is the only thing important in life.  Christian, at the same time, learns that with love comes jealousy and heartache.  He becomes cold and bitter, and loses his faith in it's power.  <br />I went into this movie expecting another run-of-the-mill musical farce, but ended up being moved beyond belief.  I really felt with the characters and sympathized with them.  And there is a scene with Nicole Kidman, where she tells her boss she is running away, that is so well acted it brings her character to a whole new level.  All supporting characters are excellent as well.  See this film, even if you are skeptical, for this is truly a great one.
B00000JPH5|5.0|This really is a wonderful movie, for kids and adults. I wish everyone who was even thinking of buying it could watch it once- it would make up their mind to buy it. I have watched this movie since I was about 3 or 4, and while it may be a little bit to 'scary' for wee little ones, it is the perfect combo of adventure and muppets to keep kids happy. I have this movie, and I love it. If you are thinking of buying it, I suggest you do, you won't be disappointed by it.
B000050XEI|3.0|As someone who's been waiting a long time for Enya to produce another album firmly in the same league as &quot;Watermark&quot;, I'm happy to say this is; it's the first album of hers I've bought since &quot;Watermark&quot;, and it's also one of the few new CD's I'll buy this year.  The music is really fine from end to end.<br />My gripe is that the running time is less than 35 minutes.  Every track is a suitable-for-any-airplay-format 3:35 (a few are shorter).  In an era when many, if not most, CD's run 60-70 minutes, I feel they should have labeled this an extended EP or included a coupon for the other half of it when that was released.  Being the length of an 80's vinyl album just makes it way too short for the price.<br />So, 4 1/2 - 5 stars for quality, 1 star for quantity.
0061020680|4.0|Death has already featured in the first three Discworld novels, but only as a minor character - at best, he merely boded, at worst, he got a bit annoyed at Rincewind for always managing to avoid dying by a hairsbreadth.  In Mort, however, Death is a major player, taking on an assistant by the name of [duh] Mort.  This and the other Death novels are not as gothic as one might think at first.  As an outsider, Death tries to understand the quirks and foibles of humanity, and only partially succeeds.  Such deep philosophy is unusual in a humorous novel, but the Death books on the whole pull it off well.

B000002HMH|1.0|Whether or not Metallica sold out is of no importance.  What is undeniable is that they have become very rich and all of that money seems to have dulled their creative edge.  They went from having a &quot;think for yourself&quot; mentality to letting the MTV-radio establishment do their thinking for them.  Let's admit it, they went from being trendsetters to trend followers.  If you don't belive me, ask yourself what was the big scene in early to mid 1996?  Why it was stuff like Bush, Hootie and the Blowfish, Green Day, Oasis, ad nauseum. (With emphasis on NAUSEUM.)  You would think that a band as talented as the one that made MASTER OF PUPPETS would at least be able to do something original, but instead they had to follow the proverbial bandwagon.<br />I am in complete agreement with those that say if Metallica would have done MASTER OF PUPPETS II, their well would have run dry.  But how creative is LOAD?  Not very.  The riffs and rhythm structures sound for the most part like they do on the BLACK ALBUM.  Only on LOAD, they sound simpler and less enthusiastic. And when you add boring, predictable guitar solos with merely adequate drumming and bass playing, it makes for an awful album.  Furthermore, The few moments that are &quot;original&quot; have been done before by better alternative musicians.  Everything on this album sounds recycled.  And when you're in the musical recycling business, you truly do not grow or mature.  So many critics mistake stagnation for growth and maturity, particularly for this album.  Quite simply, LOAD is not growth.  It is regression.<br />So what I'm left wondering is why so many of Metallica's &quot;real&quot; fans make excuses for this album.  If having to like something like this makes me a real fan,  then I am no longer interested.  I can understand that they wanted do something simpler, slower, and possibly not as heavy.  But what I have a problem with is why they went in the same direction as the bandwagon, and did it with no real heart in their music.  And that's precisely what they did.al heart in their music.   And that's precisely what they did.
B00004SCX6|3.0|firstly, this album sounds a lot more mature than her first one. the songs have more meaning, but she didn't write them except for the last one so... the album isn't too bad. The beats are pretty cool and a lot better than christina's and mandy moores efforts. the best songs are oops!..., when your eyes say it, but all the songs are listenable. It's not exactly a classic album though.
B00003CXN3|1.0|I fast forwared through most of this movie, I only rented it be-cause of all the hype. I enjoy most of the movies that I rent, but this one was so boring that I felt like I should've gotten my money back..!! The movie had to many plots, the color was hideous, and it dragged on forever,what a  WASTE OF TIME.
B00005B36H|4.0|(I would really give this 4.5 stars, but ...doesn't allow half stars, so oh well) I've been waiting for this CD for so long, but it was worth the wait. Lateralus is such a step from nima. Everything sounds absolutly huge. Monstrous guitars, amazing double bass, and complex basslines often give way to quiet, psychedelic interludes. Adding to the music, the CDs packaging is very interesting.
B00000425R|1.0|I purchased this CD when I was looking for an addition to my library in the Baroque section.  This music is an example of the very finest in Baroque composition and is well interpreted by St Martin in the Field.  Number one of the two CD's that I received was stolen along with my portable player.  I was so impressed by the music that I ordered another package even though it resulted in a duplicate of #2.  As I write this I am listening to the CD and can only be amazed by both the beauty of the music and the deliciously rich presentation by the orchestral strings.
0156528207|5.0|This is such a good book. I think all grown-ups should read it- It will make them forget the silly little world of business. I was almost ashamed when I read this book- I forgot all about how simple and easy it is to be a child, and how much more- I don't know sensible?- it is. and when they said all about numbers. Now I hope I won't ask-how old? and how much does his dad make?- when I'm told ab out someone. Well, now is my next mission- make my mom and dad read it!!!
B00004YKUY|5.0|They say life is a journey, not a destination. Life is full of changes and this is just another one. Steve Perry and Steve Smith are GREAT in their own right. They will both be missed as Journey members, but no doubt we will hear from them again in their own projects! Neal Schon could not have found two more talented musicians to move forward with his band. Buy the album, then go see them LIVE! (the &quot;real&quot; test of a band) I've been a Journey fan for almost 20 years and I was &quot;depressed&quot; to hear that Steve Perry and Steve Smith would not be a part of the current lineup. My attitude has changed! Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo have BLOWN ME AWAY in their LIVE shows! Steve has the voice and stage presence that will carry Journey to a new generation of fans. He doesn't sound anything like Steve Perry, so there is no point in comparing the two! He has his OWN sound and can sing all the classic Journey songs in a way that makes you forget these songs have been around for 20 years. Deen Castonovo is a phenomenal drummer and every bit as GREAT! as Steve Smith. The past is the past...Buy the album, you won't be disappointed!! In a way, I'm glad this album gets almost no airplay. It sure makes it easy for us TRUE Journey fans to get upfront tickets to see the most AWESOME rock and roll out in YEARS! I'm sure that will change in the future, though.
B00004XOWM|3.0|If someone bought Chocolate Starfish before they bought any other Limp Bizkit CD, they might be a little impressed.  However, once they listened to their other albums, they would realize that Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish are the same.  Fred Durst has absolutly nothing to say.  How many times can we listen to him yell about how he's going to &quot;let it all out now,&quot; or how that girl played him out?  It's getting very old.  The music on this CD is actually very good.  Wes Borland's playing is phenomenal, but Durst ruins this CD.  I'd love to give this a lower rating, but the music saves it, atleast for now.
B000002VMD|5.0|&quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack is one of the biggest selling albums from the 90's.The 6 cuts from Whitney are all masterpieces.I was shocked to find out She co-wrote &quot;Queen of the Night,&quot; along with Babyface.This has got to be one of the hardest rocking songs from Houston,and my favorite from the album.&quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot; is another great song not played on the radio.&quot;I will always Love you,&quot; written by Dolly Parton,is beutifull.This was Kevin Costner's favorite song,and his idea to have Whitney record the number for the soundtrack.The Kenny G/AAron Neville duet,&quot;Even if my heart would Break,&quot; is another great cut,but the real killer is &quot;Its Gonna Be A lovely Day,&quot; by (The S.O.U.L.S.Y.S.T.E.M.)A fantastic rap,early 90's,HipHop sound. After almost 10 years,&quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack is still fresh.It would be great if Costner and Houston got together again for &quot;The Bodyguard,Part2.&quot;Whitney's stlye has changed alot since the early 90's,and I think the record and Movie would be a huge hit.
B000003TA4|4.0|When I heard this album (about ten years too late...) I was both disappointed and amazed.  I mean, from the opening of teen spirit (one of the best songs ever recorded), you're lost in the music of it.  The rough sound.  All the way up until Polly...then the record takes a sad turn.  You'll probably want to skip this weak and somewhat sick number.  This is followed by the world's worst rendition of &quot;Get Together&quot;.  The next song is good, and is enjoyable until the last two songs, which are just not good songs in my opinion.  Over all, it's a good record.  It's not as lyrically complex or well-written as Pearl Jam's Ten, sometimes the lyrics are outright bad.  And unlike the Pearl Jam album, there are songs I would skip here, if only because the sound have been copied and stripped so much over the years.  The punk-style simplicity adds to both the &quot;unusual&quot; (as in at one time it was unusual) sound, and the weakness of the record.  The record is surrounded by brilliance in parts, which makes listening worthwhile, and the album is full of truly good songs.
6304712936|5.0|If you like opera and classical music, you'll love this film. I think from a historical viewpoint, this film also gives you a good sense of the living conditions and society in Mozart's time. The portrayals of the main characters were so rich, three-dimensional.  You really get to understand their psyche as well as their actions. The film is based on the stage play. I can't imagine how those complex opera scenes were done on a stage. The transfer to DVD seems to be without any problems.  It would be nice to have some &quot;extras&quot; but even so this is a DVD worth having.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I first heard the rumor about the Star Wars movies coming out on DVD about a week ago, and I got exited. That was until I saw only Episode I was coming out. What a dissapointment. The original films don't have a release date whatsoever. Whatever your feelings are towards Episode I, it should have come out the seme date as the originals.
0061020710|5.0|Pratchett's writing is in many ways similar to Adams' sly &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series in that it is full of philosophical wit and vivid imagination. Terry Pratchett writes books which have fly-by action and are so engrossing that at times I read for hours on end. Ever since I picked up this book (the first in the Discworld series) several months ago, I haven't been reading any of the books by my other favorite authors and have been concentrating on the Discworld series exclusively ever since. <br />Color of Magic tells the story of the cowardly Rincewind and his attempts to keep the foreign tourist Twoflower alive and out of trouble (to no avail). This book is great in that it truly showcases Pratchett's talent. If you're looking for a new comedy-fantasy series, then look no further. The Color of Magic is a terrific way to introduce yourself to the wonder that is Discworld.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is a great book. It's one of those four or five books I've read that changed my outlook on things. I have an ecological bend, and the eco-mythos really grabbed me.<br />That said, Dune is not a perfect book. Those who have criticized Herbert's style are correct. It's cliche, overwrought, overdone. <br />But that's not important.<br />What is important is the symbolic story, long though it may be, which takes the reader through a variety of fantastic settings and introduces he/she to a vibrant cast of characters. They're simple, with the exception of Paul, and that's good! This isn't drama. Herbert himself said the book was about ecology, primarily, and the dangers of thinking the environment is ours to control and manipulate. The Bene Gesseritt weave an intricate web, and it's torn to shreds by one act of disobedience. The political discourse has ingrained the idea that &quot;the tripod is the most unstable of governments&quot; (paraphrased) in my head forever. Look out, America.<br />The book reminds me of Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces. Paul is the hero, and he must grapple with the complexity of the concerns of a universe, like all of us. That universe has spawned numerous sequels, which I fear can never live up to the precedent of the original.<br />I try not to praise lightly. Nevertheless, I think Dune is one of the &quot;great&quot; science fiction novels. It's a marvelous story, and that, above all, is why so many millions have heralded Herbert's Dune as the masterpiece of science fiction that it is.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|I thought Moulin Rouge was a fantastic film, in large part because of its very inventive soundtrack.  Unfortunately, much of the brilliance of that soundtrack is burried under pop renditions which diminish the character of the original motion picture versions.  The tracks which most closely preserve the original presentation (&quot;Because We Can,&quot; &quot;Your Song,&quot; &quot;Elephant Love Medley,&quot; &quot;El Tango De Roxanne,&quot; and &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;) also inherit the movie's emotion and power. I wish the rest of the disc were as true to the original.
B00004LN16|4.0|I had not bought a Ac/DC record since &quot;the razors edge&quot;.I downloaded all of &quot;Ballbreaker&quot; but i diddnt like it mutch,I thought Ac/Dc was a thing of the past. I bought this one just for the hell of it and Im glad I did.I know alot of people have never accepted Brian Johnstons vocals But I think they are great on this CD.This CD is better than &quot;The razors Edge&quot; and alot of people think it  is the best AC/DC record since Back In Black.I know I may catch alot of flack for this next statement...but I believe this CD is BETTER than Back in Black.&quot;back In BLack&quot; has ac/dc's best songs in The Title track and &quot;You shook me all night long&quot;,but &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;  has more Good songs I think.
0060976624|5.0|This book is hilarious!  Even though Nick Naylor manages to nail every woman in the book, I'd still do him myself if given the chance.  He manages to make the combination of unethical and intelligent into something appealing and sexy.<br />A must-read!
0380729407|4.0|Something Wicked This Way Comes is an interesting and highly entertaining melding of fantasy and horror. The book is not exactly fast-paced, but it is a smooth and pretty quick read, and quite suspenseful (a trio Bradbury usually manages to evoke.) Bradbury has a very unique style. He has been called a &quot;prose poet&quot; and that is a highly accurate description. Though he is writing literary fiction here, it is almost as if you're reading poetry at times. He uses metaphor often and it is quite effective. The only problem with this is that the dialoge at times, though beautiful, can see a bit unrealistic. Alas. The book is a great read. The fascinating portrayal of evil and self-responsibility is all the more effective due to the two protoganists being teenagers. The relationship between one of the boys (Will) and his Father is very touching as well. Just a well-written book. Recommended.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is my second review of the &quot;Violator&quot; CD. My favorite track is &quot;World in my Eyes&quot;. This CD really pumps out some great bass even with my small computer speakers. All the other tracks are pretty good too. I have always been a big fan of Depeche Mode. &quot;Violator&quot; will be a very tough act to follow. Just my opinion.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I ordered this CD after seeing the video to Clint Eastwood once on MTV2, and got it in the mail the day after it was released, and it's a great blend of styles that can't really be catogarized, but it's plain good.  I'd recommend this CD to anyone that likes an alternative to POP music.
B00004T9AS|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I am a big Mike Oldfield fan, anyone can see that by looking at my reviews. However, I was highly disappointed with this album. This album is not simply not any good... it won't appeal to fans of Mike's early, sprawling, epic-length works, or even to fans of his 80's &quot;pop&quot; tunes. I have always greatly preferred the epic works, but some of his 80's albums, Islands in particular, had some truly good pop songs on them. But Mike had been walking the line between acceptable, and occasionally great, and unabashedly corny pop songs since the early 80's and albums like Five Miles Out. With this album he finally hit rock bottom. Thankfully, he veered away from this tripe and back into great music soon after (Tubular Bells 2, anyone?) I think he realized he had gone too far. The songs here are weak and are only occasionally even saved by Mike's startling music. It could be almost anybody. I hate to insult any Oldfield album this way, as he is one of my favorite artists and a highly respectable musician, but this album just doesn't stand up to the masterpieces he has released in the past. The only reason I'm even keeping this album in my collection is because the last song Nothing But/Bridge To Paradise is actually quite good. If you are a DIEHARD Mike Oldfield fan, you'll want to buy this album for that song, and to complete your collection. Otherwise avoid.
B000003S5H|5.0|Air, a powerful duo out of France, is one of the better synthisizer-oriented bands I have ever heard. Put up the Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk discs because this blows them out of the water. Air produces a sound that I can only describe as ambient. Its not so bad to the point where the music is lingering and not changing; it still has depth and the more upbeat songs definently have an almost funk-based groove to them. I'd recommend this cd highly to anyone regardless of whether or not they like electronic music.
B00003CXRP|5.0|This is a, good movie about a guy named, Chuck he has to fly before Christmas he does, so his Fed-Ex plane crashes he gets stranded on a island for 4 years this is a great movie the features are good. So go buy this DVD it's worth watching.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|I'm not sure where to start this review about how awful I thought this movie was. I guess i'll start with Baz Lurhman's direction, for those who are unfamiliar with his work he's the auteur behind the equally bad Romeo &amp; Juliet movie of a few years ago, Strictly Ballroom &amp; the Sunscreen song. I get the impression from his work that he is the kind of director who loves Shakespeare and is a fan of musicals but has come from the Roland Emmerich (ID4, Godzilla) school of directing. He's covered up this movie with nothing but flashy set pieces, special effects, and a musical that comprises itself with modern music ranging from Madonna to Queen instead of trying to be original and tell a good story or have new and fresh music for that matter. If your trying to make a musical set in the past why would you use a Madonna song? there's plenty of talented musicians out there who could write original material for this movie but I guess that would cut out the audience that this movie targets (MTV zombies). This movie is put together like a big music video with no shot lasting longer than three seconds in fact I saw a video the other day for this movie and I couldn't tell the difference between the two. I really wish Baz Luhrman would go do work on broadway so I wouldn't have to worry about him making more movies. As far as musicals go, this is probably one of the worst i've ever seen. Musicals aren't really my forte but I have seen some great ones such as Grease, Wizard of Oz, Little shop of Horrors, and several Disney films all of which are miles better. Also In case you haven't figured out yet by the movie trailers the Moulin Rouge is a story of Love. Sure enough Baz beats you over the head with the concept of love every five minutes on the minute, much in the same way Steven Soderbergh does in traffic with his drugs are bad message. Does anyone on this planet not understand the concept of love or the concept of drugs are bad for that matter? I'm glad we have these stupid filmmakers to tell us these obvious messages instead of entertaining us. If your looking for an entertaining movie about love my recommendations are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Life Is Beautiful, or Shakespeare in Love. Whether you agree with me or not on some of these choices, one thing is certain they didn't insult me like Moulin Rouge did.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Early reviewers of the original release of this LP called it the best live rock 'n roll album ever. I doubt anyone has come along since to eclipse their performances. The remaster adds some tracks that were not on the LP. To me, these don't add a lot, but they are a great historical archive.
B000059HGY|5.0|Tora! Tora! Tora! is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  Everything that is in it just makes the movie better.  I like how it tells both of the stories from the American and the Japanese sides.  My favorite part is when Admiral Yamamoto says: &quot;I fear we have awaken a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve&quot;  Nothing could have been closer to the truth.  If you watch the movie, you will get a glimpse of the whole story and all of the mistakes that the Americans made, they had all of the warnings and yet 2,000 Americans died because some person at the radar station was told to ignore it.  You just have to ask yourself why that happened.  The sight at the end where the ships are burning made the anger burn inside me and made tears come from my eyes.  Any American that would  have watched that sight would want to get revenge to.
B00005ATQI|5.0|The Stanley  Kubrick  film the Shining from 1980,  this movies been my favorite for years. one of the best horrors i ever seen. Jack Nicholson takes the roll as the winter caretaker. Jack Nicholson does a outstanding job in the part , who only couldve don this good of a job. what a cast this movie has , Everyone does well, From a Elevator pouring out an ocean of blood ,solotude and isolation becomes a problem,  spooky snow scenes, a rotting corpse in a bath tub, eerie scenes, eerie sounds and music, even the music when the movie first starts, JAck sabotages the radio and the snowcat, Danny and Scatman Crothers as Dick Halloran and the Over look hotel it self  shares  ESP. What ever happened to Danny Lloyd?  seeing things that havent happeend yet, even soem things that happened a long time ago. Wendys  face as the Ax goes through the door.  I love the steps scene, my favorite part.i think soem parts will leave you laughing .  I think this is the  best  horror movie made. so if you like JAck Nicholson and horror youll absolutley love this movie so what a re you waiting for ?
B00004XQ83|5.0|i am a huge fan of pop and modern rock music, when my brother brought the movie home from the rental store, i gagged, simply put. but when i heard the music i fell in love. we sing the contemporary version of &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; at my church, but it's nowhere near as good as the old fashioned version. i also manage a teen christian pop band, and we are going to sing &quot;down in the river to pray.&quot; this soundtrack is awesome. if you haven't ever listened to bluegrass music you should.
0446677450|2.0|This book will not make you rich.  This guy made a bunch of money in real estate by buying properties that increased in value, but he hints that many of those opportunities are gone or difficult to find.  He says that you should own a business instead of working for someone else.  This is good advice, but not worth buying the book.  He says that you should not borrow heavily (home, auto, etc) since you're throwing money away.  Again, good advice, but not worth buying the book.  Beyond these, the book doesn't say much.  It's a waste of paper, with a catchy title.
B000059XYL|5.0|this is definitely more of a chick flick than a guy movie! in all honesty though, its a GREAT movie. although geared more towards younger girls, i'm sure anyone could enjoy this movie! its just an all out great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone!
B000002H70|5.0|i'd like to give this record six stars.  it trancsends genres; it could be enjoyed by most anyone.  there's more earnest soulfulness here than on any rolling stones record and as many memorable tunes as anything the beatles ever did.  and there's more sincerity and vivid imagery than both of them put together.  put this one on the player, lay down in the middle of the living room, and it's an experience like few records can provide.  mesmerizing.
B000056VIY|2.0|i give this a two because there are only two good songs on the whole cd.  the songs in which jennifer had a sigificant part in writing are really bad.  i really like jennifer lopez, but her talent as a songwriter?......nonexistant.  they sound like songs i could write.  i like on the 6 a lot better than j.lo just because there is actual substance.
B000005H55|5.0|Often when I listen to 'avant garde' or free jazz, I appreciate it, but I don't really enjoy it in the traditional sense.  I have a couple of Ornette Coleman albums that come to mind.<br />&quot;Out to Lunch&quot; has, as Dolphy states, a pulse.  There's a rhythmic line expressed or implied throughout the music.  When the players 'stray' away from it, it's exciting to hear because their musical lines are like birds flying off from the ground of the beat, and occasionally being pulled back into it.  Much of free jazz sounds totally arbitrary compared to this.  If you like Mingus and Monk I think you'll enjoy &quot;Out to Lunch&quot;.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is the first film I can remember that starred the musical arranger.  While there are many very, very good things in this film it is dominated by its soundtrack, and well after seeing the movie, after you have forgotten the characters and what they said, you will vividly remember the music.  Burnett also was the musical director for THE BIG LEBOWSKI, and I was tremendoulsy impressed in that one with his musical selections, especially the hysterical Spanish language version of &quot;Hotel California.&quot;  But Burnett outdid himself in O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?  All of the songs were newly recorded for the film, but each one felt as if it had stepped right out of the 1920s or 1930s, when they were all written.  Every single one of the songs was memorably and magnificently performed, in particular the great traditional song &quot;Man of Constant Sorrows,&quot; whose unexpected success on the radio plays a major role in the movie's plot.<br />(Sidenote:  anyone who loved the version of &quot;Man of Constant Sorrows&quot; in this film owes it to themselves to search out a CD with the Stanley Brothers performing this song.  Ralph Stanly in fact performed one of the songs in the move:  the eerie &quot;Oh Death&quot; performed at the KKK ralley.  The Stanley Brothers consisted of Ralph and his slightly older brother Carter.  As good as Ralph is, Carter Stanley, who unfortunately died in 1966, had almost without question the greatest voice in the history of Bluegrass.  And absolutely no one ever sang &quot;Man of Constant Sorrows&quot; better than Carter Stanley.  Whereas Ralph possesses a fine voice that is somewhere between a low tenor and a high baritone, Carter possessed a high, brilliant, piercing tenor that is one of the glories of American folk music.)<br />The music alone makes this a great movie.  Without it, the movie would have lost a lot of its cohesion and texture.  I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, but if you take away the music, this film would probably rate as their weakest film yet with the exception of THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.  The film on its own doesn't quite cohere at every moment, and there are some moments that are just flat out weak.  But as a whole, the movie has a tremendous period feel and a wealth of great minor characters.<br />I thought George Clooney excelled as an escaped convict with a penchant for Dapper Dan hair pomade and sentences that make him sound considerably smarter than he is.<br />So, my recommendation is twofold:  first, see and enjoy the movie.  Second, run out and buy the soundtrack!  This movie just might have the best movie soundtrack to have come out in several years.bly rate as their weakest film yet with the exception of THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.

B00004XQ83|5.0|What a very plesant surprise.  Great movie with wonderful sound-track.  I had to go by the audio CD the very next day.  This is a keeper!!
B000002BSV|5.0|It seems a shame because everytime I play this CD in my car, my friends (even someone who only listens to Aerosmith and Bon Jovi and such) ask me about the band and tell me they love the CD.  This is rare for me, because a lot of the other Britpop bands I listen to don't appeal to most people!<br />Anyways, this is a really fun CD.  I first heard &quot;Filmstar,&quot; &quot;Beautiful One,&quot; and &quot;Trash&quot; at a dance club and I was instantly hooked.  Now, I'm a huge Suede fan (and not just because Brett is amazingly beautiful)...hopefully, one day Suede will get the recognition they deserve and I won't get the response &quot;You mean the fabric, like leather&quot; when I talk about Suede!<br />By the way, someone said Bernard Sumner was a former member of Suede, which is wrong.  Bernard BUTLER was in Suede, Bernard Sumner is the lead singer of NEW ORDER!  I just had to clarify because I almost had a heart attack upon reading the (wrong) info that he was in Suede!
B00003CXN4|1.0|How about jam this disk where the sun don't shine.  This appears to be another one of those &quot;message&quot; movies, and I'm not on the same frequency, can't seem to pick up the signal.   I sure do wish I had rented this one before buying.  (I would have still felt cheated) Again, so much for thinking that if &quot;so-and-so&quot; is in the movie it should be good.   Let's start a satisfaction guaranteed movement!!

B00003W8NM|5.0|This DVD package is not to be missed.  Besides the tremendous &quot;Fight Club&quot; feature presented in all its glorious widescreen perfection (this movie really suffers artistically when cut to the small screen) and pristine CD quality stereo sound (the sound is so important to the effectiveness of the film that this is also a must), you get almost more extras than you know what to do with.  First, the commentary tracks are superb and offer insights into many aspects of the film ranging from its meaning to its construction.  The commentary with David Fincher, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter is especially enjoyable and makes you feel as if you are in the room watching with them.  At some points it feels as if Helena Bonham Carter's dialogue is injected which leads me to believe that her comments were recorded seperately and that detracts from the comradarie a little bit, but it is still well worth listening to.  The track with David Fincher is very interesting as well especially if you consider, as I do, this man to be among the best directors working today.  He goes into detail about the trials of converting his vision into reality and it is a wonderful insight into the craft of filmaking.  The track with Chuck Palahnuik is very good as well, he seems just tickled to see the movie and is delighted with how well his concept came across on the big screen.  He gives background, through interesting anecdotes, as to where his ideas came from and these stories themselves sound as if they would make a great movie.  Other features include deleted scenes that are well worth looking at, a short documentary about the making of the movie, conceptual stills, storyboards, location scouting, all with multiple commentaries.  This package has everything you could ever want, do not hesitate to get it.
B000002UZU|5.0|This album changed my life.<br />I came across it quite by accident at a time when I had only a passing familiarity with &quot;The Hook&quot;. What I heard here changed me forever. Hooker (clearly enamored with Alan Wilson), and Canned Heat (clearly even more enamored with their hero John Lee) add a sense of life and enthusiasm missing from most of the poorer Hooker records. John plays by himself for most of Disc One, and then is slowly joined- first by Alan Wilson- then by the rest of the band. The album which had started out slow and &quot;melluh&quot; and gradually picked up speed rollicks through a couple of rockers with a jubilant Canned Heat- crowned finally by a wild 12 minute romp that changes in beat and texture throughout.<br />This album is largely disregarded in the blues and rock press. The record is raw- complete with false starts and dialogue. Also, it was recorded during an unheralded and otherwise unproductive period for Hooker. It is, therefore, no surprise that not many people have ever heard this.<br />I'm glad I did.<br />For anyone, like me, weary of the overproduced and distant sounds of modern pop, rock and blues- Hooker'N'Heat is a gritty yet stunningly beautiful reminder of the power of live music. Six guys in a room- feeding off each other, bouncing off each other- weaving a rhythmical and melodic tapestry that rocks- then swerves and changes- and rocks again.<br />Hearing this music has forever changed my approach to recording- and to listening. Thank You John and Canned Heat.<br />-Matt<br />P.S. A mark of great music is that it inspires. Every time I hear this I immediately have to pick up a guitar and plug in because yes, John, &quot;I Feeeeel GOOOD!&quot;
6305127697|5.0|Usually, I stay away from courtroom dramas because they're the same thing over and over, but this one truly is different.  The story may seem a little familiar if you've seen films of this nature before, but I can guarantee that as you continue to watch it, you'll see how well this movie rises above the rest.<br />Making his first major debut, Edward Norton is nothing short if terrific in the role of Aaron.  He was robbed of the Oscar for doing the great job that he did throughout.  Richard Gere has never given a truly bad performance, but he does go a step above his usually sleepy-looking acting style by showing some good raw emotion.  Andre Braugher has always been a great actor and will continue to be a great actor, and Laura Linney shows that she's always been a fine actress (nevermind the miserable CONGO).  The direction by Gregory Hoblit is great and fast-paced and I recommend that you take a look at Hoblit's FALLEN if you liked this film.<br />I cannot rave enough about the acting here, so I'll just stop now, but first I have to end by saying that throughout this slick film, it never gets bogged down in pretentiousness, as many courtroom thrillers do.  You'll love this film all the way up until the true shocker of an ending.
B00003CXP1|5.0|When I first watched Requiem for a Dream I didn't know that I was getting a guided tour through Hell. As a big fan of Pi already, I was very excited to see this movie. Not being 17 at the time, I didn't see it in the theatres, so I rented it when it came out (the edited version.) I bring it home and start up my self-deconstruction. A few friends that had seen it were discussing it and talked about how intense the movie was. I go through Summer and Fall not understanding how they could think this movie was intense... I was rather confused. Then Winter set in and I realized what exactly they were talking about. I could try to explain how this movie had me crying in a fetal position or how I couldn't sleep because all I could think about was the movie. It wouldn't help, I have tried it before, reccomending this movie to all that I thought would understand the impact of this work of art. The best I can do is say, rent this movie, and watch it.
0452282152|3.0|The style of writing itself is excellent, don't get me wrong, it's just that I found the artist Vermeer's depiction totally unsympathetic, his wife a crass, much put-upoun harridan, and the girl Griet although supposedly quite clever, in the end a simpleton about the way of the world in which she lived. This book does absolutely nothing good for the artist Vermeer's charachter, portraying him as weak, vain, and insensitive, especially towards his wife, who although a bit silly, in my opinion deserved much better than what was handed out to her.....reading books like these always leave me with a sense of injustice, and quite frankly, for that I can just pick up a newspaper.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Since I bought this CD last week, it hasn't left my stereo. These songs are catchy, loveable, and utterly Rufus. Which is to say, nobody else could have created them. If Joseph Arthur had a sense of humor, or Thom Yorke decided pop was his thing after all, maybe they could record an album like this one. Then again, that's a stupid analogy. Don't worry about silly reviews, just give Rufus a listen.
B000002OX7|5.0|It would be really really tough not to rewrite what most reviewers here have said before, so I'll keep it very simple...buy it, listen to it, take it on your next summer vacation...and it will offer you the best memories life has to give. And I'm not even touching upon the extra tracks; \\"Pure And Easy\\", \\"Baby, Don't You Do It\\", \\"The Naked Eye\\"...just when you thought it couldn't POSSIBLY get any better! All the guitar tracks stand out clearer than ever; let's face it, you really can't miss with this one. It would take me a week to extoll its virtues, but for the sake of sanity...do yourself this favor; you will not regret it one bit. Thanx Pete, Roger, John and last but NEVER least...Keith :)
0679879269|4.0|Pullman has scored a masterful conclusion to his trilogy that is fascinating,even though a little slower paced than the previous chapters. Your questions will be answered and your attention rewarded. Well done.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|As far as musicals go, I have not been the biggest fan of the genre...oh, I loved the weird and wonderful (at times)movie version of the Who's Tommy...but am not the biggest fan of Rocky Horror or campy classics like Grease.  I also have not been a big fan of the movies coming out lately, but this was a refreshing change indeed!  Baz has delivered once again with a very fantasy driven, colourful, lush, cinematically sound picture...full of interesting characters and wonderful cinematography... I was suprised the beautiful Nicole Kidman could sing... Ewan was equally up to his role... I loved some of the musical arangements, and I thought it was kind of neat how they incorporated many contemporary classics (Elton John's Your Song sung throughout the movie) could have skipped including Celine... Dion's chez-o- disaster-piece &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;...but oh well... oh yeah, advertising that hideous version of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;  was not a good idea. It is such a terrible version too.  Even worse than &quot;All Saints&quot; version. luckly, it was not included in the movie. From a movie and music fan who usually likes pieces by the likes of Kubrick and Scorcese, it is definately a work to be appriciated... anyways.. BUP-BUP! PEACE!
6300213714|5.0|This movie has been my Daddy's favorite since he first saw it, and it was the same way with me. The Warriors has two of the most copied lines ever - &quot;Can you DIGGIT?&quot; and &quot;Warriors, come out to PLAY-E-YAY!&quot;. For some odd reason the beginning was cut from all the movies and frankly I don't know why because it just ruins the whole effect. But seriously, if you haven't seen this movie, get out and rent it. Hell, why not just buy it because once you see it, you're gonna love it and you'll want to watch it everyday until you die, man. You'll plan a trip to Coney Island and try to find the gang, which is harder than you could possibly imagine because when I went there I didn't see any gangs just a bunch of drunk carnies and they didn't look like &quot;The Best&quot; to me...it's still a good movie though...
B000002UYZ|4.0|&quot;The Beatles No. 1&quot; does not do justice to the Beatles as the best album.  The Red Album and the Blue Album are for those looking for the Beatles' real best album.  These are the musics that are passed on from one generation to the other.  Then why am I rating this only 4 stars?  Because while the album is the best of the best, CD is completely thoughtless.  Why should there be two CDs.  This could easily be a single CD.  And the case!  It is way too thick.  Did the record company think the consumers would think it is more authentic this way?
B00004Y6O9|3.0|There's only so much remastering can accomplish with Van Halen's early catalog if not remixing from scratch.  And make no mistake --these CDs are AAD, not ADD-- which is ancient CD nomenclature for digitally remastering an old analog stereo master.  But this time they used a better analog master, or so the story goes, until they find a better one.<br />But a complete remastering would have had little impact on Van Halen I if digital gurus were faithful to the original mix.  Because let's face it; Ted Templeman was a pretty ... producer --packing Eddie's guitar off hard on one side of the mix and submerging Michael Anthony's pedestrian bass playing below audible levels.  And for all of Eddie's talking up his &quot;brown sound&quot;, his guitar sounds more or less like an overdriven AM radio drenched in cheap echo on this CD.<br />That's not to say the performances aren't top drawer, though completely dated and a bit off the cuff, and the CD is sure to please anyone who only wants one Roth Van Halen CD.

6303212379|5.0|The Goonies is the best film ever created like a book you cant put down.  it has all the entertainment elements for every age.  a MUST SEE!
B000002UZ1|4.0|&quot;The Beatles No. 1&quot; does not do justice to the Beatles as the best album.  For those Beatles beginners looking for the best album, the Red Album and the Blue Album are your choice.  These are the anthologies of the musics that are passed on from one generation to the other.  Then why am I rating this 4 stars?  It is because the CD version is completely thoughtless.  This could have easily been a single CD.  The CD case is too bulky.  What was the record company thinking?
6305089957|4.0|MOST SEQUELS DON'T MEASURE UP TO THE ORIGINAL, BUT THIS ONE IS ACUTALLY VERY GOOD.  IT PICKS UP A FEW YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ONE ENDS WITH NEVE CAMPBELL BACK WITH DAVID ARQUETTE AND COURTNEY COX.   THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SCARY MOVIE?
B00005B4GU|5.0|For starters, this album is nothing like OK Computer and nothing like Kid A. In fact, there is nothing out there to even remotely compare this album to. Suffice to say there are some truly great Radiohead moments here, notably &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; (which sounds like a nod to Ben Folds Five), &quot;You and Whose Army&quot;, &quot;Knives Out&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac/Morning Bell&quot;. The sound textures are hauntingly beautiful and push the experimental envelope a step further on songs like the techno chaos of &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; and the dissonant jazz-rock of &quot;Life In A Glass House&quot;. If OK Computer was Sgt. Pepper, this is The White Album my friends. An extremely rewarding listen.
B00003CX5P|3.0|The Phantom Menace is arguably one of the most anticipated films in motion picture history. So it stands to reason that George Lucas and company would have a hard time delivering on the expectations of his own Empire, which has grown more than two decades old and accumulated hundreds of millions of fans.<br />It also makes plain Lucas' dilemma: who IS his audience? Is it a massive army of twenty and thirty-somethings old enough to have seen the original trilogy when it was released in theatres in the late 70's and early 80's? Or is it the post Barney set, fresh from their last trip to the video store where they rented that dusty old space movie Dad kept talking about?<br />If he makes the Teletubby version of his obsessively awaited prequel, he attracts children...AND their parents, who will then be forced to run to Toys R' us after the show to buy little Billy or little Sue the Jar Jar doll with the retractible tongue.<br />It's the practical side of me that forgives Lucas this decision. Moviemaking is, in the end, about profit. It is business, and butts in seats equals money. Anything short of that is labeled a nonsuccess. Don't believe me? I could list for you a litany of critically acclaimed films that could have had a sequel if not for the fact that they had little audience. The opposite is true for awful movies that attract massive audiences. Witness Dumb and Dumber. Was there anything there that warranted a sequel? I think not. So my practical side understands.<br />It's the artist and wide-eyed child in me that's disappointed. Lucas has delivered so many moments of pure fluff, you'll think it's harvest time at Eli Whitney's place. Jar Jar Binks, a malconceived comic relief in a story that never explores its serious side enough to warrant one, is so distracting you'll find yourself putting your attention on pause until the screen relieves itself of his malodorous presence. He's interesting for the first few seconds, because overall the graphic work is prettyamazing, but after that I wanted to dig out my own eyeballs with a garden weasel.<br />Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, fine actors who generally raise the bar of any production they take part in, seem uncomfortable and out of place. Their lines are stilted, probably the result of a hideous script that never finds a unifying tone. One minute, it's all darkness and fear, the next we're suffering a farting pack animal. No, I'm serious. A FARTING PACK ANIMAL. And in case Dolby surround 5.1 isn't good enough to get the point across, we then have to watch the CG Jar Jar hold his nose and make cartoon faces in response. Thanks, George. I wasn't sure the animal had ACTUALLY farted. I thought maybe a subwoofer blew out.<br />One of the bigger insults to Star Wars fans will be something called &quot;Metachlorians,&quot; which apparently are the source of The Force. They are some sort of tiny symbiont, or maybe they're a chloride group. It would explain my tendency to want to doze throughtout the flick. In any case reducing The Force, which most of us had accepted as religion, to a biological event is not just disappointing, it obliterates any trace of mystery Lucas had built over the course of the three previous films.<br />All this said, the film has some bright spots. The vast majority of the special effects (which soak each and every frame, this is truly a filmmaking milestone) are stunning. Nothing even close to this level of reality has ever been attempted, much less accomplished. The few that are less than stellar probably wouldn't be noticed if it weren't for the high quality of the remainder.<br />Sound, sound editing, music, set design and costumes far exceed any other movie released in '99, including The Matrix, despite its awards. <br />And buried beneath a mile or so of marshmallow, goosedown and foam rubber is a core story that is quite complex and very clever. We know what the future is, and Lucas uses that to drop what are sometimes very subtle hints about why the characters we grew up with are the way they are.<br />Which is why you need to watch the film three or more times. If you see it only once, you've missed alot that went on while you were trying to settle back into the story after a Jar Jar appearance. By the third viewing, you'll be able to tune him out, and the movie rises up a level.<br />Overall, Menace could have been a MUCH better film, but isn't as bad as what you might have been led to believe. I understand someone re-edited it to eliminate most of Jar Jar and other extraneous kiddie fluff and it made it a truly great film. Maybe Lucas will get the hint and deliver a more Star Wars like prequel when Episode II arrives in 2002.
B00004Y635|3.0|THE FIRST AND SECOND ONES WERE DONE VERY WELL AND WERE REALLY GOOD.  THEY SHOULD HAVE ENDED THIS WITH THE SECOND.  THIS ONE IS NO WHERE AS SCARY, OR AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS 2.<br />THEY BRING BACK DAVID ARQUETTE, NEVE CAMBELL AND COURTNEY COX FROM THE OTHER 2 AND THEY REALLY, REALLY TRY TO MAKE THIS ONE WORK BUT CAN'T.  THIS MOVIE IS REALLY POINTLESS AND FUNNY. BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK THEY WANTED IT TO BE FUNNY.  THEY REALLY MISSED THEIR MARK ON THIS ONE.  IF YOU SAW THE OTHER TWO, CONSIDER THE SERIES DONE WITH THE SECOND ONE AND DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is the best yet.  More interesting than OK Computer, and more listenable than Kid A.  Out of all the Radiohead albums, this one will find its way back into my stereo the most often.  Just stop calling them a rock band.  You want rock, buy the new Superdrag or the new Burning Airlines.
B00003CXE7|3.0|I really think the OSCARS [are bad]. I think there is good acting here, i mean Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix have shown they are good actors, but these are not extraordinary perfomances. Crowe didn't deserve the oscar either the movie. And Phoenix should have been nominated for QUILLS instead of GLADIATOR. There are some really good fight scenes, especially the one that has the tigers, but i can't understand why this movie is considered as a masterpice. THE THIN RED LINE is a masterpice and it didn't get any award. I think i will not watch anymore the Oscars.
B00004SWBD|4.0|I had first heard about slipknot in a metal magazine. I was looking 4 something to bang my head 2 so i bought slipknot. I wasnt disapointed. The music is filled with great guiatar riffs and angry vocals. The first half of the songs on the album were really the best. the last half of the songs ended up sounding the same. but the first half more then makes up 4 the lack of diversity in the last half. wait and bleed features some very good vocals and the lyrics are very good and have meaning in them. (sic) is a good start to this album and is just great to bang your head to. spit it out and surfacing have a great sound as well. with this cd i can get pumped to, i can bang my head to, i can let of steam with it, and i can relate to it. there is some rapping, but its very well covered up by distorted heavy metal riffs and drum beats. and by the way, ive heard all the lyrics and its not that bad an album. thers no stuff about raping girls, no guns, no attacks on religoun or god, no devil worshiping stuff, and its not evan that violent. most of it is just anger at life and the world. sure thers plenty of ..., but who cares? if u like moshable riffs angry vocals, or if your a metal fan, buy this album. and if your afended by there image or there cussing, DONT LISTEN TO THEM.
B000001FMX|5.0|THIS IS NOT PUNK. The Dolls were a very good glam METAL band. So many people think that this is punk and that The Stooges are punk. The first punk rock band in America was The Ramones.
B0000028RR|5.0|This CD is one of my absolute favorites.  I must have listened to this one over 100 times.  This guitars, vocals and drums are all excellent and moving.  I recommend this one to anyone into rap/metal or someone that think all that Linkin Park stuff is god.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I've been waiting on this one since I first saw the video for &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; a few weeks ago, and I'm not disappointed!  There's something on this disk for everyone.  It's very diverse, mixing almost every style imaginable.  Totally sweet!
0811826848|5.0|Even if you've read all the Beatles books, the number of interesting never-before-revealed facts that the Beatles themselves talk about in this book will pleasantly surprise you. It's a big book but you don't notice the time when you're reading this book. If you've never bought a Beatles book, buy this one. It's absolutely fantastic.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Ok, this DVD is great. The Beginning documentary is absolutely fantastic, probably the best extra on a DVD in a long time. The deleted scenes which were completed for the DVD are also quite cool. But all this just makes me want the original 3 Star Wars on DVD even more. Obviously Lucas can put together a very excellent DVD, so what is he waiting for with the originals. Come on George- there are millions of people waiting for Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi to come out on DVD, what's the big hold-up??? Now that you've released Phantom Menace (which is certainly the worst star wars of the bunch) you should release the others. <br />I heard he wants to release them in order, so he won't release 4,5,&amp; 6 until 2 &amp; 3 are made and released. If that is true then i guess we'll have to wait another 5 or 6 years to see the original classic Star Wars trilogy on DVD. Too bad DVd's probably won't even be around by then.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Oh yeah!!!  Star Wars is coming to DVD!!  October 16 can't get here fast enough!!  Six hours of extra stuff!!  The time we have all waited for has finally arri...  <br />Oh wait, never mind.  It's actually Episode 1 that is coming out on DVD, perhaps the biggest disappointment in film history.  So sorry for the false alarm.  I guess it's back to waiting until Lucas gets off his butt and releases the original trilogy, movies that were actually good.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Needed room for improvement. Nevertheless, very entertaining and breathtaking. The film had style but less substance than the Original trilogy, but awesome. One of my favourite movies.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Don't listen to the reviews, just watch it. You'll be suprised how wonderful this film is.
0767827015|5.0|Put together a thought-provoking concept and the sexiest man on the planet and you have the ingredients for an incredible movie.   With the violence and hardship Tre and his friends live with every day and the way they try to overcome it, and Laurence Fishburne (as Tre's father)you have just that.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I really like it, as much as I like everything by Britney. I think this CD is great. It shows how Britney have grown up and became more experienced. She gets better with every CD!
6301966015|5.0|WHAT MORE COULD ONE WANT: ACTION, THRILLING, SUSPENSE, NOT TO MENTION THE STUNNING PROVACATIVE VANESSA REDGRAVE. ADD TO THAT JEFF BECK &amp; THE YARDBIRDS WITH JIMMY PAGE BRING THE BEST OF MUSIC TO THE FOREFRONT OF THIS GREAT MOVIE.
0380973650|5.0|A story for those who want a story, rather than just a plot. Gaiman creates worlds and characters that are familiar, slightly off, and far more engaging than the &quot;normal.&quot; As always with Gaiman, there is more than meets the eye and more than most would ever care to point out - thank heavens he thinks to let the rest of us in on his secrets.  Gaiman fans will certainly love 'American Gods', as would fans of English humor, David Lynch, Chris Carter, and Penn and Teller. If you're unfamiliar with Gaiman's work, this is an excellent starting place.
B000002C4J|5.0|Yes, Celine does fall into the light category, but there is a deep quality to her voice, and a good range of material.  On this record, I especially enjoyed &quot;Treat Her Like A Lady&quot;, &quot;Where Is The Love&quot;, &quot;When I Need You&quot;, &quot;My Heart Will Go On (of course)&quot; and (also of course) the title song, &quot;Let's Talk About Love&quot;.  She's not typical top 40, or an accomplished jazz type singer, but she comes out with varied, emotionally tinged, and just plain enjoyable performances.
6305313687|5.0|I had seen parts of this movie on HBO, but never the whole thing before now.  This movie is amazing.  It was so hard for me to comprehend the idea that people can hate other people for the way they look, or for what they believe in, but this movie, even though it is fiction, opened my eyes to the reality that hate is taught and that people follow other people blindly just to believe in something.<br />This movie is extremely graphic(which adds to the reality of the subject), and not for the weak of stomach.  There is a lot of foul language and male nudity, but I think everybody should see this movie. <br />All of the performances are incredible.  Norton (who gained 30 pounds of muscle for this movie, and looks really sexy all buffed up) submerges himself into the role of Derek Vinyard.  I felt like I was watching reality television as I watched him. I remember watching the trailer for the movie and saying to myself that it would be one to miss, I think because I wanted to shelter myself from the topic, but I am so glad I saw this movie.
0060254920|5.0|The illustrations, the imagination, the pure energy of Where the Wild Things Are fills other reviews here.  I wanted to rebut another review posted that suggested that this was a horrible book because it seemed to condone bad behavior in children. <br />Part of the charm of Where the Wild Things Are stems from the fact that sometimes children are mischevious and cause a &quot;wild rumpus&quot; -- but they're still loved, no matter what.  So even though Max gets sent to bed without his supper, when he returns from the journey of his imagination, the one who &quot;loves him the most&quot; has left him something good to eat.  And it's still hot! <br />To those who think Where the Wild Things Are exemplifies bad behavior, I gnash my terrible teeth and roll my terrible eyes.  Lighten up!
0312243022|1.0|A friend recommended this book, and I think he was trying to impress his girlfriend by having read it.  Pretentious, flowery writing swamps a thin storyline.  The saving grace is a neat little narrative tie-in towards the end.  This is the kind of novel that wins awards because it deals with 'important' subjects - homosexuality, suicide, AIDS, etc.  Thinking back on how I had to endure reading this for my book club, I'm going to scale my rating to a 1.
0694003611|5.0|The lyrical text of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; has made it a beloved favorite with my two girls.  The simple, colorful illustrations are enchanting and even though I know the entire book by heart, I love sharing it again and again with my children.<br />This is my standard baby gift -- I believe no child should have to go to sleep without hearing the words &quot;in the great green room...&quot;
0783233477|5.0|&quot;DEATH&quot;...It Is The Sound Of Ones Own Voice Echoing Back From Eternity...<br />Everything about the feature film &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; is extraordinary.  From the script to direction, performances of the key actors, musical score and production.  The DVD is Full screen with sharp vivid color and crisp clear sound.  The DVD is much better than the VHS format with respect to picture and sound quality without a doubt.          There is so much going on in this film and so much to take in that it's almost overwhelming.  It's a story about the joy and pain of life and it's a story about death.  However, in this film &quot;Death&quot; is not portrayed as the dark cloaked figure or celestial being you might expect.  Instead, the focus is cast on &quot;Death's&quot; lighter side, gentler side and venerable side when he takes human form.         This is a movie that must be viewed several times before one can truly appreciate the depth and magnitude of it.  It cannot be appreciated unless careful attention is given to the dialogue.  There are two scenes in the movie that call for special attention.  The scene in Bill Parrish's (Anthony Hopkins) office, following the &quot;Big Meeting with John Bonneque&quot; and the final scene with Joe Black (Brad Pitt) and Susan Parrish.  You may discover the dialogue in these scenes hold a key to a mystery. This is a movie you want to watch without interruption, and once you have ask yourself; When given the concept that &quot;Death's&quot; powers on his turf are somewhat boundless and that he obviously has some ongoing arrangement with, shall we say &quot;Father Time.&quot;  How inconceivable then, is the idea that &quot;Death&quot; may also possess the ability to turn back time?
B00005214X|5.0|This masterpiece is simply the best rendering of any Beatles-inspired music, during the band's legendary tenure or after the death of Lennon.  Harrison is unquestionably the most underrated member of the band, and as this album shows, it's best songwriter.  Granted, he got a little weird at this point in his career, hence the hare krishna stuff - but it doesn't take away the fact that Harrison attained a musical peak with &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; that few artists ever have.  From the inspired version of Dylan's &quot;If Not for You&quot; to the haunting beauty of the title track, Harrison clearly demostrates that Lennon and McCartney, while incredibly talented, hogged too much of the spotlight back then.
B00003CXN4|4.0|First, I think this film was made kind of late...I think it would have been more compelling if made in the late 80's early 90's when the War on Drugs was in your face EVERY time you turned on the TV, radio, etc. As sad as this sounds, drugs aren't as hot a topic as they used to be. Second(spoiler alert!!!) the scene in which Michael Douglas leaves his press conference to be with his daughter is TOTALLY unbeleivable. No politican would ever do something like that, I don't care who it is...Other than that, Traffic is a excellent example of good filmmaking
B00000IPAX|4.0|OK, so I actually liked this CD because I had never heard  anything other than &quot;Dammit&quot; which is probably Blink's best song. Anyway, I liked this CD. Actually, I liked it a lot. And actually I hate pop, NOFX and MXPX are two of my favorite bands. I'm sick of all of this &quot;Blink has gone pop&quot; BS. They're a great band, and songs like &quot;Don't Leave Me&quot; and &quot;Going Away To College&quot; are great songs, bar none. Oh, they're good? The singers can sing? You can actually hear every single instrument? That makes them POP? These guys are great; I love this CD and I will for a long time. And yeah, DUDE RANCH is great too, maybe even better than this, but do not go whining just because a punk band made it.
0380973650|5.0|I read this book in 24 hours flat. I felt bad doing it too since I know it took Neil two years to write it...but how could I help myself? The story was engaging and the writing brilliant. In fact, I plan to read it again this weekend just to make sure I didn't miss anything the first time.<br />Fans of Gaiman's other work will not be disappointed -- this is his largest body of work since The Sandman series. In fact, American Gods may just be the ticket to hooking friends and family members who are too jaded to read comic books.<br />I have a literary pantheon of gods, and Neil is definitely one of the top deities.
0312937385|5.0|Maybe not.  But different enough that the comparison is probably unneccessary.  I enjoyed this book as much as any that I have read in the past 12 months, and found the concept of &quot;speaking for the dead&quot; to be entirely fascinating.
B000059TPN|5.0|I have nothing but positive things to say about this movie. It ranks up there in my top 100 favorite movies of all time. This DVD edition of The Rock has a really mind blowing, sharp picture and audio transfer. I thought I was back in the cinema watching this movie again, it's that vivid. The Rock boasts fine performances from Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery. The plot is complex and deep and I would just say that if you haven't seen this movie yet, to buy it and sit back and experience it for yourself.
B000007UR1|4.0|The original of this album has always been one of my favorite Who records.  Half of my early 1980s was spent with the vinyl record or cassette tape of this playing in the backround.<br />The question here is:  &quot;Is it worth the substantial extra loot for the remastered bonus tracks version&quot;?  <br />The answer is:  &quot;Only if you are a true fan&quot;.  If you are really only interested in a CD with &quot;You Better You Bet&quot; and &quot;Another Tricky Day&quot; on it, go with the cheaper original.  However, if you just love the sound of Roger, Pete, and John booming out great music, pick up the remaster.  The sound quality on the remaster is excellent while the bonus tracks are quite good overall.  &quot;I Like Nightmares&quot; and &quot;It's In You&quot; are excellent cuts that would have fit right in on the original album just fine.  &quot;Somebody Saved Me&quot; sounded better in Pete's redone version on the All the Best Cowboys album in 1982.  The two live cuts at the end are great Who jams recorded in 1979 and 1982 respectively.<br />I still put the remaster on shuffle most every week at work and continue to love it.
B00004VXF2|3.0|I own this CD to scare the kids in the neighborhood on Halloween.  I'm a huge Lou Reed fan but this is absolute, unlistenable noise.  Yet I still listen to it... Very odd?  What I like even better is how I've read that this album has influenced musicians.  That might be Mr. Reed greatest feat.  Loads like the slugs in Sonic Youth (who I actually like but what a bunch of musical snobs) reference this record without any irony or laughter.<br />For those of you who would like to hear a perfected version of this noise please seek out Pat Metheny's Zero Tolerance for Silence.  When I bought mine it had a quote from no other than Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore.  He praised this CD like he praised Mr. Reed's Metal Machine Music.  History always repeats I guess...
068484267X|4.0|I really loved this book, except the last chapter when it turned when it lost it's rich literacy and turned 'cheap'.  I won't go into particulars, as to not ruin the ending for you, but you'll know what I mean when you get close to the end.  Otherwise, this author is wonderful and provides a depth of feeling of what it was like to grow up Catholic and poor in Ireland. Thanks Frank.
B000050XEI|5.0|Another Wonderful Enya collection!!  You just can't go wrong if you enjoy the smooth, soothing tones of Enya's gorgeous voice.  So Relaxing...So Beautiful!!  I am Totally Pleased!!
0345440757|4.0|I found this book to be very honest and straight to the point.  I have used several of the ideas and they have helped so much, especially on breastfeeding.  I think this is a book every new mom should have on hand.  It does take some disipline, but it is worth the effort to get the end result.
B00004XOWM|2.0|This is one of those albums you could only enjoy while you're doing something else and not really paying much attention.  They have some catchy rythms but come on, how much time did it take to come up with lines like &quot;keep on rollin' rollin' rollin'...&quot;?  And the fact that they had two songs based on that line was just downright sad.  The lyrics aren't really going anywhere...or coming from anywhere for that matter.  They're kinda just there for the sake of filling up some empty space although I believe they would have been better off making this album purely instrumental.  If you're gonng listen to this album, read a magazine or watch TV to occupy your mind or you'll be hitting the skip button alot.  ...But then again, I never really was a Limp Bizkit fan....
B0000017CA|4.0|I first heard Acid Bath when I was thirteen, and I've loved them ever since. Although I'm not a big fan of heavy metal, Kite String has a sound and originality that is truley captivating. These guys are more that just big dumb rockers that I've come to expect from many haevy metal acts.  &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Scream of the Butterfly&quot; are amzing pices of guitar work, and Dax's voice wraps up a tight package that is way more than just distorted guitars and screaming. The guitar work goes from calmness to deranged in an instant, and the vocals are haunting yet beatiful.
B000056NX4|5.0|only gave it 5 stars because after all, it IS JCS.  still, Glenn Carter can *hardly* hope to beat Ted Neeley's performance in the 1973.  and Carl Anderson as Judas in '73 will always be the real betrayer.  But, this is a great REMAKE of the awesome classic (which BTW is my fave movie and Neeley is my fave actor, so i'm bias) and the new stars play their parts well, especially carter.  some notes: hosanna was very well done, as were the priest scenes.  Annas and Caiaphus were superb.  Gethsaname lacked something, I just can't pinpoint it.  Perhaps it just lacked Ted Neeley's presence.  The crucifixion wasn't done too well.  the Mary/Jesus romance in this version was fantastic.  Hmmm, anything else?  Simon Zealotes was great in this version, and wow was the temple scene a little more racy then in '73!  times change!  <br />Overall, I would recommend this film.  But more as a means of comparison to the original, which is the true Jesus Christ Superstar masterpiece.  See the '73 first.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I've got to take back an earlier assessment of mine that George Clooney can't act.  He does a wonderful acting job in this movie and no one could have been more suprised than I was to discover him as an actor. Clooney forms a trio, along with John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, of fugitives from a chain gang in Depression era Mississippi. This is the ultimate road movie with characters throughout that could have only come from the Coens' incredible imaginations.  Real life is even interspered throughout with the trio catching a ride, for example, with \\"Baby Face Nelson,\\" the notorious manic-depressive bank robber. Ulysses Everett McGill is the name of Clooney's slick con man character and this is because this story is a retelling of the \\"Odyssey\\" via the Coen brothers.<br /><br />Homer and the Coens together are a delightful combination, much more enjoyable than my reading of the source work back in high school.  The soundtrack of music from this era is fabulous too.  Our trio can even sing and makes a impressive debut as the \\"Soggy Bottom Boys.\\"  There are so many great scenes in this film that I could go on and on but I'll just highlight a few.  There is a Klu Klux Klan rally musical number that is only rivaled by \\"Springtime For Hitler\\" in \\"The Producers.\\"  It is a superb music and dance number of the proposed lynching of a black man!<br /><br />Then there is the biblical flood that looms over all but in this case is the creation of the TVA dam.  The Coens manage to make creation of the TVA into high comic film art, no small feat. The trio also runs into the Sirens, just like happens in the epic poem.  In this case they are three damsels washing in the river and singing who beguile the trio.  From this encounter flows the comic wonder of Tim Blake Nelson over his belief that the sirens may have transformed Turturro into a frog. This is a must see film for everyone.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0783225881|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for anyone who has or had a dream.  Kevin Costner portrays small town Iowa farmer, Ray Kinsella, who hears a voice urging him to build a baseball field.  The townspeople think that he's crazy, but he knows its his destiny. His wife, Annie (Amy Madigan) supports him fully at first. Ray Liotta is excellent as Shoeless Joe Jackson, who one day shows up at Ray's baseball field.  Shoeless Joe is joined by numerous baseball players from the past, who just want to have the chance to play baseball again. <br /> Ray heads out on a journey to track down writer in seclusion, Terry Mann (James Earl Jones). After a lot of hemming an hawing, Terry joins him on his qwest.  They next encounter Dr. Archibald &quot;Moonlight&quot; Graham, who is brilliantly portrayed by legendary actor Burt Lancaster.  Ray, Terry, and Dr. Graham all have a common interest, though.  They all yearn for the years past, what used to be...to have that second chance to fulfill their dreams.  <br /> **On a side note, this was one of Burt Lancaster's last screen roles before he passed away.  It was wonderful to see this accomplished actor in such a role, as the wise older physician who gave up his dreams in order to help others. This is a must see film for anyone who has not yet realized their dreams, or maybe you have - it'll bring back memories of those times.
B000002O7C|4.0|This soundtrack is pretty good, the opening track still brings chills up my spine when I listen to it and that image of connery and neil standing in the conning tower of that massive submarine.  Rousing, the russian choir is really cool. Buy this CD!
0060392886|5.0|An incredibly well written story from an equally incredible band. A shocking, hilarious, gross, anarchy filled confessional that is nearly impossible to put down once I pick it up. Includes many incredible pictures. A great read for any fan of the rock and roll lifestyle.
B000004286|5.0|The music on this CD could stand alone from the movie. Horner has put together a masterpiece collection of music. Music of the Romantic era- highly emotional and moving...pure joy! Buy this CD!!!!
0553502271|4.0|The second JG novel I read after the 'Rain Maker'. His way of character introduction is very good. Even though there are so many characters in this novel, he gives so much background information about each character and makes it easy to remember those. Also the vivid description of the pantanal is too good. I really felt like being there in the pantanal.
0345440757|5.0|I'm a first time mom who heard lots of stories and got a lot of advice from anyone and everyone but the best information I found about taking care of my baby on a daily basis was in this book. After my daughter arrived I had a hard time figuring out some of her 'moods.' I skipped naps so I could read this book and was able to determine why my baby behaved the way she did and what I could do to help make things better from meal time to nap and bed time, it was a great help to me!
B00005AR3G|5.0|Movie Summary:  Teenage Aztec Emperor Kuzco is a spoiled brat. He fires his sorceress advisor who takes it very badly. She tries to kill him but ends up turning him into a llama instead. On his own as a llama, Kuzco has only one chance for help, Pacha the man he just told he was turning his village into a swimming pool. Pacha and Kuzco have many adventures on their way back to the palace. In the end, Kuzco learns what it means to be a good person.<br />My Opinion:  This movie was a ton of fun! Our entire family loved it. It was light and funny and had a decent moral. It never got too silly or too serious. I loved how the characters made fun of a couple of the plot holes. We loved all the characters especially Kronk. He was really funny. Even though he was working for the evil Yzma you couldn't help loving him. He was never mean. He just happened to be on the wrong side. This is a great movie and DVD and should be part of your Disney collection.<br />DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic, DD 5.1 plenty of fun extras. This is a very high quality DVD.<br />What You Should Do:  Get it. This is an excellent Disney DVD. The kids will watch it over and over.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Gosh, I had a hard time rating this one. The reason is, there is not one song on this album that doesn't deserve five stars; and I would never dream of giving any other Beatles release any less than five. However, 1 really, really annoyed me. Not only is it a shameless ploy to get more money, it doesn't even do what it claims to do, which is - include every UK or US no. 1 hit, and I just don't understand how come so few people realized that. Being a Beatles freak for several years, and having read the wonderful 'Anthology' biography, I found numerous errors, which, I believe, cannot be accidential.<br />First of all, the very idea of a Beatles hits collection is enraging, because the Beatles worked wonderfully on both singles and albums, and some of their greatest albums ( Sgt. Pepper, the White Album ) contain nothing but non-single material - which is one of the things that make them so good. However nice it may be that 1 puts the Beatles back on the bestselling lists and gets young listeners to hear their great music, those young listeners may believe that 1 covers the best of the Beatles' music and thus not buy their albums. Which is really too bad.<br />1 offers a very uneven choice of songs from the different albums: Sgt. Pepper, Rubber Soul and the white album, three of the Beatles' greatest works, are ignored. Let It Be ( a good, but not great, album ), for example, gets three songs, as does Help!. Even worse is a fact I noticed only several days ago, and that is that 1 is very, very anti-John Lennon and pro-Paul McCartney, ignoring some of the Beatles best songs. I have several proofs of this:<br />1) The Beatles first single, Love Me Do, a John/Paul composition, never made it to no. 1 anywhere. Their second - Please Please Me, a song written mainly by John - did. Love Me Do is on the collection - Please Please me is NOT!<br />2) Paul's Yesterday, indeed a great song, was NEVER RELEASED AS A SINGLE! Yet it is still IN THE COLLECTION! Equally great John songs which were not singles are NOT INCLUDED!<br />3) B-sides, as a rule, are not included here and that sort of makes sense. But John Lennon's Strawberry Fields Forever, my favorite Beatles song ever, was not the B-side to Penny Lane - they were released as a double A-side. Penny Lane is IN, Strawberry Fields is OUT.<br />4) On the other hand, We Can Work It Out, Paul's B-side to Day Tripper is IN! John's Revolution, the B-side to Paul's Hey Jude, which was a much bigger hit than Work It Out, is not included.<br />If you really want a collection ( though the idea of a Beatles collection itself seems strange to me ) there is already a good one - 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 ( the red and blue albums ). These collection give a much better idea of the Beatles' career, including songs from every Beatles album. If two double albums are too much for you... Well, I guess you don't like the Beatles enough. In that case, go ahead - get 1. But do me a favor, get Sgt. Pepper or the white album too and you'll probably be hooked.
0375704027|5.0|\\" `Norwegian Wood' is still the one Murakami book that `everyone' in Japan has read,\\" says Jay Rubin in his Translator's Note of this simple, straightforward, semi-autobiographical story. Toru Watanabe as narrator of this 1960s period piece reminds me of Nick Carraway in Fitzgerald's \\"Gatsby\\"; Watanabe seems one step removed from the action even while he is part of it, and his commentary shapes a critique of contemporary Japanese society. So \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is a love story set against a larger theme of questioning the Establishment. Another theme is the characters' insouciance about lovemaking. Letterwriting and love letters are part of Murakami's (Watanabe's) narrative strategy, which lend this novel a heightened sense of intimacy. Near the end, Watanabe says, \\"Letters are just pieces of paper . . . Burn them, and what stays in your heart will stay; keep them and what vanishes will vanish.\\" Haruki Murakami's \\"Norwegian Wood\\" stays in the heart; it is his enchanting letter from the `60s, with love.
B00003CXRM|2.0|Maybe I don't like it because I was forced to see it. Then again, I rented out of free will and I still hated it.  One of my friends fell asleep during the movie because it was so boring.  The best parts were the parts with the Soggy Bottom Boys and the credits.  Now that you have my opinion I hope you might just think a little more about buying this movie, unless you really, really like it. Remember: rent before you buy, unless you saw it in theaters.  Also, just because you're friends like it dosn't mean you'll like it.
B000058T5E|4.0|I think I used to own a copy of \\"Wired\\". In high school, I listened to everything I could get my hands on, but in the late 70's I really turned toward &quot;new wave&quot;. I've been buying some older CD's to add some of my past to my collection, and just picked up Devo's &quot;Greatest Misses&quot; (it still sounds fresh!), and I picked up some early Blue Oyster Cult for nostalgic reasons, too (&quot;Astronomy&quot; is a classic tune!). <br />Somehow, I stumbled on a review of \\"You Had It Coming\\". I remembered listening to \\"Wired\\" 30 tears ago, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. Honestly, all I remembered was the title and album art. Could be that I was too young. Could be I was influenced by some funny-smelling stuff. Anyway, for some reason, I thought I'd buy this one.<br />This album leaves a lasting impression! I listen to most of my music at work through my computer, and this CD sounded fairly good. Then I took it home and had a chance to crank up the stereo when the little ones were gone. I was amazed by some of the sounds that Beck can create. <br />\\"Rollin &amp; Tumbin\\" is my favorite track, followed closely by \\"Dirty Mind\\" and \\"Rosebud\\". \\"Nadia\\" is beautiful, as other reviews have pointed out, but I like the energy of the above titles more. That energy is the key to this CD. If you like fast, vibrant music, you'll enjoy this. Keep in mind, it's very guitar-oriented...Lot's of feedback and stuff that pop purists won't appreciate. (I stuck the CD in while my wife and I were starting to paint a room. After about 20 seconds of \\"Earthquake\\", she said \\"I wonder how long I'll be able to listen to this.\\" I took the hint and took it out. Jeff starts out hard and keeps going. Needless to say, this probably won't do well with the Whitney Houston and Barry Manilow fans of the world). If you want a great album to paint to, or pay bills to, or work out to, this is worthy of a spot. <br />Maybe it's just me, but I'm not a Clapton or Page fan. I think those guys are getting too settled into old age. (Ohhh...\\"Rosebud\\" just came on...I may have to re-order my favorites!) But Beck rocks with passion for his music that still comes through the speakers. I get the sense that he still wants to learn something new, as opposed to settling down with the past and putting out...oh, maybe a blue's album or something...
0380796090|5.0|Keyes is awesome. I am in love with her books. I can't say that I liked this one better than Lucy, probably the same.  Again the first person captures you and makes you feel like you are there in the story. I was emotionally involved in this book. I hated James and then I hated Claire and then I liked her again. I would say that this books rules and is very fun to read!!!!!
B00004XONN|2.0|First of all let me point out that Radiohead is an awesome band.  I like ever album that these guys have except this one, and I haven't had the time to go out and buy Amnesiac, but i'm not optimistic.  This album is a synthesised piece of weird music.  Don't get me wrong i'm all for weird music, but I need lyrics.  What happened to the strange appocalyptic ramblings from Ok Computer, or the angst ridden vocals of The Bends.  I mean come on, expermentation is fine, but something good should come out of it.  All I hear when I put this on is some really synthesised singing along with some excedingly not Radiohead type of music.  I got one over used phrase for these guys, &quot;back to basics&quot;.  Thats what they need to do.  The survives the one star infamy because Optomistic is an excellent song.  It's one of their best.  Now heres hoping these guys can get back to what they are best at, making great alternative music.
B00005LMBK|4.0|I'm going to go out on a limb and say this will be one of the best albums of the year.  This is an album not getting much airtime, but I hope it will with some time.  When I heard Gorillaz, I had the same feeling when I first heard Beck's Odelay.  Refreshing excitement.  The music on Gorillaz blends various forms of music (hip hop, jazz, country, punk, rock, melodic pop.)  You'll find bits and pieces of such music in all the songs.<br />The concept is also great.  The group, made up of talented musicians, undergo the identity of Gorillaz, an animated group.  It gives people like Damon Albarn of Blur and others, the freedom to go out and produce some new sounding music that is very welcome in today's formulaic market.  <br />Take a listen for Clint Eastwood, the single that's circulating the States currently.  It's a great song, but don't think that the whole album will sound like some pop/hip hop tune.  You'll find a good mix of all sorts of music nearly in every song providing a nice blend for all tastes out there.  If you're looking for a new sound that fuses all the great kind of music out there, give Gorillaz a listen.
6304509154|5.0|This is a really good movie.  It is a horror/suspense.  In the movie the &quot;Poltergeist&quot; is a force thing that can move things and slam doors, rattle chains etc.  The people in the movie who built the families house built it ontop of a grave yard.  They said that they removed the graves and stuff but all they did is move the head stones.  This is why the Poltergeist is bothering the family.  You can also apparently hear the Poltergeist threw a telivision on the &quot;fuzz&quot; stations.  It is also said to be the gate way to another demension.  I really recomend this movie to all of you.
B000002KP3|2.0|I think this album's pretty weak. Most of the songs start out great but then don't go anywhere. They just end.. Like &quot;Once upon a time, there was a mean knight and a good knight. The mean was mean and the good was good, oh yeah...THE END&quot; After listening to it four five times the music got pretty bland and boring. I gave it a second listen after seeing all these marvelous reviews but it didn't get any better. If you like hearing bridgeless music that doesn't really mean anything buy this album. I don't think I get it yet.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Now that all the hype has long since died down, true fans are free to express their disappointment in this film.  George Lucas has given us his Disneyfied vision of the origins of the Empire, perfect for the &quot;ages eight and under&quot; crowd.  One would expect so much more from the creator of the original Star Wars trilogy, but apparently the twenty years in between have revealed a kindler, gentler, and much more cheesy Lucas.  (But let's face it, we all knew this would happen after seeing the singing puppets and ewoks in Return of the Jedi.)<br />The goofyness of the Phantom Menace extends far beyond what any of us dared dream.  Darth Vader invented and built C3PO?  Yep. The best CGI character they could come up with was Jar Jar Binks, a wacky slapstick sidekick who gets into trouble wherever he goes?  Hilarious.  You go it.  And let's face it, shouldn't Episode 1 start at the beginning?  I would like to know of Obi Wan's training, how he became a jedi, where Darth Maul came from, and where Yoda fit in to everything.  I could care less about the trade embargo they open the movie with.  I'm sure the &quot;eight and under&quot; crowd wasn't interested either.  <br />Perhaps in twenty more years they will make an Episode Zero that starts things off properly.  Then we can all skip this movie.
B00005JHAD|4.0|I guess if you can only do one thing, you may as well do it really well.  I'm not saying Guy Ritchie has limited talents, mind you.  I'm sure he could write and direct a ripping-good romantic comedy or an intimate costume drama.  But he hasn't yet.<br />&quot;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (LS&amp;2SB) has spent the last two years on my list of 'movies most recommended'.  It's a rocking tale, following an eclectic blend of lower-class British gangsters bumbling after precious loot.  &quot;Snatch&quot; can be described in basically the same way.  And you know what? I didn't mind the similarities.  Probably because Ritchie is that rare director (I dare say auteur) whose talents range from concocting convoluted but interesting stories, to writing iconoclast and stylish dialogue, to getting the best from his actors, to displaying a kinetic but controlled visual style.  And he does it all in one movie.  Let's not judge him on that forthcoming romantic comedy, because he hasn't made it yet.  He has made &quot;Snatch&quot;, and it's a great film.<br />A plot summary would be pointless, because trying to follow the plot here is half the fun.  Time doubles back on itself repeatedly, scenarios play out one way and then are revealed to have played out another, and the audience never really knows who has the upper hand.  &quot;Who&quot; meaning an enormous (and deliciously named) cast of characters, each doing their best to get their hand on an enormous diamond.  Needless to say its all an excuse for some ridiculous action sequences, some seriously funny (rolling on the floor laughing at times) dialogue, and several temptations of fate that leave you asking the questions: &quot;How can these guys be so stupid?&quot;<br />It's also an excuse for some seriously inventive displays of stylish virtuosity.  Ritchie employs a multitude of techniques: slow motion, quick edits, split screens, hyperactive cameras, odd angles, etc.  They never feel forced or contrived, but rather necessary.  He also pulls off some neat trickery, like filming the opening sequence entirely through the security camera monitors of a diamond shop.  Or an extended pause that studies the faces of three characters, and explains how the expression on one doesn't bode well for the baddies in pursuit.  Or the photomontage that shows Frankie Four Fingers in gambling ecstasy.  Or Cousin Avi's quickly cut Trans-Atlantic flights (which reminded me of a similar but distracting technique Darren Aronofsky utilized in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;).  Ritchie uses the whole palette at his disposal, and it's mighty fun to watch.  It should also be noted that, thankfully, the style never gets in the way of the actors.<br />Most of the acting is top notch.  Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro, and Jason Statham all bring a world-weary blend of cynicism and exhaustion to their roles.  Alan Ford and Rade Serbedzija do some top notch scenery chewing, appropriate for their malevolent characters.  Robbie Gee, Lennie James, and Ade are appealing and goofy as pawnshop owners charged with stealing the diamond.  They all combine for a fine ensemble cast, an interesting tapestry of characters.  Thank god they are all capable, because they are nearly overshadowed by two performances here that, if they had shared any screen time together, would do determined battle for the status of &quot;actor who steals the movie&quot;.<br />Vinnie Jones essentially reprises his role from LS&amp;2SB, a determined bounty hunter named 'Big Chris'.  Here, he's named 'Bullet Tooth Tony'.  The only real difference here is that Tony doesn't drag his son around to do jobs with him.  Jones is a cool customer, very low-key, matter-of-fact, and incredulous when things don't go exactly as planned.  Unfortunately, Tony comes to the story too late, and leaves too early.  I wished we could spend some more time with him.<br />Brad Pitt gets just enough screen time.  He plays a gypsy (he and his fellow &quot;Pikeys&quot;live in a trailer-park commune) boxing prodigy named 'One Punch Mickey O'Neil'.  Picture &quot;Fight Club's&quot; Tyler Durden, with an incomprehensible Irish accent (to be fair, attention and concentration will allow you to decipher just enough of Pitt's dialogue to get the gist of what he's talking about).  Here, Pitt repeatedly gets the tar beaten out of him (the boxing sequences are great fun), sports a dirty beard and greasy hair under his ever present leather hat, and appears to be having a heap of fun.  That is, until one heartbreaking scene that violently throws the movie towards its engrossing third act.<br />If run back-to-back, one would be hard-pressed to determine where LS&amp;2SBs begins, and &quot;Snatch&quot; ends.  Hopefully, Ritchie will tackle some new territory with his next projects.  But for now, he does what does extremely well, and that's really all one can ask from him.  If you liked LS&amp;2SB I can guarantee you'll like &quot;Snatch&quot; too.
B00004XQ83|5.0|With the country music airwaves currently being dominated by fresh, new artists like Faith Hill who fit better in the pop circuit, it is refreshing to see an album composed entirely of traditional bluegrass and country do as well as the soundtrack of O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU.  Even further impressing is the fact that although none of the songs were released to radio, the soundtrack was propelled to the #1 spot on Billboard's country album charts solely from people hearing the music in the movie theater.  This soundtrack is a phenomenal album that is proof to country fans everywhere that although traditional country has appeared to have gone out of style, it is still very much alive and well.<br />The O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU SOUNDTRACK is composed of nineteen songs recorded by some of the most talented country/bluegrass artists in the business, including Gillian Welch (who also served as musical director for the motion picture), Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, and the Cox Family, and and is truly a gathering of musical talent.  Also included in the soundtrack is music by musicians who appeared in the film as well as working on the CD, such as the Whites and Tim Blake Nelson.<br />The O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU SOUNDTRACK is truly, as the CD ads claim, &quot;The ULTIMATE American roots collection!&quot;  So, grab your acoustic guitar, fiddle, and Dapper Dan hair pomade, and let the soundtrack from O BROTHER take you on a journey through one of the greatest periods in country music history.
B00003CXRP|4.0|This movie could have been much better.  Its really only interesting when Chuck Noland's(Tom Hanks) Plane crashs and he has to survive on a desert island by himself.  The movie is beleivable.  If your buying the movie because you think its a nice movie about survival on a harsh desert island then dont because even though thats included you have to deal with the depressing moments when Chuck returns home and the dissapointing ending.  If the movie kept you on the island more and at least had a satisfying ending it could have been perfect.
B00004XOWM|4.0|This CD has a few good songs on it (Rollin, Generation, MI2 theme) but it is not as good as the other two
B00005KFUN|5.0|MUSE's last album got the NME best new artist award, which featured the fantastic single &amp; video 'Muscle Museum'. &quot;Origins of Symmetry&quot; once again sets this trio apart from the 'others'. New songs include &quot;Plug in Baby&quot;, with its 'Metal-Like' guitar intro and riff, as well as &quot;Bliss&quot;, with its delicate piano/synth intro to fabulous MUSE-esque guitar and Matt Bellamy vocals. With a CD-full of fabulous B-Sides from &quot;Showbiz&quot; in-between this 2nd LP, these three show that they are far from stopping at any level.  (Hate this &amp; I'll love you)...
B00003CXQY|3.0|The movie was enjoyable and fun, even if it was a little on the light side.  I was disappointed in the extras on the second disc, however.  There's really not too much there, and given that the movie on disc one is short (under 80 minutes, I believe), there really should have been no problem fitting all of the second disc extras on disc one.  As it stands, the bonus material pales in comparison to other Disney multi-disc sets, such as A Bug's Life, Tarzan, Toy Story and Fantasia.  Unless you absolutely have to have the paltry extras, save your money and pick up the single disc edition.
B000051VWW|3.0|I like Sade, will continue to support her efforts, she just needs to come back with that same production sound that made her famous so many years ago.  Only feeling a few songs on this joint.  Missing that musical magic that is needed to support a vocalist with a unique and beautiful soul stirring voice.
0345440757|5.0|The author speaks to me as an elder to a youth.  In other words, she takes the voice of an older, more experienced woman and describes her method of taking care of a baby, any little human being. I learned how to read my baby.  She describes pratical views on feeding, sleeping, activity, scheduling, pacifiers, and taking care of yourself. Just as with other advice, take what you need and leave the rest. As a first time mom, I have little idea of how to take care of a baby with no guidence from my mother who has dementia and a mother in law far away. Therefore, I intend to take what I need from this book. Basically, it teaches you how to read YOUR baby, how to pay attention and in general, what the signs mean.  To label this book as dangerous is exaggeration it. For instance, the author never says to NEVER let your baby sleep on your chest, just not ALWAYS! Hogg is not an extremist, who can be when it comes to babies? For a working mom, and those of us with no idea how to take care of a baby, this is a great book! However, don't make it the only book you read and take the advice of YOUR lactation consultant and doctor first.  However, for all praticality's sake, this book and my lactation consultant were my best friends that first month!!!
B00000FBRE|2.0|If you have heard that lagwagon is good and want to buy a cd don't get this one.  It is very whiny ... .  There are some good ones, but it is mainly a very annoying cd.  After getting this cd I will never buy another lagwagon cd because they have changed their style from punk to whiny, ..., wannabe-punk.  If your looking for a good lagwagon cd purchase Double paladium cuz that's a great album.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|This film has one of the greatest cast ever essembled. From Sean Connory to Ryan Phillippe, each actor gives an outstanding performance. Its follows four women thru their lives and current relationships, whether it be marriage or a new boyfriend. It basically about how no relationship is going to be perfect, no matter how much you love each other. This flim seems so real at times, it feels like a documentary. You almost feel like your voyuering in their lives. I recommend this film for at least a rental, form your own opinion. Maybe you will have the same love for this film as I do.
B000002UC5|5.0|This is his first solo album.  A lot of the songs feel like they could have been on Let It Be.  &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; is one of Paul's greatest songs, Beatles or otherwise, and it's worth the cost just for that song.  But the rest of the CD is good too.
0671027344|5.0|Undoubtly a beautiful, touching and real novel. One of the most sincre, honest and true books I've ever read or anyone could ever read about high school. Its beautifully straight-forward, it shows you the absolute pain in life and the utter beauty in simple things. This novel is definitly a novel to make you both laugh and cry. Its got to be one of the most touching and heartwarming stories ever. You will fall in love with Charlie and his story, You will feel infinite.
0553106635|4.0|The series kept me riveted.  The first two books wove the tale and the third was the climax; but left you saying...&quot;there has to be a fourth!&quot;  Excellent read!  I highly recommend this series.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|First off, Great Movie. Great Soundtrack.  The mixes on the soundtrack are quite good (aside from Beck's &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;).  However in a movie so replete with music (very much like Baz Luhrmann's &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;) there needs to be a second volume to pick up the extra numbers like &quot;Spectacular! Spectacular!&quot; &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; and most importantly the two huge musically challenging and totally amazing conglomarations of layered tunes.  I'm speaking of the first time inside the Moulin Rouge where &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; &quot;Because we Can&quot; &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot; are all sung AT THE SAME TIME and secondly the !!FINALE!!  &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; isn't really the closing number nor is &quot;Nature Boy&quot;.  However the Montage Finale featuring the characters singing their respective songs is needed to provide closure because nothing ties the soundtracks songs together at all.  The Finale begins with a reprise of &quot;Come What May&quot; goes into &quot;Your Song&quot; &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; and &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot;.  &quot;Nature Boy&quot; is more of an epilogoue.  But YAY GREAT MOVIE
B00003CX5P|1.0|I went expecting a continuation of the gritty, flawed, &quot;deep&quot; star wars we all grew up on.  <br />Instead we got a wise cracking, THING that did nothing but distract from the other characters.  An empty storyline that relied on flash and dazzle more than on real character development or a well thought out plot.<br />Very dissapointing. Only good thing I have to say is maybe now Lucas will release the original 3 episodes on DVD!
B00005B4GU|5.0|I recently watched Grant Gee's stunning experimental documentary about Radiohead entitled, &quot;Meeting People Is Easy,&quot; which provides a fascinating glimpse of Thom Yorke as a musician (and I don't use this term lightly) desperately trying to cling to his very real notions of artistic integrity. Yorke is clearly a man who does not feel comfortable with all of the trappings of fame and who is tortured by the increasingly formidable barriers that his band's popularity has erected between himself and his vision of where Radiohead's music should go. <br />Critics and fans like to easily categorize each of Radiohead's very distinct albums as merely being their attempt to throw people off and see what new things they can do as a band. However, Yorke himself has stated that their musical shifts have come more from a desperate need to keep the band together than from any whimsical desire to laugh in the face of expectations. What it comes down to is that Radiohead is a band that continues to make music because of their own essential need to do so, and not as some shallow, artificial reaction or answer to popular and critical success. <br />Amnesiac, the band's fifth album, is strewn with Yorke's increasingly numb, pained voice and ambiguous lyrics as he delves into issues such as midlife crisis (Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box), suicide (Pyramid song), divorce (Amnesiac/Morning bell), and avarice (Dollars &amp; cents). As typical of Radiohead, they tackle these heady issues with raw emotional honesty, subtlety and grace, and in a very undidactic manner. <br />It is obvious to anyone who listens carefully to each of their five albums that Yorke's voice progressively changes with the sound of the band; the clarity of the lyrics and statements in Pablo Honey sound nothing like the barely coherent, faintly comprehensible crooning that we get in Amnesiac. In a recent interview, Yorke hinted that the changes in the band's music have been a reflection of his gradualdisinterest in the sounds afforded by standard guitars and drums. Getting the rest of the band to agree to the new &quot;electronic&quot; direction that Radiohead has been taking was no small feat for Yorke, but once everything fell into place, the end result was nothing less than brilliance. Critical reviews of Kid A and Amnesiac have placed far too much emphasis on lyrics. Sure, Radiohead has something to say, but it is becoming more and more clear that they want to say it through their elaborately constructed soundscapes rather than through words. They are not content with simply telling a story; they want to create a whole new world, a world that their listeners can immerse themselves in and allow themselves to dissolve into. Indeed, as quite evident in Amnesiac, Yorke's voice has all but disintegrated into these vast and gloomy musical vistas; essentially, his voice has become another instrument -- another invention borne from the genius of Radiohead.
6305265488|4.0|Well, this is not really the drum I march to, but even Charles Dickens had a fondness for &quot;Little Red Riding Hood.&quot; In some ways, this movie was a very bold effort. It took the classic story 'Cinderella,' and not only improved greatly on it, but left it within the boundaries of plausibility. The scenery is either gentle or spectacular at times, but always great! Barrymore is a well developed character. Her love for her father is made clear; she does her work as a servant with dignity; later she takes a dare to help a servant she cares about; when she falls in love, she dares to break a few rules; and she even falls into deep sorrow as well as deep rages at times. Most of the secondary characters are well handled. Henry is wonderful as a prince who develops humanly and morally. His parents are also handled well. They are disturbed by his growing desire for independence; they have clever one liners; ('I shall deny you the crown and live forever.'); they prove flexible as parents; they are given the pleasure of seeing parents stranger than they;  and they rise to prove heroes in the end! Leonardo Da Vinci is handled not only greatly, but humanly as well. In a work of fiction, it can be a charming bonus to throw in some characters who really did exist. Leonardo's character not only makes demands on our admiration, but he also reveals to us he is human. (A certain term used in a conversation with Prince Henry will tell us that!) The 'Cinderella' basis was heavily improved upon. One stepsister is bad, but the other is good. The good stepsister is memorable. She is very gentle; she shows herself to be virtuous; and she helps rise to give us a happy ending. My only complaint about this whole movie is that the wicked stepmother and stepsister are not as well handled as they could have been. They are quite repulsive throughout the movie. Also, there is nothing redeeming in them that allows us to see them as human. Charles Dickens was usually careful not to do this.He either put enough redeeming qualities in his villains so we could see them as human (Alfred Jingle, Fagin, Bradley Headstone), or he used so much energy in making them so wicked and evil, that they were more fascinating than repulsive (Daniel Quilp, John Chester, Uriah Heep). But aside from that, this movie is a wonderful treasure. Buy this video. It will be some of the best money you ever spend.
B00005BCPC|3.0|This is worth seeing if only for the excellent performances of Frances O'Connor and Justine Waddell, although she was in it very little. As for the story its self, and its loyalty to the book, judge for yourself. I also highly recommend &quot;Bedazzled&quot;, which pertains to Frances, and the English miniseries &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot;, if you wish to see Justine at her best.
B00005LB9O|4.0|The most frustrating thing about a band like travis, is that they a more often than not, dismissed for less.  Travis and Fran Healey are not the a-typical talented rock band, they are much much more.  The songs are timeless, the lyrics witty, and the melodies come-off as the effortless humming of a master songsmith.  No, Travis is not the next Beatles (Buy neither was about a million other bands - including Oasis), but their approach certainly holds a rarely understood musical approach that seems to elude the majority of songwriters today.  <br />The Invisible Band is a little more light than The Man Who.  Somewhat more straight forward and positive.  There are several gems here that will haunt you in your sleep.  You will wake-up humming these songs.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this movie, is the best i had ever seen, but i was a bit dissapointed with the DVD, even though the trailer was great, and so are the sound and picture quality, i wanted a  DTS track, but i wouldn't be able to hear the japanese and french tracks, and the making of documentary was not very infformative, i wish that in the future Disney releases a DTS version, but many DVD's now have a DTS track, and they sure have a lot features, let's say um the &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;, &quot;Chicken Run&quot; and &quot;The Lost World&quot; DVD's?...,they have three languages and everything, well anyways Dolby Digital sounded preety good here.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I in reality give it ***1/2 stars, even though it was good, it had really good acting, a great plot, great FX and it was very thrilling, i didn't enjoy it as much as the original triology, also i didn't like that the technology of the spaceships is a lot more advanced than in the original one, i didn't hate Jar Jar Binks, i sort of liked him and disliked him, but anyways is a good movie, and i hope that the DVD comes with a  DTS track, i have an amplifier with that purpouse and of course i buyed my  DVD Player, not only to buy this one, but the original triology.
6305531412|5.0|Not only is Jessica the sexiest woman ever, the movie actually gives a little insite to life in Los Angeles during the time before the freeway system we all know. Most people didnt know LA actually did have a great mass transit system at one time so even though this movie pokes fun at a lot of things it is based on some truths. the coupling of Disney and Warner Bros cartoons was also a first, Mickey and Bugs in the same scene. and did I mention Jessica?

0930289455|5.0|Commissioner Gordon gets a real shock-surprise when oneday his doorbell rings and when his daughter, Barbara (Batgirl), opens the door she is imediately shot by the Joker. The Joker kidnaps Gordon, leaving Barbara behind in a puddle of blood, and traps him in his personal circus. He is out to prove to the world that in essence everybody can be driven as mad as he himself is without even having to push very hard. This book is a milestone in the Batman continuity and has left a legacy to every Bat storyline since. Alan Moore is, like always, very up for the job and the great artwork by Brian Bolland isn't exactly awful either. Although I think it's a bit overhyped this book it surely makes for a good read.
0380788624|4.0|After I picked this book up, I did not put it down for 7 hours. I started at 8 at night, and stopped at 2 in the morning. Then I read the last little bit at 10 in the morning. This book IS that good. You will not want to put it down.     The story has two major plot lines, one set in WW II, the other in 'A dark day after tomorrow' as the blub puts it. This is, by the way, a ridiculous description. There is nothing in Stephenson's undefinied 'present' that is darker that the reality of the late 90s. Maybe the publishers wanted it to sound spooky, I don't know. Anyway, a detailed description of the plot is largely unnecessary. The plot is not the point, and it is slightly incoherent in any case.     What makes this book great is the way Stephenson writes. Now, this style is not for everyone. If you hate William Gibson or didn't like Catch-22, you probably won't like this book. Otherwise, its a joy. The difficult thing about it is that its all written in the present tense, giving it a stream-of consciousness feel. Once you get over the initial weirdness, though, you can see that it fits the atmosphere that Stephenson is trying to create.    My personal favourite in this book are the bizzarre digression that Stephenson goes on. 2 pages on how to best eat captain crunch cereal. 5 pages, including graphs, calculating how long it will take for horniness to completely impair one's ability to think. Some of the more intensely mathematical of these digressions can be difficult for people with little talent for calculus (like me), but I still found them amusing.    I have two and only two negatives to express. One, the 'villian', if that is what he is supposed to be, is ridiculous. Andrew Loeb's role is left undefined throughout the novel, and his appearance towards the end is bizzare and somewhat incomprehensible. The ending itself is the other problem. It seems like the publisher told Stephenson that he wasn't allowed to go over 1000 pages, so he just stopped writing then and their. Some of this may be explained by rumors of a sequel, but the ending still didn't quite fit.     Many other people believe the book is also too long. I would deny this. The rambling, twisting nature of 'Cryptonomicon' is at the heart of its charm; to shorten it would be to lessen it. So just sit back, reserve several hours, and enjoy.
B00005BJPO|3.0|Ok, I've seen this movie, and countless other Anime out there. I've noticed people really cling to this film for reasons I think I might understand. For one, alot of people new to the Anime genre are recommended this film first, so they'll love this movie the best no matter what else you show them, they started with it. The animation is yes, very good for it's time. The story was gripping and the violence was decent. However don't run around saying this movie was the best. Somebody here said, &quot;The best animation they ever saw.&quot; or something around that text, and if that's the case, stop watching this film 5 times a day and buy something else, because their are films out there now that people don't bother to even look at that make this film look sorry.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Most of the problems of this film have probably been covered in other reviews, but anyway...<br />The film tells you almost everything and shows you nothing, simply poor filmaking.  We should see many of the things spoken of in clearly illustrated ways, instead I'm supposed to buy it because Lucas wrote it down.  Get real.<br />And what did Lucas write down?  Drivel.  A filmaker with that little talent should not be allowed near a word processor.  Hire a good writer for gods sake.  He doesn't know how people talk, or how emotions work evidently.  Too much time spent leering at special F/X I guess.<br />Speaking of special effects, how can a man who owns IL&amp;M and has more money than he knows what to do with, has more time to perfect this film than any other director would be given, and manages to produce effects that are subpar.  Another problem is that they're the equivalent of a run on sentence, they punctuate nothing.<br />The racial stereotypes are pretty plain to me, it just seems thoughtless.<br />Two things I can give this movie as a plus.  The score, and the lightsaber duel is the best ever in a SW movie, not the best swordplay ever mind you, but for SW it was great.
6304493681|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, but I was still skeptical because I had no idea what to expect, so I rented it. Most people said it was good and hard to understand so you had to watch it at least 3 times to fully get it.  I disagree it was a fairly decent movie (I'm kind of glad I didn't buy it) but it's not all that great (it's okay), plus I understood exactly what was going on the first time.  I would suggest renting this movie before buying it because you might love it and you might hate it.  But what's really cool about this movie is that you can see that The Matrix got a lot of ideas out of it.  But anyway, I suggest renting it.
B000002JNJ|4.0|Ok, this was pantera's first album off of the glam [stuff]. Even traces of glam are found inside the album with dime's name being \\"Diamond Darrel\\", this repeats again in \\"Vulgar display of Power\\". To most this album is a must have. So lets take a look at the musical content. The first and title track \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" is a great metal song not so fast but at a somewhat high tempo. I beleive this song has the best written lyrics on the album. From there the album gets better with catchy coruses, if you listen to psycho holiday you will know what i mean. after domination the album gets less diverse. It make you think \\"what song am I on now?\\". But once you reach the song \\"The Sleep\\" it gets much much better. Then Pantera closes the Album with \\"The art of shredding\\". This song is a masterpeice. So in closing if you are a true metal fan or think you are, your not until you own a copy of \\"Cowboys from Hell\\".

B000002KIT|5.0|The fabulous \\"Live And Dangerous\\" album captures the hard rockin', hard livin' Thin Lizzy at the pinnacle of their powers.  After early success with a one-off single, \\"Whisky In The Jar\\", in 1972, things had reached a nadir during a tour of Germany. After certain guitarists who were hired in order to replace original guitarist Eric Bell had not worked out, the main song- writer, bass player and showman extraordinaire, Phil Lynott, along with his Irish colleague Brian Downey, considered throwing in the towel. However, the arrival of the ultra cool American Scott Gorham along with Scottish wild man Brian Robertson soon sorted things out and Thin Lizzy started their meteoric rise to the very top of the rock tree.  After five increasingly successful albums, they set out on a world tour (supported by the up and coming Graham Parker &amp; The Rumour) which culminated in three sold out shows at the Hammersmith Odeon, London.  What shows they were too! On `Live &amp; Dangerous' you get the entire set as it was performed. After the release there was a lot of back-biting about the fact that a lot of the bum notes were smoothed over by a production studio and that some of the solos were overdubbed. But let's face it, if it improves the overall enjoyment of the music, who cares? The way these guys moved on stage, it is hardly surprising if the odd note was missed.  The set starts with the perfect opener in \\"Jailbreak\\", with wailing sirens and the audience impatiently chanting the band's name. Then the band come thumping in with the hard rock beat, and Phil Lynott informing the masses, \\"that tonight we're going to have a Jailbreak, tonight there's going to be trouble, some of us won't survive\\". Then, the twin lead guitars are let loose. This band needed stage ramps as no stage was too big to keep them contained. Before the next song Phil Lynott asks the audience, in his thick Irish brogue, \\"Is there anybody here with any Irish in them? Are there any girls who like a little more Irish in them\\"?  The band rip through five more songs, including \\"Dancing in the Spotlight\\", with the fabulous John Earle on sax. They then slow it down for the heartbreaking love song, \\"Still In Love With You\\". With Phil Lynott singing his own words about the one-sided break up of a relationship, this song gives the guitarists space to really show their stuff in two emotional solos.  But from that point on, it is Hell-raising Rock `n' Roll all the way. Phil Lynott wrote some classic songs and they are all here. From the pop of Top Ten single, \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\", to the heavy metal of \\"Suicide\\", the music then climaxes with the band throwing themselves into the motorbike anthem, \\"The Rocker\\", by which time the audience has been brought up to an absolute frenzy.  The next time you have to make a long car journey buy this album and put it on your player. You'll arrive at your destination in half the time and then stay sitting in the car to listen to just one more song.  By 1983 Thin Lizzy were gone and two years later Phil Lynott was taken from us permanently. However, listen to their legacy, it will never be bettered.  Thin Lizzy's `Live &amp; Dangerous' stood for what rock music is supposed to be all about - a good night out. Mott the Dog.Irish in them\\"?

B00003CXB2|5.0|I really can't say anything about this movie that hasn't been said before. I'm very pleased with the quality of the DVD and I feel like it brings the movie to life. I've always loved the old epics that they made in the fifties and sixties. This is one of the best ones. While it may seem a little dated by todays standards (i.e. the violence is too neat and the technical details are off such as the Turks using American machine-guns etc.) it's well acted, intelligently written and beautiful to look at. My wife bought this copy for me as a suprise and what a great suprise it was. I do believe that's all I can say. Enjoy.
0767802519|5.0|REVIEWER'S NOTE:  Here is another review that my son wrote:<br />This one movie, Leon, is absouloutely beautiful. And I'll tell you why. Leon (Jean Reno), the best of the best of his profession, cleaning, which is being a hit-man, has always been the dark, yet mysterious type. Leon is always being sent out by Tony of the New York Mafia, to clean situations. Right next door to him, is a girl named Mathilda (Natilie Portman), who is always being abused by her family and step-family. Mathilda always liked Leon, although never knowing what he did for a living. She did know he liked milk, so she went out to get some for him. 2 quarts. Her dad, being a drug dealer, had to report to--of course-- a drug lord. But when the drug lord (played masterfully by Gary Oldman) finds out that Mathilda's dad's drugs are not 90% pure, when the day before they were 100%, he gives him 1 day to bring it back to 100% again. Well, we are back now to when Mathilda got the 2 quarts of milk for Leon. While she is gone, the drug lord and his connies, arrive. What happens next sets up most of the story. The movie is emotional, gripping, exciting and incredibly intelligent, also with amazing acting. 5 stars!

The author replays what happened in the Ia Drang Valley, minute by minute as told by the soldiers who fought there...on both sides.  This is definitely going to become a classic.  What I like about the book is the author tells the story the way it was, without the sideline drama.  You definitely feel as though you are transported back into the steaming jungles of the Ia Drang Valley.  I would recommend this book to anyone that appreciates military history.  This is a must read.
0767836324|5.0|While I've read negative reviews of this movie, I imagine they were written by pirates.  My sons' first saw this movie when they were 2 and 4, which began a love affair that has yet to end.  At 8 and 10, they still love it.  For children it has action, adventure, a terrifically evil Captain Hook, and a happy ending.<br />For adults it's visually stunning. The attention to detail not only in the sets but also in the story itself will keep you watching again and again to pick up things that you may have missed the first 40 or 50 times.  My favorite part is Captain Hooks explination of &quot;Why parents hate their children&quot;. (&quot;I want a party, I want a cookie, I want, I want, I want!!!!!) While I don't &quot;hate&quot; them, there are times I can relate!<br />Keep an eye out for cameo's by Phil Collins, David Crosby, Glenn Close, and a pre-famous Gweneth Paltrow.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Gilligan's Island was a cute show, but CASTAWAY is the real thing and a great movie.  It is a change from the seven stranded castaways, for Robert Zemeckis simply threw the &quot;cast away&quot; and rode the waves with Tom Hanks.  The Gilligan's Island jingle could have gone something like this:<br />The plane set down in the ocean somewhere, Near an uncharted Pacific Isle, With Tom Hanks, and Wilson too, the millionaire, Tom Hanks, The movie star (Tom Hanks), the Professor (Hanks), and Hanks again, Here on Tom Hanks' Isle!<br />So much for my parodic attempt to be funny, but it is true.  If you like Tom Hanks, whom I do, you will love this movie.  Only Russell Crowe's outstanding performance in Gladiator prevented Hanks from holding the golden statue again.  He plays the part of a FedEx consultant, Chuck Noland, who often travels across the world on business, yet one day meets peril on a flight across the Pacific.  He winds up on an island, and this is where the survival story ensues, not only for Chuck, but for the movie as well.  An actor on an island must be very creative, especially with little background music, no conversation, and only natural sound effects like the wind, rain, and waves.<br />The real question is why Helen Hunt accepted the role of Chuck's girlfriend, Kelly, a limited one in this movie.  Excuse me, but is this &quot;As Good as it Gets&quot; for her?  They must have paid a good nickel to secure her services, but she certainly made the most of her part; nevertheless, the best supporting actor goes to Wilson. This is Chuck's wild-haired, blood brother, and confidant, the person that kept him from losing all his mental faculties.  In fact, Tom had a ball with this little fellow and you will be impressed with his performance.<br />The movie reveals to us the importance of the human relationship. Can a person live alone in life as on an island?  Do we need others to survive and to what extremes will mankind go to have connection with another human being?  The movie answers these questions, and even brings God into the picture.  Do we really have angels watching over us?  Thus, the movie deals with some very real and delicate human issues, issues that we cannot so easily &quot;cast away&quot;!er human being?  The movie answers these questions, and even brings God into the picture.  Do we really have angels watching over us?  Thus, the movie deals with some very real and delicate human issues, issues that we cannot so easily &quot;cast away&quot;!
0440219078|4.0|&quot;The Giver&quot;by Lois Lowry is a story about an eleven year old boy who lives in a community where life is totally different to life in our world.He is called Jonas and he,like all the other members of the community doesn't know that there is another reality.But then Jonas learns about the differences between the community and the outside world and he comes to an important decision for himself and the community. Although the story is a science fiction story I really liked it.The story seems less unrealistic as it seems at first sight.It makes you think about the problems of progress and genetic manipulation without seeming to be a warning.The resder likes to read the book chapter by chapter in order to experience something new.Life is described in details and the reader can form a clear picture what life in the community is like and what the different characters in the book are feeling.The story has an open ending.The reader doesn't really get to know what happens to Jonas or the community.I would have liked to know it but this ending only makes you hope that everything changes for the better.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|At the Drive-In is an extremely talented band. While comparisons will be made to Rage Against the Machine, ATDI is completely original. When (or if) you figure out what the lead singer is saying, you will realize what true lyrical brillinace this band posesses. The guitar work is amazing. ATDI is capable of fast, adrenaline filled songs and also slower, almost eerie ballad types. The whole album is packed with so much energy and emotion. It is captivating from the first song to the last.  Pure Genius.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Muse - oh, they're that band that sounds like Radiohead, aren't they? Fortunately, on Origin of Symettry, no. Showbiz was good, but Origin of Symettry Muse have moved on. They have created a much more vivid soundscape which is as overblown as it is creative as it is brilliant. Not even the two singles could have prepared you for this. <br />The album opens with second single New Born. Whilst first single Plug In Baby was good, New Born is amazing. It is totally overblown in a rock opera sort of way and is one of the standout tracks on the album.<br />Next is Bliss, rumoured to be the third single from the album. It opens with what sounds like a harp, which mutates into an electronic keyboard. This plays a totally wild arpeggio, before the drums kick in and this arpeggio combined with the guitars and drums makes it totally euphoric. The end of the chorus is totally haunting, and one the second chorus the arpeggio gets a solo, then then it builds beautifully. The whole effect is another stand out track, as it ends with the harp again.<br />Space Dementia follows. Whilst New Born and Bliss are both quite experimental, this is the first tracks which is hard to get into. The piano opens it like a classical piece, showing this influence in their music, and another arpeggio, but on a classical piano begins. However heavier guitars and drums give it a totally different sound to Bliss. Whilst Bliss is euphoric, Space Dementia is extremely down, with lyrics like 'You make me sick/Because I adore you so'. Get into it however and you will find it is yet another brilliant track. It is also very overblown and ends with a spacey sound, accompanied with a slow grunge instrumental.<br />Hyper Music is next. It starts with some heavy distortion and gothically chilling singing from Matt. However once it starts fully it turns out to be very catchy. The high Gothic singing continues. It sounds like a chorus is starting and it sounds very experimental. However it is really just like a different type of verse. The whole thing is excellent. Matt screams at one point, which is something he never did on Showbiz.<br />It flows right into Plug In Baby, the first single from the album. In fact the whole album seems to flow. Plug In Baby is totally infectious but not as deep as some of the other tracks. The mad fast guitar solo gives it a characteristic style. It sounds like one of the best tracks from Showbiz rather than one of the best on Origin of Symettry however. Which is still very good.<br />Sixth is the art-rock masterpiece that is Citizen Erased. It sounds nearly exactly the same live and has a very live sound. This is probably, although difficult to get into, the best song on the album. It is over 7 minutes long and is like a Bohemian Rhapsody for the new generation. The vocals and lyrics are amazing. The dischord and distortion is so effective at the beggining, followed by a wonderful verse. Guitars and organ combine with worryingly catchy gothic style vocals in the chorus. The haunting last note continues through the quiet bit and a plaintive guitar solo follows. The vocals come back in, softer this time.  The chorus is done again in a much softer setting, but the bass is quietly building and the mad guitar that open the song return. Then a mad guitar solo kicks in, and its absolutely crazy sound make for one of the best ever. The twangy quiet guitar comes in, accompanied by spacy sounds (they're now making a habit of these) and Matt's chilling 'ooh's'. This is beauty!<br />The spacey sound fades out into a song that sounds exactly like Bliss, but only for a moment. It is Micro Cuts, and is also brilliant. The vocals are very distorted and high. The chorus is overblown. The vocals are impossible to make out and when Matt hits top note it resounds at a pitch a woman couldn't make. The vocals really are opera style here - something Matt is making a habit out of. However it sounds like he's taking the (...)out of opera, as it is accompanied by prog-rock guitars. Another masterpiece.<br />Next is Screenager, which features the welcome return of Latin guitars, like the ones in Muscle Museum. Another beautiful chilling melody. There is the fourth electronic arpeggio of the album in the chorus, however it still sounds equally individual. Harp is also used. This is one of the lighter tracks on the album.<br />Dark Shines sounds like a guitar-fuelled disco song at the begginning as they turn to the drum machine. Spacey sounds build however and we get a typically rocky muse chorus that sounds like the style of Cave, but with more offbeat drums. There is then a guitar solo that sounds like an electric violin playing a latin melody. We return to the dancey drums and bass, and its only Matt's vocals which stop us feeling the groove totally. Another masterpiece. Builds into a weird guitar solo before changing entirely, having a short guitar and vocals burst which sounds like a new song and ending.<br />Next is the cheeky cover 'Feeling Good'. However they take this jazz classic and make it their own, in a jazz rock way which is reminiscent of parts of Showbiz. They use guitars amazing, especially the one that floats like the piano in the original. It really sounds like Muse wrote it, and is the most transforming cover I've ever heard that worked. It is driven on with the drums and an ominous bass line which give it a pounding, depressed, slow grunge feel which takes the (...)out of the uplifting lyrics of Nina Simone. However the piano returns it to jazz. There is then a very weird distorted vocal section before returning to the main song.<br />Final track  Megalomania has a long, down intro before adding a sound that sounds like workers working on a steel railroad, which makes it sound scarily like The Intense Humming Of Evil by the Manics. However the similarity ends here. Ominous organ leads into a chorus which is both down and uplifting at the same time. The song is a beauty.<br />In conclusion, there really isn'ta bad track on this album. Muse have put so much effort into it, and it hasn't gone to waste. One of the best albums ever. Now all I need to do is see them live - their TV performances and live reviews promise much.
B00003CWNR|4.0|This is a very unique movie... to me it is a one of a kind! Here are the major points I admired:<br />1. First, the actors were very convincing. Their facial expressions, emotions and interactions were brilliant. I loved the most the acting of Tobey Maguire, he face was perfect for the character of Homer.<br />2. The story is a mix between the daily life of adorable orphans, father figure and a light love story.<br />3. I admired the on going sacrifices of the Doctor he made to the orphans and his sincere feelings.<br />The only issue that I'd stay against is the abortion concept in the film. But if you take it as a part of the story, you'd love it. I recommend watching this movie..! But I assume the book would be much more fascinating.
B000000WFU|5.0|I first heard this album in NIA class.  The combination of  the music and the movement touched my soul.  I actually wept in class.  I came home and immediately bought the CD.
B00003CXAR|5.0|Jaws is one of those movies that is ALWAYS entertaining to watch, no matter how many times you watch it.  I have to see at least part of it every time I pass it on TV.<br />The fear factor is always there in this movie.  The shark appears out of the deep unexpectedly, and still makes you jump.  But the suprising part of this film is the humor.  Bordy pulling up his shirt of look at his appendix scar when Quint and Hooper are showing off their scars.  &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot;  Hooper making faces at Quint behind his back.  Very well acted by all parties, and what can you say about Speilberg's direction?  It is all very human.  Quints telling about the story of the USS Indianapolis is one of the greatest speeches in any movie, emotionally powerful.<br />The Widescreen DVD is incredible.  The print is clear, and the sound clean.  The extras on the disc are a great asset, and only make a great movie better after watching them.  A definite buy for anyone who likes movies.<br />5 stars for sure
B000002MFN|5.0|Many would consider this album Madonna's first concept album. This is where she really pushed people's buttons. The album deals with the taboo subject of sex, she's saying its ok to talk about it, its a part of life. The album just happens to have some of her most compelling songs on it. Take the first single, the title track, or the reminiscent Deeper and Deeper. Those are two definite standouts here. The album deals with rather explicit material, hence the explicit lyrics. On the flipside there are wonderful ballads that Madonna fans have come to love, such as Bad Girl and Rain. There is something for everyone here, just listen and forget about the controversy, behind it there is the message which is undeniable. Check out other standouts on the album such as Waiting, Secret Garden, Why's It So Hard and In This Life. The whole album is excellent. See for yourself.
B000002GF8|5.0|With the release of &quot;Every Breath You Take - The Classics&quot;, buying Police albums has become a much less favorable endeavor. I'll be the first to admit, the Police had brilliant singles, and pointless, irking album filler tracks. If you buy &quot;The Classics&quot;, you get &quot;King of Pain&quot; (all-time fav Police song), &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot;, and of course the title track. Why buy &quot;Synchronicity&quot;?<br />Although it's apparent coherency pales in comparison to the brilliant concept album &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;, &quot;Synchronicity&quot; still has great depth. As a whole it sounds more mature and sophisticated than previous Police albums (there's no &quot;Canary in a Coalmine&quot; or &quot;Hungry For You&quot; here). Of course it's got the excellent three previously mentioned singles. In addition it's got catchy (and witty) songs such as &quot;Synchronicity I&quot; and &quot;Miss Gradenko&quot;, biting cynicism such as &quot;Oh My God&quot; and &quot;Walking in Your Footsteps&quot;, and simply beautiful songs like &quot;Tea in the Sahara&quot;.<br />In particular, &quot;Synchronicity II&quot; is a brilliant satire of everyday life (I think it would have fit well with &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;, which could have used a few more great songs on it). What a perfect illustration of synchronicity (I love the bit about his eyeball aching). &quot;Murder By Numbers&quot; is another satire. I still remember the first time I listened to it, I was totally bewildered at what the crazy song was about till the last verse, at which I couldn't help but laugh. A very subtle and patient song, I love it!<br />&quot;Mother&quot;, the most stupid, unmelodic, deranged, and horrific song ever written. It is painful just to hear it. Does it even count as a song? As I was pondering this one day, I discovered something even more perverse, I actually enjoyed listening to it. I'm not saying this horrible phenomenon might happen to anyone else, but I just thought you should know.<br />The Police's best album (or at least the most enjoyable), &quot;Synchronicity&quot; is a must buy for anyone who loves &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot;, which I think typifies the album. It's got a haunting melody, very intelligent (and yet beautiful) lyrics, and an expansive atmosphere. And hey, you can always skip over &quot;Mother&quot;.
B000002LND|5.0|Not many people would admit it, but most people have this cd. Why? Because it is such an excellent retrospective of Madonna's 80's hits (with a few missing). Plus it has 2 excellent tracks, Justify My Love and Rescue Me. All the big hits are here, Like A Prayer, Papa Don't Preach, Vogue, La Isla Bonita, Cherish, Express Yourself, Borderline, Holiday, Crazy For You, Like A Virgin, Lucky Star, Live To Tell and more. This is the cd you want if you are a new fan, or if you just want to relive those golden 80's moments.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I saw the Clint Eastwood video two months ago on MTV2.  I recognized the power underground hip-hop artist, Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, as Russel's possessed ghost's voice.  I found out the Automator was one of the main producers of Gorillaz.  It's a must have.  Couldn't wait for the US release, so I bought it from Canada, wished I could have the two last tracks though from the American release.  2-D (Damon Albarn from Blur) does great job as the band's head singer.  Nice extra vocals from Noodle (Miho Hitori from Cibo Matto).  Best songs: Punk, Tomorrow Comes Today (one of Automator's best work), Clint Eastwood, Rock Da House.  The album overall has something for everybody: indie-rock fans, punkers, backpackers.  Really good for those who have an open taste to music.
B000002MUW|5.0|After the controversial Erotica, Madonna returned two years later with her first (and only) venture into R&amp;B. She does it very well too. Bounce along with the first track Survival, where Madonna laments on her career and how she's survived, or the thumping I'd Rather Be Your Lover. The album also contains two of her biggest hits from the 90's, the lush ballad Take A Bow, and the sing a long Secret. Madonna pays homage to her critics in Human Nature, which is one of her shining moments in her entire career. My favorite track is the Bjork written Bedtime Story, Madonna's very first venture into the realm of techno music, excellent track. The only filler I could find on this album was the song Don't Stop. Love Tried To Welcome Me and Sanctuary are some of Madonna's most underrated songs. This is a pleasant album to listen to, so give it a try!
068818071X|5.0|Marian Keyes is one of those writers that you await anxiously for a new book to be published.  I must say I was not disappointed in the wait for her newest novel.<br /> I discovered her when I read &quot;Watermelon&quot; fell out a little over &quot;Lucy Sullivan's Getting Married&quot; and have now rediscovered through &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot;.<br />In Rachel's Holiday you follow the character through the realization of her addictions. Even if you do not have an addiction or know of anyone that does you will still connect with this character.  She is strong and self defacing all at the same time. At times this book can be rather depressing but Keyes still throws humor in where you think there could be none.  <br />When I was done with this book all I could do was lay down take a deep breath and relish in it's after glow.
0395645662|4.0|hi! The world of &quot;The Giver&quot; seems to be perfect, until Jonas discovers its dark secrets: The community isn't what it looks like: the people have been genetically manipulated. Lois lowry's novel can be seen as a foretelling of what might be. It's easy to understand and you can imagine the world of the community very well. I think it's a great story. =;o) SKV
B00003CXE7|3.0|Without the incredible fight scenes, this movie would be nothing.  The movie simply took too much time to develop a rather unoriginal story (the entire plot is essentially told in the trailer).  The good points; I did find the combat scenes to be nothing less than spectacular, and Russell Crowe does an exceptional acting performance despite a weak supporting cast (the only expection being Joaquin Phoenix, who played the role of Commodus).  As the special features go, the making of and historical information have a few cool facts, but have little replay value, and deleted scenes are nothing more than talking. Overall, I would recommend at least watching it.  It's not the blockbuster in makes itself out to be.
0452282152|5.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring<br />This novel is reminiscent of the equally popular \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\".  The theme of both books is that beautiful women, especially of an earlier age, are not in control of their destiny with regards to men.  Henry James said exactly that in \\"Portrait of a Lady\\".<br />In the case of \\"The Girl with the Pearl Earring\\", the maid Griet, her beauty attracts the interest of powerful men-in this case the painter Vermeer and his patron.  Tracy Chevalier, the author, gives us clues that their interest is dangerous and could lead to tragedy.  When a gentleman fondles a maid in 1665 the maid cannot offer much resistance owing to her low status in life.  More likely than not, as with Fantine in \\"Les Miserables\\", it is the maiden who is cast into trouble.<br />The beauty of this novel, for a male reader like myself, is that is draws you into the perilous existence inhabited by young women. Prior to this I always thought young women like Griet were just glittering beauties sailing easily through life on their good looks.  It's kind of like reading the diary of a teenage girl-highly guarded and something to which one would not normally be privvy.<br />This novel is erotic too, but in a 17th century demure sort of way.  Griet, we learn, is loath to let her full head of hair be seen by any man and she would never been seen with her lips held open.  When she is intruded upon with her long mane of hair freely unfurled the reader's heart flutters and it must have for the young girl.  And when she moistens her lips and holds them open at the request of the portrait painter Vermeer we are absolutely aghast and tingling with erotic excitement.<br />The other theme of this novel is the brutality of being poor and female in earlier ages.  This is much like \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" where the two sisters are pushed into the business of entertaining men by their impoverished family.  Griet is pushed into working as a maid because her family is poor as well.  The women who work as maids of geishas have a brutal pecking order and are quite cruel to one another.  An unattractive woman in the Geisha household is call \\"Pumpkin\\" because that is the shape of her head.  Griet undergoes similar cruelty by Vermeer's children and the other maids in the large house.<br />For me, the most thrilling parts of the novel are where the young maid Griet is allowed to go into Vermeer's studio.  This creates much jealously in the Vermeer household--not even the painter's wife is allowed into the room where the master creates his masterpieces.  This is what is meant by the book jacket blurb that she is \\"drawn into an artistic wakening\\".  Griet learns the subtlety of light, how to grind various potions from the apotheracy into vivid blues and reds, and the way a painting is made.  It is assembled not by drawing an initial outline as one would imagine.  Rather layer upon layer of color blotches are laid down until the final form takes place.men who work as maids of geishas have a brutal pecking order and are quite cruel to one another.

B00003CX5P|2.0|The visual of this movie is so meticulously constructed the it made me twice as sad to see the story and screenwriting skill is only third graded.  Where is the tension in plot?  Do we care about the characters and what is happening?  I remember watching the underwater scene and was quite fascinated by the beauty of the transparent palace or whatever you called it...then I fell asleep.  Watching this movie is like staring at a beautiful piece of oil painting for more than 2 hours straight; one can't been blamed for falling asleep once or more along the way.  This film should be cut into a 3 minute trailer, because lets admit that a trailer is what it is.
B000056K04|4.0|I've read most of the other reviews for this CD and I see a trend in each.  Almost all of them have said that the real DMB, even with these songs, will be heard best live on tour.  I can't agree more.  These songs are ok at best, and hopefully without their new producer breathing down their necks, the band will stretch a tad more live with the jamming.<br />The cryptic lyrics of &quot;Under The Table and Dreaming&quot; are nowhere to be found, the musicality and lyricism of &quot;Crash&quot; and the musical innovation of &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; is limited. Also, I agree that we don't have quite enough of the BAND from the Dave Matthews Band missing mostly Boyd Tinsely's fiddling.  I became a fan of DMB only 2 years ago never having heard their music until I heard &quot;Ants Marching&quot; at a party and didn't know what it was.  Hearing a band that wrote, sang and played their own music on real instruments (almost no electric) was fresh to me and inspiring.  After looking at some of their early works in &quot;Remember Two Things&quot; and seeing their song writing progression, I realized that Steve Lillywhite had almost nothing to do with some of the Band's best songs (I mean in terms of their creation).  Thank God for his ingenious notion to let the band work their magic themselves.<br />Glen Ballard's songs are in line with what is wrong with music today.  We don't need DMB turned into a pop/rock band of mainstream status.  The reason they are not played on the radio that often is because they transcend definition. Though some of the songs on this album are fun to listen to and are not bad even, it is not a step forward for the band, not an evolution.  The songs that were on the trashed album: Grey Street, Diggin a Ditch, Raven, Sweet Up and Down, Grace is Gone... would not have had much radio play, but it would have been a natural progression for the band.  Instead of featuring Dave on the electric guitar, it would have been a 12 string accousticguitar.  Those songs would have made their new album the most spiritual album of theirs with some new and interesting music that gave each band member its abililty to stretch themselves further.  Holding back great musicians for the purposes of becoming perhaps more popular is no different than selling out.  I bought this album and listen to it because it is my favorite band playing new music I have not heard.  But I still play their first studio album, which is now seven years old, much more.  And, truth be known, I hear &quot;What Would You Say&quot; and &quot;Ants Marching&quot; played on the radio stations around here just as often as &quot;The Space Between.&quot;
0792833236|5.0|...I mean ever seen by myself.  It is usually preponderating to suggest what the Best Ever movies are; but if I have to pick one American movie out of the thousands that I have seen and name it the best, Raging Bull is my choice.  Why?  Flawless characterization, not one single bad scene, many memorable good scenes, first rated editing, cinematography, acting, screenwriting, and, of course, direction.  On a more personal level, the story and character bring a deeply felt resonance in my heart.  Time and again I come back to this movie, and it works everytime I watch it.  It never dates, but gets better with time, because the portrayal of Jake is realistic and humanistic.  Some filmmakers are to be admired for their sheer ingenious exercise in film technique; others have a good story to tell but can't really tell them well.  Scorsese is the perfect master in filmmaking.  He has good stories to tell, and he told them better than anyone else.
0844660736|5.0|Rarely does a book come along that so moves, embraces, and captivates you that you emerge from the experience a truly changed person. My Family and Other Animals is such a gem. The author graciously transports the reader into the magical childhood world of Gerry Durrell, a British youth whose eccentric family whimsically decides to plop themselves on the Greek Island of Corfu. With the touch of a master sculptor, Durrell crafts the reader into his childhood world, allowing us to experience Gerrys's family, their unusual assortment of visitors, and his relationship to the natural world around him, hilarious episodes and all, with the same kid-wonder that we all sadly abandon upon reaching adolescence. The result is an uproariously funny account (all true, according to Durell), mixed with both the innocence of youth and the literary gifts and hindsight of a perceptive, nature-loving litterateur.<br />Get this book, read it regularly - and you'll soon notice that both the book and its episodes are things that you simply can't leave behind.

6305428352|1.0|I had high hopes for this film based purely on my admiration of Richard Dreyfuss as an actor. What a disappointment. Dreyfuss is fine (though I don't think he deserved the Oscar nomination). The movie is treacle of the worst kind. I don't mind being manipulated by a film, but when that manipulation is so obvious, I just can't get past it. The harder they try to make me cry, the harder I resist. (Don't think I'm unfeeling; I bawled my eyes out at &quot;Terms Of Endearment&quot;, &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; and many others). The whole subplot of the deaf son was unnecessary and there only to &quot;tug at your heartstrings&quot;. Yuck. To make matters worse, Mr. Holland's &quot;Opus&quot; is awful and any true musician will tell you this. It's really bad. So's the movie.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Is Steven Merritt the best songwriter in years? Probably (I'd throw in Jarvis Cocker, Stuart Murdock and Paul Heaton in that mix).  In fact, he could very well be the second coming of pop music.<br />As a relative newcomer to world the The Magnetic Fields I can't really say anthing that hasn't already been said regarding Steven Merritt and the Magnetic Fields.  I first heard discussion of them of the Saint Etienne mailing list and everyone who had listened to the record extolled its virtues unflailingly.  I picked up a copy of disc (ok, I burned it off Napster, I confess)and after one harf-hearted listen it lay dormant on my shelf for five months.  Then wanting something new to listen to, I decided to give it another listen.  How I missed it the first time is beyond me.  Pop music, and yes, it is basically pop music, never sounded better.<br />Much has been made of Steven's lyrics, and rightfully so.  THey are once simple, charming, compelling, maddening, frusterating, emotional, glorious and utterly original  (&quot;We don't have to be stars at night, or electric eels under the covers&quot; Cooooool!).  WIth so many songs one might think there would plenty of fillers, but alas my good friend, it is not so.  Every song has something to say in a new, exciting way.  None of the &quot;I love you, I lost you, I'm sad&quot; crap we hear on the radio.  And &quot;Long-Forgotten Fairy Tale&quot; has the most effective use of a banjo in a synth-pop song since Erasure's &quot;Don't Suppose.&quot;<br />The styles of music are varied (Belle &amp; Sebastian, early Pulp, Beach Boys, Nick Cave, etc, etc, etc.) but as any good musician should, Steven Merritt explores his craft, tweaking it, flipping it upside down, never settling for doing the same thing over, and we're all the more lucky for it.  And then there's the lyrics.  Wise and full of truth, they are what love is really about.  Love is pain most of the time, and Steven Merritt seems to embrace that pain whole-heartedly (I don't want to get over you, Chicken with it's head cut off, Sweet Lovin' Man, The Cactus where heart used to be, etc).<br />In case you missed it the first time around (like I did), do yourself a favor and did miss it again.  It's epic in scope, often graphic in nature, dead on in it's observations, and even a bit narcissistic and over the top in design, but anything less would have been a major disappointment.<br />One of the best CD's I've EVER heard. 'Nuff said.(I don't want to get over you, Chicken with it's head cut off, Sweet Lovin' Man, The Cactus where heart used to be, etc).  <br />In case you missed it the first time around (like I did), do yourself a favor and did miss it again.

630528069X|5.0|OK. First of all, if you don't own this DVD yet, hold on to your purchase as in July 2001 Fox will again reissue this as a double disc special edition. Fans will buy it again. Bummer. But this original release still is a good DVD. Great sounding Dolby 5.1 and good picture quality as this is a THX DVD. YOu should know the story by now, Bruce Willis is a NY cop who is in the wrong place at the wrong time ( a robbery is taking place). Great action, funny one liner. Alan Rickman is excellent as the bad guy. Somebody should hire him as the next James Bond's villain. One last note to Fox, rather than releasing the same movie twice, why don't you release other titles that yet to surface on DVD like you know the famous trilogy.
B00005ASOC|2.0|As you can tell by the first review, this movie has a plot extremely similar to the Karate Kid.  I found there were many unneeded scenes, which moved the plot at an extremely slow pace.  Jamal develops a friendship with a girl in his class, yet for all we know nothing comes out of this friendship.  Forrester obviously has a sort of psychological condition, but we find very little out about this as well. The film is somewhat distanced from the viewer, which does not work well for this film.  Great performances by Connery and the actor whom played Jamal, but overall, as Jamal might say: been there, seen that.
0060179872|3.0|I liked the book because it dose give a lot of information about her and her life. But the book also talks about all these other people and it critisises her and her life and a author should not do that about the subject he is writing about. So I think this book is good to get for people who are more interested in her death more then the girl herself. If you truely love Marilyn she would not want you to buy this junk. It dose have a lot of cool pictures but thats all I would buy it for.
B00005LB9O|2.0|Travis will be an invisible band if this album is any indication of their future. This albums is a mediocre offering from a band who have had two stellar albums to date.<br />I've seen Travis in concert and am a big fan of the band, but Invisible Band lacks the raw energy of their first album or the sonic depth of the second.<br />Rarely do you hear the electric guitar over the acoustic. The lyrics lack the poinancy of Why Does it Always Rain on Me. <br />This album is vanilla. Every track is like the last and the band never shows the energy that these youths have in them.<br />How would I describe it? \\"[junk] rock?\\"...\\"No, not quite\\"...\\"Wuss rock?\\"...\\"That's it.\\" (apologies to the Simpsons)<br />If I had to guess, I would say that Travis is trying to take advantage of the Boy Band craze. Pipe Dreams has the most potential of any of the tracks...a Leonard Cohenesque song, but where the track could really have some punch like XTC's \\"Dear God\\", it pulls back and ruts in cliches and the same old crap.
B000002LQR|5.0|I am aware that Nirvana's Nevermind was released in the Nineties and that it was a groundbreaking album.  However, I wish to argue that Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the best album of the nineties.  The first thing that most listeners will notice about this CD is that it has 17 tracks.  Then you may notice that every track is phenomenal.  There is not a mediocre song on the entire album, it is all great.  It was Blood Sugar Sex Magik that really defined the Chili Peppers and helped to make them stars.  Most of the songs are very funky, but there are alos some very heart felt serious songs on the album.  Blood Sugar definately defined Nineties alternative music.  This album still gets radio play even today.  In fact, all 5 songs that were released for radio are still played rather regularly almost a decade later.  And the music is just as relevant and good as it was in '91.  Blood Sugar Sex Magik has some of the best Chili Pepper songs on it.  My personal favorites are: &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot;, &quot;I Could Have Lied&quot;, &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, and &quot;Sir Psycho Sexy&quot;.  But once again the whole CD is great, no weak points.  I can't say enough good things about this CD.  It is definately one of my favorites and in my opinion, the best album released in the nineties.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I know that 2001 is still young, or was when this CD was released and wrote this review, but this may prove to be the best album of 2001.  In the same lines as Kid A, this CD proves that Radiohead can continually create unconventional music that can still be beautiful and breathtaking.  The first song on the CD takes a little time to get used to, not as moving as the first bar of track 1 on Kid A.  The next song on the CD, &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, is in my opinion not only the best song Radiohead ever recorded, but one of the best popular music songs I have ever heard.  The rest of the CD is incredible, with the only exception being &quot;Knives Out&quot;.  I just really don't care for that song all that much.  However, the rest of the CD more than makes up for one mediocre track.  Amnesiac, much like Kid A, is incredibly diverse, with each song sounding like an entirely different band has composed it than did the previous.  One thing that I have said before and definately stands out on this album is that Thom Yorke has one of the best voices around right now.  I really wish I could sing like that guy.  Although, many people may complain at the lack of &quot;standard&quot; rock songs on this album, or the fact that it is just &quot;too weird&quot;.  But if you are willing to give this album a chance I think you will be presently surprised.  If you are new to Radiohead though, perhaps you should start with The Bends or OK Computer, which are a bit more mainstream than Kid A and Amnesiac.  In closing, I think this may prove to be the best album of 2001, aside from Tool's Lateralus.
0767817478|5.0|I am sure all you have seen one movie that you enjoyed tremendously, has the movie Godzilla ever come to mind, well if it has not yet, it soon will after you watch it. Godzilla was an exciting movie to millions of viewers in North America, and around the world. With its phenomenal special effects and its emotional and unique beginning to it&#8217;s exciting and thrilling ending, Godzilla will keep you on the edge of your chair.The movie definitely deserved an oscar for special effects. I am sure that there will not be another movie for a long time that will give the same affect to people as Godzilla . - FIVE STARS BABY!!
6305079811|3.0|Taken as what it is, a B movie, it's thoroughly enjoyable. Adding on a first-rate score made it that much better.
0451527046|5.0|The book Treasure Island was a very thought out story, which had very effective characters. The names of the characters brought out the story, such as Long John Silver, he had a wooden leg and he was very tall. The author also made me very impatient, because at the beginning I knew that this was going to be a story about a treasure hunt, but I had to read a lot to get to that point. The setting was very evenly set out, like the author talked about the captain in the day, and Long John the mean person in the night. The author made the book exiting by not making the characters sail to the island, then find the treasure, and come home. He made it interesting, while they were sailing, and when the reached the island. The best part of the story I liked was when Jim a young boy, is of to take a tour of the island by himself when he hears shuffling in the bushes, this happens until Jim looks behind the bushes to find his old friend who has been stranded on the island for many years. Situations like that is what made the book Treasure Island a very exiting, adventurous, and enjoyable book to read.
B0000062GK|5.0|Well, if you know me, you know I love guitar. I've explained why before, so I'll save you from reading it again. Suffice it to say that the guitar is a gift from god and we should all worship it. There, 'nuff said on that.<br />Speaking of gods, have I ever told you how much I love Joe Satriani? No? Well, let me say it here, Satch is a guitar god, and there are none who can touch him. Oh, you think not? You think Eddie Van Halen is better? Listen to The Summer Song. Steve Vai? After I stop laughing, pop in Rubina. Hell, for anyone who needs a lesson on why Satriani is the best guitarist to ever walk our fair planet, all you need to do is listen to this CD. It will completely blow you away, and if it doesn't, you are an empty husk of a human being who should look for where your soul went.<br />I can't think of one track that I do not like, but there are several that I have to stop what I'm doing when they come on because I get lost in them. One is the title track, Crystal Planet. My god, how can he do all that?! Then there's Raspberry Jam Delta-V and Ceremony, two blistering tracks that really get me going. A Train of Angels, with its military drum beat, is a blast to listen to, and it is part of my personal life soundtrack.<br />Funny that I mention that word, soundtrack. I am in the process of writing a book (aren't we all?), and when I get stuck in a certain part, this CD really helps to shake the cobwebs loose and give me energy. If the book ever makes it into movie form, some of these tracks HAVE to be in it. It wouldn't be the same without them.<br />Get this CD. Lock it in your player. Don't loan it out to anyone. Love it. It might just save your soul...
B00003CXE6|3.0|When I watched the academy awards I had this nagging feeiling that Gladiator, a really big bang film would withought a doubt win best picture.  I was right.  While Gladiator looks really cool and exciting on the surface, if you look deeper you will see that this is a average movie that dosent really excell in any general area.  Now I want to point out that this is not a bad movie, it just dosent excell in any area, the story line is okay, the action is okay, the charachters are okay, everything is pretty much okay.  The music is the big part of this movie, although at first glance it just sounds like a women humming and singing although it really helps set the mood.  The action sequences for this movie are okay but are really violent and should not be watched by anyone under 15.  In conclusion this is just another okay movie that is worth a rental and a purchase of the soundtrack and that is about it.<br />The Good: Great soundtrack, action sequences are good, the ending   is pretty good<br />The bad: the characters arnt really developed, nothing really astonishing<br />And the ugly: the action sequences are gory and only for mature audiences.
B000002H2H|5.0|Not just best Metallica album, but id say its the best Metal Album of all times. I thought Black was their best album. That was until i really sat and listened to this Firstly songs like Fade to Black or Call of the Ktulu could never be made by todays bands. I mean imagine LImp Bizkit trying to sing Fade to Black. Fred Durst would mess it up so bad Fight Fire with Fire is a really good opener. Catches the listeners attention. ALso gives them a taste to what the album has in store. My other favorites are Fade to Black, Ktulu, For WHom the Bells Toll and Creeping Death Fade to Black is as chilling as its message. Real Great song. Can compare to later classics like Nothing Else Matters and Unforgiven FWTBT is amazing. Great opening riff. And the rest of it measure up to the start. If u listen to S &amp; M you will realise the greatness of this as it has the greatest crowd reaction Creeping Death is probably their heaviest song and is really, really great Ktulu is just an oddessy in Metal. Greatest Instrumental ive ever heard. Take that Beethoven, Motzart and Bach. You guys cant hold a candle to this baby. Greatest instrumental ever.
B00000J2PH|3.0|I have this record on vinyl and now twice on cd.We all know the music is N0 1 but to say its remastered and the best yet on cd is just not true. The only thing i can say is the original session must have been recorded on second rate equipement, and that is a real shame because the songs on this record are some of the best of all time,pity the engineering wasnt.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is a very interesting CD im use to Blink 182s profanity and imature lyrics and its cool to hear a band that sound like them in a way but dosent rely on four, four letter words to get themselvs through songs. My favorite is &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; it rates with &quot;Time of your life&quot; both totaly different songs but both powerfull. I would want to warn any younger person buying this cd that &quot;Having a Blast&quot; may give them bad ideas and or disturb them but that goes to show you that a well written song can change the way people act, think, and live......
B000000W74|5.0|CHILL OUT was Hooker's fourth album since his triumphant comeback began in 1989 with THE HEALER.  CHILL OUT also won a Grammy in 1995 for the Best Traditional Blues Album.  The title track features long time supporter Carlos Santana and his band. Van Morrison further cements their long-standing friendship with a duet on&quot; Medley: Serves Me Right To Suffer/Syndicator.&quot; Charles Brown and his band join in on &quot;Kiddio&quot; and &quot;Annie Mae.&quot;  Unlike some blues CDs filled with guest performers, the guests on this CD do not dominate the songs.  John Lee certainly is the front man.  In fact, of all the Hooker albums I have heard, and there are hundreds, I would have to say the best display of his vocal talents of all his contemporary recordings.<br />I had the privilege of seeing Hooker two years before his death during his last performance on the East Coast.  The CD's last track is slower blues ballad; &quot;We'll Meet Again.&quot;  If there is blues in heaven, hopefully we will indeed, meet again.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Lucas is learning from the fans, i just cant wait to get my fingers on this DVD. This is a treat fore the whole family. Now let's do episode 4,5 and 6. Next year X-mas is even better on May 22, i will sit in the theater watching episode II. See you all there. Greetings from the donkey from Shrek.
0553106635|5.0|A Storm of Swords is the third book of 6 planned in this series.  If you like intricate plots, political intrigue and &quot;realistic&quot; fantasy where the characters have strengths and weaknesses, then this book is for you.  I am widely read in this genre.  I appreciate the minimalist approach the author has to magic in fantasy - and his willingness to take chances with his characters.  You really do not know how this whole series is going to end - the story is very refreshing in its unpredictability.  This is not &quot;high fantasy&quot; - this is GOOD fantasy.  Enjoy.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|The best way to view this follow up to Chao's wonderful &quot;Clandestino&quot; is as the second half of a double album. This is both fortunate and unfortunate, as Clandestino (a 1998 release) was a remarkably fresh and inspired addition to the world music/latin music scene. &quot;Proxima Estacion: Esperanza&quot; carries on many of the themes and explorations of its predecessor. Again, Chao sings in Spanish, French, Portuguese and English (and this time adds Gallego for good measure). Again, his music is accessible while still like nothing else you are likely to hear this year. Highlights include &quot;La Primavera &gt; Me Gustas Tu&quot; and &quot;Mi Vida&quot;, but there really is not a poor track on the CD.
B00003CX8J|4.0|This movie was actually pretty good for a comic-book movie, or any action movie for that matter.  Some of the people who gave it one star apparently don't know how to listen well to the big talking heads on the movie-theatre screen.....how the mutants &quot;got&quot; their powers is &quot;explained.&quot;  Um, they were like, born with them?  Duh?  That's what a mutant is, a chromosomal abberation.<br />Secondly, people complain about either not enough action or not enough character development.  It was OBVIOUS the focal point of the story was Wolverine and Rogue.  Their story was the fulcrum point for the whole film and a way to get the ball rolling for following movies.  These two characters were developed really well, and I felt satisfied with the exposition of the others considering their most outstanding personality traits were touched upon.<br />Also, this movie had more to offer than just action and comic-book icons.  It really portrayed how cruel the dehumanization of those different from ourselves can be.  This lesson was balanced with the message of non-violent protest and change through understanding and education, rather than annihilation and force.  The viewer can sympathize with both Xavier's and Magneto's (yes, that's their names :P) causes, but one realizes that Magneto has been possibly hopelessly scarred by his persecution at the hands of Nazis, and he refuses to let his hatred and anger go and channels them into a very deadly, inhumane cause.<br />There were some problems, of course.  How come Xavier didn't know there was a mutant in the academy?  Maybe he has to focus on what he's looking for, I don't know, but that threw me off.  Also, some of the lighting was really bad.  It was most noticeable in shots of Famke Jannsen (Jean Grey).  The unflattering shadows actually made her look quite unattractive at times.  Also, in the scene where Magneto has Rogue in the big &quot;mutant-o-matic&quot; at the end, Scott and Jean argue about &quot;taking a shot,&quot; and Jean keeps telling Scott to wait.  For what, praytell?  I still can't figure this out, and I hope someone else here understood what they were quibbling over.  I also found Halle Berry's performance a bit lacklaster on more than one occasion, and her white wig really should have been constructed better.  And of course, Sabretooth and Wolverine flew JUST a wee bit too far when they jumped or were pummeled by 2x4's.<br />All in all, however, this movie accomplished its aims, I think, and was well done, especially in comparison with Batman and Robin, the latest teeny-bopper horrors, and Battlefield Earth, to name a few.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|So Kevin Kline is a little heavy on the French accent, I almost think he did deliberately, it just adds to this comedic, very cute love story.  Meg Ryan is so adorable &amp; natural in this part, her quirkiness &amp; feminine charms just make us girls so jealous.  The music is another wonderful addition, hip and Euro, the soundtrack is a must if you love this movie.  If you I love happy endings this one's for you!  French Kiss is &quot;one of those&quot; that you just can't get tired of watching over &amp; over.  I've worn out the video, now I have to buy it on DVD!!
6305622930|1.0|I'm sorry to say but i did not buy this dvd, I wanted it very badly because I have seen the movie many times and I think that it is just fantastic. But I am tired of giving in to these idiot manufactures who keep making these movies in widescreen format. I'm sure there are some people out there that like having their screen reduced down in size but I don't and it just seems like everyone that I talk to feels the same as me. So sadly to say I won't buy this movie until it comes out in regular format. Maybe with a little luck manufactures will read this and get on the ball and listen to the people.
6305692572|3.0|Want to cry, see this movie.  Want to get depressed, see this movie.  Two great actors, sexy Andy Garcia as the overly nurturing husband &amp; Meg Ryan as the alcoholic wife.  Maybe because I am such a fan of Meg's I don't want to see her this way.  She's capable of good serious acting, she's proven it in this one, but it isn't a great movie.  Andy gets to blow-up a couple of times, and he's very good at it.  But good acting doesn't necessarily make for a good movie.  Dull headache after seeing this one.
B00005JGAB|5.0|This record defines music as we know it nowadays. 14 of the best songs rock n'roll has given us in less than thirty minutes. An absolute &quot;must-have&quot;. Thank you Ramones. Gabba Gabba Hey!
0792844882|5.0|I have read some really bad reviews for this film and agree with a lot of what was said. This movie is not a shining example of good acting or good writing, but come on! It's definitely a sight to see, in more than just the obvious/sleazy ways. Anyone who loves the vitality of color and sparkle should see this film. The dance scenes are also worth looking at. The movie represents an atmosphere that most people never experience. I recommend this DVD if you want to forget about your normal reality for a couple of hours.
B000002B1M|5.0|This album is one in itself. Man, if not as good, it's just a minimal of Illmatic. Every track from \\"The eEssage\\" to \\"If I Ruled The World\\" is bumpin.  \\"The Message \\" is by far the best trak on this whole cd. It's guitar-strummed gangsta-style beat behind truthful lyrics from the poet/pharoah. The lyrics are so true in that song, its unbelievable. \\"Street Dreams\\" s also an awesome song. \\"Then, there's \\"I GAve You Power\\", a  song about a day in the life of a gun. It's all there: How to sleep, eat, breathe, get used, cry for help, its so beautfully planned.  Then, \\"Watch Dem ...\\" iss awesome too. Can't stop listening to that song. \\"Take It In Blood\\" is a soft-gangsta song, not too hardcore, but still got the backbeat to it. \\"Nas Is Coming\\" featuring Dr. Dre...now that is a song to check out. Awesome beat, awesome lyrics, \\"Nas Is Coming, Nas Is Coming...\\" Another tight song is \\"Affirmative Action\\" with the Firm. Gangsta beat, gangsta lyrics, \\"You touch mines, I'll react like a Rotweiler\\". \\"The Set Up\\" was alright, but it didnt seem to shine as much as the other tracks. \\"Black Girl Lost\\" was alright, a softer side to Nas. It's about a girl who doesn't know what she's doing with her life and she's sick and tired of her b/f. \\"Hello? Hey. Whats up? Ain't nothin girl, this ... stressin, talkin bout all this down-south back to Africa ... again. I can't take it no more.\\" \\"Suspect\\" was alright, sweet back beat...off da hook. \\"Shootouts\\" was awesome. \\"Shootouts are on, dont come out tonight; you might get your ... bust down tonight.\\" \\"Live ... Rap\\" coulda possibly been a freestyle, but im not sure...its hard to tell because freestyle or not, Nas still shines like a shooting star. \\"If I Ruled The World\\" was the second best song on the cd. I remember on a really rare remix cd i got of Tupac Shakur, he used the same beat on a song called \\"Life As An Outlaw\\". Pretty phat stuff, yo. Get this cd now cuz it is awesome...it should actually be 5 stars. It is as good as Illmatic. Promise. If you liked his debut, you will love this one! Peace, and keep the streets clean from gang violence, y'all. Keep it real!  -JJ. If you liked his debut, you will love this one! Peace, and keep the streets clean from gang violence, y'all.

0345423496|4.0|This novel begins when Frank Poole, the Discovery astronaut from the novel 2001, and who was killed bt HAL on the first mission to Jupiter, is found by a deep space crew, frozen. He is re-animated by advanced technology, in the year 3001, so all of his previous friends and acquaintances are long dead, dust forever. Poole is able to explore much of the human occupied solar system and later has contact with the mysterious black monolith on Europa, and also with what used to be Dave Bowman and HAL from 2001. This is the novel that concludes the four volume series that began with 2001 back in 1968. <br />Clarke includes a lot of foreseeable future technology in this book, including nano-assembly of a person from information stored in a memory device to braincaps that connects a person directly to the global information network and even allows a person to recieve in minutes knowledge that now takes years of study. 3001 is a very descriptive novel, Clarke has a lot to say about possible life and technology as it may exist in a thousand years, it seems he does an amazing job, but no one can tell for certain until the year 3001 is here, in the past just predicting things only 10-20 years in the future has been very difficult indeed. <br />3001 contains thoroughly modern thinking, typical of Clarke, and I am pleased that he wrote it himself without relying on a co-author. I also enjoyed the several pages of notes Clarke has at the end of the book. The major criticism I have for this novel is that the human relationships are only briefly sketched and could have been in more detail. All told though, a fun and easy read.
B000001Y79|3.0|This cd, all in all....is, well, i guess i couldnt explain it. All i can say is that its ok when you are in the mood, but totally ... when ur not. But can totally rule when you are feeling happy. Grrr...i cant say it! It's alright, but its not one of my favorites. I wouldnt really reccomend it to anyone unless they either (1)have no doubt's previous albums, or (2)are a fan of reggae/ska. What I could reccomend is Sublime's self entitled cd. It has the same groove, but WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY better I love it alot. Plus, it is the most popular CD in my town. If they dont have it, they will be considered a loser so they must steal it from somebody (my friends got his stolen...luckily mine didnt!) I rate alot of cds (you probably have seen my reviews hundreds of times) and I have only rated 1/3 of my collection. So this is coming straight from a music collector with lots of experience...its not that good, but ok when you feel 'tragic kingdomish'. If you can decipher what I am talking about. Easier said, or in other words, when you're feeling funky inside and out and you want to listen to something funky but you cant find nothin on the shelves, go out and pick yourself up a copy of \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" from No Doubt. Oh yeah, and the best tracks are \\"Just A Girl\\", \\"Happy Now?\\", \\"Spiderwebs\\", and \\"Don't Speak\\".<br />Peace and Love for everybody,  -JJ<br />P.S>Give 'Pumpkins' a try...you'll enjoy their taste (musicwise)
6303201954|3.0|ST:The Motion Picture has always been a conundrum.  On one hand it was written by Gene Rodenberry and dealt with many of the issues that made the tv show great, spock's search for pure logic or his place in the universe, kirk's one true passion - being the captain, a plot (obviously) similar to episodes such as NOMAD, and a FANTASTIC musical score.  And yet it misses on so many marks.  It is extremely boring for the middle 45 minutes, has very little of the humor from the series, forces the moments that should be suspenseful but aren't (like the wormhole scene) and if you figure out what v'ger is early you can't help but sit through on hour wondering how come kirk or spock didn't figure it out a whole lot sooner.<br />Sadly Robert Wise, an excellent director, was always working from newly updated scripts, which only proves that while Gene Roddenberry is responsible for creating Star Trek, it was always best in other's hands (Gene Coon, Harve Bennett, Nicholas Meyer). This movie despite all it's flaws could have been great with more planning, less gee whiz put you to sleep special effects, and better editing.  But it will never be and Star Trek and science fiction fans are stuck with the fact of (another) blown opportunity.  It will be interesting to see if Robert Wise can do anything with his quest to re-edit the movie.  Yet despite it all someone at Paramount had the sense to give it one more shot with Harve Bennett at the helm.<br />The best part of the movie is of course the score. And if you can fast forward past the idiotic looks on the crew's face for about 15 minutes as they watch a blue glow - v'ger, and accept it's failures and realize what it was trying to achieve than it's worth watching again.  If however you are stuck on what it could have been then rewatch The Wrath of Kahn.  <br />Three final thoughts.  I must be the only one who actually like the uniforms, well i'm not a fashion designer by day (or night).  Secondly, if you have ever read Roddenberry's adaption of the movie you will probably enjoy it, but once again long for what could have been.  Roddenberry was famous for rewriting history so of course the book comes out better.  Finally, to all the critics of that 7 minute shot of the enterprise, go back in time to when the movie came out and tell me you didn't think it was cool at the time.  Eleven years in the waiting, a little indulgence is allowed (and twenty years later that's why they have fast forward on the vcr.) The extra star in the rating is for the music!
B00004STPT|5.0|As a classical musician I rate this music up there with best of the Romantics.  If you take the blatant lifts from the Planets,Gotterdammerung, the familiarities to Sibelius and even Ravel's Bolero with a smile and listen to what Zimmer cleverly does with them it is a sheer joy to listen to. Lisa Gerrard's haunting vocal writing compliments perfectly. Film music is now essentially the &quot;new&quot; classical music of today and gives us that glorious rich orchestral palette that we all love - it at least keeps classical music alive and I am pleased that this soundtrack has proved so popular. I recently saw the film on video and could hardly concentrate on it as I was only interested in the sound track which was drowned out by the action and dialogue! The music stands on its own, buy this CD, I hope Hans Zimmer writes an orchestral suite of it so that one day I can go into a concert hall and hear it played live.
B00005BJPO|2.0|ohhhh man. I'm getting scared.  I've read two reviews that say the new english dub isn't as good as the original.  My heart is filling with dread as I await it's release.  Why oh why did they have to screw with a classic?  This is like re-uniting with your long lost love and realizing she's got no teeth.  I'll shell out my 30 bucks to own the dvd but damn... she ain't got no teeth! sob sob
0375704027|5.0|Overwhelmingly beautiful.  Breathtaking.  I was taken to a wonderful place, and some part of me will always remain there. Haruki Murakami is a magical author, the kind that doesn't come along every generation.  His stories and characters are so real and so alive that they become part of your consciousness.  You remember them as though you had lived them yourself.  When I'm 110 and in some nursing home, I'm going to think it was ME up on that rooftop with Midori, watching the fire and listening to her play her guitar!  What more do you want from a book?
6305263167|5.0|I've seen lots of great things in life. Such as the &quot;Transformers Movie&quot; and many other surplus arts/movies. But Dire Straits has to be one of the greatest. With beautiful vocals/guitars in the band, what's not to love? I have yet to see this video, but I plan on too. Out of all of their albums.... Making Movies is by far the best. Why did I say that? Well, I have the &quot;Very Best Of Dire Straits&quot; CD, and most of the songs on &quot;Making Movies&quot; is on the Greatest Hits CD. If you're a newbie to this great band, GET IT. If you're a long time fan, you MUST GET IT! Dire Straits is one of the greatests bands, EVER! Just prey it comes on DVD soon! But make sure to buy the CD as well.<br />P.S. I don't know how &quot;Skateaway&quot; and &quot;Expresso Love&quot; aren't on the greatest hits CD!
0452282152|4.0|Rather than discussing the techniques of Vermeer this book portrayed what Dutch life was like during Vermeer's life.  I found it an interesting and refreshing way to introduce the times and circumstances for that particular period, with a good description of how paint colors were mixed as well as some insight into how Vermeer may have actually worked when he was creating.  All in all, a delight to read.
B000000WF9|5.0|That's what the music from the film conveys.  The music is just so touching and beautiful.  It makes you think of your dreams that you're trying to reach.  This is the only soundtrack I have by Michael Nyman, and I didn't buy this cd right after I saw the film.  The music didn't touch me the very first time until I saw the film again, and now I can't stop listening to the cd.  I love the tracks that play them films main theme.  Mostly when they mix it around in tracks 5 and 23.  Track 22 is one that you'll be thinking about for a long time.  That one I always love to listen to because it reminds me of what Vincent said which are words of wisdom.  &quot;I never saved anything for the trip back.&quot;
B000053VAF|4.0|A lot of nay-sayers ... this movie. But I thought it was very comical, witty, and a grand slag at Catholicism.  Hurrah for that let me just say right now. Chris Rock is cool as Rufus, the 13th Apostile.. You knew Jesus? Rock: Knew him? ... owes me 9 bucks!&quot; sooo funny. Jason Lee needs to be in more FUNNY movies like this, and the previous Smith efforts. what were his other movies? I saw Heartbreakers, and he was all wishy washy smiles and puppy dog eyes.  Lee, i guess you are not getting any good scripts my man, 'cause that was terrible! anyways, all I would take out of the movie is that ... Alanis Morrisette as God. Norm McDonald should have been God, cause well, he is. Peace. and I'll SEE YOU ...
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is one of the best fantasy movies of the 1980s.  It has a great plot, and a funny little main character.  It gets a little wacky when they all turn into pigs.  The funniest parts are the Brownies and Madmartigan in a dress.  If you want to know more about Willow, there is a trilogy of books that takes off from the end of this movie, and the first is &quot;Shadow Moon.&quot;  They are just as good as the movie is.
B000002ADT|5.0|If you haven't heard this album - listen to it.<br />It's amazing!<br />Listening to this CD in your house/car/wherever is the aural equivalent of owning an original Impressionist painting.<br />Simple, clean....sit down and LISTEN to it - this CD will command your attention.  And it's also GREAT for background music when I'm cooking, or visiting with people or.......<br />Enjoy!
6305095566|5.0|Sam Raimi had a very dark vision. And he made this movie to make it come to life. Bruce Campbell steals the show in what has become known as his finest hour. For a low budget movie the effects aren't all that bad, and the excellent cinematography will blow you away. There is one scene that will absolutely leave your head spinning, the world's only scene in which a person is [hurt] by a tree. That alone sets the tone for the rest of the movie. I seriously recomend this to all gore fans who have yet to see it.
B00003CXFV|5.0|While &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; follows a similar plot to Jon Travolta's movie from a few years back, &quot;A Civil Action,&quot; this movie is more entertaining and better directed.  It's amazing to think that the director, Steven Soderbergh, released Traffic in the same year as this and not many directors since Steven Spielberg in the early 90's (Jurassic Park &amp; Schindler's List in the same year) have produced two attention-grabbers like these in the same year.<br />Besides the drama involved in the lawsuit against the chemical polluters, one aspect of this movie this is so attractive is it's family feel.  Brockovich, played by Julia Roberts, goes through life as a single mother of three and an interesting boyfriend as she tries to be &quot;Superwoman&quot; and save a small town that is slowly dying off from years of groundwater contamination.  A great performance by Roberts and equally impressive performance by Albert Finney as her boss.<br />The DVD has some interesting extras included.  Like many modern-day DVDs that are based on actual events, there are a few documentaries interviewing the real Erin Brockovich (and her employers) along with stories from the events that actually happened.  (Watch for the sneak cameo of the real Brockovich acting as a waitress to Julia Roberts.) There is a clever short documentary about the filming of the movie included that reveals the director's intentions of making this film as close to the actual historical events as possible. (Which is a miracle in cinema!) Also included in the same documentary are interviews with real-life residents of the polluted town that also filled in as extras at town meetings and other scenes.<br />The DVD includes a director's commentary and a few other small tidbits.  Not entirely impressive with it's extras included, but it's probably because I'm a little biased in that I feel films as good as this should contain many extras that show the magic behind a masterpiece.  One of the best films in recent years - and definitely not a disappointing purchase.
6304899335|5.0|This is one of Hitchcock's earlier movies.  It features a sterling, and humorous turn by Robert Donat as a man mistaken for a spy.  He must run from the authorities and from an enemy spy ring in order to buy himself time to prove his innocence.  Along the way, he runs into Madeline Carroll, who at first unwillngly, and then willingly, becomes involved in his search for the truth.  This is a &quot;light&quot; Hitch film--none of the brooding of later works such as Vertigo, but I find that I prefer that.  There is a nice, happy ending where the bad guys lose and the hero gets the girl.  Futhermore, there is a nice chemistry between the leads, which is especially evident in their smart, crackling dialogue.  This particular edition has a rather superfluous intro, but I bought it as part of a box set with The Lady Vanishes and the first The Man Who Knew Too Much--a good deal.  Also recommended: Vertigo, The Lady Vanishes, Rebecca, and Spellbound--Hitchcock forever!!!!
0763611883|5.0|Many young children don't like tomatoes.  Some retain that distaste into adulthood.  This story shows that stated fussiness about food can simply be a way of getting attention.  Parents:  Pay attention to this story!  The colorful collages of photographs and childlike drawings bring excitement and freshness to the story.<br />Lola is a &quot;small and very fussy&quot; eater.  Charlie is assigned by their parents to feed Lola.<br />Lola begins to expound her theories:<br />&quot;carrots are for rabbits&quot;<br />&quot;peas are too small and too green&quot;<br />Lola goes on to list peas, carrots, potatoes, mushrooms, spaghetti, eggs, sausages, cauliflower, cabbage, baked beans, bananas, and oranges as banned items.  She also notes her reservations about apples, rice, cheese, and fish sticks.  &quot;And I absolutely will never not ever eat a tomato.&quot;  Sounds like peanut butter and jelly are coming up to me.<br />Then Charlie attacks directly by putting out some carrots.  Lola looks at them and says, &quot;Then why are those carrots there, Charlie?&quot;<br />&quot;Those are orange twiglets from Jupiter,&quot; says Charlie.<br />&quot;Mmm, not bad,&quot; Lola replied, &quot;and took another bite.&quot;<br />Charlie puts out peas and describes them as &quot;green drops from Greenland&quot; and Lola finds them &quot;quite tasty.&quot;<br />Mashed potatoes become &quot;cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji,&quot; and Lola decides &quot;I love to eat clouds.&quot;<br />Fish sticks become &quot;ocean nibbles from the supermarket under the sea -- mermaids eat them all the time.&quot;  Lola wants to know if she can have more.<br />Suddenly Lola turns the tables, &quot;Charlie, will you pass me one of those?&quot;  Lola continued, &quot;Yes, of course, moonsquirters are my favorite.&quot;  &quot;You didn't think they were tomatoes, did you, Charlie?&quot;<br />Obviously, Lola knows that they are playing a game, and she likes it.  The new game seems like more fun than laying down the law about what she will and won't eat.  The game puts her in charge by letting her name the foods, as well as her usual game of saying what she will not eat.  Charlie makes room for Lola to assert herself, and all is well.<br />With children, there is a tendency to treat them like subjects of a King or a Queen.  Actually, they feel quite grown up at a young age and want to have some autonomy.  Choice of foods can simply be a testing of limits.  But all children would rather have fun, and can easily be distracted by making the potential confrontation into a game, instead.  This book eloquently makes that point, and ensures many more peaceful hours in many households.<br />After you finish reading the story, you should think about where else you can kid your child out of her or his bad mood.  Come to think of it, when will that approach work with adults as well?<br />Look for the potential to improve every communication!more fun than laying down the law about what she will and won't eat.

B00005BL2A|4.0|If you are one of those DM fans who can't stand the idea of them making an album without any of the music that made them famous, then this disc is not for you.  For others, this collection of subdued synth pop is a welcome addition to their impressive catalogue.  It would seem the boys from Basildon have grown up and perhaps beyond the dance rythms that defined them in the 80s and 90s.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Among the tracks that stand out are &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;I Feel Loved&quot;, &quot;Freelove&quot;, and &quot;When the Body Speaks&quot;.  After years of drug and alcohol abuse that nearly killed him and the band, Dave Gahan sounds incredible.  His voice truly soars and does things it has never done before.  Martin Gore's song writing is as strong as it has ever been.  It may take some getting used to, but this is a great CD and well worth your time and money.
6305897786|5.0|In its opening scene the film references \\"Don Quixote,\\" setting the stage for a story of an anti-hero's quest, a tale laced with light mockery of contemporary society. The world has embraced an 'information age' with its relativistic morality, but is all information good... and what is 'good,' anyway?<br />If anyone reading this wants to discuss the film's enigmatic plot (or compare notes on the *real* 'variations' between the engravings seen in the film), please e-mail me.<br />All I can say is that this movie is not for the average viewer who expects something to blow up every second, let their brain go to sleep and walk away after the film with a warm fuzzy feeling inside. This movie is for anyone who has ever felt the passion of collecting or experienced how thrilling research can be, and wants a change from the usual Hollywood heroics. <br />The audio and video quality on the DVD is good, and the disc has a lot of bonuses, my favorites being Polanski's full-length, in-depth commentary on the film and the 'gallery' which allows you to scroll through the 'LCF' and 'AT' engravings... which are reproduced in fairly low-resolution, unfortunately.<br />In the end I suspect 'The Ninth Gate' will recieve much the same treatment as 'Vertigo'- be misunderstood by its contemporaries and be rediscovered several decades later when its outstanding production features, superbly constructed plot and acting are finally recognized. I hope history remembers this film as being one of the best of the late 20th century, as well as one of the most revealing of our culture's psychology.<br />I think the sheer number of people who feel compelled to comment on it testifies to its ability to effect people... even if they do hate it.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I love movies, normally, however, I watch the movies I love over and over again. I haven't really seen a new good movie in a while. Aronofski's independent venture into the surreal world of &quot;pi&quot; left me dumbfounded... this film &quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; left me... Blown the hell away! I was absolutely amazed! I first saw it two weeks ago... I am haunted by the film. I rented the VHS tape from the store, which was an EDITED version and it was so damn good, I went out and bought the DVD Director's cut the next day. I absolutely love this film, Darren Aronofski, Hubert Selby, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer, Marlon, Jared everyone deserves a damn Oscar, I love this movie. I will never forget how amazing and the impact this movie had on my life. TWO THUMBS UP. I may have lost sleep, got depressed, was left in a dark hole... who cares? I love this movie and I ALWAYS will. Thank you so much for making such a brilliant, life changing movie. YOU ARE INTERNATIONAL TREASURES!! I LOVE YOU!! HERES TO REQUIEM FOR A DREAM!
B00005JIZA|5.0|Have you ever been out on a date and said something stupid that you wished you could take back? Ever thought that maybe you've already met 'The One' and just passed them on the sidewalk? Ever been driving down the highway and wanted to just keep on going, away from everything? Well, so has John Mayer.<br />Mayer writes songs about feelings and experiences that are universal, but expresses them in a voice that is uniquely his own. I doubt there is anyone out there who can't relate to at least one song on &quot;Room for Squares&quot;.  His lyrical brillance makes John's CD something to be poured over, like a great novel that you can't put down. What makes these 12 songs so amazing is that they aren't like every song you hear on the radio, about falling in or out of love, but about real life, and what everyone goes through. As John himself has said, &quot;I'm just like all of you, I just have a nicer guitar...&quot;. Musically, John (a former student at Berklee College of Music)is among the most talented guitarists in music today, and on this CD he is backed by musicians of the same caliber. Talent like Mayer's is rare, and the best way to really appreciate it is to witness it live...but if you can't get to a show, &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is the next best thing. <br />This will absolutely be the best $13 that you've spent in a long time...this CD will become the soundtrack to your life as soon as you put it in your CD player. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars, and after you hear it, you'll know why!
B00005K9LM|4.0|After the huge success of 1982's 'Screaming for Vengeance', instead of attempting another the hit single like &quot;You've Got Another Thing Comin'&quot;, they decided to strengthen their identity as a heavy metal band with the release of &quot;Freewheel Burnin'&quot; (a pseudo-speed metal classic) as the first video and &quot;Some Heads Are Gonna Roll&quot; (a dark political cautionary tune) as the first single.  The rest of the record is packed with metal-god imagry along the lines of 'British Steel' - most notably, &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; and &quot;The Sentinel&quot;.  But the high point of the record is the atmospheric vampire ode, &quot;Love Bites&quot;, which drips with throbbing energy and sacrifices the standard gratuitous exercise in virtuoso guitar leads for intense subtlety.<br />At this point in the history of heavy metal, bands started falling into this style that is endemic in the rap genre - i.e., big anthems written for crowd-pleasing effect about what a great band we are, how much we are going to rock you, and how we know you are all outcasts for being into this type of music.  &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith&quot; is a prime example of this, as is &quot;Rock Hard, Ride Free&quot; (although the guitar parts to the latter stand up well on their own).  (Even worse examples appear on JP's later releases, 'Turbo' and 'Ram It Down'.)  For this reason, I have to fault the executive producer for including a ridiculously redundant live version of &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith&quot; in this reissue.  Moreover, the bonus studio track (from the 'Turbo' sessions apparently), sounds really out of place here as well, although the quality is a bit better than some of the songs on the other reissued releases.<br />Also, I have to comment on the sound.  When it was originally released in 1984, I was a bit unimpressed by the sound of 'Defenders of the Faith' when compared to its predecessor, 'Screaming for Vengeance.'  This reissue does little to improve upon the sound, as the hiss at the beginning of some tracks is a bit too audible.
B0000070QS|5.0|Naysayers - get out of the way!<br />This guy has one of the best voices in music today. Additionally, his lyrics reflect depth of living and a level of introspection and thoughtfulness that completely bely the &quot;eighties&quot; expectations that some fans would hold. A musician who can deftly navigate between the smoothness of technology and the raw sounds of acoustics and voice is someone worth listening to.<br />The disc takes me back to my days in L.A. More music should paint mental pictures as vividly as this work.<br />A true accomplishment!<br />B.W./ author/ Labyrinth of Chaos
B00005B3Z5|4.0|I liked this a lot.  I liked the American version better.  <br />I'm the type who always enjoys seeing the story from different angles, seeing what different directors can do with the same script.  I'm a huge fan of the American version, and wanted to see the original.<br />However, the pacing made the original seem like an outline for the American version.  Understandable, the story arc of the original covered in four hours what the American version covered in about sixteen, leaving six hours for additional subplots.<br />For Americans, the Manchester accent does take some practice, and I'm sure I missed some subtile nuances that I'll catch on the next viewing (and there WILL be a next viewing)....<br />If you can choose between this one and the American version, by all means get the American.  Until the American becomes available, get this one and enjoy!

B00005B7CK|4.0|I guess this movie is supposed to be some kind of modern day Homer's Oddessey.  I never read it, but I've heard that it's a bit similar, but not completely like it.  It stars George Clooney who really surprised me in this movie! I am not much of a fan, and I thought he was very good as the prisoner who breaks loose from a chain gang.  He's kind of the one is charge, and the two men he drags along don't want him to be the one who's boss. One is played by John Turtorro, and well, honestly I have no idea who the other actor is, but he is very good and extremely funny in this movie  They are all on the lam together, and as Clooney is trying to get back to his wife and family the thre of them have adventures -- not all good ones.  They even start a singing career as the Soggy Bottom Boys.  All the songs are old folk and blue grass songs, and the actors lip synch.  I really thought it was Clooney singing the first time I saw this!  The singing and dancing really brings great delight to this very sunny little movie. It kind of reminded me of The Wizard of Oz in that way.  There is even one scene where they view KKK members marching around while hiding behind a bush.  They eventually manage to get three of the members and steal their uniforms to save a man from being killed...In the wizard of Oz, the three friends of Dorothy watch the henchmen for the witch march around and eventually steal uniforms from three of the men.  There is even similar chanting in O Brother... I don't want to give anything else away, but JOhn Goodman plays one of the many people they meet along their journey, and Stephen Root, who is a very funny character actor(the boss on Newsradio) plays a blind dj, who made me howl with laughter. Holly Hunter is in it as Clooney's estranged wife Penelope. The best thing I really loved about this movie is the music.  I bought the soundtrack the next day, and it is awesome.  If you are fan of folk and bluegrass, you'll absolutely love this soundtrack.  It's a very funny film that is well acted and beautifully filmed.  The Coen &quot;brothers&quot; have made another excellent film.  I also love the way the film is made to look like it is an old movie, with the coloring that is used.  It really adds to it. I highly recommend this one..IT's defintely worth buying.ry funny film that is well acted and beautifully filmed.  The Coen &quot;brothers&quot; have made another excellent film.

0441003257|5.0|I first read this book in high school and I've read it every summer since then, I never grow tired of it.  I haven't read any other books by Gaiman or Pratchett, but if you like a bit of dry, sometimes dark, humor, sarcasm and subtle jokes that you sometimes have to reread to get them, then try this book.  The additional footnotes are great and add so much to the wit and humor and the characters (my favorites are definitely Crowley and Aziraphale) are as well developed as the storyline.  Each time I read this book, I find something new to laugh at and it's also sort of like visiting old friends.  I've let a few friends borrow the book and they've loved it as well.  I keep an extra copy around just in case anyone wants to permantely borrow it. Defnintely give it a try!
B00005K9LK|5.0|As my title indicates, this is Judas Priest's best record.  The quality and diversity of the songs is exceptional and the sound is the best they have ever achieved (except maybe for 1986's 'Turbo').<br />&quot;Hellion/Electric Eye&quot; - the riff, the solo, the lyrics - IS not only Judas Priest at its best, but is quintessential heavy metal (. . . even if it does bear some similarity to the riffs on Ozzy Osbourne's &quot;Crazy Train&quot; released over a year earlier) - as is &quot;Running on the Wind&quot;, &quot;Devil's Child&quot;, and the title cut.  Often overlooked, however, are the &quot;love&quot; songs, &quot;Take These Chains&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot;, which are better than anything else they tried to do in that genre (except, maybe, for &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; on 'Hell Bent for Leather').  Finally, one has to mention Judas Priest's one and only super hit, &quot;You've Got Another Thing Comin'&quot;, where they managed to finally reach a much broader audience without toning down the metallic tendencies of the song.<br />You simply cannot call yourself a fan of heavy metal music without owning this record.<br />As for the bonus cuts, &quot;Prisoner of Your Eyes&quot; is an outtake from the 1986 'Turbo' sessions, and if you followed the band at that time, Rob Halford indicated that there were many unused tunes from those session, but at one point, this particular song was going to be given to Julio Iglasias to record.  (Enough said.)  The live version of &quot;Devil's Child&quot;, which is different enough from the studio version for warrant inclusion on this reissue, is taken from the tour supporting the record and may be the version that appeared on a video documenting the tour's stop in Memphis, Tennessee.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|Disney's &quot;Mulan&quot; is the second installment of the &quot;Walt Disney Gold Collection&quot; as of Febuary 1st, 2000. The &quot;Walt Disney Gold Collection&quot; is a group of films that inspire wonder and imagination for a life time, and &quot;Mulan&quot; fits that description perfectly!<br />Mulan was a young woman a long time ago in China. When she fails to please the matchmaker and bring honer to her family, the Huns invade China and her woonded father is summoned to fight, she impersonates a soldier and sneaks into the army to save her father. The penalty for such a crime is death. With the help of Mushu, a tiny dragon, and criki, she becomes a great warrior. When the troop finds she is a woman, they send her back home instead of killing her. When she finds that the Huns they thought were dead are still alive and on their way to kill the emperor, will anyone believe her?<br />The great thing about the &quot;Walt Disney Gold Collection&quot; is that they include special features weather they are on video or DVD. &quot;Mulan&quot; has two incredible music videos as featured on the &quot;Mulan&quot; soundtrack: &quot;Reflections&quot; by ChristinA Aguilera and  &quot;True To Your Heart&quot; by 98 degrees and Stevie Wonder. It also includes a choice of viewing presentations: full screen(1.33:1) and widescreen (1.85:1), theatrical trailer, French and Spanish tracks, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, and is THX Certified. So if you bought the video or DVD when they first came out, you may consider buying it again.
B00000J7JO|5.0|If you're already a Chili Pepper fan, just the first song, Around the World, will fill you with anxiety. You'll wanna rush through the entire CD just to get a sample of every song, each with a different beat, a different meaning. Californication will seem &quot;soft&quot; if you were really into Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but it's still a wonderful album, and a nice break from the rough exterior they've usually got. Porcelin and Road Trippin, for example, are pretty freakin slow for the Chili Peppers, so different, in fact, that if you weren't to hear it on Californication first, you might not even think it was them. But it is, and it's nice to see some variety, while in other cases, it may turn some long time fans off. In the end, the album seems to fill my mind with the picture of a colorful room. It's a colorful album, with colorful songs, which will paint your mind with... colorful... colors. Anyway, ENJOY!
0553213105|5.0|This is my all-time favorite book, and believe me, I've read MANY novels. Jane Austen has excellently captured human nature here, and all of her characters reflect the environment they grew up in which was determined by the social classes of the time period.<br />The main conflict of the book is based on the interactions between these social classes, which is reflected by the title. The prejudice and pride of BOTH the upper and middle class is what the story revolves around, but it isn't the action and intrigue that mark this book, it is the characters that make this &quot;Timeless Masterpiece.&quot;<br />Elizabeth Bennet, whose liveliness and quick wit have often attracted readers, is the main character from the middle class. Mr. Darcy is her counterpart from the upper class. These two drive the book, adding humor and depth with every word.<br />Everyone over the age of 12, including BOTH males and females, should read this book. This isn't a silly romance novel for young girls, it is a classic masterpiece.

Get the CD, because THOSE are the songs that will blow your mind away!
B00005K9LN|4.0|Reissued in the original non-U.S. running order, this record cemented Judas Priest as the preeminent heavy metal band.  I say &quot;heavy metal&quot; because of the music and the themes.  On its previous studio records, the band had intermixed Sabbath-type lyrical themes and plodding melodies with songs that could best be described as hard rock (a la AC/DC).  They would return to the hard rock format on later (and lesser known) records like 1981's 'Point of Entry' and 1986's 'Turbo'.  But 'British Steel' is the first of a line of records that would define heavy metal.<br />The record had its share of thematic anthems, such as &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; and &quot;United&quot; - paving the way for pop metal of the 1980s (e.g., &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; by Twisted Sister).  But the record also had faster and more intense songs, with lyrics of darker mythology, such as &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; and &quot;Steeler&quot;, which were the precursor for a metal style of bands like Metallica that has aged more gracefully. <br />As for the bonus tracks, &quot;Red, White &amp; Blue&quot; is an anthemic outtake from the 'Turbo' sessions which should have probably remained an outtake.  &quot;Grinder&quot; is a good live version of one of the classics on 'British Steel' which was taken (despite what the liner notes say) from a show that was performed and broadcast live on the radio at the height of Judas Priest's career (the 1984 'Defenders of the Faith' tour).
B00003W8NO|5.0|Disney and Pixar's &quot;Toy Story&quot; was the first full-length computer animated feature ever, and now it is the first &quot;Walt Disney Gold Collection&quot; video released as of January 11th, 2000. The &quot;Walt Disney Gold Collection&quot; is a group of films that inspire wonder and imagination for a life time, and &quot;Toy Story&quot; fits that description perfectly! <br />Have you ever had a favorite toy? Well Andy did. His was Woody, a cowboy doll. But when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear space man for his birthday, Woody feels cast aside. Woody's jealousey leads him and Buzz lost far away from home. Now they must work together to get home before Andy moves to a new house.<br />The great thing about the &quot;Walt Disney Gold Collection&quot; is that they include special features weather they are on video or DVD. &quot;Toy Story&quot; has the 1988 Academy Award®-Winning Animated Short &quot;Tin Toy&quot;, &quot;You've Got A Friend In Me&quot; music video as featured on the hit &quot;Toy Story&quot; soundtrack, and a behind the scenes look at the making of &quot;Toy Story.&quot; So if you bought the video when it first came out, you may consider buying it again.
B000002BUY|5.0|This is like, one of the best albums ever. They've got so many different, wild beats, catchy choruses, entreguing lyrics and meanings... everything. If you like Incubus even the slightest bit, you'll love this album. It's their best one yet, and definetly surpasses Make Yourself. While Make Yourself is also a wonderful album, it's nowhere near as playful as S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and even sounds somewhat worn out after listening to them both. We can only hope their next album is at least as good as S.C.I.E.N.C.E.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Yes! The sound track is great.  True, it is not an exact duplicate of the music in the movie, but it captures the excitement and pace of the film.  While all of the singers are excellent, best is Ewan McGregor.  His singing, especially in the movie's original song Come What May, gives chills.  The movie from begining to end (Ewan's voice-over is spectacular, spectacular) is non stop pure enjoyment.  I ran out and got the CD after seeing the movie and was not dissappointed.  From now on, Ewan McGregor should burst into song at least once per movie.  Let's see --humm, Black Hawk Down -- what could he sing?
0440219078|4.0|I think I like the book. It's an extraordinary story about a boy called Jonas who lives in an imaginary future world. One day he experiences what life really means and what makes it worth living, so Jonas makes an important decision with far-reaching consequences for the community and himself. When I read the first few pages I didn't even expect what direction the story may take. I thought it was a lovestory as Jonas seems to have an eye on his friend Fiona. Maybe it was a story about friendship or just a simple fantasy-story. I was really surprised and of course very excited when, step by step, the story was revealed to me.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I'm really not a huge fan of the big budget hollywood movie, but I have to say that Castaway was very well done.  The most likely reason is the masterful direction of Robert Zemeckis who continues to create quality motion pictures time after time.  Tom Hanks gives one of his stronger performances as Chuck Noland, a Fed-Ex higher-up who gets stranded on a desolate island after his plane crashes.  There is little dialogue during Hanks' time on the island, but it is not needed as Zemeckis tells his story through the camera.  It becomes quite interesting to see the de-evolution of this man as he gets back to primal survival skills.  Castaway is chock full of memorable moments and will stick to your ribs, it is a movie you will not soon forget.

B00003CXQX|4.0|Like some of the viewers, I too initially passed on The    Emperor's New Groove last winter.  This was mainly due to some of the reviews (... ... ... David Elliott gave it two (out of four) stars, Michael Medved two and one half (out of four)), and lack of enthusiasm for most motion pictures overall.  2000 was a pretty lackluster year.     Well, thank goodness for the invention of the videocassette!  Since purchasing this hidden treasure last month, I have never had such a blast watching an animated film.  The last time I laughed this much at any cartoon was Disney's Aladdin, with Robin Williams' Genie literally splitting my sides.  I must say the filmakers have outdone themselves here, especially with the cast.  While Groove does not have the visual lushness of Beauty and the Beast or Tarzan, the antics of David Spade (Emperor Kuzco), Eartha Kitt (Yzma), Patrick Warburton (Kronk), and John Goodman (Pacha) make this adventure zip right along.  This film was clearly not made for the tinyest of tots, considering some of the dialogue (Yzma's line about cruel irony), but could nevertheless be enjoyed by all.  I must say I was truly surprised by a Disney film in which the characters did not take themselves too seriously, or get bogged down in mushiness with surgary love songs.  Political Correctness was definately NOT in vogue this time around-an intact family with the father around-imagine that!  Although there is a moral lesson here (finding the good in people), Mark Dindal and his team manage not to hit the audience over the head with it.     Overall, while I do agree that The Emperor's New Groove is not one Disney's classics-The Little Mermaid, The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast belong in that category-it is a great movie and loads of fun to watch, once again with the kudos going out the actors. It is clearly evident that everyone involved with this project had a great time, and were not ashamed of it.  Watch it for yourselves and enjoy!
0380973650|5.0|Earlier this week, I got hit with an unpleasant medical diagnosis. Serious surgery involving sharp knives in proximity to my spinal cord looms in my near-future. None of the writers who normally distract me from my troubles were of any use: not Stephen King, not Jack Finney; Garrison Keillor and Bill Bryson couldn't get a smile out of me.<br />And then, American Gods showed up. I'd quite forgotten I pre-ordered it. For the past two months, I have been in too much pain to sit for any length of time, but when the book came I sat right down and started reading. And was feeling no pain. Just my old pals, Awe and Wonder.<br />That's the best thing I know to say about a book. It helped me through my pain. Thanks, Neil.
0553573403|5.0|This is my favorite epic fantasy work (so far), and one of a handful I am reading more than once (Tolkien and Gene Wolfe have written others).  I can't cover all the reasons why I like it, but if you skim through the other reviews, you're sure to find them.  What puts this saga in a class of its own is that while it remains clearly an epic fantasy in the best of traditions, borrowing elements from history without coming close to representing history (I think that the Arthurian legends are a close literary parallel, though it also calls to mind War and Peace which is more historical), it is, more than any other modern fantasy I can think of, a story about people.  The Others notwithstanding (and I pray Martin manages to bring them in gracefully when they really start to make an impact), the plot is driven by the interaction of human values, not alien menace.  It's a parable of reality that dispenses with a lot of the more simplistic archetypes.  True, Martin walks a fine line between pulpy and literary, but by God he does it well!<br />A particular instance of the principle stated above is that, as more than one reviewer has made me aware of, Martin consistently, relentlessly defines the difference between good and evil for us.  With the one big exception, there is a real dearth of inhuman monsters in these books, but a plethora of human ones.  Good and evil are not a chess game where everyone lines up on one side or the other, but they are made up of the experiences, values and choices of each individual.  Cruelty, vanity and greed are more useful terms than evil.<br />Things can get a bit raw in Westeros and beyond but, of course, not as raw as the nightly news.  This story is hardly overloaded with sex and violence (try William S. Burroughs).  Again, there is a fine line to be walked between appropriate and gratuitous, but Mr. Martin is apparently writing with a charmed pen.<br />Who knows if you'll like it?  It is fantasy, and it is for fun.  Personally I'm just grateful for having had the chance to read something which has brought me so much enjoyment.  I'm just starting in on a slow reread which should take me up close to the next publication.  After the phenomenal &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, part of me is actually quite nervous that Martin can't possibly sustain this level of quality while continuing to develop such a multifaceted plot with so many supernatural threads waiting in the wings.  We all know how easy it is for writers to stumble in the second half (gratuitous football metaphor for my amusement).  I must believe!<br />A final note:  heroes with the capacity to die may be upsetting, but isn't it amazing how much it makes all the characters come to life?  There's food for thought:  would you be alive if you could never die?<br />Ivot grateful for having had the chance to read something which has brought me so much enjoyment.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I seems like everyone is so full of opinions on this record.  I keep seeing Amnesiac referred to as a collection of b-sides and nothing more.  Then there are some who claim it's the finest from radiohead yet.  Well, as close as I can figure it, if this were a collection of b-sides it would have just been thrown together in a hodge podge of poorly engineered garbage.  Instead, the album was handled with an unbelievebale amount of love.  Radiohead never makes this new child feel like it is just the leftovers of Kid A, destined to live in its shadow.  At the same time, it is no greater or worse than any other Radiohead album.  This band is what it is.  They haven't changed anywhere near as much as everyone seems to think they have.  I personally have not heard a radiohead album that WASN'T a masterpiece.  Amnesiac is no exception.  If you like radiohead, you won't be disappointed.

B00003CXDZ|2.0|I rarely walk out of movies- but this was one of them.  Yes, the visuals are amazing, creative, overwhelming.  I liked the images of Montmartre 1899, very evocative.  But I couldn't stand the insertion of modern &quot;pop&quot; music like Elton John thrown into the middle of belle epoque Paris- silly lightweight pop verse treated like it is full of deep insight and meaning.  I felt the director thought 21st century audiences would have been bored with more traditional songs of the time- after all we have to keep the audiences stimulated, stimulated with constant edits, movement, visual changes, and yet soothed by familiar pop songs.  The storyline was so predictable, I felt what is the point of remaining in the theater.  I had seen and enjoyed enough of the visuals but that was not enough to keep me.  I lasted 45 minutes, if my husband had been with me, he would have lasted until the first song and would have been out of there!  Switched theaters for &quot;Swordfish&quot; which had the usual death defying car chases, mayhem, and expensive destruction but with a totally mystifying plot.  Have today's directors forgotten the value of a good plot and character development in favor of over the top art and action direction?
B00001OH7U|5.0|I must of listened to this album at least 400 times over the years since it's release in 1976. Only six tracks, though all memorable. To me this is Bowie's finest album, by what I understand, it was created in the middle of a cocain dust storm and in some ways the ferocity of &quot;Stay&quot; with it's tortured driving rhythm, sounds like a week without sleep : &quot;this week dragged past me so slowly, the days fell on there knees&quot;. &quot;Word on a wing&quot; is almost a cry in the dark, as if Bowie is trying to come to grips with an all merciful God, in the middle of all this madness. He has been quoted in an interview that the title of the record was named after the Christian ritual of the stations of the cross. The pompous march like beggining of the title track and the softer ballads are almost in contradiction with each other. This is probably the ONLY Bowie album whch sounds slighly dated, due to the 70's style lead breaks and solos, yet it was the launching platform for the biggest change and influence on modern music to come.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I bought the soundtrack after seeing the movie for the second time (and definetely not my last). 'Moulin Rouge' might as well be the best movie I've ever seen. It's like this emotional roller coaster that takes you from laughing to crying in a heartbeat. Listening to the soundtrack is kind of like reliving the story. My favorites are the beautiful Elephant Love Medley and the powerful Tango De Roxanne. Also Your Song and Come What May are the greatest love songs in the world. I was surprised by how well the actors (Ewan, Nicole, and the others) could sing. They make it feel so real. *sigh*<br />In other words, if you've enjoyed the movie, you'll enjoy the soundtrack as well.
B00003CXQY|5.0|Great fun for adults and children alike. This cartoon was a hoot. One the adults will want to watch over again with the family (unlike some other children's fare!) David Spade is just great as the Emperor. As a matter of fact, all the acting (voices) are above average. (If you have a DVD disc drive, the game it comes with is pretty entertaining too!)

B00003CXDZ|5.0|As most people know, Moulin Rouge is one of the most famous nightclubs in Paris. However, under the magical touch of Buz Luhrmann, Moulin Rouge became the place of life, death and romance of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.<br />The story was a very simple one - a famous dancer fell in love with a newly arrived poet who, under accidental circumstances became a writer for the new production at Moulin Rouge. Of course, life would not be that easy when the romance was intertwined with a wealthy and powerful Duke, who would never set his eyes on anybody else except the spectacular Satine (Nicole Kidman).<br />Despite the simplicity of the story, Buz was able to turn it into series of jaw dropping musical scenes and spectacular cinematography. The whole picture was truly Luhrmann - abundant adoption of speedy zooming in and out, dark but sharply contrasting colours, repeated landscape under different tones, and super creative screening and editing methods. In Moulin Rouge, you would see a never been so attractive and gorgeous Nicole Kidman, an always handsome and love seeking Ewan McGregor, and a whole lot of superb supporting casts. Buz had made the right choice to cast Nicole Kidman as Satine, the everlasting song bird of Moulin Rouge. She got all the charisma of this character and the essence just flowed out naturally. Ewan McGregor had proved that he is an actor capable of all genres. You won't be able to see a string of Obi-wen Kenobi or the shadow of Trainspotting in him. He is the poet and always the love-obsessed poet Christian in the movie. The supporting cast was also very outstanding. The stage manager, the maid, the playwriting gang and of course the Duke were all very important sidelines of the story. Their relationships with the leading actors spelled out the complexity of human relationships and love, which could be constructive or detrimental.<br />The cinematography of the movie is superb, despite you can see a strong Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet feel. The application of colours was more intense when compared to Romeo and Juliet, probably because this is about a nightclub, which should always be full of life, and colour is a way to bring a building to life. If you are interested in interior designing, Moulin Rouge's interior design is eye dropping. This is because, they really helped to tell the story too.<br />The soundtrack is also ear catching. Since it is about Moulin Rouge, music could not be missed, but the fun part is that you could hear all the best popular music in the past 10 to 20 years, but they were rearranged in a modern form that fit the early 20th century. Not easy but they did it. The music was so rich that, you would really have the urge to follow their singing in the theatre. Of course, provided you do have a good understanding of the western pop culture.<br />In all Moulin Rouge should be one of the movies that you should not miss. It could be one of the best movies in this summer. It is a big hit in Australia, and I do think that it could stir up echoes the western world..

0380796090|3.0|&quot;Watermelon&quot; tells a familiar story--woman is dumped by lousy husband (the day their baby is born, even!), and slowly makes her way back to love.  That said, it doesn't mean that the book is not enjoyable, for it is.<br />OUr protagonist is dumped by her husband at the hospital and flees London to go home to Dublin.  Part of the great fun of this novel is her wacky family--mother with no cooking skills, hippie sister, bitchy sister, oblivious but well-meaning father.  <br />There never is any doubt that she will meet someone better and more suitable (and she does, the student Adam), that her husband will want her back, and that she will ultimately make the right decision (which she does).  But Keyes tells the story with skill and great good humor, and the book is a pleasurable page-turner from beginning to end.<br />Don't look for great literary innovation here.  But if you are a fan of romantic comedies, particularly British ones, this is likely to be right up your alley.  NOTE:  Like one of Keyes' other novels, &quot;Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married,&quot; the foregone conclusion doesn't spoil the book.
6301885732|4.0|nowadays, its vogue for directors to translate cartoons and comic strips to the live movies.  sometimes they work mostly they don't.  this one does.<br />shot in day glo, this is a film noir in reverse.  the sets, clothes and makeup evoke that period somewhere between prohibition and the depression that inspired the comic. beatty stays true to the characters and the time period.<br />yes, the plot is simple but if you ever read the strip, there never was any real deptth to it, either.  tracey loved tess and hated crime - period.  he dealt w/ his both his nemesises - big boy caprice (al pacino) and his fear of true committment aka marridge to tess in every strip.  that's the point here - its a comic strip, after all.<br />i have enjoyed this movie every time i watch it - part of the fun is trying to guess the actor behind the makeup (which is awesome).  and no, i don't cheat !
0380973650|5.0|American Gods is about, well, american gods. And american myths, and the infinite variety of people and places that &quot;america&quot; encompasses. This is also Neil Gaiman, so along the way there are significant coincidences, and coincidences-that-aren't, and coincidences-that-REALLY-aren't, and plot twists that seem meaningless at the time but suddenly slot into place so seamlessly that you can't see how you missed the significance the first time around. Misdirection is a major theme of the book, from Shadow's coin tricks to Wednesday's con games and beyond-- another characteristic of America (and of course gods). And then just when you think Gaiman's exhausted his bag of tricks, the epilogue (set outside of the U.S.) throws a whole new light on the events of the book.<br /> If there's a problem with American Gods, it's that you'll have to read it three or four times to get everything-- and it will be a different book each time.

B00003CWPQ|1.0|... Do not be alarmed if the things you see and hear bear scant resemblance to other lands, or to life as you know it. You may be concerned that your color rods are freaking out, because the rich spectrum that you are used to is dissolving into a yinyang of orange and blue. You may see groups of people loitering together, in absolute stillness, for hours. You will hear NO overlapping dialogue; let us hope you are cool with this. Five minutes may pass between sentences, or between words in the same sentence. Archetypes (the untutored call them \\"cliches\\") out of centuries past will appear from thin air, uttering things like, \\"Have you ever read Ovid on the Art of Love?\\" in the tones of an Austrian Elmer Fudd.<br /> All of these things--like the expectant, churchly hush--are normal for Kubrick Country. It is a clean, vigilantly ordered land, like Singapore, except frigid and bare. Everything has a denatured smell, even the conversations, which sound as if a brilliant (and very patient) hermit has picked over the words for many years, like Madame Curie sifting through pitchblende ore. Throughout the decades of winnowing, every trace of Life (a messy, unstable element here) has been expunged in a principled quest for the perfect, radiant inner truth. But through some alchemical quirk, instead of luminous radium, the long sublimation has yielded a dull, generic loam, available anywhere. Which may be why it seemed so \\"true\\" to the wise hermit. Now, apply this arduous process to everything else: light, color, motion, decor, human interaction. Kubrick Country certainly looks like no other land, which may be its only point: it is difficult to compare it (unfavorably) with others.<br />The ruler of this land was once a very great king. Its valleys were rich, temperate, lovely. The royal consorts were a succession of slim, graceful, hip young beauties, radiant with humor, compassion, intelligence: everything their subjects could want in a Queen. But alas--something happened. No one seems to know quite what. The royal relationships grew more and more protracted and (paradoxically) sour. Perhaps the King should have remained a fleet-footed gadabout. The ninth Queen (nicknamed \\"the Orange\\") was a cruel, licentious rakehell, a major embarrassment to the King. So he traded her in for a puckered old bluestocking (with the mannish name \\"Barry\\") to whom no breath of scandal would attach. The next Queen (known far and wide as \\"the Shining One\\") was a joy: bright, funny, much loved. Sadly, she was deposed by a smirky, meretricious cretin in a chrome jacket, who claimed to be Vietnamese but was no more Asian than Nancy Sinatra in a geisha wig.<br />The late King's many genuflectors take the Maoist view that the Great Leader was by definition infallible, and that each of his wives was equally wonderful. It seems heartless to begrudge them this. Except: rational observers are now whispering that his thirteenth, and final, Queen is by far the ugliest of them all--indeed, one of the nastiest queens of any land, ever. Slow-witted, gauche, incontinent, yet drearily predictable, she moves in an inane coterie of court fools (sporting names like \\"Cruise Control\\" and \\"Kidding Man\\"), and has zero interest in humanity, beauty, truth or life. Concerned friends of the King even plotted to throttle this gewgaw in her sleep, before she could soil the King's good name; but none could ever tell if her vapid eyes were open or closed.<br />The grimmest part of this debacle may be the fate of the King's last true love. For it is widely held that, just before his death, he had wearied of his sallow, flatulent Queen and hoped to elevate a sweet ingenue (known by the initials A.I.) to her throne. That this was not allowed to happen is cause for great sadness, and suspicion.<br />What next befell A.I. defies description. Deprived of her protector, the child blundered into the sweaty hands of the Evil King: a voracious, manipulative Turk. Cowed by his repeated assertions that his \\"love is real,\\" she was coldly denuded of all virtue, intelligence, and sanity. Nothing now remains but a lifeless shell. It is said that the Evil King is secretly in cahoots with the satanic Queen--who wore the good King out and hastened his death with her slatternly provocations.<br /> This hag is still on the throne, and millions are grieving that their ruler's senile infatuation may have darkened their feelings for him forever. The evil that men do does live after them; particularly such elaborately made evil as this. The question is, what can you, as a visitor, do? ... Peaceful sanctions are your only moral option. You must renounce ALL association with the jejune Queen. You will behave as if she never existed. If others persist in believing in her, you will educate them. You will worship in her place the ideal of A.I. that never came to be--ignoring, for pity's sake, the defiled puppet who now bears that name. Shun the Evil Turk King and all his works.<br />On the day the usurpers' rotten, maggot-filled skulls gawk from flaming pikes above the palace gates, you will not dignify them with a glance.that his \\"love is real,\\" she was coldly denuded of all virtue, intelligence, and sanity.

B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard pretty much changed the way heavy metal was with their 'Pyromania' album. Then they follwed it up by changing the face of hard rock with 'Hysteria' The music is varied, with slow ballads like 'Love Bites' and 'Love and Affection' to riffs n screamming vocals songs as in 'Don't Shoot Shotgun','Run Riot'and 'Excitable' to amazing solos in 'Pour Some Sugar On Me'. One song that deserves a special mention is: Hysteria. The song isn't riffs and screams... it isn't even slow bluesy mourns... it's like a plateau. You know... the music is very level... like if you watched it on an equaliser, you'd hardly see any towers and depressions... it's 'consistant' and yet, it's a masterpiece. In fact, a recent poll on the Def Leppard website put Hysteria as their best song ever. Not supprising. Listen to the opening guitar riffs of 'Animal' and the way Joe Elliot open up with 'A wild ride... over stony ground.....' You end up over the moon. Another anthem is 'Gods of War'. The drums and guitar combination is awesome. This is one album that any proud rocker posseses.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Man, who'da thunk such a highly anticipated movie in one of the world's most beloved sagas would be so bloody awful? Who to blame? Lucas! After all, he had potloads of money to throw at the thing, the best SFX studio in the world, and nobody looking over his shoulder to tell him what to do. It's his baby, and it was stillborn. From the painfully racist characterizations, to the slow paced plot, to the pallid attempts at humor, this flick was a clunker from beginning to end. Only when the Jedis get into action does it begin to take off - unfortunately, there's only about fifteen minutes of such action here. Don't waste your time - check out the original trilogy (actually, the first two flicks) instead!
0060392886|5.0|Wow, this book was an all-around engrossing read!  I thing other reviewers summed it up pretty well, so I just have one new comment to make:  did anyone else find it a scream that Tommy and Pamela Lee were adamant about a &quot;natural, drug-free birth&quot; for their child?  I mean, these two take the prize for being as drug-addled and unnatural as they come!  Over the years, Mr. Lee proves again and again what a moronic, trendy wanna-be he is--witness his traiterous jump on the rap bandwagon, not to mention his gross negligence for recently letting a little boy drown at his kid's party.  On the positive side, however, my heart went out to Nikki, Vince, and Mick, and made me remember why this was one of my fave bands in the eighties.
B00003BDXG|5.0|Oliver Stone tries to capture one thing: he wants to show how America reacts to violence. Although he, himself, violently took the script away from Quentin Tarantino and changed almost everything except for the names, did a good job, I recommend this film to many Olvier Stone fans.<br />And if you pay attention, you don't see as much violence as you think. Oliver always has a way of doing that. If you liked this, I recommend Reservoir Dogs, Silence of the Lambs and for Oliver Stone fans, Platoon, which if you are a fan, you should of already seen it!
0792838084|2.0|Beautifully filmed, but utterly stupid in its meandering and dumb plot. I'd love to smack Kyle MacLachlan's character over the head about fifty times with a rubber mallet. He may well be the single most stupid and naive dolt in all of cinema and I'm not sure that Lynch meant to make him quite that stupid.<br />Movie tries to be cool and creepy and weird (&quot;Hey, small towns have strange people in them, too!&quot;) Whoopee-stinkin'-doo, I say. <br />I had an acquaintance who used to say &quot;I hate weirdness that exists for weirdness' sake only.&quot; Now I know what he meant. Pass.
006107327X|5.0|Perhaps the perfect animation book, this covers the original animated series in great detail, with more preproduction work and cel-repros than can be comfortably digested in a single sitting. Now, perhaps we can hope for a similar book for series 2 or perhaps Batman Beyond?
B000003S2O|5.0|Good ambient music creates a distinctive mood, a world all its own ... Eno has definitely accomplished that here.  Atmospheric, haunting, yet strangely comforting, &quot;On Land&quot; takes you away from your stereo and gently lands you on the surface of a distant planet.  You can almost feel oddly-shaped eyes looking at you, checking you over -- but you get the idea They probably won't hurt you.  Probably.  A masterful bit of work.  <br />Another feature of good ambient music (and one that is very rarely actually accomplished) is that it is very interesting to actually listen to.  Eno subtly mixes the textures and colors here to give you a varied listening experience.  Each piece even has its own &quot;shape,&quot; just like a piece of more formally composed, conventional music -- yet the structure is delicately hidden and never made too apparent.  As a result, there is -- in a very unique way -- passion and even drama throughout.<br />In short, you can zone out to it, or you can listen intently to it -- and it will become a part of your life.  Every morning at work, this is the first CD I play.  I find it refreshing and stimulating to wake to Eno's world each day, as I also wake to my own.  On the best days, both worlds seem one and the same.<br />Highly recommended as one of those CDs that will sound like nothing else in your collection and will always find its way to the top of the pile.
0783225970|5.0|The rise and fall of an American gangster. Brian DePalma's Scarface has to be the best rise and fall gangster film since the original. The chainsaw scene was widely talked about when the film first appeared in 1983. Critics raved angrily about the amount of violence portrayed. But, you don't see as much violence as you think. You never actually witness the gore of the chainsaw cutting through (...). It's mainly the blood just oozing. Brian DePalma couldn't have shown it better (Although the way you see it isn't the actual way the script was written). Some facts:<br />- Al Pacino states this was ONE of his favorite movies.<br />- When writing this script in Paris, Oliver Stone said that it was his 'Farewell To Cocaine'.<br />- Watching Carlito's Way, where Al Pacino and Brian DePalma both teamed up again, you'll find many of the same actor's who starred in Scarface.<br />- The Executive Producer, Barbera DeFina also produced Ordinary People. Producer Marty Bregman had also produced Taxi Driver and Dog Day Afternoon.<br />If you've seen Scarface before, and you liked it, don't be stupid. Watch it again.
B00005B4GU|5.0|There is no coming back for Radiohead. Thom Yorke and Co. have been abducted by flying saucers and the only way for you to hear this album is to rocket away to Mars or take a walk through the rings of Saturn with your girlfriend from another planet. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; follows the same tracks as the band's previous one, the strange, atmospheric, yet admirable, &quot;Kid A&quot;. For those who have been following Radiohead's career since &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; this CD might sound, literally, out of tune, strange; but one who has known the Oxford band most recently(like myself)it is absolutely wonderful to see how they have managed to follow their hearts and not let comercialism take over their music. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is brilliant from the first to the last track; a rich and consistent piece of art; a surprising and beautiful collection of songs from one of the greatest bands in the world. This is a CD to be listened with eyes closed, preferebly in the dark, sharing your most deep secrets.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This is an exceptional CD, very imaginative. I've listened to it twice and it sounds even better the second time. I have read some of the negative reviews and it seems that some critics don't want Radiohead to develop musically, just keep doing the same old thing like most pop music groups. That is always a big mistake.
B000021XR5|3.0|STP is a band I've followed ever since I first heard &quot;Plush&quot; onthe radio as a freshman in highschool.  I alwyas look forward to their releases, and, when I heard they released No. 4, I went out and bought it immediately.<br />I like a few of the songs on the CD, but musical complexity, in my opinion, is largely absent from this album.  What I enjoy about STP is their good guitar parts and dynamic sound....this album just kinda seemed like a punch in the stomach.  &quot;Down&quot; just didn't captivate me like &quot;Big Bang Baby,&quot; &quot;Plush,&quot; or &quot;7 Caged Tigers&quot; did.<br />This album is heavier and less musical than Core.  Anyways, I guess most people do like this album, but I have to cast my dissenting vote.  You're better off buying STP's other albums.
0783225792|4.0|There are not many crime films that capture the same feeling that Goodfellas, The Godfather and Casino share. Casino is all about betrayel. I don't want to spoil anything. All I want to share with you, is how wonderful the appearences from Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone are. They make you want to be there while the story goes on. When you get to see the other side of the story, where Sharon wants Joe Pesci to kill his bestfriend, Robert DeNiro, Joe (even though Sharon is cheating on Robert with him) refuses. But, in the end, all I can say is, everybody gets what they deserved.
0440539811|4.0|...personally this book has made me feel more inspired than ever to explore all the possibilities of life... far from escaping some ficticious \\"reality\\" ...i seek to illuminate my own reality in new and endless dimensions.  this expands the imagination on all frontiers from politics to spirituality to sexuality... this book covers nearly everything important to being alive!  it presents things in a chaotic fashion which will certainly spin your head around and intoxicate you.  if you have an open mind (even somewhat open), read this book!!
0767903862|5.0|Exploring foreign lands through the books of Bill Bryson is such fun! Australia comes alive in this captivating book full of fascinating facts, entertaining information and hilarious anecdotes by an author whose self-deprecating sense of humor makes him unique among travel writers. I have read all his books at least twice, including this one, and can hardly wait for his next one! Definitely 5 big stars for this one!

B00005A3KS|2.0|I'm a die hard fan of Ms. Bigelow's films, specially this one. I've been expecting it's release ever since DVD's been out!, but for starters: there's not even an animated menu, the extras are nothing but trailers, especially that 3 minute featurette, they don't even mention or show anything that's really something you could call a featurette. And also, when I reached chapter 10 that dual layer pause just freezed!, I passed then to chapter 11 just so that I could scan back to chapter 10 and then my DVD freezed completely. I sent Amazon my comments, and I got another DVD. To my surprise that same thing happened again and again. If someone has the same problem as me, please let me know so that  the guys at Fox replace us with our money. Anyway, besides that, the flick is still great!
0440219078|4.0|I think \\"The Giver\\" is a story which throws you into the action at the beginning and leaves questions behind at the end ,so it's quite exciting. The community and all the people living inside it are cut off from the world we would today call reality. Readind from chapter to chapter, you will learn all about the secrets of the community, step by step, and finally there will be a big surprise.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This was by far the best movie I saw this year. In addition to its musical, comedic, and acting merits, I wanted to point out its literary merits, which are slightly underneath the surface but are there nonetheless if you are looking for them. <br /> This movie is not merely an adaptation of The Odyssey, it is a very viable literary interpretation of it. Bringing out Ulysses' vanity, self-reliance, and persuasuve ability as well as Penelope's stubbornness and fickle nature, which this film does beautifully, have been important in all interpretations of the classical poem. <br />Satire of the work is also not lost on the Coens. Ulysses is transformed from the sacker of Troy to a fraudulent lawyer, his athletic prowess turns into him getting beaten up by a weakly looking suitor, and even the authors' use of the name Homer is intended and appropriately satiric. (for a full-of-himself politician who looks out for &quot;the little man&quot;)<br />For those who think that this is indeed merely a loose adaptation and that the events and persons of the Odyssey are not put into this movie, I would contend that they are very much mistaken. <br />Without giving anything away, I would challenge viewers to find the Coens' interpretation of all of the following characters from the poem (the first few are easy): Odysseus, Penelope, the Sirens, the Cyclops, Circe (and her turning of Ulysses' men into animals), the Cattle of the Sun, King Alcinous of Phaecia, the angry god Poseidon (who here is also the ruler of Hades), the ghosts of Hades, the Lotus Eaters, Aeolus, the Laestrygonians, Alcinous' blind bard Demodocus, Eurylochus (Ulysses' unfaithful first-mate), Elpenor (his man who he meets in Hades), Telemachus, and Eumaeus the swineherd, Tiresias (the blind seer of Hades), the suitors Eurymachus and Antinous, and finally the representations of the monstrous Scylla and the water guzzling Charybdis. <br />They are all there. I'm not making them up. Watch the movie again if you haveto. Good luck and enjoy!
B00005B36H|4.0|i was never a big tool fan.this is the first tool record i bought.it took some time to grow on me and i find it very amusing.the way maynard uses his vocals and the guitar is really heavy with the crazy bass drums in the background.i bought it because i was looking for a good meatal cd since i'm a metal fan.i picked this up because i like the radio hit &quot;Schism&quot; and i heard good things about it.pick this record up next time your checking out the metal section.it's good for your money.good songs are &quot;Parobola&quot;,&quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot;,&quot;The Grudge&quot;,&quot;Lateralus&quot;,and of coarse &quot;Schism&quot;.
B000056K04|2.0|I hear many Dave Matthews Band fans remarking on how original it is to have horns, violin and other instruments taking center stage at a rock concert. Like Dave Matthews invented this format or something. Ever hear of Van Morrison? It's been done. And there is not much originality to Matthews voice either, he sound like a odd mix of Sting and Peter Gabriel. I think that this band is getting so much acclaim because there are so few good bands out there. We are inundated with Britney Spears and the like. DMB have some good songs, but their albums are not great and Everyday is probably the worst. If you prefer the real thing don't waste your time with these imitators.
1559408758|5.0|It's a classic and the hour+ of outtakes, and 2 commentary tracks help add to the depth of the movie, and some of the outtakes show that the real movie was only a SMALL portion of what was conceived for this brilliant piss-take of a film.  Rarely have non-Brits been so good at being British!  And all the rock and roll allusions.  Fantastic.  This is an older DVD and the new one has in-character commentary which could be good, but as for insight I think the out of character stuff is better.  So classic that you should have bought it and watched it 5 years ago!
0060392886|5.0|Let's see... Where do I begin? I'd have to say that this book was one of the most entertaining reads for me in a while. It is amazing that the Motleys aren't dead or in prison right now. I kept thinking that these guys are either the luckiest mofos in the history of  the planet, or they sold their souls to the devil.  Mere mortals would be  dead within a year if they indulged in the abuse that the Motleys unleashed  upon themselves and those around them.<br />Even if their tales are only half truths, it is still mind-boggling. Most of their exploits consist mainly of boinking hot chicks, or OD-ing on drugs and alcohol. Once in a while they'll throw in a fist fight or two for good measure. Even when they weren't looking for trouble, it seemed trouble would always look for them.<br />\\"The Dirt\\" is by no means an intellectual stimulator. I wanted to read this book because I was curious about the whole rock 'n' roll lifestyle. And believe me, Motley Crue took the cliche of \\"sex, drugs & rock 'n' roll\\" to the limit. If you're a fan of theirs (as I was in the mid 80s), \\"The Dirt\\" should definitely be on your bookshelf.

B000002IZM|5.0|I was ecstatic when this disc first appeared back in 1994.  Till then the only source for Blade Runner music was the Vangelis compilation &quot;Themes&quot; and the orchestral adaptation disc released around the time of the film, and the Off World Music bootleg.  Vangelis did a wonderful job here, providing many of the tracks heard in the film as well as including some new music (&quot;Blush Response&quot;, &quot;Rachel's Song&quot;, etc.) A few snippets of dialogue are even thrown in for a nice effect that is not intrusive on the music.  I believe the most complete sources for Blade Runner music are still the bootlegs that appeared in the early-mid 90s.  The Off World Music release has tracks entirely absent from this offical disc, including &quot;The Prodigal Son Brings Death&quot; and &quot;Wounded Animals&quot; as well as the complete music from the opening credits.  Then there was the Gongo Music release that was very similar to the Off World disc but also included &quot;Blimpvert&quot;, the Japanese song heard briefly while the blimp flies overhead.  Nevertheless, Vangelis has done some of his finest work on the soundtrack, and the offical release was much appreciated by die-hard fans.  Reknowned DJ Paul Oakenfold recently included a couple of these tracks on his Perfecto Presents Another World double disc set.  Perhaps Vangelis will release a second CD with the rest of the Blade Runner score.
B000002U82|5.0|Magic.  Incredible music flows out of this abstract, deep piece of artwork.  How did they do this? No one knows.  Pink Floyd once again show us that they are the greatest band of all times, with the possible exception of The Beatles.  Right from the beggining, that sudden explosion of chilled out (yet not!) music takes you into a world of feelings and passions; the story of modern life and it's incongruences.  An absolute must for anyone who claims to be a human being! enjoy this CD.  I doubt you will ever find a more intelligent one.
B000002LRX|5.0|Like many fans, I too was upset that FNM decided not to make The Real Thing part deux.  I also believed that they had decided to get a new lead singer, and that they would probably become a band who decided to get a new singer with each album...I know that sounds odd, but that's the way it appeared to me.  I was wrong and I was right.  I like the mad scientist tag that a previous reviewer gave Patton, because I picture him sitting in a basement with all these concoctions gurgling in his brain, wringing his hands together, deciding how best to mess with our brains.  What may be a better tag is &quot;The Chameleon&quot; shapeshifting with each song, or the abstract artist who slaps paint on a canvas in a seemingly disoriented fashion until one takes a step back.  Whatever the case may be, I couldn't go back to The Real Thing ever again.  This album, as many have stated, started an industry.  Many have tried and many have failed to attempt to duplicate the brilliance found on this disc.  King for a Day, Album of the Year, Mr. Bungle, and Fantomas have done what Mike Patton has feared the most...They have made him a LEGEND.  My one problem with Patton is that he was not as prolific as I would've liked him to be, coming out with a paltry! 11 albums in 12 years.  He appears to be allieving my angst by coming out with four albums this year.  The Director's Cut (Fantomas) another Fantomas album (as yet untitled) an album with a group called Peeping Tom, and another album with a group called Tomahawk.   The epitome of genius, that Mike Patton is, shone forth in this album first sports fans, and if you want to hear Mike Patton 101 this is it.
0790744295|5.0|Great fun! Based on a comic book this movie is spooky, hilarious(they were all a little funny to me but the one with the meteor gives me a good laugh everytime I see it), and overall, a lot of fun. I like to watch this movie with my friends and eat and laugh and have a great time. :)
0525457585|5.0|I first read this book as a teenager, and it should be required reading for anyone with an imagination. I was so glad to see an edition with the original two-color text incorporated. I'd contemplated buying the book for a long time, but could never find a copy with the red and green text. I'm very pleased to add it to my collection now.
0679879269|1.0|I loved The Golden Compass. I also enjoyed the Subtle Knife a lot, but not as unreservedly as the former because of some minor flaws These flaws were magnified much more in The Amber Spyglass, so that I found it very disappointing.<br />On the literary level, this book's main flaw was that it was too ponderous and slow. Soon after beginning it, I was bored and only continued reading it because I wanted to see if Mr. Pullman could pull the conclusion of his trilogy out of the mess he had gotten it into.<br />The main problem is that the plot is convoluted and meandering to the point of lacking direction. This exacerbates the fact that the book becomes too descriptive. In the earlier installments of the trilogy, this was a strength because Pullman's rich language did what all our English teachers always told us to do - they painted a picture and appealed to all the other senses as well. Here also it was often beautiful (in descriptions of landscapes, or of the simple pleasures of taste and smell) but it became too much of a good thing. By itself, that would have been a rather minor flaw, but the languid pace made it almost unbearable.<br />I was also curious to see the development and full exposition of the philosophical ideas Pullman introduced. I am a Christian, and Pullman's beliefs are opposite mine in most respects. I tried to approach the book with an open mind, but it is difficult when the author doesn't have an open mind himself. Essentially, the thing that bothered me most about Pullman's philosophy wasn't that it was anti-religious and anti-Christian, but that he didn't even give Christianity a fair chance (here he can take a lesson from Dostoyevsky, who in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; seems to overstate the case against Christianity although he is attempting to show its truth). Everyone associated with God in the book is evil, either deceitful snakes like Mrs. Coulter or self-righteous zealots like Fr. McPhail and Fr. Gomez; there are no humble and holy people (while there are such people in the world). Also, he presents a picture of a warped dualist Christianity that is akin to the Inquisition rather than the true Orthodox faith which teaches unselfish love and blesses material things as good while teaching moderation in all things.<br />Finally, one is confronted with a problem that appears in all secular humanist thought: despair. Pullman essentially tells us to enjoy life and not inhibit our desires and that's it; after death there is only oblivion (which to me seems worse than even the gloomy underworld he depicts). Although the hope of eternal life that Christianity offers is not proof of its truth, at least it can be said that it is more beautiful and joyful than the heartless, eventually meaningless existence promised by humanism.ly people (while there are such people in the world).

B00005BJ2O|3.0|A long long time ago you could go and see a movie musical, and then you could go to the local record store and buy the soundtrack, and the soundtrack would contain all the songs in the movie.  Gone are those carefree days when movies were nothing more than freestanding pieces of entertainment that weren't cross marketed by multinational parent companies.  Now when you buy a soundtrack there's no telling what you'll get.  That being said, the Moulin Rouge soundtrack comes very close, containing roughly 65% of the songs in the movie.  The songs I wanted most (Like a Virgin, Spectacular Spectacular, The Show must Go On, the haunting closing credit music) are not here.  I love the movie, and I love the songs that are here (I'm sorry, but Nicole Kidman can sing way better than Lil' Kim) but overall I'm disappointed in yet another incomplete soundtrack.
B000003TA4|5.0|I went through a period where I absolutely hated Nirvana.  I must have burnt myself out on them in 6th grade b/c I listened to them religiously for about six months.  At the time I didn't understand why I liked them so much, but now I do.  These are some of the most brilliantly crafted melodies and harmonies to ever grace a rock record.  This is in fact why the album is so innovative for its time.  It proved that hard, punk-like, angst-filled music could be melodic and accessible.  It made grunge a not only respectable type of music, but popular as well.  This is why people identify w/ it so well.  The lyrics are filled w/ angst and despair, but the songs can be sung in the shower.  In other words, Nirvana is essentially, The Beatles of 90's rock.   All right, enough critic-talk, let's discuss why I personal like this cd.  Basically, I just like the music.  It's gripping, catchy, and extremely addictive.  I could listen to these songs over and over (which I find myself doing sometimes) and never get bored or annoyed w/ them.  Currently, &quot;Drain You&quot; and &quot;On a Plain&quot; catch my ear.  They have some great harmonic work and brilliant chord progressions.  As for the lyrics, I can't really say I personally identify w/ them just b/c I'm generally a pretty carefree, happy-go-lucky kind of person (also, I'm out of my rebellious teen stage).  However, I can understand how a young teen would identify w/ Cobain's lyrics.  Kurt seems to speak for the youth w/ his haunting words of confusion, anger, and despair.  This doesn't mean I agree w/ him, b/c I believe that if you have Jesus Christ in your heart, then you have no reason to be angry, but I can sympathize.   Nevermind hasn't aged a day since its release, and decades from now, I imagine it will still be considered the modern-day classic that it is due to its vision.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is U2's best album ever.  Only Achtung Baby comes close (but very close).  The album is full of Bono's best lyrics of his career.  His writing made the songs what they are.      It starts of with &quot;Where the Streets have no name&quot;, one of my favorites songs.  The verses are very well thought out, but the chorus is the highlight of the piece.  Here you have Bono belting out his wonderful lyrics, not missing a note.  This is a great song.  Next comes one of U2's most well known songs, &quot;Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;.  This is one of the many U2 hits that is played a lot on the radio, and when you catch it on, you have to listen to it, just like the next song on the album &quot;With or Without You&quot;.  It's my favorite song ever.  You can acctually feel what Bono is saying, and you emediately start singing along.  It's a really terrific song.  They don't get much better than that.     &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; is a very political song dealing with what is going on at the time.  Definately the black sheep of the record, and the perfect addition.  Now &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; calms out and takes a rest with &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;.  It's not the best song on the album, but it's in the perfect place at the perfect time.  After &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;  and &quot;Where the Streets have no name&quot; this mellow piece is the perfect rest stop.     The rest of the album is pretty [U2ish]  with some excelent songs like &quot;Red Hill minig Town&quot; and Trip Through Your Wires&quot;.  But one song stuck out from the rest, &quot;Mothers of the Dissapeared&quot;, What a wonderfull song.  It paints such a vivid picture in your head that almost brought me to tears the first time hearing it.       So, whether of not this review helped or not, at least go away with one thought.  If you are even the least of a u2 fan, and you don't have this album, you need to get your act together.
6301963717|5.0|This was one of the first in the 90's wave of slick, reconstructed gangster/crime films (the Tarantino/Ritchie oeuvre, Usual Suspects, et al), and really the best.  Gabriel Byrne's Hamlet-like advisor plays against Albert Finney's Sonny Corleone-like boss, double- and triple-crossing his way through threats, fists, gunfire, and Marcia Gay Harden's right hook into a big payday and said Ms. Harden's arms.  A classic noir-style protagonist, Byrne's Tom Reagan is hard-boiled and gets harder as the film progresses.  <br />Though supposedly loosely based on &quot;The Glass Key&quot; by Dashiell Hammett, there is a lot of James Cain's &quot;Love's Lovely Counterfeit&quot; thrown in, including much of the sparkling dialogue (&quot;Hey, Tom, Bernie's been lookin' for ya.&quot;  &quot;Well, I'm right here, I'm not made of glass.&quot;).  It definitely has the Coen touch with some quirky characters and wait-for-it humor, but these touches only add to the charm and texture of the Prohibition-era story.  Watch closely for cameos (Sam Raimi) and Coen-world continuity (is Tom really the Barton Fink?).<br />The only Coen Brothers film not currently on DVD are Barton Fink and this one.  Someone needs to do something about this.
0792156684|5.0|TITANIC is one of the greatest love stories ever told whether you like it or not. Sure, it may not be as popular as it was back in '97 or '98...but every movie loses it's popularity at least at some point in time. Still, nobody has forgotten the epic love affair between Jack Dawson and Rose DuWitt Bukater. And many people still enjoy watching this movie over and over again on VHS or DVD. And nobody has forgotten the thrills and chills during the Sinking Sequence of the film. This was the one time when the Oscars didn't make a mistake giving 11 Academy Awards to TITANIC including Best Picture. The acting wasn't all that bad as everybody thought it was, either. And the special effects are specatacular and incredible. I still think TITANIC deserved every single one of the Oscars the film won. And this film wasn't really supposed to be about the TITANIC itself, it really was based on Jack and Rose. Forget the trashy reviews that don't even know what a good love story is and go see TITANIC for yourself (if you haven't already) and you'll see why this film ever became so popular.
0679879269|3.0|Books one and two kept me wondering: are these books good or evil?  The Amber Spyglass put an end to my wondering.  Philip Pullman has a definite religious &quot;chip&quot; on his shoulder.  What's his problem?  I agree with the lady's review where she said that he trusted our intelligence throughout the first part of the book, but then beat his warped opinions into our heads in the end.  I'm angered to think that a man would write a &quot;children's&quot; book with the final theme being sexual consummation of a twelve and thriteen year old boy and girl.  Really!  I bought the Golden Compass for my teenage daughter from the school's book fair.  I try to read everything that my daughter reads (for obvious reasons).  The fantasy level of the Golden Compass was fantastic (I love C.S. Lewis). Every child could imagine what their daemon might be.  So I was curious enough to get the second and third books.  Philip Pullman is going to ultimately be accountable before the Almighty (whom he wants his readers to believe is dead) for leading children astray.  Woe to Philip Pullman.  I only gave the book a three star rating because of the imagination and clear descriptions of the characters and different worlds.  The end of the trilogy is a shame.
B00000J7SS|2.0|Perhaps even more strange and depressing than this album is the praise some have heaped on it. Bitches Brew is like a glass of vinegar on a hot day--flavorful, but don't say it's good. Fine trumpeter, seminal jazz theoretician and general egomaniac that Miles Davis was, by the time BB came to fruition he was in the grip of a personal mutation that clearly affected his mind and music. While BB IS energetic and unusual, it is also strident, acidic and perversely disharmonic--which is undoubtedly what MD, given his mental state at the time, wanted. BB overflows with tediously long and directionless sets. Davis blares one wasted solo after another into a reverb while guitarist John McLaughlin soars off into other astral planes. Chick Corea meanders furiously up and down the keyboard of his Fender Rhodes looking for the right key, which Miles has kept hidden from him...one could go on almost forever. Somehow, incredibly, the drummers manage to keep the beat, bringing some fundamental order to this primal chaos. It's hard to come to grips with Bitches Brew. Yes, it's declaratory and innovative...and sucks! Was Davis being boldly visionary in this fusion of jazz and rock? Or was he in the throes of a narcissistic rage? Let's give him the benefit of the doubt--and an extra star. Still, I can only recommend BB in the sense that one may listen to it and learn just how bad things CAN get.
B00004YKUY|3.0|I was hopeful and have heard good things.  I like Steve Augeri's voice, however, he's not Steve Perry.  No where near the upper range that Perry has.  Augeri sounds more like a mix of Steve Perry, Bryan Adams, and Rod Stewart - he's got a great voice.  For the old time Journey lovers, let's face the facts, Perry is gone, Augeri is here...I just wish the producers would decide to mix the next album with more voice the way it used to be.  The mix on this album is all jumbled together and I can barely make out many of the words because the vocalist is no longer the center of attention.  In prior albums there was a much clearer mix of each band member...not the case on this album.  It's still good music though.
0790729725|1.0|GOODFELLAS itself is worth five stars easily, but this is me complaining about the DVD again. What in God's name is this flipping stuff? The movie actually stops halfway through and you have to flip the thing over to continue watching it! Can it be possible that we've actually REGRESSED to where the VHS version is superior than the DVD? I mean, cripes. It's not like they couldn't have fit the entire movie onto one side. It's a 140 minute movie, whereas the SOPRANOS DVD easily fits four 50-minute episodes on one side. Something is seriously messed up.<br />And what's with the lack of extras? Two trailers is all we get? GOODFELLAS needs to be thrown back on the pile of DVDs that need to be released as a Criterion Edition, toot suite.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I pitty the poor un-intelectually advanced people who tryd to sit threw this movie. I unfortenetly have had to sit and read about 80 reviews of people with horrible grammer and spelling (I know, mine isnt the best either, but still...) who didnt seem to know what was going on. So, let me start off by giving you people the fly-bye. 3 storys. A Lovely wife pregnate with 1 child and has another. Two cops working to take a huge chunk out of the drug bussines. And one cop, torn between his beloved corupt homeland of mexico, and America, this one being in most peoples opinions, the best acting job of the movie, if not the most fascinating. With the basic plot, ill procceed to explain why it was such a Fantastic movie. 1st pitch, and its a homerun. The soundtrack is a brilliant match to the movies. Seldom, can you say a movie's soundtrack is like the roof, protecting it if anything caves in, and the soundtrack does just that. From the soothing cord music, to the heart thumping techno beats. This soundtrack is amazing, and should be owned even if you havent seen the movie, and when you put a awsome movie, with great background, thats instant victory over anybody who sees the movies heart. Then, for the walls, we have the beautifull camera and color techniques, that should be used in every movie. Our awsome director, had the brilliance to put colors, not just backgrounds, but colores in the backgrounds, sometimes maybye to strong, but still very good adition. He often uses these to show emotion, and n'sync with the soundtrack, wich makes it that much better. Example you ask? Sure, the scenes in mexico where everything has a tint of yellow? Haza, we have a dusty landscape that feels slightly corrupt. Heck, i doubt we need actors when colors can potray these. Well, i feel iv filled my space, so I hope youll go out and see/rent if not buy this spectaculare movie, sure to be the equial to movies such as..... Well, I cant think of any movies that you can think back to compare, this is a break through in music, cinamatography, and acting. Its a thing we only see a couple times a year if that.
B000002KCC|5.0|When I first came across the music of NY, it was Harvest from them BMG deals. Some people say THAT was his best album, &amp; they are probably right.... commercially. Then I came across this album... which I thought was utter dung. It sat collecting dust until I came across an article in some magazine covering this era of NY's life. <br />After doing some background checking, you begin to realize how brutually honest this album is. The &quot;music biz&quot; folks must have thought this album was garbage, but folks, this might be as &quot;open&quot; as the enigmatic Neil will ever get with us fans. I think the title track is brilliant.... in a Neil Young sort of way. I wouldn't recommend this album to the beginner NY fan, but this is an essential album in understanding how far Neil Young was willing to push his buttons. It's not for the light hearted, but the good stuff usually never is.<br />An added bonus is some great playing by Nils Lofgren. If you've indulged yourself in Neil Young, check this album out. He hasn't done an album like this since.
0440219078|3.0|The Book &quot;The Giver&quot; plays in the future. There is a community which is ruled by a Receiver and some elders who tells the inhabitants what to do. One of these inhabitants is Jonas who is selected to take over the most important job in the community. I didn't like the book very much because I don't like such unreal stories. I think the author wrote too much unrealistic things, for example I can't understand why the community has developed into what they are in the story. Many things that are part of over our lives were abolished (also all dangers) and I can't quite understand why...<br />Metal Rulez !!!
0790749815|5.0|After seeing some other Hitchcock films on television like Vertigo, Psycho, and Rope, I decided to purchase North By Northwest.<br />At first, I was afraid that the DVD would be less than perfect, but I was very wrong.<br />The picture quality is outstanding. The colors are dead-on accurate and detail is everywhere. The letterboxing acheives a nice frame, the way the film was intended for. The sound is crystal clear and sounds better than theater quality.<br />The extras are also excellent. The documentary is very entertaining and informative, as is the commentary by Ernest Lehman. The trailers and TV spots are interesting because of their vintage quality. (The Hitchcock trailer is neat.) The photo gallery offers some neat photographs (nearly 40!). The inclusion of spanish and french audio tracks is great so that more people can be introduced to this excellent film. The music-only track is great since Bernard Herrmann's score is exquisitely great.<br />As with most Warner DVD's, the movie has a high number of chapter stops, which allows more access to scenes in the movie. The film is also enhanced for widescreen televisions, which makes the quality even better. Warners has a tastefully short and simple DVD intro with their company logo that lets you get to the movie quickly unlike Disney/Touchstone DVD's.<br />Warners knows that people want the main attraction, the film, and they satisfy that want. Also, the DVD cover is nice and comes in a simple snapper case, which is less likely to damage the disc.<br />This film has everything you could want from a movie...<br />Action, Romance, Suspense, Humor, Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, clever script by Lehman... and of course, Alfred Hitchcock's direction.<br />If you're wondering if you should purchase this fine DVD, don't hesitate.
0887307876|5.0|I work with a telco in Europe. we don't have cubicles over here, but we have mission statements, reengineering, quality management and consultants. we proactively leverage change and continuously reconcile our paradigms with what's trendy in our market-driven environ... er, forget it. read this book!
B00003CX5P|4.0|You know there are many a people out there who bash this movie relentlessly.  Ease up, this was a pretty solid, and definately entertaining movie.  I understand where the people who didn't like it come from, yes at times it seemed to be made for a much younger audience and yes Jar Jar is annoying as all hell.     But this is still a very well put together and great movie.  There are people who also dislike the so called &quot;new star wars.&quot;  But you have to understand, Lucas wrote these movie's years ago.  And he wrote them in order all together.  So this is the true start of his vision.   If you can suck it up and manage to suffer through a few stupid Jar Jar lines, then you will really enjoy this movie.  Which &quot;YES&quot; is good enough to be placed next to episodes 4,5 and 6.
B000002VTE|5.0|This is an album that must be experienced as a whole, late some night when your thoughts are all your own.  And if you don't get it the first time, please give it another chance.  \\"I Think I'm In Love\\" is one of those wonderfully catchy songs that will stay in your head for weeks, while standing up wonderfully to repeated listenings.  \\"Cop Shoot Cop\\" is a sprawling epic, but worth all 17-odd minutes it requires.  And \\"Electricity\\" and \\"Come Together\\" will have you bobbing your head incessantly every time you hear them.  Each song on the rest of the album, while being very diverse, still feels like an integral part of a whole.  This one has been in heavy rotation for months, and won't be going back in its case anytime soon....
B00000251N|5.0|I have had a long time love affair with themusic of Neil Diamond and this is one of his best. Stressed? Feeling down? Turn offthe lights and turn on the music. Feel thestress leave in waves. For those who justlove the music, turn it on, close your eyesand let Johathon take over. With this CDyou can fly!
B000050XEI|3.0|There is some good and original stuff here, but I have to say that the first half of this release sounds like recycled songs from previous albums. I am starting to think Enya has only about a dozen songs in her head that continually reappear in slightly altered forms. True fans will enjoy it though. You can't get enough of a good thing, right?
B00000J8EK|5.0|This is one of the most wonderful collections of modern audio I have had the privilege to witness.  From beginning to end, this masterpiece is without a doubt, hands down, the electronic album for the ages. #1 on my all-time album list, this would be the one to take if you were to be stranded on a desert island for the rest of your life with a CD player and a lifetime supply of double A's. It's hard not to find a track here you won't be addicted to.  Every melody and every beat is molded and cut from (what can only be hailed as) a miracle of sound. Whatever the Chemical Brothers did to compose this piece of art, I pray, they can replicate in the future.  This is a mandatory must-have for anyone into the techno-dance scene -- and even if you're not, please, please, please take a chance and listen to this one...I can't imagine how you could possibly be disappointed. There certainly aren't enough praiseful adjectives to describe this work.  I know God must have it next to his stereo in the sky.
B00004XOWM|2.0|\\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water\\"<br />I guess our boy Fred Durst was trying to go after some kind of \\"alter ego\\" experience (i don't know) a la David Bowie (Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars)...what a dumb name though... He claims he is \\"Chocolate Starfish\\" and the band is \\"the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\"... ok then, Fred.<br />I didn't even mind some of Bizkits \\"older stuff\\" and would even get some head noddin' action to \\"radio favorites\\" like the beefed up George Michael 87 hit \\"faith\\" and the raw power of \\"nookie\\"... but this appeal lasts only so long...<br />His whiny voice plagues the tracks on this album... while they could be tolerated on previous efforts, his whine seems to be accentuated on this flop.<br />The only decent tracks that might get the \\"teen angst-pimple ragers\\" going might be \\"Take a Look Around\\" and \\"Rollin'\\" (which is a bad track..) overall, this album falls short of previous efforts and the bar raised by such acts as even the lowely \\"Kid Rock\\" (who sucks now without his midget sidekick)... In this type of music, check out maybe Filter, or old punk bands like Stiff Little Fingers... As for this album, Skip it. You hear? PEAAACE!
B00005BL2A|4.0|No, it's not their best work. However, I think that DM is moving away from their more popular dancey tunes. Let's face it, they are no longer in their 20s and they have grown up. It's time to settle down, drink a glass of wine, and absorb the thought-provoking lyrics and beautiful music.
B0000024RQ|5.0|unquestionably the most compelling Dylan album.  stripped down and unbelievably complex.  a fun listen and at the same time loaded with dylanesque intensity.  ...<br />\\"Oxford Town\\" & \\"Talking WW III Blues\\" are the backbone of this album.  Oxford Town says more in 2 minutes than most artists can say in their entire career.  i find myself emotionally driven each and every time i listen to this unfaded, gorgeous work.<br />HAPPY 60th BOB!!!
B000002UA5|4.0|And sit back and listen to this album.  Granted, it doesn't have much melody, but what it lacks in finesse it makes up for in ingenuity.  It's interesting to hear what sound comes next - a nice change in a world of all too predictable (not to mention stylistically orthodox) music.<br />Sysyphus Part III is strange piece of sounds . . . scare your friends who listen to 21st century homgenized radio friendly music!  The Grand Vizier's Garden Party songs, though, are somewhat boring.<br />Enjoy.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I dont know who these dumbasses are who think this movie sucs, but let me ust tell you they are complete morons.  This is probably up there in the top 100 movies of all time.  Its in my personal top 5.  Look, it was exciting.  True, it wasn't a movie where they go around beating people up, but there was a good amount of harddcore fighting.  Yet, it also managed to keep an incredibly interesting plot throughout, with a surprise ending as good as that in the sixth sense.  Yet, on top of all taht, it's funny!  Yes, there are some truly funny parts in this movie.  I can't see why anybody wouldn't like it.  So, if you're willing to try something new, and get a terrific blend of action, and deep htought buy this movie now!
B00005LB9O|5.0|This isn't 'The Man Who - The Saga Continues'.  One listen to 'The Last Train' (track 9) will tell you that.  This track ALONE is worth spending a few bones to get this disc!  Check the BIG fat compression on Doug's bass, DAMN.   And your girlfriend will tell you she's leaving you for Fran (if she ever meets him).
B00003CXRP|5.0|After the gutsy first five minutes of &quot;Contact&quot; (showing how insignificant we all are on this little planet!), director Zemeckis outdoes himself with &quot;CastAway&quot; with many inventive and exhilarating scenes of loss, joy, and a little madness.  Hanks delivers an indelible character who runs the gamut of emotions and physical torment in over two hours.  The DVD has exceptional sound/picture.  One of the pure joys was Zemeckis' decision not to use music; only the sounds of the ocean and nature take precedent and shape the character and the story.  The DVD comes very close to capturing the theatre experience.  The extras are great and add a lot to the overall package.  This one is a keeper and sure to be a classic years from now.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is one of the best cds ever made.  Every song on it is good.  Of course everyone likes Buddy Holly, and Undone-The Sweater Song, but there is more to this cd than those two songs.  Weezer knows what is takes to make a good cd. You should also purchase their new cd that came out this year, but that two is pure genius.
1558807381|3.0|At first there was the Void and the dark forces natant within it. Then Light came into being, and the world came from the Light. Demons of the Void, jealous of the Light, tried to destroy the warm, sunny world. Thus, the Light was distilled into Alicorn, the unicorn's horn, so that demons could never destroy it. Demons are scheming creatures, however. Lord Darkness (Tim Curry in heavy makeup) commands his faithful goblin servant Pox to slay the unicorn, so that all light will be extinguished. Pox manipulates innocent Lily (Mia Sara) into luring the unicorn to him, and then shatters its horn. Now it is up to Lily's mysterious lover Jack (a young, nondescript Tom Cruise) and his fairy friends to travel to the demons' citadel and recover the magical Alicorn before the world is overwhelmed by darkness.<br />This ridiculous fairy tale relies so heavily on cliches that when trying to be graceful and simple it only manages to be dull and predictable. The viewer can essentially guess the entire plot before ever watching the film. Light triumphs over darkness, good triumphs over evil, and love conquers all. Jack and Lily, the main characters, are especially terrible: Tom Cruise unsuccessfully shoots for &quot;teen heart-throb&quot; in his revealing armor (hauberk and loincloth), but achieves nothing with his tepid acting; Mia Sara's character (who wears a white, billowing robe all throughout the film to signify her innocence) isn't even cliche - because very few films justify the presence of characters so primitive and trite. Even worse, there is a lot of out-of-place pop-culture humor (like the goblins' battle cry of &quot;Adios, amigos!&quot;).<br />However, &quot;Legend&quot; has a very strong audio-visual presentation. The sets are incredible, the lighting and the camerawork are well-done, the music by Tangerine Dream (who also contributed to &quot;Labyrinth&quot;) is a tasteful accent, and even the dwarf characters look nice (a first in movie history.) That said, thereis a lot of extraneous footage of ugly galloping unicorns, sunny glens, bubbling water and gathering clouds. You get what you pay for, I suppose.<br />A moderately good fantasy phantasmagoria, minus plot and characters.
B00005ATQF|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made.  The first part is my favorite, and Drill Instructer Hartman is super funny.  I think the first part is better, but the second part of the movie is just as good, but the comedy level isn't the same.  All in all this movie is worth owning because you will want to watch it again and again.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Did anyone notice that the technology was better in the earlier days then the later years. I mean if this is a prequel then the technology would be far less advanced, correct? Not much to say on it otherwise. I was completely lost in the plot, nor did I bother to find out what is was about when it was over.
B00005LMBK|5.0|It's just wonderful when all my favorite groups come together. I loved Del from his solo career and different groups (such as Deltron 3030 and Hieroglyphics), I love Blur (a great British Pop band, I love Cibo Matto (another great band with excellent cd's), I love Dan the Automater (from his work on Deltron 3030, Handsome Boy Modeling School, Dr. Octagon, etc.), and I love Kid Koala (his solo albums is insane). In my opinion, what is not to like about this album, it's an excellent mix of styles and it has some really catchy songs. Two words: buy it/
B00000JCB2|1.0|I don't know how these guys still have fans because they could be quiet possibly the worst band I have ever heard.  They bring shame to rap, hip-hop, rock and any other kind of music they sample in to make themselves look good, and Fred Durst is the biggest sissy alive.  Pick this one up if you love TRL, N'Stink or any of that other commercial mindless junk.
1559409010|5.0|Known as the film the Pythons had the most fun making, Life of Brian doesn't disappoint.  There's not much for me to add about this movie that hasn't already been said.  The DVD is fantastic.  The commentaries are wonderful.  It makes me drool in anticipation while I wait for a decent release of the other Python movies.  Why can't they all be Criterion?  It costs more, but in this case, you get what you pay for!
B00005AQE8|5.0|First of all I Would like to say that I am a big 2Pac fan. This is not just a CD for tupac Fans But for all rap lovers, This CD is a classic and has Some of the best songs in history that are still remembered and played today. This CD contains the classic song {California love} It has also a lot of other good songs like- How do you want it, All about you, Life goes on, I Aint Mad atcha, And Picture me rollin. Also this CD contains the California love Video wich is a very nice thing, If you didn't  know this already. To me this is not the best 2 pac album but for some people it is But thats just my opinion. This is a very good CD since it Went 9 times Platinum And the How do you want it Cd single went 2 Times Platimun. This Cd has Party songs, Rough songs and sad songs But all of them with awseome lyrics from The Diceased And Greatest Rapper of all time. R.I.P. 2pac- aka Makaveli
0440219078|4.0|I think &quot;The Giver is a very good book which touches the worries we have - that one day there will perhaps be a planned society by gen manipulation. And it shows that we don't want that but we want to make decisions and be various.
B000002TYK|4.0|You can't understand a damn thing that Grohl is singing, but who cares?<br />Too much reverb on the guitar blunts some of the hooks, but overall, an excellent collection of songs. My favorites are &quot;Alone-Easy Target,&quot; &quot;Floaty,&quot;, and &quot;Big Me.&quot;
B000002I6V|5.0|I bought this album last Christmas because Graham Nash is my favorite CSNY member, and I definitely was NOT disappointed with this effort.  At this point, Simple Man is my favorite song... incredibly heart-breaking. Highly recommended.
B00004Z311|1.0|This is My favorite movie but I've only seen the TV cuts and the VHS... I can't wait till hell freezes over so that I can enjoy it on DVD as well.....
B000002UAR|5.0|Not a bad tune from beginning to end and their best in my opinion as it reflects the last real collaboration among the four and is, in many ways, even a bigger step forward than Sgt Pepper. Musically and lyrically profound there are layers and layers of complexity that make an album that can be listened to repeatedly and that stands the test of time.
0446310786|5.0|The reason I first bought this book is because I was told that I would have to read it in the grade I am about to enter. Figuring that I would just get a head start on the rest of my class b*cuz I have nothing better to do. This book is THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! It deserves more than 5 stars, but thats all they has to offer. I recommended this book for anyone past the age of 13 because I'm not sure if anyone youger than that would be able to understand it as well as older people. If you have the chance to read this book, then I highly recommend it. Please take my advise in consideration when you have nothing better to do on a rainy Sunday. A classic always and forever.
B00000IREA|5.0|This film, along with other stunning classics such as &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,&quot; are sure proof that the age of really, really bad yet good films is behind us.  Set in the 41st Century, the hypersexual Barbarella goes in search of the evil renegade scientist Duran Duran and manages to stumble across what must be the grooviest planet this side of &quot;Vegas in Space.&quot;   In her quest to find Duran Duran (&quot;Pardon me, but do you know Duran Duran?&quot;), Barbarella manages to shag half the planet and pique the prurient interest of the evil, yet uber-sensual bisexual queen (&quot;hello, my pretty, pretty&quot;).  After demolishing the amazing Orgasmatron and getting herself locked into the queen's funky chamber of dreams, Barbarella saves the day with a bubble of goodness and some help from her blind angel friend Pygor.  The unbelievably bad acting in this film is very well counterbalanced by the fabulous Pucciesque fun fur sets and amazing special effects (i.e. Everytime Barbarella has an orgasm her hair instantaneously perms itself!)  It's impossible, given our current climate of cynicism, to produce good quality camp like this today.  All attempts to reproduce a movie this overwhelmingly bad would just have to fail.  Yet, I cannot recommend this film highly enough - run, do not walk, to see it.
B000002MY3|4.0|Good but could have been great.  Too much hype surrounding the wrong songs.
B00005KHEU|4.0|This album is not too bad, considering that there are certain dated sounds on the album.  A great example of this would be one of the disco-ish tunes, most namely &quot;Last Train to London&quot;.  It has the electronic drum effects and the walking bass, and the riffy guitars with the string section playing a la Donna Summer.  But it's still all and all, a very good tune.<br />Don't Bring Me Down is a very energetic rocker that showcases Jeff's flair of writing good oldfashioned rock and roll.  I Need Her Love is a nice ballad with some nice harmonies by the male chorus.  The violins are mainly throughout the album, and they don't totally take away from the actual songs, which is something that ELO is good at doing.  They're probably one of the few (if not the only) rock bands that work well in the symphonic vein.  <br />Another good song is &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp&quot;.  This song kind of reminds me of vintage Queen.  Of course, a lot of songs that ELO has done could support the rumour that Jeff Lynne produced Queen's albums.  But then again, having the same engineer can do that as well.  Very English, very tongue in cheek humour-filled, this song, for me anyway, is one of the biggest highlights of the album.<br />Overall, the album is very well done.  Some great pop songs, with lush strings, great rhythm section, and lovely vocal work by Lynne, it's definitely one of their great albums.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Reinventing its music more often than Madonna renews her wardrobe, Radiohead has gotten bored of its earlier guitar based style. Amnesiac, Radiohead's latest creation, instead substitutes synthesized electronica instruments.  The ambient tunes are rarely catchy and, true to the title, can be hard to remember. For example, &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; sounds like a song played backwards, mixed freely with subliminal messages and church choir vocals. The title not only describes the music's sound, but also shows the group's nihilism.  Even though lead singer Thom Yorke's voice is distorted and incoherent, the track has a subversive point. It may be suggesting that the world is like spinning plates about to crash down. Complex songs like this challenge the listener to press repeat. In fact, the most striking aspect of Amnesiac is how the music improves with every listening.  The album's blips and whirring noises are more likely made by a space ship than a human being.  &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; may have an interesting and quirky name, but the constant lyrics describing various doors with a base background gets monotonous. It is too irritating for an earthling with normal range frequency hearing to appreciate.    However, not all of the album is quite so hard on the ears. &quot;Knives Out&quot; and &quot;Life in a Glass House&quot; are both lyrical and radio-friendly. &quot;Life in a Glass House&quot; is one of the most melodic and fascinating songs on the album.  Yorke's voice sounds eerily out of place in this futuristic take on 1930's New Orleans funeral music.  The song features the jamming skills of veteran jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttleton and other clarinet players. The album as a whole is more suited for periods of deep thought than dance parties at the Roxy. The songs are imaginative and seem to come straight from a child's nightmare.  While I question whether Amnesiac was recorded on this planet, it is undeniably a breath of fresh cyanide.
B00005214X|5.0|Right after the Beatles broke up, George went ahead and did the unthinkable.  He put out an album that made him the first of the solo Beatles to become a superstar.  And he did it in his first shot.  <br />Many Beatle fans state that this album is perhaps the best solo Beatle album ever made, next to John Lennon's debut album.  And I would agree with them.  The songwriting and the performances are bigger than life, and they leave you breathless after each listen.  <br />Phil Spector's production is very obvious throughout the album.  He also shows how sensitive he is to ballads, while letting the bigger numbers explode with drama and climatic landscapes as he only can with his \\"wall of sound\\".  Although, I would agree with George's hesitation to want to \\"remix\\" the entire album, it would be interesting to hear how it would sound without all the reverb.<br />The bonus tracks are pretty decent on the album.  \\"I Live For You\\" is a great song that I think would have worked on the album back in its original release.  But then again, this remix of the song (and recent touchups), is the version that George intended to put out.  And I'm glad he did.  It would have been a nice little song that the world wouldn't have known about...until now.  The demos of the other songs are nice, especially to see where the creative process comes from as far as the arrangements.  And the new version of My Sweet Lord (2000), while not eclipsing the intensity of the original, does showcase more of his magical slide guitar.  Although his voice may be frail at points, and it sounds like he's singing his heart out even more when he gets to the high bits (unfortunate, due to his bours with cancer and the stabbing), it gives the performance much more passion and emotion that his vocal didn't really have on the original.<br />Of course, who could forget the instrumental jams.  Some people may want to, others don't care one way or the other.  But the jams are just there basically to showcase how much fun the guys had together in the studio...as if the normal album wasn't enough evidence.<br />Overall, it's a wonderful tour-de-force that really showcases the great songwriting of the Quiet Beatle.  If anything, it kind of makes you wonder...Why didn't they let more of his songs on those Beatle albums, anyway?
B000002KB8|5.0|This album opened a whole new world for music: the world of heavy metal. Long Live BLACK SABBATH ( with Ozzy, of course, because after that, ugh..!)
B000001ESJ|5.0|Following up on the success of their breakthough release 2112, Rush made A Farewell to Kings, which is in short one of the best prog rock albums ever. Although I slightly prefer 2112 over AFTK for sentimental reasons, the latter is much better musically, IMO.<br />It all starts off with the title track, a socially concious song that, every time I listen to it, makes me imagine that I'm back in the middle ages. The second track is a masterpiece within a masterpiece: Xanadu. Eclipsing 11 minutes, it is an excellent song that I can listen to again and again. Closer to the Heart follows, and could be described as the band's signature song. Played at virtually every live show, every Rush fan knows it's lyrics by heart. Following CTTH is Cinderella Man, which was penned by Geddy Lee, and is very enjoyable. Madrigal is a short but sweet, and very beautiful, track. Closing out the set is the album's second masterpiece: Cygnus X-1. With perhaps the most chilling introduction of all their tracks, Rush spins into a fury of music and screaming vocals that will give you goosebumps.<br />All of these tracks combined equal a great album and one of Rush's finest accomplishments.
B000000W5F|2.0|THE ROLLING STONES ARE CLEARLY THE MOST OVERRATED BAND OF ALL TIMES. Only that can explain that an album with the ridiculous &quot;HANG FIRE&quot; be considered a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Anyway, among the various low-class releases they put ou in the eighties, this TATTOO YOU is really something good.
B00005KJ1G|4.0|Finally! It's here on CD, and there isn't a let-down at all. The songs on this album have always been great, (esp. faves:Metal Daze, Fast Taker, Dark Avenger) but now they're even better on this remastered version. The booklet is probably the best thing about it; lots of pictures and quips from the band. The only thing that I find lacking is the production, especially for it being remastered. Yes, I know this was originally done a long time ago, but when I buy something remastered, I expect top quality. Still, it's a must-have for any self-respecting Manowar fan. You gotta love these guys!
0767851900|4.0|This is definitely a great movie - it's frickin' hilarious! Better than that, though, is that it has a good message. &quot;Wait,&quot; I hear you say, &quot;isn't this the movie which had the Catholic church (as well as quite a few other Christian organizations) up in arms and worried about the corruption of the youth of America?&quot; Well, yes. But it's obvious from the complaints lodged against it that it wasn't viewed with the proper perspective. If anyone were to look deeper, one would see that this movie actually promotes a more profound faith. It criticizes blind following and advocates questioning, which is crucial to developing true faith. (I don't care what your religious affiliation is - if you haven't thought about it or questioned it or answered for it or admitted to yourself that you're not going to have ALL the answers, you haven't made it YOUR religion and perhaps your faith is a little shallow.) On the other hand, if you're not religious at all, you'll enjoy the movie for its excellent plot and absolutely hilarious dialogue, not to mention the return of Jay and Silent Bob, who figure greatly into the film. In any case, this IS just a movie, and anyone who thinks it'll change anyone's beliefs is a bit paranoid. Give the movie-goers some credit, ok? (If it DOES change anyone's views on religion drastically, I don't think you can blame &quot;Dogma&quot; or Kevin Smith. It has more to do with the person's apparently tenuous grasp on reality. It's just a movie!) <br />To the point: I'd recommend this to basically anyone with a sense of humour (preferably a twisted one, although it's not necesary), and/or an interesting perspective on life. Watch it even if you haven't seen the rest of the Jersey trilogy. (Though I recommend that as well - check out &quot;Clerks,&quot; &quot;Mallrats,&quot; and &quot;Chasing Amy.&quot; Then try to wait patiently for &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.&quot;) Essentially, the only people who SHOULDN'T see this movie arethose who lack a sense of humour. Or Puritans.
078401213X|4.0|If you ignore the presentation, Pi is actually a neat little thriller. It's easy to over-analyse it (as some have done here), but it essentially boils down to a glorified 'Twilight Zone' episode - one of the good ones. There's a groovy soundtrack featuring some Warp-esque techno acts, lots of quotable lines, and although the central story is basically Arthur C. Clarke's 'The Nine Billion Names of God', it's sufficiently intriguing to keep you watching for an hour and a half. It's not really high art, as such, but it's extremely well-made and very watchable. The DVD is good, too, with lots of extra bits, and it's cheap.
0345440757|3.0|Purchased this book to try to get my non-sleeping, no schedule 6 month old to sleep and get on track.  Basically this book tells you how to do this from the day you come home from the hospital and falls short on advice for people who were a little late to realize they were screwing it up.  Anyway, at 14 months my son still is not on a schedule, but we are getting better everyday on our own without a book.  I recommend this book for the new mom, and she should read it BEFORE the birth.  Other than that it's handy for some quick reference.
B000000I0Q|5.0|&quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot;, the first solo offering from a Genesis member, showcases Steve Hackett's unique and immense talents on the guitar quite nicely. The opening track &quot;Ace of Wands&quot;, starts things off in grand progressive fashion, although &quot;Ace&quot; is somewhat reminiscent of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, with its' encapsulated keyboard rhythms. The pastoral tracks &quot;Hands of the Priestess Parts I &amp; II&quot; have both a mythological and mysterious quality to them, with &quot;&quot;HOTPPI&quot; displaying more of the above qualities. &quot;A Tower Struck Down&quot; displays a unique, artsy progressive charm, in that it features an intricate, fuzzy guitar inerlude in the middle, complete with unanimous bits of chanting in the second half of &quot;Tower&quot;. &quot;The Hermit&quot; is very silent, and features Hackett's weak, somewhat cathartic vocals, but it's a nice piece of instrumentation, nonetheless. Phil Collins, Steve's Genesis bandmate at the time, provides guest vocals on &quot;Star of Sirius&quot;, as well as percussive and drumming duties on all the tracks here. Collins' and Hackett's intertwined vocals, particularly on the first half of 'Sirius&quot;, sound somewhat muddled, but work well with the fluent progressive vibes displayed here. The brief instrumental &quot;The Lovers&quot; is the calm before the storm of &quot;Shadow of the Hierophant&quot;, a wonderfully composed semi-progressive track, which features a lovely choir-like vocal, provided by Mike Oldfield's wife Sally. Of all the Genesis related solo projects, &quot;VOTA&quot; has to be in the top five, up there with such gems as Tony Banks' &quot;A Curious Feeling&quot; and Mike Rutherford's (who also contributed musically to &quot;Voyage&quot;) &quot;Smallcreep's Day&quot;. &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot; is truly a Steve Hackett masterpiece, and should not be overlooked by any Genesis fan, or any fan of Progressive Rock, for that matter. Since &quot;Voyage&quot; is the very first solo Genesis CD, it would be wise to add this one to your collection. The gorgeous, stunning artwork on the cover, provided by Steve's wife Kim Poor, is yet another reason not to pass this one by.&quot; is the very first solo Genesis CD, it would be wise to add this one to your collection.

B0000508U6|4.0|Like many US listeners, I was first alerted to this band through the minimalist video for the song \\"Yellow\\"; in an era when dazzling computer-generated special effects are used to sell [cruddy], generic songs, here was a guy walking along a beach in a video that must've cost [price] to make.  And both it and the song outclassed everything else on MTV and VH1 at the time.  I bought the album several months back and found it a strong, largely enjoyable collection of sensitive Britpop with one of the strongest vocalists to come out of  the rock scene in *years*; comparisons to Travis and Radiohead were natural but it was clear that this band had their own sound.  Not quite as experimental as Radiohead's recent work, not as mannered as Blur or Travis, this music sounded as honest and pure as it gets (actually, I spotted a bit of The Velvet Underground in \\"Yellow\\").  Coldplay make it sound easy, when these days it is not: an album like this would've probably been taken for granted in the glory years of the 60s and 70s, but in today's arid--screw arid, how about scorched--musical climate, where imagination has been completely superceded by drum machine patterns, \\"Parachutes\\" sounds like a minor miracle.  The next album is purported to be similar in sound; this does not leave a lot of room for expansiveness but it is always nice to see an \\"alternative\\" group hit the mainstream and then bring the mainstream closer to a more natural, inspired fount.
B00005A0N5|5.0|As a lover of heavy rock for more than 15 years it is not often I hear something I can call truly different. This is one of those rare moments. Great composition, amazing, phenomenal and unique semi-operatic vocals and wonderful use of mood change. If you must create a pigeon hole - Stratovarius and Blind Guardian meet Andrew Lloyd Weber on steroids. Make no mistake, this is metal Jim, but not as we know it. PS - I also have Wishmaster and it too is fantastic.
0451160916|5.0|This is the best book ever. Kings analogies with Jacks father and the hotel is excellent. The way he describes the downfall of Jack, Danny and Wendy is superb.  Everybody knows what the shining is about, and most everybody has seen the movie. But the book is awesome!! His detail is great and so is his imagination. READ THIS BOOK. I read it when I was 13.
B0000399WI|5.0|Had &quot;The Shawshank Redemption' received any type of marketing push upon it's theatrical release it surely would have been one of the huge hits of the previous decade. As it stands however the movie, through the home video market, has found an ever expanding audience that appreciates it's stunning power and beauty. People now use the word 'classic' when referring to &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;. This is not an overstatement. Great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and storytelling add up to an all-time great movie. Enjoy!

B000003BDJ|5.0|This is the best collection of the Stones early hits. Songs like 'Sympathy for the Devil' and 'Ruby Tuesday' are just a few that show the range of ability and creativeness of this band. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are some of the best song writers of our era and I can only hope to see them on tour again. They are excelent on stage and in the studio. Their roots in blues music give them that edge to pull off the dynamic lyrics and sounds. If you want to find out were this band comes from this is a great place to start.
B0000025CP|4.0|This album, released in 1978, begins the classic period of Priest. It is also my third favorite album from said group. You just have to love the Ritchie Blackmore-esque guitar sound on this album. Favorites include the opening ode to speed &quot;Exciter&quot;, the rockin' &quot;White Heat, Red Hot&quot;, the melancholy &quot;Beyond The Realms Of Death&quot;, and the closing song &quot;Heroes End&quot;(The best on this album in my opinion, has a great melancholy riff). This was a groundbreaking effort, but the best was only yet to come
B00003CX5P|3.0|Ever wonder why you can watch the first Star Wars trilogy over and over again and still feel the Force? Despite the lack of special effects that we now come to expect these days, you seriously can't tell they were filmed in the late 70s early 80s. And you never feel like you are watching an &quot;old&quot; movie. The trilogy has the same magic as Stanley Kubrick's &quot;2001 - A Space Odyssey&quot; in that it remains timeless and it hasn't been saturated by Hollywood culture.<br />The coming of episode one brought with it a sense of the 90s that will probably make you uneasy the first time you watch it, especially since most of the creatures were 3D animated. I nolonger felt like I was meeting new civilizations as most everyone spoke English. And the use of Jar-Jar for comic relief made me cringe. I found it very hard to take a liking to any of the characters at the beginning, especially as they were put into danger soon after the opening title. I honestly didn't care if they made it to the next scene.<br />All-in-all it's a good movie and will keep you interested. The whole film is completely bright and colorful, which makes it a perfect candidate as a good DVD. The more times you watch it, the more desensitized you'll become to it's underlying tone and you'll enjoy it a lot more as a whole. You might even believe that young Anakin is really a good child actor and isn't just repeating script. I am just wondering how they can make a smooth transition from this, to &quot;A New Hope.&quot;

0792838068|5.0|Jazz man Mike Figgis' grim drama documents a romantic triangle of sorts involving prostitute Sera (Elisabeth Shue), failed Hollywood screenwriter Ben (Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage), and the constant flow of booze which he loves more dearly than life itself. Arriving in Las Vegas with the intention of drinking himself to death, Ben meets Sera, and they gradually begin falling for one another. From the outset, however, Ben warns Sera that no matter what, she can never ask him to quit drinking, a condition to which she grudgingly agrees. A darkly comic tragedy, Leaving Las Vegas charts the brief romantic convergence of two desperately needy people who together find a brief flicker of happiness
B0000027F3|5.0|God damn it, this is the best effin' Priest album ever made. It's hard, it's heavy, but still delivered with the same class that classic Priest has to offer. This is also one of the few times when a metal band updates their sound and IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD. <br />1. Painkiller - Tasty 6 minute opening number, the drumming at the beginning is very rockin' and despite the positive subject matter, this song is heavier than hell 2. Hell Patrol - Nice drum part at the beginning, this is also a very desireable number, although it is mid-paced 3. All Guns Blazing - Kinda cheesy, but that does not deter the rest of the album 4. Leather Rebel - Short and sweet, this is an anthem for all bikers 5. Metal Meltdown - Now, THIS is some crazy stuff. Thrashin' tempos with frenetic solos; if you are not getting in on the action, you probably have died 6. Nightcrawler - Sinister stuff with Slayer-esque lyrical content. Notables include the solo, which imps the verse vocal melody and the spoken word part. When Halford snarls &quot;Souls ascend to heaven, while they feast on flesh and blood&quot; it sends shivers down your spine 7. Between The Hammer And The Anvil - Another great song, an anthemic number with a big chorus and a tasty intro/outro 8. Touch Of Evil - Transylvanian style synths and twisted love lyrics are a nice change of pace. 9. Battle Hymn - A great instrumental, serves well as an intro to the next track 10. One Shot At Glory - 6 minutes and 47 seconds are enough to take you through a long battle that was won, and when on the outro, you hear Rob scream &quot;I still hear the battle cry, I still see the banners fly&quot;, it leaves the listener desiring MORE.
B00004Z459|3.0|Like what the world really needs is another rap-rock group with a front man whining about everything from girls to people stepping on his toes. However, Linkin Park do provide a refreshing relief from the idiot wails of Fred Durst and the over-sappiness that Jonathon Davis seems to be leaning toward. The music is really not much different from anything that Bizkit does, but the difference is in the vocals. The double threat that fronts Linkin Park compliment each other very well, and the lyrics are on much higher level than Durst (which basically means that the f-word does appear fifty-thousand times in one song). But despite catchy tunes like &quot;Papercut,&quot; &quot;One Step Closer,&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot; Linkin Park really doesn't break any new ground with Hybrid Theory. But hey, it's better than listening to an idiot yell about being able to say the f-word.
B00000BKDW|5.0|This is the album that will intrigue you, and forever make you say METAL RULES! Nothing, and I mean, nothing, could top this sometimes progressive, sometimes speedy, sometimes atmospheric masterpiece. We have the opener \\"Aces High\\", a song that would give speed metal a run for it's money, then we have the dark and dramatic \\"Two Minutes To Midnight\\", then we have the great abstract instrumental \\"Losfer Words\\". The riff at the beginning of \\"Flash Of The Blade\\" just gives me chills in my spine. We finish off with the title track, an ode to ancient Egypt(and they do it well, the instrumentalism here would make you think you are riding a camel through the desert), and then the ULTIMATE METAL MASTERPIECE, \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\". It is progressive, emotion, and at the same time, is still a hard rocking song. You do not know the full capabilities of metal until you have heard this album straight through.

B000002HMH|3.0|...Much of Load is tiring and some of it is disastrous, which seems unforgivable for one of the greatest bands that ever lived. All of that aside, I'm happy I own it because Until It Sleeps and King Nothing are two of the most powerful songs ever recorded. I'll gladly click by the rest of the drivel to pummel my brain into sonic ecstasy with those.
B00003CXE7|3.0|I can't understand how this movie beat out Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon for best picture? Just goes to show how scandalous and racist the Oscar committee are. This movie will insult your intelligence! If you remember studying western civilization, the movie greatly overexaggerates the actual fighting methods devised by the Romans, Romans fought in legions not in cascading style; and greatly overexaggerates the actual fighting that took place in the colosseum, nobody really got killed-this is a myth propogated by Hollywood. How about how he took 2 horses to race home against the Preatorians who were going to kill his family? Wouldn't both horses get tired? A lot of scenes where cut out which would have explained some lines in the movie better...maybe you can find them. I found a bunch of &quot;why did he say that&quot; type lines through the whole movie, like why Crowe was called &quot;the Spaniard&quot;? The movie never mentioned that he lived in Spain. Too many incomplete things in this movie. Something telling of the weakness of the director. This is another one of those movies who took on a span too much than could be made into a movie. Russell Crowe didn't have a long enough monologue in the entire movie worthy of the praise gratuitiously bestowed upon him by critics. No Gordon Gekko performance here. Crowe had some of the easiest lines in the whole movie. Phoenix on the other hand had some great lines. The fight scenes where thrown together in disarray, scenes which should have been the staple of the movie, stood empty and disappointing. Just because a movie takes on a huge cinematic scale like a Ben Hur doesn't make it great. This movie was very disappointing. Joaquin gave the best performance. Crowe gave a mediocre performance. This movie is not in the same class of some of the greatest like Goodfellas, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Saving Private Ryan. This is a one time watcher. I could watch Goodfellas, Crouching Tiger and Scarface over and over again. This will stay on my shelf for a while.
B000021Y77|4.0|An entertaining, high-energy film in which characters crash off each other like balls in a pinball game, spinning each other's lives into new trajectories.  This film tackles some serious issues but refuses to take itself seriously, thereby remaining light and entertaining at all times.  To what extent are our lives ruled by chance, and to what extent are our fates determined by personality?  Watching the different versions of Lola's run through town, we can see that the lives of various secondary characters take dramatically different turns depending on such apparently innocuous details as whether Lola runs by at a certain point in time or five seconds later.  Yet the fate of Lola and her boyfriend, Manni, always seem to be the same.  This is a rewarding film whether you or in the mood to ponder such issues or just to be entertained.
B00005BCNC|4.0|This movie is a tour de force for Tom Hanks and has some very compelling moments.  In the beginning of the movie, he is shown as a FedEx employee who is obsessed with time schedules and spends copious amounts of time on his cell-phone and answering his beeper.  He is a slave to his job as evidenced by a Christmas Day departure for a business trip which forces him and his fiance, played by Helen Hunt, to open their gifts in the car before he leaves.  Helen Hunt is sadly underutilized in this part, by the way.  By far the best scenes in the movie occur during the circumstances which strand him on an uninhabited island and the time in which he lives on the island.  Needless to say, his priorities change drastically and he is kept going by a fading picture of his girlfriend and by accomplishments such as discovering water and creating fire.  The scenes before and after this segment are poorly written and unconvincing and if anyone but Tom Hanks was saying some of these lines, we'd never believe them.  The island scenes were well-done, but I was left with a vaguely unsatisfied feeling at the end.
B000000H5J|5.0|This CD totally rocks!!!  I bought Obsolete and Digimortal and this CD is better than both!  My favorite songs are New Breed, Demanufacture, and Self Bias Resistor.

B00003XACV|5.0|American Beauty is one of my favorite movies, due mostly to it's fantastic score by Thomas Newman. It is simple and beautiful music that you don't need to have seen the movie to appriciate. It varies from sweetly melancholy (Weirdest Home Videos, Mr. Smarty Man, Amrican Beauty, Angela Undress), to strong and dark (Power of Denial, Root Beer, Spartanette, Marine), to lightly upbeat (Dead Already, Lunch W/ the King, Still Dead), and everywhere in between. It is good music to read, relax, and think to. Alll in all, it's worth every single penny.
B000003TAW|5.0|The debut album from geek-rock group Weezer is one-of-a-kind. It has something on it that is so unique, so special, so original. But, whatever it is, exactly, can't be pinpointed. When Weezer came onto the music scene in 1994, their alt. rock/punk/pop sound created a wave of followers that would be loyal through all their musical changes. The first of their albums, the self-titled epic also known as the Blue Album, is a revelation and has this certain something that can't be found on most records. But, what it is isn't known. You can just feel that it's there. The sound is completely new and original, and that causes the record to stand out. With tracks like &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; and &quot;In The Garage,&quot; it provides a deep, threatening guitar sound that roars above the rest of the instruments. Of course, there are the classic tracks such as &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; and &quot;Undone - The Sweater Song.&quot; (Hopefully, a soon-to-be kareoke favorite.) The two most notable tracks on here are those two singles, which have a flare and poppy flavor all of their own. It's such a treat to have a group like Weezer around because they have a style that many bands can't carry off. Geekiness. The debut is a must-have that, even after many listens, won't make you tired of Weezer. If you keep this on your shelf for a while and then pick it up, it'll put a smile on your face because you'll hear it and remember the good old days. Weezer is kind of like cookies that grandma makes. That familiar aroma drives your senses crazy and makes you gitty like a little schoolgirl. Even though the album is only 10 tracks (the last being 8 minutes long, and the worst of them all), the album is still an amazing piece of work, sure to be noted for it's genius years from now. Weezer will always be known as &quot;Buddy Holly,&quot; but actually they are more than that. Remember, the geeks are the smartest of us all.
B000000OSW|5.0|It has taken me awhile to appreciate this album as a whole, but it has been well worth the wait... this album is one my favorite albums, and everytime I listen to it it speaks to my soul... Peter Gabriel is a musical genious, always exploring new territory in his music, and always infusing his music with influences of the world, and he has a talent for writing a heart wrenching melody, but his true gift his his voice... The voice is the part of the music that speaks to the listener, and Peter Gabriels speaks directly to the soul... it is in my opinion the best voice in rock music today, and has made sure that I will always be a fan of his music... That being said, this album is good because each song is a masterpiece, not just because it's a Peter Gabriel album... The songs talk about something that we all can relate to, relationships... everytime I listen to it, it's like looking through a photo album, the memories just come flooding back... and that's a good thing... stand out tracks are Come Talk to Me, Digging in the Dirt, and Secret World (possibly the best song ever writen, in my opinion of course)... if you don't already own this one, you definately need to pick it up...
B000002J09|5.0|This album rocks! From the opening whine of &quot;hey hey mama&quot;and the goofy guitar riff we go to Rock and Roll which is pure cheesy rock sendup at it's finest. Battle Of Evermore has some very amusing vocal diharmonies, producing a truly cringeworthy but enjoyable experinece. Stairway is a dud, being merely boring.Misty Moutain Hop sounds like high school band trying their hand at writing a catchy pop tune, but unable to figure out concepts like &quot;melody&quot; &quot;harmony&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot;. Still, kudos for trying guys! Four Sticks is pure comic awfulness. Going To California is hilariously unctuous -nice one Robert!. And finally When The Levee Breaks, which I don't include because it isn't their song.<br />All in all ,a must buy! Guarantee to bring a smile to your face.
0380725398|4.0|Even if it is not as good as Rebecca, My Cousin Rachel, or The Scapegoat (but better than the House on the Strand), it is still a page turner, vivid and descriptive and, in the best DuMaurier tradition, very very dark.  That said, my rating would actually be closer to 3 1/2 stars.<br />Mary Yellan is an appealingly scrappy heroine, if somewhat prone to foolhardy actions.  I liked that she had guts and that she could be honest about her feelings about a man she had no business loving.  Another plus for this book: I bought her falling in love with the roguish horse thief Jem Merlyn.  I myself found him sexy (wish there had been more of him in the book).  Their chemistry was a nice reflection of the less benign pairing of Mary's poor Aunt Patience and the brutish Joss Merlyn. Perhaps my favorite line because it spoke volumes in few words is &quot;Now Mary understood why she hated her uncle.&quot;  Or something to that effect. <br />DuMaurier goes a little overboard in the description of the moor and the tors, although I admit it is necessary to establish the setting.  A big reason I do love DuMaurier books is the strong sense of place and time.  I suppose that this particular setting was not as interesting as - say - the estate in Rebecca.  I knew so because my eye would dart down the page and the next for quotation marks in the hopes that a conversation would break up the lengthy descriptions.<br />In short one could do a lot worse than this book in the general realm of fiction but as far as DuMaurier fiction is concerned, one could do somewhat better.
B00005B36H|3.0|I like this album because it combines UNDERTOW and AENEMA to a degree but then it expands on that idea.  Some of the dynamics seem odd even for Tool.  I really dug Opiate when i was 13, got Undertow and fell in love with that and Aenema, well that album is their masterpiece.  But I feel somewhat let down by this CD, I expected more from the premier band in rock n roll.  Contrary to what the band themselves will tell you, it seems they've almost rested on their laurels and just decided to throw together some songs that they had sitting around.  Anyone else get this feeling? now dont get me wrong I love Tool and all their previous works made me see them live 5 times in my lifetime but I get the feeling that this album is missing something....
B00003CXAA|5.0|When I was a a kid..I keep hearing about The GodFather, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino from my Uncle and I didn't know what the hell he was talking about. In fact I saw parts of The GodFather II and III when I was 10 or 11. I was naive and stupid at that time ofcourse, So I thought it was boring and I didn't understood the movie....10 years later (present day), I was in a mall and saw a VHS tape of The GodFather I. I said to my self &quot;well yeah ok...I think I'll buy this tape and see what this movie is all about...&quot;...then something happened.....the very first scene of The GodFather with Marlon Brando...BOOOOOOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!! I've heard of Marlon Brando's performance and how he revolutionized acting during the 50's...i've seen both Street Car and Waterfront and i thought he was terrific....but never...I mean never have i've ever seen Acting like that.....minimalist and simplistic...YET so powerful and mesmerising!!!! I WAS shocked!!! my Jaw dropped and I couldn't keep my eyes off of the TV. I keep saying to my self...&quot; Ohhhh......myy........god......&quot; repeating that almost 100 times through out the entire movie..BUT THAT WASNT ALL!!!! The story, unforgettable scenes and Brando's performance was enough to make this the best movie of all time...But that wasn't enough....There's AL 'Freakin' Pacino!!!!! OH MY GOD.....I've never seen him so young...so innocent..so adorable...I've seen some of his movies he made in the 80's and 90's...like Scarface...Sea of love...Scent of a Woman...Dick Tracy..City Hall..Devils Advocate...Heat. etc. and Ii thought he was brilliant. BUT this!!! Oh my god....He was perfect for the Role of Michael Corleone.  I couldn't imagine anyone....Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman or Jack Nicholson playing Michael Corleone...The transformation of Al from Michael the Adorable, Innocent War hero to Michael the ruthless, manipulative Don was one of the most dominant part of of the movie and later on continued inGodFather II. Michael slowly becoming the ruthless and merciless DON, the decay of everything around him......Every scene was UNFORGETTABLE!!! Coupled with a beautiful and chilling Soundtrack....MY GOD...what can I say....I listen to them almost everynight..I AM THE ULTIMATE FAN!!! I TELL YOU! I think i've seen the movies 1000 times..literally..all three of them. And still.... I can't get enough of them!! AND THE CAST!! OH MY GOD!! James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Lee Strasberg, Mike V. Gazzo...their performance was unforgattable!!  And GodFather II....MY GOD....The story and scences were really fantastic...Robert De Niro was great....BUT AL PACINO was PHENOMENAL!!!! this was HIS movie..His acting...his moves...his blunt facial expressions..his presence was breath taking. ABSOLUTELY! THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME! THE MOVIE(S) ARE PERFECT!! I've seen Citizen Kane, Casablanca and Gone With The Wind...they're great movies...but they dont even come close...Maybe because im a man....and as a man....obsession with power...the POWER that corrupts....is every mans ultimate fantasy...
B00004RFFM|5.0|A team of reasearchers aboard the floating laboratory &quot;Aquatica&quot; have been playing God. By re-engineering the DNA of mako sharks they have created the perfect killing machine.<br />Now a tropical storm approaches these creations have only one thing on there minds - ultimate terror (and perhaps a meal or two). When the Laboratory begins to flood the team ( Samuel Jackson, Thomas Jane, LL CoolJ, Saffron Burrows etc) become trapped below deck.  Time is running out and they mustfight to destroy their creations. This is the part of the movie where you should get a strange sense of deja vu - ever heard of Jaws ???<br /> It's a heart-pumping, palm-sweating, piece of Saturday night movie watching. Watch it at your peril !!!
B000003EPN|5.0|This is an electifying set of Rigoletto. Robert Merrill is a splendid Rigoletto - he conveys the jester's bitterness and heartbreak superbly through his rich dark voice and incisive phrasing - his Cortigiani is spine-tingling and the final scene with his dying daughter is quite hearth-wrenching. Anna Moffo is a lovely and touching Gilda - she brings considerable warmth and tenderness to the role and sings an exquisite Caro nome. Alfredo Kraus is quite simply the best Duke on record -  charming and callous all at once - he is in fresh voice and sing with superb aplomb and exciting high notes. Rosalind Elias and Ezio Flagello round up the cast admirably. Sir Georg Solti is a bit hard-driven but the end result is undeniably exciting. The text is complete and the sound a bit dryish but quite good on the whole. This was my first Rigoletto and remains my favorite.

0385334206|2.0|Though I typically find KV's books very entertaining, this one just didn't do much for me for the first 9/10 of it. Vonnegut usually has some phrase or idea he repeats extensively in his novels; you may remember \\"ting-a-ling\\" or \\"So it goes\\"; well, in this novel, which is excessively badly pornographic in passing, Vonnegut feels the need to tell you the size of every male character's member upon introduction; It really doesn't serve any central purpose to the story. <BR>Two of the key characters, Rabo and Kilgore, are served up much more fascinatingly and entertainingly in other books. He also includes a TON of drawings, which are only necessary maybe one fifth of the time. I guess I believe he has a problem with moderation!
B000025558|1.0|I think Thom made Kid A and Amnesiac to make fools of the reviewers, critics, and bandwagon jumping fans. Kind of like spitting in their face knowing they have to keep a smile! I don't like the music, but if this is his intent I applaud him, for it shows his genius. Just in a different way.
0930289528|5.0|I expected a lot of this Graphic Novel, but it was even better. This one really blew me of my socks.  What we get to see is an alternative timeline in which Germany actually won World War II and where England has turned into a fascist state.  People live very cautious and affraid because everything they say or do is being monitored, and they've been overly restricted by their own government. Then oneday a mystic figure appears and he rocks the city. He murders people of importance, he blows up government buildings, and nobody knows a single thing of who he is or why he does the things he does, except that he's codenamed himself V.  Meanwhile V takes a little girl under his wing who he teaches things about his history, about herself and about what is happening. But over time the government is getting closer too.  Along the story more and more is explained about who V is, about what moves V, about the real consequences the war has cost and about the value of a free will. All this is illustrated very appropriatly by David Lloyd in a bit of a cinematic style. This makes the flow of the story even better. For me personally this is the best Alan Moore Graphic Novel I've read so far and I would easily recommend it to everyone who is looking for something more than superheroes. Even when you're normally not that much into comicbooks this could very possibly still be one heck of a ride for you ...
B00005B4GU|1.0|Thom Yorke has the best voice and the best writing ability of any one in music today and he wastes it all on this album.  There is no magic on this album as there was on OK Computer or even the Bends.  There is a little more redeeming value than Kid A, I must admit, but I just can't figure out what the (heck) Yorke is doing.  He's going out of his way not to write a catchy song and just drones and whines incessantly with a little computer music thrown in.  I think he's just totally burnt out and can't come up with good material.  All the critics who have liked the last two albums probably feel bad for missing the genius of the Bends and OK Computer and are compensating by lavishing praise on this drivel.  Oh well.  I'll keep waiting for some more genius to come from Yorke because the guy has proven he can hit home runs! On this cd he's left his bat at home and just stands there (...) on home plate.  Try the Radiohead clones Coldplay and Grandaddy if you can't handle Amnesiac and want some of the old Radiohead style.
B00004XONN|5.0|It's my favorite from them. I liked &quot;Creep&quot; a lot when I heard it. I wasn't a big fan of their other stuff, but one day when I was stuck at a Hastings store, I listened to the whole album when I was able to. I loved it. So I had to buy it. &quot;Optimistic&quot; isn't even the best at all, but is by far more radio-friendly than the stuff on Kid A. The title track has a lot of disstortion. After awhile, this doesn't get bad at all. &quot;Everything's In its Right Place&quot; is a great first track. Shows how Kid A is gonna be. If you love music a lot, I recommend this to you. Sure it's not what 82920742 bands are coming out with. It's not for everyone who liked or disliked OKC, because everyone's different. I just thought it was funny how everyone I know doesn't even like it and all say it was overhyped. What type of hype is that? No hype to me. This album is better than the hype anyways. This is a very important album. I suggest you buy it. Thom Yorke is a genious.
0679879269|5.0|I have read the full &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy, and found each one intelectually and emotionally thrilling. However I believe this one to be the best. The plot was amazingly thought and written out, and I would never have guessed the ending. It was great fun watching (or reading) as Will and Lyra (our hero and heroine) grew older and matured, and their relationship grew to something more serious, and ended in a way I would never have guessed, which only helped to make the book better. Also, to any one who has read the book, and didn't understand how Dr. Mary Mallone tempted  Lyra, (if you haven't read the book I suggest not reading this part) think about when she was sitting with Will and Lyra and telling them about her &quot;first love&quot;, and how Lyra and a certain some one were &quot;tempted&quot; to stay together but...well, you know the rest. To anyone who likes fantasy (and even anyone who doesn't) I recommend this book...with five stars.

B000000WFU|1.0|I recently heard this Cd at one of friends house. And that was one of my worst listining experiance ever. This Cd is so boring and bland that you cant bear it for long. No music nothing only some horrible sounds. they try to do some thing tribal or world music, but all they come up with a crap, the sound is very very english. overall its a big waste f time and money
0060254920|5.0|Don't let that scare you. Another... One of the best, from ABSOLUTELY the best. I loved this book as a kid, and fear not, they're not to wild. So, c'mon mom, if you love your kids
067144901X|5.0|I bought this book for my 8 month old daughter and she cannot get enough of it!  When I tell her &quot;Moo, Baa, La La La&quot;, she quickly crawls to it and brings it to me.  She especially likes the singing pigs part.  The only problem is, is that when I finish reading the book, she gets quite upset, and I end up reading it at least 5 times at each sitting!  I would highly recommend this book.
B000001Y5J|4.0|I doubt that anyone will be disapointed when purchasing &quot;Broken&quot;, because they already know what they're getting into. It's for any fans of heavy industrial music.<br />The only song on this CD that doesn't have a video for it (with the exception of the hidden tracks) is &quot;Last&quot;. That is also the song you should download if you'd like to download a song without the fear of ruining any surprises. If you like that song, you'll love the rest.
B00003CXFG|2.0|And that was about it.  The first hour was filled with talking about the research team that landed on the planet.  When the aliens attacked, they did things that any idiot would never do and they just died.  The only character that I actually liked was the one who had the weird eyes (the killer).  The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light.  Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead.  The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it.  The rest was stupid.  My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever.
0060934913|5.0|If I wasn't good friends with the pastry chef at Le Cirque, I never would have believed a word of it.  As it is, I think it a wonderful book that is entertaining, and NOT some food expose'.  If you want to know how a New York kitchen works, read it.
B00005B36H|4.0|Until now, progressive hard rock died a slow death in the past ten years. Born out of the Rush of the late Seventies and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal in the early Eighties, the genre reached its peak between 1986 and 1989. Queensryche's visionary Rage For Order and brilliant Operation: Mindcrime, Iron Maiden's Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son albums, Voivod's highly original Nothingface, and especially Metallica's Master Of Puppets and ...And Justice For All represented the best of the lot. Albums of epic length, new advances in hard rock instrumentation, and tons and tons of complicated time signatures characterized the music at the time. All the bands I mentioned took their music in different directions in the Nineties, but thankfully, a decade later, Tool have come back to reinvent progressive metal, with a post-millenial twist.<br />Lateralus is a dense beast of a record. A dank chasm. At least Radiohead's Kid A had some light at the end of the tunnel; on Lateralus, Tool take the listener deeper and deeper. The first listen is a very unsettling seventy-nine minutes to spend, but once you let this album grow and fester inside your cd player, like Kid A, Lateralus achieves a grotesque beauty.<br />The mixing on the cd is intriguing: the bass and drums are pushed way up in the mix, with the guitars and Maynard James Keenan's vocals serving as backing tracks. In all the white-boy rap-metal out there, the bass is always tuned down so low you can hear the strings vibrating, but on Lateralus, Justin Chancellor's bass carries the melody. Even moreso than the bass, Danny Carey's drumming on the album is spectacular throughout.<br />Every song meshes together well on Lateralus. At times it can seem a bit redundant: quiet, then loud, then quiet, then loud, but once you're familiar with the record you begin to tune in to every subtle nuance. The album's highlighs are its middle five songs: 'Mantra', which segues into the mesmerising 'Schism', 'Parabol', which seguesinto the hard-driving 'Parabola', and the outstanding 'Ticks And Leeches'.<br />I can't review the cd without mentioning the highly original artwork. In a time when album art has devolved to nothing more than a cheap booklet in a plastic case, Tool have put out one of the niftiest cd packages I've ever seen. The outer sleeve is semitransparent, almost like an x-ray, and the booklet inside is a clear plastic layered illusteration of a man's profile, like the anatomical layered diagrams you'd find in any encyclopedia.<br />Keenan's lyrics are predictably dark, and often he lacks originality, but he occasionally makes a profound comment that sends the listener reeling. This is best exemplified in the album's title track: &quot;I embrace my desire to feel the rhythm, to feel connected enough to step aside and weep like a widow to feel inspired, to fathom the power, to witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain, to swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human.&quot;<br />Lateralus is a great piece of work, and is the best album of the first half of 2001.
B000002LPD|5.0|This remains the bands heavest studio album. Produceres Andy Johns and vetern Ted Templeman combine forces to give this CD a sound like no other Van Halen album, the guitar is bit thicker as well, as this CD debuted Eddies use of his custom Peavy 5150 amps and Ernie Ball Music Man signature guitar. The music is the most complex the band has put on a CD to date. Darker than OU812, 5150 and Balance, with the mega successful &quot;Right Now&quot; and &quot;Top of the World&quot; being the only popish tunes. Also worth noting, this remains the last great innovative guitar work of Eddie Van Halen.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a wonderful comedy with superb acting and music that the entire family will enjoy.  George Clooney, John Turturro and John Goodman were born to be in this movie but Tim Blake Nelson is one of those rare individuals who's looks alone will have you rolling in the floor with laughter.<br />Don't think you will not like this movie because you don't like bluegrass music.  By the time the movie is over, you will and I would recommend that you order the sound track CD at the same time you are buying this.  This movie will do more for bluegrass music than &quot;Deliverence&quot;.
6300216802|5.0|As I sat back to watch this movie for the unknownth time, I reflected on the negative reviews I had read here earlier that day, and decided that maybe, just maybe, some of those people had a point.  But as I sat back, (after fast-forwarding through the atrocious black screen + Ilea music scene) and the movie encompassed me, my realization became clear and never wavered:<br />This movie is phenomenal.<br />First, I will begin by addressing the most criticisms I have seen:<br />1. The acting is bad: Well, bad isn't quite the word I would use.  Bad acting, to me, comprises such things as mindless droning, stiff body movements, and an overall unconvincing vibe about a character.  I do not think that one person in this movie is at fault with their acting.  Which leads those who would argue against me to say...<br />2. The dialogue is boring and goes on too long:  Frankly, there was not one point in this movie where I felt that the dialogue dragged on, and if it did, then there was usually something else going on to keep my attention.  Some examples would be the final scene with V'Ger, with electrical flashes and a detailed, fascinating set to behold; Spock's denial of the Kolinahr, with the fiery and craggy planet Vulcan; and Kirk and Scotty on the shuttle, with the magnificent ballad accompanying the graceful starship.  Which leads me to another point, more specified, but common nonetheless...<br />3. The shuttle trip to the Enterprise is to F$%@INK long!:  In my opinion, this scene is one of the highlights of the film.  As we see the well acted look of awe and amazement on Admiral Kirk's face, with a tear-moving ballad of the main theme that so perfectly captures his amazement until in a triumphant blast, we are faced with our first front view of the ship, it is a beauty to witness and hear.<br />In conclusion, I will admit to my second point, such as when Ilea puts on her headband; when she plays the game with Decker in the rec room; and when Kirk negotiates for the &quot;withdrawl of the orbiting devices,&quot; but, to quote Bones, &quot;MY GOD, MAN!&quot;  What legitimate movie doesn't have its slow scenes?  Overall, this movie is so much more than a big special effects show.  It is a solid, wonderful masterpiece, and, I might add, is the ONLY movie to truly capture the exploring spirit which was the trademark of the original series and even the idea conveyed by the opening speech at the beginning of EVERY show.
0553573403|4.0|This book was nice. I liked it. I am a Robert Jordan-fan myself, and became curious of this series after seeing in several discussion groups that they compared ASOIAF to WOT, some liked it better and some hated it, but the majority preferred Martin over Jordan. The comparison is somewhat unfair, since this is a series of so far only 3 books, while Jordan's is now 9 and counting. If people instead of comparing ASOIAF to the latest WoT books compared them to the first ones, it would be a whole other story. Martin has yet to prove that he is better than Jordan over a big span of books. The discussion of which series is better than the other is IMHO pointless until both series are complete.<br />This may seem like a bashing, but it's not. It's a great read. Not better than RJ, but still a great read. It's very different from WoT in storyline and so on. The chapters are named after the person whose PoV the chapter is told from. It's annoying at the beginning, but you get used to it. The most significant difference from WoT is that here good guys actually DIES from time to time.<br />And as for not ripping off Dune; Ned Stark vs Duke Leto Atreides, anyone?
B000002G87|5.0|On one hand, it's painful to note the sorry state of Eric Clapton's life at this point - he was in the throes of heroin addiction and in unrequited love with his best friend's wife. But Clapton (with the aid of one of the greatest one-shot bands ever) translated his pain into a &quot;must have&quot; album. Like the epic title track, with its instantly recognizable guitar hook, the songs from &quot;Layla(and Other Assorted Love Songs)&quot; are sometimes bluesy (&quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman,&quot; &quot;Nobody Knows You&quot;), sometimes lyrical (&quot;I Looked Away&quot;, &quot;I am Yours&quot;), sometimes rockin' (&quot;Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad,&quot; &quot;Keep on Growing&quot;)- but all performed with a passion that is at once desparate, dangerous, and beautiful. I defy anyone to listen to Clapton and Duane Allman cranking it out on &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;Little Wing&quot; and not feel his/her knees buckling.
0393038912|5.0|A few years ago, I read an account in the New Yorker of an Eskimo man who entered Harvard and became a stellar student. I was surprised at this, and then, surprised at myself for my reaction. I had prided myself in possessing an egalitarian belief in the capabilities and talents of all people, and was caught up short when I realized that I had questioned the adaptability of a man from what we would call a &quot;primitive&quot; society.<br />In his Pulitzer-prize winning study, Jared Diamond broadens our thinking, providing an antidote for the idea that people from one culture are innately superior to people from any others. He discusses factors like climate, animals suited for domestication, edible native plants, geographic barriers of desert and mountains, and epidemic disease.<br />This book, despite being reader-friendly, is one that will take some concentrated time to digest. Diamond encompasses a variety of scientific disciplines---biology and anthropology, of course, but also physics and climatology, among others. He also incorporates the &quot;humanities&quot; fields of history and philosophy. In the final chapter, in what I see as evidence of both modesty and probing curiosity, he raises a number of questions for further consideration and study.
0783229100|5.0|A great movie everyone should see.  One of the best endings of all time.
B000002NIW|2.0|Boring. If we were only allowed one word to describe an album, that would be it. 5 out of 5? Absolutely amazing? Excuse while I clear up the wet patch I made with my laughter. I mean, yeah! Lets make a wall of fuzz, hit the snare drum about 4 times a minute, whisper into the mic and occasionally scream - but instead of making it a cool, gut wrenching scream, it sounds like a mouse who caught his jabber in his flies. A powerful singer? Bruce Dickenson is a powerful singer. Geoff Tate is a powerful singer. Matt Barlow is a powerful singer. Even King bloody Diamond has a more entertaining voice (albeit for the wrong reasons). Chino Moreno is just an average nu-metal vocalist - nothing more.<br />I suppose I could praise the Deftones for (A) not rapping (most of the time), and (B) putting more than 2 chords in their riffs; but even Slipknot (who are far more commercial) have some degree of excitement and energy. How a group of Deftones fans slagged me off for liking Iron Maiden claiming that they had &quot;no edge&quot; is beyond me. I mean, what is THIS then? The musical equivalent of a ninja scimitar? Nu-metal sucks, and along with Korn, Limp Bizkit, Sevendust, Slipknot and all the other crap that's out there, this is proof why. I know I'm not the most open-minded metaller but I do recognise that Deftones are one of the few slightly intelligent nu-metal bands (Tool being another - I don't like them much but they're better than THIS). But this is boring! The only even slightly bearable songs are Be Quiet And Drive and Headup.<br />And to the reviewer who said this was one of the heaviest albums ever, HA HA!! You're entitled to your opinion but this is not very heavy AT ALL. What is it with you people? Have you never heard of death metal or something?
0783225903|3.0|'Brazil' is, by turns, as disturbing, blackly comic, and visually imaginative as most reviews relate; however, it left me feeling empty, both on seeing it recently, and on its cinematic release some years ago.  Perhaps a film can't do everything, and it is worth sampling this for its satire and hallucinatory production design - analogies with Kafka have been made, and there is something to them, not just in the positive sense but also in the negative - you don't find too many interestingly real human characters, and fewer still human relationships, in Kafka and so it is in 'Brazil'; that both too appear based on dreams is significant - like a dream, 'Brazil' lacks a strong narrative structure, making do instead with an abstracted love interest and the threat of persecution - for me, that's not quite enough to make this deeply moving or memorable.  Despite the dark trappings, it ends up being a bit light and unsatisfying. (It's also interesting to find Tom Stoppard as a screenwriter - his plays, for all their incredible technical skill and overt erudtion, leave me similarly unmoved)   In his production notes, Terry Gilliam states that he wanted to ensure that the audience was 'entertained' - I suppose I'd like a bit more from a film.
B00003CXN4|1.0|Perhaps we are the only people in the country who were dramatically disappointed in the hype regarding Traffic and all of the awards it received, but to our family we found it to be boring, tedious and uneventful.  There are much better movies out there.
B00005ATQD|4.0|Why did Kubrick choose Tom and Nicole for the leads?  This question is put seriously, and is worthy (I think) of an interesting answer.  This film meditates upon sexual desire, trust, fidelity, power, hypocrisy, and here we find an actor and actress, a husband and wife no less, of outstanding commercial success, but whose previous roles had shown them to be performers of limited depth (to be kind) - why pick them?  Are they, in their mediocrity of emotion, meant to represent Hollywood in general?  Or us, the viewing public, or at least the fragment of our desires which coincides with those portrayed onscreen?  Could Kubrick be laughing at Hollywood for its ineffectual and embarassed take on human sexuality?  He has taken two performers who are out and out 'stars', possibly the archetypal Hollywood couple of the time, and asked them to reveal their depths - they appear, at least to me, to be floundering about in a wading pool.  Tom seems incapable of conveying more than one emotion at a time (and even that one is often unconvincing), and Nicole seems more ready to reveal her body (what there is of it) than her psyche.  Kubrick's opus is phenomenal, so he, of all people, must have been aware of his actors' limitations.  So what was the point?  Is he actually revealing the 'stars' to be very ordinary people, people who have no depths, whose passions are as abstract and empty as the passions which see millions of consumers adulating them as 'stars'? When Tom is asked to witness sex, he wears a mask.  Oddly enough, he seems most confident as a screen persona when so adorned.  A mask is no liability for Tom: it is more effective at conveying emotion than his naked face.  Tom appears embarassed by sex and by emotion - think of the scene with the prostitute, or the fact that drugs are required for 'honest' conversations with Nicole.  And are we, while undoubtedly curious, also perhaps a little embarassed at witnessing Nicole nude, at witnessing Tom in close proximity to orgiastic couples?  Wouldn't we rather have Nicole wearing a little bit more?  Have Tom in less compromising surroundings?  Give Kubrick credit - there's a lot more to his films than a spectacularly polished surface; and with this one it's fascinating to speculate what those depths might contain.
0060920084|3.0|Bill Bryson, in a touch of nostalgia for the United States, leaves his family and adopted home in Great Britain for a trip throughout the United States.  He begins and ends his travels in his former home state of Iowa which he finds delightful.  Covering thousands of miles throughout the United States traveling alone by car, he visits numerous cities, small towns and occasional tourist traps. <br />Bryson's stories are hilarious but often have a biting edge to them.  He finds a few places which gratify him, but mostly he finds disappointment.  Too many times he seems to be in places or situations that he does not like.  He often is critical, even nasty, in the descriptions of people he meets along the way.  Although the account of his trip is funny, one is left wondering why he bothered to travel at all if he found so little pleasure in the people and places he encountered.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This album is one of the best produced in the 90's. I have a method to find out its true score-ratings 1. On the Bound:10/10  This is my favourite song on the album-its jerky piano and creschendoes make it spine tingling<br />2. To Your Love: 8/10 More dull, but the climax is to die for, but without it, this song wouldn't do too well.<br />3. Limp: 9/10 This song starts eerily and quietly, and soon explodes, but does come back down. Great suspense is maintained throughout it.<br />4. Love Ridden: 8/10 The tune is more hidden on this one, but the lyrics and piano are haunting<br />5. Paper Bag: 10/10 The first song I'd heard by Fiona, and didn't like it at first, but the tune stuck with me. The lyrics  are so needy and despair-like, it's fun to sing along to.<br />6. A Mistake: 7.5/10 Perhaps the weakest track on the album, it has less piano and this weird trumpet-like noise. Doesn't match my taste.<br />7. Fast As You Can: 10/10 The instrumentation on this one is great, and the drumming on the chorus is the best instrumentation on the album.<br />8. The Way Things Are: 8.5/10 Has a jumpier tune that moves around a bit more.<br />9. Get Gone: 9.5/10 Is very tingly and eery, and makes you gasp for air.<br />10. I Know: 8/10 More of an unremarkable track-nice piano and vocals.<br />The album is amazing, because of the handful of tracks with are gorgeous. The final mark is 88.5%
B00003CXE6|5.0|I was reluctant to watch this movie but when my family insisted on the tape they knew my love for classics would draw me to the screen. The movie takes place just before the death of Marcus Aurelius - Caesar who died in 180 AD. Thereafter, the films takes place over a twelve year period during the reign of the Roman Emperor Commodus. While the film takes artistic license with Crowes Character - purely for entertainment purposes (which a movie should be - fun) there are interesting historical refernces to the barbarian tribes to the North/Northeast of the Roman Empire who were defeated (mostly yes by fire) and the sheer ingenuity of the Roman army. The Crowe character finds himself torn between a promise to return Rome to a Republic and the  vicious Emperor who of course want's to maintain the rule of the Caesar's. Crowes character is written with heroic proportion and survives years of sufffering and near death episodes before being returned to Rome. Why no one ages in the film especially the Emperor's nephew Lucious is anyone's guess. However, the entertaining fight of good versus evil is well worth the price of the film. It was a real treat to  see Derek Jacobi of &quot;I Claudius&quot; in the film, as well as marvelous performances all around.
0790729407|2.0|It all looked so promising - at last, a big-budget movie about Ireland's history and actually directed and screenwritten by an Irishman! Tax breaks from the Irish government and thousands of Dubliners willing to work for free as extras gave it an added boost.   So what went wrong? First of all, we have the Oirish cliches. Take this one. Mr Collins makes a speech on a donkey cart. There were such things as platforms in early 20th century Ireland, but let that pass. Then the polis come. Collins gets down from the cart and headbutts someone. Mob take out many hurleys and start headwhacking. The whys and wherefores are a mystery here. It's the modern version of the obligatory barfight scene. Irish public are violent louts whose innate thuggery must be harnessed by a fellow thug in order to behave loutishly towards bigger thugs?    Did anyone actually read the facts about the IRA campaign of guerilla warfare? We get the idea that the whole war, though outwardly aimed at England, is just an internal squabble - which is exactly how the English tried to portray it.     And then the story. It is well known that most real lives don't translate very well to the screen, so subtelty and imagination must be applied liberally. Unfortunately, Collins's true story doesn't lend itself very well to a movie, as the story of, say, Patrick Pearse or Eamon de Valera would. Their lives had real cinematic qualities - heroism, political vision, idealism etc, that is lacking here. Instead of fictionalising the character, which is usually necessary for a successful dramatic narrative, Jordan used the actual facts and twisted them, which only usually works in history, when the historian isn't very particular about the truth. Thus, instead of being a valuable asset to the republican movement, Collins *is* the republican movement. One doesn't wish to underestimate Collins's role, but it was almost exclusively in intelligence. Think of how interesting a film based on Collins's espionage might havebeen, instead of the fruitless insistence that he was the Big Fella, he really was!    Instead of the statesman that he was (recognised all but officially as the President of the Irish Republic in America, where he toured and raised funds in 1919-20), de Valera 'becomes' a mere conniver, whose only interest is...well, it's not explained, really, but we just *know* he's evil. To set the record straight, all Jordan's insinuations about his motives are wrong. He did not suddenly jump from being a little, egotistical man, to one known internationally for his integrity and his opposition to imperialism - and fascism - overnight. He also had a much greater involvement in the War of Independence than he's given credit for, and neither he nor Brugha approved of Collins's occasional 'revenge' killings. And so on.     As for the acting, the standard was poor. Neeson was alright, but the others were, frankly, atrocious. (Poor aul' Harry Boland, portrayed as a weakling by Quinn, was most definitely *not*  killed in a sewer but gunned down in a hotel room by a murder gang. And why was Dev, in his 30s at the time, made to look old enough to be a grandfather? That's apart from the fact that they really should have given him a moustache to twirl to make him the complete stage villian. And let's not mention the woeful miscasting of Julia Roberts...)    Such a pity, really. I think we all in Ireland deserve a better showing, really, after so much Hollywood misinterpretation of Ireland.
B000053SPI|5.0|A new Journey album is always good for some hefty debate but Arrival has been food for discussion more than ever. Not strange if you think that for the first time in   ages the band changed vocalists. The legendary Steve Perry took off and was replaced by \\"newcomer\\" Steve Augeri.  Even before they had heard any new material some people could tell this could never be as good as the stuff with Perry. Others, who did see them on tour in the US, told   us that Augeri was way better than Perry.  And then there was the \\"riot\\" over the Napster version of the album. People were very harsh on that one. The production [stunk], the songs [stunk] and Journey could   actually better call it quits&#8230;  So I was curious, of course I was. I&#8217;ve been a Journey fan ever since I heard songs from Captured on the radio back in nineteeneightysomething and to be honest I had   my doubts about Steve Augeri as well. I don&#8217;t care much for the Tall Stories and Tyketto albums he sang on and in my heart I was afraid he would have the same   effect on Arrival.  But after listening to the album more than a few times I can honestly say that Mr. Augeri surprises me very much on Journey&#8217;s newborn. Surely you hear he isn&#8217;t Steve   Perry, but I dare say he&#8217;s in the same league on this one as he makes Arrival feel like an up to par Journey album, no doubt. The rockers&#8230; the ballads&#8230; he handles   them all like he&#8217;s never been doing anything else then singing in Journey.  So, now that the worries about the vocalist are out of the way, what about the songs? Do they [stink}, and what about the production? Does it [stink] too? Well, no! In fact   this is one of the best Journey albums I&#8217;ve ever heard.   Just like Trial By Fire the album is a bit ballad heavy but I don&#8217;t mind that at all as a good ballad belongs to AOR just as much as a juicy rocker does. And Journey has   always been a band with great ballads. Remember Faithfully or Send Her My Love?  But there are quite some good rockers to be found on the album as well. Just take a listen to the incredible Higher Place or the bonus track To Be Alive Again and   you&#8217;ll know what I mean. Yeah, but that&#8217;s only two, I hear you say. Okay, take a listen to the midtempo monsters All The Things and I Got A Reason then. Or to Signs   Of Life, which is an emotional song yes, but hardly a ballad to these ears.   Admitted, if the band had chosen another sequence of songs the album would have had a rockier overall sound as from the eighth track on to song number twelve it&#8217;s all   ballads we&#8217;re treated to. But hey, these ballads are of a quality you very often can only dream about.   The final two songs are of a heavier caliber again, but that doesn&#8217;t change the soft feel of the second half of the album anymore. Still, considering the high class of the   songs (there&#8217;s literally no filler on the album) this is all just splitting hairs. And for those of you still not convinced, the band is planning on releasing a different version of   the album for the US and European market, which will have a more heavy character. It&#8217;s due out in February and if it really differs a lot from the Japanese version, you&#8217;ll   find the review of it in Majestic Magazine towards that time.

6305165912|5.0|if you haven't seen this movie, please see it. The Big Lebowski is such a brilliant movie, that i have trouble explaining it in words. I have seen it more than 50 times, (literally!) and EVERY SINGLE TIME that i see it, it gets funnier and funnier. The dude, Jeff Bridges, is a slacker without a job or any money that likes to bowl. One day, he unknowingly and unwantingly gets involved in a scheme that involves a millionaire with the same name as him, his feminist daughter, his nympho wife bunny, three german nihilists, a porno king, and his two buds. The Big Lebowski is a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant movie, and i urge you to please see this immediately so that you know what i am talking about. You will THANK ME after you see this movie!
B000002J03|5.0|Why are people posting reviews about Led Zeppelin not being heavy?  Why do you even want to rate an album on being heavy?  Rate it on passion and musicianship. Then you have people saying Led Zeppelin sold out and they were all mediocre.  That's a pretty bold thing to say about a band who hardly released any singles (and none in the UK).  They hadn't even released any singles by the end of their first American tour and they were filling up venues.  That's not selling out (conforming to the scene), that's talent.  Then at the end of their career, Jimmy Page had to do the stage announcements for the band, playing clubs.  They didn't break up, they rambled on.<br />Ramble On, indeed, a nice segue to talk about my favorite song on the album.  I had seen Train play this song live not too long ago.  I'm 17, so I never got to see the Zeppelin legacy, but getting to see Train play Ramble On fulfilled me.  This album is passionate, full of meaning, very talented, thunderous, and if you listen to it, it's even heavy (even if that doesn't matter).  Think about this: Heartbreaker, Living Loving Maid, Ramble On, Moby Dick... wow.  I'm sure anyone who would sit down and listen to those songs over and over would realize something about Led Zeppelin.  Talented, passionate, and rock legends.  You don't need radio airplay to become huge.  They became huge before the radio stations started playing all their stuff in the 80s and 90s.  Excellent Album.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Jar Jar Binks. A fine idea: introduce a character who is so aggravating and without purpose that only a terrible case of amnesia would alleviate our pain. Clearly a cheap sequel, why did we expect otherwise? We Foolish Fans. George, I want my money back. On second thought, if this lightweight excuse for a movie is evidence of a drinking problem you may have developed, perhaps you can use my $7.50 along with everyone elses to pay for a quality treatment center. Let's just hope their treatment of you is better than your treatment of us.
B000002W9Q|5.0|Dirty Dancing brings back many good memories. It truly is a wonderful film in that it does'nt come across as a routine, sloppy production like so many love stories can be. What compliments the ethos of the film is the sizzling soundtrack. The story in the film is set in the 1960's though the majority of it's soundtrack are tracks recorded in the 1980's and they do admitedly sound very distinctive to that era but never the less it still makes for a tremendously enjoyable soundtrack. I've Had The Time Of My Life is a song that forever will be associated with Dirty Dancing and it's an absolutley magnificent recording at that. as the song plays you almost visualise the triumphant climax of the film where Patrick swayze and Jennifer grey do some electricifying dancing. Be my Baby is a fantastic soul classic sung by the highly underated group, The Ronettes where as Patrick Swayze surprisingly puts in a stunning and powerful performance on the breathtakingly beautiful, She's Like's The Wind. Hungry Eyes is another stand out track. With it's beautiful musical arrangements and a fabulous performance from Eric Carmen, the tack is quite simply a classic - a vastly underated one1 Every track on here is an absolute clasic with main highlights being glorious soul classics like Stay by William and Maurice, the silly butfun Love Is Strange, Overload and more contemporary recordings like the swinging, Yes and the totally magnificent, Where Are You Tonight? Superb recordings all round from an equally superb, classic movie. Highly Recommended!
6303921248|5.0|I love how this 6-part mini series presents Jane Austen's novel. There is no &quot;Hollywood twist&quot; or &quot;poetic license&quot;. If you read the book you will see that the producers used it like a script.  The BBC are famous for presenting novels accurately which makes us purists happy!  I love Colin Firth's portrayal as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Miss Elizabeth Bennett.  Crispin Bonham-Carter as Mr. Bingley is charming as well.  Actually all the actors were well suited to their roles.  You might gasp when you see the price of the videos, but believe me, but they are worth the money.  Each video is approx. 50 min. in length, so watch them at a time when you have 5 hours to spare, as they are hard to stop watching!  If you have more discipline (LOL) they are nice to watch in installments, &quot;one&quot; per night!

B00005BJ2O|4.0|It has been decades since a musical has done really well at the box office and produced a popular soundtrack album to boot (Grease and Saturday Night Fever come to mind).  The Moulin Rouge Soundtrack boasts a very eclectic and intriguing use of modern music spanning thirty years of popular hits from the '60's to present. Hearing the music in the context of the movie truly enhances the experience, and in addition to purchasing the CD, I will definitely be keeping an eye out for the DVD release.  I have heard much criticism of the rendition of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, but personally I feel that &quot;The Ladies of Moulin Rouge&quot; have done a great job of capturing the energy of this hit; the only complaint I have is that it is being killed by massive overplay on the radio. Other notable performances include Ewan McGregor's rendition of Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot;; he also demonstrates his vocal versatility in the &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; and the ballad &quot;Come What May&quot;. Although she does not possess the same vocal power or range as her co-star, Nicole Kidman does a fabulous job with a heart rending performance of &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot;, and a version of &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot;, which is as breathy as Marilyn Monroe's original. &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;, Fatboy Slim's &quot;Because We Can&quot; and a catchy dance version of DeBarge's &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot; round out the set, and evoke the hectic excitement and glamor of the Moulin Rouge.  Beck's &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; and Bono's &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; capture the dark decadence of the 'Belle Epoque' or 'beautiful period' during which the Moulin Rouge was established. The only real disappointment here is in what the soundtrack excluded, particularly &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and Jim Broadbent's haunting rendition of Queen's &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;. Perhaps these were withheld to facilitate a well known marketing ploy; we'll just haveto shell out for the release of &quot;More Music From the Moulin Rouge&quot;.

B00004XOWM|1.0|This is awful.  I'll agree with other reviwers and say their bassist is good, and I can't deny Wes Borland looks cool.  But everything else - Fred's embarrassing lyrics (\\"I'm gonna fly like an eagle to my destiny\\") and complete lack of rap skills.  The drumming is mediocre.  DJ Lethal deserves to die for the mangling he makes of some songs, especially \\"Getcha Groove On\\", which is the worst song on the album.  It's fun to listen if only to laugh at Durst's unintentionally funny lyrics, or to play spot the swipe,  wherein you try to guess which other artists the band has been [listening to].  Durst doesn't realise that people don't hate him in a Sex Pistols/Eminem/NWA kinda way, but in a Spice Girls way. To all the 14 year olds buying this - I predict in three or four years you'll look back with utter horror at being in a Limp fan, in the same way as NSYNC and Britney fans will.
B00004YKUX|5.0|There is no doubt that Johnny Cash is a living legend.  He still stands as one of the greatest entertainers off all time, and this CD prooves it even more.  It gives you a feel of what Johnny Cash is all about and that's truth.  He tells the truth in these songs.  Most of the songs are not originals but Johnny turns them into his own.  The sad thing is is if this is Johnny Cash's last album, he finished it perfectly reflecting all he is and about with &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;.  This is a must have if you're a Cash fan.

This compilation has been put together by Bruce's widow Linda Lee Cadwell after her husband's untimely demise.  Bruce did not want this book to be a used as a guide.  He wanted this to provide an insight into his opinions about the world of martial arts, oriental philosophy (Tai'chi etc) and the principles which would make a perfect martial artist.  It is a must for every serious martial arts practitioner.  It goes well with Bruce's assertions on no mindedness and having no form as the ultimate form.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Whether you like slipknot or not, you cant say nothing about their style. Their music and personas are very innovative, sort of like Kiss was when they were on the rise.  Its gotta grow on you for sure. Whens the last time you heard a band like this? Never. And that is why theyre so popular.  The old metal is good, but were in the year 2001. People always crave something different and slipknot delivers it in the hugest way. Maybe their second one will change some minds on the direction this type of music is going.

0812550757|5.0|After Ender's Game I just had to continue reading more, so I got Speaker for the Dead.  It is a wonderful, thought provoking book that I know I'll have to pick up again.  It is a great story of humans relating to an alien culture.  You can't help but wonder, should we have interfered?  Should we share our knowledge with them?  What will happen if we don't?  Just speaking with them lets things slip out, and then more &quot;contamination&quot;.  That is just such an awsome line of thought to follow.<br />Then you can look at the story as, perhaps, relating to different races, or perhaps religions, etc.  It really makes you think with all the &quot;what-ifs&quot; that come up.  I want to read this book again in the future and see what else I can get out of it.  <br />Of course, now I have to read the next book to see where this series goes from here.  Mr. Card has written a wonderful series for anyone to read, whether you like sci-fi, or just good, thought provoking reading.
B00000FBRE|4.0|This is a great cd, don't get me wrong. I first got Double Plaidinum by Lagwagon and it was awesome. Well, I had high hopes for this cd, and maybe that is why I was slightly disappointed. My favorite songs are: &quot;After you, my friend,&quot; &quot;Train,&quot; and &quot;May 16,&quot; which is also on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater #2. The first few times you listen to this cd, you'll like the songs, but as you listen to it more, the songs start to get very repetitive and monotonous. All the songs start to sound the same. But, this is still a great cd, but if you're just getting into Lagwagon, pick of D. Plaid instead.

Al Pacino, and Robert DeNiro are my favorite actors and they are both in one of the movies but Pacino is the best in this movie.  Do yourself a favor and ORDER IT.  Don't disappoint the Godfarther.
B00003CX8V|1.0|The Apartment is one of my favorite Billy Wilder films and is required viewing for anyone interested in movies. I just wish I could be as enthusiastic about this  DVD release. The DVD seems to have been taken from a less-than-perfect copy of the film, with lots of dirt and  scratches (artifacts) and so much edge enhancement that the pictures literally jumps and skitters on the screen. The onderful early scene in the office are ruined by the amount of shimmer and shake on the screen. Maybe someday the movie will be given a delux treatment and cleaned up. We can only hope.
B00003CXE7|1.0|poorly directed, written, acted, photographed, designed, edited.  everything about this movie is from a technical and entertainment standpoint very BAD.  it's totally muddled, one-sided, ridiculous, inaccurate, and silly.  avoid at all costs
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is my favorite c.d of all time. It has Hotdog,My way and both versions of Rollin. If you are a rock fan this is a must buy c.d.
B000002H2H|5.0|My, how things can change in one year. Now that Metallica had gotten the kick-butt debut out of the way, they could focus more on which direction they wanted to go in. They decided to start a little bit on the longer song structures and they added an instrumental in for good measure----a great one too! This is the shortest of all the Metallica albums at 47 minutes, but it may be the sweetest. It is probably the easiest to digest out of the first four; Kill 'Em All too thrash metal and Master of Puppets and especially And Justice For All too complex and drawn-out with the song structures. This album is a perfect cross. James Hetfield also toned the screaming down on this album; although he can still let out a loud scream any time he feels like it, and it is still just as powerful, he doesn't feel like it as often anymore. The lyrics are also getting more intelligent; as teenagers making their debut they went with all the typical heavy metal topics, on this album they branch out. Still no love song from Metallica yet (wait until &quot;The Black Album&quot; for that.) <br />As a general rule, with the exception of &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls,&quot; the longer four songs are better than the shorter four on this album. Although &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; (great acoustic intro!), &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot; fit well into the mold of the album, they just aren't as good as the other tracks, mainly because it's hard to be as good as some of the other tracks. Now for the highlights, in order as they appear on the album:<br />1. Ride The Lightning-it's worth it for the short intro and outro alone. Just a great rockin' song. 2. For Whom The Bell Tolls---WOW! From the perfect use of the bells to a perfect way to execute a bit of a slower feel to the song, this song rocks! One complaint: With the 2-minute intro, they could have made this song a little longer than 5:10. 3. Fade To Black---This one started a tradition of track 4 on Metallica albumsbeing the slow ballad. This one has one long instrumental solo to end it, and it is good---it is a beautiful song...you certainly couldn't see the &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot; Metallica doing this...it's a sign of maturity. 4. Creeping Death---I don't know what it is about this song, but it just awes me every time I listen to it even though nothing seems special or unusual about it. 5. The Call of Ktulu---This is the instrumental I talked about to earlier. It is supposed to be a thematic journey to hell; it is very chilling when you listen to it and think of it that way. This is the longest song on their first three albums at 8:55---not even anything on the complex-song-structured &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; topped the length of this epic!<br />Overall, a great album and definitely the easiest to digest among the first four. Still heavy, but with a bit of maturity this time. Of course, this was only a prelude of what was to come...
B00004Z459|4.0|I hadn't listened to only one track before getting this cd, and it was enough to convince me into bying it. This cd is great all over from the beginning to the end, and they sound like a P.O.D. and Limp Bizkit mix. My personal favourites are Points Of Authority and Forgotten. This is just as great as their previous cd (Hybrid Theory EP), except that this one has a lot more tracks and it rules, you gotta get it.
B00003CXRP|3.0|FedEx FedEx FedEx. The poor schmuck is stranded on a desert island yet they still manage to get the FedEx logo plastered 10 feet tall across the screen. At times the gigantic FedEx logos made it difficult to focus on what the characters were doing. Once you finally notice it, it is terribly distracting from the story and the scenery. Without the &quot;product placement&quot; beast I would have enjoyed this movie enough to buy a copy, but in the theatre I was actually turning from the screen when next 3 minite period elapsed and it was time for another FedEx logo to appear. Truly, it severely hurt the movie and instead of adding a little realism to it, it came off like a big FedEx commercial, even the ending which would have been touchingly sweet was more a FedEx endorsement (neither rain, nor snow nor deserted island can ...) Tom Hanks was brilliant but he played second fiddle to the FedEx logo. Helen Hunt played - er, well she played Helen Hunt. Whatever movie HH plays in she always plays the same character, only the name and circumstances change. Too bad really, she can be charming, but she needs to explore a little and play something besides the sweet, semi-innocent, semi-feminist, semi-emotional, all-American girl. Just once, I would like to see her cast as a baddie, or a vamp, or anything else.
B00003CXAA|5.0|this is one of the very few highly anticipated dvds that i ahve been anticipating myself.  part 3 is not so great of a movie, but 1 is utterly profound and 2 is excellent as well.  if you have or haven't ever seen these movies, there is no doubt in my mind that you won't be happy with this collection
0790731940|2.0|I rented this film after being impressed by James Garner's portrayal of Woodrow F Call in Streets of Laredo.  Most of the cast seem to be having a great time but too many jokes fall flat.  Neither Gibson and Foster seem to have a clue playing Western characters.  Like Billy Crystal in City Slickers with none of the irony.   The film is lighthearted with chuck wagon loads of old TV western cliches.  Guns being shot off peoples hands, Mel rescuing a run-away stagecoach, and a Royal Flush winning hand.  Yawn. (Which shows how brilliant Spielberg was in Raiders of the Lost Ark, bringing a fresh variation to a tired action sequence.)  Its all done by the numbers with no inspiration.  If you're looking for a film about clever slight of hand and humourous double crosses you're better off watching The Sting with Newman and Redford.<br />The movie was a great re-union of old TV western stars, country singers, and modern actors.  I wish they remembered to make a movie worth renting.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The is the best group of songs, best album, best band in the whole world.  What more can you ask for?  This is a good buy for the money.  Each song is priceless and cost less than a dollar each.  I know this doesn't have ALL their great songs, yes, there is a lot more great and priceless songs, but this will do.  It didn't suprise me one bit when I heard this album went right to number 1.  I have ALL the Beatles' albums and I couldn't resist buying this one.  Every song sounds so great, I love this album.  If you own this album, good for you, if not, go out and buy it immediately, you won't be disappointed.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Limp Bizkit is the original and everlasting Rock-Rap king for me, so it ain't a surprise coming out of my mouth that this cd rocks. Along all those rocking melodic shouting are also a couple of slow songs, which are good too but not too much for my taste. My favourites are Nobody Like You and Nookie. Anyway, you like anything like this you gotta buy it.
B00003CXP1|4.0|Watching the clips for this film on the Tonight show, I really thought this was going to be a film centered on the activities and heartaches of some dotty old ladies in a retirement community. Like many of you I am a big fan of David Aranofsky's &quot;Pi&quot; so I should have known better. I liked this film very much but it is one of the hardest films you will ever want to watch.  The characters in this film are not deeply likeable or even people you would want to have over for dinner with the exception of Jennifer Connelly who has never seemed so breathtakingly radiant as she is in the first half of the film.  But they are real people and whatever their flaws, it is really hard to watch them take this dark dark journey. Due to Aranofsky's stylized cinematography, you get in the heads of these people and you take the journey with them. Its a real unpleasant trip but when it is over you realize this is a movie that actually took you someplace and gave you an experience that you have never had from watching a movie like Traffic or Trainspotting.  When you are done you have been somewhere and its very personal. It will stick with you.
B00005BJPO|2.0|the animation is excellent, and if you're an anime fan then do it.  this is the beethoven of anime, but anime in itself doesn't have a lot to offer.  if i had to recommend one anime movie though, it would be akira
B00003CXRM|4.0|A truly superb movie. Funny, memorable, and a feast for the eyes and ears (the soundtrack CD is a definite keeper as well). Clooney carried the movie wonderfully, and his two sidekicks were remarkable as well.
0553573403|5.0|With the hundreds of fantasy novels that I have read, and have become makeshift door stoppers, its great to finally read one that is wothy to sit next to Book one of the Wheel of Time. George Martin is one of those phenomenal writers that not only tells a tale, but makes the reader feel at one with charcaters. Characters that experience so much pain and tribulation that the reader wants to jump in and save them form their most certain peril.  Fantasy books have been becoming stale over the last couple of years with so many copycat writers changing character names and settings yet sticking to the same plots weve all read time and time agian.  Martin destroys the prefabricated storylines and places his charcters in situations where they can not survive and live happily ever after and where honor and dignity are not always one in the same. Basically, a fantasy story that has a real life twist. A job well done on a magnificent piece of literature.
B00004TWZF|4.0|I have to thank all the &quot;Amazonians&quot; who wrote reviews on The Big Blue. I am a fan of The Fifth Element and so found myself surfing Luc Besson films here. I absolutely despised this film and counted it among rhe worst films of all time. I could not fathom Jaques decision to leave Johanna and the baby. And in the American version it ends with what I considered a surreal &quot;art film&quot; garbage finale which I thought was one of the stupidest things I had ever seen in a film to that point.     Well I was shocked to see so many great reviews for this film and decided to give this Director's version another chance.  I am happy to say I have totally turned around on this film.  In retrospect I watched The Big Blue years ago in VHS mono on a 19&quot; tv and fell asleep and missed about twenty minutes.  And while I probably still would have liked it this time on a 27 inch set, I saw it projected on a ten foot screen in Dolby stereo surround. This film benefits from a big screen experience as it really has a chance to envelope you.  I can not compare the music as many have.  But the additional footage and ending made the film a far more pleasant experience. The ending which seemed out of left field and bizarre in the American version is replaced with a destination which fits more satisfyingly. This original Euro version is  more grounded on this planet while still retaining a magical quality.  Also better is Jaques rival Enzo (Jean Reno) who seems merely driven by competition in the American version. Here we find Enzo is actually a more endearing friend. While he is a macho guy who likes to puff a bit, he has humor and seems far less driven and single minded. I liked and appreciated the romance this time out. And for what its worth (maybe I was asleep the first time) but there are some nice love scenes with Rosanna I didn't remember. So to make a long story shorter, not only do I no longer hate &quot;The Big Blue&quot; I also own the DVD and can recommend it.
B00003CXB2|5.0|i was totally hesitant to watch this movie some years ago but when i came upon owning a widescreen director's cut of the movie, i decided to watch it.  it's everything it's cracked up to be.  excellent directino by lean, great acting, excellent script.  the long running time is well worth the watch.  i highly recommend
0380973650|5.0|&quot;American Gods&quot; is a superior achievement in fantasy. At once, vivid and surreal, intense and inventive, mythological and technological, bold and engrossing. Powerfully haunting and hypnotizing, &quot;American Gods&quot; is a novel that rips the cover off America, for a look seldom seen, rarely looked for, and the Gods that reside there in this much darker version of Kerouac's &quot;On The Road&quot;, and Gaiman at his imaginative and storytelling best... Gary S. Potter Author/Poet
B00005LB9O|5.0|With R.E.M. and Radiohead both releasing stellar albums within the month, the idea of releasing a new Travis album may have seem mis-timed, due to the lack of available attention.  I see now that this collection of twelve tracks (and two quality bonus tracks) would have been appropriate at any time, for the sound used on The Invisible Band is priceless.<br />Highlights include the single &quot;Sing&quot;, the John Denver-positive &quot;Flowers In The Window&quot;, and the unfortunately-titled, yet incredibley powerful &quot;Humpty Dumpty Love Song&quot;.  But the fact of the matter is, every song stands out and is pleasing to the ears. Travis' actual musical abilities aren't exactly revolutionary or even unique, but the formulas and cliches that they do use are used in a proper manner and tend to add to the tracks, not diminish them.<br />Calling Travis Radiohead-lite is unfair to both bands, because (though they share a producer) their ambitions are not at all similar.  Whereas Radiohead is out to challenge the boundaries of musical acceptance, Travis justs wants to sing, sing, sing, sing. And they're damn good at it.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Que se puede usar para calificar este CD?, no hay adjetivo. Es un excelente CD con ritmos variados que van desde neo-punk (Warning), msica &quot;rabe&quot; (Misery), punk (Dead Beat Holiday, Church on Sunday, Minority), country (Hold On). Aunque este sea el ms corto CD de Green Day, es el que tiene canciones ms largas, se puede llegar a decir, el ms Pop.
B00003CX8V|5.0|an excellent performance by billy wilder, jack lemmon, and shirley maclaine.  definitely worth watching for everyone.  potent humour and drama all at the same time.  the only complaint is about 20-30 minutes of overlength, which is typical of most good movies of the time (i know, a sweeping generalization -- but i find it to be true for most good movies of the 40s, 50s, and early 60s).  worth owning
0441008356|4.0|&quot;Revelation Space&quot; is a hard space opera of a powerful and new imagination. Riveting and wholly inventive; Reynold's uses a backdrop as broad and as infinite as the universe itself. Reynold's is a bright new star in the field of SF, and writing as mind expanding and as bold as Baxter, Banks, and Clarke... Gary S. Potter Author/Poet.
B00005AQFC|5.0|I love this version even better than the original because it is edited.  Thanks for that Snoop (and whoever is involved with that).  Outstanding cd!
6304546947|2.0|What does it take to be successful? Money, prestige, social standing and a great career are the typical answers to the question.  Seven of today's New Age thinkers share their insights and knowledge about what it means to be successful. None of their answers are the conventional ones that you have heard time and time again.<br />  Bernie Siegel, Marianne Williamson and the rest of their colleagues take you on an etheral mystical journey on your quest to success. As each one gets caught up in their philosophy of success you are wondering if they truly know what they are talking about. You are bounced around from individual to individual expounding on how to become a free spirit, releasing your fears, having an abundance mentality and recovering your vitality. After listening and watching this group you will fall into boredom.<br />  If you really want to know the path to success find a tape in which one personality is featured. Seven of them is just too much and in most cases they're repeating the same things you've already heard from their books and in life. Is this an inspiring tape? I wouldn't say so. The value of this tape is its introduction of seven popular new age thinkers. Other than that try it at another time.
B00000F5KH|1.0|this ridiculous rip-off of millions of other movies deservedly won the oscar for best foreign movie ONLY because best foreign movie entails being really saucy, melodramatic, boring, and involving a cute kid.  if you fell for tripe like all about my mother, cinema paradiso, life is beautiful, etc. then feel blissful watching this.  honestly no new ideas here, and the acting wasn't anything extraordinary contrary to what people say.  <br />note: the christian references/subtext are totally unnecessary and cheesy.  <br />1 star for decent cinematography
B000002NE4|1.0|Talk about the stark, minimal, heartfelt intensity of this album boggles my mind. 'The Boatman's Call' is a cheap, lazy mess. If you're going to cut down to bare essentials, you need to make sure they're, you know -- good. <br />Nothing on TBC rises above mildly enjoyable so-so-ness. I have nothing against minimal songwriting in and of itself, and I can stomach a few love songs if the lyrics are interesting and aesthetically solid. But TBC doesn't make the cut. <br />First of all, the melodies are not so much minimal as they are simplistic. Simplistic and cheesy. Simplistic and cheesy are only forgivable if one is striving for quirk value, and it's evident that Nick Cave isn't. It's supposed to be heartfelt and sparse. Maybe it works for you, but not for me. Most of the melodies on this album can't possibly have taken more than a half-hour to compose, tweak, and lay down in their entirety. Whereas one senses the sheer time and energy that went into crafting a song such as, say, 'The Curse of Millhaven,' or 'Lay Me Low,' or 'Loverman' or 'Song of Joy' or any of numerous others, one can easily imagine throwing together a song like 'Into My Arms' in about an hour on a 4-track at home (then listening to it later, saying &quot;Man, what was I thinking!&quot; -- and *scrapping* the sorry thing.) <br />Additionally, the lyrics are awful. They are either overly sappy, head-scratchingly clumsy, or laugh-out-loud stupid. An occasional nice bit of descriptive phrasing will slip through the cracks (which I take for Cave's *actual* talent trying *desperately* to find a place to squeeze itself on to this record) -- but most of the lyrics are head-shakingly bad. Anyone who's listened to more than one Nick Cave album knows that, if nothing else, he can certainly pull some interesting lyrical gymnastics. They've always been a bit cumbersome, but are generally impressive, with an evident degree of time and thought put into them. On TBC, Cave seems to want to keep it simple. And whileI know that musicians are going to try something different here and there, I simply don't think Cave writes &quot;simple&quot; lyrics that well. They just come out really awkward. The first line of the album is: &quot;I don't believe in an interventionist God,&quot; sung in a very serious, romantic sort of way. It has to be the goofiest and most ineffectual opening to what is -- I *think* -- supposed to be a touching love song, that I have ever heard. Way too literal. If you're going to plop a word like &quot;interventionist&quot; into a love song, you have to be a great deal craftier about it than Cave is here. <br />But really, a line like that is nothing compared to much of the lame vocal filler to come. &quot;Black hair, black hair. Beautiful black hair. Such black hair. Black hair, oh, it is black, yes, and it is beautiful. Very black hair. I like your black hair. Black hair. La la.&quot; Are there actually people who listen to that song (titled, appropriately, 'Black Hair') and feel -- touched or something? I've seen better song lyrics (and concepts) out of highschool freshman. <br />Simple, heartfelt intensity? If you say so. I say it's a clumsy failure, a bore to listen to, disappointing both musically and lyrically. The Boatman's Call is in fact, to date, the only album I've heard from Cave and his group that I would consider truly lousy. Better luck on 'No More Shall We Part.'
B00000IPAX|3.0|Blink was doing great until Enema. They had hits but were still their same original punk rock. &quot;Dammit&quot;, &quot;Josie&quot;, &quot;M&amp;M's&quot;. Those were great songs that were on the radio and were giving them success, why did they have to come out with this stuff. To me, it's just not Blink. It doesn't have the energy of Dude Ranch or Cheshire Cat. Maybe just cause I've listened to Blink since the days those CD's came out. I don't know, I just can't get into Enema. I don't get why Blink just didn't stick with their originality. I think they would have done just as good, but still had the respect of the true Blink punk fans. I also just listened to Take Off Your Pants... and they're heading towards the right track, but there are still some poppy songs, but definitely a lot better than Enema, but not the same as Dude Ranch or Cheshire, don't think anything will compare.
B00005ATZT|4.0|im typically not a harrison ford, tommy lee jones, or an andrew davis fan, but this captures very well what it wants to do.  drama/action fans take note.  probably the best that davis will ever pull off
B00005BJC7|5.0|I find Radiohead's music very soothing despite it's sometimes disturbing themes. It's a great anecdote to the stress of modern life. I listened to Kid A obsessively for weeks and never got tired of it. I think Amnesiac has the same effect. There is great depth of feeling. The only thing I was disappointed with was the limited edition book. I thought it was kind of a wasted effort.
B00003W8NM|5.0|It would be easy to say that all Fight Club is is a place where men can act on their anger. It would be easy to say this, but it it would not be true. Fight Club is whatever you want it to be.  Meet Edward Norton. We are not told his character's name in this movie. The reason for this might be that he is a representative of all the men like him. He is stuck in a job he hates, and goes to 12- step meetings in order to make himself feel better. Whenever he is seated on a plane, he has sadistic images in his head of the plane going down, and he hopes that it will, but it doesn't. It is on a plane that he meets Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt), who tells him that the only use of the oxygen masks are to give the passengers a high so that they will accept their fate. He seems to see right through Norton in a way that is very strange. The only thing that we find out about Durden is that he likes to play pranks such as changing the chemical content of a customer's soup(You get what I mean) and snipping a frame of adult film into a children's movie. Norton stays with Durden in a run down house because his apartment blew up and then Marla(Helena Bonham Carter) comes into the picture. She is an angry chain smoker who seems to dislike all of the men that she's with. Norton recognizes her from one of his self help groups.  One night Durden wants to fight with Norton just to get him to loosen up and so they fight. They continue to fight every night or so for a while and then they get noticed. More people want to join them and eventually they have a large following. They then fight in a basement under a bar and the group gets more organized. Durden then thinks up homework assignments so to speak for the members to complete. The homework assignments consist of vandalization and getting into a fight with someone. This is all in their benefit because it will set them free from their sad lives. The Fight Club seems to change from a group which causes small time mahem to a blown out terrorist organization. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a dark film with the violence that is evident in many of David Fincher films such as &quot;Se7en&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;. The screenplay was written by Jim Uhls which was based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. This is definitely not a movie for everyone. Some people may walk out of this one feeling like they have to vomit while some may feel different in a way that cannot be explained. They may want to see this one again because it is impossible to analyze &quot;Fight Club&quot; in one viewing.
B00004Z400|5.0|Now it may be a arguable statement, but the Deftones are the greatest hardrock band to ever be around.  Listening to Adrenaline got you hooked, the raw hardcore thrashes and the unconventional lyrics brought them into your eyes.  Then in Around the Fur came the more revolutionary hardcore tracks.  My Own Summer, and Headup seem to live forever in the minds of deftone fans.  I have been to several deftones concert and i have seen no other match the intensity or the energy of those guys. it gets no better.  Oh, yeah, if you love limp bizkit, dont buy this because if you like them, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED to listen to the deftones because you are a POP-ROCK weiner...
B00000K19E|1.0|extremely bad writing (what is this ridiculous religious subtext mixed in with insane inaccuracy and \\"my way or the highway\\" dialogue???), extremely bad acting.  the special effects are not very good and are often very out of place (the only reason people liked them is because they are a-plenty).  a horrible effort.  the only thing worth some merit is that some of the action sequences pack some punch.  other than that, says nothing, does nothing, and isn't worth anything.  not recommended
0790749815|5.0|The scenes are wonderful and suspenseful and each scene sticks in your mind because they are so original.  The UN scene, the Mount Rushmore scene, and of course, the CROP DUSTER scene.  Hitchcock was a genius and I don't understand why films today cannot follow the Master's example.  The acting could've been better, but what do you expect from Cary Grant (who only relied on his looks), however, Eva Marie Saint is wonderful.  She's a great actress, and has a couple tricks up her sleeves in the film.  Hitchcock's cameo is hilarious, tpp.  I love this movie.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best CDs in my collection.  Slipknot seamlessly blends hard rock, heavy metal, rap, punk rock, and electronica into their personal variation of alternative metal.  After I failed to locate the clean version of the CD, I bought the digipak version, and, boy, am I glad I did!    This album kicks off with a creepy, electronica-tinged intro and then blasts off into a hard-hitting metal track entitled &quot;(sic).&quot;  Never before have I heard such intensity and overall catchiness in a heavy metal song.  The music doesn't let up from there.  From &quot;Eyeless&quot; to the hidden track, &quot;Eeyore,&quot; the atmosphere of insanity and chaos is unparallelled by any other bands I know of.       With nine members, the music doesn't sound as muddled as you'd think.  For one thing, the drummer, bassist, guitarists, and vocalists are the only ones consistently playing, I believe.  Every now and then, a few measures will fill with some creepy percussion that hints at some real talent beneath the surface.  The turntables play for most of each song, filling the air with slippery-sounding rhythmic sound effects.  The keyboardist blends so well into the overall sound that I usually can't make out what he's playing.  The drumming and vocals are incredible, the bass playing is decent, and the bludgeoning guitars stay modest for the most part but occasionally slip over to play more complex riffs.    Lyrics-wise, the CD is alright.  I have a slightly different definition of profanity than most people, so I, for one, didn't find this CD too explicit, though most people probably will.  To my mind, explicit language is language speaking of explicit subjects, not using words that some people hold to be explicit to talk about non-explicit things.  The only song on here that I thought was really explicit was &quot;Get This&quot; which is so digusting, lyrically, that I dislike the song.  However, almost every song on here is peppered with words that most people would find profane; the only &quot;clean&quot; tracks on here are 1, 4, 7, 17, and 19.    Overall, this CD is great.  The orchestration of the music is frighteningly complex yet comes off as extremely chaotic.  Like good jazz music, this CD sounds almost like it has been improvised in the recording sessions and but still manages to sound very tight, infectiously catchy, and effectively produced.  I look forward to the next album by these nu-metal rockers!
B00003CXRP|1.0|another overblown tom hanks epic.  zemeckis lost his touch after the back to the futures/roger rabbit and has continued to spiral downwards. If you would like to watch Tom kill fish and talk to a volleyball for nearly two hours, this movie is for you.<br /> The only reason the movie earned 2 stars from me is because I thought that the action sequences on the Fed Ex plane were superb. So, if you know you will like to see Tom kill fish and talk to a volleyball for most of the film, this is for you. <br />P.S.- When I say he talks to a volleyball I mean it. It is another way that he is able to stay alive. His friend &quot;Wilson&quot; is supposedley another strength that keeps him alive.
B000055ZB8|4.0|This version of Nosferatu looks as good as the movie ever will. The color tints are done tastfully, without attracting too much attention to them, the score is both effective, yet subtle and the print quality is the best I've ever seen. Part of the appeal of this film, despite the legendary stories behind the making of the film and its infamous cast, is the fact that people and places don't look the same as they did in 1922.  No amount of makeup, set design, or costume could ever account for 80 years of history. Something about this movie is and has always been simply captivating.
B000006JPJ|4.0|I must say I was disapointed with this one.  I was always being told it was the greatest, yes it is very good, but not what many claim.  Here's what I thought of each song:<br />Moonchild: 4.5/5 Really good song.  I liked it a lot, although some of the lyrics sound really dumb (\\"don't you dare to save your son, and save the young ones\\").<br />Infinite Dreams: 4/5 A nice soft song.  Once again it suffers from the lyrics.<br />Can I Play With Madness: 4.5/5 I just love this song.  The lyrics are great, the guitar is great, the drums great.  It's all just so good!<br />The Evil That Men Do: 5/5 My second favorite song on the album.  Listen to it, it's just one of the best songs ever.<br />Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son: 5/5 God, this is the best song.  One of my all time favorite Maiden songs ever.<br />The Prophecy: 2.5/5 A really bad song for a Maiden song in my opinion.  It just bores me.<br />The Clairvoyent: 4/5 A pretty good song, I like the bass part in the opening most of all.<br />Only The Good Die Young: 4/5 Very solid Maiden song.  Need I say more?<br />Well that's all.  Now that you know all about it, go buy it!
B00001U0E1|1.0|i saw this movie and man seriously it was horrible.  if you have any semblance of good taste, please steer clear of this awful movie.  robbed many other worthy competitors at the Oscars.  the only thing worse would be a sequel.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Cast Away is one of the best movies in 2000 and so much better than &quot;Gladiator&quot; which was so boring. You have to see Cast Away because its a really really excellent movie. So buy the dvd rent it borrow it what ever just see it because its a excellent movie from beginning to end!
B00005B36H|2.0|hello....my name is jack and im probably the biggest Tool fan in Massachusetts and what i have to say may freak the fans of tool to death when i tell them them that this is the a horribly annoying album.....it seems that Maynard had rushed it alittle with his songs that are just plain boring and repetitive.......Although &quot;The Grudge&quot; and Schism&quot; are pretty good songs everything else on that cd is just plain worthless....it kills me to say something like this about my all time favorite band but theres no denying the truth to this one......to all you tool rookie's pick up undertow,Salival and AEnima before you go near this one or this album may scare you away from tool's real talent<br />     thank you and a good night to all
078401213X|1.0|very poorly photographed, directed, written, and acted.  this movie is filled with tons of flawed logic and uninteresting techno thriller moments that make absolutely no sense.  i feel optimistic that this will open the door for better things by aronofsky as requiem for a dream was a notch up the ladder, but definitely steer clear of this overpraised mess
0517123207|5.0|It is often said that Charles Darwin launched the modern science of biology with this book.  Before he published The Origin of Species in 1859, biology was a collection of unrelated facts, much like the state of chemistry before the periodic chart of the elements was worked out.  After its publication, biology became a systematic science with a unifying theory.  <br />To learn more about how Darwin's groundbreaking work led to the amazing growth of biological knowledge in the fourteen decades since its publication, I recommend that you also read British geneticist Steve Jones' new book Darwin's Ghost:  The Origin of Species Updated.
B00003CX5P|1.0|i could hardly make it past 10 minutes of this movie.  the original 3 star wars were bad enough, but this one now adds the fact that they can be pompous because it's 25 years later and they're all rich.  steer clear at all costs<br />the only thing of note are some of the all CGI battle sequences.  everything else is for waste
B00003CXAA|5.0|I'm korean boy. so.. I cannot speake English well..<br />But I think this is the Best..<br />I'm 16 year-old. I born in 1988..<br />This movie made in 1972..<br />I love This movie..  this movie will live in my heart forever..<br />This is the Best! That I've ever seen
B00000K0DT|2.0|very over-blown with tepid writing, direction, and acting.  definitely not oscar-worthy but better than the typical fare of the same genre.  not bad as a rental or a simple movie to pass the time, but all in all it's not very good, original, or groundbreaking
B00003CX5P|3.0|When I saw this movie in theater, I was astonished.  20 years had been erased from my past.  It was the early 80's again.  I was reduced to a gawk-jawed wide-eyed 5 years old.<br />The second time I saw this movie I drew the following conclusions:<br />(For the most part) Good/Great actors performing poorly. Amazing Special Effects with which the actors/extras did not know how to interact (you could tell in many background scenes that the actors did not really know what was going on around them, and did not know how to act with imaginary machines/monsters)<br />Underrated story with some gaping holes (I had to watch it twice to understand exactly what was going on and what Palpatine's design really was (he reminded me of Dudly Smith from LA Confidential.)<br />Great action sequences.  But as great as they were, they could have all been improved by multiple rewrites (preferrably by L. Kasdan and not George Lucas.  Retire the writing table George, retire the directing chair, your vision is great, but your skills are lacking.)<br />Overall, worth watching once, not worth buying on video/DVD The DVD doesn't even have a commentary  which it desperately needs.  Lucas needs to explain himself (if that is possible) to his legion of ex-fanatics turned fanatical critics.<br />(PS: Jake Lloyd was miscast.  I didn't hate him, but he was too young/inexperienced to play such an uncontemporary role.  Interacting with things that he cannot see took it's tole on his performance.  I was expecting to hate Jar-Jar, in his first scene I was uneasy about him, but as the film progressed, to my own astonishment, he grew on me.  By the final droid battle, I was laughing aloud to his bumblings.  He was corny, but so are Ewoks.  Jar-Jar (his horrible name aside) took the bulk of the corniness upon himself.  In any Lucas movie there's bound to be corny humor.  I'd rather it be Jar Jar who expresses it than Liam Neeson.  This movie is drawn out and very light-hearted.  People did not like this.They forget it is just the introduction to the series.  An ideally contrasting setup to the upcoming, dark brooding sequels.)
0679879269|5.0|My reaction to `The Amber Spyglass' was quite surprising for me. I had read `Northern Lights' and `The Subtle Knife' in quick succession when I was 12, and fallen completely in love with them, then over the 3-year wait for `The Amber Spyglass', doing my duty as a teenager, I lost interest in reading in general and in fantasy in particular. Thus despite having been on tenterhooks at the cruel cliffhanger of `The Subtle Knife', by the time the third instalment came out I had neither the money nor the inclination to shell out for the chunky hardback. However about half a year later I had got back into reading in a big way after re-reading `Pride and Prejudice' and enjoying Neil Gaiman's `Neverwhere' (I have quite strange tastes), and as I had book tokens to burn I decided to buy TAS, being a little curious as to what had happened to Lyra and Will. And so it was that a (relatively) jaded 16-year-old girl sat down to read this book, not expecting much. A few chapters later I was curled up in my armchair utterly absorbed, torn between reading more and prolonging it. For the first time since being an 11-year-old bookworm I found myself mourning the fact that I was halfway, two-thirds, three-quarters of the way through. I ended up telling various uncaring, puzzled or annoyed friends in an excited tone that I couldn't work out what Mrs Coulter was doing, or that Lyra and Will were going to find their dæmons. In short, I loved it.<br />About the ending. On my birthday, I reached the end of `Over the hills and far away' (the chapter in which Will and Lyra discover their love) and decided to save the rest for the next week. I was in a happy haze all weekend. Then I took the book home on Monday night and finished it. First of all, I was devastated. I cried myself to sleep. A book has not affected me this much since I read `Jennie' when I was about 10. I hated Philip Pullman with a passion, and I was depressed for a couple of days. I almost wished I had not read it. So if this is how you feel now, I sympathise. However, after a month of reflection, listening to songs like `Merman' and writing bad fanfic, I realised a few things (with the help of fellow fans wiser than myself): firstly, that the ending gives a message that is crucial to the book of taking responsibility and being unselfish; secondly, that Lyra and Will's love for each other will stay strong throughout their lifetimes, which is beautiful; thirdly, that they will discover the other way to travel between the worlds and be together in a way; and lastly, that the mere fact that a book, printed words on paper, can affect people like this is something beautiful and worthwhile in itself, and proves the value of the book rather than negating it.<br />The religion question. I think that the seemingly `anti-religious' themes of `His Dark Materials' could be compared to some of the `anti-religious' music of Tori Amos (`Muhammad My Friend', `God', `Icicle'): both are roundly criticised by fundamentalists, but what they are attacking is not so much the idea of God but the worst aspects of the Christian establishment: hypocrisy, self-righteousness, repression. Perhaps he did go a little over-the-top in his depiction of the Church (it would have been nice to have at least one vaguely sympathetic religious character), but he was trying to make a point. However in the end the religious parallel is not the be-all and end-all of the book, merely the framework for the story.<br />As for Lord Asriel's and Mrs Coulter's supposed turnarounds, I have to say that I was just delighted that the latter finally became an interesting character after being the pantomime villainess of the first two books. Asriel was always a complex character and I don't see why people were surprised at his self-sacrifice. Yes, he was cold and selfish in his way, but selfish with respect to his purpose rather than his own safety. And although there are little inconsistencies in the plot if you are going to pick it apart, most of those referred to here are misunderstandings arising from not reading carefully enough, and the rest are mostly so trivial that they do not stand in the way of the story.<br />Which brings me to my last point. (`Finally!' I hear you cry.) The reason these books are so incredibly good (which may have got lost amongst the criticisms on these pages) is this: their vividness. What this means is that people, places, objects, occurrences, are all described so wonderfully that they all take up a permanent residence inside your head. I really don't know how he does it, but somehow I know how it feels to hold and read the alethiometer and use the knife; I can see Lyra and Will and follow them every step of the way; I can hear Mrs Coulter's voice; I can walk through the world of the dead, and come out into the light and beauty of the world of the mulefa. If you want a book that will absorb you completely, hold you in its grip for as long as you are reading it, and retain that grip for a long time after you have read the last page, then buy the first volume of this wonderful series, curl up in a good squidgy armchair with some chocolate, and enjoy.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|An above average film about a gifted young man from the Bronx who draws inspiration from a reclusive author.<br />There are several elements which could have been overdone in this film: prejudice, class differences, breaking out from poverty, isolation.  But the film is really about the friendship which develops between Jamal and Forrester, and how it changes both of their lives.  Had the film tried to develop everything else, it would have lost this principal focus, and much of its impact.<br />Sean Connery does a masterful job, as always, and Rob Brown as Jamal is a natural.  Anna Paquin is charming, as is the chemistry between her character and Jamal.<br />A bit less sentimental than &quot;Good Will Hunting,&quot; if you liked that film, you will like this one.  If you don't like films that don't have a lot of action, avoid this film.  I have always said that character development makes or breaks a film, and this film develops its characters superbly.<br />The music, though different than you might expect from a typical Hollywood production, is excellent and fits the movie well.  Smoky jazz/blues, moody in some places, playful in others.  I especially liked the jazz guitar rendition of &quot;Somewhere, Over the Rainbow.&quot;<br />A final note:  If you have a DVD player, you might want to try the DVD edition.  The camera work is VERY tight, and my wife and I both felt that a lot of the scenes were being cut off by the &quot;pan and scan.&quot; We found this distracting, so we feel that this movie is probably best viewed &quot;widescreen.&quot;
B00003CX5P|5.0|Dazzling special effects and excellent battles, excellent storyline that excells with speed, and a great original cast. To many fans it was disapointing. What do you expect? No popular saga could ever meet the expectations fans had!! It was good enough for me. Critics put it down saying it is a embarrassment to George Lucas. Why is it that it is selling as good as it has been doing. Number 1 on the list with 3 or 4 months to go till' release. Alot of people like this movie, alot of people don't. Thats with every movie. The average movie watchers say it is good. Critics are just a bunch of buttholes. Whatever anyone says I love this movie. Definitly my number one! Star Wars movie are meant to be seen as a saga, not individual movies, so hold off the Jar Jar arguement till the prequels are completed for goodness sake!!!!

014100018X|4.0|Joanne Harris' Chocolat is a pleasant, enjoyable read, perfect for sitting outside on a sunny day.  The story is not too taxing and the reading is easy.  Vianne Rocher and her young daughter move into a small provincial French town and open a chocolate shop during Lent.  The village priest takes great offense at that and tries in his own way to shut her down.  Vianne befriends the various misfits from town, enriching their lives through her friendship and her chocolate.  The novel is too light to be taken as deep symbolism, but rather is a fairy tale/morality play in which traditional roles are switched.  The Catholic Church, instead of providing salvation, is all emptiness, while the chocolatier asks people to reexamine their lives and in some instances, saves them.  If you tend to get offended by writers poking a little fun at the Catholic Church, this novel will probably offend you.  But if you are looking for a light, enjoyable well-written read which turns expectations upside down, try a little Chocolat.  You won't be disappointed.
0345442989|5.0|This is an excellent book, if you like star wars you will LOVE this. I thought it would be jus about the political issues behind epsisode 1 but not so! It does go a long way to explaining the taxation issue in TPM and palpatines manipulations of people, but it is such an action packed and well written book, i think it may be one of the best SW books i have read. It especially goes into details of the jedi council and how it works and it also explores how the senate works... it is an excellent book and a great read, well worth forking out your hard earned dosh for!
1558216847|5.0|We owe a great debt to Slavomir Rawicz for sharing his remarkable story with us. His escape from the horrible Soviet prison camp in northern Siberia and subsequent trek to freedom is a great tribute to the human spirit to be free. I was especially touched by the bonding of those few other prisoners that joined him in this effort. Although different nationalities, they came together as a cohesive group, determined to get along and reach their goal. What they endured and how they survived is a tale that ranks right up there with the great adventure stories throughout history. This is a welcome addition to any library.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I first heard creed at school where someone else was listing to them on (...) (when nobody knew about it) and it sounded kinda like nirvana but more angry. I went out a week later and bought Human clay. It was suberb - the entire album was excellent and i cannot understand why it only got about 13 in the ablum charts (in the UK) when it should be a classic.<br />The album has 12 songs (or 11 and some bonus tracks depending upon the issue). The first 4 songs are quite heavy, with load, angry a masculine vocals which are suberb for the style - but aren't too loud to fall into the heavy metal category. The riffs are great and you never get bored of them - even after many listenings. The album has some medium and slower songs for the masses such as Wrong way, Higher, With arms wide open, inside us all and Wash away those years (which is perhaps a little cheesy). The songs flow together seamlessly and in a good order, with good contrasts in style (such as slow beginnings to tracks e.g. Faceless man, What if...etc). <br />Overall, a suberb album for people who like metal, rock, or even soft rock to enjoy. One of my favourates and worth every penny. Sell relatives to afford it.
B000002BVN|5.0|I do not see how anyone does not like this album, unless your rthym less, and can't dance then you probably should sit down, and mope.  Because this is the album to move, and shake.  Every song on this album is 5 star quality, and very well produced.  If the songs seem a little long, its cause they are, and generally remixes are for clubs, so don't knock the album based on that.  Everything about this album is so good, Michael's vocals, and crazy beats, without stuttering obniouxs ones.  Every song is sooooooo good, besides MONEY, I just can't get in on this song.  But the best song is THIS TIME AROUND, and 2BAD, because Wyclef Jean really hooks this song up.  And although I can't understand the lyrics of MORPHINE it is without a doubt, and not arguable that this is the #1 song on the album, although not my favorite, it is the best.  THIS TIME AROUND is off the hook!!!!!!!  You have to by this album if you like to dance, but if your looking for something lethargic, and dull don't cop this, cause you won't like it.  This album really shows Michael's growth as an artist.  Ok so now you just got hipped to one of the hottest albums out, go scoop it up.
B00003CXRP|5.0|This was a film I wanted to see only because of Tom Hanks, not because a remake of Robinson Crusoe had any particular appeal. What a surprise! This film has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. It makes The Perfect Storm look precisely like the little boat in a box of water that it was (not to mention paper-thin characters and way too much nonsensical machismo.) The plane crash in Cast Away is so real that the viewer gets a terrifying sense of its actuality. (The only other &quot;wreck&quot; sequence I've seen that was comparable was the train wreck in The Fugitive.)<br />I cannot conceive of any other actor pulling off what Hanks does in this film. He is an actor with such honesty and integrity that he inhabits every character he portrays. And in this case, one cannot help but watch in awe as he invests his formidable skills in this Fedex employee who miraculously survives not only a horrifying plane crash but also a life of total isolation on an unpopulated little island.<br />What's also amazing is that this film was directed by Robert Zemeckis who's not famous for his sensitivity. But this film has it all: utterly believable characters, a fine script, and more action than most bash-em-up, shoot-em-ups could ever manage on their best days. To see a man we come to care about deeply beat the odds and survive makes for the most rewarding viewing. There's not a single predictable moment, nor a single stock character to be found anywhere in this film.<br />Absolutely stunning and highly recommended.
0345350499|5.0|Of love and nurturing, human passion and drama, social taboos and natural desires. An old wisdom is interwoven in this book. I loved the majestic beauty and power of the women evolved in this saga.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|Okay, if you want to read about how great the movie was or how great the music on this soundtrack, find another review.  Don't get me wrong, I think both are excellent, but this soundtrack is MISSING SONGS!!  Where is the opening scene in the dance hall, the mix of Lady Marmalade/Becase We Can/Smells Like Teen Spirit and more?  Where is the &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot; song when they're convincing the duke to endorse the play in the elephant?  Where is Like a Virgin?  The songs on here are okay, but three of the songs that MADE the movie are glaringly absent.  A second soundtrack better be coming soon.
B00004BZ16|2.0|&quot;Sandinista&quot; is in response to a Central American conflict in the late 70's, in which a leftist army overthrew a Democraticic government with ties to America.  The Clash, confirmed Socialists, celebrated the Sandinistan victory with this mammoth telephone directory of oddball songs and political ya-hoo that filled 6 sides of vinyl when first released. The new Sandinistan government fell back into Democratic hands only a few years later and &quot;Sandinista&quot; is as flippant and buoyant as such political conflicts. The Clash are thieves dancing around a campfire outside the circle of victory with the smallest cache. Any political ideology  evaporates into Joe Strummer's weary daydream of what it would be like to be just anybody. There's a sweetness here, the dream of the tired rebel in &quot;Rebel Waltz&quot;, a romantic image of victory that swells into heaven-like bliss, a soulfullness in &quot;Charlie Don't Surf&quot; with a California beach guitar conjuring a gorgeous night-time surf, an immediacy and rhythmic tranquility in &quot;Living in Fame&quot;, a railtrain piercing the fading tracks in &quot;Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)&quot;...  No, I wouldn't be without &quot;Sandinista&quot;, the mesmerizing  ugly sister of &quot;London Calling&quot;. It's like receiving political pamphlets from the sky from a million dollar jet as victory is declared in Ding-dong-ville.
B000002AH7|5.0|This album exemplifies what an extraordinary gifted musician Miles Davis was and, for that matter, Gil Evans too.<br />Miles has always been the first to try on new things in the Jazz scene and with great success. He revolutionized the Cool, the Bebop and indeed later on the electronical Jazz in his own way and stands out as the best.<br />This, however, is not a Jazz album. In fact, it has nothing to do with Jazz. It is a collection of classical pieces, wonderfully orchestrated and very reluctant on the use of jazzy tunes or other modern influences.<br />It is a collection of shining brilliant, sometimes moody, tunes payed by a brilliant Miles. The album should not be compared to other Miles' work but taken on a stand alone basis and be enjoyed when you are in the mood for it.<br />For those who know the country Spain, it brings back memories of the many wonderful and special occassions one has enjoyed there. The use of Castillian and Flamenco elements will transfer you straight to a late night dinner on the beautiful coast or to the old treasures of Madrid.<br />Enjoy!
0783243499|4.0|The film catches the atmosphere of the book very nicely, but it avoids most gruesome details and especially those that are more extreme and shocking. This film wants to give the gist of the book and it is a real success. The hero is a golden boy among other golden boys, but he knows this world is a total illusion, maybe even a lie. The lie of money, easy money and the illusion of the power of this money. His extreme personality makes him look for the most extreme sensations and these can only come from the physical suffering he can impose onto people, either by torturing them or by killing them. This is nothing but a metaphor of the vain and aimless chase for money. Money, the blood of society, is translated into the real blood of other people, and this blood has to run on his hands and face to be really felt, just like money has to run from his hands in the face of other people to express its power. He is a killer because he is unable to limit his power to the sole flow of money which is only a simulacra of the flow of life, and first of all the flow of blood. Hence the character is psychotic. But the metaphor works also the other way and society is psychotic, money is criminal, money making is an uncontroled permanent assassination of the richness of a culture that is always present in his personality. He engulfs himself in music and long dissertations on music when he starts stepping beyond the limit of sanity. So his criminal activities become the realisation of the flow of music, the linguistic flow of his highly intellectual and elaborate commentary on the music. And here is the third metaphorical level : the flow of music and his flow of commentary on the music go along with the flow of blood he criminally causes as a trespassing action beyond the sole flow of money. His wealth of intellectual dissertation on music is the cultural side of his wealth in money and this otherland leads him to bathe in a wealth of blood. Even if the film is not a masterpiece it is a thought raking and prompting adventure, and it is an adventure to enter such a film, because you feel concerned at once by this post-modern psychosis, a psychosis many of us live and try to dominate, even if unaware of it because of our good training and our desire to integrate in society.

B000002GHH|5.0|This was John Hiatt's breakthrough album...not his first in a long shot...but one which took his work in a different direction.  Oh please...you must check this out, especially if you are in your thiries or forties.  Hiatt writes pieces about love, kids, addiction...he writes catchy songs about the little things in life, but they are things that ARE life!!!!  And the other thing about Hiatt is he is so damn clever.  Thing called Love rhymes Amoeba with Queen of Sheba.  In &quot;Your Dad Did&quot; ( a great song about trying to live out of your parents shadow) &quot;a two year old says grace..she says help the starving children to get well...but let my brother's hamster burn in hell.&quot;...And on top of that, Hiatt is an artist who understands heartache(Lipstick Sunrise) and the redemption of love(Have a little faith in me)...  And what a band...Hiatt, Ry Cooder, Nick Lowe and Jim Keltner....Well obviously I recommend this work...in it are the joys and frustrations of living in the world of love....sometimes the call of love is so alarming...but without it we would all be amoeba.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|Years ago Randall &quot;Memphis&quot; Raines (Nicolas Cage) was a legendary car booster.  When he retired and left the Long Beach area auto theft went down fourty seven percent.  His little brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) wants to be just like Randall and takes a job from a mobster who goes by the name of &quot;The Carpenter&quot;.  When Kip fumbles the boost Memphis is forced out of retirement and back into the life he thought he left behind.  Randall then re-assembles his old crew and attempts to steal fifty cars in one night with the cops already on to them.<br />You have to take this movie for what it is.  Yes the dialoge is bad but it was still fun and very entertaining.  What more do you expect from a Bruckhiemer film.  This movie also has a great cast including Angelina Jolie, Delroy Lindo, Will Patton and Robert Duvall.  However they were not used near enough.  The only part I don't like is the jump scene on the bridge.  The DVD has a decent amount on it including several featurettes and a trailer.  The film is presented in widescreen DD 5.1 surround.
B00003CXPD|5.0|My son dressed up like Beauty(Belle from Beauty and The Beast...not the concept of beauty) for halloween.  He dressed like the Mother Superior when we took him to the sing-along Sound Of Music.  The other day he got a superman toy and was putting a Barbie Shoe on it.  I am living in the world of the unique child.And I know there will be a day where someone will try to change my son........ This is why I cried in Billy Elliot......This is a beautiful film about being different in an uncompromising world.  It is a film about economics and society, and how art is developed through frustration and need...but with all that aside it is a truly entertaining and fabulous film.  Stephen Daldry, the reknowned theatre director, makes his debut here.  The direction is the thing that gives this it's guts.  This is a much better film than it needed to be.  And the performances....Julie Walters, Jaime Bell and Gary Lewis(such an amazing performance as the dAd)...Just check this out.  The movie goes places that you don't expect, and thankfully, places you do.  I have just been thinking about the end of the film, and how it is an ugly duckling story...the coolest thing about it is that more than Billy turn into a swan.  It seems like the entire community turns swanish.  Art and individuality can do that.  I was the quasimodo of ducks before my som came along.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Brilliant music by a brilliant guy. He has original and remixed music that will simply blow you away. Moby is simply the most intelligent musician to come around since REM. He holds the listener spellbound with his mixes, his originals and his beat. Simply put, if you want to hear music that is not built for instant Top 40, corporately approved, or tweaked by producers and mixers simply to catch your attention on the radio, Moby is for you. Play it.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|...if that is what it should be called. This album is great, and it is good to hear Bruce singing again with the band he should be in. Blaze was a great singer, it's just that his singing style didn't belong in Iron maiden(With the exception of the X-Factor). The only &quot;bad&quot; song I have heard is 'Ghost of the navigator'. I just don't like. Otherwise it's a great album. The line-up is great. Three of the best guitarist ever on the same album. I am glad that they didn't fire Jannick. He belongs in Iron Maiden with his raw style.      The Best songs on this CD are without a doubt 'The Wicker man', 'Blood Brothers' and 'Out of the Silent Planet'.     This album is not just for Maiden fans that is for sure. My other complaint about this CD is that some of these songs are too long. Like 'Dream of Mirrors', 'The Nomad' and 'The Thin Line Between love and hate'.      Now all I have to do, to like the entire album is to listen to 'Chost of the Navigator'.
0780018664|5.0|An excellent piece of German Expressionism. No wonder the director Lanf made a name for himself. The plot, acting, and setting all hold up well. As a special bonus you get to watch Peter Lorre in a main role before he was steroetyped into villian henchman roles. Add color and the gruesome details and this could run in modern theaters with no problems.
B00000BKDV|4.0|Just two words. Over rated. This is a great album but not as great as you might think. IT has two very weak songs, weak eneough to drag this CD one or two stars. Those songs are 'Quest for fire' the lyrics stink and the music is below Maiden average. And 'Sun and steel' the lyrics are very good but the music it self sucks. The best songs are with out a doubt 'The Trooper', 'Flight of Icarus' and 'Where eagles dare'. The other songs are also very good. But (Other fans will kill me) my personal favorite is 'To Tame A Land'. I dont know  why it's just a good melody. If you are new to Iron Maiden, then buy the following: 'Killers', 'Powerslave' and 'The X-Factor'. Then you'll get a broad sense of what Iron Maiden are cabable of. All feature a different singer. Paul Di'Anno, Bruce Dickinson and Blaze Bayley. And you'll love every one of them. Bayley is an  under rated singer. The so-called Maiden fans should shoot themselves if they say that Bayley is a bad singer.
078062369X|1.0|I collect Vampire movies but this was dreadful. It features Snipes at his most shallow and contrived. He bacically plays a flat lawnmowe style vampire killer. He literally walks into rooms ful of vampires and mows them down. Yawn. As far as action films this ranks with such stale bashers as Demolishman.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Cameron Crowe wrote and directed &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, which is fitting since it is largely about his own beginnings. Cameron was the youngest writer for Rolling Stone magazine and, as a teenage journalist, he followed numerous bands as they went on tour. In this film, these bands are rolled up into a four-man group called Stillwater. These guys get my vote for the best band that never was. Since I was just out of kindergarten when the story was set, you should forgive me for thinking, after my first viewing, that Stillwater was an authentic recreation of some famous group from the early 70's. The realism is that perfect!<br />But this movie is not about a band, at least not predominantly. It is a  coming of age story. A young man raised in an unusual household, with an unusual mother, is taking his first steps to adulthood. The interesting thing is that his first steps are so large as to stretch past most people's entire careers. Through a combination of talent, luck and timing, young William Miller, played perfectly by Patrick Fugit, is recruited by Rolling Stone magazine to write an article on Stillwater. This strange occurrence actually makes sense when you watch the film despite sounding ridiculous as I write it.<br />If William goes through dramatic changes in a short time, his mother is a rock of stability. Elaine Miller is able to &quot;freak out&quot; most people, with a few choice words but to her son, she is home, safety, love and in a way... imprisonment. She is very intense but caring and it is this combination which drives her eighteen year old daughter to a life of airline stewardship. We can see Elaine's true courage however, when she agrees to let the fifteen year old William go &quot;on the road&quot; with a drug taking,  womanizing rock band. This, after we have seen her characterize Simon and Garfuncle as &quot;stoned&quot; and forbidden their music from her house.<br />One of the most important people William comes into contact with, on his journey, is Penny Lane. She is a beautiful, glowing, perfectly permed young dryad who follows the bands and has a following of her own. Adamant that she is not a groupie, Penny has created a concept called &quot;Band Aids.&quot; Her subscribers refrain from sex with the performers in an effort to more truly embrace the pure experience. She talks a good game but in the end, she's just a young woman in love. The object of her affection is Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist and Zen-master for Stillwater. Her situation is complicated after William falls in love with her, at first sight.<br />Thus Alice enters Wonderland and many an adventure is had. Despite William's best intentions and the good advice of his mentor, Lester Bangs, the band manages to seduce him. His plan, to get in and out before missing a test, is soon discarded in the face of a larger than life rock and roll experience. There is one truly touching scene where the band, (and company), is riding their bus to the next gig and singing along to &quot;Tiny Dancer.&quot; William leans over to Penny and says, &quot;I have to go home!&quot; To which she replies, with a magical pass of her hand, &quot;You are home.&quot; That says it all.<br />There are several contrasting character changes happening during the film.  One stands out more than most. William starts his professional career as a fan, loving the band, the music and the whole lifestyle. As the tour progresses and his eyes are opened, he becomes, not jaded but more worldly, professional and wise. Conversely, Penny Lane is introduced to us as the epitome of sophistication. She is young but knowing, and handles William as an older sister might. As the film progresses we discover that Penny is not so all knowing as she seemed. She is just as fragile and naively hopeful as any other girl her age. In the end, it is William that has to send her a reality check.<br />Everything about this film is fascinating. The music is just wonderful, with Billy Crudupand Jason Lee bringing authenticity to every performance. The band's interpersonal dynamic is almost a character of its own. This climaxes during the famous plane crash scare, when each confesses their deepest secrets to the unrestrained laughter of the audience. William, his Mother and Penny are all unforgettable creations. Crowe is a wonderful writer, so good in fact, that I am disappointed he didn't turn this story into a book. Watching the movie will just have to be enough, for now.rudup and Jason Lee bringing authenticity to every performance. The band's interpersonal dynamic is almost a character of its own.

0671578642|4.0|This episode (the second) in the Honor Harrington series, introduces us to the Grayson planet and society. I find this author's imagination both interesting and thought provoking (not to diminish any action drama for you action addicts). <br />This Grayson society will make you think regardless of you own belief structure. Being a &quot;heathen&quot; I enjoyed the idea of &quot;God the Tester&quot;.<br />Honor's character continues to evolve through out this series and does so in this episode along with others collected along the way. We also are introduced to some Peep characters which we will find in other stories of this space saga.<br />I have read reviews of David Weber criticizing this series covers.  While I tend to agree that the covers could make readers wonder if this is a typical &quot;cheesy&quot; work, let me unequivocally state that this author is incapable of cheese (write your complaints to the editor, not the author).<br />For all those &quot;wantabescientist - like me (my expertise is in embedded software)&quot; this author takes the time and (no small amount) of effort to define his science in this universe.  For me I respect that in a Sci-Fi author.<br />In summery (in case you haven't noticed) I enjoy reading this author and this series and would have rated this as 4 1/2 stars if it was available (five if I already did not know there are better to follow).
