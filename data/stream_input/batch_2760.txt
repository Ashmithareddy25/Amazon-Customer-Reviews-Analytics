B009WUBERW|4.0|It was a good watch to just sit back and watch the action.  Too many references to other movies they've been in -- the one liners got old.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|...but the later films are &#34;almost&#34; enjoyable.  My wife and I saw the first two when we were dating and I really didn't enjoy them.  I evaded the other movies until this came out and got sucked into watching her marathon of the movies prior to this release.  It pains me to admit that I didn't hate it.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|i don't like this movie very much, the cheesy 3D effects make it look lame, and the monkey is creepy, and the casting is weird
B00COO2D6O|5.0|I have been impressed with this game. It is easy to get started, and can become addictive. Worth $1.99, and your time to download.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|very cute and entertaining movie; would definitely recommend it to people with younger children, although we do not have such little ones, we did enjoy it
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed the book and the movie was very true to the book. It is well acted, well staged. Good special effects, especially the clothing that appears to be on fire.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|we really enjoyed watching this movie; disney never ceases to entertain and at the same time tell a good meaningful story
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Kubrick at his finest. Lee Emory the D.I. that everybody remembers from boot.  Closest thing to war without the fallout.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|we ended up throwing this in the trash because it had some sort of paper thing in the middle of the disc that should not have been there, and if you tried to take it off, it left a very sticky residue.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is such a fun game.  My wife and kids couldn't stop playing it.  Everyone wants to be the one to solve the puzzle.

B00DL47ORO|3.0|Killer whales have often been referred to as docile yet extremely intelligent and friendly creatures, but Gabriela Cowperthwaite's documentary \\"Blackfish\\" puts a bit of a different spin on it. While Orcas may be friendly out in the wild, they're also extremely family oriented meaning that one killer whale can't be ripped from its natural habitat or its pack and be placed in a concrete pool with a bunch of other strange killer whales and be considered a family or be expected to perform for our amusement without any sort of backlash. \\"Blackfish\\" takes a look at what the possible psychological effects of what happens when an Orca is taken from its family at a young age and mistreated nearly its entire life.<br /><br />\\"Blackfish\\" mostly follows a killer whale named Tilikum who was captured at a young age back in 1983 in the North Atlantic. While you learn about Tilikum's upbringing, \\"Blackfish\\" also shines light on how shady SeaWorld operates as several former trainers speak out about how life threatening it is working with such massive creatures that the human species still doesn't fully understand.<br /><br />You'd think that becoming an animal trainer would require a marine biology degree of some kind or intense training. Most of these trainers were hired at a very young age, pulled off the street, and trained by SeaWorld. Meanwhile, Tilikum is sent to Sealand; a water park that is basically unfit for its killer whales. Basically a pool with a concrete barrier where the whales are stored in a steel box at night, Sealand is the type of run down water park that is just waiting for an incident to occur for it to be shut down. That incident occurred in February of 1991 when part-time trainer Keltie Byrne fell into the water and Tilikum ripped her apart in front of an audience.<br /><br />With each incident that occurs, whether it's a trainer getting injured or killed while being in the tank with a killer whale, SeaWorld sweeps the event under the rug while usually blaming it on the trainer and claiming that the animal isn't aggressive. One of the most devoted and safe trainers from SeaWorld, Dawn Brancheau, died in 2010 while trying to get Tilikum to perform. The SeaWorld employees lie about the facts of killer whales to the general public while the killer whales are often attacked by the other whales in the tank. When a killer whale is used to traveling 100 miles in a day and is just crammed into a small pool and forced to mingle with other whales it doesn't know something is bound to give. \\"Blackfish\\" reveals that there were whale hunts back in the early 70s where divers would steal and capture baby Orcas.<br /><br />Killer whales are a fascinating species. They're extremely intelligent, each family of whales seems to have their own distinct language, and they're just majestic and magnificent to watch. Mistreating them over such a long period of time, especially when their lifespan is nearly equivalent with a human (females can live to be 100 while males usually only live to be 50 or 60) is sure to cause some sort of psychological damage. Seeing so many people get injured in \\"Blackfish\\" is horrifying and hearing about the ones who died is devastating.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that \\"Blackfish\\" mentions SeaWorld refusing to partake in any interviews for the film because it would have been a welcome change of pace to hear their side of the story. Documentaries tend to shed light on one side of their subject just to get their message across. While it does make sense, it also feels overly influenced. The viewer is going to walk away feeling bad about the way killer whales are treated in captivity and hating SeaWorld, but how else can you view something like this if only one side of an argument is made with no one to really debate the matter?<br /><br />While \\"Blackfish\\" is extremely informative it also reveals a little too much at times. Realizing killer whales have a cleft in their brain that humans don't have at all is intriguing. Hearing that Tilikum is the largest whale in captivity and that his semen is invaluable because of it is also interesting. But actually showing trainers extracting Tilikum's milky business just felt all kinds of wrong. Imagine scratching a pink, fleshy tree branch while holding a giant Ziploc bag full of condensed milk at the end of it and you have a pretty good idea of what went down. It's practically bestiality territory and the point was made with what was said in interviews. Showing it to you will just make you want to take back to back showers while scrubbing your eyes with steel wool and dousing them with bleach.<br /><br />There's obviously something worth investigating when it comes to killer whale handling at SeaWorld and how they're handled in captivity. \\"Blackfish\\" reveals that humans are to blame for the way they've lashed out at water parks, which is more than likely true. While the documentary isn't exactly riveting, it is thought-provoking and leaves you with the urge to admire nature in its natural habitat rather than in a contained environment.g.

B004LZFWJO|4.0|I like to.play.this game anytime I'm stuck waiting in a doctor's office or waiting on someone who hasn't arrived yet.  There's no wrong way to do it and it's fun for the kids as well.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really the best I have found. The graphics are good and there is slot to do. Very realistic also. I think most people who love animals would enjoy this game.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|As a Chicagoan, I enjoy seeing Chicago politics played out as it really happens. Backroom deals with long term outlooks on benefits, grudges swallowed hard and nail biting decisions made at the last minute when &#34;you know what&#34; hits the fan. Also, I love that they insert recent headlines in just about every episode. I love every minute of it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this game, a while back. I absolutely positively love it. it is highly addictive,  and fun for all ages. I strongly reccomend this application
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Sorry for the lame ass title, but I had to!<br />This movie was good and I did enjoy myself. This film is not for the people that like boy-scout type superheros, since this film has a very dark edge to it sprinkled with humor. There is blood, there is violence and there is action and I cannot wait to the second installment coming soon.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Mostly fun.<br />Would recommend. A friend told me to try it, and I'm glad she did. Had a lot of fun solving the rooms.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|Sorry for the cheesy title. I bought this action figure while having huge anticipation for the new &#34;Man of Steel&#34; film of 2013. Being a big Superman fan, I knew I had to have this for collectables sake. I'm sure it makes an excellent toy for any child so I would recommend this if you are in fact looking for a gift for a Superman fan or any kid.

B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I mostly enjoy this game but it is extremely difficult for me.  I stay on each level forever.  I think I am on 74 at the moment.  I am never sure of what I am doing  - feel very stupid at times.  I wish you had some kind of general directions.  I know other people have problems, but then a lot of people whiz right by me, so I think I have a lack of comprehension.  I enjoy games in general, but this one really has me baffled
B00B8M4IMK|2.0|I have been using the product for about a week. I have been struggling as to whether I should give it two or three stars.  I decided on two stars because I do not believe my workaround will work in the long term.  Since the metal contacts on this device do not have any &#34;play&#34;, or spring behind them,  the tip can become disengaged from the bottom of the car outlet due to vibration caused by car movement. As a result, the charger will stop working. I resolve the issue by periodically checking if my phone is in charging status (unsafe  to do while driving).  If I see the phone is no longer charging, I grind the plug into the outlet until the phone indicates it is receiving a charge.  I would not advise buying this product.

1423140605|4.0|This is the third book in the Heroes of Olympus series by Riordan.  As with all of Riordan's book he follows his normal formula.  The story is well done and entertaining; although with all the different characters we are following now things get a bit drawn out.<br /><br />I listened to this on audiobook and, like the previous two audiobooks in this series,  this one was very well done.  The narrator does a good job of keeping all of the voices straight...and there are a ton of voices to keep straight.<br /><br />Finally the two groups of Demi-gods meet.  The meeting results in our group of heroes, basically the groups from the first two books, joining forces and journeying to Rome to confront some giants.  Additionally Annabeth is told by her mother Athena to follow the Mark of Athena, which also takes them to Rome....but leads Annabeth on a solo quest.  The fight against Gaia continues.<br /><br />Great continuation of this series.  There is a lot of action and adventure and some great monsters just like in previous books.  We even get to meet Hercules/Heracles.  This story follows the same formula as previous ones...the heroes leave on a desperate quest to save the world, then find out they only have seven days to complete their mission.  They fight monsters, journey, fight tougher monsters, journey, and then fight the big baddie at the end.<br /><br />The story gets a bit drawn out because it's following seven different characters and we hear from all of their different points of view.  It's just a lot of characters to try and stay engaged with.  It ends up making for a long story.  The characters are pretty easy to distinguish between; Riordan has done a good job of giving them all outstanding characteristics.<br /><br />Despite the multitude of characters the story never gets confusing though and moves at a fast pace.  The majority of the story is about these characters learning each others secrets and learning to trust each other.  Of course they are also trying to prevent Gaia from ending the world.<br /><br />My favorite part was Annabeth's solo quest to follow the Mark of Athena, I love her character and she confronts some truly creepy things.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this book and found it entertaining.  These books are formulaic but also fast-paced and engaging.  I look forward to the Doors of Hades when it comes out later this fall.  Recommended to those who enjoy fantasy/adventure reads...or who have enjoyed previous Riordan books.ing to prevent Gaia from ending the world.<br /><br />My favorite part was Annabeth's solo quest to follow the Mark of Athena, I love her character and she confronts some truly creepy things.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this book and found it entertaining.

B00466HN72|5.0|My son selected this movie to show at his birthday party.  We had an outdoor movie night planned.  We had a huge crowd of kids and parents.  Kids ranged in age from 3 - 70.  This was a great pick and appealed to all ages.  I was really surprised how good this movie was.  I would recommend to anyone with a broad audience to appeal to.  I really thought the 10 year olds ( most of the attendees ) would lose interest.  However they were engaged throughout the entire movie.  Very cute, fun, upbeat, clean movie.

B00CFYD682|5.0|There is something utterly mesmerizing about 'the minutes'. A breath of fresh air.<br />When I got my signed copy I sat and listened intently...it is a great achievement.<br />I do feel at times it's a tad overdone/heavy handed with Sigsworth's 'signature'.<br />Don't get me wrong--it's a fantastic collaboration, I just wish a bit more subtle on Guy's end and a bit more Moyet.<br />It could just be that I have a strong preference toward the less noisy and subtle; although I do love the 'cinematic sweeps' and the different feel of these songs.<br />There are parts of every song that are pure perfection and some perfect all the way through.<br />And as always, her voice and lyrics are amazing. Just amazing.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00CFYD682 the minutes]]

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I can't believe I purchased the 3rd book in this series.  i will NOT be purchasing the 4th.  The entire book is about this couple having sex.  There is no plot whatsoever.  Just sex, sex and more sex to the point of being ridiculous.  The feelings the narrator has for Cross are completely unrealistic. The man is rich and apparently can have sex on cue.  That's all there is to him.  She has what is probably a very interesting past as does her roommate, but we never delve into this.  I've read paranormal romances that were more realistic.  It is really a rip off of 50 Shades of Gray, but not nearly as good.

1451695195|4.0|This was a good book.  The medical information was interesting to me, as I work in the medical field.  What wasnt new to me was the doctors revelations during his NDE.  I am by far non-religious or spirtiual.  I am a non-practicing Catholic.  Yet everything the good doctor experienced during his NDE, was all explained to me as a child growing up Catholic, going to parochial school for 8 yrs. Everything that Dr Alexander experienced was taught to me during Catechism, by priests at church and the nuns that taught school. Maybe thats why I found his experience, while moving and certainly life changing, all so obvious and familiar.  I guess that I was surprised to discover that after all these years, I still felt the same way about my religion, that even though I dont practice what I had been taught so long ago, the concepts and belief is still there.  Maybe all that indoctrination during elementary school worked!  I wonder if any other readers who had religious schooling noticed the same thing.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I have yet to meet a fan of this show who isn't passionately into it and wants to talk about it.  I have never cared so much about a TV show.  For those who haven't tried it, it is not about zombies; it's about the people.  The writers have created such a compelling story with characters you feel strongly about, on many levels.  You struggle through the moral dilemmas with them, wondering what you would or should do in this new world where &#34;right&#34; and &#34;wrong&#34; has been turned upside down.  The characters develop so differently in response to all the things they go through; you wonder what might emerge in yourself, qualities or demons that lie dormant because there is no need in an orderly world.<br /><br />Each season is so different because life would be constantly changing as you adapt over time.  New viewers must start from the beginning to appreciate the evolution of the characters and their situation.<br /><br />Only the best writers could make so many care so much, and the actors are fantastic in bringing it all to life.  Just a phenomenal show!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Not, I repeat, NOT a knock-off of Terry Pratchett's &#34;Hogfather,&#34; but a different story branching off from a similar premise,  The scenery design for the Easter Bunny's burrow and (Russian but nicer than Black Peter) Kick A** Santa's North Pole digs show some respect to the pre-Christian cultures that originated those archetypes.  Although the giant scowling stone Easter eggs might be a nod to Easter Island too :)

B00E66QPCG|5.0|I've been searching for another trading strategy that would help me find trends and came across this book. At first I didn't know what to expect, after all, maybe the \\"Simple Strategy\\" was going to be too simple and more hype than anything. After getting into the book I realized that although simple, this strategy was well thought out and was covered with dozens of examples.<br /><br />The one thing I liked about this book is the fact that the author gets straight to the point. There's no fluff or any filler material, just straightforward content.<br /><br />About the strategy:I started doing some backtesting and am pleased with what I see. I'll start trading on a simulated account next week and will let you know how it goes.<br /><br />Overall this book is very well written and easy to follow. It's a good choice for beginners and intermediate traders who are looking for (another) day trading strategy.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00821PCJS|1.0|This series is a cheap and dark remake of the old stories of the 1950's that deals with world domination lizards. This lizards  never make it, in spite of their superiority.

B00D28TNT6|4.0|When Amazon's shopping advisor popped-up with &#34;We recommend Slow Focus F_ _k Buttons because you like Boards of Canada&#34;, I froze. Boards of Canada was music, but SloFoFuBu read more like a video camera attachment for home porn. I blinked, then read further.<br /><br />Well, Amazon got it right, I do like BoC, and several reviewers claimed likewise. And they all loved F_ _k Buttons (and Slow Focus in particular). Next I did something rare: I bought the CD without previewing a single track.<br /><br />IT ARRIVED TODAY and I listened through the distractions of work. This music is way-heavier than BoC. And edgy. And a keeper. I'm about to buy a copy for my son then, later, I'm going to grab a pair of Bose 'phones and listen again, without distractions. There's lots I missed, maybe a chance to earn a 5th star.

1583334386|5.0|When I told people what book I was reading, they quickly chalked it up to another self-help or fad-dieting book.  This is simply not the case.  McGonigal explains everything you ever wondered about why you struggle with certain behaviors through scientific studies, experiments and examples.  This information this book shares about how certain habits/behaviors can wreak havoc on your self-control/willpower is fascinating.  After reading this book I clearly understand the biological reasons behind why I craved sweets and tended to binge on these food items when I lacked sleep, for example.  I recommend this book to anyone who struggles with any sort of behaviors, addictions, habits, etc. that is holding you back from living a full life.  Reading is of course one thing, putting the experiments and working towards changing your thought patterns and habits is what sets you free. If you're open, curious or just fed-up with where you are now, it's well worth a peak.

B005CMSDKA|5.0|HANNA is a good action thriller starring Saoirse Ronan from ATONEMENT in the title role. The film begins with her hunting a reindeer in wintry Finland. She feels guilty about her arrow missing her prey's heart allowing it to suffer a slow death and quickly finishes off the job with a gun. (Spoiler Alert - This scene will be repeated at the end but you can see it coming a minute before.) We watch her performing her martial arts skills with her father Eric Bana who's also responsible for her encyclopedic education. Hanna is no ordinary teenager with her extraordinary survival skills as she seems like someone from another world, and we slowly learn why these two have been in hiding for years.<br /><br />Meanwhile they become hunted by Cate Blanchett as a nasty CIA boss who knows the secret of Hanna's origin and forced them into hiding for years. Hanna and Dad separate to meet in Germany as now it's their turn to be the hunters of Cate who takes her role to heart as the Queen of Mean: Part Wicked Witch, part Ma Barker. You will enjoy this chilling performance probably more than the other two leads but that's not to undervalue them because villains always have the showiest parts. This is a balanced trio of good actors meeting the demands of the script: The father as teacher, the student who surpasses the teacher, and the principal who closed their 'school' and wants to eliminate them. Cate's henchmen are as nasty as her if not worse.<br /><br />There's a fairy tale motif running through this survival story as well as plenty of action scenes of mortal combat, chases, and torture accompanied by a throbbing score by the Chemical Brothers. The secondary theme concerns the emotional awakening of a young teenaged girl who has been raised away from civilization and must now learn to interact with adults and a girl of her own age as well as with boys as Hanna discovers when she tags along with an English family in Morocco on her covert trek to Germany. Saoirse is convincing here as in her action scenes. It's these blending of genres and themes that makes HANNA a cut above the usual action thriller. Saoirse will amaze you in how she uses her expressionless face to mask her true feelings and Cate will give you a good scare in just about every one of her scenes.<br /><br />This Blu-ray's visuals are very good in depicting the various locales and times of day but it's the DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack that surpasses them in quality to give your home theater's speakers and subwoofer a total workout with room shaking ability and startling surround effects. Dialogue is crisp and clear.as in her action scenes. It's these blending of genres and themes that makes HANNA a cut above the usual action thriller.

B00ATP24SW|5.0|It took a few listens to really like this cd, but I'm glad I bought it.<br /><br />The new drummer adds a new demension by being  more varied, instead of the typical double bass drumming found on power metal (and too many Stratovarius recording) that has become cliched and even iritating.<br /><br />IF you won't pay excessive, get the version that adds 4 bonus tracks, they are just as good or even better as the 11 tracks on the normal version

B00AHHODH2|4.0|An interesting romp in a neighborhood chock full of characters with a secret or two carefully hidden.  Makes you wonder what will happen next.
B000EZIJKO|4.0|Reaching that time in life where I spend more time reflecting on the past than planning for the future.  With that said, I have begun searching for some classic books from my childhood for our library.  Needless to say, Charlie and Chocolate Factory would be included.  I found an original that I had hoped would make a nice addition and ordered from Amazon.  The particular selection was received less than desirable condition.  However, to my excitement in finding the book, I acted on impulse and ordered it.  The book actually arrived just as the seller listed it.  When I explained to the seller my dissatisfaction (to no error of the listed description); they refunded my account. Although I had not requested they do so, I do appreciate the effort and great business dealing with the public.  I would recommend ordering from this seller as I will look for them as well on future book purchases.<br /><br />thank you The Shire Bookstore
B004T0XYM8|5.0|This is by far one of the best westerns I've seen to date, and it amazes me how many westerns will &#34;borrow&#34; ideas, themes, scenes, copy how scenes are edited, music, and so much more from this movie.  But what can I say? If you're going to &#34;borrow,&#34; you might as well &#34;borrow,&#34; from the best, and &#34;Once Upon a Time in the West&#34; is one of the best, if not the best.<br /><br />There is very good acting in this movie, the actors do a damn fine job to help tell the story.  The movie is shot beautifully.  Every shot captures the harsh beauty of the old old west. The direction of this film is top notch.<br /><br />Overall, you're not going to be disappointed by this movie.  If your a fan of westerns, you must own this movie, if you're a fan of movies, you must own this movie.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This show is amazing, they should have been able to continue...the book series is a hit, why not the show?
B0063M22QO|5.0|Mind testing fun. Easy to use. Visually appealing. Nice to play alone trying to kill some time. Keeps kids busy too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super fun stuff! I like the challenge, it really makes you think. Wish there were more levels with this free app.
B00932AA5G|5.0|This was a compelling film that grabs you from the opening scene and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Excellent acting, great action, interesting twists and turns.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I use these to augment my recording studio engineering and mastering. They are little heavy on the low frequency but sound remarkable.
1451626096|3.0|I must say that basically I found \\"The White Princess\\" tedious.  I knew from her previous work that Gregory despised Margaret Beaufort.  She does sound like the an evil woman hiding behind her piety.  But I did not know that, in addition, Gregory has no love for either of the Henry Tudors. To me her portrayal of Henry VII is warped beyond reason.  She paints Elizabeth of York as a powerless pawn making her a bit of a bore in the process. This is the type of book that you finish because it is not painful to read and you keep hoping it will get better. It doesn't.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Good Show.  Liked the twists the storyline presented.  Catherine Zeta Jones is a total knockout.  I'd see this movie again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Awesome game i play this game alot and i really like it you should download it like seriously serious lol
B00DP3IESY|5.0|This is I think one of those shows that just did catch on while it was in the theaters. I was not able to go an see it there but wanted too.  So for me picking it up on instant video at Amazon was a good deal. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The style and way Harvey handles everything is superb. Must watch series for me. Series on repeat for last week.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome book! Lots of shocking surprises. Loved it, cant wait to read the second book. She really knows how to keep a reading reading
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|We saw this movie in the theaters and could not wait till it came on bluray.  Usually we buy our movies from a big box store but they did not have the 3D version in stock.  I went to Amazon on my phone and bought it from the parking lot.  2 Days later the movie arrived and we enjoyed it
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|My four year old grandson loves this movie. His  twenty month old sister likes it too. She runs around buzzing like a bee after it has been on.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow, what an awesome story. It reminds me of Nicholas Sparks stories. I can't wait to keep reading through the series!
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Get this DVD and watch it!! It was truly amazing and you won't be disappointed!  2 hours of pure entertainment and an incredible visual spectacle.  I love Madonna and loved this show. Can't wait to get it!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I ordered this for my husband for Father's Day and he loved it, BUT.. if only this came with Prometheus for a reasonable price! Had to purchase separately because the one that did come with it, also had a high price tag.
B00947N6UG|5.0|It is by far, the favorite animation film my daughter watches.  She would watch it multiple times, and the good part about it is her friends all love it too, so when her friends are over, we can play it as well.  Jack Frost being &#34;fun&#34; seems to resonate with this upcoming generation (ages 7-8).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Friend me please my user is pinkplusblue. &lt;-----like that(no period)also this game is really fun it just needs to lower the prices for more horses!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoy ordering books on line, I can read it on my kindle, computer or my smart phone.  It is real handy to be able to read it any where I am, and there is no waiting for it to come in the mail or go pick it up.
B002361MLA|5.0|It's exactly what I need at this time in my life :) ! I will recomend this book to all my friends !
B009WO7NQO|4.0|provides great entertainment and passes the time....good spin off of regular game..keep up the good work and the updates do not effect on 4s
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|I liked the concept; and the photography and acting were superb. The story was rather dull and slow. I got the feeling this was made to honor many of the great talented singers and musicians of the 20th century who may otherwise be forgotten. For that reason, it was interesting to me to see these great talents in the background and to research them in google for their contributions.
1439136653|4.0|This was a fun book to read, like a favourite children's book with a mystery at its centre, but with serious social themes. Vikas Swarup is clearly a profound thinker. His book, which I read much before the movie came out, depicts the horrific things that can happen to a poor orphan in a country like India, and the hope that underpins many Indians - that miracles can happen.<br /><br />It is an uplifting read, an honest book, and it deserves the merit it has received.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nemo' s Reef is a great game to clam down with. I would relax with daily as it's rewards with preals how sweet.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Man I knew it was idea to get this game man shoot this what I'm talking to u about but I still think Mario is better.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I LOVE IT !!! I can't wait for 'Expendables 12', when this cast of Geezers go flying through the air in their 'jet-propelled' wheelchairs and rockers sporting 'Hellfire missiles' and 'Minigun' platforms!<br />Come on, Stallone ... didn't any of these guys save or invest enough of their preposterous paychecks to retire gracefully on?<br />Quit dragging these Geezers out of the grave to populate your fantastically absurd scripts with. They only serve to amplify your 'slackjawed-scrotum-dragging' mentality for the mundane.<br />But, I do have a hint: Take yourself and this cast and 'fade to nothingness' with whatever little dignity you have left. Your audience has . . . . . .
B00CH87HF4|5.0|awesome game getting really addicted to it. the gameplay is amazing and the feel of it just pulls you in even in the intro.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|No interruptions, no lags and excellent streaming clarity! It was a joy to watch in the comfort of our own home.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Please add unlimited time and this game would be the best game in the appstore beside that this is incredibly awsome game i would recommend it
B005HS00ZU|5.0|Just a brilliant set of reworkings of his songs. It's, as he puts it, a lot of &#34;miserable white man tunes,&#34; but if you're a fan of Gabriel already that shouldn't be a problem. The older the fan, the better probably; not much Steam or Big Shot type stuff here (although the arrangement on Digging in the Dirt is great). Highlights for me were San Jacinto, Lou Reed's Power of the Heart, Paul Simon's Boy in the Bubble, and Rhythm of the Heat. The 3D is pretty cool but nonessential.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|I absolutely loved this series!  I didn't catch this when it was on television but I devoured all seasons of it once it moved online!  Loved it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of my favorites....you learn so much history in the process of viewing the show!  And I always hated history, now I love it!
B005H5H3LW|4.0|This grew out of a cartoon series (I hesitate to call it anime) that I used to watch when I was a kid called &#34;Star Blazers&#34;.  I always thought it would make an interesting live action movie.  I have to admit that I bought this more for my &#34;geek cred&#34; collection than anything else, but it was definitely entertaining.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Reputable product, used this brand for years, excellent value.<br />Very satisfied with purchase this vendor has been recorded for future  purchases.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I haven't completely read the book, however, I find this perspective extremely interesting--if you're spiritually in tune with the Almighty.
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|This is an interesting story that is well acted on screen but beware:  violence shown.  Colin Farrell is very real and the story is satisfying.  Action is tight.  I thought this was a pretty good movie not sure why it didn't get more press.  A worthy watch.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Once I  got into the book,which took awhile I couldn't stop reading. The characters are realistic without being depressing.  This was a fun summer escape.
0689829590|1.0|What the hell is the point of a board book if it has paper fold outs?<br /><br />I loved this book as a kid, and I bought it with the intention to give it to my soon-to-be-born-nephew. I was extremely disappointed when it looked like the book had been shrunk and cut from real paper to put on the board book, especially the pages with fold-outs. The paper on these foldouts was so flimsy that mine didn't even make it through the creation process without being torn. The great awesome image of the moon popping out of the book was torn right down the middle. Now no, I'm not saying every book comes like that with the tear, but the fact that this is a book on board should mean it's durable, not that it can get torn by just looking at it.  I returned it and I'm gonna get a paper one instead when he's a little older, it's just not worth having a board book that looks like all the other board books when this one can't be handled by a toddler.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book really helps with the foundation of how you really feel about money and how money is to work for you.
0064431622|2.0|I haven't put this in front of a kid, but the creature that the chameleon becomes is quite creepy. The message of the book is fine, but I think it would have worked better if it went in reverse then removing said parts of other animals, instead of just jumping immediately back to itself. I also think the message is going to go right over young one's heads.
B008X9Z3UC|3.0|I was a bit disappointed by this product.  It is stylish, sleek, and quite beautiful .....  but as far as function is concerned it just doesn't quite do it for me.  There are no outer pockets.  What??  I kept looking for the pockets.  Why are there not any pockets?  Where do you put your other things?  Huh?  I don't get it.  So this is a Kindle Pouch.  And that said....  it is a  VERY WELL PADDED pouch, and I know that my Kindle will be fine if I drop it......  But why no pockets?  Or pouches?  And this product only zips open on three sides.<br /><br />That said....  My older Kindle Case has numerous pockets.  First, it has a separate leather pouch on the inside (left side) that you can slide the USB charging cable under to store.  On the inside (right side) there are 4 tabs that you can slide your Kindle into that actually hold the Kindle \\"inside\\" and won't allow it to slip out.  There is also an outside zippered small pocket that you can put something into as well.  So, a lot more thought and practicality went into the Marware Kindle Case.  I am not sure if Marware makes a case for the Kindle Fire HD yet, but if it did and had pockets that is what I will get.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very nice, sleek sleeve to store your Kindle this is great.<br /><br />If you are looking for pockets... don't be deceived.. there aren't any.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My son mentioned to me that this is a show that he thought that I would enjoy. The first day I watched 3 episodes, the next day I watched 6, and so on. I have now watched all of season 1 and season 2. I can hardly wait for season 3 to start. Every episode is filled with unexpected twists and turns with the final twist leaving me on the edge of my seat and wanting more. The content also makes me wonder just how much is based on truth. What is the CIA really up to on a daily basis?
0345803485|1.0|I thought it was going to be exciting and a page turner. It turned out to be a dry, boring, romance novel. It was not interesting and definitely did not make me want to run out and buy the second book. No, thank you.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|I love the REACHER tales, my favourite books but Tom CRUISE just ruined the image of Jack REACHER for me, sorry Mr CHILD but you should never of let this happen.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The update has finally allowed me to connect to Facebook using the Kindle For HD, but still has some problems. None of my friends that I already know are on the game are not appearing and it is not letting me connect to the weekly contest. Despite the few drawbacks it is an entertaining game!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Love it, sounds great!  I loved this movie and could not wait for this cd to jam to it in my car!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|this is an app I have been waiting for a long time and it doesn't dissappoint. it has everything from deck set up to two headed giant gameplay. if you love magic the gathering this is the app for you.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Fun app. Its okay, but not for someone looking for a hardcore music tool. I'm only surprised that it made FAotD twice...
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is the coolest music making app I have ever c used, do I would recommend grabbing out today while its free
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I am finding this a very easy way to record the mileage I drive as a caregiver.  I am also using it for my appointments, etc.
B0061S0A64|3.0|Purchased this several months ago as the free app of the day. I guess Amazon ran out of apps...<br /><br />Over all it is a decent app for playing around with music.
0385536828|4.0|All this author's books are very different. I enjoyed it, partly because of memories of the period in which it was set (England, 1972). It's not meant to be a thriller so might disappoint some people looking for one.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Fun game but not loading after this recent update on kindle fire hd.....very frustrating! I even deleted from device and cloud and downloaded again, what a shame.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app to take notes, create notebooks for them, and share my notes. I think it is a great app to use. I really haven't cared about the permissions, but it is a great app to take notes on and write with.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Really enjoyed this CD. Great songs. Never miss with Andrea. Highly recommend for Andrea Boocelli fan. Makes great music for lovers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You really need to download this game right now for multiple reasons cant list them all. All you need to know is this app is AWESOME
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|On my own, I probably wouldn't watch this, but if you need something to watch with a teen or pre-teen...then this is pretty good. This movie isn't nearly as clever as it likes to think it is, but it is decently entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a lot of fun and very funny.And they added a course from<br />Disposable me 2 it is cool.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is useful, easy to use, and tells you just how quickly your Kindle Fire is running out of juice! It is invaluable when trying to eek out the battery to the next time you can charge your device.
B0097C8XL0|3.0|This is fun to game to play but on your first turn it freezes. Then it freezes when you get a high score its not good to play so don't get this game.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|My whole family loves this movie. The quality is fantastic regarding the robots appearances throughout and in the end you find yourself really rooting during the fight!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first heard about this game alot of my friends were playing it. I looked into the Amazon store and found this game.this is the best game ever.This game is awesome,fun,and exciting.
B005GSZZ1A|2.0|You could read thr prologue and not bother with the rest. It just kept repeating the same stuff over and over
B00594XOZU|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME perfection but the only thing is it doesnt really update on a kindle fire....they need to get that checked
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book, all the way through, very few dull moments. Only thing is there's not much intrigue as to what will follow in the next book
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A wonderful fictional account of life in North Korea. Good character development and an intriguing plot with many unexpected turns.
B00BGGIW2K|5.0|A comment on the review by 'THE HEADPHONE TRANSMISSIONS'.  The criticism was essentially a description a common enough phenomenon known a sibilance.  In modern recordings sibilance is a rare event.  Producers are generally more savvy about this.  A difficulty here is my speculation that the recording was done digitally, where shrillness is not uncommon.  Changing media gives the engineer/producer another trip to the well to EQ the shrillness or sibilance out.  My copy doesn't display this problem.<br /><br />Another feature that may be in play is that \\"most\\" sibilance in vinyl is the result of insufficient zeal in cartridge set up.<br /><br />Additionally, I am disquieted somewhat about the moniker including the term \\"headphones\\".  I don't use 'em myself and am not qualified to comment past that.  The quality of the system and set up (including wire) affect vinyl reproduction profoundly.<br /><br />My $.02.
B00D9CDTUY|5.0|I only saw the extended cut and re-watched with the voiceover filmmakers' commentary so I will not be reviewing the theatrical version.  The standard technology at the time of this viewing is in Blu-Ray and I won't waste your time with the description of the technology or presentation differences. The DVD I watched comes with the standard extras (more than most DVD's) and unless you do something the standard coming attractions.<br /><br />Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is being pointed out as a mole (Russian sleeper agent) with a mission. This accusation automatically condemns her husband to death. So Evelyn must go rogue to save her husband and prove her innocence. Yes I know this story is been done before but never as well acted.<br /><br />Will Evelyn be able to track down the culprits before she is dispatched by her own people? And it appears that she still has a good friend on the inside; at least someone willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and that is fellow agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber).<br /><br />The film has plenty of action, lots of great background music, and veteran actors that do not overwhelm their character's personalities. You may be able to guess the plot, guess the twists, and guess the outcome as they did not go out of the way to mask these two well. But who cares it's a lot of fun watching the individual characters trying to figure this out for themselves.<br /><br />Watch Angelina Jolie play a similar role as an insider that wants out in \\"Wanted\\" (2008).
B00280LYHS|5.0|Rick Giordano has out done himself in this book .read it and you will under stand<br /><br />Caroline putman kid of Athena
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a wondrous world Erin Morgenstern has created. An enchanting world to visit with prose that reads effortlessly. I savored the book over several days, willing myself to take my time so as not to have to leave that world too quickly.
B006UN3MRO|5.0|I love Paddington! His adventures are really quite funny. Great series all around for any age. Quick and easy read
B009LMTDL0|5.0|If you want to hear from a courageous business woman, willing to say what most of us are thinking but not saying, read this book!  It is insightful, and entertaining.  I found the numerous references to a variety of studies throughout the book very interesting.  I highly recommend this book to women, men, and even high school kids deciding on their futures.
0385349947|5.0|I would recommend the book for any woman and in particular those of us with daughters.  Not only is it a good gut check on our own behaviors but also making a conscious decision to help our daughters navigate their behaviors.  I thought the book was well written and a nice balance of research, personal experiences and just overall good suggestions for success.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great time. I've played other games like this where you run and collect points, but what's better than running a minion!? I LOVE those little guys!!
B008OJ8BM8|3.0|good mix but 9.0 is much better and seems to flow better and rock harder but not bad and worth the buy
B0067TQQI8|5.0|It's small and light and charges my phone (samsung galaxy S4) quickly-about 2 hrs from 40% to 100%. I've done this 4 times without recharging the Anker battery- it should do more but I haven't tested that yet.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I LIKED  EVERY THING: THE DRIVING THE MOTORCYCLES,  THE CARS,  I LIKE GANGSTAR VEGAS  MORE THAN THE GANGSTAR RIO. IN GANGSTAR RIO YOU CAN DRIVE A BUS  RIGHT NEAR THE TRAIN PARKING LOT RIGHT NEAR ANGEL'S APARTMENT. IF YOU TAKE A RIGHT FROM ANGEL'S APARTMENT YOU WOULD SEE A PARKING LOT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU WOULD SEE A BUS YOU MAY HAVE TO DO SOME MISSIONS.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|This is a great action film. Denzel and Chris have a great chemistry together. A great suspense film without blood and Gore. Loved it. Product arrived as described and quickly.
0452295548|5.0|Seldom does anyone come back from such an experience; and we it says much about the brain and its workings.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|Love this movie. Though I imagine it is probably not an exact story of Fanny Brice's life, the story was well told, beautifully acted and the music was wonderful.<br /><br />A pleasure to watch over and over,<br /><br />nelirosi
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book has been a real motivation to me...after reading it I feel I can also do it! I learned lots of useful tips and kind of vanished my doubt bout going the traditional or the self-publishing way...thank you, John!
0803730470|5.0|A story of a mouse walking through the forest, and the creative way that he makes up a monster (The Gruffalo) to protect him from animals who would want to eat him.<br />My grandson love this character.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I used to have numerous sleep apps. Once I was able to get this one, this is all I need. Tons of sounds for whatever you need. Ability to change volumes on each sound to blend. Plus it has a few very unique presets that seem to help when i'm having trouble dreaming or staying  in a deep sleep. Perfect for traveling or when you can't turn your brain off. I use it every single night. An absolute godsend. Two thumbs up! A definite must have!
140006922X|1.0|The author has proven himself a liar in his resume' and may claim to be Muslim but is not! His lack of truth in his life reflects the same in his book.
0545586178|4.0|Katniss feels like a piece being used in every way now that she is in the public eye so often. She finds out that things are never really what they appear to be and learns so much about other districts in this book. I would say more but don't want to give any spoilers at all. I enjoyed the story, but goodness there is a lot of nudity throughout this book and that bothers me since I know if they ever make movies for it, I won't enjoy it because of the content. (I wrote this review a few years ago and am just posting it on amazon. . .I know the movie now is being made as I type this updated review). This was my least favorite from the series, but I know many people who say this is their favorite of them.  It seemed at times like a slight repeat of the first story but we learn even more about what is going on.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|It's not what I expected.  Maybe reading the book spoils it a little.  I loved the other 3, but something is missing in this one.
0439023513|5.0|This was the best book from the series. Although I was figuring out what might have happened (and did happen) with the ending, I was unsure if these things would happen. I read each chapter anticipating the outcome. I read the book pretty quickly because I could hardly put it down. It extends the story we learn from the first two books but is in a completely different type of light with such new situations and circumstances! I was thoroughly entertained. I'm very satisfied with this series. It was so interesting and I didn't really want to even read these books at first when told about it after the first book's release.<br /><br />In case you are wondering what this book deals with, everyone has some type of task they are set out to do.  Ultimately something has to be done about President Snow.  Katniss of course is the symbol of freedom to so many people.  She wants something more. She is trying to figure so many things out.  How can she help the people she cares about and the people from the districts?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I'm a big fan of this game, just don't play it at bedtime... no telling how many nights I've gotten in bed, exhausted, and ended up playing this game for an hour...
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Well, I ordered the Chromecast the day I read the announcement about it, and it arrived a day after the gift code for 3 months of Netflix (which I didn't know about when I placed the order, but it was a good marketing idea and, if I wasn't already seeking a way to link TV & my new One piece Windows 8 computer [which lacks an HDMI port], would have sold me).<br /><br />It literally took five minutes to get up and running (only because I didn't push it far enough into the HDMI socket, LOL).<br /><br />I tried it with HULU from the Chrome browser on my PC.  Those who use HULU know it can be spotty over wireless connections, so some problems were expected.  What I didn't expect was a one second or more delay between browser and TV images -- not that you'd normally be watching both.  It is nice to be able to watch &#34;web only&#34; programs on the TV -- but you cannot &#34;full screen&#34; and still use the computer.  It would be nice if, somehow, the transmission source could be &#34;second screened&#34;, maybe it can ... I'll need to experiment.<br /><br />The real annoyance  is that the Chromecast doesn't work with a KINDLE HD as the source.  The app download says no device, so refuses to download the app to the KINDLE HD.<br /><br />For those interested in hardware, the Chromecast comes with USB power wire to connect to computer, plus they provide a plug in adapter for direct from outlet (which is better -- with Kindle the plugin is an extra, here it's just provided); they also provide a HDMI extender/adapter -- so fishing for the HDMI slot on the TV is a one time effort and you can shift from Chromecast to HDMI cable (as with my ROKU box) without being annoyed and fumbling around.  Thus, both of these show the designers were really thoughtful and the company marketers made it a nice touch ... now if it would only work with a KINDLE HD...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is the best game I have ever played . it's every every every fun to play .it's addicting to play I play it over and over again
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|This item was purchased for the fact that I live in Florida and love being in the water or in my boat. I do a lot of fishing and snorkeling so this filter comes in handy.  Great product!
B004S4LAAS|5.0|His stories keep my interest going from start to finish. I just dont want to put the book down. Riveting
B005LAII80|2.0|I remember the original and thought it might be at least somewhat like it.  Not even close.  Very little humor.  Lots of action and blood, but way more than needed. I think they were trying to overcompensate for the terrible script.  I felt I wasted my money on this DVD and I had even bought the 3D version.  I felt like throwing it away after watching it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I give YouVersion of the Bible top billing because it offers so much... different versions, easy comparisons, Contains lessons, planners to shed light on any dilemma you are dealing with. You can connect with others with similar interests/concerns. Even send a quick blessing to someone in need, even for no reason. Nice way to let someone know you care and are thinking of them. Pray together over the miles, or next door or the next cube... I like... a lot! Has saved me many a day. Quick access. Quick relief!
B009MO5G90|4.0|I like the Resident Evil storyline and enjoyed this film in the series as much as the past two films.  The 3D version of the disc is excellent!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I can only LOVE the quick access that expands my understanding.. I love it because it's one of many of the keys to growth...
B008R14YBK|5.0|My daughter loves this CD, she listens to it everyday.  I liked the price of the CD and haven't found it in local stores yet.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I never rate movies but it is that bad! Most of the characters are different.  The only worthwhile scene was the ninja fighting on the mountain.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I liked this game, and the price was right for an hour of fun.  I just wished there was more.  The price was right for what there was and it kept me entertained the whole way through.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The story moved along very well but the characters were not developed sufficiently to be truly believable. Good but not great.
B00CHS31DG|1.0|Played this and the one called legacy from the same company on my phone at the same time. They both registered different &quot;ghosts&quot; at differnrent times and recorded different words at different times. Ifbit were real wouldnt they both show the same thing at the same time....plus from these two apps you would think I have many ghosts following me around everywhere constantly talking to me in nonesensical one word comminicatons. Hmph
B00E193Y36|5.0|I am a true metal head with a unquenchable taste for heavy. The more I hear from this band the more I love them. With this album Five Finger Death Punch has topped themselves! The Wrong Side of Heaven you Right Side of Hell has already become one of my all time favorite albums! If you can't handle your music hard and heavy punch yourself in the face and buy a Bieber album. If you are a fellow metal head then buy this immediately and prepare yourself for the trip it's going to take you on!
1416596097|4.0|A great read. Le Carre at his best. It's not Smiley or Magnus Pym, it's not The Honourable School Boy, it's post 9/11 and the intelligence agencies are after terrorists, those that harbour them and the networks and hubs that are associated with them. There isn't black and white, only shades of grey and ninety five percent good means that the other five percent is enough for the agencies to get their villain. The intelligence agencies reckon that the 'good' people should just stay right out of the way and let them do their job. After all, that's what they do for a living and they do know what they're doing, right?! Also, lets be reminded that those individuals within the agencies who try to take a moral high will only get in the way too. So do your job, stay objective to the task at hand and don't get all soft hearted, okay!!? Illegal immigration, terrorism and extraordinary rendition are important issues and you better let the agencies lead the way because they're the experts, aren't they?! (Okay, it doesn't matter that they squabble and bicker amongst themselves and argue over information sharing, argue over who's turf is who's and who has got rights over who. It doesn't matter or does it?) And, of course, there isn't any room for tenderness, sympathy or compassion, is there? They reckon they have a job to do and sometimes it isn't always pleasant dealing with a dark murky underside of humanity, but someone's got to do it. Besides the ends justify's the means, right? All that matters is that they get their crook because humanity will be better for it. It's a pacy thriller illustrating the casualty of terrorism- that decent people suffer and can become damaged goods.  A sad, yet powerful story about what the world has become today.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Ordered my Chromecast on July 24th, while it was temporarily out of stock but before the Netflix promotion expired. Just received it this afternoon.<br /><br />For some background, I'm pretty used to setting up Rokus, Apple TVs, and HDMI/MHL cables for getting content off mobile devices and onto big screens. Generally, it's a bit of a pain; logging into services with a remote control is a chore, and getting the cables to actually display the full screen of a device onto a television is hit-and-miss.<br /><br />Setting up the Chromecast, on the other hand, was thirty seconds of downloading the Chromecast app onto my Galaxy Note 2, then maybe two minutes of actual configuration from the phone. Easiest setup I've ever seen for a streaming device like this. Within five minutes, I was already streaming Netflix and Youtube to my living room television.<br /><br />So far, Netflix has been fine. I'm on a pretty slow connection out here in rural Illinois (1.5Mbps down, ick), so the picture does get pretty pixelated, but that's purely because of my own Internet connection. Took it to a friend's apartment in-town and the picture quality is just as good as any other device in the house.<br /><br />Youtube's been a bit shakier, though, because of my connection. Whereas Netflix will adjust the picture quality, Youtube doesn't seem to do that when casting (I lose the option to turn off HD); therefore I get a lot of buffering. Once again, on a modern Internet connection, there wasn't any issues whatsoever.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to try the Chrome tab casting yet or the local media playback, but I'll update this review when I do. I also didn't have my iPad or my Chromebook available, so there's some other things I'll add later.<br /><br />But, for now, it's great at the tasks it's expected to do, and I can only imagine that the third-party support is going to get even better.<br /><br />For Android and iOS users wanting to get Netflix and Youtube on the big screen in theeasiest way possible, and you don't already have something that can do that this seamlessly (I hate smart TV interfaces), get a $35 Chromecast. And, if you need that extra functionality, I highly recommend waiting. They've built it; now, the support will come.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've seen others saying that the Chromecast can be powered via the HDMI ports on some TVs, specifically televisions with HDMI 1.4 ports. I didn't find this to be the case. I have also not seen anyone else that has said their Chromecast could be powered by their HDMI port, only people claiming it is possible -- so this thing might require USB power regardless of your television, if that's a deal-breaker for you then take note. I didn't find the power-supply an issue though, as my television has a USB port that I was able to use to power the Chromecast.  (Edit: from the comments below, it looks like some TVs can power the device with HDMI alone. I can confirm, however, that it will *not* work with all HDMI 1.4 ports, as my television has HDMI 1.4 and Chromecast requires USB power)<br /><br />If you plan to use the device for tab-streaming: your mileage may vary. I found that the quality of tab streaming was acceptable when my Chromecast had a strong wifi reception and I was using my Mid 2012 Macbook Air. When using my Mid 2010 Macbook pro or when I had a poor wifi connection, the quality of tab-streaming was unacceptable. Keep in mind that this thing is going to be connected behind your television, so it's already going to have poor wifi reception because of the interference. They include the mini HDMI extension to help improve the wifi problems, but it doesn't help much. I really wish that the wifi built into the device were of higher quality.<br /><br />My primary use-case is Netflix. Netflix works great. The experience is close to perfect on iOS and Android devices. I've tested it on my Nexus 4 and my iPad 2, and both apps allow me to designate that I want to watch content on my Chromecast *before* I start playing it. I can even switch devices, Nexus 4 to iPad2, or vise-versa and control the show that I have in progress from the other device.<br /><br />The Netflix experience from their website, however, is a major step down. In order to play content on the Chromecast, you first need to start playing the content locally -- this means the content needs to buffer twice. Netflix's website does not recognize that I've already got something streaming on my Chromecast, so if I've started content on my Nexus 4 or iPad, there's no way for me to control that content from the Netflix website (you can do the opposite, however). Hopefully this is something that Netflix fixes, and isn't really a knock against the Chromecast itself, except to say that your experience will only be as good as the support from the provider integrated with Chromecast -- and overall, Netflix does a pretty good job.<br /><br />YouTube buffers a lot. At first I thought there might be something wrong with my device -- and then I remembered that YouTube buffers a lot when I view it on the web too. All in all, YouTube is a pretty horrible experience for anything longer than a 3-minute clip -- and how often am I going to cast a 3-minute clip to my television?<br /><br />I am a developer. I've started playing with the Chromecast SDK. The potential power of this device is amazing. I've managed to create a slide deck that displays on my Chromecast that I can control via my computer -- but that's definitely on the lower-end of the possibilities with this device. I'm not the only one developing for Chromecast, both Pandora and HBO have apps in the work, and I look forward to seeing them work with this device soon.<br /><br />Finally and this last one is more of a wishlist item: Google has been rumored to be working on a streaming television service. I see the Chromecast as the perfect platform for their ambitions, and I hope this is the route they take. Imagine that your cable-box is the Chromecast, and your TV guide / DVR lives in the cloud and you access it from your device. Want to watch content on one of the TV channels offered via Google's service? Just click the cast button next to that channel in the guide and the channel begins streaming live to your television.
B003I55BIA|4.0|Well it's a very different  YA romance from gangs to family problems to stereotypes to cheaters to everything you went through when u were in high school. I recommend it, plus no cliffhanger.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|The characters in this book are so likable. I felt like part of the story immediately and devoured this book quickly. So many twists and turns I didn't think that anything would work out.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I for first time was left hanging. I did enjoy but something was missing. THIS is the first one I can say this of all her books. WORTH THE READ don't get me wrong. I felt left hanging to to much that happened at the end. Just how there will be another one not just on her but what happened princess of Scotland
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Picked this book up about 3 weeks ago and it i a great tool. It has made me a believer in less is more. Thanks a lot.
0345525558|3.0|It was ok, good theme, learned a lot about flowers. But it lacked more action, more emotion. But more action in the next one and more romance.
B005N1E8A4|5.0|Les Folies is only out-shadowed by The Showgirl Tour.  It ranks as one of Kylie's best productions in my book.  The sets and the theme carry the entire show - not to mention Kylie's flawless voice.<br /><br />The 3D is impeccable!<br /><br />The only issue that I found was that the 3D disc was labeled as the regular Blu-Ray and the Blu-Ray was labeled as the 3D disc.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Never wrote a review before, however after paying and downloading I discovered it does not appear to work. Hey Jeff, can I get my money back anytime soon?
B004NXYSI0|5.0|Of all Radiohead albums, this one, the shortest one, is their best. I can't wait to hear their next one. TKOL is better than In Rainbows. In Rainbows is better than Hail To The Thief.<br />I own two of each album by Radiohead. One is the \\"original\\" packaging - now scratched and used the most. The second is either the \\"collector's\\" or \\"limited\\" edition, etc. With The King of Limbs, i thought that i would try the import \\"Blu Spec CD\\" from Japan and see if this is any better than the normal cd. The artwork is awesome and it appears that they provide the lyrics for each song, but in Japanese. But the artwork is cool. The CD itself looks the same. So far, I have not been able to hear any difference between the original and the Blu Spec CD - not that it was advertised as being better sounding. I will be comparing my new Blu Spec CD with the original to see if maybe there is a little difference. So I'll update this review if i find that there is a difference. It is not a remaster. So don't buy this Blu Spec CD if you are looking for better sound. But definitely buy this album! It is for sure Radiohead's best album so far!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|my wife loved it , she is a huge fan of the show.The set is actually boxed very nicely and it does come with the movie
B001AKTZOQ|4.0|This Album is a perfect example of why I shudder whenever I see the term \\"Bonus Tracks.\\" Let's face it there is usually a good reason why those tracks were never released before... they really aren't good at all. (Though sometimes it was just a lack of space. Two Albums that I can think of that had genuine bonuses were Stanley Turrentine's \\"Cherry\\" and Joe Cocker's \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen.\\") And what a pain it is to have to navigate around them when you listen to the rest of the Album, which contains some really great music.<br />Still they are not bad enough to NOT buy the CD, just be aware that you will have some skipping to do if you want to enjoy it.<br />(Also, it comes in a cardboard case. Which is just plain cheap.)
B005723JSQ|5.0|Super funny couldn't put it down! Love Sophie & her fun & witty writing! Recommend for a good beach read! :)
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I could not put the book down I would definitely recommend both books Something Borrowed and Something Blue read them one,after the other I did not like Darcy she was a user and manipulator until she got pregnant and felt totally alone then she came to realize who she really was and true love prevails in the end I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance novel or who has lost a friend that  some friendships will never end no matter what time, events and distance may desperate y ou
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|I like this album. It's classic Paramore. However, there are more slow songs than I would like.  I bought this when it was $5.99. A great value!!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game was genuinely fun, but there weren't enough rooms. It occupied my time, but it wasn't enough to keep me busy.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|Trying something new??? This is the music for you.  Has a wide range of differences in style.  Worth the money
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So cool how the game was updated its awesome I love how the people have different outfits what sucks is that it costs so much nobody is going to get 40 keys or a couple thousand coins
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Very talented.  Has a great range in music and instruments.  Leaves me with a good feeling about life and experiences.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|This game is a fake it doesnt even do anything its an I spy  game dont buy it it's FAKE
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Fantastic story  I read it in  a week.  Couldn't put the book down.  Good mystery with a twist at the end.
034580709X|2.0|This was an awkward mystery for me to read because it seemed like the author was trying too hard to add depth and complexity and only made it rather stilted and confusing.  Much of the book is simply not very believable, such as a Norwegian policeman coming to Australia and carrying a concealed weapon and getting so stupendously drunk that he gets into very violent confrontations.  An awkward love interest ends in a convenient but not very believable way.  I haven't read any other of this author's books but I do hope they are better than this.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|This movie has the heart and soul of the book. which is what's important here. Since I know it's impossible to turn a 600+ page book into a 2 hour long movie, I gave it an open mind as I watched it. It's a good interpretation of the book to the screen.<br />Why have others complained? They don't know how hard it is to take a book and create a screen play.<br /><br />In my life(62 years) only 2 books have been completely translated to film. meaning word for word.  I.E whats in the book is in the film.<br />Hammer films &#34; The vampire lovers&#34; from &#34;exerts of Camilla&#34; and Paramount Pictures  &#34;In Harms way&#34; from &#34;Harms Way&#34;.<br /><br />George D.
B00C061HZY|5.0|A very &#34;human&#34; work from two robots :^) . A mix of funk/disco with lots of &#34;real&#34; instruments and a fresh sound that doesn't annoy you in the very least (something that would be somehow expected in these times of absurd sound compression and volume). Simply terrific.
B00594XOZU|5.0|If my phone's dead, it makes it an easier way to reach my friends and on a larger screen! I love it!
B00E193TM2|2.0|The worst thing you could possibly say about anything is to call it uninteresting.  And all I can say about these guys is that they sound like Nickelback trying to channel Pantera.  For metal that's truly heavy, I'll go to Holy Grail.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is my favorite game I could play it all day it is very interesting I have nothing bad to say about this game I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00BEIYMIS|1.0|Ed and Lorraine Warren have a long-standing reputation of being paranormal researchers. Their reports inspired The Amityville Horror back in 1976. That story was debunked, and the Warrens ended up being exposed as frauds. But that didn't matter - they kept going and making up other stories, which were also disproved. But there are still a lot of gullible people that want to believe Hollywood has discovered scary truths that no scientist or news organization ever found, so the movies keep coming.<br /><br />The Conjuring is supposed to be based on one of their scariest cases, about the Perron family. The movie is &#34;based on a true story&#34; because the Perron family is real and they said their house was haunted. But that's it. Both the movie and the Perron family's story were proved to be completely false. More than that, the current owners of the real house are suing Warner Bros. and director James Wan, for making up a story that is bringing curious people to trespass on their property.<br /><br />It makes sense that the movie is completely false, because it's also completely bad. There is an endless list of things wrong with this movie, but if you've seen it, here are nine of the sillier things to consider (of course, there are spoilers).<br /><br />Nine Things About the Movie &#34;The Conjuring&#34;<br /><br />1. Nothing ever really happens. Nobody is killed, nobody is seriously injured. The dog is found dead in the yard, and a few birds hit the house, but that's it. Up until the last 20 minutes, the movie is all clapping, matches, banging, and yanking body parts. The only thing that makes the movie scary is the sound editing - which is awesome, I must admit.<br /><br />2. The story doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's about Bathsheba, a witch in Salem that sacrificed her kid to Satan and cursed anyone that tried to take her land. Then, over the last few hundred years, Bathsheba's ghost would possess people that move onto her land and make them kill their kids. And now that the Perrons have moved into the house, Bathsheba targets them.<br /><br />Umm, what? There were no actual Satanic witches in Salem, and ghosts don't possess people. And if the Perrons moved, then they would be off Bathsheba's land. Problem solved. Roll credits.<br /><br />3. If all it takes to show evidence of ghosts and demons is a UV light, stoned college kids would have proven the existence of ghosts a long time ago.<br /><br />4. Anyway, Bathsheba is a ghost protecting her land in the name of Satan or something. Carolyn actually thinks of the solution - just move. But not so fast. The Warrens tell Carolyn that moving won't help, because Bathsheba has attached itself to the family. Then the funniest quote of the movie happens. Ed says, &#34;Sometimes when you get haunted, it’s like stepping on gum. You take it with you.&#34;<br /><br />Yeah, because gum abuses you in your house at night, and you can't ever get rid of it.<br /><br />But again, ummm... what? If Bathsheba is protecting her property, why would she leave it to follow a family? Then she would miss the next people to move into her house.<br /><br />However, to prove the Warrens right, Bathsheba figures out where the Warrens live and goes to their house to threaten their daughter. Oh, and she can also apparently control the weather and make birds commit suicide.<br /><br />5. If Bathsheba can control physical objects, why does she just squeeze and pull body parts? Speaking of which, when Bathsheba is dragging the girl around by the hair, and somebody chases her with scissors and cuts her hair so she can be free, why doesn't Bathsheba just grab more hair and keep pulling? How is that an escape?<br /><br />6. Once the family figures out that weird and potentially dangerous things are going on, why doesn't anybody ever think about all sleeping in the same room? Why does everybody still go to their own bedrooms every night so they can get terrorized again, until the Warrens show up?<br /><br />7. When Bathsheba finally decides to actually possess Carolyn, she doesn't do it at the house. She follows the family to a hotel, and then possesses Carolyn, so that she can drive the kids back to the house to kill them. Which just happens to give the Warrens enough time to also get back to the house.<br /><br />8. When Possessed Carolyn is tied to the chair, and the exorcism really pisses Bathsheba off, what does she do? Kill Carolyn? Throw objects at the other characters? No, she turns the chair upside down so that Carolyn is sitting on the ceiling, until Ed tells her to stop it. That's all.<br /><br />Again, I must say... umm, what?<br /><br />9. The point is made over and over that the only thing that can save them is a Catholic exorcism. But when they do the exorcism, it doesn't work. God can't save Carolyn. Only her memories of a day at the beach can drive out the centuries-old satanic demon/witch/ghost.<br /><br />The only thing that the movie is good for is a meta-game. Your goal is to count how many other horror movies are referenced or copied in this one, and how many times each movie is referenced or copied. Hint: it's a lot.<br /><br />After watching the movie a second time, I have a suspicion that director James Wan and writers Chad and Carey Hayes used the movie to play a joke on people. You see, the term &#34;conjuring&#34; has two meanings. The first is to call up or command a spirit. The second definition is something that looks magic but is actually fake. Several times in the movie, the Warrens mention that a lot of people don't believe their stories. And remember, the girl kept getting her leg pulled. Literally.<br /><br />Perhaps the movie was made bad on purpose, to make fun of people who believe this trash. It's a patchwork quilt of random parts taken from other movies with no thought given to the actual story. It was a cynical cash grab, and James Wan made the right bet. It was a monster hit that spawned a sequel based on another Warren case, the &#34;Enfield poltergeist&#34;... which was also a hoax., and then possesses Carolyn, so that she can drive the kids back to the house to kill them. Which just happens to give the Warrens enough time to also get back to the house.   8. When Possessed Carolyn is tied to the chair, and the exorcism really pisses Bathsheba off, what does she do?

B00338QENI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I found the story of Henrietta and her family fascinating. It was a different time when her cells were harvested, but the medical advances made from her cells was truly miraculous. Lots of lessons to be learned from this gripping story.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love how much fun I have with this app! Its keeps my family, friends, and I all having a blast. i highly recommend this app, plus its free!
B0013D8LOU|5.0|We bought my daughter Sweeney Todd as a gift.  She has been entranced by the music and used a piece of it for an audition...a piece of Worst pies in London, and she did very well.  Of course she loves the different roles J Depp plays.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|I'm not a big reader of books but got to the point where I almost couldn't put it down. I enjoyed how the overall story was separated into individual stories.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I have read this book, The Secret, so many times that the pages are falling out.  I have learned about the Secret over to years ago and I have used its teachings in every aspect of my life.  People often ask me how I can be so positive about everything and all I really tell them is that &#34;the Universe is giving me exactly what I am asking for&#34;, then I share the book with them.<br /><br />I have now downloaded it to my Kindle Fire so that I can take it every where with me.  I love it and share it with everyone I meet.<br /><br />Thank you
B005C6HGSG|5.0|I love supernatural so it was great to hear bobbys side  of the story for once it was really cool!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I've watched this movie three times now and could not get off my seat every time I put it on. It's plot is a bit thin but the acting and progress of the film is paced very well and the movie looks and sounds amazing. There's a love story but some action as well. I would definitely recommend anyone to buy if they have the least bit of interest in it. Tom Cruise played the role very good. I could feel the immersion in this film. Not so much from Morgan Freeman but he's not a big part of the movie. There's some really awesome sound effects that made me smile and the soundtrack is unbelievable. Wish I would have seen it at the theaters. You end the movie thinking it was good but it sticks with you. You'll watch it again paying attention to details.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Great read.  Highlights how we get ourselves in such messes.  He points out journals strong tool for help. Take a peek ....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, actually, I've never written a review of a public forum, but...<br /><br />I just finished this AMAZING book literally minutes ago and had to get something down in print. I'm a reader. I love to read and have read many many books, this has to be at the top of my list as one of the most amazing books I've ever read. Books, for me, have the ability to completely change/alter my outlook on life. This book just did that. It was so well written, characters were well developed, I fell in love with them.<br /><br />The summary says grab a box of tissues, and that's no joke. I laughed, I sobbed, I feel like such a mixed bag of emotions I don't even know how to explain it. All I can say is this is a book I will recommend to everyone and anyone and one I will re-read over and over.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is my second read of this book. I've read \\"Outlander\\" three times and \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\" twice, and I will continue to re-read books four through seven in anticipation of \\"In My Own Hearts Blood\\" in the spring of 2014.<br />The joy of reading again allows me to pick up on little items relating to the overall story that I missed out on the first time  simply not realizing at first read the future relevance.<br />I've never felt drawn to fictional characters like this before. Diana Gabaldon's writing style and skill is surpassed by<br />none.<br />Most enjoyable and quite addicting!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun, but there is lots of extra things in the game that need to download, and it took forever and froze my kindle many times.

B005544TRQ|5.0|My cousin who is a lawyer introducted me to this show and after watching the first episode I was hooked.  The performance by each character is extraordinary and the chemistry between them is superb.  Love the New York setting of the show!
B000002GXJ|5.0|This CD is a must-have for every Eagles fan! Recommend it to any classic rock fan. And if you have never heard the Eagles before, this is a good CD to start with.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This Amazon branded dSLR backpack is well worth it and has stood the test of rigorous use. As an event photographer, I'm often running and with the ability to use the chest strap available on this backpack I have no issue taking off on a moment's notice. Plenty of storage for 3 small to mid-size lenses or one or two larger lenses. I was able to store 10 Canon t2i batteries, a Zoom H4n, 6-10 SD/HC/XC cards, a white balance card, a light meter, lens cloth and pen, a few USB thumb drives, and my iPod.<br /><br />All in all, the protection is there, the storage is there for someone looking for their second bag as they begin to acquire more equipment. Depending on how fast you are buying new gear will dictate when you'll want to shift up in size/price of your camera backpack. Currently I am in a predicament in that I am about to get my first L Series glass, 24-105mm, but probably will be unable to fit it in my current bag.<br /><br />So the search begins<br /><br />To end, the AmazonBasics Backpack is worth the try, similiar bags are much more spendy so if you're especially looking to save money, you won't go wrong with this AmazonBasics backpack.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|As a Bible believing Christian I felt the beauty of heaven was lost in his lengthy explanation.  I stopped halfway through.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Always forget to bring an alarm clock.  But not my Kindle.  Now I have an alarm clock with me when needed..
B000002H6C|4.0|This is one CD you just keep buying over and over again. I've played it so many times and then forget about it. Break it out again and discover how great this album was...
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I loved getting all of the seasons and movies together in one package.  I love this show and recommend it to those who like the classic detective/mystery solving shows.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game for everyone and its great. I rate five stars for this. I'm in love with this it feels like you are really taking care of a horse. It reminds me of my horse on my dad's farm it's exactly like taking care of that horse. This game Really deserved five stars. This is great for girls and boys. I just love it I can stop playing it. Keep it up =)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun and interactive keeps it interesting my daughter and I love this game love the challenges it's a little hard but enjoyable
140006922X|5.0|I like the way Aslan lays out his book.  He sets up what he wants to accomplish, what it is he wants to get across to the reader.  Then one point after another he achieves his purpose.  The footnoting to substantiate his findings his excellent.  I also like how he compares the life and times of Jesus' era to our own.  For example what we understand history to mean is quite different to how the authors of the gospels understood it to be.  This was a great read for me, I enjoyed the book.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I really enjoyed 'Knocked Up,' and other comedies by Judd Apatow are right up my alley.  Since it was billed as a similar film to 'Knocked Up,' and I found that movie to be hilarious, I had high expectations for this movie.  Friends further reinforced that this movie was hilarious and that I just had to see it.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was disappointing and I was expecting something different.  I kept waiting for this movie to get going with the comedy I was hoping for, but it never really took off.  Then it just got kind of depressing, as the movie steered further into real world-type dilemmas, and away from comedy.  There were a couple of laughable moments, but it didn't hold a candle to 'Knocked Up.'<br /><br />Perhaps being '40' as the title suggests is supposed to be much more serious, and less raunchy situational jokes.  I was hoping for a film that made fun of how your perspective changes as you get older...I found what I was looking for in a different movie called 'Grown Ups.'
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Some of the scenes were definitely clearer. I would recommend these to collectors & anyone who loved the originals. Definitely for Al Pacino fans.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Life of Pi is very well written which is why you will easily visualize the story and characters.  Descriptions of the scenes are wonderfully drawn into your mind.<br /><br />The book draws you into a dramatic and heroic world by showing the decisions and adjustments of a young man in fascinating action and striking visual representations.<br /><br />But, and this is a big but, before you get three quarters of the way through the book, you realize that you are headed for a possible, severe frustration.  I do not mind books that can become disturbing.  But this book identifies itself (as it did in the movie) as heroic and beautiful.  This book has a very different twist.<br /><br />It can be very disturbing.<br /><br />I wish I could un-read the book.  I would rather have not read it.  I recommend this book only if you plan to enjoy twisted and disturbing fiction.  Not for kids.
B007JNR4WI|4.0|The movie was good but there is apparently some kind of problem with my Blu-Ray player such that there are certain Blu-Ray disks it will not play at all. This disk is probably good but it will not play on my player, and i have no way of knowing before trying. I understand my problem is more prevalent with Disney Blu-Ray disks.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it's a fun game-just seeming likethe same thing over and over. Maybe I'm just not far enough into the game.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Very inspiring to watch, even if some of it is scripted.  The work that they put in is real, and so is the motivation I get whenever I watch this!  Highly recommended! :)
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Love the development of the characters . Story line is very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your kindle
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I love Tourchwood but never saw the first episodes. Now I know how it all started. I watch older episodes and really liked the show
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is fun  and challenging but there copying subway surfers a little bit but it's fun and vectors battle is also fun but really challenging I like how you can get different backgrounds I would definitely recommend this  game.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a great show.  Hang through the first episode and after that you will be hooked. Definitely hate that I didn't watch this when it first came out; spent a whole month watching all 5 seasons!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I just got started back in photography after<br />a 15 years Hyades.This is a wonderful program for anyone! You can't go wrong!!! Enjoy!!!
B00190OHD6|5.0|Great film but make sure to bring the kleenex...you're going to need a lot!  Great performance by Hilary Swank!  The boys are pretty good, too!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I like this type of movie because the history of our country is important to me.  Having been to D.C. this Spring seeing the Ford Theater made it more interesting.
B00AYB0YFQ|3.0|This movie is so silly and funny. Definitely not to be watched with a stern mind. I remember when it was first released and we laughed for days after wards but I imagine some of the younger crowd won't get the meaning of most it as its all based on older horror movies.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Hadn't watched The Goonies in its entirety in several years, but upon watching it again (which makes well over the hundredth time), I am still able to understand why I loved this movie as a kid and continue to love it to this day. It is simply a very well-done and fun adventure.
B0095P33IW|4.0|It amazes me what they can do with movies, take a skinny guy and make him into a power house. Lots of unbelievable action and sorta sad for Captain America. He is a likable character that can do some amazing stuff.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Love this author, he brings you into a world that I personally know nothing about. This is my 3rd book by him & he tells a story in a simple compelling way. In this book you see the same story through the eyes of every one involved & not until the end does it finally come together. Fascinating & can't wait for his next work to come out.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I watched this in the 3D version and the 2D version and loved both of them. The 3D is by far the best as the colors and graphics are so vibrant and it looks like you can reach out and touch someone. Lots of action and can't wait for the second one to come out.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|The first three episodes had me hooked. The story lines are unpredictable and they keep me guessing to how each episode will end. There is quirky humor in every episode. A couple of the episodes seemed slow getting to the point which is why I did not give 5 stars.
B000LC4TJ0|4.0|I was impressed by Anna Netrebko in La Traviata, so I purchased this because she was in it as Susanna...  Well, now I am very, very disappointed at her singing... maybe only for this Opera? Or maybe not...<br /><br />While she was singing alone, she seems good... and she's very easy to look at too...<br /><br />But in the duet in Act III, Sull'aria, Anna and Dorothea Röschmann sing together, and what a contrast! Dorothea completely overpowered  Anna, it was ridiculous! Anna can sing, no doubt, but she does not have nearly as beautiful voice as Dorothea... not even close! Anna's singing is more like that of a digital piano, vs. Dorothea more like a Steinway? Yes, it's about so called tonal complexity.... And her voice is not changed or anything in this particular duet... It was the same voice I heard in La Traviata.<br /><br />Or maybe it's just me... she just don't have my type of voice I guess....<br /><br />Anyway, all other male singer's aria isn't good at all as well, tempos are not necessarily all slow either, but they are just not good... I don't think I will watch and listen to this Blu Ray again, but this is a very clever staging, and something fresh too, so it was well worth watching once. Anna Netrebko is really beautiful here too, a very believable Susanna.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Books installed really quick. Package was as advertised. Thank You. Books are easy to navigate and are a blast to read.
1250012570|5.0|First off, I broke my guideline about not reading books with particularly foul language to read this book. If you're offended by foul language, you probably won't like this one. But I really liked just about everything else about this book. Eleanor was so sweet and tough and vulnerable. Park was just awesome. I felt like the way they interacted and interpreted each other was authentic... The misunderstandings, the wondering what silence meant what, Eleanor's anger. The whole book was just so sweet and sad. I thought that Park's parents were very authentic as well. Steve and Tina were totally the way I remember people being in high school. The only relationship that I didn't like or get was Eleanor and her sibs. There was very little love and affection and bonding expressed. I appreciated that Park and Eleanor weren't perfect, beautiful, wonderful people who fell in love in 30 seconds. It took time. I also usually really hate alternating view points, but it really worked in this book. I know this is a disjointed review, but there's it in a nutshell!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|All 3 movies, well mastered and presented. Great price, lots of extra features. A very good deal when on sale.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Brandon Sanderson has a knack for thinking outside the box. This quick read had interesting characters without sacrificing on the story line, and I enjoyed it.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I have been using for a few years now, and it has been really useful and efficient in predicting the weather.
B000P407K4|5.0|This movie is one of the best satires of the military industrial complex I have ever seen.  Next in line is \\"burn after reading\\". These movies take themselves seriously to the point of real life.  You would never believe it but the absurdity is real.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|It is Pricey but good. It has a lack of custom built deck options but that is quasi resolved by sealed features
B003G4W49C|5.0|At first I thought this book was for kids and teenagers but the psychology behind it is very adult. I bought it because I always prefer to read the book before the movie comes out and I'm glad I did. The although the plot is typical for a sci fi story, it is well written. But the highlight of this book in my opinion is the character development. I definitely recommend this book to anyone even if you aren't a sci fi junkie, you will still enjoy it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This was the free app of the day about 1 &frac12; ago and I've been using it ever since...if you like music or beat making or even just a time killer this is the app for you...enjoy it

B0070Y46UY|2.0|It took me FOREVER to start grasping the story...half the time I didn't know who was who?  I also thought that it was disturbingly graphic.
B003XRELGQ|3.0|didnt finish yet, didnt grab me, not my thing, maybe better at end. thought i would read because it<br />s famous
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought the book was well written, and didn't take me long to get in to the story.  It was fairly depressing though, as I have kids, and couldn't imagine what this family had to go through.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Twists turns never want to put it down<br />Great love story mixed with a messed up love story! Must read
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Best book I've read all year!  I loved and hated the characters, which is what the author wants, I think.  Great story...I couldn't put it down.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It had a good story line. A lot to do. I don't know if I would pay a whole 5 dollars for it if I had it to do over again. They should come down on the price a couple of dollars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book/story with all of its unexpected twists and turns...but I REALLY disliked how it ended.  How could Nick be so stupid?
B000ID1J0E|5.0|I love this movie!  You will too if you have had a childhood growing up experimenting with extra curricular activities. Only then would you truly understand and appreciate the comedy that's happening. If not? This won't make any sense
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I felt like it was a bit far fetched and unbelievable.  But I liked the way it ended, especially after all the mistakes the main character makes along the way.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is extremely fun to play with a range of characters and skateboards. You can even connect your Facebook to it to go competitions with your friends. It also has in-app purchasing which is brilliant. The game`s idea is &quot;world tour&quot; so it updates to a different place,Paris,Miami and now Beijing.<br />What`s not to love about this game? Truly a masterpiece.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|This gives you the big picture. The millionaire next door can really be me or you. Hard work, planning, and altering your thinking can really pay off in your quest to become financially independent! This book helps to lead you in that direction.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I heard about this game through my mom's coworkers since that day I've been hooked.<br />I love the playing with Frank, Coco from Paris, and now I'm working on getting Sun from Beijing. Excellent for playing during down time.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Totally love this game.  Great graphics on the kindle fire.  And my 3 year old can even play.  We would give it 6 stars if there were 6. As a new kindle owner this is the best game I have found so far and had no glitches or problems with it at all. Amazing :)
B0094M6A18|5.0|With the different story lines developing and intersecting at just the right points. This is one of the few movies I laugh out loud at even when I'm by myself.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I would consider a Webster dictionary<br /><br />I didn't like that in this dictionary the words in this book are all the same<br /><br />  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|Ended up taking it off my device because I did not ever use it. Maybe someone else would find a use for this application.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have been playing this game non-stop for days! If you like hidden object games you will like this. G5 always has the best games!
193700788X|1.0|I really loved this series and this final book was a serious disappointment. It wasn't so much that I didn't like the ending that CH chose, it was that the plot and characters completely deviated from what was established in all the previous books. I get that you can't please everyone, and if this is the ending she was aiming for, fine, but the evolution of the characters in the last books did not seem to lead them to where they ended up. And, for a personal preference point of view, the actual end of the story was disappointing for me.<br />On a writing note, the multiple points of view seemed strange. When the first books were all written in a consistent and well-written style and the last one changes, it is disconcerting. Also, the book seemed to be written in a factual, emotionless style. The small bits of daily minutiae that were interspersed throughout the previous books seemed to take up a large portion of this book. The rest of the narration by Sookie seemed disjointed and lacked the emotion and introspection in previous books. There were also some grammar and proofreading errors that have never been in her previous books.<br />It seemed that this was just a rushed attempt to tie up all the loose ends and wrap up the series. All the plots from all the previous books seemed to get thrown together in a disjointed group of convoluted \\"danger\\" that was never particularly exciting (partially because it was interspersed with pages of narration about going shopping, checking email, or randomly mending strained relationships with or between inconsequential characters).<br />This book seemed like the conclusions of several different plotlines, which could have each been their own book and perhaps been well-done, smashed together into one. Sadly, perhaps that could have been accomplished to the same standards as the earlier books if the plot moved forward consistently instead of being interrupted by pointless details. As it was, I found myself inadvertently skimming ahead and having to go back and read through pages.<br />Any chanced this one can be recalled and we can have a redo?<br />For the first time I find myself hoping that True Blood (which I started watching after I was well into these books) will deviate severely from the plot in this book.
B000I8ES5C|5.0|Everyone knows that  one of the most important traits of a kung fu movie is exaggerating human capabilities. This movie goes over the top into a realm where even superman could not dare to go :-)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really love this show! Lot's of drama yet I get to learn about history at the same time! I cannot wait until the next season.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a cute book and everything I expected it to be. Funny and hot. If you want an uplifting story this is it.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I tried and tried to get it to work.  Wouldn't.  Directions said it wouldwotk on my edition of kindle fire.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the unique and creative challenges of this game without it being too difficult. It kept me engaged without being frustrating.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I love Nicholas sparks books and I have read them all. I did love this book, but it just left me wanting more! The story seemed incomplete.

B009C7JS14|5.0|It gets the job done and helps me prepare for the weather since the desert weather is always changing I am happy it does the same thing as the pro but for free.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|It kept me on edge most of the film (plus some gross scenes),which a good horror movie is suppose to do. I did not give the movie five stars because the end was kind of confusing. Plus the siblings always called each other brother or sister instead of their first names.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app, for me is one of the best on the kindle market. I mean other people won't have the same opinion but this is what I think. Great job :P
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn loves the twist endings, and attempts to do that here.  I liked the book as an easy read, but she reaches a little to make everything fit and shock/surprise.  Not as good as Gone Girl.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway surfers. I play it every day. It is really entertaining. I think the worst thing is that the limited stuff goes away too fast. I really wanted the rose board but I was 100 coins away from getting it and it disappeared. :(
B00APYKXFS|5.0|I love this game. It reminds me of classic arcade style games. Super fun; not too easy and not too hard either. Takes practice, though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book really opened my eyes and made me look at the world in a different perspective. Sure things might not be perfect, but that is not a good reason to be sad. Godspeed.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|I am done with anachronistic, far-fetched take-offs of familiar tales and particularly original works of fiction. H&auml;nsel und Gretel, published in 1812 by the Brothers Grimm, and likely set during the time of the Great Famine (1315?) was considerably different than this drivel.<br /><br />That said, if you have no problem with rapid-fire, pistol crossbows with seemingly unlimited bolts (and no quiver), firearms, including a Gatling Gun (not invented until 1861, but, hey, who cares, right?), and while syringes were used to deliver medicines as far back as the Homeric Era, we still do not inject through clothing, nor was diabetes treated with insulin until the 20th century, then you might not be bothered by the seemingly endless string of absurdities in this mish-mash of 20th century foul language and inane plot inconsistencies.<br /><br />Better suggestion: Read the book.<br /><br />I am a great fan of Famke Janssen, and was looking forward to her performance. Unfortunately, her acting was so overshadowed by the poorly-written script and hard-to-follow special effects, that it was not even enjoyable.<br /><br />Two stars is only for the set design and costumes.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I have one word about this book. AMAZING !!!! Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children is the best book you will ever read. I couldn't put it down!  This book has adventure, comedy, love, and some startling pictures to help put images in your mind of who looks like what. I highly recommend this book even if you are not really into adventure books. I had to read this book for school, and I was so thankful to my teacher! People of all ages will fall in love with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.

0739425358|5.0|The Bridgerton series by Julia Quinn is great for relaxation. It's easy reading, a romance that doesn't insult your intelligence.
1781162646|5.0|I've kept up with regular \\"columns\\" for virtually every publication I've ever written for. It seems only appropriate that I kick one off for HNR. I've always been drawn to the idea of running a regular piece in which I admit I was wrong about a specific slice of entertainment. I don't change my mind about novels all too often, so the Admitting I Was Wrong installments may see extended periods of time pass between each offering, but you can count on the fact that you'll see more in the future one way or another. Even I'm wrong... from time to time (insert smiley emoticon).<br /><br />These pieces will generally focus on a novel that I initially loathed, but eventually found the beauty in. From time to time you may see me tackle a piece that I enjoyed the first time through, but found disappointing upon revisiting, or you may find an editorial similar to the one you eye now.<br /><br />I loved Stephen King's, Joyland. I feel confident in saying it's the finest novel I've read from King in a great number of years. I made that known in my review (check it out right here), but somehow, I think I still sold the novel short. If any novel merits massive hyperbole, it's Joyland, and there just weren't enough ten-dollar words or bold declarations in my review. My final rating was a 4.5/5. And... I admit, I was wrong. There's no way in hell Joyland isn't a solid 5 star book. It's about as close to perfect as one could hope for, and it lingers like few novels manage. Weeks after reading this one, I'm still thinking about it. The characters are still alive in my brain, and they're calling out.<br /><br />url<br /><br />Chances are high Joyland sees a second read from me within the calendar year, even with Doctor Sleep on the way. I'd consider the novel to be far superior to anything else I've read in 2013. In fact, I'd consider it better than any novel I picked up in 2012 as well. Truth is, it's hard to remember the last novel that made me say whoa, this is remarkable! But King's mystery/thriller made it happen for me. It's perfectly assembled with all the right characters and a gratifying finale. It's faultlessly vintage and extremely charming. If you're after a novel that will command complete attention, this is the novel you seek. King proves that he's anything but washed up (a strange belief amongst many \\"fans\\"), and he's still got a wealth of creativity in the bank.<br /><br />While Joyland is far more mystery thriller than horror, the macabre elements are most certainly intact. The dark ride, the elusive serial killer, it's the stuff of horror. But the novel reads like a remarkably engaging... well, almost memoir, at times. Hands down one of the strongest mystery works to see release since the turn of the century, Joyland might just mark the career second wind of Stephen King. Simply amazing, and realistically, 5's across the board. I must have been out of my noggin with that 4.5 star rating, and truth is, you should have all heavily berated me!<br /><br />Written by Matt Molgaard from Horror Novel Reviews.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I was afraid that after the first chapter that this would be the first Gaiman book I did not like but I was completely wrong.  I thought it was headed toward pradictability.  how wrong i was.<br />The storyline quickly took shape, was engrossing and came to an unpredictable end. I also enjoyed the developement of the characters along with the way Mr. Gaiman painted the intensity of the nightmare that unfolded.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great. It is like owning your very own horse. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
B005PK553C|5.0|This kept me on the edge of my seat. I was sad that I missed it on FX, but was glad I didn't have to wait a week to see the next episode. So good that I purchased season 2! Can't wait for season 3 to come out in October. Jessica Lange is a very talented actress. It has been great to see her reinvent herself with each season.
0761536434|3.0|This book has 610 pages (30 chapters) and was published in 2001. It is an engaging story about the *partial* history of video games with some great research. A more appropriate title would probably be, \\"The Ultimate History of Atari\\", since David Sheff had a lot more material on Nintendo in Game Over. Sega isn't a major player here either so both companies could use a lot more coverage. While it was an interesting read I did feel it wasn't as comprehensive as the 'ultimate' in the title implied. There is a lot of behind the scenes events and gossip but not exactly a chronological history of video games. Some stories are incredibly detailed while other major historical events get one sentence so the book lacks balance. The focus on classic systems like the Atari 2600 means it starts out strong but tapers off. The book is ultimately a little too large (physically) for its content. It's the size of a textbook but they didn't have to make the font so large. Since I did learn many new things about business, marketing and game development I'm glad I read it. This book is huge but could be condensed into a smaller format. Overall, it was a good read and a very interesting true story.<br /><br />The author defines the golden age of videogames from 1979-1983 so it colors the overall quality of writing in the book. Not to mention quantity because the first 16 chapters (out of 30 chapters) are all about Atari, Pong, arcade games, and other classic game systems. Nintendo is formally introduced on Chapter 17: We Tried to Keep You from Laughing and Sega only gets one chapter. So 8-bit (NES), 16-bit (SNES) and the next generation don't quite get the love some fans might expect. Ultimately, the author shows his biases for certain historical periods, game systems and developers. I wanted to give it 4 stars but there is so much more to the history of videogames than implied in this book. Also, not much focus on games from a fan perspective (it functions more as a history of the videogame industry and not games themselves). 3.25 stars rounded down to 3.0 is fair.game industry and not games themselves). 3.25 stars rounded down to 3.0 is fair.

1439156816|3.0|On Writing is part autobiography and part advice. Stephen King knows more about writing than almost any man alive. He didn't need to prove that with dozens of books in print that have been read by millions (almost all have been filmed) but he manages to impress again with On Writing. If you write one good novel, you're lucky. If you write two, you're a genius. If you write over 50 novels that are bestsellers (and dozens more short stories) then you are Stephen King. We see King as he normally is offering his insights and secrets except the fiction has been discarded. 1/3 of the book is an autobiography/memoir describing King's early influences, 1/3 is advice on writing, writing classes and finding an agent and a publisher, and the final 1/3 discusses King's 1999 car accident, a toolbox for grammar and a suggested reading list. I would say it was better than Danse Macabre. I'm not so sure it is the best book on writing ever as quoted by Roger Ebert but if you like the autobiographical format of the book you will enjoy this. The first 100 pages are OK (I almost skipped through it) but it really picks up in the middle where King's humor and wisdom shine through. King's advice on writing is quite good and practical. He advises you to start writing (no outline needed), develop story first and create theme out of it later, do not allow characters to overpower the story and don't worry about plot because our lives are plot-less. Excellent insights and advice depending on the kind of writing you are undertaking. I must admit the car accident chapter is depressing but required reading. King was close to giving up writing and almost lost his life. Fortunately, he lived to write another day.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Starting with the premier and moving forward, I was able to revisit missed episodes, get more of the back story and watch the repeating characters evolve in future episodes.<br /><br />This is also a great way around the Mid and late Summer TV waste land.
B0061S0A64|3.0|I can't accurately rate this app because I can't actually use it.  I was looking forward to playing with it, but once opened it shows a screen with two options: \\"create\\" and \\"listen\\".  If I click either one, it freezes for about 5-10 seconds and then the app closes.  I see other people have posted positive reviews about it working on their Galaxy S2 phones so maybe it's just mine.  It's just strange that I don't have this issue with any of my other apps.
B000002ITW|5.0|one of the best albums ever put out! The boy's show all of there talents playing on this album,one of the best!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This game entertained me for one night, which is how long it took me to solve all 40-something levels.  There is very little replay value, but I got it as the FAOTD so I can't complain about the cost.  The concept is easy to pick up and it's a fun little puzzle game.  The only problem I had with the playability was due to colorblindness.  The game shows you a ball with paint patterns on it and you must recreate those patterns on a blank ball by clicking on the paints and tools provided in the correct order.  However, on my phone, both the example ball and the blank ball are small.  Also the balls are shaded in 3d, so the same color looks slightly different if there's just a dot of it on one part of the ball vs another.  These tiny dots of color that start to appear as the patterns get more complex were quite difficult for me to accurately identify.  I used process of elimination for some of the earlier levels, but when I got to the last few levels I started taking screenshots of my phone and then blowing them up.  That helped, so playing on a tablet instead of a phone may help.  Regardless, it would be a great addition to the game if there were a few color palettes you could switch between while playing, so colors don't wind up looking so similar.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome if you don't  have it you suck I love this  game it so fun I love it I always play on every single day and every single  night
030758836X|2.0|I loved the writing and thought the story line was exciting and unpredictable.  I hated the end though.  And because of it, I wouldn't read any of her other books.  It was like she just gave up instead of finishing the story.  I was so disappointed.  How boring.

1451695195|5.0|As a Christian I am interested in views of heaven and most of them seem to lack credibility, other than of course the New Testament. This book written by a neurosurgeon definitely was convincing, believable, and inspiring.  I am very glad I read it and have recommended it to others.

B0055QYKQO|4.0|Waited a bit on this review to make sure it didn't outright break, but here goes! This motherboard pretty much covers all the bases when it comes to the essentials I wanted. It's a basic no-frills motherboard that supports USB 3.0, has a good amount of SATA 6 Gbps headers and  supports 2-Way SLI (Something I had trouble finding, Crossfire is supported more widely on AMD boards...) and is a real solid board to work with.<br /><br />Good things worth noting are pretty decent on-board audio for the price, it even has digital out via toslink. It also has more than enough USB 2.0 headers as well as a Fire-wire header, which isn't used as much anymore but some cases have it built in and I think it's a shame to have a dead port on your build. It does also have eSata ports, which I have no use of, but someone might. It might be better to try and add a second USB 3.0 chip-set for additional USB 3.0 headers if possible instead of the eSata chipset, but it's no big deal really.<br /><br />Out of the box you'll have to use an XMP profile to get full RAM speed so don't panic if your RAM is under-performing, most likely you won't need to tweak anything. Also in regards to CPU throttling, just disable all the power saving nonsense in the Core Clock settings and don't bother with Catalyst Control Center and you'll be good to go, although you may need to do a little tweaking for overclocking, though this might be fixed with the new revision with digital power.<br /><br />Tiny things I might fix are moving the USB 3.0 header near the SATA headers because the bottom cutout on my case is absolutely crowded with cables already and moving the header to another less populated position makes much more sense. More fan headers and better fan control options in the BIOS would be welcome as well.  Also the Etron USB 3.0 chip-set is not the stablest on the market, but it functions perfectly fine almost all the time, and any issue had can be solved by unplugging and plugging the device back in. Lastly I've noticed the actual socket temp being much higher than the CPU temp, which actually warms the back of my case, it's not hurting anything because the heat is being disbursed and is probably resolved with the latest revision where power delivery is improved.<br /><br />Too sum it up though it's a great motherboard that gets the job done and is very reliable over all, I haven't had any problem with the board that's warranted a return and  I'm sure it's even better following the newest revision. I couldn't recommend it any more highly who's looking for something that simply  works.<br /><br />EDIT: I still think, it's a great board, but the VRM design really does screw over FX 8350 owners in the REV 3, however REV 4 should be out and from what I hear that solves the problem pretty good. I otherwise still think it's a great board and am a fan of Gigabyte still. I will however knock off a star for the bad REV 3, customers should not get \\"second best\\" the first time around.Lastly I've noticed the actual socket temp being much higher than the CPU temp, which actually warms the back of my case, it's not hurting anything because the heat is being disbursed and is probably resolved with the latest revision where power delivery is improved.<br /><br />Too sum it up though it's a great motherboard that gets the job done and is very reliable over all, I haven't had any problem with the board that's warranted a return and  I'm sure it's even better following the newest revision.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Loved this game. Fun! Can be a little slow at times but after getting into more levels it picks up
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie was fun to watch.  Each character had a moment where they were able to grab the scene, giving the audience a chance to better know them.  Also, we get some development of the group as a whole, where they go from fighting amongst themselves, to working together against their common foes.  Absolutely loved it!

014241493X|5.0|This is the first John Green book that I have read, and I must say that I am really impressed. His writing is simple; yet, at the same time really rich in meaning. I didn't think that a senior in high school, could teach me anything about life that I didn't already know myself but I was definitely wrong.<br /><br />I adore Quentin, the narrator. He reminds me a bit of myself: having a schedule and always sticking to it, planning his life out and doesn't take any detours. Until he goes on this one night crazy adventure with Margo, and his whole perspective changes.<br /><br />The adventure that Q and Margo went on was hilarious, and fun. Something that you would only see in the movies, but wish could happen in real life.<br /><br />I really like Q's journey throughout the story, where he learns about Margo and his friends and most importantly, about himself. What is he willing to change, and what he is not.<br /><br />This book has a chuck full of memorable quotes, and crazy adventures with characters that I wish were real.<br /><br />Can't wait to read other books from Mr. Green! I am so glad that I bought the autograph box set, since I have three other amazing books to choose from.
140006922X|4.0|This is an introductory book on scholar research about historical Jesus Nazarene. That said, author did a good job portraying Judaic society, customs & beliefs and the impact of the Roman rule in Palestine in the years that preceded and followed Jesus. Author also contextualized the gospels and \\"translated\\" many frequent language constructs that appear in them to their proper meanings in modern language and modern way of understanding things. To the \\"noobs\\", author gave himself the trouble of explaining the evolution of the gospels elaboration and presented to readers new to the subject the Q writings (that are the backbone of Matthew and Luke gospels). Author also placed gospels in time.<br /><br />Regarding historical Jesus, author kept himself on pair with mainstream scholar thought. That's good because provides interested readers with foundations to further research.<br /><br />As it is an introductory reading, author avoided to expand into areas like the Gnostic views regarding Jesus and his followers and the confrontation between Gnostic and mainstream currents of the early church. Gnosticism is mentioned rapidly but some things are just overseen. For instance, author avoid the discussion regarding Gospel of John as an answer to Gnostic Gospel of Thomas (as elaborated by Elaine Pagels [[ASIN:B000FC1MEQ Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas (Vintage)]]).<br /><br />In the end, author presents extensive notes & bibliographic references.

Though it is a &#34;Drama&#34;, injecting things into an already tense situation just for a new twist really ruined the mood.

0670033049|5.0|I am adding my voice to the many 5 star reviews because Steinbeck is one of the greatest writers of the English language.  I bought a hard cover copy of \\"East of Eden\\" so that my grandchildren will be able to pick up this book when they are able to understand it.  I simply don't trust the digital readers out there to archive great literature in a format that will transcend time.

B0094M2ITG|5.0|I can't believe I didn't watch this sooner!! From previews I thought this movie was just about weird and out-of-this-world concepts but I was glad I was wrong. Story plot was definitely unique but it was one that touched my heart and brought a smile to my face :)

1781162646|4.0|I'm an avid Stephen King reader. I'm accustomed to long plot development as well as tracking the vast amount of characters he laces into his tales. This book was such a fun read. Literally fun to read. It was refreshing to read a King book in a couple of days as compared to the commitment of time his books usually take. From the artwork, to the writing style, you are reading a pulp fiction crime novel. The writing style is fast, witty, and almost playful in its ease to read.<br />For those not ready to jump into reading his massive 1,000+ books, this is a great starting ground to see how he can magically take you away. I'll never look at carnies the same again.....

B00CLZ48FA|4.0|While not the best movie ever made, this show is a lot of fun to watch.  It gives a back story to the original &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; that fits well, as well as having a good story line of it's own.  The special effects are perfect - they really give the film a fantasy-world feel without detracting from the story.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|But anyone actually interested in history and in learning about the many incontrovertible truths about Jewish and Christian history will love it. There isn't much I didn't know, seeing as I've been studying the subject for many years, but this is far more readable than other sources that couch history and theology in such fusty, academic language that fanatics have no idea what's being said. Fox news nitwits, crazy crusaders, would be inquisitors and the deliberately ignorant will be furious as they always are when faced with real history, but that's not us, now is it?<br /><br />Best of the countless books I've read on the subject.
1430308001|5.0|This chess book is unlike any other chess book I know because it describes in a very clear manner the thought process involved to find a tactical move that will produce a clear advantage. Other books on tactics simply describe the moves which you will hardly be able to memorize. I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to improve his level of play.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Sixteen-year-old Hazel is living with stage four thyroid cancer with mets in her lungs. Well, she's not really living, she's just getting from one day to the next. She attends a cancer support group because her parents think she's depressed. Well, hey.. I think it's natural to feel a certain degree of depression fighting cancer and toting around a portable oxygen tank for three years. With a revolving door at her support group, due to everyone having cancer and all, Hazel is used to seeing old faces disappear and new ones pop up in their place. Meeting Augustus Waters changed everything, though. Hazel would never be the same person she was before that day.<br /><br />I've had an emotional day -- combine that with PMS and I'm probably going to cry through this review process. In fact, you're in luck because I'm not going to write a novel about a novel today. It's not that this was a terribly sad book. I mean, it is because it deals with a very emotional topic, but the author makes it the most amusing heavyhearted book possible, if that makes sense. I think it's because the overall story is so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I love the characters in The Fault in Our Stars. Hazel is truly awesome with her quirkiness and her brilliant mind. She's determined, even if she doesn't always know where her resolve is aimed. It was a lot of fun getting to know her. Augustus (Gus) is equally fabulous and flawed, almost as if he was created to be Hazel's male counterpart. Their interaction is priceless, and something that I will not soon forget. Even the secondary characters make my heart pitter-patter. Very well-rounded plot and character development right here.<br /><br />I don't know why it took me so long to pick up a copy of this book. I've seen EVERYONE talk about it for at least a year, but never made the time. I'm so glad I finally did. This is a compelling tale about one girl's journey into a whole new chapter of her life, one that may not have happened if circumstances were different. I highly recommend The Fault in Our Stars to everyone with eyes capable of reading - no pun intended. Well, maybe a little. There's always the braille option, though. Is this book available in braille, Mr. Green?if circumstances were different. I highly recommend The Fault in Our Stars to everyone with eyes capable of reading - no pun intended.

B008UX2UIO|5.0|Ignatius is an abomination! Maybe because I'm living with my own Ignatius I was ready to throw in the towel on this novel early on -- except for the wonderful other characters in the book as Ig and his mother lurch from one catastrophe to the next -- the wonderful &#34;musky minx&#34; anarchist, Myrna Minkoff's impossibly politicized campaign to take his virginity, the mentally challenged stripper with a Cockatoo act, the black homeless bum (&#34;vagran&#34;), and more -- the characters take off and coalesce seamlessly from beginning to end. The New Orleans dialogue of the characters is delivered in their hilarious patois best.<br />  Written in 1963, the novel is a perfectly plotted farce on a par with Shakespeare that the New York publishing poobahs of the time could not wrap their heads around. It couldn't just be a hilarious novel, it had to have deeper &#34;sociological meaning,&#34; ie. a political slant, an aspect Toole did not understand, and indeed consciously subverted.<br />  His encounters with gay men, trying to organize them for some crackpot worldwide domination peace theory (gay-only armies) is among the most hilarious of the book's dialogues.<br />  I was reminded while reading of that great era of later 60s writers doing this kind of thing -- and especially of William Kotzwinkle's Fan Man, Manhattan's Lower East Side version of Ignatius.<br />  Toole put everything he had in this, his one and only perfect creation. Wish there were more. Nobody before or since has created dialogue to die for like this.<br />  Pray they don't make it into a Hollywood movie, folks.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Read this out of curiosity because of the byword for sappyness that Pollyanna has become.  Was pleasantly surprised that it is a book on gratitude with a fairly solid moral and biblical basis.  I think it's gotten a bad rap and is a needed antidote to the ingratitude in our American culture.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This is very easy to connect to the tablet and I like the fact that it charges faster than the standard cable.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|An instant success.  Quick access to one's own interests and review of recent uploads making it possible to conduct a quick scan with fascinating results...Thank you.
B0050F6JQE|5.0|Even for many classical music lovers Victoria is obscure.  But he shouldn't be; he was a tremendously gifted composer of very beautiful music.  These performances are superb.  Five stars granted without hesitation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Truly and awesomely awesome. Its amazing and fun for the entire family loved it. I cant belive this was free
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love the game. Keep me and my daughter busy for long time together! once you start playing the game , you get hooked :)
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Bought this for kindle fire bc could not find candy crush. Has less game types but still quite fun and challenging.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|If you are a Nesbo fan, you will love the way this tells all about Harry's early days.  You will also learn how to pronounce his last name.  He's in Australia and all the English-speakers call him &#34;Harry Holy,&#34; which is a hoot (and incorrect).<br /><br />The murder mystery aspect is up to the standards we have come to expect from Nesbo, and all the Australia info is very interesting.  All Harry Hole fans should read this.  And anyone who is just starting out on this series should read this first.  I have found that the Nesbo books I've read so far build on each other, and I wish I had read them in order. This is a little tricky because there is the original publication date and the translation date.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|What can I say, truly one of the best SciFi films of all time, a classic and now in the Blu-ray it jumps out at you.  Visually stunning.
B00AEBB8NI|5.0|As I mentioned in a previous review, one of the pleasures of my teaching job is that I am sometimes called upon to teach a class that is out of my \\"jurisdiction\\", and \\"Film and Literature\\" is one of them. The last two times I taught it, I used Dennis Lehane's Mystic River followed by Clint Eastwood's adaptation. This summer I thought I would change things up and use Lehane's \\"Shutter Island\\" with Martin Scorcese's adaptation. It turned out to be a great decision; the class ate them up.<br /><br />Many of my students remarked that they were chilled while reading the novel; one even compared it to reading a Stephen King novel. And this jibes with my impression (and the impressions of many reviewers here) that \\"Shutter Island\\", at its core, is a Gothic/horror novel. My students were equally engrossed with the film. Scorcese follows the novel up perfectly. He uses his classic techniques--the long tracking shot, the split second editing and choppy points of views--to make a truly tense and often horrifying nightmare come alive on film. Several episodes involving \\"migraines\\" are bleached white to enhance the photosensitivity of those headaches. These blanched scenes are often surrounded by shots of haunting darkness or blood red phantasms. The performances all around are on the money: DiCaprio, Rufalo, Kinglsey, etc. are all perfect. The result is a strangely sad film--there is that haunted melancholy that is so characteristic of Lehane's novels that translate so well into film--given the right director. Scorcese was the right director in this instance. This is a terrific film.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A book about two horrible human beings but darn it was good. Read it in two nights. Can't wait for the movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game but, it was just too short. My 7 year old daughter really liked to play this game without much trouble.
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|to me this isn't one of the best T.I albums but it is solid.  I'm not disappointed that I bought it but some tracks I skip past.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Love this show. Finally found one that both my husband and I want to watch together.  Usually our tastes are polar opposites, so when he showed me the first episode of Eureka, I was amazed that I enjoyed it as much as he did!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|The subject sums it up well.  I'm impatiently waiting to continue watching a very well-made series.<br />Great acting, great sets, great storyline.  There isn't much mor I could ask for; except more episodes...
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Best Sabbath, best &#34;hard metal&#34; in general, in a long,long time. Basically, the&#34;whole&#34; record is a burner, not just one or two trax. Lyrics get a little opinionated,to say the least, but its still one helluva cd.  If Sabbath  could make another&#34;second&#34;(sophmore) record, this would be it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|hate this new so called upgrade wish the old one was back why  fix something not broken.  just a bunch of ads.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|If you are an introvert you should read this book. If you are not an introvert you should read it any way.
B00B3EJ292|4.0|I enjoyed this movie even though I am not fond of subtitles.<br />Would enjoy watching again some time later in the year..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downtown Abbey continues to delight as always in Season 3. No less than expected. Can't wait for the Season 4.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book has events that completely turn around the story. This is not the typical cookie cutter teenage love story. Also, clare describes the events so thoroughly that it's like you are there, and it makes you get lost in the book. You won't be able to put it down.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I loved all the seasons of &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; and have all the DVDs.  I didn't like the blood wedding scene, because it killed the most loved characters in the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is my faviort game on my kindle all my friends have it. it is a fun game and I think that any body would like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like how they change country's because I like to see the difference between culture and how they are so cool and colorful.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'd heard a lot of good things about this book but didn't actually know anything about the plot. I was going on a 10-hour road trip with my boyfriend and his brothers, so I knew the three of them would be talking &#34;man stuff&#34; while I'd sit there in silence. To keep myself entertained, I downloaded Gone Girl on my Kindle. It was AMAZING. I even pretended to have a headache one night of our trip so that I could stay at the hotel to read while everyone else went out to eat. I love eating, so it's a pretty big deal :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is an amazing game, the first couple of times i played it i got motion sick because it is different from temple run in that there are hills and twisty turns. but after that i got used to it and have been able to play in the car and on an airplane. over all, its free, so why not? if you dont like it or it makes you sick you can just delete it and no harm no fowl but i would recomend it to my friends who dont get sick easily as i do have to take breaks, not a lot but still.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This is a bad way to end a very good series. This book is so boring and has no action or thrill like the othe 2 had. Just a lot of bad/boring romance
B0058VW36U|5.0|If you want a game that will keep you on your toes, this is it.  Hard but not too hard.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie will inspire anyone to apply what you learn to your family life. It's a must see with the whole family.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I'm a writer so this is incredibly helpful when I'm reading. It allows me to take notes without setting my book down and running for my notebook.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I have read and reread the entire Vorkosigan saga and was delighted to find this book as enjoyable as the rest. Great characters, action, humor, and romance, add up to a well-written rollicking sci fi adventure. I highly recommend it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I just started watching this series on the recommendation of a friend and I absolutely love it! I hope it continues to be so good. I'd definitely recommend it to others.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Loving this show so far. Into season 3 but back working on my masters.  May take a while but I plan to get thru them all!
0316067598|5.0|This was a recommendation for a gift. Bought as a gift for someone that only reads a book occasionally. He started the book and finished it in 3 days. Called me to recommend reading it too, highly recommended.
B00BLSAM3A|5.0|This is a classic and one that really benefits from good sound. The previous release had very good picture quality considering its age but the sound was very ordinary. Here we get a real boost in the sound quality and it transforms the release. This is now the version to get.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It works like a charm!  You should try it with your android device.  I found loads of apps that are FREE!
B005VU9LVI|5.0|I bought the European release which was a big upgrade over the DVD. This Criterion release lifts the picture quality substantially and it really shows. The images jump off the screen. No major extras but an excellent transfer of the film.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|If you like witches, magic and warlocks - this has the latter two in spades.  Instead of the Salem witches, this story tells the tale of the Salem Witch's descendants in the form of young men (The Sons of Ipswich) - who've inherited great powers.  But greater are their powers to become when they &#34;ascend&#34; at the age of 18 - and their b'days are coming up!  But someone else in Ipswich is using powers as well, and they are much stronger.  Where are they coming from and who will win?  Well, that answer is probably obvious, but the excellent rock music by Renny Harlin and his direction along with the special effects will help you ignore the bad acting.  I swear, you'll barely notice.  :)
B004SBX112|3.0|consider this as a pacifier.<br />if you have absolutely nothing esle you can can do then go for it.<br />it's for the birds
B002MFV2IK|5.0|Fabulous!  An excellent, gothic play on women's vanity and how far they'll go to stay looking young.  The special effects alone are worth the watch in this movie...but there's also Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn as rivals...and Bruce Wilis the one time famous plastic surgeon turned mortuary scientist who helps them remain &#34;young&#34;.  :D Tons of laughs to go with the excellent effects and acting.  Really a completely creative and refreshingly vibrant film.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Applicable to all age groups as well as personal growth.  References to teaching, coaching, and business professions.  Referred to me by a High School Science teacher. He applied growth mindset principles and experienced  positive results in his students, parental support, and administration support.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow...what an amazing game. Definitely one of the best I've played in while.  I would love to play another challenging game like this one.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|great game a ton of stuff to do, it gets pretty challenging. Its a different kind of tower defense where u can control some units
B00919CI5Q|1.0|The product worked three weeks stopped working for no reason and then artifact, black screen and can not enter windows in safe mode, never initiates GPU Tweak, to search without OC settings. The factory OC is very bad, no good.<br /><br />It was a waste of my money.<br /><br />Edit:<br />From what I see, the response by Jeremy manufacturer, seem a bot, no response, the idea is to give the image that concern and interest? , On the website of Asus there is no answer for a card that simply does not work.<br /><br />My Previous review was on a was losing my money, as I can get it back? or get a product that should work?<br /><br />I was patient but this is really annoying.
B005544TRQ|5.0|One of the best shows on TV that you're probably not watching -- amazingly clever, funny and not to be missed.
B001IASHWY|5.0|Great sequel to the first Hellboy. Includes a vast array of English Folklore creatures and I thoroughly enjoy the artists' rendering (same visionary from Pan's Labyrinth) of the creatures. The in-depth storyline correlates with the comics and the universality of the situations and characters offers a vibrant and engaging experience.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is so realistic and fun. It's almost as if you were taking care of a real horse! I would recommend this for anyone and everyone.
B00846REIS|4.0|This story is about two broken people who are looking for not only freedom but true love. In this story we really get to see what Eva's demons are. We also get to find out a little about Gideon s demons as well. This story will emotionally gravity and have you hooked from the first to the last word. I would recommend this book to anyone
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. The first time I got it I couldn't stop laughing. The minions r hilarious. The reactions and what they say is hilarious. I do have two questions though. Every time that I download content for the two new places it doesn't stay downloaded and I have to download the content why? Why do the minions look back and then scream? Is someone chasing them or what? Awesome game. If u love subway surfers or temple run u will love this.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|I enjoyed this movie way more than I thought I would.  I'm not sure how well it did in theaters or on video for that matter but my<br />impression was that it was only so so.  Maybe it was low expectations but I tried not to judge but only to watch and was surprised<br />to find that I thought it was a lot of fun.  The 3D looked really good and the picture quality of the 3D and Blu-Ray was top notch.<br />In my opinion, most of the time, films are just as enjoyable or sometimes even more so in 2D but in this case I think the 3D<br />was a positive addition.
B002XTXG1G|4.0|I'm a big Tom Hardy fan from \\"Lawless\\" but I didn't know he was so versatile. This film was macabre but interesting & show the many 'layers' that this man \\"Broson\\" was made up of. Scary thing is it's a true story!
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|This movie is just plain fun.  The picture quality was fine.  It has a great cast and can be viewed by the entire family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome cool fun funny when u get turned upside down cool people cool that u get to travel the world
B0061S0A64|5.0|One of the most creative and fun apps on the market today.  I have almost zero musical talent and yet this app is so intuitive and fun
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. It is beautifully written and the characters are impossible to forget!!<br />I could not put the book down from page one. I am overly obsessed with the whole world of the shadowhunters!!
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Love the Beatles. Seen this movie in the theater when it came out. After all these years, still love the music and the humor.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is very good! I recommend!! Isso eh muito bom! Eu recomendo!! You gonna like this. Vc vai gostar disso.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Selena this time leaned more toward a dance club theme with half the album having songs with a heavy beat which would fit right in with any dance club. While I like all the songs on the album my favorites are the ones where the music feels more natural (with musicians and not sounding like it was done with a drum machine or one man on a synthesizer) with my top two being 'Come And Get It' and  'Star Dance'.<br /><br />A 'must get' for any Selena fan and worthy of a listen for any pop/dance music listener. You can't help tapping along with the music.
1781162646|5.0|This is a good story from a master storyteller.  King's words draw you right in to the story.  Great, quick read.
B00AN0KBJC|2.0|but it has just as many in this season thus far (I'm not all the way though with it).  Also this season really veers far from the books.  I realize some of the veering is needed but it's pretty extreme.  They just make up new characters and keep important ones out entirely.  I'm not sure I will make it all the way though season two.  The only thing keeping me at this point is the promise by a friend that the sex scenes let up some in season 3.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|why is there an help guide but no actual game. its very upsetting. please make candy crush saga available asap!!!
B007BVOEPI|2.0|I bought season one because my husband had read these books (we bought season 1 & 2).  There is just entirely too much sex in this series.  I'm not a prude but it goes pretty far in my mind and borders on porn.  My husband said there was more sex in the first few episodes than in the entire series of books combined.  He said some things were changed in season 1 and weren't like the book totally but that's to be expected and for logical reasons.  I tried to like the story-line but it's very hard where there are just sex scenes in there for no reason at all.  They don't play up the plot more.  So, if your okay with sex in movies and series but not okay with a sex scene every ten minutes this may not be for you.  I do understand that sex it was sells these days, it just sucks that they feel after getting people hooked on the series they still have to continue the all to prevalent sex scenes.  It detracts from the storyline.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game it keeps my attention and makes me think of my next move love how big the pieces are, there's no need to strain your eyes
1577311523|5.0|I enjoy self help books, but this has been the best so far.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it!  It can change the way you think.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing!! great graphics and realty realistic. highly recommend. I Love This App!!!! and great for any age.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It would be nice if you add some golems and horses like the last update. I'd also appreciate it if you make the world bigger. Other than that, it's awesome! :)
B006BAEQB2|5.0|She writes some great books, this one has to be one of my favorites. I totally wish I had Starz now so I could see how they film all three of these books

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is fun but there's a lot of bugs and the screen freezes so much wouldn't get this game if I was u it's a wast of your time
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|First off, I will say that I am not particularly a sci-fi fan. I love to read literature by authors who know how to develop characters above plots. This book is superb in that way. The characters are believable, even in the fantasy environment, and the way the story is told from several people's viewpoints without descending into unintelligible and incohesive page-filling is remarkable. This is typical of Herbert's writing.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking to branch out in genres a bit. It's very engaging and well-researched. I believe Herbert spent four years researching deserts and desert cultures before writing it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I am so addicted to this game! No joke I play it 24/7. It is really fun and the best thing is, is that there is no WiFi needed!!  I would definitely recommend this game to everybody young and old!! I love it!!!!!!!&lt;3
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I expected not to like this movie but really enjoyed it. I've watched it twice already and enjoyed it as much the second time as the first. Very entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun. It is a must get. And it's so addictive. All of my little neighbors love this game
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This album is unbelievable! It's an awesome mix up of violin and different genres sometimes (like dubstep). I personally like to play the songs on random while I jog for that kind of motivational push. I also rarely pay for music but made the exception for this album.<br /><br />In conclusion: Ms. Stirling created an album worth paying for, do buy.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love it so much!!! Can't wait to get the great white shark and then megalodon so I can eat a boat.
B008518MOW|5.0|I thought the story was cute.  It showed the history of K & J as well as the background on J.  The 3D was good also.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|I'm a big fan of director Eytan Fox's work, especially his first feature, \\"Yossi and Jagger\\"  That movie told the ultimately tragic story of two male lovers in the Israeli army.  \\"Yossi\\" is a sequel to that film, though you don't have to know anything about the prior movie to follow or enjoy \\"Yossi.\\"<br /><br />The character Yossi is a lonely doctor working in a large Israeli hospital, who can't really make a connection with anyone.  A chance encounter reawakens thoughts of his lost lover and enables him to get a bit of closure on that relationship.  Or if not closure, exactly, at least it shakes him up a bit to maybe move out of his comfort zone.  He befriends some soldiers on leave and meets a potential love interest.  But even with taking some new chances, Yossi still has trouble forming a connection.<br /><br />Ohad Knoller gives a great performance as Yossi. It's not an easy role, and Knoller makes us feel for him even though sometimes his actions (or inactions) make us frustrated with the character.<br /><br />This is not a fast paced film, but an amazing character study.  Highly recommended!
B004G6009K|5.0|This was a very entertaining story for adults as well as children.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Main character has a cute attitude.  Great 3D movie.
B0007TKH66|1.0|This was my second attempt to purchase the first season of Star Trek Enterprise. I should say that the 2 attempts were from different sellers. In both cases the first disc had a clear glue like sticky coating completely covering the printed side of the disc. It would stick right to your hand. Every other disc in the package was fine and did not have this issue. It leads me to believe that someone at the manufacturing plant must have run off an entire batch of bad first discs. I am writing this to warn buyers of what they may experience. Thankfully Amazon was willing to help with this issue, and allowed me to return the defective sets. I already purchased season 2 and it had no such problem. Now I need season 1, but I guess I will wait until current stocks have been sold out, or purchase it direct from a store where I can open it at time of purchase, and deal with it on the spot if it has the same issue. I'm amazed at the lack of quality control from the manufacturer.
0425263916|4.0|i loved the first book and this is a solid sequel .... I have some unsettled issues with finding out the truth for eva and how she works but i also feel like i am gaining years of therapy while reading these books which is kinda cool since i already look at things fairly logical.  I can't wait to see what happens as Eva and Gideons relationship develops more and more... and the sex scenes are just as steamy in this one as they were in the first one =) happy
B0097K21YW|5.0|l love this game.  It's fun.  You have a dragon, a fire ball and some buildings to destroy.  What more could you want?  The levels are creative and challenging.  It's great to pass time.
B000FCJZUO|4.0|Great summer read. More than just a love story. Much deeper. I love that it was written in letter form. I would recommend this book.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this as a nine-year old girl and love it as much or more now as a fifty-nine year old woman as I did then.  This book is truly a classic that everyone can read and enjoy no matter the age.
1451627297|5.0|I expected a good story from Stephen King but I got more than that. It was a great time traveler tale, but also a good love story wrapped in historical fiction. After reading it, I have a real feeling for what living at that time was like. I recommend it to anyone looking for a well paced, enjoyable read.
6305428425|5.0|My daughter found this movie as entertaining as I did.  So glad to have it. She's shown it to many of her friends and they all love it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|enjoyable story that is easy to follow and items that are challenging to find.great graphics and believable searches.  good app for those who love hidden searches with a story line.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This is not quite as good a WWZ but a fun read.  At times it gets too technical when talking about weapons.  But is is a good compliment to WWZ
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is off the hook!  I love it and can not stop playing it. I can not sleep cause it's so cool
B000H30B2C|5.0|I just watched Peter Jackson's King Kong for the 2nd time and really enjoyed it.  I thought I would not like it as I am a very big fan of the 1933 version and have a hard time liking remakes.  I think after the 2nd viewing Peter Jackson's King Kong just works it's way into your heart.  I bought the 3 disc version and enjoyed seeing how the movie was made.<br /><br />King Kong is the star of this movie. I love Jack Black's portrail of Carl Denham.  I think in time this movie will be a classic.
0385341008|4.0|I've already recommended this delightful book to several friends who have also enjoyed it.  It's light, joyous story is the perfect antidote to hot summer days.  I feel enlightened about the Channel Islands and its World War II occupation that I hadn't been familiar with.  My only disappointment was that after such a graceful narrative, the actual conclusion wrapped itself up far too quickly, almost as if a timer went &#34;ding,&#34; and she had to take a pie out of the oven (a potato peel pie, of course).
B004QBWU02|5.0|The story line, the nostalgia, the stars at the beginning of their careers and the fabulous music.  What's not to love.
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|Harris must've been really hard up for material for this book. After reading it all I can say Thank God it's the last one
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game. I started playing it on facebook. But its sooo much better on the kindle fire.I absolutely loveeee this game
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun as heck and simple to get going the hills are murder sometimes dragging my nose in the dirt. Made me laugh out loud. Fun stuff
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Draws well from the comic books but adds its own visual panache too, though I saw the movie first then read the comics. The instant the first evil ex started his intro routine I was all in on this movie. Great fight choreography too
B000FC0SIM|5.0|There are many great books on the topic of writing by those who have done it for a living - from Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Jack London, to Shelby Foote, Norman Mailer and Stephen King. Considering King's track record as an author, this book is a must for writer's, regardless on what level they pursue their craft. I read King's book when it first came out years ago, and continue to read it again and again.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved it. It was a strange ending though. It had excitement all through out the book. You should read it.
0679809015|5.0|The book is a perfect size for my 14 month old to carry around and look at!  I bought it to see if we could find a book other than &#34;brown bear&#34; for me to read to her over and over.  She still brings me &#34;brown bear&#34; to read more often but she seems to also like this one almost as much.
B00C9U9YOW|2.0|Queens of the Stone Age (and related projects) have always been at the TOP of my 'favorite bands' list.  However, I have to agree with most of the negative reviews here in that this album just falls flat for me.  The long wait since Era Vulgaris just made it that much more disappointing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after listening to this record several times through, I was pretty much done.  I will definitely go back and listen to a few tracks like \\"My God Is The Sun\\", \\"I Sat By The Ocean\\" and maybe \\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\" every once in a while but I will never listen to it straight through again, as I don't care for most of the rest of the songs.  And I agree...\\"I Appear Missing\\" IS too long.<br /><br />I would like to point out three other key, long-time Queens collaborators that are mostly absent on this album: Natasha Shneider (RIP), Chris Goss and Alain Johannes (although he did some \\"additional engineering\\" here).  Each of these very talented individuals has left their sonic mark on some of Queens' previous best.<br /><br />I miss the days of listening to a new QOTSA release over and over and over...and over again.<br /><br />'As a fan' notes:<br /><br />Can't wait for the next Them Crooked Vultures release and tour!<br /><br />Also looking forward to the new Brody Dalle release!!  The Spinnerette EP/LP is simply amazing.<br /><br />Finally, I was lucky enough to see Dave Grohl play on the pre-SFTD tour and saw Queens again in '05 on the Lullabies tour, which featured Natasha on keyboards. \\"The Fun Machine...and Died\\" is one of my all-time favorite Queens songs.  Also got to see TCV on tour...more genius than one stage could handle, and that includes Alain.<br /><br />Rickshaw!
B0067R0APK|5.0|Tells me what I wanna know. Keeps me informed let's me plan ahead for outdoor work.like the maps too.easy to use.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I read this book after a hard relationship event in my life. I am a guy who never thought I had any use for the kind of stuff written in this book. While I don't agree with everyone he writes, the important part is that the book enlightens you to the idea that not everyone is the same and you need to work to understand your partner, in order to make them happy. Even if you don't agree with his stories or his line of thought, the purpose of this book, to show you that you need to make an effort for your partner, is spot on!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. It had a bunch of exciting and unexpected twists. I would highly recommend this book who likes this kind of literature.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Have a tissue or two ready you will need it.. Very touching flick  :-) purchase now and enjoy this flick
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|A continuation from the other Crossfire novels, the book nailed it. At the end it makes you want more, and to find out another one is coming out makes it even more exciting. I would highly recommend this book.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Just like the card game.  It's fun .  Very easy and enjoyable.  I am going to play with my sister.  Time just goes by very quickly.
B005ZMTXMY|1.0|I downloaded this movie for my touch pad, all descriptions said this movie should work. I tried a bunch of different options and this movie still did not work.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game!  I was impressed with the graphics and was sucked in to the game immediately. The only thing I would change would be to add more levels!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. It had an amazing, exciting ending, and I would very highly recommend this book.
0811875040|1.0|Like most, I bought the book because it was SUPER pretty.  That is as far as it went.  Even the latest edition (4th) has measurement errors!  The moment I flipped through the book, I found myself cringing because the conversions were so wrong!  I also cringed because as a beginner baker, I rely on these books to be accurate.  I remember following a cook book and putting in a 1/4 cup of oregano inside a tomato bisque soup.  Some of you may laugh and say how can your alarm bell not go off but I'm a beginner so what do I know?  The moment I filled it with 1/4 cup of oregano and realized I just poured the entire bottle of it into the cup was bit alarming so I double checked but it said 1/4 cup.  So, if a beginner baker is reading this book, they will do exactly as it's told.  I made the buttercream as it was exactly told.  Damn if it wasn't super sweet.  It was horrible and nothing like the buttercream I've tasted at Miette.  In fact, I've ordered the same cake and tasted it to see what it supposed to taste like.  The buttercream tasted nothing like what I've made.  It was definately too sweet.  There are rumors that Meg wrote the conversion of the measurements wrong on purpose so not to give away the secret.  I have no reason to believe this rumor is true but in thinking, why write a book and publish it knowing that the measurements are all wrong?  How careless can one be?  Also, she released the 4th edition, supposedly with all the corrections made.  Guess what???  The conversions are STILL wrong!  At this point, I'm returning the book and will side with people who believes that she did this on purpose so that she doesn't give out the secret.  Why else would anyone release a 4th edition but still is very wrong???
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Fall of Giants was a great story with an accurate background detailing the start of WWI.  By the end, you understand in part why the Germans wanted to build a strong military and economy.  It was also easy to see how people fell so quickly under Hitler's power; something we should never forget.  This book, of which I'm only 1/2 way through, starts with the build-up of Hitler's regime and other facist groups in England and France who support Hitler.  Interesting!
B006PAV1XO|5.0|This is a no frills movie, and if you like Jesse Eisenberg's acting style and humor, you'll find this very entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|No words come to mind when I think of this game...it's that grate...and funny...this he makes me lol....and my nephew's luv it to...if I could rate this app from 1- 1000 I'd give it a 999999999999999
B00821PCJS|3.0|There are just too many shows that have come out with similar apocalyptic stories. Walking Dead, the Event.<br />It's a decent show, good acting by some (but not all) but in this highly competitive business of Prime Time Series, I don't see this show lasting very long.
1881273873|5.0|So far, as I am using the principle ideas in this book and it has improved my perception to be more conscious of how I and others receive and give, to Love and Enjoy Life More.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This series is one of my all time favorites. Such a shame that it only lasted one season. You'll fall in love with Firefly!
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|I am a huge Jennifer Lawrence fan and decided to watch this movie. It's not one of her best at all. I think she has way better and this movie could have been way better. It was too slow and predictable for my liking. I knew right away there was something fishy with the whole Carrie Ann thing and the twist didn't shock me much. If you want to watch this movie I'd say go ahead if there is nothing else to pick from.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this Bingo Game!  I think this is one of my favorites.  Its easy to play and I turned all of the sound off except for the voice so I don't have the annoying sounds.  I do feel like there should be more ways to get Bingo dollars instead of just the daily play credits that you get.  However, they do give them more often then some other games that I have played in the past.  It is fun and a great way to pass the time, however, you have to play this at time when you need to focus on the numbers being called.  If there is a lot of distraction you will lose the numbers being called and get behind and its really hard to catch up.  Over all a great game to play.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I dove in the ocean down about 30' max.  The video quality on my H2 looked better than real life! Amazing!
B0052Z0MJW|3.0|It's a decent read. Fun and with its thrilling moments. Some parts of the story seem far fetched and some incidents a bit lame. A little stretched in the latter half especially with the relationship between Susan, commander and hale. My opinion is that it would have been just as good or maybe better with 30 pages less.<br />A good read over the weekend. 3.5 stars.
B005BGBPBG|2.0|It gets two stars only because the acting was pulled off with talent, but the sleazy message really ruined this one for me. The whole \\"It's okay that you are sleeping with your best friend's fiancee because they aren't even married yet - oh and by-the-way, she's cheating on him too with that other sleazy guy\\" premise just made me feel sad for people who have so little morals. This is so NOT the kind of movie I want my daughter watching and thinking it's what romance is all about. What makes a woman think that a man who would cheat with her on his current wife/girlfriend/fiancee won't do the same to her in the future with some other woman? What's to stop a guy like that from falling out of love and into love with the next pretty body that comes along and turns his head?<br /><br />I get so tired of this same old lie. Don't fall for it girls! There really are good, upstanding, moral guys out there that will be faithful and love you. Love is a choice. Feelings are great to get started on, but when those moments come, moments of anger, or disillusionment, or whatever, true love makes a choice - one that says, \\"I'm not feeling it right now, but I'm committed to you so let's work this out.\\"<br /><br />This movie falls so short of that truth, it never even took a step in the right direction.
B008NMT684|5.0|I purchase is for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it. This puzzle makes him think where does this go and helps with hand and eye coordination. He also likes the balloons at the end gives him a feeling of accomplishment. I thnk it would be great for kids from 1 to 5 years.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Keeps you occupied. A fun game to play to waste some time. It's fun to try to beat the round and get three stars to move on to the next level.<br />Some days or nights I can't put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I have a great time with this game.  We love the minions &amp; we love Despicable Me.
B000002J5K|5.0|you cant give this soundtrack enough praise. All classic performances  tracks 6 and 9 are my favorite. Regardless if it was released  a soundtrack, this is an outstanding album on its own.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|Excellent combination of their songs and very enjoyable CD to listen to. It evoked the whole reasoning as to why I initially feel in love with their music as a child.
B000005J56|5.0|Classic music deep rich and moving, this purchase was a gift. regardless if the original release date that was many years ago you cant appreciate this collection enough.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|I didn't expect to like this as much as I do.  At first listen, I thought it might be tired neo-prog.  It's not.  It's extraordinary, on par with the best of the prog heyday.  Comparable to the best of Marillion and Genesis, and all the other well-known prog acts (though none are as good as the first-mentioned two). One quibble (and I need to search for it), is that the lyrics are a bit &#34;prog-pedestrian.&#34;  Hopefully Simon will figure that out in time, find his inner voice, and write some really good original stuff.  Overall, a great first effort, and I can't wait to hear more.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|this is the unedited version, great music. absent is the politically correct editing that other remasters of this album have gone thru . This is a true Classic album with pop and jazz blending together making it an outstanding remastered recording.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I couldn't put it down and my interest was heightened as it always is when the unexplainable occurs in Stephen King's books
B00B32X786|3.0|The storyline was fair, just enough to hold your interest. Good cast led by Timothy Hutton and a young Natalie Portman who. went on to Black Swan fame.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I listened to this CD as soon as it came. I liked it so much I listened again and later played it for my daughter in law. She loved it too
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's really addicting and awesome I love and my friend does toooooooooooooo!!!!!! GET THE FRICAN  APP ITS SO FU REALLY!!!!!!
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Have to have a connection to Facebook. Wow, what if you don't have a Facebook account? What if you have a life?
B0060CV31C|5.0|One of my favorite Disney movies. I can watch (and have watched) it over and over again. Highly recommend it if you haven't seen it.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|I can only give the \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" box set four stars because like many the packaging is not up to par. You have to be careful when taking out DVD's as the sets themselves are packed cheaply. Many fans have complained about this issue which explains why Columbia is rereleasing this whole set again in October. Hopefully, the problem WILL be corrected so fans do not have to worry about getting their discs scratched.<br /><br /> The only bonus features are the ones from the Season one set which included commentary from the show's stars on the pilot episode and new interviews with Barbara Eden, Larry Hagman and Bill Daily.<br /><br /> In all 139 episodes are here and cleaned and remastered in pristine condition.<br /><br /> The first season's B&W episodes are not included here: the colorized ones are.
B004OUFSMC|5.0|What a great CD! You can just imagine watching them play these great songs, one after the other.<br />Wish there was more music out there like this.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|This movie is so funny and enjoyable. Jack Nicholson is the President of The United States! So Cool!!!!!!! I love satire and this one has it all.
B002E01LRK|2.0|The cd skips thru middle of movie..but a great movie...I will rebuy it later. When I have the money. I did not contact the seller.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. There was a lot of fighting and killing but Mickey Rourke was a King in this one. Anyone who knows me would know that cinched it for me!!!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is one of the best I have ever read.  It is an easy read, but the lessons set forth in the book are lesson which are taught well!
B002ZG999U|5.0|If you are an action fan, you will love this. Explosions and a lot of shooting. But the biggest surprise was Mickey Rourke. He had 2 scenes in this movie and the second scene made me cry. He is one heck of an actor in every movie I have ever seen him in and this is no exception!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I read all of the original Percy Jackson books in 3 months and enjoyed it a lot. It wasn't the best series I've ever read, but it was up there. So, let's start off this review with some comparisons to the original Percy Jackson.<br /><br />The main difference between Heroes of Olympus and Percy Jackson is that 'Heroes', rather than focusing on one main character alternates between 3 different characters. I enjoyed this change for the most part, though because it never changed the formula of two chapters for character A, then two for B, it kinda telegraphed who would be getting the group out of the latest trap. The Greek myth references are out in force in this book, as they were in the original. the action is exciting as ever, and Riordan has done a better job of making all the members of the team be useful.<br /><br />Now, the book has some worse parts. I don't know if it's just because I'm older, but the mystery of who the new villain is was easy to figure out, and it was annoying how long it took the characters to figure out. And the story contains a pretty big retcon that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.<br /><br />Still, this book is still worth the read, and I look forward to finishing out the series.
B00136NUG6|5.0|Great CD! The item was just as described.  The CD arrived in 2 days as promised. All of the songs are great!
0553208845|4.0|Siddhartha is the tale of an Indian man on his quest to discover the secret to inner peace and happiness. It's a pretty interesting character development book and a quick read, but you really need to be interested in philosophy to begin with to like this book.
B00AEBB8FQ|5.0|Love the entertainment value of the movie.  Some of the funniest quotes I have ever heard (we constantly quote them at work).
B00171R00O|5.0|I needed this movie to show for a lesson I was teaching and could not find it anywhere. Amazon's streaming service saved me! It even worked over my school's unreliable (at the time) network. Would definitely use it again, and the movie is excellent. It was the perfect movie for the unit we were working on (working to achieve goals/dreams).
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is some what addicting. It would be better if you weren't relying on boosters to fill missions. But overall a good game yo play
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Works wonderfully to make our Kinect work in our tiny living room (our playing space is about 6' x 7').
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Such a great game!! Really makes you think and use your memory skills. What a fun way to exercise your brain while having so much fun at the same time. Can't wait for more new rooms. Brings out the super sleuth in all of us!
B000Z27HLS|4.0|This appears the least known Austen novel with fewer adaptations.  Of the two I have seen, I prefer this one.  The heroine is the simplest of all of Ms. Austen's and appropriate here as such.  After just seeing the 1987 version, I find that girl rather too backward and gawky. The other characters are also less vibrant as in this one and the overall production is somewhat flat. Therefore, if you are a fan of the book, I would recommend this version as much the better of the two.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great at working your brain and it is a lot of fun. I have Alzheimer's and it is very good for me to play this. It helps me a lot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this game.  She loves the changing of the scenery.  she has fun playing this game. I have also played this game some and enjoy it at also
B00992CF6W|1.0|Minecraft pocket edition game is totally lame.  Too It costs to much money and is an<br />extremely very boring game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ITS SO FUN I LOVE IT ITS JUST LIKE TEMPLE RUN A LITTLE BIT AND THERE ARE SO MANY BATTLES
B000MD7OKY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but have enjoyed other movies more, would recommend it. viewing on my Kindle takes a little getting used to.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's fun and all but to complete the missions you would have to spend a lot of real money and not American money. You could only get through a little bit of the game before you have to stop and pay for things.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Finally a skeptical secular intelligent medical expert and insider miraculously survives the physical impossiblity and concludes, &#34;I am living proof.&#34;
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Trupoint had me at an inaccurate location and I could not change it. Extremely frustrating and there was no help available.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|To be honest, I have not finished the book.  I found the writing brilliant at times, and at other times awkward and clunky.. I was confused by the &#34;jumping around&#34; in the plot and found difficulty becoming attached to the main character.  I would like to know how much truth there is to the situation in North Korea.  It was pretty depressing.  Don't know whether I'll finish it or not.  Judith Busse
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it was so fun with halarias costumes and characters. its fun for all ages. my brother loves it too. and it has a lot of characters from the recent movies too.
1878424319|5.0|I found the Four Agreements to be beautifully written and it allowed me to open up more so then ever to not just how powerful and creative but, also, destructive words can be. IF you are a person who is opening up to spirituality, is already on the path or just wish to have a quick read that opens up your mind, buy this book! Then let someone borrow it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received this unit yesterday.  It works PERFECTLY with my Nexus 4 phone (who would have guessed).  It even works with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" on Netflix (perfect) and on Youtube (cannot signin so you have to search for what you want) and the Google Play would not work no matter how it is loaded.  The Kindle Fire HD had to be sideloaded with the Chromecast app and Youtube app but surprisingly it works very nicely.  Haven't tried it with chrome running on windows yet.<br /><br />Wish I could use it with my Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Well worth the price!<br /><br />***** Hulu+ *****<br />I have just received an email from Hulu+ that their latest version now supports the chromecast... it does!  Works great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just got this game the other day and i love to play it all the time, one of the best games i have ever played
B0035HKWM6|5.0|Very funny!  Carrey is great.  Have enjoyed him since his first series, &#34;Duck Factory&#34; (I think it was).  He played a comedy writer.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Look forward to the next pride novel  Could not put this book down. I love a great ending, a must read ,you will be entertained down to the last word.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Will Ferrell is at his best again here for this fun family friendly holiday movie. Zoe Deschannel is fantastic as well.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is really cute and very fun I think you will like it!!!!! If you get it you will love it!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Picked this book up to read before the movie coming out this holiday season and I was not disappointed. A true classic in the scifi genre
B008OOYALE|5.0|love this world!!! wish it was real. play it once and see for yourself! very addictive and fun online community
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I do enjoy these escape games, you actually have to use your brain to get through the levels and so far each one has been different .
B003P2WO5E|5.0|TSo good! It is a lot like wheel of time with the depth of the world and charactors but without the boring parts. I love Sandersons writing. Can't wait for the sequal.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Graphics are good and it is fun to play, controls could use some work but a decent enough game to play.
0525478817|5.0|Such an amazing story! All of John Green's books are awesome and this one especially moved me. Be ready to get the tissues out.
0465022227|5.0|This was the perfect book for my husband, who had just gotten his master's and was embarking on his PhD. As other reviewers mentioned, it's geared toward the sciences. My husband remarked that it provides an objective overview of options and pros / cons of academia, private sector, research labs, etc., which has been very helpful. Highly recommend.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|This is the second book in the series.  It is going a bit slower than the first but I don't mind.  I am still enjoying the story.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I click on the highlighted area and nothing happens.  It goes nowhere.  It was of no use to me at all.
B000002MZ9|2.0|I really want to like this album, partly because it documents a unique mash up of two rock icons, but mostly because of the grungy, feedback laden ferocity of the playing on many of the numbers. The lack of any real memorial songs, though, makes this album largely disposable, and not much more than a place holder in the works of either Neil Young or Pearl Jam.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This was an and exciting movie!  I laughed and held my breath at all the appropriate times.  I felt revived after I finished watching.
B00821OX98|5.0|Gets you hook line and sinker. Great cast, action, and very addicting. Best alien movies I have seen since ALIEN!!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book provides not only Sun amazing story but it gives you a sense of purpose in life something I personally believe we all need no matter what the religion it speaks to everyone. Thank you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this for the positive reviews and was not disappointed. I can not wait to read the rest of the series.<br />surprising twists in storyline.<br />new ideas about future of humanity<br />interesting tehnical and social probems
0307655105|5.0|Fabulous for vocabulary development . Good for babies then early readers. Also good for foreign language students learning English. Fun
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I've tired of people saying the movie copied this and copied that.  All movies copy something from each other and what made this movie enjoyable was that the pieces fit well into the story.  I must commend the director Joseph Kosinski and his editor.  They did a marvelous job of movie pacing.  There are slow cerebral moments and then high paced action sequences and never once did I feel the story dragged down or got slow.<br /><br />For a year of multiple science fiction movies from \\"Into the Darkness\\", \\"Pacific Rim\\", \\"After Earth\\", \\"Robot and Frank\\", and my much anticipated movie \\"Elysium\\", (There are others but these are what I've seen so far) I'd say this Oblivion so far is my favorite Sci-Fi movie this year.  I'm sure that \\"Elysium\\" will top that.  Definitely worth you time to watch and enjoy
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is an awe inspiring true story that keeps you on the edge of your seat during the first several minutes of the movie and gives you an emotional rollercoaster ride for the remainder of the film.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Couldn't put it down..the author has incredible insite into dementia!  I was living life with Alice!The writer keeps you coming back for more!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I normally don't watch tv but I was bored and reviewing my email from Amazon.<br />It mentioned instant video so I tried it.  This movie caught my interest and was great. I watched it twice.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I like this movie a lot.<br />All the stars in one movie.<br />Nice story good action<br />Hollywood at its best.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game. Lots of mind power needed though. Keeps u guessing and doesn't get boring. can't  wait for more floors.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator and very easy to use. Graphics are super and can easily be seen even with my old tired eyes. I wouldn't give it up for another app. It is definitely a keeper.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game very much. My favorite characters are tricky, frizzy and Lucy. Keep  it up try it its fantastic.
B003H6KRIE|1.0|After returning one set due to the disks playing to a certain point and then stopping, and getting a replacement set, imagine my disappointment when the exact same thing is happening on the replacement set. :( Not what I was hoping for.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Most of the book was constant flirting between friends who fell in love. It got quite boring & I was patiently waiting for something to happen. It's not terrible but I've read better.
1623420148|5.0|I felt young again. I loved it enough to want to go out and take another chance at love.<br />It was beyond adorable.<br />Would love more of Emma Chase's writing, love her writing style.<br />I even sent it to my 23yr old daughter although as warned, not your mother's romance novel, it has some subtle advice for women!<br />XO Emma Chase
B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|Ti West really is one of the best... He builds suspense so well, and with The Innkeepers the story cracks you up as much as it makes you crap your pants. I love this film... I saw The Conjuring last weekend and I could only compare that film to this... Same film making style... I feel like James Wan and Ti West are the only ones right now reading the same \\"No Cheap Tricks\\" horror playbook... Seriously, the best horror is like a good boxer, full of jabs, fake outs, and ultimate surprise KOs.<br /><br />P.S.<br />I know you can stream this one on Netflix, but the two commentaries on the DVD are worth the price. They are really funny and insightful ... You really get the feeling that this cast and crew bonded while simultaneously getting cabin fever in the hotel while shooting.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I have read the previous books by this author,all moving, especially a thousand splendid suns. This one is more complicated by distant relatives, illness, and a single act that changed everyone for generations,
B005LAII4E|5.0|I didn't get to see this in the theaters but watching it at home on the 70&#34; HD tv on blu ray, just as good.  What a fun movie this was.  I'm a big fan of action movies with the pinches of humor here and there, they just make for a fun time and really enjoyable to watch.  I've never been one who listened to the movie critics, and I know this was rated low by them but this is a cool and fun movie.  A lot like &#34;The Expendables&#34; or other movies like that, good old action, great fight scenes, just fun to watch.  The Rock being it is also is a big selling point, being a big WWE fan and long time Rock fan, love his movies.  Bruce Willis, can't go wrong with his movies either really.  So, anyone who loves action movies, or someone like me who grew up watching GI Joe cartoons and playing with the toys, watch this movie, you'll enjoy it I think.
0812993357|3.0|I'm a big fan of her work with Vogue and it's great to learn the ins and outs of the fashion world. I wouldn't say it's the best written book ever but if you're just in it for a fun read I'd recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The very best part of this book for me was reading the words of an esteemed physician who FINALLY has experienced what so many other people have enjoyed!  I'm hoping this book spreads through the cynical medical community with gusto.  Unfortunately, some of the more involved medical writing made my eyes glaze over (I'm blinded by science!); however I learned much about E. Coli that I didn't know.  Terrifying!<br />Overall, this was a great story that I will certainly share with others interested in this amazing subject.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show.  Exceptionally intelligent young man, changes from making a living taking the LSAT's for someone to taking a job in a prestigious Law Firm.  His shady past keeps him on his toes, while he wows his new colleagues with his photographic like memory.<br /><br />We enjoy White Collar, Burn Notice, Psych, Alias, Warehouse 13.  This falls right in with these!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm a walking dead fan and I didn't think I would like this show but the writing on this show is amazing.
B00008EY9G|5.0|While, no doubt, those who made the film are aware of Hitchcock's Motel classic, there is no need for everyone who watchhes to compare that with the Old Man's. Forget Hitchcock and watch this superior Who Dun It with a fresh mind. It is a good one. The story is simple, and, yes, one might might be reminded, as is one of the characters in this movie, of the Christie based mini-classic (starring, among others, Barry Fitzgerald) whose title was changed from that of the book to Ten Little Indians (look up the title assigned at its birth to see why it was changed). As I say, the story has a group of people blocked from further travel by flooded highways,  staying in a roadside motel, which had been built on land on which, long ago, American Indians had been forced to camp, only to die of starvation and disease. Among them is a convicted murderer and his guard, who also had been trapped by the flood. After  a bit of getting acquainted, trouble begins.<br />John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda  Peet, lead a talented cast in the ever more gripping drama. The story is built up neatly, piece by piece, to a surprising denouement  and counterpoint. The suspense is nicely graduated so as to keep one attuned with no accumulated fatigue to the end. This is one where knowing the end will much diminish the pleasure derived from the movie. There is sufficient violence to require care about the maturity of the viewer, but it is nothing compared to the average violent film these days.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Weaved well and always surprise. Excellent! Loved the build and crescendo finishing well. Second book by this author. Love love love!
B000JLTRIG|5.0|this was a good buy from amazon. it's a season that couldn't be purchased in stores in my area. Plus it was cheaper than the other on-line stores.
0765325950|5.0|I had the good fortune to read all of the books in this series over a four month period. Unlike many others I did not have to wait expectantly for the next book to arrive. I was so taken with the richness of the story and character development that I devoted myself entirely to finishing the series as quickly as I could. I was a little worried about what would happen to the last three volumes that were released after Robert's untimely death but I was delighted at how well Brandon picked up the story and brought it to its conclusion. This is one of the best fantasy series I have ever read. I am now looking forward to reading Brandon's work with the same excitement and anticipation that I felt for The Wheel of Time. Thank you Brandon.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this game is the best of the best I love it I love the graphics and story line best game ever
159562015X|5.0|This book really opened up some ideas for me. I have been feeling bogged down and just not sure if I'm heading in the right direction with my work. Definitely a great tool for building up your strengths rather than wasting time trying to &#34;fix&#34; a part of you that isn't even worth fixing! Spend your energy and arrange your work around your strengths! Go figure! Definitely not something I had ever thought of. Too many employers and clients waste everyone's time trying to make someone into something they aren't and never will be. While sitting right there in front of them is an employee who is super good at something that could already be benefiting the company. This book not only helps you identify your own strengths, it also gives you sound working advice on how to work with others who have different strengths from you! Worth the $$! Buy a new one so you can take the test. Otherwise, no need to get it!
B000009ED0|1.0|Didn't realize the songs on this one and the others are so nasty. Should have returned all of them. Nothing against Amazon.
1594484805|5.0|As many of these types of books do, this one makes you think about why you do what you do, how you do it, and how you can do it better. Definitely worth a read. Was recommended by several folks to me and did not disappoint.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|Now I know not to order any more of his cds.  Guess I'm getting too old for raunchy lyrics.<br />Should have returned.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is very entertaining. Once you start reading, you really can't stop.I have really enjoyed this book while reading

B009ZZDNT6|3.0|As I said above for some reason this 'Alarm Clock' never completed the installation. I have not yet<br />decided it I will try again. I did try 2 times and my phone froze up each time. I don't really need it that bad and<br />this is not anything negavtive about this app. I don't know for sure by just trying 2 times if this was the reason my phone froze up.<br />But since I probably don't need it , I won't take that chance. I would like someone else who has it to post back to me how they like it. That would be really helpful
0679805273|5.0|I bought this gift now for my child when she graduates, after having all of her teachers write a message inside. Hopefully, it will be a meaningful gift for her to see kind words from all of her educators.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I like anything that has to do with photography and editing.<br />This is a nice little app to have some fun with. It would be good for<br />kids to have and they could edit their own photos. Not to much of editing and not to little. Good
B009LDD5E0|5.0|The season had it's slow points but as a whole season it was good. I was really looking forward to how they were doing go split the time between New York and Lima. On a whole that was done well.
B004YLCKEU|2.0|If you're not already a devoted AHA fan, this won't make you one. Video and audio quality is good however the band's sound is extremely processed and monotonous. I suspect the appeal of the singers is attributable to their looks as they don't really have all that much stage charisma.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Having all my electronics on one gadget is awesom. So happy everything transferred to my notepad! Love having my books with me.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|What a fabulous documentary. A great insight into the recording industry of the 80s as well as the stories behind some of our great musicians, including Fleetwood Mac. Thoroughly entertaining.

B000BFH2S2|5.0|He has a voice like butter but moves like a guy with 2 left feet. And his dialogue is a bit corny compared to today's super cool celebrities. Having said that, he's charming in a warm unpretentious way and most importantly: the music is great. His duet with Laura Pausini begs for more duets from Michael.
0345803507|5.0|Fantastic book series.  I didn't think I would like it, after reading a bit into the first book, but was hooked and had to have the rest of the trilogy, and sooo glad I did!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I would recommend this book.  I couldn't put it down but I didn't want it to end! I loved how he completed the circle.
B003V5PQ1E|5.0|I don't know why critics and past LP fans don't favor this album. Yes they changed their sound but their song writing has gotten better with each album they release. And their sound isn't half bad, I like the change. You have to listen to the album from start to finish. Best songs are Burning In The Skies, When They Come From Me, Blackout, The Catalyst, Iridescent,
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is honestly the best sharpener I've ever had! It sharpens all my pockets knives to perfection, and even my wife's kitchen knives. It has the carbide tip to reform a blade and also has a ceramic tip to sharpen your knives to a fine point. It even has a diamond rod to sharpen serrations! You CANNOT beat this for the price... buy 5!

B0058VW36U|5.0|my grandson is really enjoying this game. It has many levels and the graphics are really nice. It's kid friendly.
B000SQJ27I|3.0|Although not quite up to Manu's own standard, this is still a 4-star album. However, I can't for the life of me get to the music tracks on my Windows XP computer, even using the command prompt. They are well hidden within the too-fancy-for-his-own-good &#34;enhanced CD&#34; executable file. Since I'm rarely around my CD player anymore, this makes the music largely inaccessible to me.
B0002HWQEE|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my 1 year old daughter and my 3 year old loves it as much as the birthday girl. It is well made and reminds me of pull toys from my childhood. I just love it and it will be passed down the generations in my family.
B00513DGIO|3.0|Parts of this book are very interesting - the historical / anthropological parts about the origin of debt and money especially. The socio - philosophical ruminations are way too stretched out and sometimes close to postmodernist word games. The book is also way too long - so much erudition is remarkable but does not necessarily have to be shown off so much. The kind of book you are glad you read in the end but sorry you did not find an abstract instead.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I love reading Gillian Flynn! This was a very interesting story. I did not see the end coming at all!
140006922X|1.0|The formula to determine if this guy is really a Muslim or not is very easy:  Any Muslim who believes that Jesus was killed is not considered Muslim anymore. This fellow believes Jesus (peace be upon him) was crucified. This is absolutely contradictory to Muslim's belief. Therefore this guy's Islamic faith is doubtful and personally I do not consider him Muslim.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|i enjoy stories based in the early 20th century England. This is a very well produced drama with interesting characters. Maggie Smith is the best!!!!

B004G606K8|5.0|From the opening chapter and introductions to the companions, to the climactic and bittersweet ending Weiss and Hickman take you into the world of Krynn and make you feel as if you're there with them.  Well scripted, entertaining, for fans of traditional D&D and for fantasy adventure lovers in general.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book. It was light, fun and an easy read. It reminded me of the Stephanie Plum series.

B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|A very captivating and intense show.  Nothing more to say. Get rid of the number of words that are required that sucks.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Classic movie. I loved it from beginning to end. Brings back fond memories (this was the first movie that I went to see without an adult). Parents be advised that this movie contains mild profanity and violence. Nothing extreme. I'd still recommend it for pre-teens
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Good interesting really cool and exciting book. Great for summer reading when your forced to read. Actually a great book.
B000YCLRBA|4.0|The quality of the singing by Fleming, Hvorostovsky and Vargas is extraordinary. Sadly, the production is dire, the sets hideous and sparse. I've seen several productions on stage that create a far better atmosphere and context for the protagonists. It's a pity that the artists were not better served in this respect. Even so, the magnificent music and singing are most entertaining.
B000BLI4PG|5.0|[...]<br /><br /> These folks do a nice job releasing extended scores of obscure films. They just began shipping and are only printing three thousand. It came to $23.98 USD total to ship.<br /> I believe this edition can only be got thru their site, I just wanted to let the folks here who were looking for a more complete score, a heads-up that it has final arrived!<br /> As an FYI, La-La released a limited extended score for Williams' 1941, which I decided to wait on, and am now regretting, as it is out of print.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I were introduced to Downton Abbey via a conversation between our friends.  We looked into it and were carried along by the story as we plowed through all three seasons in a short time.  We are saddened that we're &#34;done&#34; and now have to wait for the story to continue.  And wait we will, with great expectations!

B0095MVOMC|4.0|Good game to play to find numbers and also gives your mind a test. I also like how when you finsih several games it open to allow other new games.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I enjoy very much the X-men movie saga. This installment is great and keeps alive the interest for more X-men movies to come!<br />I never read the comics, so learning about the origins of X-men was a great contribution to the saga.<br />In my opinion, the X-men saga has a much deeper psychological content than many other super-hero movies and it has great suspense and action as well. In a few words: totally worth it!

0061474355|5.0|\\"... I loved the woman who lies here. She would have lived if she had loved another, but she did not. Sabriel is our child. Can you not see the kinship?\\"<br /><br />That is how the life of Sabriel begins. Her mother has died giving birth to her and her father decides to join the wanderers he finds in the forest. Sabriel's father is the Abhorsen. A necromancer who banishes or binds the dead that plague the living.<br /><br />\\"... the Kingdom sinks day by day, into a darkness from which no one will rise...\\"<br /><br />Sabriel is now 18 and finishing up her last year at Wyverly College.<br />Everything has gone good until she gets word that her father has disappeared. She has no choice but to leave school and search for him on her own. The road will be long and perilous ,with death threatening her every step of the way, but she must find her father.<br /><br />\\"May the Charter be with you, Sabriel.\\"<br /><br />Wow.<br />I had no idea how much I would like this book when I first started reading it. There were many strange names, the beginning confused me, and it didn't really catch my interest. At first.<br /><br />From what I understand, Sabriel was published in 1995. It is my personal opinion that some of the best books written were published between the late 90s and early 2000s. Sabriel is a perfect example of that theory. Let's be honest, books published in the last few years (especially after Twilight) are more \\"romance\\" than anything else. And I, for one, prefer a lot more action and magic in my books. I don't enjoy having to sit through page after page of teenagers lusting after each other. Yuck!<br />This book can't be compared to anything I have ever read before. Not Harry Potter, not The Last Apprentice, nothing. The magic is different, the atmosphere is pretty much the same: good vs evil, the town, city, country, is plagued by evil, only a few people possess the willpower and strength to defeat it, blah blah blah. But the way the magic is performed and used is different.<br /><br />The characters are fully fleshed, intelligent, outspoken, and brave. Well, brave enough. I loved them. From Sabriel and Touchstone to Mogget and Colonel Horyse. Except for Kerrigor, of course. I didn't like Kerrigor...<br /><br />I liked Sabriel more than I liked Katniss, believe it or not. I only hope she stays how she is now and doesn't get annoying like most characters tend do later on down the line.<br /><br />& Touchstone. Oh, Touchstone. By page 220 I was irrevocably and undeniably in love with him. Touchstone, please tell me that I'll be reunited with you in the next 2 books. I won't be able to stand it if you're not there!<br /><br />Mogget. I actually liked Mogget, he's witty and sarcastic. And scary when without a collar...<br /><br />The story couldn't have been any cooler. Don't get me wrong, some parts left me a bit confused but I'm blaming that on the fact that I'm a little slow and because I rushed through some parts to find out what happens in the end. I'm sure I'll get it when I re-read it.<br />I've noticed that many Fantasy books are dark. Sabriel falls into that category. People are betrayed, murdered, enslaved by both the living and the dead.<br />But I find that I prefer reading books with dark undertones. It always makes the story more interesting for some reason...<br /><br />But, anyway, this book is excellent. There's plenty of action and only a tiny bit  of romance. That's the perfect combination for me.<br />Take note, YA authors, THIS is what YA books should be like. More action, less making out. I would read a lot more YA books if I knew it wasn't just a huge kiss-fest.<br /><br />If you like the HP series or The Last Apprentice series,<br />I HIGHLY recommend Sabriel.s different.<br /><br />The characters are fully fleshed, intelligent, outspoken, and brave.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Found the story fascinating.  I found Kerman accepting responsibility refreshing.  She could have played the victim and got away with it.  I agree with her about the prison system being broken it should be changed.  I also found the stories of her friends from prison interesting.  Overall very good book highly recommended.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Not a day has passed that I don't play this game. I keep alternating between this game and Sims Freeplay all day.<br />The only thing that aggravates me is that you need to either invite people on facebook or pay 10000 coins in order to unlock more levels. What's that about?<br />Oh, and I hate having to wait 20 minute to regain a life. I f it wasn't for that I'd spend all day on this game.<br /><br />Good thing I don't have a life :D
B004A8ZX28|4.0|Shipping was fast. Only made this purchase because I saw it on a plane but fell asleep and wanted to see the rest. Course turns out the next week after receiving this that it was on regular TV over and over again.

B000I5X81A|5.0|This is an outstanding album all the way through. Very deserving Grammy Award winner for best blues album. Eric brings J.J.'s work to a higher level. They are just magic together. I love the entire album, but my favorite song is Last Will and Testament. J.J., RIP.
B00516G6ME|5.0|I was unsure about this one at first, but once it came I was thrilled! Awesome size in comparison to the rest, and the different hairstyles you can add makes it really feel like Franky. A great addition to any &#34;One Piece&#34; collection!
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|Well credentialed cast, good performances but a story line that will not have you on the edge of your chair.  It helps to be over 60.  Enjoyed it though.  Dreyfuss?  Its been a long time since American Graffiti and Jaws!
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Fantastic read.  Emotional, clever and intriguing.  Never a dull moment. I was actually upset that I had finished the book.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|When this set was first released it was bombarded with negative reviews, many from people who never even watched this set, there main complaint \\"the changes\\" that George Lucas put in his movies. Most of the reviews that came out did not say anything about the video quality, sound or bonus features just complaints about George Lucas's tinkering of his movies. It also seemed anybody who had anything positive to say were quickly attacked by people for not agreeing with their opinions. One thing I mentioned back then was that I believed that after more and more people bought this set and actually watched it that more positive reviews would come out, and luckily I was right. Now there are more 5 star reviews than 1 star reviews and most negative reviews that come out are based on a missing disc or won't play on their Blu-Ray players.<br /><br />I have seen EVERY version released on home video from VHS to Laserdisc, DVD and now the Blu-Ray release. The picture has NEVER looked this good before and although I thought they did a great job on the DVD release it just couldn't look as it does now on Blu-Ray. The original movies look like they were shot yesterday and hold up very well next to the prequel movies picture quality. It is truly amazing what they can do with movies as old as the original trilogy to bring it up to today's standards.<br /><br />The sound is also very good especially if you have a good surround sound system. You can hear ships and sounds from behind you and the Millenium Falcon sounds amazing, the bass makes it sound very powerful. Some people have complained that the sound is not consistent if you watch it without a surround sound system and although I am sorry for that they need to realize that this set was intended for people to run it with surround sound. I have heard these on regular TV speakers too and although it did not bother me I did notice the sound effects, explosions and so on were quite a bit louder than when characters were talking.<br /><br />The bonus features for this set are very good too, they finally have the deleted scenes available for the first time that fans have been begging for. Although I loved the original DVD Empire of Dreams documentary I do understand why it was not included in this set. One thing I have seen MANY times over the years are customers complain of double dipping, and get angry when the same thing shows up on a newer set that was available on a previous set. They tend to feel cheated for having to pay for the same things twice so I do understand not having it on the Complete Saga. The bonus material is broken up on to 3 discs, the first disc is for the prequel movies, the second is for the original trilogy movies and the last is further documentaries and specials.<br /><br />I have said before I do understand why people were not happy with the changes in these movies and felt the unaltered versions should have been included, but this is a VERY good set and shows a lot of work went into it and again as stated by myself and many others these are George Lucas's movies, he created the universe, made them as he wanted to and upgraded them to the way he wanted. He did not work within the studios so he could make these movies HIS way and not have the studio system change them. He paid a lot of his own money to keep it that way and dropped out of the director's guild. So yes these movies truly belong to George Lucas, fans did not contribute to the making of these movies in any way, they just bash him and feel he went against them. I am not sucking up to George Lucas (as many people have been accused of). I just understand his right to make his own movies the way he wants them to be.<br /><br />Now that Disney has the rights to Star Wars I am curious if they will release the original unaltered trilogy and that would be awesome. Already there are a lot of negative things being said about the next movie coming out in 2015, guess we will all have to wait and see. In the meantime wehave this Blu-Ray set to watch and enjoy and as I said earlier I am glad more and more people seem to like this set as much as I do.have this Blu-Ray set to watch and enjoy and as I said earlier I am glad more and more people seem to like this set as much as I do.
B008JFUNTG|5.0|Here we go with the second chapter of this popular series, based on the book by Rick Riordan, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Sea of Monsters. This time directed by Thor Freudenthal (\\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\") whose main job here seems to be producing Computer Generated Images... A movie based on a book this fantastical HAS to include CGI, so I'm not complaining...this time. Plus I appreciate the fact that kids are referred back to Greek mythology to read about the Golden Fleece.<br /><br />The invisible shield that protects the half-bloods' safe haven has evaporated because the tree that created it is dying. Their only hope is the Golden Fleece because of its restorative powers.<br /><br />Here they are again:<br />  * Logan Lerman (\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\") is Percy, our dauntless half-blood (his father is Poseidon, God of the Sea). He can (sometimes) control the seas...<br />  * Alexandra Daddario (\\"Percy Jackson: Lightening Thief\\"), Annabeth is determined to retrieve the Golden Fleece. She is sort of a Hogwarts Hermione: she READS!<br />  * Nathan Fillian (\\"Much Ado About Nothing\\") surprises us as a UPS guy/Hermes. His son Luke is mad at him... But he gives our hero some terrific packing tape!<br />  * Stanley Tucci (\\"Hunger Games\\") is Dionysus. Zeus is still mad, so he turns his wine into water. He has heard Christians have a god who can do the reverse...\\"Now THERE is a God!\\"<br />  * Brandon T. Jackson (\\"Tropic Thunder\\") is cloven-hoofed Grover, another half-blood and a loyal pal.<br />  * Jake Abel (\\"I Am Number Four\\") is Hermes' son Luke; he looks like a young Kevin Bacon! He has serious daddy issues and goes to the Dark Side.<br /><br />This has a PG rating, so expect no nudity, no profanity, a bit of vehicular mayhem in a taxi (three hags driving it share one eyeball), lots of swordplay and fisticuffs but no blowie uppie stuff. There is a great storm at sea, though.<br /><br />I've asked Amazon to notify me when the DVD is available.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is a great fun game.<br />You have to use lots of different skills which is good for kids
0553108034|3.0|I can't say that this story and the writing are amoung my favorites but the book is worth the read.  Of course, I am one of those who started the books after seeing the HBO series.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|My son loved it :) He keeps watching it over and over. So happy this was available for instant watch.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|Man, buddy knows how to continue GREAT blues.  The man is undeniably one of the best that ever got the blues bug.  OUTSTANDING!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|&#34;The Picture of Dorian Gray&#34;  was an interesting book topic still applicable in today's world. Vanity and beauty, evil and good.
B001NLKWLW|1.0|I tried to get thru this book several times.  I am half way through and i am giving up. Very unusual for me. There's too much going back and forth with the characters.  Tell a story in how it was experienced, it would be a much better story. What a disappointment.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a fun activity and definitely has its challenging levels.  I am interested in what other levels they come out with. A great game for different ages too.  I was surprised when my 5 year old daughter was playing it and doing very well.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|This movie is pretty creepy. it is about time they made a decent horror film. this movie is not only scary but also intense. I love the backstory to mama. I would not consider mama a bad guy at all.all she wanted was her baby back. but then again she kind of was. they gave mama humanity and not just making her another spook. she has a reason for roaming the earth. the effects of mama were pretty creepy. they story was great and the little girls were awesome at their parts especialy the one who played lilly she did a great job being creepy. this is a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love dragonvale and the fact that you never get bored with the same dragons because they add new dragons frequently. My favorite game!!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|The construction of the case is excellent as I expected.  One doesn't give it a second  thought because it does its job well protecting the Fire and is never in the way. Its cost is reasonable and does not arise in the normal thought process.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have had this app for a while now and I love it!! I fall asleep at night listening to British talk radio.I have tune in radio on my Kindle fire and my galaxy 3.<br />It is with me everywhere I go...I recommend it.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I love this little guy. Keeps me entertained while waiting at doctors office and for the dentist. Lol<br />I have him on all of my devices now. Yeah Amazon Kindle Fire HD!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Having read a few of Jodi Picoult's books they usually deal with quite heavy issues and have some kind of twist towards the end of the book.  In this book it deals with a suicide pact and the consequences that end up as a result.  Two families that were the closest of friends are torn apart and neither family escapes being scarred by the events that took place one fateful night.  Over the course of the story as we find out some of what happens to the characters in the aftermath, you are also treated to the story of how the two families became friends.  Over the course of the story it makes you wonder whether or not their were any clues to what ultimately happens and whether or not someone in one of the two families could have done anything differently and how much they really knew their kids as the girl in the story has a secret about something horrible that happened to her.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again, Khaled Hosseini makes his audience understand just how important the bonds of family and friendship actually are. The way he twists the characters' lives to all relate is so intriguing. Hosseini illustrates that even though cultures have many differences, the people who make up these cultures are the same: we all just want to be loved.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I've enjoyed Nicholas Sparks books and movies over the years so it was nice finding this book at a pretty good price and decided to go ahead and get it.  Kate moves to North Carolina and is just trying to live her life when we see her in the book.  It becomes pretty clear she is hiding from something or someone and that she's just wanting to live a nice quiet life.  She does end up becoming friends with the neighbor next door as well as with a handsome widower and his two kids.  Pretty soon she's not just existing as she starts to break the walls down around herself as she becomes more and more friendly and attached to the young family.  Over the course of the book, we find out more about what she's hiding from and how she was able to start her life over somewhere else.  This was written a bit different then other Nicholas Sparks books as it has the added element of what she's been hiding from but it does have the kind of setting that's familiar in prior books.  I enjoyed it as much as any other novel/movie based on one of his books and am glad I purchased it.  I highly enjoyed it and was even kind of intrigued by a bit of the twist that was presented at the end of the book and even made me like the story even more.  As the quality of the Kindle version of the book was so well, I'd consider buying more Nicholas Sparks Kindle books in the future.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Thrilling book. Easy read with lots of twists and turns. Can't wait to read the next jack reacher by lee child
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|A lot of people seem to have this problem, but the game freezes at the loading screen and never starts.  People seem to like it so I'd be happy to revise my review if they ever get this problem fixed.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game keeps kids and adults entertained for hours. Love it!! Minions are the best!! Love love love love love love it!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun! There is always something fun and new around each corner.  My son and I have a great time playing, the launcher is awesome!
B00AQB2A3I|3.0|I have always loved Steven Wilson and have everything he's ever done, but I feel he is straying too far down the path of eclecticism with this one as it just doesn't hold together as a complete album, feeling like a collection of experiments instead.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved season one and this season was very rich in detail and story line!  Can't wait to see next season
6305603847|5.0|This is one of those strange occasions when the movie of the album is better than the album it came from. This is quite stunning in it's power and the music tells the story along with the film. The album itself was a bit overblown and self indulgent but this is magnificent
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was beautifully written and is one of the greatest books I have ever read. It has all the components of a fantastic novel. Romance, tragedy, and so much more. This book is a book that you buy at the store, reread it all the time, and save it so that you can share with others. I would recommend it to everyone.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I really enjoy the characters that Michael Connelly develops and the true to life cases that he tells.  This is another one that will keep you on edge as you try to figure out what is going on and &#34;Who done it&#34;.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought 50 Shades was excellent. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys BDSM or a romantic love story with a twist.
B0045INTVA|3.0|After watching &#34;Redux&#34;, my general reaction was &#34;meh&#34;.  According to the sources, the audio was greatly cleaned up, especially at the first of the movie.  I remember seeing the original at the theater in around 1979 (?).  I also remember how dark and gloomy it was, with almost unintelligible audio at times.<br /><br />So.....the audio is vastly superior....I guess.  Or maybe it's just being played on newer equipment, I don't know.<br /><br />The &#34;meh&#34; comes from all the added footage.  The 2 longest scenes involved the Playboy bunnies and the French plantation, both of which added absolutely nothing to the movie, except to make it longer.  The bunny scene was dark and difficult to understand (the audio).  It added nothing to the story.  The French plantation scene was, once again, difficult to understand due to the heavy French accents.  Plus, the political topics were so arcane, especially for today's viewers, that it left you kinda saying &#34;so what&#34;.  And then there was the obligatory anti-war America-bashing, which was tiresome.  Both scenes did, however, provide a little skin in the midst of the war, if you like that sort of thing.  Personally, the only skin I like to see in a war flick is dead bad-guys.<br /><br />So......&#34;Redux&#34; is interesting to watch, just because it's there, but I prefer the original cut.  YMMV.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Outstanding performance!  The movie version was lackluster and failed to capture the excitement and intensity of this performance.  Very pleased.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|always loved Persona games this on is a remake of the ps2 game, with more content and a new story part the online is Junk but the game is awesome [People send you SoS and they don't reply to yours]
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Happy with this app, so much better than all the other crap out there.<br />Love the videos also!<br />Travel portion of the app is great also!

B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Excellent business networking tool.<br />Recommended for anyone in the business world who want to keep a pulse on what is going on.
1400082773|5.0|I just finished this book. I thought it was very well written. There were many interesting glimpses into the personal foundation of Barack Obama. After reading this I felt closer to understanding this person. This is probably the most eloquent a piece of work I have ever read. I would like to read more such as where this story ends and the next phase of life begins. He only touched briefly about Michelle. I would like to read more about the two of them. Perhaps this is in one of his other books.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|BB was fun until I reached level 50 or so.  I am currently at level 88 and find it difficult to even get a face card.  Daily credits are not right amount - sent numerous requests to customer service and still have gotten no reply or fix.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I could not put this beautifully written story down.  If you don't read any other book this year, read this one!

B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Good acting the young man was quite impressive.  A lot of splice film that everyone in the world has seen over and ove by media looking to fill the networks appetite.
0385349947|5.0|Bought this as a college graduation gift for my granddaughter. She was pleased to receive this book.  Bought on the reviews and interviews on cable with the author.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|A whole lot of twists and turns.  Cannot wait to read more of the Harry Hole novels.  Glad someone suggested this author to me.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I bought for my 3 nephews and they love this game and have gotten a lot of use from it. I like it uses their imagination and thinking skills.
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|This is amazing. I was moved from the beginning to the end of the album and can't stop listening to it everywhere I go, whatever I do.
B0061S0A64|4.0|This is a nice, fun little app that is worth a try.<br /><br />Its so nice that Amazon feels the need to hand it out as TFAOTD again.<br /><br />With all the apps out there we sure are seeing repeats a lot lately.<br /><br />Maybe amazon should change &quot;a free app everyday&quot; to &quot;the same couple apps every other month&quot;.
B000SZK41M|1.0|They said the F-word almost every other word.Just about the same with GD words.Even a few uses of the F-word with mother before them.The action parts were great but the language was just way to much.
B00E0ZEDI6|5.0|Great album. Please understand that it is an EP album and not a main album like Adam would normally put out.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I started reading this book also out of curiosity and as it is not<br />the classic item of my list I was a bit skeptical in the beginning<br />but at the end I was impressed by the way the author managed<br />to keep me reading to the last page.
B00DU74U74|5.0|The movie was better than I expected and really enjoyed the plot, characters and pace of the movie. Not sure how closely it followed book, but consider reading it after I enjoyed the movie.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|It  is interesting to look this list and see how many<br />books on kindle I carefully read and enjoyed. As<br />the others this contributed for my learning and also<br />to help me formatting my books to kindle. Much<br />appreciated.
B008LZHA3G|2.0|I have been a Dylan fan for many years and have nearly all of his early albums on vinyl.  The reviews of Tempest were generally excellent, so I thought it was a safe buy.  However, other than a couple of songs, Mr. Dylan sounds like he's bored with the whole project.  He drones on for nearly twice as long as many of the songs demand.  Sorry, I didn't really listen to the words, which is no doubt why the songs seem so long.  Guess that makes me a Philistine.  But, be warned that this album couldn't be described as musically lively or innovative.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|you should be able to rde more often.to have to keep buying gems or cons  makes t not fun.please make it more fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the story, got hooked when someone told me about the show, it pulled me into it and now I want more. The characters in the show do a wonderful job. Waiting for the new season!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really good and I like it better than temple run and subway surfers. I recommend this to pretty much everyone.
0446572993|5.0|The Innocent is another Baldacci success.  I got started with an audio book and have been hooked ever since.  I anxious;y await his next book.
B000SEI230|4.0|Very touching and inspiring.  A bit predictable, but the story did not need suspense or surprise. It was so sweet.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Very romantic and relevant. Reminds the viewer that you often have to wait to have a good thing. Excellent ending and explorers the difficult relationships between children and parents.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very excellent preview subway stations and is very educational<br />I believe that the creators she opp Ulf be very proud of themselves
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|Overall, the game has a good concept and a variety of puzzles. The authors did not program the touch events accurately however and playing the games gets very frustrating when the game registers your touches slightly off from where you actually touched the screen. In most games this doesn't affect play too badly but where accuracy counts (like squares), it quickly makes you not want to play. I got too frustrated by chapter six to want to continue, which is a shame because the puzzles were fun until squares ruined it.<br /><br />Basically, if you have big fingers like me... Good luck.
B003EVWDR0|3.0|The plot is an old but reworkable one, as well as one I am happy to see extended.<br />I am anxious to get a Blu-ray capable machine.<br />However, the dialogue is so stale and corny that I nearly stopped watching about 1/3 of the way through.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a fascinating read about the NDE, mostly because we have the view from an expert in brain function who can dismiss the critic's theories against NDE.  I found his ideas about the brain's functions enlightening and when viewed in light of his experience,  gave me much to reconsider about what I thought was true.  We seem to continually be pushing the border about what we know about the soul and our future as a species, and Eben Alexander has definitely made his contribution to the annals of Life after Death.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|A fun season for the viewer, if not always for the characters. Several of the plot points will too familiar in the sense of too similar to past elements. Others will feel too familiar in the sense of working over something again that's been worked over rather enough already. But there's much here to entertain and amuse. One hopes that the series ends before the writer is completely out of fresh ideas. But one will hate to see it go just the same.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|This is such a classic! I love this movie! All the singing and dancing it amazing and my kids really enjoyed it!
1609611543|5.0|Yes, but where can I guy wheat-free bread?  I can't cook where I live now (long story) and can find no wheat-free bread at the local grocer's.  Any suggestions?
B00CPLGGWS|5.0|This latest generation of APU chips from AMD provides stellar performance at a very reasonable price.  This APU was put into a new build desktop, for me, that is a Win 7 Home Premium unit with 16 gig of memory, a 120 gig SSD for the boot and software drive and a Seagate 2T hard drive for storage.  Very fast and very dependable.  The graphics with this APU look excellent on a 27&#34; monitor.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I ordered the Chromecast direct from Google within an hour of the announcement, and have been pleased with the product thus far. It is somewhat easier setting up and watching Netflix videos with Chromecast and a tablet than with the Wii, although on (effectively) single-tasking devices such as my iPad, switching back to the Netflix app to hit pause is somewhat less convenient.<br /><br />Setup was fairly quick, although I was surprised that you must switch your laptop (or other setup device's) wifi to the Chromecast's ad hoc wifi network briefly during setup to configure it, then switch back. No instructions were given on how to do this, so non-technical people may want to read up on wifi network configuration for the device you'll use for initial setup before you begin, and ensure you are running no downloads or other activities on that device requiring continuous wifi access while setting up your Chromecast.<br /><br />Although Google doesn't mention support for Linux, replicating a Chromium tab from Ubuntu to my Chromecast was seamless and worked perfectly. I also launched and watched Youtube videos from Ubuntu with no problem. I haven't tested Netflix yet, but plan to do so shortly.<br /><br />Happily, my original iPad (stuck at iOS 5) also works with no issues.<br /><br />I have 3 different Wi-Fi SSIDs, by the way (one for the cable modem, a separate router, and then a range extender), and devices controlling the Chromecast must be on the same SSID or wired to the device hosting the SSID to which the Chromecast is connected to control it. This won't affect many people, but it was puzzling at first when some devices \\"saw\\" the Chromecast and others didn't.<br /><br />Overall, despite the current rather limited video service support and slightly more complex than expected setup, I think Chromecast is a bargain and am pleased to have added it to our system.
B000ICM5O4|5.0|LOVE IT! Inspirational and magical. I feel myself in the music and I want Rocky to keep winning! Love you, Rock! And here is to you, Marciano!
0393343405|5.0|My wife and I read this book aloud. I sent a copy to my father who said he was riveted from the first page. We all agree that this is a seminal work of history that should be read by anyone who wants to know how great ideas are born, are suppressed, and are reborn. A story as good as any fiction told with style and assurance.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|awesome addictive riveting best series i have seen in long time- would highly recommend to a friend -and cannot wait to purchase season three
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|At first I was unsure how this game was going to flow, but the 3d graphics are spell binding and the fast paced action is both addictive and engaging.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and got it when it first came out back in 2007 unfortunately my dvd had gotten scratched and was unplayable so i decided to replace it with a collectors' set which i will enjoy forever &lt;3
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a lot of fun. Got it because we worked ourselves through 100 Floors and this looked just as good. It is! my only regret is that it does not have more levels. 10 is just not enough. Hopefully they are working on more.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game. It kept me hooked until the very end. Most of the hidden object games I find are very juvenile and boring, but not this one. Great graphics and fun spooky story.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Loved it, started off slow but once I got into it I couldn't put the book down!! Great read ever!!
1400052181|4.0|This is a great book. It teaches you aspects of medical history that the average person wouldn't know. I would recommend this book to teens and other readers as well.

0143118757|5.0|This book is very good. It provides you with insights and clear methods on how to conduct your negotiation. It works as a philosophy and it works in concrete negotiations. I can only recommend it as it will improve your mindset and skills in this area.<br />It is definitely worth the money.
0452285186|1.0|This was the most boring and humorless book ever &#34;drawn&#34;.  It was honestly not funny unless you can not read and rely only on cartoon characters for comprehension. Even then it still ridiculously NOT funny.
0374533555|5.0|I love this stuff. Kahneman does it really well in this book. He gives both valuable insights and some methods, which will improve your thinking. This book is worth the money.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|You know how you can usually predict what's going to happen next?  Well, not this show!  Each week is an incredible surprise and leaves you saying &#34;I didn't see that one coming&#34;.  Actors are terrific!  No wonder they keep garnering the awards!
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|A good summer movie, good fight scene and shoot 'en ups. Fun to watch. I would recommend it for a saturday afternoon.
B005IQZB14|2.0|I really didn't enjoy it.  If you are into hiking you may enjoy it but it was not my cup of tea.
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|nice details, one more for my  great collection.<br />A great buy for any person who loves superman collection thank you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are truly amazing and the game is hours of fun.<br />Lately I have not been able to log into Facebook with the kindle version, but<br />The android version no bugs I noticed. All around fantastic game.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really enjoyed this great story. Characters were all vividly described in both physical appearance and personality. By doing this well, anyone with at least a shred of imagination could build an incredible, ongoing scenery in their mind as they read. Great book. Recommended to many even prior to finishing!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Really Kool game to play a lot for my friends play this game. Could play this game all day if there was more hearts.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Krauss has put enormous effort into explaining most complicated  physics principles in a simplified manner so that a layperson of average intelligence can grasp an insight into the nature of the universe.  Thank you!!!

B00AHSGNJM|4.0|We own Finding Nemo on DVD, but we wanted to have it on the Kindle Fire HD for our 20 month-old. It was cheaper to buy it on amazon instant video than to buy a DVD combo with digital copy. The movie is HD when you play it out of your library on amazon instant video, HOWEVER, when you download it on your Kindle (to play without an internet connection) it is not played in HD and the color seems a little off. I don't care because I bought it for my 20 month-old who isn't bothered by it.
B007FIY3VW|4.0|I used the free version for awhile but could not read some Microsoft Word or Open Office documents I had on my computer. When I purchased the full version (for $0.99), I can seamlessly read all the word files I have generated over the years. It is well worth the value to be able to create on my computer and transfer to tablet or vice versa.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|This game has to many sync issues. Every time I turned around the game needed to sync.<br />I also felt I the game turned into a money scheme to make real progress you had to buy the animal or expansion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. I loved all of the new things after the update. I would recommend this game to everybody I know.
1936608898|5.0|This is an eye opener when it comes to the way food affects our bodies. I considered myself generally healthy and up to speed on how I should eat, but after reading this and trying the Whole30 myself, I have a new life. The book is easy to understand and pretty funny as well.
030746363X|3.0|I like this book. It is important to note that it is not hard science, but more an anecdotal exercise on what worked for the author.  I do appreciate that he has carried out lots of experiments on himself, but that does not constitute data.<br />The bit on sex is a little out of place in this book, but the basic message of upping protein and fat and lowering fast carb intake is sound advice.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a former nurse, I liked the medical \\"stuff\\".  I appreciated that he was honest that as a Doctor, he'd always previously discounted when patients described experiences like his... always pointing to physiological reasons. It is short, thus a \\"quick read.\\"  That being said, there is a lot to grasp and a lot to process.  I've already read it three times. I also appreciated his sharing of his \\"story\\" - - being adopted and his feelings about that, his significant family and their role in supporting him through this.......... the impact of this crisis on all his family.  I am just so grateful that I was exposed to this journey.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I absolutely love pinterest, but the app on my kindle fire hd keeps messing up. I've deleted it and reinstalled it twice but I only get to pin one thing before the little pop up that lets you select what board to put it on just refuses to come up. The app works perfect on my other devices so I don't know what the prob is.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Although the descriptive writing style is maintained in this novel, it didn't grab me as much as the previous two.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|It arrived on time and the price was right. This is my favorite Christmas movie. I don;t think Amazon should have a set  number of words as a requirement in feedback. Sometimes short and sweet says it all.
B001KZG99A|5.0|great movie for anyone into the Avenger series.<br /><br />Ironman is my favorite of these superheroes.<br /><br />I viewed the more recent Ironman before this..This tends to explain the origin.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Katy is open, honest about her marriage and humble about her origins.  Great music, of course!  Just a terrific movie all around!
B0007TKH66|2.0|I got it on time but the case the movie gose in is cracked I buy it new I would like to think it should be in good condition I mean I spend a good amount of money on seasons of a show so I can give my dad a.good gift now I have to give him a movie that looks damaged so I'm not happy at all
B008MM9630|4.0|Daughter and I love playing it together.  I like the fact that you can move things around and store them.
1451695195|2.0|It Seems to Me The Book Was more About The authors Accomplishments In The Medical Field And Didnt Speak A Whole Lot About The Things He Saw on The Other Side. Then He Has A Website That Talks about Reincarnation and All Sorts Of Things Beyond Just NDEs. Where Does Hell Fit Into The Equation? Nothing Is Said About hell. I Feel He Is Leading People down The Wrong Path. Didnt Have A Good Feeling After Reading The Book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is  fun game for kids to pass the time when on the road or in the dentist's office
B001XUPGLY|4.0|Classic Star Trek Film.  Another good Star Trek film.  What more can you say about Star Trek?  They are what they are!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|should require less money to play this game. not being able to buy equipment for the horse due to lack of money makes the game sucked.
B002ZBPPHA|3.0|Zombie-like critters.  Apocolyptic film.  Kind of interesting but also very odd. Could have been better, but it was okay. Average.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I read this book because it was referenced in Lean In.  I loved it!  I laughed out loud several times.  It was smart, funny and right on point.  Who says women aren't funny?
B00992CF6W|5.0|My boys 3 & 5 cannot put this game down and it's great because it goes with you.<br />Game does everything the real game does.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Alt-J seems to be making the rounds in commercials now, and they deserve the attention. I love this record! Like nothing else out there right now.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|it's a blue ray but takes forever to load on the player???<br />my son gets bored waiting for it to start.
B0068RQ85K|4.0|Great for making coils to saw into jump rings. They do not have measurements but they create nice and tight coils, perfect for sawing with a jewelers saw!
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|I like this game. But the full version is $3.99. That is way to expensive. I think that the price for the full version should cost less.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent game in the fashion of myst, but I wish that it was longer. It is challenging without being to difficult to figure out. Looking forward to future installments of this game.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I love this app because it lets you create your own music. Great app. Trust me. You won't be disappointed.
B005UG542S|5.0|Thought the writers did superb job tying up all the story details.  Was especially gratified that Hogworts played such a big part in the finish.  As it did in the beginning..  The kind of ending you hope for in a movie like this,  the characters that have struggled for so long against heavy odds triumph in the end.  Very gratifying.  The greatest thing about the three main characters is that if they weren't entangled in all the adversity, they would be normal people living normal lives.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you wanted to know of who you are. And who is your Father in Heaven, I would tell you trust and believe that God is real. I dare you to chanegllen yourself your soul, your heart.  Give it to Jesus Christ Lord of All the Earth.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|Seemed to me that the story development was a little sluggish in this segment.  The whole thing could have been wrapped up in a more compact time frame.  But the same could be said for the books as well.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I tried this app and it works well. ONLY WITH HP. Not a universal print app. Prints attachments well. Highly recommend this app.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This is a bittersweet, sexy comedy that portrays many different relationships and types of love from perspectives that vary depending on the age and experience of each character, and there are no weak links in this cast, including the adolescents. This movie is extremely entertaining; an instant classic that one can watch repeatedly and find something new every time. Highly recommended!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thought that the Kite Runner was an outstanding novel by Hosseini; however, I could not put this novel down.  The character development was captivating and he carefully meshed the characters at the end. I would highly recommend this book.
B0001MLMKY|4.0|This watch is similar to a swatch I had about ten years ago and loved.  I would say it is a unisex watch as it is larger in size which is what I wanted.  Overall, I am happy with this purchase.
1490313370|5.0|I dont think I have ever read a book with more value per word than James Altucher's Choose Yourself.  I got through the entire book in just a few days, as it was very hard to put down.  Motivational, very funny, insightful, and full of great ideas.  I am an avid reader, and there are very few books I have read in my life that I can say they truly changed my life for the better-but this one did.  I give it my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Tom Berchou
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The only reason that  I gave it 4 stars is the loading issues that I've been having! THE GAME ITSELF IS AWESOME!
B009GED3HS|3.0|There were too many filler episodes. Not all episodes were the level of funny I am used to getting from this great show. However, there were a few key episodes that were pretty funny.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Entertaining and you can leave it alone, come back and they're all growled up! Seek out your favourite dinos and you will find your way!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed the movie. I think not reading the book ahead of time may have explained our constant confusion during the first half of the movie until the story line unfolded. I would recommend it though.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show the characters are great and drama keeps begging for more. This is my second love to watch after Dawton Abbey.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I thought this was a very entertaining twist on the old Jack and the beanstalk story. Probably my favorite version to date. Worth a watch.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day, I was so happy. Even worth $1.99. I play this game online and now I can play it on my kindle fire. I completed all 44 levels and I'm going to go back and play all 44 levels over again.
B001NTLYKC|5.0|After hearing a new millenium jam band do a respectable cover of &#34;Don't Need No Doctor&#34;, I bought this on a whim for my classic rock lovin' husband. Featuring Peter Frampton before he was Peter Frampton, this collection will have you waving your bic lighter in the air.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun.  Challenges get tough, but you don't have to buy in app.purchases to enjoy. Just keep on running! Fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Downton Abbey is a totally enjoyable experience;  however, the viewer must be warned that this program is addictive, leading to anticipation of future seasons.
1476712042|4.0|Beautiful Disaster is just the book I needed to read when I was having a bad day. Abby had a terrible childhood because of her father and now she is trying to be free of her past. Right away she runs right into the person she would be with if she didn't move on from her past. The one thing I really liked about Abby is that she was strong about staying away from her past, when she had her way out from helping her father she used it.<br />It was refreshing to see that even though Abby and Travis obviously had feelings for one another, it wasn't rushed like a lot of books that I have read in the past. They became best friends and then went from there.<br />Abby had the best friend in the world with America. She knew about her past and helped her with her true identity. While she played both sides of liking or hating Travis, she always did what was best for Abby. Even if Shepley didn't agree, which I really loved how she stood up to him. Today there are not a lot of people who would choose their best friend in every situation, but America did.<br />There is one thing that I really hated about the book; how Travis wanted to beat any guy who talked to Abby or looked at her the wrong way. I hate how men think that they own a person if they are dating. Newsflash, we hate it! We can protect ourselves. Woman are not helpless!! (The only time I approved was with Ethan the second time around!!)<br />In the end, I am rating this book with 4 stars and I plan on reading Walking Disaster next. From the ending of Beautiful Disaster, I am hoping that there will be at least one more book to complete the story. The little 5 page Valentine's Day expert thingy was not enough! :)
B001VFTYWI|4.0|There are many factual information tidbits in this work of fiction.  I found the workings of the medical community in tandem with the law enforcement officials very interesting.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Very good book such an amazing story. She is an amazing women so sad what so had to go through.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|When I first downloaded this it did not work, but then it updated itself and I really like it. It's funny and fun.
B002ZG997M|5.0|This movie surprised me, because I did not know what to expect.  It was dramatic, suspenseful and stirred up many emotions and thoughts.  It was an amazing, attention grabbing, emotional film.  The acting and actors can only be called superb!
B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere back in time is my favorite maiden album for many reasons. First every song on the album I can listen to and enjoy listening too. I like the time theme of the album (caught somewhere in time, wasted years, alexander the great, deja vu, etc.) I like the synth but glad they didn't overdue it like I felt the did a little bit on seventh son. Adrian Smith is unbelievable and I felt Bruce was at his best vocally on this album.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|ITS SO REAL YOU WONT EVEN KNOW IT WAS ON A TABLET OR AN IPHONE OR ON ANYTHING ITS THAT COOL. I looked at this game like whats this?

B00CDY6HW6|5.0|This is a very fun game. I noticed it was the free app of the day and decided to give it a try. If you have ever played penguin this is very much like it.
0062255657|5.0|Great book. If you enjoyed Anansi Boys or American Gods, this one will be a great followup. Quicker read than some of his other novels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a fun ga me and i reccomend getting it. yeah, now im just trying to take up word space.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It looks like there is no ads shown if I play the video with Chromecast.<br />It is a good buy.
B0036MDN80|5.0|For its small size, this is an incredibly lifelike representation of a mother tiger and her cub. It's listed as a toy, no doubt because it is made of plastic rather than porcelain or some other classic artists' materials, but this may also be why it is able to achieve such credible coloring. The detail is beyond expectation.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|The show was dark and moody at the beginning with a transition into conflict and then into resolution and light. Loved the energy of the show. Was up front and M looked amazing of course.  Unforgettable experience!  Buy it now!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Book 1 was truly outstanding.  Book 2 is merely outstanding. Ken Follett continues to sparkle and prove he's the best in the business today.  Book 2 picks up with the next generation and takes us through WW II.  Wrapped in Follett's words, I was there in each of the locations sharing the events he described.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and it was free it is awesome I love it a must have of apps. Cute sound effects and music my whole family loves the Minions and &quot;Despicable Me&quot;. I love it.
B0071MQBX0|4.0|Can the crew of the Enterprise travel back in time to the 20th century and retrieve a pair of humpback whales to communicate with an alien probe that threatens the existence of Earth in the 23rd century? Of course they can, with ingenuity, panache and comedic determination that rivals the best \\"Star Trek\\" episodes of the fabled original series. It's a voyage that shouldn't be missed, and like \\"Wrath of Khan\\" it's a movie that stands on its own as great entertainment.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I found that i thought of Buck as a man, not a dog. The story is well written and i enjoyed reading it.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This was different from Paul's usual music but different and very relaxing and soothing to listen to so I enjoyed its uniqueness.
0671004107|2.0|Terribly written book - it is as if Carl Sagan is trying to talk down to his mortal reader in a very pompous fashion.  Congrats, Carl, you're a walking thesaurus.<br /><br />The plot is intriguing, but it's constantly interrupted by pages upon pages of pointless narrative.  Stuff that does absolutely nothing to forward the story line or character development.  1/2 a chapter to introduce a character by talking about his involvement in historical Russian politics?  How exactly does that tell me anything about how this character relates to the present?  How dull.<br /><br />Also, it's ironic how Sagan banters on and on about how religious faith is a farce, but yet the premise of the book is about extra terrestrials.  Wow...so God is cooky and childish but believing in ETs isn't?  Huh.  Because we all know how much evidence there is to support intelligent life on other worlds...oh right it's all just a construct of probability with nothing to support it.  But faith, now there's a waste of time!  Genius...I expected something a bit more sophisticated out such a brilliant and rational mind.  A passable author does not scientific genius make.<br /><br />Frankly, the overwhelming good reviews that this book receives is probably because of the name attached to it.  People love Carl Sagan, therefore people love Carl Sagan's books.  I love science - I study optical physics for a living - and this book is one of the most disappointing I have read to date.  Carl Sagan or not, this needs an abridged version, wherein about 25% of the entire text is cut out and thrown into a fire; now that would be a much more interesting read.  This is what happens when Dan Brown overcompensates for his literary failure as an author.<br /><br />Contact = fail.  Good try, but fail.
B00CW665VI|5.0|it's a book to read over and over again, and this is only author first work, cant wait for others. reading things from male perspective gave me laugh of my life. seriusly couldn't put the thing down until I read it whole. and it was refreshing to read something that didnt involve some damage characters, two people put is some comical situation.... very refreshing and amusing, excellent work!!!!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Okay, I have to admit, Chris Hemsley is totally eye candy (yum!), and that's half the reason I watched this, but I was so blown away by how much fun this movie was!  Great effects, and good storyline.  I would definitely recommend this as a good Saturday night movie for the family (maybe not the very wee ones).
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I couldn't resist getting the book that Fox News interjected itself into controversy, to learn for myself what all the bugaboo was about. After getting thru the first chapters I was convinced the detractors of this author are invoking pure animus toward the author while ignoring the merits of the book. Being a former catholic and one who has studied biblical exegesis and theology, I conclude the book is a legitimate socio-historic treatment of the subject. In fact it covers material that would be quite familiar to any New Testament exegetical scholar. Any catholic (Roman, Anglican, Orthodox, Lutheran) would likely be right at home with the material. This is not a theological, dogmatic catechism. It's a very interesting treatise that does precisely what the author set out to do - provide a glimpse into the life and times of the historical Jesus, his impact, and place in history as a historical figure.<br /><br />I highly recommend the work to anyone who is interested in the study of the formation of religions and in particular, the one related to a Jewish man named Yeshua. I would dare to say, had the author submitted this, it would receive an Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur from the Catholic Church.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I have loved this series from the beginning.  I remember first watching it and thinking I really shouldn't like this show because of it's content and storyline, but there were parts that were pretty humorous and I have been watching it since. I've watched every season and sad to see it end with season 8 but I guess it can't keep going on because these story lines and characters always get caught eventually.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game...its so fun but challenging at the same time. my whole family is addicted. the only issue I have had with it is it likes to freeze and crash sometimes (at the worst times when we beat a high score) I hope the update fixed that...if it would ever download!
B008CP93S0|3.0|It was ok, not great but it did have it's moments of humor.  I can't really remember the movie because it wasn't one that sticks out in my mind.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|If you're contemplating on whether or not you want to buy this album, don't! You must purchase this album, it's dark and incredibly sexy. The two songs to really listen to are Flawless and WDYWFM, buy it, listen to it and love it!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I really liked this movie, it was fun, a little romantic and showed sites of India.  I really lik all the actors and actresses in it and that is what drew me in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is sooo cool bcuz it changes the cities like every month. And each player gets different clothes .
B00CM9JKXU|5.0|So, to be fair, I bought both Frequency Unknown (F.U. hard to miss the intention there) and Queensryche (2013) and listened to them back to back. Didn't know what the new singer would do and thought it was only fair to listen to Geoff Tate's current vision of Queensryche to see if it was good or not. In the battle of Queensryche vs. Queensryche, La Torre wins hands down. This is probably the best Queensryche album since Hear in the Now Frontier. The classic Maiden-esque sound of Queensryche that is pretty much completely missing from Tate's version is alive and well on this album. While I admit to being a somewhat late arrival at the Queensryche party (started listening to them at Operation: Mindcrime) I have been a fan of the band for over 20 years and truth be told, they had gotten a bit weak with Tate on vocals in the last ferw years. Other than a decent covers album it had been a steady decline since Q2K with some bright spots along the way. La Torre has infused some fresh blood and seemingly new life into the band. I look forward to seeing the next album from the band. For long time fans, I recommend buyinjg both albums and deciding for yourself. Personally, I think Geoff Tate should not release any more Queensryche albums unlesss he gets back into the actual band. The sound isn't there and he is well enough established as a singer to release records under his own name.
B007SGM084|5.0|My favorite book of all time!!! It's my therapy. Lol Christian Grey is an amazing character. Can't wait for the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love playing this game. Its fun to do and I'm bored it gives me something to do. That's just how I feel about this game
B005UG542S|5.0|Awesome series! I truly enjoyed watching this series with my grown daughter who grew up watching them. I highly recommend it!
B0012DK4ZU|5.0|I first saw this classic at a theater and was really creeped out by it. It turned up on the commercial filled late night TV which I won't watch. Finally found the VHS and watched it faithfully over the years. This is one creepy, weird and horrifically terrifying film. It's watching a nightmare. One the creepiest films of all time. It doesn't let up. Sure it's dated but that is not drawback at all. If you like Gothic horror I recommend Phantasm.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Awesome series! I truly enjoyed watching this series with my grown daughter who grew up watching them. I highly recommend it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its challenging and entertaining great for kids or adults looking for some entertainment really great game and works without internet!!!
B00271DNP4|5.0|Awesome series! I truly enjoyed watching this series with my grown daughter who grew up watching them. I highly recommend it!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very addictive and challenging. I wish you didn't have to pay for the rest of the game though. Still a great game.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Awesome series! I truly enjoyed watching this series with my grown daughter who grew up watching them. I highly recommend it!
B008KE3960|5.0|I've always liked the tower defense games.  This takes it to a new level where not just strategy but skill are required.  A lot of fun!
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Awesome Series! I really enjoyed watching these for the first time with my grown daughter who grew up watching them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is great because it is easy to use...big numbers help my aging eyes...I would definitely recommend it...life is hard enough take the easy when it is offered
B002MQYOFW|1.0|This book was full of surprises and a wonderful mix of romance and action. This is by far the best book I have ever read
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a super fun game in a good way to kill time also people of all ages can play. Worthy of downloading.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Now I really enjoyed this youtube alot.  It is just like the regular tube. Love it. Use this app all the time.<br />.
B0052U6ORQ|5.0|I usually wear 9.5's and the 9 fits me just right.<br /><br />I run around 20 miles per week in these shoes, and ran (and trained for) a marathon in them.  They performed extremely well.  Due to my gait and uneven wear, i end up needing to replace them every six months or so (mind you, that's hundreds of miles run).<br /><br />I have one toe (my second toe) which bumps up against the top/front of the shoe too much, and leaves my toenail a little bruised and unhappy sometimes, but i think that's probably just my foot shape and gait.<br /><br />I also wear these shoes hiking, and get great results.  My feet feel connected to the ground, and balanced.  Yes, if you step on something sharp, like a broken root or a plum-sized rock, it will hurt a little more than with big soles, but it won't injure you.  If you're not paying enough attention to the trail to avoid big things that are sticking up, then you'd probably trip on it regardless.<br /><br />I have worn nothing but these shoes (and sometimes 5-fingers) while running for the past few years.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It was was okay. Really did not like it much. Took it off my kindle and downloaded tubemate and found that to be a better youtube.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|Some parts were slow moving but not bad.  Good Action, villan was great!  Again, good triumphs over evil.  Worth seeing.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Excellent App that performs as described. Cannot think of any reason not to add this one to a Kindle Fire library.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|I got my CD within just a couple of days and it was just as described.  The packaging was very neat and tidy as well.  Very pleased--thank you!
0061353248|3.0|Ariely telling stories about his research comes through mostly well, though it is clear from his comfort level in writing this way that this is not his true style.  Everyone wants to be Malcolm Gladwell, it seems.  Ariely isn't Gladwell.  But it is clear that he is passionate about his work.  Too much so at times, and when he lectures about how public policy should be implemented, it takes away from how good this book could have been.<br /><br />I wondered about his economics credentials when he lectured about how the government should make various aspects of health care &#34;free.&#34;  I was immediately curious if he would be willing to provide his book for free if the government deemed it important.  Since I had to give him money for the book, I'm guessing the answer to be &#34;no.&#34;<br /><br />Still, the premise of the book is that the classic economics theory that human decisions are made rationally is flawed comes through well.  Clearly some decisions are made rationally, but there are interesting cases where that rational nature is not dominant, and that comes through in his stories of his research.<br /><br />It is a book worth reading, and I do believe that I accomplished my goal of learning something by reading it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun game I have enjoyed playing it for hours. I would like to see more levels because that is the only down fall I found with this game
B00127RAJY|2.0|I order mine and i can not play it because of this&#34; region code&#34; apparently in different parts of the world you cant play the same DVD's for whatever reason... Sorry this isnt scientific but im not sure why all's i know is if i change the code on my computer and change it back i can only do this a total of 4 times before you computer will no longer allow you to change the code... not worth it i hope amazon takes it back.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I started and finished this book all in day. My hands wouldn't allow me to put  the book down before finding out how it panned out. It was happy and sad but not  a bad pissed off sad that ruins the book the author turned the sadness... never mind I can't find the right words just read the book for yourself you won't regret it
1623150825|1.0|It was basically a review of the book and contained no meaningful information. i thought I was purchasing a book containing some skill sets I could use for self improvement.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|The Bat is the first in Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole series of murder mysteries, and also the first I've read.  It's a little weird to begin a Norwegian series in Australia, but why not?  I found it engaging and frequently surprising.  It's also quite dark.  I look forward to reading the many additional titles in this series.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love all the angry birds. But I must say that this is so far my favorite. Even though I'm not a star wars fan I really enjoy this game. Hope they keep making more Angry Birds.
1781162646|5.0|This was something different from the King of horror novels, but have to say that I loved it.....it was a really fast read, I didn't stop until it was over and total time was about a day. I highly recommend this book, I really enjoyed the characters and the story!
0800141660|5.0|Great for women to watch together, there is so much to enjoy. The music, acting, and scenery are quality. This is a good one for maturing young women as lessons and values shine through this film very beautifully.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great piece of history with solid characters. Learned a lot about that era and how evil some people could be and how heroic some men and women were to defeat it.
B000TGRM1A|3.0|Risk is to Megadeth as the Load/Reload sessions are to Metallica: a foray into shallow radio rock. Fortunately, this did not bring about a continuing trend in Megadeth's music, though, returning to grace with The World Needs a Hero and continuing to today. I had to ratchet down my rating due to the three, utterly-unnecessary techno remixes tacked onto the end and the repetitive and bothersome \\"Insomnia,\\" but that's not to say the album was a total bust. \\"Prince of Darkness\\" and \\"Crush 'Em,\\" while stilted, do have a redeeming amount of Megadeth's classic attitude, while more ambitious tracks like the blues-inflected \\"Breadline,\\" the somewhat jazzy, soulful, almost Motown vibe of \\"I'll Be There,\\" and the appropriately-meandering \\"Wanderlust\\" are all unusual to hear from a band known from day one for their rage, but in the long run, have their places in the pantheon of anthemic Megadeth works. Overall, one can get Risk's market impact and strongest single with \\"Crush 'Em,\\" but the album s worth purchase when on sale to tuck away in one's collection as rainy day backup Megadeth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun it gets very addicting. You never know when a new thing is going to pop up and its very interesting.
B000RLHDUM|4.0|Pierce Brosnan does some of his best work here as a bored Wall Street money man who gets some of his kicks by stealing and returning priceless works of art. Rene Russo also delivers a fascinating performance a very smart and sexy insurance investigator. The love affair between these characters is full of ups and downs, reflecting their very flawed individual natures.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|If you are like me, this film came and went through theatrical release without the slightest notice.  Never even saw a preview or a promo.  Probably says more about me than it says about the film, since there are more than ten times the number of reviews I expected to see (ten TIMES, not ten more), so obviously this film is generating some well-deserved buzz.<br /><br />I stumbled on this island of brilliance while wading through oceans of dreck on our local Redbox machine.  The title piqued my interest, as did the participation of two Wachowski siblings.  That was pretty much all I knew about it, so I'm about as close as you might find to a \\"virgin\\" viewer.<br /><br />I pity (if not fear for) anyone who was not moved by the tremendous currents of humanity (as in, humaneness) coursing throughout the film.  Yes, the numerous plot lines can be a bit confusing, and the future-dialect of Hanks & Barry & Sarandon is difficult to follow (try turning on subtitles?).  I also thought Hugo Weaving as Hanks' \\"demon\\" conscience (for lack of a better descriptive term) was rather obtusely introduced and depicted in cringe-inducing fashion.  Perhaps this was precisely the point, and you certainly can't fault Weaving for throwing himself into the role with his trademark zeal.<br /><br />Still, the ensemble cast is impressive for essentially the entire film, even though it can be a bit distracting (e.g., is that Jim Broadbent AGAIN?).  Honestly, the performances are tremendous -- I never once felt an actor or actress was out of their depth (although Doona Bae as an aging Latina sweatshop owner was too much of a reach -- and a waste of make-up!).  Jim Broadbent's escapades in trying to escape a prison-like retirement community had me in unexpected hysterics -- no mean feat.<br /><br />The prevailing theme, explored in myriad ways, is the unfolding tension between two competing world-views:  one, a crude oversimplification of the Nietzschean saw that \\"the weak are meat,\\" which \\"the strong do eat.\\"  The other, that love is eternal, and the consequences of our actions -- particularly those that are noble or selfless -- ripple into eternity.  The vagaries of human behavior are on full display here, from the most heinous and base to the most inspired and inspirational.<br /><br />I never once felt bored or distracted through the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes, even though I was expecting something much shorter (I had it in my head that it was 1 hour 40 minutes long, for unknown reason).  Quite frankly, I didn't want it to end, or I wish they incorporated even more.<br /><br />Edifying cinematic experiences like this are far too few, so I intend to savor Cloud Atlas through my memory -- and periodic future viewings -- for the rest of my life.  Bravo! Encore!rong do eat.\\"  The other, that love is eternal, and the consequences of our actions -- particularly those that are noble or selfless -- ripple into eternity.

B0073LWEXK|1.0|This game did not work properly on my Kindle Fire. It was very hard to navigate and it freezes up. I'm going to delete it. And I will not purchase anything else from the makers! I'm very disappointed!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I would have given this a five star review except that I made it through all the levels in about a day. There are infinite possibilities, I just wish there was more... Or a scoring system based on time or moves or something. The replayability is very limited currently.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's so rare that I pick up a book and discover something that takes me by surprise and that I can't put down.  One of my friends talked highly of the Wool series and I decided to buy it as an eBook to carry with me and explore during travel down-time.  I read the first chapter after download and simply couldn't put it down.  I just burned through the entire Wool series and bought the next two releases in the series.  Way to go Hugh!  These are brilliantly written -- simple, clever, addictive... perfect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great get your kids playing.They are going to like it .Mincraft style .so much fun best game in the world get it! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0452295548|5.0|Two good friends, unknown to each other, recommend this book to me.  One loaned me her copy.  Both of them were very enthusiastic.  When I finished reading it, I ordered one for myself because I found it so insightful and wanted to loan it to others!  It is a fascinating glimpse at how our brain works and also a story of extreme courage.  I highly recommend it!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game. But it froze on me &amp; I finally had to take it off and put it back on &amp; start all over.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Although nothing can compare to the big screen, this DVD is a must own for all fans of the musical.  Jackman and the rest of the cast bring the music to life and the story can't be beat.
B0095EMOTM|4.0|I really enjoy this CD, but gave it four starts instead of five stars as there are a couple songs I don't care for.
0547258305|5.0|Graceling is probably one of my favorite books. I love the world of graceling where people have special abilities and different colors eye.  So like X-Men which I also love.  Katsa is awesome with her graced fighting abilities. She's independent, strong, rough around the edges but also very caring and protective. You see her grow into her power and using it to help others. And the relationship and love that grows between her and Po is so sweet. You cannot help but fall in  love Po while reading this book. He is so perfect for Katsa.  Also graced and her well matched fighting partner. The bond and love the grows between is beautiful to read, touching and endearing. It will pull at your heartstring. A well written fantasy book with a good plot and well paced. Action from beginning to end with good fighting scenes. My only complaint would be that the confrontation with the villain ended too quickly. All the anticipation and then it was over abruptly. It should have been dragged out more. Otherwise, well worth the read. A book I will definitely read more than once and one I would recommend to both teens and adults.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I really like this CD, and easy listening so can play the CD in the car, going off to sleep.

B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|plot was intriguing, but story line seems rushed. I would imagine it was a movie made from the hype of a book. I just wish they took more time to play it out.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|If you hang in there for the first 30 minutes while they set things up it is worth the rest of the ride.  It is a mind moving experience.  Very powerful and thought provoking

B0087HT36U|3.0|Fun game. There are a couple of levels that are impossible to finnish due to delay.five stars without the forced rating.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Just starting to play this game. It looks like it takes awhile to get gems. I guess I could go and buy some, but this is a good way to teach budget skills and teach that it's ok to have to wait. If you (or someone you know) is interested in getting a horse, this is a good (and humane ) way to see if they could handle the responsibility of taking care of an animal.  Will write more after playing it for awhile.
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|If you enjoy Wagner, you can't miss this album. You have to put up with some creaky sound at times, but the performances make it more than worth it. There are no singers around today that can compare.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this book. It took me 2 years at my friend's insistence to read it in the first place, but I sure am glad I did. Easily one of the best series I have read.<br /><br />Beware! Once you start, it is very very hard to quit. :)
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|It's a beautiful movie for children.It's very charming...better than any of the old 'fairy tales', and delightful enough for adults to<br />watch.
B00CW665VI|4.0|This was a fun read and enjoyable.  Not sure why they require so many words when you write a review . . .
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The book described how people that Harold met also had problems.  He was more able to accept his having lost his son and unhappy marriage knowing that others also had family difficulties.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I am grateful for this woman who shares her experience in her own words with out trying to tell others what to conclude or believe.  Yes, she gives her opinion and her own interpretation of life and death, as each one of us has the freedom to express.  I found her life experience very interesting as she was exposed to three different faiths as a child and each contributes to her view of life.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Well $35 - ~$28 = $7 with netflix subscription. Amazing price for Youtube and netflix streaming. Chrome Tab Casting is good but it is letterboxed which makes for a sub-optimal experience.<br /><br />But well worth the money and as more apps come online, it will be very useful.<br /><br />I recommend it.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|After reading nearly all of the writer's books over the past many years,I was disappointed with this latest book.<br />There was too much disjointed writing and going to and fro in both time and characters...

B007XNAOS0|5.0|Though I only discovered Baroness via this album, I can say with confidence that it is destined to become a classic. Runs the gamut from almost ambient acoustic beauties to hard rockin' metal riffage and tight guitar harmonies.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game itself is a more varied version of Temple Run with sections of different camera angles, boss battles, slide zones and more. It is a fair bit more difficult than Temple Run and upgrades are harder to get. Would give it 5 stars but on my LG Optimus Pad it doesn't register the first touch action in each game and all through the game touch response lags just a couple of milliseconds, enough to get you killed in crunch situations.
0385349947|5.0|This book was very inspiring, animated and really pulled me in. I could relate to many of the chapters, and it helped drive conversations at the office that typically doesn't happen between women...turning a negative into a positive!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I would recommend this for every high school and college student studying the civil war era, and anyone with even a passing interest in history.  A great book, well paced, perfectly detailed.  After reading it, I want to see the movie again to see all of the things I missed the first time.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Great read beginning to end. Every bit as interesting nd specil as the hunger games. Love the ending which leaves the author wide open for a sequel!!

B000NY12LO|5.0|I am no literary critic but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I have read almost all of Ms. Picoult's books and find that each one addresses an important social or ethical/moral issue.  This particular book helped me better understand why a teenager or young adult would be likely to go on a shooting rampage with people all around having no clue what is going on in their lives.  It saddens me that some parents aren't more involved and aware of what goes on in their children's lives.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|Great little device - boosts sound nicely and tiny and light weight as well.  My wife and I use a splitter to simultaneously listen to audiobooks while on public transportation.  I need a boost of volume, especially on noisy bus or train.  This works well, and I can use it before the splitter, or after the splitter only on my earbud side.  Used for hours, and haven't needed to recharge yet.  Initial charge was easy via USB cable [included]. A worthwhile purchase.  I would have liked a passthrough so can keep it connected even if I didn't need the boost, but it must be on when it is in line.  Also would have liked a little more boost. Therefore only 4 of 5 stars, but it is worth the money.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I grew tired in the first 10% of the \\"F\\" word and her soft porn thoughts. I am sorry for her loss but I thought I was getting an exciting adventure on the PCT, not mixed up sexual attitudes. I could have done without the graphic descriptions. Returned for a refund.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is a blast and with big being free that makes it even better! I played it shortly after downloading it, but when I went to open it the day after it wouldn't load. Not sure what the problem is. I've unloaded and download it again but no change. Not sure where to go from here.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book, it was one of the best books I have ever read.  I didn't want it to end.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Like a lot of people i had only seen the movie and decided to switch it up. The movie had a few changes from the book. some i liked more than others but all in all i think they break even
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Really liked the old version better. This upgrade is actually a downgrade with stock photo. Hopefully the next upgrade will happen soon and actually be better.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|surprisingly  very good  alot of  artists  have trouble coming back  w new albums  they had no problem very good sweet album
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie is a must see; it explains (thoroughly) everything you should know about what you're putting in your body.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|I listened to this CD about 6 times all the way through, and i like it mainly because it consist of metal SONGS. I would say if you are a Megadeth fan, it's safe to buy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it's a good game because the movie awesome so it's ok.I like to defeat Vickers  and the other ones.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Call me biased, but any album by the re-united members of Black Sabbath is just beyond reproach. There are no Paranoid's on there, the all time classic that will last for ever. But well worth the wait and great listen.<br />I will be seeing them live in Manchester UK in December 2013 and am counting down the days.<br />If you like Black Sabbath buy it. If you like heavy rock you will not be disappointed. The boys are back together and on form.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|:)<br /><br />Good read and narration. Looking forward to next one.<br />Narrator was pleasant and easy. Glad it was a free book.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Outstanding! I wish I had read this book sooner. I will read it over and over again. I will have my children read it as well when they become of age.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because there are different countries to go to. I love how creative the game is. P.S I love the little puppy. THIS IS A FUDGEN AWSOME GAME.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Fun game. Sometimes awkward to control, though not often. Campaign was good.<br />Biggest complaint is that its a battery hog.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is one of the best on my kindle. I think that it could use some things that the original mine craft has though...
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the puzzles and it is fun. The only problem is that the app will stop working while doing a puzzle and you have to start all over. Very annoying.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I really like this game and I have played a few diff Dragon games and I would say this one is the best so far. I am glad I found this game.
B008220AVW|5.0|Love it. Favorite movie ever ever. Love Katy. Every one should buy this DVD. Seriously. You'll all love it. -- peace and love
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! It is one of my favorite games on my kindle fire I personally like creative a lot better than survival mode I highly suggest that you get this game it's AWESOME!!!!!!!! :)
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It was a great read.  The story was sweet yet suspenseful and at times a little scary.<br />Ok  I would recommend highly.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|It's very good. Some people complain that full version is $10 but an 3DS game cost like $30 and has as much as this game has. I only gave it four stars since I can't play multiplayer on my Kindle Fire.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This pack went through a pretty tough test when I climbed Blue Mountain in the Adirondacks. In it was my Nikon D7000, three lenses, a mic, and accessories. It was comfy the whole way up. Right as we reached the peak, we got stuck in a downpour. We were drenched, and I was super worried about my camera gear. I didn't check on it until we got out of the rain, and all my gear was dry. The inside of the pack was starting to get a little damp, but I let it air out and it dried in a few hours.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a game of very little cost and so good i lend it to my son and he are so happy
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|The sixth studio album from melodic metalcore pioneers Killswitch Engage finds the band returning to form. This involves Jesse Leach, the band's initial and one-time lead singer, returning to the fold for the first time since the group's watershed-worthy sophomoric 2002 effort, \\"Alive Or Just Breathing.\\" Therefore, the effort, entitled \\"Disarm The Descent,\\" makes fans of ex-frontman Howard Jones think twice before saying that that frontman had the better pair of pipes. (Leach's are every bit as accomplished and dynamic. They are plenty soulful, too.) And plus, KsE arrive at the corner of some instrumental growth throughout the record, too. In addition to conjuring up another batch of amazing riffage (some of the best of their career!), six-stringers Adam Dutkiewicz and Joel Stroetzel write and pull-off a handful of emphatic guitar solos, and do so to surprisingly successful effect.<br /><br />The record opens with a fairly prototypical Killswitch epic. \\"The Hell In Me\\" kicks off with a hardcore-derived bellow of \\"go!\\" followed by a sparks-spitting deluge of furious, At The Gates-styled riffing and punishing blast beats. This, then, flows perfectly into the tunes melodic choruses, which are so soulful and sweet that they put Soilwork to shame (and even rival the works of vintage Opeth). A brief but nice acoustic intro enters the fray near the end of the track, but a scorching pick slide ensues soon thereafter, thus bringing the bullying thrash back in all of its glory. \\"Disarm\\"'s trio of singles (\\"Beyond The Flames,\\" \\"In Due Time,\\" and \\"Turning Point\\"), are, naturally, three other standout-worthy tracks. The first of the bunch boasts a familiarly catchy and fiery thrash gallop comprised of hot thrash licks and tight, precise, and bruising drums. But the song, of course, makes room for plenty of deliciously clean crooning, cooing. And its melodic choruses are huge enough that they require their own zip code, too! The second song of the bunch is another extraordinarilyinfectious number that balances blowtorch riffs with more soulful and sweet vocal harmonies. And the very respectable guitar solo (which is very steep and mazy) that is uncorked, here, seems like just the icing on the cake. And lastly, a somber, minor-key melody introduces the final song in the above-named batch. But the rest of the band storm onto the scene with some really, really thunderous riffs and beats. They also uncork another memorable and ripping guitar solo, here, as well -- but this one differs from the ones heard on the rest of the record in that it is surprisingly technical.<br /><br />Elsewhere, there is an increased hardcore-mentality present on some of the other tracks. Take \\"The New Awakening,\\" for example. Its distinctly hardcore mentality, straight-forward, heads-down chugging, and tough guy-sounding vocal patterns would not be out of place on a Bury Your Dead joint. The song differs from that band's, however, on account of it featuring some nice guitar harmonies (which help to further its melodic choruses, and make them even more memorable). And it also is highlighted by another guitar solo -- tasty, fiery, and ripping, this just might be KsE's best solo to date! And plus, a track like \\"A Tribute To The Fallen\\" sounds similar, as it adopts a heavy hardcore fervor, and is mainly centered around head-banging, pit-stoking, lock-step-unison rhythms and crunching riffs. But in a nod to the band's metal roots, \\"Tribute\\" also lets another very respectable solo fly.<br /><br />\\"All We Have\\" is another album highlight, as it is a thunderous and bullying, hardcore-influenced bruisers with whiplash tempo'ing, blasting, and thrash beats that segue into deliciously melodic, harmonic-guitar-aided choruses. The song is also noteworthy for featuring some positively, uh, positive lyrics from Jesse (Leach supply sings lines like \\"forgiveness is all we have\\"). Another equally as memorable cut is \\"You Don't Bleed For Me,\\" which features one of the album's best andmost infectious choruses (and when you consider the competition that it is up against, that is REALLY saying something!). And they are all surrounded by more fiery, bone-crunching guitar chugging and bashing skins. But the following song, \\"The Call,\\" is even more of a standout because it reaches near black/death metal ferocities and intensities complete with scalding, machine gun riffing, and walloping drum blasts. (The drumming is of particular note, here, as it reaches almost mind-boggling levels of hyper-kinesis at times.)<br /><br />Finally, there is one last group of songs, every one of them very good. \\"No End In Sight\\" offsets nastily chugging, abrasively grinding, Pantera-worthy chugging thrash/groove metal riffs with a hook-heavy, harmonic chorus that wouldn't sound out of place coming from the likes of Stone Sour. Killswitch Engage then proceed to flesh out their melodic muscle on the subsequent \\"Always,\\" a slow-burning brooder, and a piece of entirely cleanly-sung modern rock balladry which finds the bass coming into the spotlight (it features an ominously grumbling bass intro.) But then, the band, of course, rev up the engines once again with \\"Time Will Not Remain,\\" which finds Jesse screaming \\"let's go!\\" over a bed of busy, thrashy picking and pummeling drums.<br /><br />\\"Disarm The Descent\\" defines what it means for a band to return to form. But at the same time, it also shows signs of musical growth and maturity. Hence, it is a mix of both potent old and refreshingly new-sounding material. And it works.
B00000255F|5.0|Regarded as his break out album, this album contains songs that are now considered classics and rock anthems of moving out, moving on and bettering your life.  Jungleland is a work of art with the rich imagery and C's epic sax solo. 10th Avenue Freezeout is the fun &#34;formation myth&#34; of the band that no one truly understands, even Bruce who just says, &#34;It's very important!&#34;  The opening harmonica on &#34;Thunder Road&#34; lets listeners know within a bar or two what it coming.

B005R4HUZM|4.0|Can't miss the presence of a great writer here, packed with deep thought, complex characters, and intricate plot. But the sentences twist and contain church and political references as well as extensive vocaulary, so unless you have a high level of interest in French literature, this big 19th c. novel might lose you along the way. Not only that, the translations I looked at seemed themselves to be guessing at Stendhal's meaning. Rewarding, but you're on your own with this one.

B007FDE4Y8|4.0|First I want to make something clear: A great many of the negative reviews here are from people who bought a product that takes time and research to set up, practice and finesse to use, and yet they were willing to apply none of those things. If you aren't one of those people, this product enables you to take video that is far better quality than you'd get simply handholding your camera. Walk your camera down a hallway and it feels like you're flying-- it's pretty cool.<br /><br />It's helpful to look at tutorial vids for the steadycam merlin when setting this thing up and learning to use it. The principles are all the same, you just make adjustments a little differently.<br /><br />I'm using this thing with a very small camera-- the NEX-5R, and you can tell that it was designed with a slightly larger one in mind. The smallest weight was too heavy, so I had to go find washers that would fit and glue them to the single \\"trim\\" weight until it balanced properly. It's janky, but it works well enough. I'd very much like to see the weights broken down into smaller sizes for finer adjustment.<br /><br />The merlin allows you to adjust the weight on the front, a feature which this opteka doesn't provide. With a small camera like mine, this makes it almost impossible to get the dynamic balance dialed in. I haven't yet hit that perfect balance where you can pan and move it all over without it swaying on you, but it's very close and with careful dampening by hand it works fine.<br /><br />The construction is adequate, but not great. There are some wide tolerances in this thing-- the spar joint has a lot of play in it (though this doesn't affect video much), but the bigger problem is that the spar will rotate ever so slightly around where it attaches to the base. This is problematic, because every time you set it down and pick it up again the roll balance is off and you're fiddling with thumbscrews.<br /><br />Bottom line: it's a solid product, but you can tell it's a knockoffof the merlin. Considering that it's about 1/6 the price, its shortcomings are more than tolerable.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Once hooked, I found Alcott' s portrayal of the four March sisters and their lives captivating, thought-provoking and inspiring!  While the world changes, the interaction between humans has not changed much since Alcott put pen to paper.  A wonderful look into human nature and its foibles, love and forgiveness, as well.<br /><br />Alcott' s use of the English language is prodigious!  Her descriptions are well, beautiful and often stirring.<br /><br />A wonderful tale for teens, especially girls!  But if you haven't read it and are well beyond teen-dom, don't miss it!
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Best family movie we have seen in a long time, based on a true story that will touch your heart.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|First off, what's NOT to like about Denzel. He is a superb actor in his own right. That said, the story line of this movie was exceptional.  It gave you a brief glimpse into the life of an alcoholic, and many of the issues that are associated with this very real DISEASE.  This statement is kind of a \\"Spoiler Alert\\", but what was the most striking scene in the movie (for me)was the one where the character is looking at the nips in the fridge. He's made up his mind not to drink anymore. He's serious! He's not playing this time... everything is riding on this pivotal moment... and then the demon takes over... He's helpless to resist it, and so... he gives himself over to it... and the fall of it was great. Addiction is exactly like that. People often wonder, \\"...why don't they just quit?!\\" But what they don't understand is, it is not as easy as that. There is something that goes on in the chemistry of the brain, that the addict is helpless against, without the necessary resources and unwavering support. That's why they say, \\"One day at a time.\\"  This was a great movie!
B008L5G4I8|5.0|This was the first novel with Inspector Poirot, the little Belgian character.  Story is told by an Englishman, Hastings.  Somewhat like Dr. Watson to Sherlock Holmes.  A complicated plot with many possible murderers.  Agatha Christie is the best mystery writer of all time.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|We have owned this on VHS for years but lost the VHS tape to our VCR. Finally bought the DVD back in the year of 2009 so we can continue watching it. I even buy the DVD to give to friends at my work and family members as Christmas gifts. They all love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I have read this book over and over. I have it on my Kindle and love it. I didn't pay attention to the grammar and spelling because I always get into it.
6305428387|5.0|Bought this DVD to give to my dad as a Father's Day gift because he really likes John Candy. Who Wouldn't. Peter Smith
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|This movie  was quite different from most of Arnie's other movies, even though he still played a really good part.  I did enjoy watching it and would certainly recommend it to others
B004EPZ03O|1.0|Didn't think this was good as the old muppets. If you like the original muppet movies, stick with those. Peter Smith
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I liked this movie, although it was very different from all of the other Die Hard Movies.  I do really like Bruce Willis as an actor and he played the part really well
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This mystery thriller has a great premise which puts it well above most ebook detective stories that come close to the formula of a television show. \\"Time Killer\\" creates a psycho who will reflect the raw animal instinct we have all felt standing in a long line, waiting in traffic or having time wasted by a salesman.<br /><br />Max and Jesse are two partners who don't get along, but they have an insane killer who they must catch. The tension builds and sustain, and the story is well written. This a unique thrill worth a read.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I am in love with this movie. It is pretty much the story of my life to a T. I give it a 10. The way that this love overcomes the obstacles in life is just amazing. I could only hope for this fairy tale ending one day.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was a book that kept my attention.  The more I read, the more I didn't want to put it down.  The ending was a bit of a surprise.  This is the first book I read by Christina McKenna and I plan to read more of her books.<br />I would recommend this to anyone that likes to read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So happy they finally added new levels! Much better than temple run because of the minions. Hard not to smile and laugh
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fairly typical of the genre although Baldacci is a superior writer and storyteller, reminiscent of the early Ludlum; ie, The Gemini Twins.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I have yet to find a better android l rpg then this. It is the most played app on my phone choices in this game is the best, of you are on the fence for this game just do it learning is hard but hey it doesn't hold your hand
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Having beeen hooked on the TV series I had to look into the novels. While the characters are a bit different than portrayed on TV(actually, I wish they were more like thebooks), the stories are great. I have since downloaded all of te novels and read them in the order written. Fascinating!
1608199096|5.0|Such a fun cookbook! Beautifully put together! Only complaint is that the recipes are in metrics, but well worth learning to convert!
B00000IQBN|5.0|Kubrick presides over important advances in cinematography (for example, all natural lighting), plus a pretty good story. Dueling scene exceptional, and likely as close as we can get to 1780's rural England.
0670014893|3.0|The plot is weak.  As is usual in his spy stories, Le Carr&eacute; has created some interesting characters, but his plot on the corporatization of war fails because the evil depicted in the novel just doesn't seem as worrisome as the reality is.
B002ZG983M|3.0|Kinda cool idea and execution ... AND there are a lot of bloody executions ... took a bit of time to get into the film but it generally was worth it
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Cant wait for next season hope they can keep up the quality story and acting. Have been telling everyone to watch it.
B0009S2T0M|1.0|Maybe I just didn't &#34;understand&#34; this flick.  Lord help you if you do.  This flick sucked the BIG ONE - save your $ - no matter how inexpensive it is ...
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Very exciting events continuing with the Barrington Family saga....a must read for all you Jeffrey Archer fans! Cannot wait for the 4 th book!
