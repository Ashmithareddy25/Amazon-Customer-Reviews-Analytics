B00003CXB4|2.0|The movie took the max time to get to me, and when it did it was supposed to have 2 discs, only had one......the seller volunteered to reimburse me 50% which would be great......not sure how long that will take though if it happens (I apologize, I know I am a very impatient person)
B000002J0B|4.0|This release was the follow up to the famous Led Zeppelin Four, which was their most successful release at the time.  The anticipated disk featured the famous Hipgnosis cover, with no actual print on the initial record.  The music inside was still different than other previous Led Zep work.  The opening cut, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" opens with jangling guitars and crisp drum pops.  The first obvious disappointment is the quality of Plant's voice.  He lacks the power that was his trademark on the first releases, tending to moan a little bit.  This is the first indication of Plant's voice being to waiver, proof that one can only scream that loud for so long.  There is much more keyboards by John Paul Jones, especially the great Mellotron on \\"Rain Song\\", with its variations on the G chord. \\"Over The Hills and Far Away\\" approaches the dynamics and power of previous Zep releases, with its acoustic guitar intro that explodes into the powerful verse. Another sandout keyboard line is played by Jones on the haunting \\"No Quarter\\", where John Paul Jones carries the entire song. \\"The Crunge\\" is a funk inspired tune, that pays homage to James Brown, with its reference to \\"the bridge\\". The original second side, opens with \\"Dancing Days\\" with an unusual tuning and guitar riff.  \\"D'yer Maker\\" has a laid back feel, with soft vocals by Plant.  \\"The Ocean\\" is a great Zep pop release, where you can actually hear the squeek of the bass drum pedal, as Bonham slams it.  In all, this disk did not make the impact of previous Zep releases, but it is still a worthy addition.
B0012GMZMW|3.0|Arrival to me is like any band's crossroad Album. It features some new things that work like \\"We Will Meet Again\\" and \\"Signs of Life\\" some old stuff that works like \\"With Your Love\\" and \\"Higher Place\\" and new stuff that doesn't fit the band like \\"Live and Breathe\\" and \\"Nothin' Comes Close\\". Personally this is Journey's Worst album as a whole but I managed to find some songs I liked such as \\"We Will Meet Again\\", \\"With Your Love\\", and \\"Higher Place\\". The Arrival eventually lead to the better sounding Generations which was great and eventually led to Revelation, which to me, is the best Journey Album from this decade. Overall if you're a fan, you might wanna check it out, but if you're just a casual fan, steer clear of this.

B000RIHBIE|2.0|First and foremost, it's within the capacity of every band to try something new.  Sometimes it will work and sometimes it won't.  In the case of 'Underclass Hero', the new formula to devolve and attempt to simply mimic the success of other pop-rock acts just doesn't work whatsoever.    I think what's the most disappointing is that what should have been the next step in the bands legacy - in their evolution, instead, is in reality just another angst-ridden documentary about post-teens upset with America.  That's not to say it's a bad formula as of late;  Green Day's American Idiot revived the band from obscurity and threw them back into the spotlight.      However, what separated Sum 41 from the rest of pop-rock, for me, was their hard rock edge.  On an interview on Conan O'Brein, singer Deryck said that they were going to overthrow ACDC as the next rock stars.  That was immediately after the release of Chuck.     With the departure of guitarist Baksh, the band is merely a shell of its former self.  The metal-riffs and guitar solos are gone and so is the wall that separated Sum 41 from other pop-rock bands.  On it's own, for a new listener, this album may sound fun and uplifting.  The songs have a solid flow to them and everything sounds rather tight.    To anyone who liked the steps Sum 41 made with \\"Does This look Infected?\\" and \\"Chuck\\" you should probably just not purchase this album. Sure, the lyrics are great on some songs - but without the music to support it, it might as well be spoken word.      Here's hope that Sum 41 can rekindle it's flame for the next album and actually release something worth buying.
B001JNNDE2|4.0|I know upfront that this movie has a polarizing effect on the viewer.  There are those who \\"get it\\" and laugh their butts off and then there are those who don't and complain that it is boring, disjointed and generally unappealing.<br /><br />I will say this to those who ask \\"Why do you like it so much?\\"  I can't explain humor.  I will say that months after its release, people such as Mel Brooks referred to it as genius.<br /><br />You need to see it for yourself.

0064407667|5.0|Do you think your life is bad?  If you do, you haven't even begun to feel what it's like to have a miserable and unfortunate events in life like the Baudelaires are having.  In Lemony Snicket's first book, The Bad Beginning, the adventure begins.  This is a fantastic book!   The Baudelaires were once a family with no worries until a day when the Baudelaire children were at the beach and a mysterious fire destroyed their house and killed their parents.  They were assigned to other people that were close to their parents, but one person, the very first one, was a treacherous man.  His name was Count Olaf.  He figure out that the Baudelaire fortune was open and he tried to steal it.  As many times as he has tried to steal the fortune, the Baudelaire children always end up finding a way to stop him from stealing it.  Also, Count Olaf has a troupe that follows him around, and they do whatever he says, because if they don't listen to him, they don't get any part of the Baudelaire fortune.     So read about the Baudelaires and their unfortunate events and encounters with Count Olaf and his troupe as they try to steal the Baudelaire fortune. If you don't you might never know what a miserable and unfortunate event life is like, and you'll be reminded of this story over and over until you are so miserable that you begin a story just like this one.
0061122416|5.0|This book was recommended to me and once I started I could not put it down.  The storyline just flowed and messages from so many aspects of life were great.  Really good book! I've since then recommended it to friends as well!
0375826726|2.0|I have enjoyed the Inheritance series so far, with some reservations.  Mr. Paolini is still very young, and my opinion has been that he is a promising young writer.  Although there were some problems with the first two books, they were fairly enjoyable to read.  A few years ago, I read an interview in which Mr. Paolini compared himself to J.R.R. Tolkien.  This could possibly be a forgivable conceit of youth if Mr. Paolini could show some maturity and growth in his latest book, Brisingr.<br /><br />However, it was not to be.  No one, it seems, loves Mr. Paolini's writing more than Mr. Paolini himself.  The pace of the book is torturously slow.  I kept wading through pages and pages of boring blather among the characters.  The action scenes are too few.  In between are agonizingly long dialogues and descriptions that do almost nothing to advance the story.  An entire chapter is devoted to a (seemingly) all-night conversation between Arya and Eragon.  This occurs in the midst of their flight from Helgrind, followed by soldiers of the Empire.  This is a subject that could, in a more experienced writer's hands, be a page-turning adventure.<br /><br />Mr. Paolini needs to tame his tendency to overwrite.  During the aforementioned conversation between Eragon and Arya, the elf woman's fingers are described as \\"aquiline,\\" which made me laugh out loud.  I am reasonably sure Mr. Paolini did not mean that Arya's fingers were \\"curved like an eagle's beak\\"... but what image he did mean to convey remains somewhat elusive.  There are many of these awkward word choices in his writing style that bring the reader up short.<br /><br />The character I like the most and that comes through the most naturally is Saphira.  She is nearly without self-conceit.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for her creator.  Mr. Paolini has talent, but sadly this is becoming obscured by his seeming fascination with his own writing.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This is a great mixer for a very low price.    I use this mixer to have multiple inputs come out of my computer speakers.

B0000524CY|5.0|I remember when this move came out. Radio stations were offering money to people to go sit in a theater by themselves and watch this movie.    I went with four guys and two of them left before the movie ended. I stayed because I love horror movies. Not much on slasher films but love the suspenseful, scary ones.    My main reasoning behind the success of this movie is simple. Possession has been documented for as long as we can recall. Most horror films are about monsters and things that JUST WON'T DIE..!  The Exorcist is more about a family trying to save a member from the demons that haunt us all.     The possibility that this really could happen or maybe has happened before made it even scarier.    All aspects of the movie were excellent.     Every time that I watch it, it affects me. I'm 52 years old now and it still gets to me.    Turn out the lights, turn the volume up and enjoy, if you dare.
1439102813|5.0|[[ASIN:1439102813 Still Alice]] is a story that will resonate with anyone whose family has been touched by Alzheimer's. Author Lisa Genova's debut novel tells the heart-breaking story of Alice Howland, a Harvard psychology professor coming up to her fiftieth birthday and beginning to experience forgetfulness and disorientation. Alice has a busy active life, traveling to conferences, running for her health, negotiating with her grown children over their career choices, engaging in a full social life with her professor husband. When she loses track of the way home during a routine run in her Cambridge neighborhood she is frightened.<br /><br />More worrying episodes follow; forgetting a flight to a conference, preparing for a lecture and then standing at the podium and not being sure of the subject. Alice seeks medical advice and though there is no definitive clinical test for Alzheimer's, the diagnosis is clear. Alice makes the first set of accommodations to her disease, entering everything in her Blackberry and resigning from her Harvard position.<br /><br />Genova draws a very real picture of a husband unwilling to bend his life to his wife's unexpected needs, and grown children caring for a mother who sometimes doesn't recognize them. Alice's disease progresses rapidly and she uses her productive times to explore support options for sufferers of early onset Alzheimer's.<br /><br />There is an informational  thread running through the book but the strongest element by far is the emotional punch of Alice's lost life. The reader aches over the family conflict arising from her increasing need for care--and the foreshadowing of her difficult future colors the second half of the story.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1439102813 Still Alice]] is a quick, absorbing read that plays on the reader's emotions. It works well as fiction and anyone will hope it stays in that realm for them.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2009

B000T9OP7G|5.0|For awhile, I was very skeptical about the Sarah Connor Chronicles, because I saw the trailers for the show, and pictures of the actors playing the characters, and I just thought \\"I don't see how this is going to work...\\"  Also, I'm not usually one to go for a movie or tv show based on a previous work, that doesn't have the original actors reprising their roles. (Mortal Kombat Annihilation....ugh).     This is the first one I have seen, where I was pulled into the storyline from the first episode. It starts off a bit slow to grasp, but then as you continue watching it, and also keeping in mind that the events of T2 altered the future(changing when Judgment Day occurs), everything just makes more and more sense as the season continues.     Probably the main perk I can grasp here, is the actors/actress's performances. The guy playing John Connor is 10x better and much more believable than who was picked to do so in T3. What was really cool, was that though the original cast wasn't present, the lines and actions done are totally fitting to the characters. The writers didn't take them way out into left field, changing the characters' mannerisms and whatnot, if that makes sense. And I was extremely skeptical about having a female terminator being a protector, especially being so close to John's age, appearance-wise. But Summer pulls it off quite well, and by the end of the season, I had completely forgotten about skepticism.     All in all, especially for less than 20 bucks, it's a very good buy. I'm anxious for the 2nd season to come out on DVD.     Cheers.

B001IZ5B00|5.0|After years of recording mediocre soundtracks, this was Elvis' long-overdue return to making real music. And what a return it was! In a rare smart move, Elvis' management loosened their reigns on him setting him up to work with Chips Moman at Memphis' American Sound Studios to produce this album. The new environment and material seemed to refresh Elvis' creative spirit and he delivered some of the best performances of his career! The majority of the album has a strong R&B flavor, with some country thrown in for good measure and includes the hit \\"In The Ghetto\\". The album reached number 13 on the US Billboard album chart and was certified GOLD by the RIAA, however it was a bigger hit internationally reaching number 1 in the UK.<br /><br />Inexplicably, after the success of these recordings Elvis would never work with Chips Moman again nor be given this amount of creative freedom and quality material.

B000063V8R|5.0|\\"There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders.\\"<br />-- Jean Luc Picard to Admiral Haftel, \\"The Offspring\\"<br /><br />Of all the Next Generation seasons, Three may be the most difficult one to define.  It's easy to point out the fact that it's a far more polished season than its predecessors, featuring immensely superior production values in terms of lighting, color balance, and costumes that lend a more dignified look to the show.  Beyond that though, things get muddled.<br /><br />Season Three undergoes a massive change of identity, most likely due in part to the arrival of new head writer Michael Pillar and a change of executive producers as Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry let go of the reigns due to his declining health.  The new guard behind Next Gen seemed very concerned with making Trek more respectable and less fantastic.  So, while the production values were enhanced to bring about this affect, the direction of the series seemed to follow, largely de-emphasizing the prominence of science fiction in most episodes (with several notable exceptions) and honing in, instead, on political, ethical, and personal drama.<br /><br />This works amazingly well in several groundbreaking episodes including \\"The Survivors,\\" \\"Who Watches the Watchers?\\" \\"The Enemy,\\" \\"The Defector,\\" \\"Booby Trap,\\" \\"The Offspring,\\" and \\"Sins of the Father\\".  The Offspring, in particular, is one of the most powerful dramatic episodes in the entire Star Trek franchise, while \\"Sins of the Father\\" lays the basis for Worf's personal struggles throughout his tenure on Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.<br /><br />There are also several episodes that play up a more character-rich and light-hearted side of Trek, including Luwaxana Troi's abduction by ogling Ferengi in \\"Menege a Troi,\\" Q's amusing tenure as an ordinary human in \\"Deja Q,\\" and Picard's less than laid back vacation in \\"Captain's Holiday.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, this season also contains many relatively dull and dreary episodes that necessarily result from this first attempt to lend more dignity and restraint to a formerly far-out science fiction series.  It's difficult to decide how to fill 45 minutes of episode run time when the phasers aren't firing and there's no hostile force threatening the ship. As a result, while I'd be hesitant to call any episode in this season bad, there are many that I simply consider skippable.  Each has a strong concept at its center, but most simply run too long and fail to provide enough dramatic action.<br /><br />However, just as Next Gen is beginning to feel almost uncomfortably restrained in this season, the writers deliver two of the series' best remembered fantastic science fiction premises: \\"Yesterday's Enterprise,\\" and \\"The Best of Both Worlds P.1\\".  Both are, perhaps, so utterly successful because they blend the fantastic with rich, realistic human drama and polished, respectable production values. Even if the rest of the season were a total wash, these two episodes would warrant the purchase of this volume by themselves, clearly benefiting from all that the new creative team brought to this season.<br /><br />Finally, by the end, Season 3 achieves a new apex of excellence for Star Trek, delivering balanced episodes with compelling human drama at their core while framed by solid, enjoyable science fiction premises operating in the background.  The strongest of these are \\"Hollow Pursuits,\\" which introduces us to the unforgettable Reginald Barkley, and \\"Sarek,\\" in which Mark Lenard reprises his role from the original series.  Then, of course, the series concludes with the already mentioned \\"Best of Both Worlds p.1\\" which, though primarily centered on an action-intensive plot, does incorporate significant emotional drama for the characters and viewers alike.<br /><br />So, while Season Three brings production values, realism, and political and personal drama to the next level, the end result is uneven.  There are many dull moments in this season, yet one can't deny the quantity of exceptional episodes that are spaced out between them.  You're not going to love every episode that Next Generation Season Three has to offer, but the highlights of this season are amongst Trek's finest.exceptional episodes that are spaced out between them.

B001IZ5B0U|3.0|\\"Moody Blue\\" was the last album released during Elvis' life.  Most of the songs were recorded at Graceland. Elvis was in poor health during these sessions and apparently suffering from depression, which affected his motivation. Because of this, Elvis' producer, Felton Jarvis, did not have enough studio recordings for the album and ended up using some live recordings to complete the album. Despite these problems, this collection includes several strong performances.<br /><br />The song \\"Moody Blue\\" was also a Top 40 hit but went all the way to number 1 on the Country charts and number 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart, before Elvis' death. \\"Way Down\\" was released and moving up the charts just before his death. After his death it quickly moved into the top 20 on the Pop chart and was another number 1 Country hit. \\"Pledging My Love\\" is also excellent.  The album became a big international hit after Elvis' death, reaching number 3 on the US Billboard album chart and it spent 10 weeks at number 1 on the US Country Album chart.  It was certified MULTI-PLATINUM by the RIAA.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, this is a good collection and a must for Elvis fans.

0743243153|4.0|This is a fascinating book that helps the reader reflect on their own responsibilities and self-discipline (Part I).  Author Peck's famous opening line \\"Life is difficult\\", becomes the backdrop to explore suffering as an opportunity to grow rather than avoid.  Avoidance in various forms, such as lying, holding untenable views of reality and other unhealthy coping mechanisms are described through real life counseling examples and with brief, though frequent psychiatric explanations for the interested layman. I really enjoyed the author's willingness to explain conditions such as neurosis, schizophrenia, character-disorders and others that occur so commonly. The author frequently points out that the person willing to get counseling advise is often more healthy to begin with than those in denial about their need for help.<br /><br />The ability to mature by giving up certain aspects of one's self to gain new areas of growth is explained in some detail, especially as a feature of mid-life. Peck is also very transparent in telling multiple stories where his client quit counseling as soon as he started getting near the deeper causes of their disorders; it would seem this happens a lot in counseling - challenging profession.  In short, a person must learn to accept and deal with the difficulties in their life through healthy, not unhealthy coping mechanisms.  Peck does not shy away from discussing the reality of spiritual aspects in this journey, though the book is not overtly spiritual and is very open to many spiritual backgrounds and alternative value systems as long as they do not manifest in denial to deal with one's real challenges in life.<br /><br /> In the second part of the book, love is explored in many different ways including: what is and is not genuine love, loving one's self appropriately and especially understanding the unique aspects of others to love them.  Spouses and children in particular are discussed frequently and shown to be opportunities to extend one's self through loving them appropriately.  I found the discussion of really listening to a six-year old quite memorable and helpful. Ultimately loving someone else in a genuine way is a selfless yet selfish act since it allows one to grow in ways not otherwise attainable.  Love is an act of discipline (thus the need for Part I of the book) where we choose to love someone even when we don't feel like it (p88).<br /><br />The final part of the book addresses broader and classical spiritual questions such as the problem of suffering and evil co-existing with a benevolent conception of God.<br /><br />I found this book very insightful and often challenging. I did not agree with some of the minor conclusions made throughout, but they still made me think, even if just hypothetically. This book is not bound at all by Christian orthodoxy or any other orthodox system as far as I can tell, so if you prefer that, you may not enjoy several discussions in the book. But, it is true to the spirit of deep personal growth especially in how to love others in a unique way since each person is an individual.rough loving them appropriately.

B000XPU5NY|4.0|First off, I have all of their albums.  I saw this tour in Chicago when they came through there and it was alot of fun.  Now, I don't care about the key changes to accomodate Phil's voice.  Personally, I wanted to see Phil there rather than Ray Wilson who took over for Phil when Phil left for the Calling All Stations album and tour.  The energy of the band as a whole however I think was a bit lacking.  Musically they were dynamite though!  This 2-disc album is the entire setlist.  They do not include Phil's between song banter though.  For those wanting that, pick up any of the band's shows from this tour.  They are available unedited as official recordings.  The sound for Live Over Europe is quite solid. I had one problem with this set though.  They list the song Turn It On Again as being from Amsterdam.  This is entirely incorrect.  It is actually from Manchester.  While this is a minor mistake, thanks to that, you cant trust any of the other songs as far as where the recordings were taken from and that bothers me somewhat.  You would think they could get something as simple as that correct you know??  Anyway, I recommend the set as a whole for a look at their reunion tour taken from different venues throughout Europe.  You just won't really know for sure the source for each song.  Ughhhh
B000XY9BXK|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, shows in this film just how important what you see and what you hear should be kept to yourself. A photographer, Jimmy Stewert, is confined to a wheelchair because of a broken leg;  he spends his time looking out the window at the world he can no longer walk through.  What he sees is the basis of the terror he witnessed.  The resolution of this tale will keep you glued to your seat;  so be prepred to scream, to cover your eyes, or to run out of the room or all three.  It is a very scary situation that will affect your dreams for some time.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|[ASIN: B000EHSVQ4  Kingdom of Heaven - The Director's Cut (Four-Disc Special Edition) (2005)]    VERY NICE SERVICE!  The product is as new, just perfect!  I am very happy having it ordered from this vendor.    Frankly, the Director's cut of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is worth to watch and keep in your personal library, not only for the Medieval Ages' cinema fans, but also for those that look for real historic epic films of the Crusades.  Historically, the movie is very close to real times, scenarios and customs, and shows the ideals and corruption of knights, people, state, and church of both the Christian and the Saracen kingdoms, and the irony of all called \\"Holy Wars\\".     In addition, this film is not only very interesting, well done, following a surprising plot, but also it is a lot of fun!      The only warning and caution, I would say, is that it should NOT be shown to children and teens.  Practically, there are not sexual content; but the violent scenes, when fighting, require a more mature mind, like many  other violent modern films.
B000KN7BIQ|4.0|It is hard to believe that the Police anywhere are supposed to be our friends; but, when you see them pulling their tricks in an attempt to arrest the bad guys, you really have to think hard - are they protecting us or are they just looking for for fame?  This film presents the viewer with the choice, yea or nay!  The filming, the crew, and the actors show enough of true Police work to facilitate that choice.

B00125WAWS|4.0|A true story which follows the actions of one man to develope a debate team who commanded the power of words which transformed a group of underdog African American college students into an historical powerhouse who even had the temerity to challange the Harvard elite.  To follow the progress of this politically radical debate coach is something to behold.  Regardless of the supposedly low background;  the viewer will stand up and cheer. Once and for all, this film shows that color does not have any influence on success.
B000BCE918|4.0|We bought this three disk pack, after my two year old son saw a glimps of the third third movie on TV.  Since, then every day he had been asking for the dinosaur movie.  We have tried the cartoon versions of dinosaur movies, but no, that was not what he wanted.  So, I went to Amazon and ordered the entire Jurassic Park set.  The first and third movie are excellent, although now I have seen them more than anyone needs to see any movie.  The second movie is lacking, and even my son, would rather watch one of the other.

031606792X|1.0|I absolutely loved the first 3 books!  While I wasn't always thrilled with the direction the stories took, (I am team Edward!!!) I couldn't put the first 3 books down.    Breaking Dawn was hard for me to finish. There are some (brief) parts I enjoyed, but it seemed that Meyer went even more out of her way to complicate things.      Even for fiction, the story lost it's down to earth/relatable feel and became just soooooo hard to follow and silly.    I don't really have an opinion on the story line even, just that it was sooooooo complicated and too many characters involved in everything along the way.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow, if you are serious about wanting to workout but like me you don't have much time during the day because of a busy schedule, then this workout is for you!  It is a hard workout, not boring at all and you will see the difference in no time.    You get 3 levels of workouts in one DVD.  Each level shows a low impact and high impact workout. So once you have level 1 workout down then you can go to the next level.  You get the full workout in just 20 minutes!  And being a mother of 4 with a full time job, 20 minutes is all I can spare.    I have a waist now, my arms look cut (not like Jillian's but I'm working on it) and I'm down to the size I was 20 years ago!  YOU NEED TO GET THIS DVD!
B001KW0C96|4.0|RIGHTEOUS KILL<br /><br />*** ½ Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- September 12th, 208<br /><br />Running Time- 102-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- Russell Gewirtz<br /><br />Director- Jon Avnet<br /><br />Starring- Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Donne Wahlberg, Carla Gugino, Curtis Jackson with John Leguizamo and Brian Dennehy<br /><br />Righteous Kill pairs legendary actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino and even though these two actors have worked together before anytime they star in a movie together there is bound to be a lot of hype and excitement. In recent years both actors have seen a slide in their career and a lot of their movies are panned by fans and critics a like and even their box office numbers have gone down and they aren't the draw they once were. Righteous Kill didn't improve on their box office numbers and fans and critics were split. I suppose having De Niro and Pacino together expectations are bound to be high and the end result here was an ok flick; I don't think this movie was as poor as some made it out to be, but at the end of the day Righteous Kill was simply an ok movie nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />The screenplay by Russell Gewirtz was the biggest flaw with the movie and while it wasn't poorly written the characters lack any depth and the problem is we've seen this movie done many times and Gewirtz offers nothing new with his script. Righteous Kill is a bit complicated to explain without giving anything a way so I'll have to watch what I say. There are a few twists and odds are the audience will figure it out beforehand, which is never a good thing. The other problem is the motive for the killer is really never made clear and the explanation wasn't very good.<br /><br />There was also a sexual assault, but don't worry for those sensitive to scenes like that it was very tame, but the problem I had is that it was kind of pointless and if you lose that scene it would have no impact on the story at all. This movie is driven more by the characters and the fact they lack depth really hurts and the fact the motive is never really given enough detail also takes away. When all is said and done I don't think the movie was poorly written, but the script was heavily flawed.<br /><br />Director Jon Avnet does a fair enough job; the pacing isn't all bad and I can't say I was ever really bored, but Avnet also never really grabbed my attention either. The set ups on the scenes were alright, but lack originality and the excitement needed. Avnet attempts to add some suspense on what's really going on, but they way it was handled is sort of a dead give away, which I suppose can maybe more be blamed on the scripting rather than directing. Overall Avnet does a fair enough job and like I said I was never bored by Righteous Kill, but it never grabbed my attention either.<br /><br />The performances were the strongest part of the movie, but the actors were never given much to work with. De Niro and Pacino work well together and elevate their characters slightly. They work very well with what little depth their characters have. Both Donnie Wahlberg and John Leguizamo are solid, but their characters like De Niro's and Pacino's are given little to work with, but both actors make the best of it. Carla Gugino does well in an underwritten role and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson is surprisingly good in his role. Brian Dennehy has a brief role and is pretty much wasted.<br /><br />Overall Righteous Kill is simply an ok movie; despite the flaws it's nowhere near as bad as some people make it out to be and is an enjoyable, but heavily flawed movie. Don't expect the classic flick that De Niro and Pacino have done in the past, but this is among their better movies over the last couple of years. Again Righteous Kill is an ok flick and worth a watch just don't have your expectations too high.the fact the motive is never really given enough detail also takes away.

B00140PK6O|5.0|For all Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell lovers, this is a masterful human-interest sketch of an early Victorian English village, Cranford. Great acting, wonderful music, beautiful scenery, and an extremely touching and witty storyline. Warning: don't expect to see all of the series in one viewing (unless you have half a day or so)! Just like an English cup of tea, this is meant to be savored, not gulped.

0937381888|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE book for beer brewers of ALL levels!<br /><br />I started as an extract brewer and the first few chapters of this book are great for a brewer who has little or no experience with brewing or fermentation basics. He expands this in later chapters for extract brewers who want to steep grains then gets into all grain brewing.<br /><br />The book is organized very well and it is very easy to find the information you are looking for very quickly. This is my Go-To book for all of my brewing questions. It is a valuable reference book with great explanations on the grains we use, water chemistry, what is happening to beer as we brew it and why it tastes like it tastes.<br /><br />If I had to have only 1 brewing book, this would be the book I would recommend to everyone at any level of brewing! This book has helped me to fine-tune my brewing and helped me make great beer.
0141023570|5.0|The title comes from the fact that one of the two main characters, Lennie, is a little retarded, but is still a kind man who only wishes for goodness.  The other character, George, has more sense and knows his goals.  He has dreams of buying a piece of land and settling down.  He makes a continuous effort to keep Lennie's erratic behavior in check and keep him out of trouble.  However, in one incident, he held a mouse in his hand so tightly that he killed it, only desiring to caress it, but not knowing his own strength.  He also has a rather awkward moment with a young farm girl in one of their migrant worker jobs, who terrifies him by screaming in Lennie's presence, driving the man to shake her until her life is gone.<br /><br />George always tries to rescue Lennie when he finds trouble, although he eventually realizes that he cannot watch him forever.  Realizing that the girl's death is just too much to handle, he relinquishes his dreams of a ranch and a life for the two of them in order to find a more direct solution to Lennie's problems.<br /><br />This is a story of lessons in life that force you to reconsider what you invest in your friends.  Of Mice and Men is a story of friendship, of devotion, disappointment and realization.  John Steinbeck tries to show how flimsy our friendships can become even if they started off with the best of intentions and how loyal we must be to keep them intact.  Yet, he filters out the hardships we endure just to survive and maintain a certain distance from those whose behavior effects us in detrimental ways.  Again, Steinbeck is a genius, perfecting his storytelling by delving into the minds of these two men to see at what cost they remain devoted and loyal.  I think Steinbeck has captured the spirit of hopes, dreams and wishes in a truly American episode of our great West.
B00000JLEP|5.0|To be honest, I probably needn't bother with writing this: anyone looking at recordings of Scriabin's music knows that he was a genius (a bit bizarre personally, but a genius). So just in case you need a bit of prompting here: this is amazing, deep music. Not a lot of hummable tunes, but if you are looking here, you probably aren't that interested in hummable tunes anyway. Whether you are a fan of Scriabin's or not, buy this and listen to it multiple times. It is beautiful, deep, dark, a bit twisted, and just plain amazing.
074322454X|5.0|This book is amazing. He goes into so much detail to recout the history, the training and the people you feel like you know them. He even talks about their lives after the war.

The correct answers given in the contest was totally not acceptable. The guy goes to the police station between the shows and gets massive beating and the slums suddenly speak very good english etc etc. The music is also  very average.  If this movie gets oscar, I ask the judges to go and watch only movies made in Mumbai. Translate all the Indian movies and start giving them Oscars. Slumdog is nothing compared to movies made in Mumbai. Totally dissapointed to see oscars selection.

The Extras on here are awesome as well including an Alternative Ending that Walt Disney himself proposed !    Definitely a buy if you have children... OR... if you plan on having children within the next 10 years I would buy it anyway because it is going back in the Disney Vault in a few weeks and won't return for years after!!

B0012E6R3W|2.0|Strains of Metallica's brand of thrash metal brute can be heard throughout the album, particularly on tracks like \\"Henchman Ride and the anthemic \\"More Than Meets the Eye\\", which would have been awesome on the Transformers movie soundtrack.     Lyrical content is probably the major downfall of this album. There are moments when song lyrics read like something out of a Spinal Tap B-side: \\"I will fight relentlessly/ I stand tall defiantly/ I fulfill my destiny\\", and \\"Smell the blood/ Smell the death/ Smell the stench of demons' breath.\\" Because of this, songs like, \\"Dangers of the Faithless\\" and \\"Leave Me Forever\\" are pretty laughable.    Elsewhere, the lyrics deal with topics not typically found in metal, such as the terrorist attacks of 9/11 (\\"The Persecuted Will Not Forget\\") and the death of a loved one (\\"Afterlife\\"). Unfortunately, this does not keep the album from sounding quite linear. Although, the guitar work is outstanding and the drums are driving and brutal, many of the riffs and vocal lines seem like they were cherry-picked from metal albums of yesteryear.

B0010V4TZU|3.0|Some of you may be very well aware of Brooklyn, New York indie-rockers, Vampire Weekend, who released their self-titled debut in 2008. The band's supercharged single \\"A-Punk\\" got ton of play on MTV and YouTube earlier last year. It is a song that perhaps best exemplifies the group's breezy African-pop infused indie-rock. The two-minute ditty is filled with a march of jangly guitars, a whimsical flute melody, yelping vocals, and a ridiculously catchy bassline.    In similar way that Weezer made geekiness cool in 1995, Vampire Weekend revels in their preppiness. The four members of the band met while attending Columbia University. This academic background is extremely apparent the lyrics. In fact, you probably need a dictionary to understand half of what vocalist Ezra Koenig is singing about: \\"You spilled kefir on you keffiyeh\\" or \\"Charm your way across the Khyber Pass\\" among other things. Although, it should be mentioned that Vampire Weekend has managed to create quite possibly the coolest song ever written about commas (aptly-titled \\"Oxford Comma\\").    While the hyper-literate wordplay may have English buffs foaming at the mouth, at moments it seems the band is going out of its way to prove their wits. Although, college students will probably find the lyrical images of academia as quite a nice touch (\\"Then I see you, you're walking cross the campus/Cruel professor/Studying romances/How am I supposed to pretend/I never want to see you again\\").    And while some music bloggers may see Vampire Weekend's release as somewhat akin to the Second Coming of Christ, this is most certainly not true. The album is undeniably enjoyable, but it is not the best 2008 has to offer. As far as one of the best singles of the year \\"A-Punk\\" I heard in 2008. It is arguably one of the best tracks I've heard all year. However, I don't think this band, or this album is anything more than what it is -meaning it sounds like exactly what it is-- a couple of New England prepsters who listened toa few Afro-pop albums and started a band who managed to put out a decent debut.    Grade: C
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Essentially, this film highlights the greed that controls healthcare in the United States and the system's failings, while pointing out that other countries are providing healthcare for their people that is patient-oriented rather than profit-oriented.  The film is lacking in statistics, but does its job in bringing a very important issue to the attention of thousands (if not millions) of viewers.<br /><br />Many Americans tend to be short-sighted in opposing \\"socialized\\" medicine as a knee-jerk reaction to something they see as evil on the idea that it takes away their rights or availability to the best doctors.  Most of us only have access to the best medical care if we have the right health insurance coverage and/or happen to be located near a major city with a large selection of hospitals.  I find it hard to believe that if the United States were to enact some form of socialized medicine that you still wouldn't be able to find specialists with private practices, if you were unhappy with the local health facility.  The major difference would be that, with socialized medicine in the U.S., the average American who has worked all his/her life would probably not have to face lack of medical treatment, homelessness and/or bankruptcy when faced with a debilitating illness that leaves them unable to work and without health insurance.<br /><br />I will mention one of the film's highlights, as I appreciate the fact that Michael Moore always takes things to an extreme to get his point across.  Taking people in need of medical care to Cuba to demand healthcare for them that is equal to that which terrorists being held at Guantanamo Bay are receiving was absolutely inspired.  (I didn't think it could get any better than when Michael tried to return bullets to KMart that were inside the surviving Columbine victims or when he asked members of Congress to enlist their own children in the military in his previous films.)<br /><br />Thank you, Michael, for making this film!  I hope it motivates everyone in the U.S. who views it to demand the right to patient-oriented, accessible and affordable healthcare for all.ne in the U.S. who views it to demand the right to patient-oriented, accessible and affordable healthcare for all.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|...I dont know what it is.  It would be easy to drop the ball on this subject and make a bad series.  It is, after all, something that most people (fortunately) have little knowledge about, and it could attempt to be written for the masses, and \\"dumbed-down\\".  But its not.<br /><br />Dexter is chilling, but in an informative, eye-opening way that a good documentary does.  Michael C. Hall, who I thought was pretty wooden in Six Feet Under, plays the conflicted sociopath brilliantly.  A strong supporting cast strengthens and already strong show.<br /><br />I realize that being sympathetic to a seriel killer seems counter-intuitive, but it is the intelligence of the writers that draws you in to Dexter's world.  You ALMOST feel bad for the guy for the hand he's been dealt, and SOMEWHAT admirable for the way he's made lemonade out of his life's lemons.<br /><br />This show couldn't exist on network TV, and like many other \\"rawer\\" shows, needs a lot of room to run.  I'm interested to see how far they can take this series from a consistency standpoint, but if S2 and S3 are a fraction of S1's quality, I'll be there for the ride.

B001P9KR94|1.0|Slum Dog Millionaire is the most over-rated film of the decade. If it hadn't been touted as the best film of the year or a feel-good movie, I would have said it was an okay film. But all this hype and all these awards? Deeply disturbing and violent, little to feel good about other than the superficial fairy-tale ending. The \\"feel good\\" label is a total misrepresentation. It's like saying The Reader (a much superior film) is about the importance of literacy. NOT.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|The movie attempts to go where epic movies once succeded ... but this one generally fails. This despite having a decent cast, astonishing scenery and most importantly telling the tale of the generally overlooked unjustices done by the english immigrants to the native people of Australia.<br /><br />It seems the director believes it is necessary to make use of the same (in todays eyes) corny punchlines and cliches of the epic movies of the 50s and 60s to develop an epic today. Even the music and sound sends you back in time, with dramatic 'manly' music accompagnying Hugh Jackman as he enters the scene on his horse... outrageous unless it is meant as a parody which somehow does not seem to be the case.<br /><br />BUT and a big but is that the vastness and beauty of the Australian outback is well represented and it is about time Australia faces its grim recent past in terms of it appauling treatment of the native Australians... but this being a movie review that does not make up for the cornyness of this movie.

B0017HEYEI|5.0|Movie was in a foreign language.  Seller was very friendly &  cooperative in email response and reimbused me without any problems.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  I originally saw it online, and loved it so much I decided to buy a copy.  It's so much easier to pop the DVD in and watch the whole thing rather than have to hunt around for each section online.  The movie itself is hilarious.  Nathan Fillion is great as the cheesy and incredibly self-absorbed Captain Hammer.  Neil Patrick Harris is outstanding as the title character, Dr. Horrible, and his alter-ego Billy.  His is a brilliant performance, ranging from Billy's awkwardness when dealing with the girl of his dreams, Penny (Felicia Day), who he sees at the laundromat, to his ambitious and almost-ruthless Dr. Horrible.  The music is great and still has me singing along a year after I first heard it.  The lyrics are classic Joss Weden and have a wonderful mix of humour, cleverness and serious storytelling.  Definately an A+ production.
B001UW58YK|2.0|Michael,       I am a huge fan and have bought every CD and DVD you've released. You're one of the few good artists left. Sinatra recorded what? Over a hundred LP's and CD's...and yea I bought most of them plus I've bought every recording Tony Bennett ever made. What's the main difference with your CD's and Sinatra's hundred, Bennett's hundred, and Streisand's first fifty albums...even Johnny Mathis with his wide array of albums??? These four giants introduced us to new songs or old songs with new arrangements and I was thrilled and always got my money's worth when I purchased all of these...but Michael, you need a new A.&R. man to select a dozen new tunes when you decide to cut a new album or CD. It seems that every Buble CD I purchase seems to be songs you've recorded over and over. ASCAP and BMI have literally hundreds of thousands of pop, jazz, and ballads which would fare well with your great voice! You appeal to an older set who miss the great recording artists in past decades. Look at the amazing Ella, she cut double discs of the music of Gershwin, Berlin, Rodgers, Ellington, Kern, on and on and on and my (your) generation couldn't wait for her next release. PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! Pick twelve to twenty older standards and give us our money which becomes YOUR money when we're pleased. Is there ONE new cut on the \\"Caught in the Act\\" new release? Looking at the contents, I think I already own two, three, or possibly four previous cuts by you on older CD's.  Give Barbra or Tony a call and ask them for ideas of songs to record in case YOU'VE run out of ideas. Sure, I love Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse's \\"Feeling Good\\" from \\"Roar of the Greasepaint\\".but they wrote dozens of songs equally as good which would show off your talent extremely well. See if you can find a Newley/Bricusse original cast album of \\"It's a Good Old, Bad Old World\\"...and discover its hit song, \\"The Best Things in Life Were All Mine\\". It was written for a singer such as yourself. Am I ready...in order to be a true Buble fan...to fork out another twenty-five bucks for the Blu-Ray \\"Caught in the Act\\" when I bought it last year, the year before...and the one before that???
0738711500|5.0|I have gotten several sets of various cards and I really enjoy   this set ~ the instruction book is very well written also.  enjoy
B001GCUO1G|1.0|i have read that one of the motives why it's unfair this movie is circling the net unfinished is because people are starting to crticize it before its conclusion which in theory i would agree but after seeing this \\"gem\\" i think most of the hollywood movies should be seen with apparent wire work, bad transitions, weak post production. that way it is in your face the way this and other movies have no interest in doing something good. its completely marketing research and \\"professionals\\" that are professionals because they deliver and are there on time but by no means you could call them creative. this really really sucks. the industry is going to a scary place right now. one of the nominees this year for best cinematography was benjamin button which was done almost entirely in green screen. \\"cinematography\\"? best actor??? that is trully wrong. this industry has failed and has been failing for years. this is just another example.
0712618198|5.0|A beautiful book the type you can read over and over and get something out of it each time
0792843584|1.0|You can't see it, you can't hear it (and in one release, there were actually subtitles for the English-speaking actors)--but there are those who consider this mess cinematic genius. But then the French believe Jerry Lewis is a comedic genius. This unfortunate mess has within it a darn good film about the Johnson County War and it has a really terrific cast (including Willem Dafoe in his movie debut). But as a whole, it is a waste of time, talent, and celluloid. I have seen the uncut and cut versions, so editing won't help it. Not only did this film sink troubled United Artist but also the entire Western genre. The treatment of animals on the set  prompted the Screen Actors Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers to contractually authorize the American Humane Association to monitor the use of all animals in all filmed media. It's been more than 10 years since Michael Cimino's name has been attached to an American film. I understand that he is directing or will direct an adaptation of Andre Malraux's 1933 novel Man's Fate. I don't know what to say. Maybe if you haven't seen it, you should. Although not the worst movie ever made, it's an ambitious film with nothing to say. Much of the movie is beautiful to look at but so much of it is shot at twilight that even the scenery is lost on you. Because Cimino doesn't seem to know or understand the people he put on the screen, he is incapable of telling their story. The same contempt that Cimino had for the people in Deer Hunter, is evident here.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|I bought this album on Vinyl for 25 cents at a small used clothing store not thinking much about it except that I had heard of Deep Purple and that it was so very cheap. I figured i could throw it out if it sucked and it wouldn't be a waste of time. When I put it on my first impression was, \\"man these guys can play.\\" The Musicscianship found on this album alone makes it 1 of the greatest metal albums i have heard to this day. It might be my favorite \\"early metal\\" album if I was to sit down and contemplate a list. The opening title track is a furious, speedy (for '74 it must have been light speed)charging bull of a track that just plane moves. My second favorite track is the oddly funky, yet sublime \\"sail away\\" which might have been the opening song for Saturday Night Fever had the film been about a 70's head banger rather than a Disco dork. Other than that this is all good, mind boggling solos from Blackmore, cool, enchanting touches from Lord and jack rabbit on PCP drum work from Paice. Since buying that album at age 15 I have heard every DP album and as great as \\"Machine Head\\" is, to me this is the most satisfying, muscular and impressive. I know many will take exception to that opinion but hey, what can i say? When I want to throw on some Purple, this is the album I reach for first.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|This is a terrific show. Great music and such sharp/clear video quality. Well worth the price.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|Although this movie has garnered more than its share of rave reviews I confess myself somewhat puzzled.  It's a pleasant romp through familiar Woody Allen territory, though thankfully minus Allen himself as the primary protagonist and thankfully not set in Manhattan.  There are essentially three human characters in the movie. The first is The Romantic Artist, here incarnated in cliched form as Juan Antonio and his ex-wife Maria Elena. Then comes American Woman, here incarnated not only as the two young American tourists but also as their elder female hostess.  Finally comes American Man, uniformly drab and materialistic and rather dim, incarnated as the the male host and the guy from New York whom Vicky will end up marrying and additionally, in case the point wasn't made obviously enough, the male half of a couple that makes a brief over-dinner appearance full of chatter about expensive houses and entertainment systems. The fourth character - if we want to stretch the point just a little - is Barcelona, or at least a tourist's notion of the city-as-backdrop.<br /><br />Allen's point seems to be that American women are incapable of really engaging with life.  Vicky holds life at bay through a series of elaborate quasi-intellectual charades in which she always misses the key point. Christina, who seems more willing to throw herself into the stream of life and let it carry her, in fact always extricates herself at the moment when she'd have to commit to really living.  As the movie puts it, \\"she didn't know what she wanted, but she knew what she didn't want.\\" And finally the hostess is living one of those lives of quiet desperation, too afraid to leave a dead marriage and too afraid to begin an affair.  Likewise American Man is the walking dead.  Only the Artist - in this case the Spanish binary star of Maria Elena and Juan Antonio - is willing to risk all (health, sanity, relationships) to swim with the currents of life.<br /><br />This is, however, a fairly humdrum theme around which to try to wrap a movie.  Barcelona, which is one of the world's great cities, makes a vague and fleeting appearance from time to time but the air pollution precludes sweeping panoramas and the camera work is so uninspired that the street shots could have been done almost anywhere.  The dialog is authentically banal and without great camera work there's little to draw us into the movie and carry us along.  The overall issue is that there simply isn't much of interest in the tale of two American female tourists who are so wrapped up in their own neuroses that they utterly fail to be changed by their summer experiences.  We already know that Americans are, in general, repressed and that they cling to sterile and restrictive \\"appropriate\\" norms in order to navigate the strange world that otherwise might overwhelm them.  We already know that people who work in Manhattan are, for the most part, acquisitive empty shells. And frankly few of us will buy Allen's thesis that The Great Artist holds the keys to anything other than a barn full of pretentious canvases.<br /><br />On the bright side Penelope Cruz does yeoman work as the histrionic Maria Elena and the quite dramatic consumption of cigarettes in the movie must have boosted the share price of at least one tobacco company.<br /><br />This is an inoffensive but essentially empty movie in which little happens and less is achieved. If this is all Allen has to say after so long, perhaps it's time to head for the Old Moviemakers' Rest Home.h to try to wrap a movie.

1416914307|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! It's unfortunate some aren't going to read it because of Clary and Jace's incestuous relationship in the first two books, let me tell you if that's your reason for not reading then PLEASE set it aside and just read this book! You will be amazed! I am definitely looking forward to Clare's next series in Fall 2010!
B001EOQWF8|2.0|I just don't get this movie. I love animations, especially Pixar movies, but this one was uh, really lame IMO. If you can stand the fact that Wall-e says \\"WAAAALLLLEEEE\\" about a million times, and the fact that Wall-e is not exactly the most cuddly character, because he is well, a metal box with a Johnny-5 head, then this movie might be for you. Oh and he acts more like a 5 year old kid, so if you like 5 year old love then I would recommend this movie. The black comedy sequences that are so common in animations these days were sub-par in this one. The one good thing about the movie though was that I admire the concept of people leaving the earth so that it can be cleaned up and we can return.. or so we thought! That was kind of clever and brings some realism to the story. Its always enjoyable to see what the future of humanity is going to be like, but this one was a little too cheesy.     If you haven't seen this yet I'd recommend seeing it just to say you saw it, but if you're a grown man like myself, don't buy it, just rent it. Or maybe if you get a really great price on the Blu-ray ;)    By the way, the rabbit cartoon in the beginning is HILLARIOUS (don't know if this is on the DVD/B-R). Make sure to watch it if its in the extras.
B00005JLCI|1.0|Kenneth Branagh's reputation as the golden boy of Shakespearean actors crashed with this over-done Hamlet.  There's a good reason why no sane producer actually uses all of the text un-cut.  It's a six hour slog--and I say this as a literature professor, not as a surly student.  In terms of acting, Branagh again misses the mark, looking very old to be Denmark's young prince.  Added to the grinding length and mis-cast lead, the special effects here (green screen work, mostly) would embarrass your local weather man.    For an understated but elegant alternative, check out Kevin Kline's Hamlet.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is the true story of one Englishman's crusade -- and ultimate victory-- against slavery in England.  From what I have read on the subject, the film stays close to fact. Although this is a serious film, it is not overly heavy, and is not preachy. The seriousness of the matter is balanced with humor and wit about the human condition. There's matchmaking, schemes to outfox politicians, etc.   One of my favorite scenes is when one self-important politician finally gives in and grudgingly comes to an abolitionist meeting.  The first thing out of his mouth is --- Well, do any of you, \\"saints\\", drink?  Promply a bottle of whisky is produced!    Also in the film, our hero - Ioan Gruffudd-  can actually sing as well as act  Some may recognize him from his lead role in the PBS series \\"Horatio Hornblower\\".    The only slight negative to the film IMHO is that it incorporates flash-backs, which sometimes threw me off regarding where exactly we were in the scheme of things.  Other than that, it's a terrific film.  I highly recommend it.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is by far, the best comedy (cast and entertaining content) on TV.  It takes a few episodes to get into the characters, but buying the Season One DVD quickly introduces one to its brilliance.  A true bonus is the explanation, by the writers and producers, of the characters' derivations and roles.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|There aren't many movies that live up to the hype seen on previews and ads. Fewer still in the comedy genre that might have a shot at an Oscar. But TROPIC THUNDER does both thanks to a sturdy screenplay, perfect acting, and some of the funniest dialogue you'll hear this year.<br /><br />Standing out amongst other ridiculous comedies that often go for the cheap-shot, Tropic Thunder hits higher comedic notes thanks to a plethora of items. First is the screenplay. From the VERY BEGINNING of the film, you immerse yourself in these characters' lives. My advice to movie-watchers is to show up early and watch the previews, as you're in for a not-so-subtle surprise. The \\"faux-previews\\" were an excellent way to introduce the characters and get an immediate feel for who they were. And who are they? Ben Stiller ([[ASIN:B000NOKJBS Night at the Museum]]) stars as Tugg Speedman, an actor on the downward slide of success. Having been a big action star (think Sly Stallone), Tugg is having difficulties procuring decent roles. Although Stiller does a fine job as the actor-turned ...well ...actor, he doesn't hit the mark in terms of losing himself in the part like others did (see below)...<br /><br />Jack Black ([[ASIN:B000HDZK1Y Nacho Libre]]) is Jeff Portnoy, a two-bit actor who's comedies are all about gaseous releases (\\"Everybody laughs at me just because I fart!\\"). He's also an addict and when he tries to clean up in the jungles of Vietnam, Black turns in some of the funniest bit lines of the film (many of which I can't state here and earned this film its firm R rating). In terms of acting history, Portnoy's follows similar terrain as that of Eddie Murphy in his fat suit films.<br /><br />Brandon T. Jackson stars as Alpha Chino (need I say more? Yes? Okay). A rough, tough, black man with a gentler -- shall we say -- feministic side, Jackson battles his sexuality as well as his ethnicity.<br /><br />Jay Baruchel ([[ASIN:B001CW7ZUS Knocked Up]]) comes on as Kevin Sandusky, the only \\"normal\\" guy in this cadre of demented and damaged actors. He envies their acting histories and has a bit of hero worship going on with one of them. He also turns out to be the glue that helps hold the gang together. Think Tom Hanks in [[ASIN:B000NA7WS0 Saving Private Ryan]] and you'll be close.<br /><br />And saving the absolute best for last, we have bad-boy Robert Downey Jr. ([[ASIN:B001GAPC1K Iron Man]]) as Kirk Lazurus, a confused white man gone black, and lost amidst his multiple character personalities. Watching him peel back his personas toward the end of the film was sheer genius. Lazurus so immerses himself in-character that he doesn't come out \\"until the special features on the DVD.\\" He's also tough to deal with. And he's an Aussie. And he's a great actor. Sound like anyone you know? Russell Crowe should rapidly come to mind.<br /><br />The screenplay must get notice here, too. And mentioning that Justin Theroux had his hand in it. This is the same Theroux who starred in the sensational series [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under]]. He seems to have understood how to come up with comedy that isn't [[ASIN:B001IKKMD6 Dumb and Dumber]], and hits the mark head-on.<br /><br />The dialogue is simply astounding, especially when coupled with these well-knowns in the comedic field. But Downey Jr. is the real star here, delivering his lines with flawless precision and in a voice that irritates the heck out of Alpha Chino, a real black guy who finds Lazurus' constant in-characterness to be grating and insulting.<br /><br />This is truly a phenomenal piece of cinema, with action and comedy meshed so well together that there's not a single moment for the mind to rest.<br /><br />Oscar worthy?

B000002GQE|5.0|This one is for all us \\"older folk\\", in that this has a rock-symphony sound that we grew up to. Of course, not everyone is into symphonic music, but mix it with the Moody Blues, and wow!!  A must have for the collection!
B0000CDJPQ|3.0|I initially ordered this from JDRoth because I needed an adapter for my Mac. I was able to find it locally at a much cheaper price than what they offered. It was a protracted process getting them to credit my return in terms of waiving the re-stocking fee(when I never opened the package) I think that they should say up front on the web page when they advertise items what their policies are instead of the customer having to go to their web site to find this out. I also had to pay to send this item back to them, so I am not happy that they would not reimburse the shipping. I will not be ordering from them again.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Because it won eight Oscars, I came to this film with high expectations and was disappointed.  A simple fantasy story of rags to riches, that appeals to the emotions but not the head.  Understandably popular in these tough economic times when many dream of \\"winning the lottery\\" and in these times of reality tv craze.<br /><br />But the story, if considered rationally, is not believable at all.  The accents are sometimes difficult to understand.  The English subtitles are difficult to see on the small screen.  Nonetheless I give it 4 stars, because, had it not been nominated for any Oscars, it would have been just a simple entertaining 2 hours, and it deserves that much credit.  Plus Dev Patel does a splendid acting job.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The BBC version is so much better than the discovery version. First, its  1080p the discovery is 1080i, there is a difference if you own a blu-ray. Second, David Attenborough does a much better job plus you see the longer version since discovery cut alot out for commercials.

B001IAOEXU|4.0|Since this is not a game, but an addon for the PS3 controller, I have to rate it as such. It is a good addon for the controllers and makes gaming with FPS a lot better.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|Still the best movie collection of all time.<br /><br />Awesome work on the restoration, I like the \\"warmer tone\\" set in the movie, it gives it a more stylish look then previously available on the old DVD box set.  The new DVD of extra is well appreciated (even if they mixed the DVD printing, and switched the DVD 4 and 5).  But even with this, it's still 5/5.<br /><br />Now, I'm waiting for \\"THE GODFATHER TRILOGY: 1901-1980\\" on DVD, (not to be confused with The Godfather: The Complete Epic).  You can find the information about these two versions here:<br />[...]
B00003CXTG|5.0|The DVD arrived very quickly and was exactly as described!  It was purchased as a gift and the recepient was really appreciative as he is quite the WWII buff.  I will definitely order from this seller in the future!

I thoroughly enjoyed the album and recommend to anyone who likes classic rock n roll or more folk sounding music.
B001DCQIAU|4.0|What other reviewers have said in praise of this set is all true -- it's an incredible bargain for such a trove of music.  But geez, did DG have to be so chintzy in designing the set?      Comes in a 2\\" high box, which is fine.  Inside is a 32-page booklet that lists each track of each CD, nothing else, not a word about von Karajan -- well, OK, I guess, but I bet that people buying this bargain box may well not know much about him, so couldn't they have written a page?  A paragraph?       Biggest problem:  the CDs themselves aren't numbered sequentially 1-thru-38 throughout the box.  Instead, they are color-coded.  So there are 6 Beethoven discs, which are red and have 1 thru 6 on them, then they are followed by 3 green Brahms discs, which are numbered 1 thru 3, then they are followed by 9 aqua Bruckner discs, which are numbered 1 thru 9....    You get that?  Composers are gathered alphabetically, and discs are numbered within a composer's set, but there's no way, looking at the booklet, to see that the Haydn symphonies 82, 83 and 87 show up on the 19th disc.  Instead, you have to hunt through the colors and composers and -- this was clearly a case where a designer was allowed to design away, and no one at DG said \\"Wait a minute, is this the easiest way to help people sort through these 38 CDs?\\"      I won't even get into the wackiness of assigning different colors to different composers.  Can't you just see the four-hour closed-door meetings at DG, where they fought over why Mozart gets purple while Schumann gets orange?      All of this is beside the point of the music itself, naturally.  The music is fine, just fine.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Condition was exactly as advertised...new in the box.  Arrived on the day it was promised.
0143038583|4.0|This is such an important topic nowadays when people are eating highly processed foods and have no clue where the ingredients come from. You would think Michael Pollan is another \\"radical\\" researcher preaching about things we need to stop eating right now, but he actually writes from a quite naïve (yet intelligent) perspective. He is someone we can almost all identify with: just a curious guy in search for answers on where our food really comes from. It is clear from the very beginning that he did a great deal of research. That combined with his charisma and honesty while describing his adventures is what makes this book so special. I liked the historical and scientific background presented in the first few chapters, but truly enjoyed the more subjective parts describing Pollan's experiences at the organic farm and later on hunting and cooking in California. This book is informative and at the same time quite entertaining!
0525421033|5.0|I can't quite remember where or how I heard of this book, but it sounded interesting and different. When I received this book I was surprised at how short it was, I wondered how can you tell a gripping even interesting story in under 200 pages? *Boy, was I surprised*  I am a 35 year old mother of two who is an avid reader, I'm also a  sucker for a love story and just adore YA Books.  I picked up this book Saturday night at 9:30pm and literally read the entire book in one sitting. This book surprised me beyond words. I read the last 3-5 pages through my tears, and when I was done and closed the book the first thought that came to my mind was \\"this was the most beautiful well written story I've ever read!!!\\".  The story flowed so well, at times I cried and laughed and it really made me think.  I read about 20 books a year and this will be a book that I tell ever single person I know to read.  I wish I could write a review for this book that would truly do it justice!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|This was a very funny movie.  A very different story line, expertly done by Jos and the Cast.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|Fantastic movie with a wonderful cast and authentic southern dialect with an original soundtrack. It really keeps you guessing as to who murdered whom and what will happen next. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a mystery.   If you don't buy it, at least rent it.

0670451495|5.0|Having gone to school in Boston I must say this book is right on the spot. The Boston Gardens are a place you would wish to spend a lot of time basking in the sun reading or just hanging out. This picture book is a cantankerous look at the Ducks that have been a part of the gardens lure. This book is also a joy on a long plain ride or just eye candy for a day on the green grass of your city park. This book is fun for adults and the child alike. The truly tonsorial photographs are worth the price of the book alone. A joy any way it is looked at it.. Bravo!
B001NFNFIK|5.0|If you are a fan of Dave Robicheaux, you will like this film. Tommy Lee Jones is an excellant choice to play the lead.  The film follows James Lee Burke's book closely but there are a few digressions.  If you are not already a fan of Dave Robicheaux, this could get you started on the path. Buddy Guy's appearances and music, unfortunately, are too short and too far in between, the only disappointing thing about the movie.

B001N26GFM|3.0|Nicely staged, acted and photographed.  But the story is so far-fetched that it interferes with the suspension of disbelief.
0312370849|5.0|This book was so fascinating, so real, heartwarming, but so sad.  I couldn't put the book down and plan to review it in my Book Club at church.  This was indeed a part of WWII history that should never have happened, leaving the French government very ashamed that they even had a part in it to this very day.  We'll never know the minds of the Germans that tortured and killed wonderful Jewish people and children for no reason but for Hitler's gain.  You will never forget this fictional story.

0312370849|5.0|I picked this book up at Target.  It was in their \\"Bookmarked\\" rack and as soon as I read the back blurb I knew it was the kind of book I would enjoy.  But enjoy is too tepid a word for the way the book made me feel.  SARAH'S KEY is one of those rare books that touches you so deeply, you feel as if you are right there, sharing Sarah's pain, going through every excruciating experience with her.  This was a very dark period in the world's history and it's shameful that France was part of that darkness.  I can see why they wouldn't want to talk about this particular episode in their past.  I'm grateful to de Rosnay for writing about it and impressed by her ability to make the story so emotionally compelling.  I am so glad I bought this book and want to encourage others to buy it, too.  You won't regret it.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this cheaper than I ever thought I could have here!  My husband loves this set and was so greatful for them!  I never saw them before and watched them with him and I was shocked how good they were. We watch alot of the discovery channel and informative programs so this was perfect for us.  It was entertaining and informative.  It had beautiful shots of places that are some of the most interesting places on earth.  I was amazed that I got this entire set for as cheap as it was offered on Amazon and I would recomend this to anyone that enjoys informational programing.

B000JLTR8G|5.0|Sydney Pollack's 'The Yakuza' is simply one of the best \\"gangster\\" films ever produced, made more complex, resonant, and distinctive by it's examination of and immersion in the unique and complex culture of Japan, both ancient and modern, and the rigid moral code of its organized criminal clans.    The film also benefits hugely by being made on location in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, and by the fine performances of the marvelous Japanese actors in the cast, especially Keiko Kishi, a much-respected actress, and the iconic Ken Takakura, sometimes called the \\"Clint Eastwood of Japan\\". And, along with the film's often eloquent dialogue, it is his quiet, stoically resonant performance, along with Mitchum's wonderfully world-weary yet warm contribution, which gives the film its mournfully haunting emotional core.    And, at its heart, that core deals with the theme of \\"giri\\". Japanese for obligation, it is also defined as \\"burden\\", or, more specifically, \\"the burden hardest to bear\\". It is this theme which forms the powerful background to a moving and uncommonly layered study of obligation, honor, and friendship, and what those concepts mean when taken to their ultimate extreme.    Not particularly gory or explicit by today's standards -- or even when compared to 'The Godfather' films -- the violence makes a strong impact, nonetheless, both because of how it's choreographed and because of the particular use of the kitana, better known as the samurai sword.       Stylistically, the film has a unique rhythm -- a kind of poetic, almost mystical serenity punctuated by sudden bursts of harsh, kinetic, almost graceful violence. And Pollack's sure direction, both of his actors and the specific events of the world they live in, bring 'The Yakuza' to vivid life, aided immeasurably by a marvelous screenplay by Leonard Schraeder, Paul Schraeder, and Robert Towne, and by the evocative musical score by Dave Grusin which perfectly captures the mysterious beauty of modern day Japan.    Butbe mindful of the fact that, by today's standards, the pacing of this film is very leisurely and measured. The same is equally true of other late 60's, early 70's classics like 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Conversation', and, to a degree, even 'The Exorcist'. In other words, 'The Yakuza' requires patience to let the story unfold in its own time. But the up-side is that this patience will be amply rewarded.    Interestingly, it's worth noting that Ridley Scott paid blatant homage to Pollack's film many years later in his own 'Black Rain', a very stylish (though inferior), slickly entertaining action film also set in modern day Japan. In addition to featuring many of the same story elements, including a plot dealing heavily with the Yakuza (though TONS of films also deal with that), the movie co-stars none other than Ken Takakura! And, both in Takakura's stoic resignation and moral authority, AND in his character's complicated relationship with his reluctant American partner (Michael Douglas), Scott tips his hat more than once to Pollack's undeservedly overlooked gem.    The somewhat barebones Warner Bros. DVD, at last does long overdo justice to the film's wide screen compositions and the lush yet elegantly understated cinematography of Kozo Okazaki, both bringing out the formalized, ritual beauty of Japanese culture and lifestyle.    Additionally, the bonus materials consist of a marvelous audio commentary by the late Sydney Pollack himself, giving much welcome insight into the film's production, and a \\"vintage\\" featurette (from which I derived the title of my review). But don't let that \\"vintage\\" throw you off. Like me, you'd probably expect the usual 1970's light, puff-piece, studio PR department 5-minute promo. But it turns out that the 'Promises To Keep' featurette is a much longer, more in-depth making-of piece, with a surprising amount of input from Pollack (he even narrates), as well as lots of behind-the-scenes footage both of rehearsals and the actual shooting.A film that is like no other, you pass up `The Yakuza' at your peril. You really don't want to make the mistake of dismissing this gem as some 70's relic. After all, 'The Godfather' and 'Chinatown' are also of that particular \\"vintage\\"!

B000ZK4466|3.0|This album is more musically precise than previous efforts, though I have to say that i don't feel like i'm  hearing anything new. The band tends to be simply put: irritating, overblown, too many riffs and not enough melody, along with the annoying singer who doesn't seem to get less annoying. I am a huge fan of experimental and progressive rock and I know that The Mars Volta has originality and ability, though in reality it isn't really anything new. The Mars Volta slab of noisy rock and roll isn't for everybody.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|First the good parts: This thing looks amazing! It allows you to store profiles for every separate game you run and can even color code the LCD display so that it changes to a particular color for each profile or game. When you install the setup, it automatically looks for every supported game on your computer and sets it up for use on the pad. It's ergonomically great and every key is programmable to customize for your own taste. It even has a joystick that you can move with your thumb to move your characters around. It takes a little getting used to, but it works.<br /><br />The only downside I can see to this is the size of the keys themselves. They are not laid out perfectly like a keyboard, and as a result you'll have to \\"retrain\\" your fingers. If you're used to quickly hitting the \\"Tab\\" button from the standard \\"WADS\\" running key combo, you're going to quickly get frustrated because the button assigned to that spot isn't \\"Tab\\". You'll need to do a little tweaking to make it all work for your individual taste, but the pad is so easy to program (the software makes it incredibly simple) that it would be hard to mess it up.<br /><br />If you're a serious gamer, this is definitely something to add to your arsenal.
6304698682|4.0|This was a solid western, one of many through the years from Clint Eastwood, who knows how to make an entertaining film.    \\"Pale Rider\\" is almost like a modern-day \\"Shane,\\" in which the quiet stranger enters to help the picked-on landowners and then winds up with a showdown with the evil men in town. In this film, Eastwood plays a \\"preacher,\\" (that's all he's called in this movie, but he's really a gunfighter) who saves the day for the town miners, led by Michael Moriarty.    There are a lot of mixed moral messages in this film. A couple of things, however, for sure: 1 - the interesting characters; 2 - the convincing bad guys; 3 - the beautiful scenery and photography; 4 - the involving story that makes you care what happens. All of these make this an entertaining film you would watch a number of times.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The miniseries John Adams is a terrific story of John Adams, one of the original Founding Fathers, his family, and the people he knew and interacted with. Paul Giamatti is incredible in the title role as John Adams;  Laura Linney is also wonderful as Abigail Adams.  Their story moved me to tears in the end and left me wanting to know more about them and others who were instrumental in the founding of our country. Added bonuses are the brief vignettes showing the making of the series. I hope that others will come away from it as I did wanting to know more and with a renewed appreciation for these people and what they went through. I loved it and I highly recommend it.

B001FB55H6|5.0|Very rarely does a movie come out that challenges all the quintessential themes of a specific genre.  In all other comic book or graphic novel adaptations, there is a seamlessness with which the transition to film takes place.  The stories translate, the characters remain relatively untouched.  Normally, everything follows the lead of previous editions.  Prepare for that lazy, albeit typically enjoyable, method of delivery to be flipped on its head.<br /><br />The plot is almost stereotypically hero versus villain.  The bad guys come up with an ingenious plan, and the good guys eventually prevail.  Amazingly, however, the dismally dark portrayal of heroes, and the glossy veneer of villains, flips convention on its head.  In a world that has eschewed superheroes and driven them into hiding, a believable life alteration is necessary - this is NOT Superman simply putting on glasses and becoming Clark Kent.<br /><br />The casting and acting for The Watchmen is infallibly perfect.  Each character delivers the overall purpose and essence of their character with flair and subtlety.<br /><br />Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is perfect in his role as a Batman in Dockers.  The most at peace with his forced retirement, he's old fashioned, and looks like a chemistry professor.<br /><br />Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre was a tad boring, but overall she conveyed the true meaning of the character, the sultry, cute, vulnerable superhero following in her mother's footsteps.  Carla Gugino is an aged crime-fighter who misses the old days and reminisces through her daughter.  Fans of her performance in Sin City will not be surprised by the Gugino flashback sequences in which she blisters the screens.<br /><br />The Comedian is perhaps the darkest of all heroes ever imagined.  He's vile yet he fights on the \\"good\\" side.  Completely comfortable with the \\"break an egg to make an omelette\\"-philosophy, he blurs the line between black and white, and could easily be seen as protagonist as well as sociopathic antagonist.<br /><br />Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is a very compelling mastermind.  He believes his purpose is just, so his outward intentions do not come off as foreboding.  His choirboy looks only enforce the fact that he believes in his twisted intentions to save the world.  I'm unsure if the character's name is inspired by the poem, but the connection between each person's perception of invincibility, and eventual demise, is what creates each character's legacy.  In many ways Ozymandias could be viewed as The Comedian on a much grander scale.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley's performance as Rorschach is absolutely one of my favorite performances of all time.  His brutal, madman form of justice is more enjoyable than DeNiro's character in Taxi Driver, more misanthropic towards contemporary culture than Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, and a better comic transformation than Ledger's Joker.  It's amazing to think that the pipsqueak from Bad News Bears could be so convincingly rugged, so disturbed.<br /><br />The one major flaw to this movie is the fact that Dr. Manhattan's digitally designed genitalia is on-screen roughly 50 times.  It's completely unnecessary and distracting.  Otherwise, I loved this movie; it's monumental, exciting, action-packed, and meaningful.  I highly recommend this movie for not only comic book fans, but anyone interested in an incredible story told through the lens of stunning cinematography.thew Goode) is a very compelling mastermind.

B001P3SA94|5.0|I enjoyed this movie having actually overheard a lot of the basics of the content when all this was actually happening.  To see it unfold in a well made movie version was awesome for me. Most movies leave some things out but at least this was well done.  Do Chess's family really want the real deal out there where as this movie is nice to him but we know in reality he cheated his artists. That part is glossed over. It is being reported not only here but in the news that it is not 100% on the mark so I say to viewers keep that in mind with any movie based on or inspired by a true story. Facts can overload and take away from a story.  I'm looking forward to seeing my own book made into a movie and hope I agree with the results.

B0002ADXYI|5.0|When I grew up (a long time ago...) I listened to this record of my older brother a lot. I liked the simplicity of the guitar riffs, the beautiful voice of the singer (now in the angel's choir), and the dramatic organ accompaniment (though I was always drawn to electric guitar which I played since I was 17). I don't like many keyboard players, probably just Jon Lord, whoever Blackmore had on the live Rainbow double-LP, and above all Ken Hensley of the Heep, a true musical genius, especially when he picks up his slide and plays the most ferocious slide guitar solos in rock history (starting on this LP with \\"Real Turned On\\" and bringing to absolute perfection in \\"Tears in my eyes\\" on the next LP \\"Look At Yourself\\").     This CD has all the original LP songs in flawless sound quality and then some extras that I don't care too much for. The liner notes are pretty interesting. Looks like Uriah Heep was pretty much disliked by the music critics early on, not sure why. I think David Byron and Ken Hensley are the absolute cream of singer/keyboard player ever in rock music. Mick Box on guitar was just solid, very good sound, simple riffs, not too exiting in the solo department. They had very good songs. Not sure what the critics thought.
0525951113|4.0|I agree with a lot of the other reviews in the assessment of the structure of the book. It starts off very strongly and is plausible at the outset, but it devolves too quickly into such a mind-blowing assault that you can't believe it's remotely plausible unless you know very little about the underlying technology. Also, there is just too much going on at once in the last half the book and I didn't find it as interesting as the first 1/3rd. It would translate well into a modern action-thriller where there's a sustained climax of explosions going off left, right, and centre and you're just mesmerized by the whole thing and the story is no longer being told because it's buried under the theatrics. That's not my kind of thing, but for people who like it then it might work. The first 1/3rd is good as a book, and the last half would be better as a movie. The missing 1/6th is just... \\"so what?\\".    It is undoubtedly implausible. Anyone who knows anything about software knows that for the millions of interactions and coincidences that take place here to take place in real life without substantial real-world testing and engineering would be impossible -- especially when you throw untrained people into the equation. Even with testing, the whole thing would be tripped up by a few critical glitches that weren't anticipated. It just wouldn't happen...    In the end, though, I gave it 4 stars for its innovation and its synthesis of a believable fictional environment based on real or plausible technology. Despite being too implausible as a whole (especially in the last half of the book), there is a solid technical core to it and it doesn't habitually compromise the technical core for the sake of easy storytelling.

B001PJ7TUE|5.0|[[VIDEOID:33266561]]Prodigy have long been off the top of the charts but they finally manage to come back and garner attention across the globe. Catchy tracks such as \\"Smack My ***** Up\\" and \\"Firestarter\\" were what captivated the world the first time around when The Prodigy released their to date best selling album [[ASIN:B000002NFM The Fat of the Land]]. They have since experimented quite a bit and fell off the radar a bit and even alienated some fans, but the boys are back and in fine form.<br /><br />'Invaders Must Die' reminds me of [[ASIN:B000002NFM The Fat of the Land]] in that it's songs are catchy yet hold enough originality to not come off as the band trying their hardest to get back in the spotlight. The albums first two singles 'Omen' and the album's title track are exactly what the band needed to push the album beyond their UK fan base. Both songs border on popish Techno but push their original style enough to set them apart, 'Omen' is in my opinion one of Prodigy's most mature and addictive tracks to date.<br /><br />The music on IMD keeps a fast beat beginning to end and each track stands on it's own. The major difference between IMD and the rest of their discography is that vocals are much more prominent on IMD then previous releases, almost every track has singing or vocals of some sort. \\"Colours\\" has a chorus that will probably be heard on dance floors world wide for years and is also one of my personal favorites on the album. Also I would advise getting your hands on an imported version as they come with some amazing bonus tracks.<br /><br />All in all in my humble opinion this is The Prodigy's best release and is easily the most accessible to a wide range of music lovers. New fans of the group definitely need to check out their older material but be cautious as this album stands out against the gritty more experimental sound of earlier releases. Old fans may be a bit alienated due to the extreme contrast to previous albums but I think most will appreciate Invaders Must Die as much as I do. Be sure to check out the video for Omen that I included with my review, it's their best video to date. Thanks for reading and I hope my review has helped your choice to purchase this album.<br /><br />-A loyal Prodigy fan.ie as much as I do.

0312360266|5.0|This is one of those books that's so bad it's good.  I don't mean that in a disparaging way - just that Marked and the HON series is so completely earnest and so over the top it is hysterical.  It's clever and refreshing in a way many vampire novels written today are not.      The Cast's try to be subtle with the anti-drug and anti-drinking messages - but they are really completely over the top.  Zoey doesn't like her boyfriend's drinking because he'll just end up with a beer belly and she won't smoke pot \\"because why would I do something that would just cause me to eat fattening foods\\" So funny!  How can you not love it!

B001MW0J2Y|5.0|I'll start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of John Frusciante's solo output with my favorites being 'Niandra Lades', 'DC EP', 'Curtains' and 'Shadows Collide'.  'The Empyrean' is quite a bit different from his previous output.  It's more dreamy and certainly more esoteric (if you can believe that anything can be more esoteric than 'Niandra' :)    I had to give it a few listens before I really connected with it.  It really is an album that should be listened in its entirety to fully appreciate.     It's an interesting meld of melodic and experimental styles all at once:  Quiet, then hits you over the head, then sends you off on a journey and so on.    If you're a John Frusciante fan this is a definite must.  If you're looking to delve into his solo work for the first time, you may want to check out 'Shadows Collide' or 'Curtains' for a start then move onto 'Niandra' and 'Empyrean'.  Of course, this all depends on your taste as I find all of his output superior and unique work that is unparalleled in this day and age of manufactured corporate music.    Give this brilliant musician a try, you won't regret it!

B0000A0DRY|5.0|Just got around to listening to this remaster and it is fantastic! Though I thoughly enjoyed it, I am going whip out my mono CD version and give it a listen again and see if it betters the fantastic mono album mix. I prefer the mono version because of the added echo that was added to the stereo mix. I still say this one really is pretty good and the bonus tracks could have easily made the final cut if it was not for the vinyl space alotted in the day. I heard this one, Sgt Pepper and The Doors all around the same time and these were great albums. I played this one the least and The Doors the most, but Pepper, I played \\"A Day In The Life\\" the most of any of the songs. Back to this one, Love the tracks \\"My Best Friend\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\" the most, except the single mono version is better to me.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This is an awesome example of the way a movie in BD format should look like. Even though it was shot with grain (since some people are complaining), this does not mean the movie looks bad. In fact, it shows amazing black level, incredible contrast, awesome detail and color.    You will be able to see every hair in Leonidas' beard, perfect detail in the water and overall beautiful photography. This is a truly great transfer. Also, the sound is impeccable.    Recomend it.
B0013ND30M|5.0|In common with most of my fellow \\"late boomers\\" who were born in the late 1950s, I have fond memories of the Disney films of that era.  \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\\" were the two animated Disney productions which were first released in our early childhoods.  I am  extraordinarily fond of \\"Dalmatians\\", and while I am less enamored of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", I still find in it much to enjoy.  The newly restored version available in the Platinum Edition is magnificently colored and beautifully restored.  Gems flash, silks shine, and the textures of wood and stone are wonderfully real.  Tchaikovsky's music never sounded better.  Emotions run at a high level throughout the film and culminate in the exciting battle between Prince Philip and Maleficient.  As I watched the Platinum Edition for the first time I realized with some surprise that many of my early mental images of Middle earth, as I read J.R.R. Tolkien's books in the late 1960s and early 1970s, were subconsciously influenced by my exposure to \\"Sleeping Beauty!\\"<br /><br />\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is very much a product of its time.  Aurora/Briar Rose has the same preoccupation every young woman fifty years ago was supposed to have: find the perfect Prince who will carry her away. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, (most girls knew better then and now, of course) but it does make for an interesting contrast with \\"Dalmatians,\\" which though released just a couple of years later has many more female characters with much more developed personalities.<br /><br />I'll rewatch and enjoy \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" many times.  The additional material, including information on the elaborate production process, is interesting, too.  But what I'll find most intriguing will be the contrast between  prevailing assumptions in the mid-twentieth and the early twenty-first centuries.
1577656865|5.0|I picked up this copy of the classic novel when I was only a child and enjoyed it immensely. What amazed me was how it actually DID tell the entire story as Shelly wrote it, without eliminating any details. This was always a fine series for kids and the artwork was always good as well, this one being a standout. The Monster within does actually resemble the text rather than something Karloffian,as is usually the case and even the gruesome moments are captured quite well. That cover is a beaut, depicting one of the few takes on Christopher Lee's Monster from Hammer's \\"Curse of Frankenstein\\"(1957) and it's pretty cool. The only problem with this book is Amazon's terrible price for it. Most retailers sell it for five dollars or under and i've seen it(and it's Paperback counterpart) in several Dollar and Bargain stores. This book is a great addition to any Horror fan's Frankenstein collection and for kids interested in the story.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Throughout her illustrious acting career, Kate Winslet has created a delectable smorgasbord of compelling characters in movies such as Sense and Sensibility, Titanic, Hamlet.<br /><br />I would not say Hanna in The Reader is delectable, yet the story more than the character has compelling qualities. Kate Winslet has gained<br />some overdue statuary, and a well deserved fifth Oscar nomination, and finally a highly deserved Oscar.<br /><br />Act 1 opens with The Innocent yet Illicit Love Affair, an act of kindness to a 15 year old boy caught out sick in the storm. It helps to know in advance that it happens after the second world war.<br /><br />The love scenes are candid and authentic, and for a while, we feel we can empathise with her. For the boy David, it's a sexual awakening that will direct his life. He expands her imagination by reading her the classics. Her passion and initial kindness is tempered by a perplexing coldness. It ends with her unannounced disappearance.<br /><br />Act 2, The Trial, contains the meat of the story, explores the worst aspects of human behavior. Her coldness now becomes understood in the light of new and incriminating information, quite an inhuman portrait. Yet a new perplexity emerges, her seeming unwillingness to save herself. Here we have the crucial decisions made by her and her former lover. Will she help herself? Will Michael help her?<br /><br />Act 3: The Aftermath.<br /><br />On an emotional level, it is an exploration of fear, guilt and shame, and the consequences when we act out of these emotions.<br /><br />On a more personal level is the question, what would we do?<br /><br />There is a quotation by George Santayana: Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br />I must mention David Kross as the young Michael, a very promising performance from this actor. In fact, because of German law he had to wait till he turned 18 before filming the steamier scenes.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.
B001PPLIFU|2.0|I have been a long time James bond fan and I was introduced to Bond when Pierce Brosnan did Goldeneye. My dad had all of the movies on VHS and I spent a weekend with him watching everything Bond. I was hooked! I am a firm believer that no one will ever replace Sean Connery as Bond but Pierce came pretty close to being the best Bond. Daniel Craig came to the Franchise and I was disappointed in his portrayal of bond but Casino Royal was decent. I was so displeased with his performance that Quantum of Solace was the first bond movie my Dad and I didn't bother to see in theaters. I went ahead and bought it on Blu-Ray because I own all of the Bond movies no matter how bad they were (Timothy Dalton movies were the worst). I watched it and was bored through most of the movie. It was slow to start and again, I am really disappointed with Craig as Bond. If you are a fan of his it is a must have, if you are a bond fan I would ask if you are like me and have to own them all like myself, or if you could stand to save your money and rent it.   I was also disappointed in the Blu-Ray release, the special features were lacking and it was nothing special. Most of the Blu-rays that have come out have more  special features that you can't get on DVD so I guess my expectations for this was just to high.
1881273156|5.0|As a engaged couple, our pastor gave this book to us as homework.  I am glad he did.  It really seemed to be a great resource for now and in the future as our relationship evolves.  We both have a copy of the book and it has sparked a lot of open discussion and thoughts.  I feel better prepared going into marriage now.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|It was an entertaining movie with a bunch of action.  I heard that it was a good movie from some friends and family and they were right.  There were some nice and some interesting cars in this movie and I felt like I wanted to try some drifting myself.
0316067601|5.0|I very much enjoyed this read, not because it was expertly written or because it contained literary prose that was new and exciting but because it was honest.  Marcus tells a solemn story that graphically illustrates what our service men see on a daily basis in Afganistan.   His thoughts poured onto the pages in a way that made me feel like I was sitting next to him while he told the story.  For those that said it was \\"too pro Bush\\"  \\"too anti liberal\\" or that it was based to much on opinions and not facts I have to ask if you actually read the book and understood it, or did you get to the first thing that you didn't personally agree with and doom the author from there on out?      This book was excellent, and if you are on the fence about reading it I suggest you just dive in because you will not be able to put it down.  I read it in one week, the 3/4 of which was in 2 days.
B001LOU6ZS|4.0|This 1982 release, which went top ten,  was the bands strongest studio release since their last cd with Michael Schenker: 1978's \\"Obsession\\".  The band starts off with a solid rock classic 'the writer\\" which describes the now vanishing power broker newspaper or magazine writer who can make or break careers in music or politics.  And from there to the end of the disc there isn't a filler song to be found.  \\"Feel it\\" is probably the standout hard rock track on here; it can hold it's own with the best of their whole output.<br />There is even a superior ballad on here 'back into my life\\". This is highly skilled and top notch metal the kind in which you expect good playing and singing. And this would be the bands last great disc until<br />1995's 'walk on water\\" .  The best thing is however the many bonus tracks on this disc and that makes this a better buy than ever.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Annie has been a family favorite for years. The songs are catchy, and there's plenty of glitz and glamor to spare. The positivity is the best part; even though Annie is obviously in a miserable place, her can-do attitude and her optimism are as good for a bad day as a bowl of chicken-noodle soup is for a sick friend.    Every single song is downright catchy. I often find myself humming them. And as for the choreography, it's usually wonderful and unique.    Although I've heard that some have issues with the casting, I've always found it completely believable. Carol Burnett definitely does the best job among her fellow actors, so much so that it's difficult to see anybody else in the role of Ms. Hannigan at all. Bernadette Peters is quite excellent, and Albert Finney makes a grand blustering Daddy Warbucks. \\"Annie\\" herself is just perfect: what a great little actress!    The story itself is very basic, but very enjoyable. The idea is that a ragamuffin of an orphan is \\"adopted for a week\\" by the richest man in America, and they end up becoming the best of friends. It has the air of a fairytale; many elements of the story, like the characters of the Asp and Punjab, are colorful and fantastic indeed. Now, if you'll excuse the fact that Annie's good luck is a little too good (the whole universe seems ready to bend over backwards for her), you'll find her character and story quite enjoyable. Perhaps this is because she's so kind to everyone around her; she never seems to become too saccharine. In any case, when I was a kid, I liked to imagine that I was Annie... street-smart, optimistic, opportunistic, and talented, too.    There are negatives, unfortunately. If you're looking for tight choreography, well, Annie doesn't quite deliver. \\"Hard Knock Life\\" is full of acrobatics that never quite mesh, and girls whose moves should, and do not, match up. However, this incongruity usually seems limited to the dancing of the kiddos; the adult routines are downright lovely. It's like they weren't as picky with the children's accuracy, which is a bit sad.    There are also some parts of the film that just makes one feel a bit queasy. Burnett plays her scenes to perfection. Perhaps she plays them a little too perfectly! Ms. Hannigan is a low-life drunk, to be sure, but wow! Burnett gave the character a bizarre likability and attractive personality; nonetheless, I always found myself eager for her scenes to be over, even when I was a kid. She's the epitome of depression, and her scenes--as well as those of the post-Annie orphanage--are always big let-downs. They are stark reminders that Annie's fantasy is just that: a fantasy. The ending doesn't really make up for it, either. What could (and should) be a happy joyride all the way through is tainted with this sick reminder that this is just a movie. Now, I don't expect all of my entertainment to be happy, but in a movie like this, the effect is jarring, and the only word I can use to describe it is \\"bipolar.\\" \\"I'm a happy wish-fulfilling movie where everyone's dreams come true and every single person in the universe can jump into song and dance at any moment! OH NO, WAIT! I'm reality now! Death waits for you with cold fingers!\\"    Really, as much as I have gone on about them, the negatives are slight in comparison to the overwhelming positive air surrounding Annie. I watched it religiously as a child and the wonder still hasn't worn off on me today. I pop it in regularly when I need a pick-me-up.ie where everyone's dreams come true and every single person in the universe can jump into song and dance at any moment! OH NO, WAIT! I'M REALITY NOW! GOSH, THAT SUCKS, HUH!\\"    Also, this really should be a kid's movie. So why, dear heavens why, are there so many creepy sexual overtones? Why, why, why must we have panty shots? Look, in the musical Chicago, such things made SENSE because that was an adult musical. In this, it just comes across as crass and seems done in very poor taste indeed.    Really, as much as I have gone on about them, the negatives are slight in comparison to the overwhelming positive air surrounding Annie. There's something so magnetic about this film, and in the final act, one is positively glued to the screen. Overall, this is a fabulous movie. I watched it religiously as a child and the wonder still hasn't worn off on me today. I pop it in regularly when I need a pick-me-up.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith has done it again!  This record is filled with fantastic songs.  It is a 'feel good' album that lifts my spirits.  The depth of the lyrics touch me each and every time I listen.  'Thank You' is beyond words.  Nicole is one lucky lady!  And 'thank you', Keith, for a fantastic musical work!!
B001LRJH0U|4.0|Great scenery, storyline seemed a bit light and sometimes awkward but the costuming and scenery was very authentic. Ed Harris does a good job as does Viggo.
0060797509|4.0|This is a classic that has been read by generations of readers. It is the beginning of Laura Ingalls Wilder's tales of frontier life. Set in the \\"Big Woods\\" of Wisconsin in the 1870s, the story is told from the point of view of five-year-old Laura, the middle sister of three, who lives with her parents in a log cabin where her father earns his living as a trapper.<br /><br />Wilder describes life in the 1870s in painstaking detail that keeps the story interesting without ever bogging down the pacing. The story takes the reader through a year in the life of the family, from the harvest and storing of food for the winter, through the Christmas celebrations, and the playful days of summer.<br /><br />All of the family's work and play is described, with the occasional tall tale from Pa Ingalls, often told with a lesson in mind for the girls. The cycle of the year forms the structure and plot of the story, although the central conflict involves Laura's struggle with her jealous feelings toward her older sister.<br /><br />There is humor and tenderness spread throughout the story, as well as a constant subtle tension as the reader is reminded of how fragile life on the frontier can be. The family has only themselves to rely on. Neighbors and relatives are distant, and the nearest town is far enough away that they only make one trip to town in a year. The story does not dance around the realities of hunting and raising animals for food. In fact, the first chapter is devoted mostly to the butchering of the family's hog.<br /><br />Wilder's talent for description makes this an educational story, but her considerable skills as a storyteller give us characters that we care about as they live their lives in the Big Woods.

0743277465|3.0|I saw an interview with Josh on Google Authors series. I was hoping for more of an essay on learning theory. Instead, it was more of an autobiography - an interesting read, but not an applicable as I had hoped for.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|I picked this up because it was free and I have not read it in years so I thought it would be a good choice to learn to navigate with on my K2. I tried differnt methods but I really enjoyed readimg along with TTS. Beacuse the language is dated ( though in a good way ) it can make it a little tiring in places. With the TTS on I sailed through this book and loved it.
0307454894|4.0|You can read this book very quickly.  It took me an hour.  The sex turns to nothing, the love evaporates, and still you keep reading until you can't figure out what you would do if.  You feel the narrator's young pain.  Sitting in the courthouse encountering the former Nazi who was his lover, you wonder what you would have done.  Shame, love, grief, consume narrator and reader.

B000002VQQ|4.0|this is a seminal album along with Talking Head's '77 for a major shift in the music zeitgeist from 70's disco Beegees type music to punk and New Wave of the 80's.  Both bands came out of NY and CGBG's.  Patti Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and became an overnight sensation.  Already an established poet, her collaboration with Lenny Kaye holds up well after all these years, and her cover of GLORIA puts the classic version to shame.  No rock collection is complete without it.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Wow! This show is incredibly addicting. An extremely well scripted and well acted, dark drama. The stories are engaging, and full of plot lines and twists, that frequently employ Murphy's law. (If something can go wrong it will)  Mr white, is a 50 yr old high school chemistry teacher, who much like his soon to be partner Jessie, is an underachiever given his smarts and abilities.   Mr White's mid life crisis, combined with some overwhelming bad news forces him to take some drastic actions. Its intriguing and somewhat perverse to watch an otherwise Good Man go bad. While teaching he gives some beautiful dialogue about chemical reactions that mirrors what's happening in his life.  The show is very realistic and despite its dark themes, still manages to include occasional humor.   Really superbly done. The second season is also excellent, and grows the show's story.  The only downside is that there are only seven episodes in the first season due to the writers strike.
B001GJOL22|5.0|Great sound; well mixed and recorded.    HD video is superior. The editing is great with the focus on the whichever person is doing a significant part at the time. Example: Excellent shots of Neil. drum solo's,   Alex's guitar work, and Lee's bass/keyboard. Also great overall stage presentation.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Kind of a weak/bland CD with no distinct jazz-like performance or moments of inspiration. This is good elevator music and the interpretations of  Tom Jobim's Bossa Nova standards are very forgetable and totally butcher the music from the illustrous composer. The syrupy arrangement by Claus Orgerman are in poor taste!Don't buy this CD!!!!!!!
0790742314|5.0|Their shipping was faster than expected.  The movie was in awesome shape and I've already played it over a dozen times.  I have kids and they have sleep-overs almost every weekend.
B001HYY35G|3.0|For those of you wanting a great headphone album, this isn't it. The audio is rather poor (to think of an mp3 analog, think 160kbps). A great album from a great act. Soulwax (Part of the Weekend...) and Daft Punk (Alive 2007) do a better job of keeping the fidelity high.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Great movie! If you are a history buff or a causal fan this is a wonderful movie on the life of John Adams and our countries beginnings.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|This series shows just how different the lives and the thinking of our Founding Fathers are from our own.  The \\"struggle\\" for Independence was a very narrowly won thing indeed.  The exploration of the relationship between John and Abagail was given a very good treatment.  The other theme worth noting is the concept of honor between men.  The importance of Honor and the human weakness or strengths displayed as a result.  It's a great series to have on hand for a snow-bound weekend.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I am a true Jane Eyre fan.  I have read the book several times and own 4 versions of it on dvd witch I have watched countless times.  I loved this adaptation of Jane Eyre.  I thought Ruth Wilson was perfect for the part.  Toby Stephens was a charming and handsome Mr. Rochester (one of the things that is perhaps not so true to the book;).  He came across as a bit too nice and flirtatious for me,however it made for an entertaining movie.  It added a lot of passion to the story.  When I want a true to the book version-I reach for the Timothy Dalton adaptation, when I want a little more romance and passion-I reach for this one.
B000002UAX|5.0|From The Beatles Webpage<br />4-7-09<br /><br />We are delighted to announce the release of the original Beatles catalogue, which has been digitally re-mastered for the first time, for worldwide CD release on Wednesday, September 9, 2009 (09-09-09), the same date as the release of the widely anticipated \\"The Beatles: Rock Band\\" video game.<br /><br />Each of the CDs is packaged with replicated original UK album art, including expanded booklets containing original and newly written liner notes and rare photos. For a limited period, each CD will also be embedded with a brief documentary film about the album. On the same date, two new Beatles boxed CD collections will also be released.<br /><br />The albums have been re-mastered by a dedicated team of engineers at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London over a four year period utilising state of the art recording technology alongside vintage studio equipment, carefully maintaining the authenticity and integrity of the original analogue recordings. The result of this painstaking process is the highest fidelity the catalogue has seen since its original release.<br /><br />The collection comprises all 12 Beatles albums in stereo, with track listings and artwork as originally released in the UK, and 'Magical Mystery Tour,' which became part of The Beatles' core catalogue when the CDs were first released in 1987. In addition, the collections 'Past Masters Vol. I and II' are now combined as one title, for a total of 14 titles over 16 discs. This will mark the first time that the first four Beatles albums will be available in stereo in their entirety on compact disc. These 14 albums, along with a DVD collection of the documentaries, will also be available for purchase together in a stereo boxed set.<br /><br />Within each CD's new packaging, booklets include detailed historical notes along with informative recording notes. With the exception of the 'Past Masters' set, newly produced mini-documentaries on the making of each album, directed by Bob Smeaton, are included as QuickTime files on each album. The documentaries contain archival footage, rare photographs and never-before-heard studio chat from The Beatles, offering a unique and very personal insight into the studio atmosphere.<br /><br />A second boxed set has been created with the collector in mind. 'The Beatles in Mono' gathers together, in one place, all of the Beatles recordings that were mixed for a mono release. It will contain 10 of the albums with their original mono mixes, plus two further discs of mono masters (covering similar ground to the stereo tracks on 'Past Masters'). As an added bonus, the mono \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" discs also include the original 1965 stereo mixes, which have not been previously released on CD. These albums will be packaged in mini-vinyl CD replicas of the original sleeves with all original inserts and label designs retained.<br /><br />Discussions regarding the digital distribution of the catalogue will continue. There is no further information available at this time.ckTime files on each album.

B001GKJ2E8|1.0|Wanted is a Matrix rip-off without a decent plot or any redeeming qualities other than high octane action, great special effects, and Angelina Jolie.  If that's what you are looking for, this is for you.      The plot - a wimpy nerd finds out his father was an assassin with special powers is whisked away by the fraternity of assassins his father belonged to, and trained to be an assassin himself.  And eventually go after the guy that killed his dad.    Basically this is just a thin plot for action sequences and Angelina Jolie to show off her assets (literally in one scene).    But the plot is so bad and the acting so mundane that for me it took away from being able to enjoy the movie.  It was a wasted two hours.
0060849827|5.0|Some have said the text is too small, it's not.  It's perfectly readable and clear.  I'm including this book in my survival pouch (fanny pack) and bug-out bag (backpack).  The information is well-organized and very helpful.  It contains much of the common sense stuff you might forget as well as everything you could possibly think of to help you survive in the wilderness alone.  The illustrations are very well done and help you to easily understand how to set traps, build shelters, identify edible plants, etc.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book, even though I was at first resistant to the unusual format (written in correspondence) just feeling lazy, really. I am glad I went ahead and ignored that concern. I soon forgot about that and became immersed in the wonderful characters and story. I did not want it to end! It is funny, heartbreaking and inspiring. I loved this line from the book, \\"Men are more interesting in books than they are in real life.\\" So true! LOL! A little reminiscent of 84 Charing Cross Road, which uses a similar format and I also highly recommend.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I have heard Radioheads songs since Pablo Honey. Never really gave any of the albums a chance till yesterday. I would just listen to the RH hit songs on the radio. This album is really honest and so inviting for any level of RH fan. The songs have a real calming mood to them. You can sit back have a joint, cigarette, beer or what have you and melt in your chair. The electronic sound really fits the band well. I give this album 5 stars. My reason for that is I have not heard an album this good in a while. RH goes to show you old dinosaurs don't die they only get better at their craft!
B00005JLKN|5.0|The product arrived in record time and was safely packaged for shipping.  The product was in excellent condition.  I appreciate the easy-to-use process.  Thanks Amazon!
B001PPF12Q|5.0|I have heard some bad remasters. I have already mentioned those in other reviews I have done here, so I won't re-hash that here. You guys gotta realize that remasters and or remixes of albums are not always essential. The older RH albums sound just fine. Last but not least some remasters done these days have the mix volume turned up way way too loud. When in mixers do this to older albums it kind of ruins them. All I can say is appreciate what has been released for you the fans!      Maybe RH don't want their albums messed with just yet. Who knows in the next 20 years maybe they will change their minds and have their catalog remixed. I believe in 20 years time the albums will be in need of a remix and or remaster as the tapes will start to show their age on CD's being made in 20 yrs.
B00005LELD|5.0|Great lens hood. I wasn't sure about a rubber hood at first, but this little guy does a great job, and is really handy.  I'm a big fan of how easily the hood can be collapsed down when not in use.  Great deal.
B001CD6FKI|1.0|This is a shockingly, stunningly, obscenely bad movie.  The story and script were apparently written by mushroom eating manatees. The acting was stilted and it was clear that every one of the cast regretted having signed on for this abomination. The visuals are impressive....assuming you're a big fan of Candyland.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like the plague.  Every movie Uwe Boll ever directed looks like Oscar material compared to this astonishing exercise in putridness.
1423113497|5.0|I bought this set based on the recommendation of my neighbor, a reluctant reader in third grade.  These are the first books that he truly enjoyed, so I picked up this series for my students.  They arrived during spring break, so I figured I would read the beginning of The Lightning Thief so I would be able to recommend them to my students.  Little did I know I would spend the break reading these three books, and ordering the fourth and fifth as well.  Fascinating story, witty with current references, relatable characters, with references to Greek mythology (I assume accuracy, although it was never an interest of mine.)  Highly recommended for young and old readers alike.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|It's not called 'Bossa Nova', or even 'Corcovado'. The blatantly obvious intent of this CD is a soft, lush sound with a gentle bossa nova rhythm. On that, this CD certainly delivers. Some of the other reviewers indicate that they are surprised. \\"What happened?\\" they ask. They needn't ask, the clues are all there.    The question, then is, is this a good CD? The answer is yes. It delivers what is promised. Softly swaying gently jazzy vocals over a well orchestrated background. Is this a great CD? No, and most reviewers seem to agree that Ms. Krall is capable of delivering a great CD. Most of Ms. Krall's best outings are when the backing is spare, and she is given room to swing.

B000SIBH06|5.0|This was the first book by Jodi Picoult that I read and it is still my favorite. It is the only book that I have ever read that made me cry. Not only because it is sad but because it shows a great love between sisters that have all the reasons in the world to hate each other. I'd give this book 10 stars if I could.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|The first serious filmmaker who paid full attention around the complex feminine world was Ingmar Bergman (\\"The silence\\" and \\"Persona\\"), but when Robert Bresson threw his hat to arena with Mouchette (1967), we should wait for Francois Truffaut, Luis Bunuel, Lina Wertmuller, Liliana Cavani The Von Trotta sisters, Percy Aldon  and Rainer Fassbinder during the seventies and eighties the feminine affections resided in Europe as the main gravity creative center. But since the middle eighties, (since Fassbinder's death) the old continent seemed to have given up as main creative exponent (until the successful arrival of \\"The scent of green papaya\\" and \\"Amelie\\") and since then only a fist of selected films have dealt with the emotional feminine universe. As a matter of fact, after the extraordinary Robert Van Ackeren's  \\"The woman in flames\\"(1984), the American cinema has turned its attention around the countless narrative possibilities of this genre. We could cite Norman Jewison's \\"Moonstruck\\" (1987),  Donald Petrie's \\"Mystic pizza\\", (1988), Herbert Ross' \\"Steel magnolias\\" (1989),  Rob Reiner's \\"Misery\\" (1990)\\", Ridley Scott's \\"Thelma and Louise\\" (1991) and \\" Paul Verhoven \\"Basic instinct\\" (1992).  But besides, it would be convenient to remark : in South America there were two names of egregious significance:  the unforgettable Maria Luisa Bamberg's  \\"Camila\\", who passed away in 1992 and the Venezuelan Fina Torres (Oriana our maxim awarded film in Cannes). Both of them explored the feminine nostalgia from different perspectives.<br /><br />Allen has bet again for this distant and European gaze project. The first release was \\"Match Point\\". A worthy and honest proposal, that intends to give birth a new and warm breadth to a variegated crowd of commonplaces in his beloved and admired NYC.<br /><br /> \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is far to be an original proposal. After having explored the conflictive and tempestuous relation in \\"Mighty Aphrodite\\" with Mira Sorvino (who coincidentally won the Academy Award as best Supporting Actress) Woody Allen seems to have been inspired by two almost forgotten Truffaut's films \\"Two English girls\\" (1972) and Ken Russell's \\"Women in love\\" (1970) and a more recent Romantic comedy starred by Diane Lane, \\"Under the Tuscan sun (2003).\\"<br /><br />So he retells a contemporary amorous quartet. An underground painter (Javier Bardem) (signed by a dark affair with her conflictive couple; Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz)) establishes direct contact with two North American girls the alluring Cristina (Scarlet Johansson) a girl who really knows what she doesn't want, a liberal and free thinker, avid to experience in own flesh the Spanish passion far beyond the architecture and the guitar, a modern Aphrodite and her friend Vicky, the mother Goddess who is committed with her North American fianc&eacute;e.<br /><br />This painter is not only a self biographical depiction of his director ; besides epitomizes the ancestral seduction codes and arouses in both of them the mysterious \\"taste of the forbidden\\". In last instance, Allen once more, carves in relief the impossibility for reaching the happiness through the love, due every one of us - and specially the complex feminine universe - expects of this feeling. The arresting landscapes work out and invite as silent background in which the relation of power and self destructive possession, the fascination for the exotic and the breakthrough of the quotidian find in Maria Elena, Cristina and Vicky an interesting but unexpected cocktail of unthinkable passions and a web of questions without answers.<br /><br />The last shot of the film is hardly eloquent.

0143036556|5.0|Diamond had written an excellent volume for our times. I just finished reading the entire book, and enjoyed almost every page. A few technical subjects were hard for me to really enjoy, but overall, Diamond had written a very readable, and well thought-out volume about the strong connection between the environment and civilization. This has provided me with rich food for thought as I contemplate the 4-fold crisis our world is facing: ecological degradation, resource (and energy) depletion, climate change and economic system failure. It's also nice that he ends on a positive note.    The only critique I have of Diamond's writings is that his obvious dislike of Christianity is both painfully and unnecessarily evident. In most places where he mentioned Christianity or religion, he unfortunately conflated it with a particular cultural practice or value, which made me realize that he does not have a good grasp on religion itself -- but no one can be an expert on everything. I teach Christian environmental ethics, and would like to get my students to read at least chapter 16.    I read the Kindle edition on my iPhone, which was okay, but didn't include many of the illustrations, and those that were included are so small as to be useless. The index also did not include page numbers or any links. The print copy is much more valuable than the Kindle edition.

I get that sex is part of the human experience, but I don't personally need an author to paint softcore pornography in my head to get the idea.  This book is thick with overly descriptive sexual encounters that are unnecessary to the core plot.
B000ZN802W|5.0|I purchased the book as well as the movie from Amazon. I read the book first then shared it with my best friend, my daughter. She and her husband watched the movie first while I read the book. We all loved the movie and the book. It's sad, but very true. It gives the reader and watcher something to ponder about. We all decided that this is a definate must have for libraries of both book and video. I am so happy that I purchased both. I will watch it and read it again.

Plus, he has a fantastic voice and the background music is amazing!Every song on this album is a winner. I could listen to it over and over. I highly recommend \\"Anthology\\" for anyone who loves romance and good music.
0375826726|2.0|This book was a major dissapointment. It is much longer than it needs to be. Paolini uses too much flowery, fantasy words that come of as a bit corny. It is littered with rhetorical dialogue and descriptions that could be completely removed and nothing would be lost. The dialogue provides no real characterization either. In other words, all characters sound the same. The style of writing as a whole gets repetative. I think Paolini has great ideas floating around in his head but has a tendency to overwrite. He needs to learn how to make his writing more concise and meaningful.

B001RQ0SJO|5.0|It's like climbing a long velvet rope sewn with golden charms and jewels. That description sums up the experience of listening to Bat For Lashes (aka Natasha Khan), even in her lesser songs. And fortunately \\"Two Suns\\" doesn't really have any lesser songs -- just a steady stream of painfully exquisite, crystalline pop that focus on the feeling of love that's gone.<br /><br />\\"In the street's broadways I seek... him whom my soul loveth,\\" she sings softly in the introductory song, before switching to a mix of tribal drums and wafting keyboard. .<br /><br />After that, she spreads out into a string of love songs -- in fact, this entire album is pretty heavy on those. Most are bittersweet descriptions of an affair falling apart (\\"I drove past true love once, in a dream/Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed\\"), but there are some beautifully idealistic moments as well.<br /><br />Along the way, Khan dabbles in some stompy synthy dance, a hymnlike freak-folk ballad backed by a choir, and the warmly off-kilter \\"Traveling Woman,\\" and a finale that evokes old wooden stages, toy pianos and an old theatre being shut down (\\"No more spotlights/coming down from heaven... and already my voice is fading/goodbye, my dears/and into the big city...\\").<br /><br />Fortunately she doesn't abandon her signature sound, which is that of an old fantasy story mutating into a beautiful, slightly wicked dream -- swirling pop, haunting piano ballads, the soaring and unnerving echoes of \\"Siren\\" and its synth-studded companion \\"Pearl's Song,\\" ethereal melodies swathed in shimmering keyboard, and the exotic sweet danciness of \\"Two Planets.\\" But the absolute peak of the whole thing has to be \\"Daniel,\\" an catchily effervescent ode to a man with a \\"flame in his heart.\\"<br /><br />One of the biggest questions that comes to mind when listening to \\"Two Suns\\" is -- why is the music industry flooded with no-talent pop hacks, when such exquisitely vibrant music is right there for the listening? It's an album with stunning vocals and instrumentation, and lyrics that evoke images of forests on fire, magicians, crystal cities, and an alter ego Khan calls Pearl (who is either a femme fatale or a fantasy traveler).<br /><br />Khan's music is, if possible, even more beautiful than before, mainly because she's managed to polish the instrumentals even further.  In most songs she weaves together a shimmering wall of hauntingly silky keyboard with drums, violins, sharp beats and painfully pretty piano, but sometimes she also pares it down to the bare essentials (\\"Peace of Mind\\").<br /><br />But Khan's voice is one of the loveliest things in this album -- she can sing powerfully or wistfully, and she even shows that she can manage a song almost a capella (\\"Peace of Mind\\" again). Her songwriting is even better: she can conjure powerful emotions with vivid swathes of words (\\"I drove past true love once, in a dream/Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed\\"). It's almost sensual.<br /><br />\\"Two Suns\\" is a lush, lovely album that shows how much Natasha Khan's music has grown in the last year, and reminds you of the dark, beautiful places just out of reach.nd instrumentation, and lyrics that evoke images of forests on fire, magicians, crystal cities, and an alter ego Khan calls Pearl (who is either a femme fatale or a fantasy traveler).

0316017922|5.0|I enjoyed both of Gladwells previous books, but was hesitant to pick up Outliers. When I browsed through it at the bookstore it just didn't grab me. I finally ordered it through Amazon and read it this past weekend.    Gladwell, especially in this book, tends to meander through all types of information, but in the end seems to tie the pieces nicely together. He may not appreciate it but I think he brings it together like the scattered parts of a Seinfeld episode.    Most of the books I read tend to be step-by-step marketing or management books. Outliers has nothing that I can take out and use in the business world. The word that comes to mind when discussing this book is intriguing. It forced me to go outside my everyday thoughts and look at divergent ideas.    To me that makes for some very enjoyable reading.
0800177975|3.0|[[ASIN:0800177975 The Last Action Hero]]    I am one of the people who grew up watching this movie. Overall this is actually a good action film. Anyone who doesn't like it, obviously didn't get that it was meant to be a satire of all the typical, cliches of action films.     John McTiernan, whether or not it was his approach, knew that the only way to truly satirize something, you must be as close to the subject matter as possible. Although he directed such great action films as Die Hard, Predator and The Hunt For Red October, he still manages to pull off his style and being true to the genre, while still managing to turn out a smart parody.    I am one for urging Sony Pictures to release an anniversary edition of this film, to be represented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and having a DTS mix in it as well. All fans of the film at least deserve that much. along with some interesting new special features with more then just a trailer.
0385340990|5.0|What a great book.  It is written in a way that captures the reader instantly.  The format is unique and I have encouranged many of my friends to read this wonderful work.

B000BW7QX6|4.0|Thank god for \\"Serenity,\\" because it nicely wraps up most of the questions that were left hanging when the series that spawned it, \\"Firefly,\\" was abruptly canceled. In an extremely tight storyline, the \\"Firefly\\" story wraps up nicely, and the loose ends left are either intentionally left that way for effect or are relatively minor.<br /><br />That is also the greatest weakness of \\"Serenity\\" - without the foreknowledge from the series, the plot picks up in medias res, and you end up wondering how a lot of things came to be. The main villain, who wields a sword (anachronistic but cool), seems kind of tossed in at the last minute, and though he fleshes out nicely at the end, I can't shake the feeling that he was somehow fake (and strikingly similar to the villain from the final episode of \\"Firefly\\").<br /><br />That said, this DVD is full screen, and suffers for it - get the widescreen edition. The extras are plentiful and include a fun Joss Whedon commentary, deleted scenes and a few outtakes.<br /><br />My advice: watch a few episodes of \\"Firefly\\" first. You'll find out if this is up your alley and you'll get some much-needed backstory.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|Im a Dc comics fans and a huge fan of Batman. I own the vhs and dvd versions of these films so of coarse I had to upgrade to the blu-ray version. Since I own these films on the other formats I could instantly tell the difference in audio and picture quality as soon as I put them in. The picture and audio quality gets better with each film. If you are a fan of Batman and these film you will not be disappointed.

B000K62Q3S|5.0|For me, this is a truly worthy package of a monumental album - Beggars Banquet is often cited as being the Stones greatest album, not just because it contains some great songs, but because it marks the band's triumphant return to form after unsuccessfully experimenting with Psych/Prog rock on their preceding release, Their Satanic Majesty's Request. CD Maximum has released the Stones entire catalog (both London and Decca), all with extra tracks included. It shocks me that Abkco is either too dumb or too greedy to figure out that this type of format (with bonus tracks) is the best way to re-issue their catalog. Capitol seems to have gotten this memo. Anyways, the sound quality is pristine, all tracks are in stereo, except Prodigal Son, which, as always, appears in mono. This track is available in stereo, along with lots of other goodies, on the bootleg album R.S.V.P. on Cool Bloke Records. If you get your copy of Beggar's Banquet used, make sure it comes with the bonus fold-out poster - another thoughtful addition that makes the CD Maximum version the one to own over the remastered Abko release. Heck, furnish your whole Stones library with the CD Maximum releases while you're at it!
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Very powerful movie, beautifully evoking a life-changing love affair through the eyes of a young man, and its aftermath as he matures. The scenes set in 1950's Germany made it come alive. The story has multiple shades of grey and is wonderfully acted by Kate Winslet, David Kross, and Ralph Fiennes. Very emotionally and intellectually stimulating. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days.

No other guitar player has had such an impact on the history of music.
0930289234|4.0|Before reading Watchmen, I had never read a graphic novel, but I heard so many great things about this series.  I have to say, I absolutely loved this book!  The characters are so rich and enticing to follow, the author and illustrator pull you into the book.  They dare you to make inferences on the plot and then completely directs you into a different place you weren't expecting.<br /><br />My only problem with Watchmen is the ending, I wasn't too thrilled how everything concluded.  Maybe I was just disappointed that the book was over, but the ending really came out of nowhere and didn't really make sense with the rest of the book.<br /><br />A better ending and I would have given this five stars.  The illustration is top-notch and the author did an amazing job capturing an alternate world in 1985, bringing the characters to such a rich, fulfilling lives.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to break into the graphic novel medium and to anyone who enjoys a great superhero story.

1572816295|5.0|Paulina Cassidy was born and raised in Ontario, Canada and has been very interested in fairies for most of her life. These cards are a task she set herself and are very beautiful, delicate and unique.     This is a delicate and romantic seventy-eight tarot deck with instruction book (LWB). The cards are packed with detail and every time you re-visit them you espy something new. It is charming, has a Victorian flair with a pinch of a gothic Mardi Gras for good measure. The deck contains much of the Rider-Waite-Smith symbolism. The artwork is in watercolour and is done in soft, muted shades and I like her use of colour and visual interest by using animals, birds and fish along with the fae.     I always feel I should be using a lace table cloth when I get out this deck as I have a feeling of stepping back into a time of whimsy and magic. It takes you to a place where Dragons and Pegasus fly and many other magical creatures live side by side, interacting with humans. She also liberally uses birds, butterflies, dragonflies, all in magical forest and woodland settings.     The deck is printed on a high quality cardstock and measure 4 '\\" tall x 2 '\\" wide, with a very narrow, white border. The backs are done in soft shades of beige and grey featuring beautiful birds in flight. They are reversible. The cards have the card number and title on the bottom of each. Strength is numbered 8 and Justice 11. The suits are standard: Wands, Cups, Swords and Pentacles.     The LWB contains forty-seven pages. The Majors are listed first and the Minors follow in suit order. There is a description for each card, as well as, traditional meanings for upright and reverse draws. There is a brief segment discussing the Art of Divination. The LWB also includes the traditional Celtic Cross Spread and two blank pages to write notes.     This deck would be a nice tool for beginners as well as for the professional readers, however, some of the imagery is not strictly Rider Waite. For example Judgement is not three people in coffins with an angel blowing a trumpet but a person suspended happily in nature, cocooned in a tree of white light, whilst still joined by a golden thread/root to the earth. I really adore this deck and the imagery in this deck and I would highly recommend to anyone who is happy with \\"busy\\" illustrations and wants something very original. There is a definite feel of light and dark in some of the cards and an intricate organic theme to most of the illustrations; almost as though the designs grew and evloved onto the paper. From sunlit fields with flowers and rabbits to a foggy cemetery every card is delightful and inspirational.     I feel this deck would be suitable for all ages unless you had a highly sensitive person who may not like the slight gothic tone to it. It is for this type of sensibility I use the Gummi Bear tarot.     The service from Amazon was extremely good I received the cards promptly and in perfect condition.       Paulina now lives in Chattanooga, Tennessee with her husband. She has a website and it still working on new decks. If your like her artwork some of the orginal drawings are for sale. She also does the Pixie Kins calendar.     I hope you enjoy :)
B001PPGAIA|3.0|OK, it's not too painful to spend two and a half hours looking at Hugh Jackman and the little boy who played Nullah.   I got teary at the points where the director was clearly trying to jerk tears, and it is a gorgeous travelogue for Australia.   Yet the plot has holes you could drive one of those Army trucks through and the characters were pretty superficial.   In 2.5 hours you'd think a little time could be devoted to character development, but instead it was spent on special effects for a cattle stampede near a cliff.     How is it that Lady Sarah is trilling in that really annoying high-pitched squeal over kangaroos one minute (god was that irritating) yet herding cattle shortly thereafter?    Nor is there any reason for her to get so attached to Nullah except that he's so darn cute.  Just not very believeable.   Watch this one when you want some eye candy without a lot of thinking involved.

B001N18HO6|5.0|When you get the 8lb box containing PJ first release, Ten, it can be a bit like diving into the presents under the tree at Christmas time. Striping away layer after layer reveals how much though PJ put into this (look for similar VS and Vitology sets in the next two years, btw) and it's also a monument to E.V.'s love of vinyl and hand written scrawl to fans.<br /><br />But, what seems like so much at first, becomes a little tedious later, and may leave you wondering a few things about how so much got in, yet so much more could have been in.<br /><br />The box contains 2 CD's, Ten Remastered (the original mix newly transferred from analog to digital, re-equalized and leveled) and Ten Re-Mixed, the point of the whole thing. The re-mix was requested by the band to long-time producer Brendon O'Brian before VS was even released, the band was never happy with the reverb heavy, wall 'o sound pop feel of the first mix (as you may have noticed in how different VS sounds.) To an extent O'Brian succeeds in fixing this, but the CD is unreasonably compressed (meaning the mid-level is raised so that there is little to no difference volume wise to any parts of the songs, the softest, quietest moments are as loud as the most rocking ones) and songs like Evenflow and Black still sound too busy and nothing like thier live versions from the same era.<br /><br />What O'brian did do was strip much of the reverb, especially from the vocals, the guitars are now sharper, the bass clearer and the over-all sound cleaner and more detailed.

B001MW0IY8|5.0|Antony and the Johnsons do not make meat and potatoes rock and roll. If Bruce Springsteen is as experimental as you get, this is not the disc for you. My suspicion is that if you made it past the cover art to actually read this review, you are the type of person whose tastes are a little more adventurous. I don't know anything about the singer or the people in the band. Their personal histories and their life styles and habits don't interest me. What does interest me is good music. Antony's tremulous falsetto is a little challenging, perhaps an acquired taste. That is not to say it is not beautiful. It is. But you have to listen. I am old enough to remember Tiny Tim. I would not be honest if I did not say that hearing Antony's voice made me think of him at first. However, while Tiny Tim's voice was only silly as far as I could tell, Antony's is sweet and vulnerable. And serious. Dramatic, at times. He never teeters over the edge into preciousness, as far as I am concerned. The lyrics are poetic and evocative, not linear and obvious. Antony writes and sings in a way that commands attention, that draws you in and makes you want to listen closer. The music itself is richly textured and interesting.    The song that is worth the price of the cd to me is \\"Another World.\\" It is haunting. I haven't been so affected by a song since Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren.\\" And, more than anyone, Antony reminds me of that artist. I have listened to Another World over and over. Why not just download that one song instead of purchasing the whole recording? The rest of it is nearly as good; it builds a mood. And one song from Antony and the Johnsons just isn't enough.

0765350386|5.0|After reading Elantris, it was easy to see that Sanderson is an author to be reckoned with. Mistborn only further supported that notion. After reading these books, by girlfriend told me that I absolutely had to read them and they were some of her favorites to date. Now usually when something is really hyped up to me, it tends to fall short after I experience it. This was not so with this trilogy. The world that is created in Mistborn is given the kind of attention and thought that Tolkien gave his world (not quite as deep and detailed, but on its way). I felt such an attachment to Vin and Kelsier, it was hard to imagine that there were only three books in this series. I felt like just as much happened in these three books than a few 10 book series that are out there, an without missing any of the rich detail that has become a staple of the fantasy genre.  Elements such as the presence that Kelsier has throughout all three books is what keeps me in awe even after I have finished reading. These characters do not even exist, yet I feel like I would jump right into the crew and lay down my life for all those involved. Spectacular stories, and each as good as the next. As a reader you will never begin to expect the directions that Sanderson takes you.  What a journey! A must read.

B00026W82U|5.0|Riot on an Empty Street by Kings of Convenience is one of those albums that hauntingly seep into your consciousness with simple melodies, deep lyrics and killer transitions. And before you know it, you're asleep. Not because it's a bad CD. On the contrary, it's a great album where songs like Misread captures your attention in the first few notes and takes you away into a sweet harmony of instruments (guitar, piano, etc...) and vocal melodies that is as fresh as a newly picked Zucchini from Alice Water's backyard garden. Also love the I'd Rather Dance with You than Talk with You single--almost a cross between Al Stewart and Damien Rice (after taking a happy pill).      Overall, I love it! You can take Riot on an Empty Street going to and coming from Las Vegas--either way, you feel like a winner, without the guilt.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|With a screenplay by the acclaimed Andrew Davies [who also wrote the screenplays for \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Bleak House\\" etc], Charles Dickens' \\"Little Dorrit\\" comes alive onscreen as shown on PBS. This particular adaptation is very faithful to the original work, perhaps overly so, yet the incredible cast makes this production top-quality period drama.<br /><br />Typical of Dickens' work, there is much focus on the differences between the upper and lower strata in society. Matthew MacFadyen plays Arthur Clennam, who returns from abroad to find his emotionally-detached mother [played by Judy Parfitt] employing an impoverished young woman, Amy \\"Little\\" Dorrit [ an almost luminescent Claire Foy] who was basically born and bred in debtor's prison where her father William [Tom Courtenay]has been incarcerated for more than two decades. She goes back to tend to his needs on the weekends. Arthur begins to fear that his mother is concealing some dark secrets and that his family may be involved in bringing about the Dorrits' downfall, and the well-intentioned young man goes about remedying the situation. The kind-hearted  Amy falls for Arthur but the path of true love doesn't run very smoothly here, and it takes some convoluted plot twists.<br /><br />On the whole, the casting was well-done but I did find the actress playing Tattycoram to be more annoying than convincing in her performance. I also thought that the scenes with Ms Wade [Maxine Peake] were overly-dramatized. Though this production stays very faithful to the book, it could have done with some editing, as the story itself is laborious and can be quite daunting to a viewer unfamiliar with the book, noting the complex cast of characters and their relationship to one another.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this production of \\"Little Dorrit\\" to fans of British period dramas, and especially to those who love Dickens' work. It would perhaps be prudent to read the book before watching this drama if only to refresh one's memory of the intricate storyline, especially considering that the last hour of the production seems like a rushed attempt to iron out the plot towards its conclusion.intricate storyline, especially considering that the last hour of the production seems like a rushed attempt to iron out the plot towards its conclusion.

B000FGGE5Y|2.0|Ultraviolet / B000FGGE5Y<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />Oh, I really wanted to like Ultraviolet. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, just some decent action and a nifty dystopia, something along the lines of Aeon Flux, Equilibrium, and (of course) The Matrix.<br /><br />Ultraviolet starts off with a bang. Milla is a superb action heroine, as always, and she dazzles with a wonderful combination of high-tech gadgetry (she's got an anti-gravity device!), high-speed chases, and high-skill martial arts. Combo in an intriguing (if a bit long and draggy) voice-over involving vampires, and Milla's mysteriously changing hair color, and this should be a perfect mindless Friday night flick.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the action slows to a crawl after the first twenty minutes (as do the cool hair color changes - it will remain disappointingly black for the rest of the movie, despite all the cool changes you saw in the previews), and you won't get to see too many more fancy moves until the final race to the finish. The filler dialogue is teeth-grindingly bad, with Milla having approximately eighteen earnest heart-to-hearts with the Capture/Rescue Kid. Some of these heart-to-hearts occur back to back and while enemy soldiers are closing in, and the resulting overexposure of Milla's tender side (which the savvy user grasped in the initial opening voice over, for crying out loud) feels like a hammer to the temples. She's a vampire! She's dying! She's saddened by the loss of her pregnancy! She's bonding with the child! Yeah, we got it.<br /><br />Really, this would have been a much better film if the writers had trusted the audience to get it and just cut 90% of the filler dialogue and just left us 'silent scenes' instead of Milla dragging her reluctant charge around this world gone mad. Although I love mindless action films, I simply can't bear to sit through Ultraviolet again, so I'm selling my copy and hoping the next Milla film will have better writing that she deserves.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

B00000K31Q|4.0|10 Things I Hate About You / B00000K31Q<br /><br />*Spoiler*<br /><br />Loosely based on Shakespeare's \\"Taming of the Shrew\\", \\"10 Things\\" is a very decent modern adaptation of this sometimes troublesome old tale. Faced with concepts that are difficult to translate to modern audiences, for instance why the desirable Bianca is off-limits until her abrasive sister Kat dates/marries in a world that no longer has bride prices and dowries, the film writers have created the clever conceit of a father obsessed with preventing his daughters from becoming grown, sexual beings. Tired of having the same argument with his social butterfly daughter Bianca, he childishly transfers the burden of parent onto the older Kat, saying that Bianca can date only when Kat does and trusting that Kat will continue to remain solitary and cloistered within the home.<br /><br />Neatly dodging questions of potential sexism in the original material, the abrasive Kat has been rendered as a superbly sympathetic character. From the beginning, it is clear that her tough exterior is not simply a factor of her being a terrible person, but rather it is a form of self-defense in the cruel world of high school politics. She is willing to open up to genuine kindness, but she refuses to be manipulated or used, and hopes to impart this wisdom somehow to her more vulnerable sister.<br /><br />Impressively, almost every character grows and learns something in this film. Kat and Patrick learn the value of trust and vulnerability in a relationship; Bianca and Cameron learn to judge when and how to be healthily selfish; and \\"Dad\\" learns to stop trying to prevent his daughters from growing up and to instead support them in such a way that he can still advise and guide them as they grow.<br /><br />Although this is a very good adaptation, it is arguable how 'timeless' \\"10 Things\\" is. High school is a naturally constraining setting, and high school rom-coms tend to age rather badly. Parents will want to note that this movie contains potentially objectionable language and situations involving alcohol and suggestive dancing. This version also contains captions for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollle language and situations involving alcohol and suggestive dancing.

B001R0KH3M|5.0|I've been a fan since fingertips. And I have to say how can you not love I mean absolutey love Stevie Wonder. I saw this concert when it came to Mountain View,California last summer. He had everyone singing along with him and dancing in their seats to his many, many hits. This dvd captures that and much, much more. I defy you to buy this dvd and not find yourself dancing and singing along to the music. At 12 years old he was considered a musical genius that was just the tip of the iceberg. He's still going strong and I see no end in sight. This dvd is a real bargan as a matter of fact I would say it's the deal  of the century and if you're a fan like I am you better snatch it up before it disappears

B001G9F9IW|4.0|The movie Vicky Cristina Barcelona, produced in 2008 and starring Rebecca Hall as Vicky, Scarlett Johansson as Cristina, Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio and Penelope Cruz as Maria Elena, is a story about two good friends, Vicky and Cristina, and their summer getaway to Spain. Once in Spain the two girls meet Juan Antonio, a sort of Spanish Casanova with very liberal views on love and relationships. Both girls get involved with Juan Antonio and eventually with Maria Elena, his somewhat crazy ex-wife. Vicky has one night of passion with Juan Antonio and develops feelings for him but is torn between him and the commitment to her fiancée whom she eventually marries in Barcelona. Juan Antonio then starts a relationship with Cristina which leads to great chemistry, since they share a passion for life, art, and similar views on love. Then, Maria Elena comes to live with Juan Antonio and Cristina after she overdosed on pills and that starts a strange three-way relationship between Cristina, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena. Everything seems well until Cristina realizes this is not what she wants and decides to return to America with Vicky, who has settled to remain with her new husband rather than follow through with her feelings for Juan Antonio. Both Vicky and Cristina return to America feeling the same way they had at the beginning of the movie.    Vicky is presented at the beginning of the movie as a girl that knows what she wants.  She knows what she wants, plans for it, and gets it.  She like stability and predictability. In love, Vicky values much the same things like stability, commitment and even predictability to some extent. She is very sensible even though sh pretends to not be the type to get carried away with the right romantic setting. Cristina likes many of the same things Vicky does we are told at the beginning of the movie but leads a completely different lifestyle. Cristina likes spontaneity and avoids predictability at all costs. She is not sure what she wants out of life and tries her hand at many artistic pursuits in search of her niche. I love she is only sure of what she does not want: Vicky's love life. Cristina seems to expect any truly passionate and worthwhile romance to inevitably lead to pain and so seem s to prefer these types of risky romances.    Throughout the movie, the two girls seem to serve as each others balancing opposite. Vicky is the voice of reason that Cristina needs to hear from time to time and Cristina adds a little excitement to Vicky's rather predictable life. It is strange to see just how well these to characters get along together being so fundamentally different and this may be the reason that they work so well together. They understand each other, perhaps, because each one is what the other wishes they were like. Towards the end Vicky almost takes that risk to go with Juan Antonio, as Cristina would have done, which shows that despite her better knowledge she was willing to take the risk. In the end reality sinks in to both girls and they return to their normal lives. Vicky playing it safe and Cristina still only sure of what she did not want.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|This is my first opera-on-DVD purchase but I took my time reading reviews of this and other renditions of this opera before buying it. It is a true and faithful production of Mozart's opera in that it is in the original German, none of the pieces have been omitted, shortened or mangled and that the set design reflects the original setting. Based on reviews I have read, other versions of this opera are modified, edited and rearranged (as is so often the case) to suit someone else's artistic intent. It gives me great joy to find an opera so faithfully done. I highly recommend this to anyone in search of a good opera.
0786948523|5.0|You know what is great about the 4E rules for D&D? They made it easy, and fun, for NEW PLAYERS to get into the game. They simplified and streamlined a lot of the nit-picky stuff (which, granted, some people love), and made it easier to just jump into the game.<br /><br />What this means is that I can start an impromptu game with my little sisters, and actually keep and HOLD their attention all the way through an entire gaming session of about 2 hours. That is AMAZING! They have always liked the game, and the fun of the dice rolls, etc. What they DIDN'T like, was dying (or being knocked unconscious), limited spell use, confusing power rules, and almost no low level party members being able to to HEAL!<br /><br />With 4E, EVERYONE can heal with the new \\"healing surge\\" abilities. I don't know about anyone else, but my parties generally ALWAYS suffered from healing problems in their lower levels. Either because nobody was playing a cleric, or there weren't enough healing potions to go around. Mages/wizards can now cast spells whenever they please (only being able to cast magic missile once per day/rest cycle is a real bummer to a little girl who wants to play a magic casting bad-arse as her character!), and all of the powers quickly and easily divided up into \\"at will,\\" \\"once per encounter,\\" and, \\"daily\\" powers. Given the almost unlimited choices available in 3E and 3.5E, they would get confused, overwhelmed, and stop wanting to play. Most little girls do not want to sit down and do homework to \\"play.\\"<br /><br />I am a 3E and 3.5E rule set owning DM, and I am here to say that 4E is not for everyone! But, if you are like me, and are trying to get new people into D&D, give 4E a try. I am fairly certain you will enjoy running a game for those people using 4E rules. I am switching over entirely to 4E for all new games I will be running hereafter. I will be hanging on to my 3E and 3.5E books, but those will be used for campaigns for D&D veterans. ;-)<br /><br />Enjoy!

Every page has valuable information- this book is all killer, no filler, with the foundation being one's will to live instead of a bunch of pricey survival items. I still can't believe all the information it has at the bargain amazon price! It shows you how to build an igloo and other forms of shelter, deliver a baby, skin your next meal- EVERYTHING. Needless to say, there's a reason why the previous editions of this book has sold over a million copies.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Brought this a few days ago and am really impressed. Every song is a winner and I think this is better than his last. The songs are well written and represent typical Keith Urban. My favorite song is \\"Standing Right In Front Of You\\" should be a huge hit. The song can be listened to over and over again. Lots of energenic songs.   I'm glad Keith keeps what works. Too many artists try new stuff and it doesn't work. This is definately one of his best albums. Only 11 songs but every one is winner. Rolling Stone only gives this album 2 stars. They say he plays it safe. Rolling Stone magazine has rolled downhill for several years. I'm assuming they are doing poorly since their circulation is way down. They need some talented people there who can really rate and review.
B000UR9T82|5.0|This really doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the movies.  I happened to enjoy all three as being above average super-movies.

The colors are so intense at times that they actually hurt your eyes if you're sitting too close to your 50\\" HD TV.  Blu-Ray is a differnce that is easily noticable and worth the extra bucks for those movies that flash color, scenery, mind-boggling special effects and grandeur.

Jill Bolte Taylor's book also helps to be more sensitive and compassionate to others who have brain disorders or injury.

B000MV8AE0|2.0|This just happened to be on cable last night. I knew not to compare it to the love story \\"Immortal Beloved\\" (which I happened to like very much) but I never dreamed that it would openly plagiarise \\"Amadeus\\". Wasn't Beethoven interesting enough on his own? It was truly disappointed with the \\"deathbed\\" scene (okay, he wasn't dying, but you get the idea)... the way he called out the notes, asked Anna if \\"she got it\\", moved his hands while humming, etc., it was so tragically copycat of Mozart dictating the Requiem to Salieri that I couldn't bear to watch.    Now I did give this 3 stars for 3 reasons: I liked having a little more background on Beethoven's nephew; I loved the Salieri and Orsini name-dropping; but most of all, having never heard anything of the 9th symphony except the chorale \\"Ode to Joy\\", I was enthralled with the entire scene... the faces of the audience in awe and the look on his face when Anna turns him to face the throng (which I was mentally combining with same scene from \\"Immortal\\").

B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I only saw this movie because my boss told me that I was like John Nash ( I was a research chemist) and now retired. I have an IQ which fluctuate from idiot to genius and can solve problems no one else have been able to solve. I have an overactive imagination as well. My opinion of mathematicians is they sometimes confuse mathematics with reality. A mathematical equation is not reality like many mathematicians think it is. Its easy to get trapped into thinking it is. I am a conspiracy nut and sometimes read people wrong. It is because I really was drugged and brainwashed by the government for knowing things I was not suppose to know. My former wife accused me of being schizophrenic and wanted me to get help. I think this movie is part of a conspiracy to cover up the fact people really are drugged and experimented on by the government and the government wants the public to think these people who claimed to have been experimented on with mind control are actually suffering from various brain disorders. But when they really are out to silence you it makes you paranoid. This movie was very informative. I had no idea so many respected Ivy league colleges and Universities were  involved in the type of work portrayed in the move.
0470185317|5.0|Great book - It states teaching VHDL is not its goal; the goal is FPGA programming in a general way to be transportable across various FPGAs while apologizing for the need to use a specific hardware board for the examples. The board is the Xilinx Spartan-3 evaluation board which is readily available for ~$200.  It starts with an easy logic structure and ends with a complex pico-Blaze soft-core embedded processor project. It has memory controllers, LCD and PS/2 keyboard controllers in between.  Each example has the full VHDL code and many compare alternate HDL coding approaches. Thus, while VHDL syntax is not covered directly, if you want the construct of a multiplexer or a serial port, or more complex functions, the examples serve as an excellent starting point and will continue to provide solid building blocks for future projects.  If you are having difficulty sorting out the starting point in the fog of VHDL, ISE tools, RTL, footprints, and all else related to FPGAs using this book in conjunction with the Xilinx Spartan-3 evaluation board will point you in the right direction. Within a matter of a few days to a couple of weeks you will understand the key elements, the order they are applied and be able to demonstrate them in actual hardware. To become an expert is a long path, finding the trail head is always a good start.  Once you are comfortable with the FPGA coding process \\"Circuit Design with VHDL\\" by Volnei A. Pedroni is an excellent reference book on VHDL for future projects.
0316168815|5.0|A unique and stunning work, yet \\"unspectacular\\" in the best sense.

The vision of heaven as individual and changing is fascinating and well done. Terrific writing on every level. Mesmerizing and profound and a pleasure to read. It's the first book by Sebold I've read; can't wait to try another.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|Thank You Paul... This is such a joy to listen to. Each listen reveals new pleasures. Since about 1963, I've never missed a musical trip from you and your brothers. Beatles and all the solo music bar none. Electric Arguments ranks right up with my favorites. I believe John would dig this CD completely! It rocks it rolls and it grooves - Thank You!
0517548232|1.0|It is astounding that anyone in this age can seriously recommend this book.  It has no bearing on the world economy and is blatantly anti labor and anti government regulation. It is hopelessly out of date.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I have already listened the this entire album several times and absolutely love it from beginning to end.  It is uplifting, happy, and sophisticated.  The message of being open to love is something that we all need to hear at certain times in our lives.   I would list a couple of my favorite songs, but I tried that and found myself listing all of the songs.  The \\"journey\\" that the music takes you on is an element of this album not to be missed.  Keith definitely gets better with each new album; although, I love all of his music.  This is feel good music done with class and intelligence.  A must have not matter what music you like!
B001QMCJ1Y|4.0|Before \\"Winged Migration\\", there was \\"Fly Away Home\\".  A 1996 film which was loosely based on the 1995 autobiography \\"Father Goose\\" by Bill Lishman.<br /><br />The film received positive reviews from many critics and audiences as the film would showcase a heartwarming tale primarily about family but something different was that this became the first Hollywood film to show the latest efforts in  migration for birds and also introducing audiences to the concept of \\"imprinting\\".  In other words, humans forming a bond with birds, geese when they are born and then raising them somewhat as a parent and then teaching them how to migrate and eventually increase their population away from harm.<br /><br />Taking on the directorial role for \\"Fly Away Home\\" is Carroll Ballard, known for his work with films such as \\"The Black Stallion\\" and \\"Never Cry Wolf\\" joins writing team Robert Rodat (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"The Patriot\\") along with Vince McKewin (television writer for many series such as \\"The A-Team\\", \\"Knight Rider\\", \\"Dallas\\").  Carroll Ballard known for his previous films that involve animals was back to directing a touching film about family, overcoming challenges and sticking together.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Fly Away Home\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition and with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1.  As with most film created in the early-t0-mid-90's for Blu-ray releases, there is this softening effect that many tend to suffer from.  With \\"Fly Away Home\\", one of the positive aspects of the picture quality is that the film is shot outdoors and thus, you get a sense of the beauty of nature with the lush green and red trees during the fall, the green scenery while the aircraft is in flight.  Also, being in the air while the geese are flying.  Very good outdoor shots and vibrant colors.<br /><br />There is little softening effect during the indoor scenes but overall, picture quality is beautiful during the outdoors and many of the shots of the film are outdoors.<br /><br />As for audio, audio is presented in English and French via Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Spanish 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily dialogue-based as the film is about conversations between father and daughter and daughter with family members.  But one of the biggest showcase for \\"Fly Away Home\\" is the music from Mark Isham.  Definitely creating a mood and the feeling of flight and beauty.  Definitely well-incorporated to the Blu-ray and sounds great.<br /><br />There is also good use of surround audio with the noise of the geese but overall the film is primarily a dialogue-driven film and the sound is quite clear coming from the front and center channels.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />For the special features included on the Blu-ray for \\"Fly Away Home\\", the features are in standard definition with English (stereo) audio with optional Spanish subtitles.  Features included on the Blu-ray disc are:<br /><br />  * Director & Cinematographer Commentary - Commentary track by Carroll Ballard and Caleb Deschanel as they talked about the filming of the geese in flight.  Definitely a complicated film to shoot and finding the various locations to shoot the film and the ultra gliders was a challenge.  A very good commentary for those interested in learning how everything came together for the film.<br />  * Operation Migration: Birds of a Feather Featurette - An 18-minute about Operation Migration.  A company founded by Bill Lishman and Joe Duff in 1994, a non-profit charity organization and how they are migrating rare and endangered species in order to grow the population.  The featurette introduces the various staff members and also, unlike the film and other countries which the birds are introduced to humans, the organization now wears costumes, so the birds will not think they are human.  Very informative.<br />  * The Ultra Geese Documentary - A 49-minute documentary which the film \\"Fly Away Home\\" is based on.  The documentary features Bill Lishmanand Joe Duff testing to see if they can treat geese new migration routes through the use of their ultralight aircraft.  Their goal is to restore the population of birds through new migration routes and showing us what actually really happened in their experience vs. what actually happened on the film.  The experiences that Lishman and Duff faced such as imprinting, the use of the ultralight aircraft,  having 18 birds with its leader Igor and losing Igor, having to contend with the Wildlife Bureaucratic Service and  more.  Very entertaining as Lishman and crew actually had a lot of footage of training the geese to flying with the geese and more.<br />  * HBO Making of: Leading the Flock Featurette - This 13-minute featurette showcases interviews with the director and the many talent involved in the film.  Especially how everyone were quite impressed with Anna Paquin's performance in the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is also BD-Live enabled.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Fly Away Home\\" was definitely an enjoyable, heartfelt family film that touches upon the real life activity of Operation Migration and what they are doing to help restore endangered species of birds and helping them migrate.  But what was even more remarkable was watching the cinematography of showing birds in flight and being so close to them.  Granted, bird cinematography has since evolved since this 1996 film with the 2003 release of \\"Winged Migration\\" and also \\"Planet Earth\\" but considering the challenge of filming this scene, Director of Photography Caleb Deschanel successfully pulled it off.  If anything, the nomination for \\"Best Cinematography\\" was definitely warranted.<br /><br />As for Carroll Ballard,  his name is  known for hits such as the 1979 film \\"The Black Stallion\\" and 1983 film \\"Never Cry Wolf\\", films that deal with animals (which he followed up with his 2005 film \\"Duma\\" about an orphaned cheetah) and sure enough, a good director to take on the challenge for \\"Fly Away Home\\" and trying to create this bond between a young character with an animal, in this case, geese.<br /><br />For younger talent, \\"Fly Away Home\\" definitely was a film that showcased Anna Paquin's talent as an actress.  Having won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the age of 11 (for the 1994 film \\"The Piano\\"), Paquin definitely brought a character with a lot of layers.  A character having to deal with this new life, this father who she has never seen for years and then ultimately finding common ground thanks to her geese.<br /><br />Jeff Daniels does a great job portraying Thomas, this inventor/naturalist with his shaggy beard and long hair but doing a great job of portraying a father who is not too sure if he can take care of his daughter.  Credit to the writers who portrayed this family who really had nothing in common at first but eventually finding the common ground and eventually bonding through Thomas' love for flying and Amy's love for her geese and eventually, her becoming a pilot and sharing her father's enthusiasm.<br /><br />The film also stars Dana Delany.  Over a decade before her role currently in the TV series \\"Desperate Housewives\\", Delany was definitely known for her Emmy award winning work in the critically acclaimed Vietnam War television show \\"China Beach\\" during the late 80's and early 90's and a lot of her voice work for the Batman and Superman animated series.<br /><br />Some may feel that Delany was under utilized in \\"Far Away Home\\" but nevertheless, despite a short role, an important role of portraying the girlfriend of Thomas and for her character as Susan trying to get close to his daughter Amy (Paquin).<br /><br />If anything, the supporting actor who did shine in this film and definitely caught my attention was Terry Kinney as Thomas's brother David who brings a certain humor into the film as the uncle who is laid back but eventually comes up with major ideas to help the Thomas and Amy but most importantly, the geese.<br /><br />\\"Fly Away Home\\" is a film that manages to hold up nearly 13 years later as a family film.  On Blu-ray, for those interested in migration of birds will love that the Blu-ray does features two featurettes and one lengthy documentary on the actual story that the film is based on.<br /><br />Especially knowing that certain things that happened in the film, happened in real life.  For Bill Lishman who co-founded Operation Migration (and in real life was the man piloting the ultralight aircraft with the geese), the leader of the pack for his geese was Oscar and similar to the film, Oscar was separated from the pack and was lost but eventually found.  But unlike the film where Oscar has a prominent part of being there with Amy during the flight, in real life, Oscar's return back to the pack of Geese was not an exactly enthusiastic return as the geese that he once lead turned against him.  So, it was an interesting segment in the special feature showing the relationships of the geese.<br /><br />So, my highlight was the documentary and also the informative special features included in this Blu-ray disc release and for those who enjoyed the 2003 film \\"Winged Migration\\", \\"Fly Away Home\\" was a film that definitely introduced many people to imprinting and new migration techniques.  In fact, \\"Winged Migration\\" on Blu-ray is being releaased on the same day as \\"Fly Away Home\\" and Bill Lishman had some involvement with that film as well.<br /><br />If I had any problems with the special features on the Blu-ray disc is that it doesn't include the isolated 5.1 Music Score with Composer Mark Isham's commentary which was included in the original 2003 DVD.  The music was an important part of the film and I felt the DVD showing a tribute to Isham's music was awesome.  But I was surprised it was omitted on the Blu-ray release.  But regardless of the special feature not included, for Blu-ray fans, it's all about the picture and audio quality and \\"Fly Away Home\\" looks and sounds so much better via high definition that the Blu-ray version is the definitive version to own.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Fly Away Home\\" is a touching, moving and enjoyable film about family and overcoming challenges.  And the film manages to accomplish portraying the family bond between estranged father and daughter but also showcasing beautiful cinematography that really makes this family film worth watching.\\"Fly Away Home\\" definitely was a film that showcased Anna Paquin's talent as an actress.

B0012E2HRC|2.0|Two amazing actors but not particularly believable together in a romance. A slow plot that doesn't gather much momentum. I couldn't imagine their relationship working anyway (seemed much more like an unrealistic fling on both parts) and so couldn't really get into the romance, which is the basis of the film. And this is coming from a totally sentimental, cry out a box of Kleenex gal. And what was to stop her from adding a little spice to her own marriage? Her husband wasn't an entirely unlikeable guy. When he asked her why she was crying in the end, that was a chance to offer up something to him. Overall unrealistic, which dampened any attempt to get into the movie and characters. And the \\"Italian\\" accent seemed more Eastern European.
B001FB55N0|4.0|A child-friendly Adam Sandler film!  An enjoyable family film with a good dose of fantasy and action balancing both Walt Disney innocence and Happy Madison craziness.<br /><br />The film is directed by Adam Shankman (\\"Hairspray\\", \\"The Wedding Planner\\", \\"Bringing Down the House\\" and a screenplay by Matt Lopez (\\"Race to Witch Mountain\\") and Saturday Night Live writer Tim Herlihy (\\"The Wedding Singer\\", \\"Happy Gilmore\\", \\"Little Nicky\\" and \\"Big Daddy\\")<br /><br />\\"Bedtime Stories\\" is a film that kicks off a flashback from the past, taking place at a family run inn.  Father Marty Bronson (Jonathan Pryce) raising his two children (also employees of the Inn) trying to keep his business and family afloat.  Every night reading his children a bedtime story, Bronson tries to keep a happy face despite knowing his inn is not doing well financially.  Businessman and hotel mogul Barry Nottingham offers Marty plenty of money if he signs away the rights to the inn and Marty agrees to the deal if only he makes a promise that when his son Skeeter becomes older, he would run the inn.  The two make a deal.<br /><br />Flash forward to the present, nearly twenty five years later and the inn has now become among one of Nottingham's multi-million dollar hotel investments and is now a popular, classy and luxurious hotel in Southern California.  Meanwhile, Skeeter Bronson (Adam Sandler), a middle-aged man handyman/custodian is not exactly running the business as his father has hoped.<br /><br />When Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) makes an announcement of a new hotel to open up in Southern California, Skeeter feels that perhaps this is his time.  Unfortunately, the job is given to the arrogant Kendall (Guy Pearce).  A man who is dating Nottingham hotel heiress Violet Nottingham (Teresa Palmer), a party hopping, Paris Hilton-esque socialite and behind-the-scenes, Kendall is having fun with the hotel concierge Aspen (Lucy Lawless).<br /><br />Feeling that he's down on his luck, Skeeter goes to visit his sister Wendy (Courteney Cox) and his niece Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and nephew Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit) who is celebrating a birthday.  But all is not good with the family.  Wendy's husband has left the family and she lost her job as a principal of her school due to the school closing.  She has an interview for a job in another state but she needs someone to watch the kids for a few days.  So, she asks if Skeeter can watch the kids at night, while during the day, her friend and a teacher at the school, Jill (Keri Russell), who has the children during the day.  Unfortunately, Skeeter and Jill are at opposite ends of the spectrum and don't get along.<br /><br />But Skeeter, who is not really close to the kids (nor do they know each other very well) agrees to take care of them for a few days.  Also, joining them is their guinea pig (with its big eyes) named Bubsy.<br /><br />Both Bobbia and Patrick have been raised by their mother to eat healthy, no television but Skeeter feels they need to have some fun.  So, he lets them watch television, eat burgers and reads them a bedtime story.  But Skeeter is not exactly in the happiest moods due to his job situation, so each time he tells a story, he ends it with a bad ending.  So, the first bedtime story features a peasant named Sir Fix-a-Lot (Sandler) who is a hardworking man who is bypassed from a job which goes to Sir Butkiss (Pearce), a story that mirrors Skeeter's own life. But the children insist that a story must have a happy ending, so they start adding to the storyline of how things workout for Sir Fix-a-Lot such as his boss giving him a chance to prove that he's worthy of taking over the business and gumballs start raining in on him.  Then after the kids finish the story, a sound of chimes appear.  When Skeeter asks what that sound was, the kids tell him that it's their guinea pig ringing the chimes and wanting to go to sleep.<br /><br />The day after, certain things that were told in the bedtime storycomes true.  After bad decision making by Kendall, Mr. Nottingham decides that he will give Skeeter a chance of taking over the new hotel.  But it all comes down to who can come up with the best plan for the new hotel.  Skeeter or Kendall.  But for Skeeter, he feels something may be magical with the bedtime story when gumballs raining on top of him (actually a gumball truck was hit in an accident and thus the balls are falling off the interstate on to his car).<br /><br />Feeling that the kids and even Bubsy may have something magical, he feels that perhaps he can help them come up with a great bedtime story that would benefit him in real life.  So, with the last remaining three days with the children before he returns him to his mother, Skeeter comes up with ideas for him to get a Ferrari, a kiss from a damsel in distress and more!  But of course, with the children's imaginative minds, things don't work out as smooth as Skeeter is hoping for things to be.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has been on top of their Blu-ray game.  Becoming one of the few companies to release their Blu-rays with a bonus DVD and digital copy all in one, the Blu-ray releases are also known for its magnificent picture and audio quality.<br /><br />So, with the release of \\"BEDTIME STORIES\\", the film is featured via 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:30:1.  Picture quality is vibrant and  looks absolutely beautiful.  One of the things that helps the film is much of it is filmed outdoors.  With beautiful shots by DP Michael Barrett, the film really captures colors with the gumballs to the red Ferrari (horse and car).  I didn't see any artifacting during the dark scenes and picture quality is just magnificent via High Definition on Blu-ray.  Also, another plus is that the film utilizes a good blend of real time shooting and CG (during the sci-fi action scenes).<br /><br />Another positive for the Blu-ray release is that the special features are featured in 1080p.<br /><br />As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48kHZ, 24-Bit) and again, one of the positive things about this film is that the bedtime story sequences are action-based.  And thus you get very good audio response from your front, center and rear channels.  Scenes such as \\"Gravity Wars\\" from the audience to the weapon usage to Skeeter's truck backfiring, really sounds good courtesy of the DTS-HD.  I noticed certain scenes really come quite strong from the rear surround channels during the action sequences.  Dialogue overall is heard quite clearly from your front and center channels.<br /><br />Also, included is a French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital track as well.<br /><br />Subtitles are provided in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />Special features included on the \\"Bedtime Stories\\" Blu-ray are:<br /><br />  * Until Gravity Do Us Part - A four minute behind-the-scenes look at the film's mindboggling special effects.  Interviews with John Adrew Berton Jr. (Visual Effects Supervisor) and Garrett Warren (Fight Choreographer) on how the segment was filmed.  Quite interesting how much was put into the making of this scene CG wise and also instead of green screen, using all blu-screen and how much went into the fight choreography and getting Sandler and Pearce ready for the role.<br />  * It's Bugsy - A near four minute featurette featuring a close up of Bugsy the big-eyed guinea pig.  Behind-the-scenes of how many guinea pigs were used in the film and how they were utilized.  Interviews with the cast of working with the guinea pig and more.<br />  * To All The Little People - A near six minute featurette featuring interviews with Laura Ann Kesling (Bobbi) and Jonathan Morgan Heit (Patrick) and how they felt about working with Director Adam Shankman, Adam Sandler, Russell Brand, Keri Russell, Courteney Cox and others.  Also, how the talent felt with working with the children.<br />  * Laughter is Contagious Outtakes - A seven minute featurette featuring outtakes and interviews with the cast of working with each other.  How Adam Sandler made everyone laugh and how he was good with the children.  How Rob Schneider would make Adam Sandler laugh and much more.<br />  * Cutting Room Flor: Deleted Scenes - Ten minutes worth of 12 deleted and extended scenes.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is also BD-Live enabled with movie chat, movie mail and Disney Movie Rewards Live.<br /><br />The included DVD features a special feature not included on the Blu-ray disc:<br /><br />  * Dylan & Cole Sprouse: Blu-ray is Suite - \\"The Suite Life of Zach & Cody\\" talents star in a six minute special feature promoting Blu-ray technology.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Bedtime Stories\\" for its combination of comedy, fantasy and adventure.  If anything,  it was a fun and enjoyable family film.<br /><br />Sure, I know it is a Happy Madison film (in collaboration with Walt Disney) but parents do not have to worry because none of the adult humor that you would come to expect from a Happy Madison film is there.  If anything, this film is a very fun and safe family film.  And if there was anything that may be deemed as risky, it ended up on the cutting room floor (which scenes you can watch in the deleted scenes special feature).<br /><br />If anything, I think fatherhood has brought out Adam Sandler's gentler side and I think this film is probably one of the rare film to see the side of a lighthearted Adam Sandler with children (you'll see it more evident on the special features as the children absolute adore him).  And for the primary two children of the film, both Laura Ann Kesling (Bobbi) and Jonathan Morgan Heit (Patrick) were just adorable and did a great job for their role in the film.<br /><br />But as much as I enjoyed the film, there were a few more things that were hits but yet a few that were misses.  One of the hits is featuring British comic Russel Brand.  His interaction with Sandler was fun as the sleep panicky, crazy friend.  And of course, what would a Adam Sandler Happy Madison film be without Rob Schneider in some crazy role and in this case, as Chief Runningmouth and the pickpocket thief.<br /><br />As for misses, it would have to be Lucy Lawless as Aspen.  As much as I enjoy watching the \\"Xena\\"/\\"Battlestar Galactica\\" actress, in the beginning, you get a feeling of the conspiring duo of Aspen and Kendall trying to gain power to run a hotel. So, you kind of get a feeling of a juicy conspiring role with her character and the protagonist Kendall but all of a sudden, she's lost in the second half of the film. If anything, what could have been a strong villain with the Aspen and Kendall duo in the film, suddenly gets degraded and the focus becomes more on family helping each other and the chemistry between Sandler's Skeeter and Russel's Jill.<br /><br />So, it was unfortunate that Lawless's character as Aspen didn't live up to its potential but at least she had a good appearance in the first half of the film, unlike Carmen Elektra who has only a non-speaking cameo as the girlfriend of a guy showing off his vehicle.<br /><br />Also, for some people who want an explanation of how these mysterious bedtime stories end up coming real for Skeeter, this is not the film to be logical (then again are many Happy Gilmore films logical?).  If anything, \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is a straightforward family film that the children can watch and enjoy.  I watched the film with my six-year-old son and he absolutely enjoyed it.<br /><br />With the release of the film on Blu-ray, the fact that this film had so many outdoor shots and a good balance of action and sci-fi scenes, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has been on the winning end in bringing films out to Blu-ray with great picture and audio quality and \\"Bedtime Stories\\" does not disappoint.  And the fact that you get the DVD and a digital copy on disc, that's another positive reasonto own this film in my book.<br /><br />Overall, what I really enjoyed is how the film incorporated so many elements from sci-fi films, action films of old, and balancing it with comedy.  It was a fun film and definitely not a film to take seriously (and again, I feel like I repeat this each time with many Happy Gilmore related films that I review).  So, if you are looking for a fun family film that the children will definitely enjoy, \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is definitely recommended!r made everyone laugh and how he was good with the children.  How Rob Schneider would make Adam Sandler laugh and much more.      * Cutting Room Flor: Deleted Scenes - Ten minutes worth of 12 deleted and extended scenes.    The Blu-ray is also BD-Live enabled with movie chat, movie mail and Disney Movie Rewards Live.    The included DVD features a special feature not included on the Blu-ray disc:        * Dylan & Cole Sprouse: Blu-ray is Suite - \\"The Suite Life of Zach & Cody\\" talents star in a six minute special feature promoting Blu-ray technology.

B001PA0FF4|5.0|Amazing performances from Streep, Hoffman, Adams and Davis.  `DOUBT' is a thought provoking film that leaves you feeling a bit unsettled at the film's end.<br /><br />\\"DOUBT\\" is a film based on the Tony Award winning play \\"Doubt: A Parable\\" by John Patrick Shanley.  The play was so successful would take the popular play and bring it to the big screen and Shanley would be the screen writer and director.<br /><br />Eventually, the film struck a chord with critics as \\"DOUBT\\" received five Academy Award nominations for Best Actress (Meryl Streep), Best Supporting Actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Best Supporting Actress Amy Adams and Viola Davis and Best Adapted Screenplay (John Patrick Shanley).  And after watching the film, you realize that this film and the talents are definitely deserving of each of those nominations.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"DOUBT\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ration of 1:85:1.  The picture quality is very good as you can see the pores on the skin of Philip Seymour Hoffman, so it is done quite well.  But the film is mostly shot indoors.  The colors are not so vibrant as the sisters and Father Flynn are typically wearing black and white.  The school is featured in shades of brown and when shots are done outdoors, skies are gray and definitely not scenes that showcase much colors.  In a way, there is a sort of darkness when watching the film, even though it is a film that takes place in a Catholic school.<br /><br />Cinematography courtesy of the talent Director of Photography Roger Deakins (\\"No Country for Old Men\\", \\"Shawshank Redemption\\", \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" and many more), Deakins knows how to capture a mood and since he is one of my favorite DP's, he manages to capture light and dark moods of the film.<br /><br />As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-Bit) and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  One thing that really came out quite well through my system in hearing the various soundtrack in DTS-HD is the music.  From the choir to the score, it comes out quite clear during the film.  For the most part, the film is dialogue-based.  Dialogue is clear but this is not a film to expect major usage of your rear channels.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"DOUBT\\" comes with several informative special features:<br /><br />  * From Stage to Screen--(19:06) An intimate discussion with playwright, screenwriter and director John Patrick Shanley about the history of \\"Doubt\\", including his inspirations for the story, the acclaim the play's Broadway run received, the Pulitzer Prize and the process of adapting it for the screen. Joining the conversation are Meryl Streep and Sister Margaret McEntee (a consultant on the film and Shanley's former teacher).<br />  * Scoring Doubt--(4:37) Renowned composer Howard Shore discusses his inspiration for the music in the film and his collaboration with both John Patrick Shanley and producer Scott Rudin.<br />  * The Sisters of Charity--(6:28) In an insightful and lively dialogue, Meryl Streep and John Patrick Shanley discuss the interviews that Shanley did before shooting with real nuns to discuss their lives and make sure they would be accurately portrayed in the film.<br />  * Feature Commentary with John Patrick Shanley - (103 minutes) For the commentary, we get a bit of insight of John Patrick Shanley's experience of going to a Catholic school in the Bronx and trying to utilize what he remembers and making it come to life on film.  Shanley talks about the various talent, various scenes and how certain shots came about.<br />  * The Cast of Doubt-- (13:30) Ew.com's discussion with actors Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis.  A fun and insightful conversation with the talent and their feeling about the film and if the critics would get it.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"DOUBT\\" is a thought provoking film.  Taking what we have seen in the last decade with certain pastors accused andhaving gotten away for child molestation, \\"DOUBT\\" tries to show viewers that even back in 1964, a perspective of how this was happening and despite some people having doubts about a priest and a few of those individuals with a close relationship with the younger altar boys, what makes this film much more entertaining is watching Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman really going off each other and both delivering powerful performances.<br /><br />Meryl Streep's transformation to Sister Aloysius is just impressive and her ability to project intimidation to even the viewer showcases her multiple-award winning talent.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is just a man who is well liked but to Sister Aloysius, it's about how far she will go to use her intimidation against him.  But as intimidating as she is to the Father.  The truth is that the system and hierarchy of how things are handled in the church reside in the leadership of men, not so much towards the women.  So, Hoffman then engages in intimidation towards Sister Aloysius.  Needless to say, the exchange between both individuals is quite powerful.  Which one of these individuals engages in their own perfidy?<br /><br />The other impressive performances go to Amy Adams as Sister Jane.  She exhibits innocence, purity and someone trying to comprehend why Sister Aloysius is the way she is and if she can possibly bring something new to the school with her warmer style.  Unfortunately, this style is similar to Father Flynn's and a style that Sister Aloysius is against.  So, to see the fear and intimidation that the Sister Jane is feeling is well projected by Adams.<br /><br />And Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller.  Despite having only several minutes on screen, her performance as a mother who has seen her son tormented and defeated, beaten and made to feel as an outcast, is willing to let him allegedly be in the companionship of the father, because he is the only person that has been there to protect him.  Twisted logic it may be, but considering the time this film takes place and that he was the sole Black person being integrated into the school, you feel sympathy for Mrs. Douglas but at the same time feel a bit disgusted.  Nevertheless, Viola Davis really did a great job portraying the mother in this film.<br /><br />\\"DOUBT\\" is indeed a powerful and though provoking film.  The final minutes leave you feeling a bit unsettled.  But the film is indeed a pleasure to watch because of the power of the performances by the four key talents of the film.<br /><br />They made their characters so believable and because of that, \\"DOUBT\\" was able to flourish into this intriguing and gripping film.  By the end of the film, you have no doubt in your mind that Streep, Hoffman, Adams and Davis were definitely deserving of their Academy Award nominations.  Highly recommended!4, a perspective of how this was happening and despite some people having doubts about a priest and a few of those individuals with a close relationship with the younger altar boys, what makes this film much more entertaining is watching Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman really going off each other and both delivering powerful performances.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I tried out this workout on our ON DEMAND feature...and then had my hubby pick up a copy of the dvd for me.  This workout has eveything I love about working out -- simple, old school, real movement and challenging!  I love that there is no choreography to learn and love just getting down to business!<br /><br />I even decided to create a 3-2-1 Pilates workout for myself and some of my pilates clients.  We use the reformer, mat, and jumpboard to create a similarly fast paced 30 minute workout!<br /><br />People who don't have a lot of time can do this workout and really feel great afterwords.

0783225733|5.0|On April 13th, 1970, Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert, are sent to the moon for a lunar landing to gather moon rocks for scientific study. The race for the moon is over, and America isn't even interested anymore in `routine' flights to the moon anymore. That is until reports come in that there is major trouble going on on the spacecraft. As the pilots are on their way to the moon, an explosion happens somewhere inside their ship. Major problem after major problem begins to happen. The routine mission to the moon has just become an intellectual fight for survival... and now a mission to get home. 250 thousand miles in space inside a ship that feels like the size of two phone booths, Jim, Fred, and Jack use their brains and their guts to fly to the dark side of the moon to slingshot themselves hopefully back to earth. Power is diminishing, Carbon Dioxide is building, engines are failing, and the freezing cold is piercing. The true story of Apollo 13.<br /><br />Never gets old. No matter how many times I see this movie, it just never gets old. I've probably seen it at least 5 times now and I'm still glued to my seat. How is this a real story? Honestly it's so miraculous and incredible the things that happened and the things that were done to get these guys home that it seems fake. But it's not. It's crazy to think how close to death these guys were in such a foreign area such as space. Even the guys in Houston were having a hard time believing that so much was going wrong at one time. At one time the crew had to sit in the lunar lander to fly home. The thing about that is that most of the walls are just a millimeter thick (not even that much). So they had to watch where they stretched out so they didn't puncture a whole in the wall and suck themselves out.<br /><br />Ron Howard's direction of the movie was incredible. Not once did I get bored. Everything was done just right. From the story, to the characters, the little jokes here and there, to the action, to the suspense. It's got it all. And with a cast that consists of Tom Hanks (Lovell), Bill Paxton (Haise), Kevin Bacon (Swigert), Gary Sinise (Ken Mattingly), and Ed Harris (Gene Kranz), how could you really go wrong? Every performance was littered with emotion for the story or for who they were playing. It seemed like everyone wanted to do their best to make this movie memorable for us as the viewer, and more importantly for the people who they portrayed and the story that was being told.<br /><br />After the movie was over this time, I was still caught up in the story so I immediately pushed play on The Making of Apollo 13. I HIGHLY recommend watching this. There was a LOT of real footage used in this documentary. From Nixon's speech to seeing the actual ship that exploded float off to space while we get to see the actual damage. Incredible. Also it's really neat to see how spot on the movie was to the actual event that happened. While the doc is going on, parts of the movie would happen, and then we'd see or hear the actual events happen (or vice versa...I can't remember). It was really cool to hear \\"Houston we have a problem\\" from Lovell himself. And while they do show a lot of actual events, they also show some really funny stuff too. Watching how they did the floating in space parts was really cool. I've known about airplane flights that take you up and then drop real fast to give you the zero gravity feel. I actually looked into doing last year but it's a tad expensive (like a thousand bucks...eesh). I just didn't really think they would do it. But they did. A lot of the shots are actually in an airplane doing this and the actors all did it. It was funny to watch them floating around and then hit the bottom of the plane when the plane would come up from the dive.<br /><br />In the end, I highly recommend this movie for anyone. Incredible movie on an incredible true event in America's history.<br /><br />P.S. What happened to Kevin Bacon? Like he looks like a normal guy in this movie, but man he's starting to look a lot like Skeletor in more of his recent movies.mal guy in this movie, but man he's starting to look a lot like Skeletor in more of his recent movies.

1563899426|4.0|Snow White's divorced?!  Prince Charming's a freeloader?!  The Big Bad Wolf's a hard-boiled human detective?!  Never since Alan Moore's \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" has a comic turned Storybook Land on its head (from what I've read so far).    A series created by Bill Willingham and Lan Medina, \\"Fables\\" follows the exploits of exiled fantasy characters living in the contemporary world.  Vol. 1 brings the aforementioned players together for a bloody murder mystery--with beasts, ogres and talking pigs--complete with the classic 'parlor scene' where the detective rounds up the suspects and reveals all.  The backstory of the comic, and the written short story on the Wolf's origins, is just a bit more interesting.  But it just goes to show that life's no fairy tale.    This comic is suggested for mature readers: Violence, Adult Language, Adult Situations.
0156013983|5.0|This story was a pleasure to read in French. It portrays a child's wonderment and how we lose the ability to see with our hearts as adults. The story is creative and it reminded me of my own \\"invisible friend\\" as a child. The only thing I did not like about this story was the ending. The little prince, with a help of a snake goes back to his planet after a year on Earth. It is a little dark, but perhaps that is just the adult in me seeing with my eyes and not my heart. I give this story 5 out of 5. I wrote more about this book on my blog Amanda's Weekly Zen...<br /><br />[...]

B00133KFGW|5.0|I have all of Alex O'Loughlin's work on DVD, so of course I had to add August Rush. I had seen it in the theater after discovering Alex on Moonlight. Alex would have been cast as the lead of this film, but was told that a \\"bigger name\\" was needed. Alex was still fairly new to the industry in the US after being a leading man in Australia. I admire his bravery, coming to the US and basically starting over from scratch. He is a brilliant talent, and should have had the lead in this movie. Since JRM was chosen due to his \\"bigger name\\", the part of Marshall Connelly was made larger for Alex since he made such an impression. In my opinion, as always, Alex outshines everyone else in this film. I saw it at the theater and then bought the DVD - just for Alex. Alex is Australian and can do any accent - his Irish accent as Marshall is impeccable. I actually have a friend who is Irish, and she said that it was funny that Alex's accent was better than JRM's, since JRM is Irish.  Alex also plays his own guitar and sings in the scenes where they show the brothers' band days, and his talent shines through there as well.<br />I have known people who didn't know who Alex was when they saw August Rush (Moonlight had just premiered. Then when they did see him in Moonlight and in some of his other movies later, they said, \\"oh, that's the guy I liked so much in August Rush!\\" No matter how small the part, Alex always makes an unforgettable impression.<br />Bottom line - buy this movie and enjoy Alex O'Loughlin. You will be glad you did.

0061339202|5.0|According to the author, the bringing of order to consciousness, control of the mind, is the key to happiness. This theory has had an extensive impact since it surfaced in academnic journals 30 years ago for, it is a \\"meta-theory\\" that is applicable to any type of human activity such as sex, work, friendship, loneliness and lifelong learning. However, in order to work, \\"flow\\" needs \\"free-will\\": it will be those individuals who can generate their own flow experiences who will tend to be happier. Flow helps to integrate the self because in that state of deep concentration, consciousness is usually well ordered. \\"Flow\\" has been described in various disciplines by different names. Athletes call it \\"being in the zone\\". Mystics describe it as \\"ecstasy\\". Artists term it \\"rapture\\". The book's best description of flow come from the zen masters. Zen masters will describe flow as \\"just doing\\". A long time ago I, published an article about it. You can secure it from me for free by writing to Dr Jusuf Hariman at J.hariman@optusnet.com.au. Lastly, the author discerns \\"enjoyment \\" and \\"pleasure\\". Mere pleasure does not engage our being and does little for our psychic development. On the other hand, people in \\"enjoyment\\" are actively engage is something meaningful and do a great deal in our psychic development.
B001B223TW|2.0|Alas, I must dissent from the reviews already posted.  It is often said that Il Trovatore requires the four best singers in the world, and this performance does not rise to that level.  Clearly, this production is meant to showcase Hvorostovsky, whose burnished tone, silken legato, and sensitive singing is always a pleasure, but he is not really a Verdi Baritone (in short supply these days), and his voice is not really large enough for this part.  However, his big aria - Il Balen - is splendid.  Tenor Cura is a big guy with a big voice, but his voice is improperly placed (in the throat) and loses what little focus it has as it rises to the high notes.  Soprano Villarroel has several weaknesses:  She seems to be singing with a mouth full of Gummy Bears; she has no proper trill, and her pianissimo is oddly detached from the rest of the voice.    Opus Arte has a fine track record with their Blu-ray releases (I have several), but they have stumbled here.  The photography is grainy, and produces generous amounts of digital noise in many of the scenes.  This is perhaps exacerbated by the dimly lit production, not to mention the lavish amounts of fake fog which appears repeatedly for no apparent reason.  It often quite difficult to see what was going on, and several poor singers found themselves totally in the dark.  The sets were fine (what one could see of them), but the crowd scenes were a mess, with the choristers seeming to mill about at random.    If you want to see Hvorostovsky's \\"Il Balen\\", you can find it on YouTube, but I cannot recommend this very disappointing Blu-ray release.

Alex was already a leading man in Australia before coming to the US, and had to start over from scratch in the US industry. I admire his courage and persistence. After starting out with this small part, he is now a huge success.<br />Alex O'Loughlin fans - buy this for your Alex Collection! You will be glad that you did.

0066620996|5.0|To call Good to Great merely a business book might actually do it a disservice, because like any outstanding creative work, it not only speaks to its subject and its time, but transcends those to address bigger truths about human nature. I hope to some day start my own business (which is when I will be sure to review the many valuable insights), but even if that never comes to pass, I will still consider it time well spent.<br /><br />From a rational standpoint it's reassuring to read about the rigorous methodologies and reams of data the author and his team went through, but from my perspective the really interesting part was the lessons they synthesized from these great leaders, and the nicely-phrased comments Collins often makes to sum up said lessons. For example, \\"expending energy to motivate people is largely a waste of time . . . if you have the right people on the bus, they will be self-motivated.\\" On this and countless other observations I found myself thinking Yes, this is how people are, and this is how they work.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend it more highly.

0525951113|2.0|This books starts of like dynamite...the premise really grabs you. Unfortunately after you finish the first half, things get a little bizarro and out of control. You get as lost in what is happening in the book like the characters of the novel are lost in the real life computer game. The ending is atrocious...a total mish-mash resulting in a mess. I think the author is trying for a desconstructed social order but to what? There are no conclusions, no sense, just bad philosophizing nonsense. Maybe he is working on a sequel but I'm quite skeptical. The most difficult part about writing a thriller is figuring out a logical conclusion. Mr. Saurez fails. The last chapter is a total cop out. I did enjoy the first half of the book and hope that effort number two hits the mark a little better. I am not writing off this author just yet, but he had better get better with this outlandish plot if I'm going to give him any money.    I fortunately got this from the library. I have a Kindle but refuse to go over $9.99 for an ebook and would have been a little miffed if I had purchased it in view of the ridiculous ending.
0143038419|1.0|It is this month's selection for my book club and I am forcing myself to get through it, but feeling extremely resentful about the waste of my time. She is a competent writer, but maybe better off writing on topics other than herself. If you are going to spend time reading a memoir, a basic rule of thumb is that the memoirist needs to be someone you think you might enjoy spending time with. Liz Gilbert does not strike me as that sort of person. She is not interesting enough to be so self-absorbed. So, apart from her tip that there is a restaurant in Naples that serves the best pizza on the planet, I find little to commend about this book.
1595822003|5.0|Frankenstein is by far one of the greatest books ever written.  Few other novels measure up to it.  I did not realize this the first time I read it, when it was required reading for high school.  At that time, I hated it.  But, as was usual in my high school experience, the life was sucked out of it and it was greatly misinterpreted by the teacher.  So, if you have had such a reading experience with this book, please do not judge it based on that.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with the actual tale presented in this work of literary brilliance, please pay NO attention to Hollywood's portrayal of the story.  This is not a tale about a scary, soulless, killing machine that goes on a rampage whilst the poor, defenseless creator sits back helplessly and innocently.  It is a sad, touching tale about abandonment, prejudice, acceptance, and much more.  In reading it, you will discover who the true monster of the tale is - and it isn't the poor creature.<br /><br />As for this edition of the novel, I think that it is fantastic.  I love this books so much that I really felt that I needed to have a hardcover edition.  I'm very happy that I selected this one.  The illustrations are excellent and plentiful.  I am easily amused, so I was delighted to discover that the book has a ribbon attached to the spine so you can easily mark your pages.  This is by far one of the most unique books in my collection.  I love it.  Buy it!
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I thought this movie and Angelina Jolie were outstanding.  Surprised it didn't get more exposure.  I loved the period clothes as well.  I didn't know the movie was based on fact and it actually happened.  It truly shows how strong a Mother's love is for a child.  Kudos to Clint Eastwood as Director.  This one was definitely underrated in my opinion.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|I saw all the rave reviews of this movie and so I didn't bother to rent it first...I went out and bought it.<br /><br />What a let down!  All the hype had me anticipating something fresh, new, and original.  NOT.<br /><br />This is a typical vampire story about a young girl who needs a human (kind of like the relationship between Dracula and Renfield).  Her adult human helper is so stupid and inadequate that one wonders if this was supposed to be a comedy.<br /><br />Alas, it is supposed to be a serious movie.<br /><br />When her adult human helper dies (no surprise here), the little girl befriends the boy next door (literally).<br /><br />Nothing new here.  Everything is predictible.  Sometimes the badness of the movie made me wince.<br /><br />Now on to the English dubbing.  It is badly read and very wooden.  So I changed to the original language using English subtitles.  Much better.<br /><br />Still, no subtitles can save this movie.<br /><br />If you are such a vampire buff that you want every single vampire movie ever made, buy Let the Right One In.<br /><br />Otherwise, steer clear.  This movie has been done before (again and again), and there is nothing special about it.  Rent it if you have to, then move on.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|A well crafted album that sounds great on you head phones and then you discover whole new levels of sublime when you listen to it on a good sound system.  It easily makes it in my top ten albums of all time.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I purchased this cd primarily because I liked her first one, \\"Taylor Swift\\". I normally expect to really love a few of the tracks, with most of the rest falling into the mediocre category. Not with this album! I found I love each and every track. My favorite (if there is one) would be \\"You Belong To Me\\".
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I disagree with the bulk of reviewers.  Following Chris Cornell's career from the beginning, this is an evolution of his vocal prowess, granted it is not Audioslave or Soundgarden.  Singing layering harmonies, lyrics which are enunciated, deep, and catchy. The more you listen, the more you appreciate this CD.  From a 30+ year metalhead, I highly recommend this techno work as a way of allowing this genre to be appreciated, much like the ballads of the \\"hairband era\\" were embraced.  Hopefully Chris will form a new super rock band and follow his roots, with ripping guitar and screaming vocals we can understand.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Another wonderful movie that was overlooked and underrated.  Nicole Kidman showed a bit of a comedic side at times that was a refreshing surprise.  Of course the scenery goes without saying.  This movie touched just about all emotions.  Too bad it didn't play in theatres for a longer period of time, as it would be even more enjoyable to watch on the big screen.
B00103584Y|5.0|REALLY GOOD.  This one demonstrates how fate and split second timing can make all the difference in the outcome of any event.<br /><br />Although the final outcome was a bit of a reach, I forgave that tiny misstep because the movie as a whole was exciting and extremely original.<br /><br />Not for everyone, but if you have an open mind, Run Lola Run is a must-see.  This is a plot (or multiple plots) that I can honestly say I have never seen before.<br /><br />Because Run Lola Run is not to everyone's tastes, I suggest you rent it first before buying.  I did rent it, and I am going to buy Run Lola Run this week.  I want Run Lola Run in my blu-ray collection.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Let The Right One\\" in is by far the most original Vampire movie I've seen. It will unfortunately get unjustified comparisons to \\"Twilight\\" seeing the closeness of the plots and release dates. The story follows the puny and shy Oscar who constantly gets beat on by his classmates. By beat on, I mean quite harshly, one altercation results in Oscar nearly going deaf in one ear. His world is a lonely and terrifying one until he notices he has a new neighbor who is a little odd seeing that they keep the windows covered during the day. One fateful night Oscar meets the young girl next door who \\"Smells funny\\" and a bizarre yet endearing friendship ensues. Eli is a vampire who \\"has been 12 a very long time\\" and she acts as Oscar's guardian and adviser as he learns to stand up for himself against the brutalities of childhood. While doing so Eli leans that she can still have human compassion while no longer being human herself. \\"Let The Right One In\\" is a jewel of a film in a genre that has produced some awful films. It's haunting, at times terrifying and strangely touching. One of the best movies of the year.
B001JNNDGA|4.0|The new blu-ray version of this movie is out and what can I say about it?  The image looks great. Defenitly one of the best looking film in blu-ray. At least for me one of the problems is the fact the special features are place in a standard DVD which is a shame.
0385340990|4.0|This book is best described as a \\"gentle\\" read. The story, though written in letter format, flows beatifully and the characters are all people you want to know and spend time with. I enjoyed this book immensely.<br />Additionally, I previously knew nothing of the blockading of the Channel Islands and it has inspired me to learn more.
0312427999|5.0|[[ASIN:0312427999 The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism]]    This is an amazing book.  I am tagging and underlining in every page.  It really covers the history of Neocon's and their disasterous effect of the world's economy.  This is a must read for every working and middle class person who wonders what's happening to the world as they knew it. It is a great counterpoint to Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and what we're hearing from CEO's.
B0002858YS|4.0|Hot Fuss is one of the best albums of 2004. It's an unapologetic, '80s-influenced album that sounds surprisingly fresh. The hit singles, including the gender-bending \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" the darkly sexual \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" and the pseudo-soulful \\"All These Things that I've Done\\" are as diverse as they are infectious and impeccably crafted. The expertly over-produced cuts don't end there, though. \\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" \\"Change Your Mind,\\" and \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" capture a sound that's at once apathetic and anthemic in its youthful excess. On Hot Fuss, The Killers create excellent pop music without taking themselves too seriously; that approach has been missing from their recent work. By the time you've listened to the whole CD, it all seems a bit overwhelming, but isn't that the point? If you can, get the special edition with the excellent \\"Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll.\\" 4 Stars.
0440238609|5.0|This boxed trilogy is amazing! The books come in sort of a hard box, and they're shiny and beautiful. I do recommend getting this box set for the quality of the product as well as the low price.
B0000UN25A|5.0|It struck me one day while listening to Joe Cocker - the man has a real feel for the blues and rhythm and blues.  His phrasing is some of the best around. So I made up my own compilation of his blues and RnB, and listen to it all of the time.  As long as you don't have to look at his writhing on stage or listen to Up Where We Belong and You Are So Beautiful, you got yourself a true treasure of a singer.<br /><br />One of my favorite songs by him, Ruby Lee, is on the album Organic, which I highly recommend.  Bill Withers really does this song justice. He wrote it, but listen to white guy, Welsh boy Joe Joe Cocker lay on the beat on the song if you get a chance.  Good God almighty, that's some RnB regardless of the color of Cocker's skin.  The live version on this Ultimate Collection is not on the USA version I don't believe, but you can listen to it on youtube at [...] . I don't know who that is on the guitar, but the man can play.  Drums and backup singers are hitting it right too.<br /><br />I'd recommend Sheffield Steel and Organic if you want some Joe Cocker soul.  Funny how people from the British Isles can get black music right.  I don't care to analyze it.  I just listen to it, and know that the angels in my heaven don't play harps.  They sing soul, blues and real RnB, so I'm being good so I go up when I die, and not down where 2009 RnB, rap and new country music would be jabbed at me on pitchforks, but I digress as I rant.  Joe Cocker deserves your attention if you want good singing, good backup and good choosing of songs.  He ain't a pretty boy, but he sings real pretty for the people.[[ASIN:B000002BRQ Organic]][[ASIN:B00006LWQ7 Sheffield Steel]]

It was the worst ever and I paid full price.

B001RQ0SJO|5.0|When I first discovered Bat for Lashes last year, I was thrilled. I couldn't believe I was lucky enough to find such a unique and fascinating artist. I downloaded \\"Two Suns\\" as soon as I could (11:30 pm last night, it came out early!) and get to listening. The first single, \\"Daniel\\" is a love song with that fantastical touch. It's easily the most \\"catchy\\" and I liked it as soon as I heard it. I love the kind of asian type strings in the melody. The first track \\"Glass\\" is an amazing opener. It starts off slow, ethereal and quickly picks up pace. The drums in this are great, and the lyrics in this song are probably my favorite, although every song on this album has beautifully crafted lyrics. From \\"Moon and Moon\\" to \\"Pearl's Dream\\" its full of complete goodness. I especially love the first 7 tracks. \\"Siren Song\\" and \\"Pearl's Dream\\" are two sides of the same coin. These songs are meant to be heard back to back. The whole album, honestly should be heard in order. I'm sure the sequence is all apart of BFL's storytelling. Overall, I would highly recommend this album, especially if you already are a fan. Natasha takes all the elements that worked in \\"Fur and Gold\\" and builds on them in \\"Two Suns\\" to the point that I might dare say its better, or if not, equal to her amazing debut. She continues to fascinate and demand your attention with music and lyrics that are as visual as watching a film.
1582701709|1.0|Isn't it great when the cosmos not only gives you permission, but indeed helps you to manifest your innermost longings, no matter what they are. This book is actually about 20 years past it's time. It should have been released in the 80s for the yuppie generation. GREED IS GOOD, as long as you don't call it greed and mask the true nature of the endeavor. This book can work for someone who does not want to see the greed, jealousy, and selfishness connected to it. I'm not saying the book is all wrong, just it's primary emphasis. But why take my word for it, maybe this Buds for you.
B000002H33|5.0|From the other 1200+ reviews, its obvious that this album is a gem.  Every single song on this album will blow your mind.  The music is technical, aggressive, and above all enjoyable to listen to.  The highlights of the album in my opinion are:    Master of Puppets- The speedy riffs and beautiful interlude make this song one of the best.    The Thing That Should Not Be- one of the more less appreciated songs on this album, but it is the heaviest song by far in Metallica's first three albums.  This song's lyrics are some of the best too, considering it is about HP Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness.  Read that story and you will love this song even more.    Welcome Home (Sanitarium)- This song has it all... good lyrics, riffs, solos, and that catchyness that even not metal fans can enjoy.    Orion- Cliff's musical knowledge and ability comes out in this song.  The interlude and bass solo are sweet music to my ears.    All in all, this album probably did more for Metal than any other and single-handedly influenced generations of rockers.
B001W79MB8|5.0|I watched this movie almost a year ago.  Ever sense then I have been waiting for it to be released on Blu ray and DVD.  The story is fairly decent, but the animation and action put this movie over the top.  The action sequences are fast paced high impact and will make you want to watch them several times over just so you can catch all of it.  The final battle in the movie is the best sword fight scene I have ever seen.   I highly recommend this movie for sword fighting anime enthusiast.

1554072840|4.0|This book lets you talk about using the potty in a calm manner. It may not convince your daughter to use the potty but it gets her thinking about it.
1416972242|5.0|This is a great follow-up to City of Bones.  Here Jace is just as moody as the first book.  Times you love him, times you hate him.  Magnus is back in the book as well and much more likable than the first book.  Valentine is still up to no good; Clary is still torn between Simon and Jace.  Simon has an interesting turn of fate in this book by becoming a vampire.  There are some close calls when Clary thinks she's lost Simon.  Also this love/attraction between Jace and Clary ventures on the lines of being sick; they are brother and sister after all.  But are they?  This question is neatly hidden in the book and I'm eager to find out how much they are alike and just what the Inquisitor was going to tell Jace before her demise.  A new character is introduced in this book as well, a young werewolf Miaia.  Will something develop between Simon and Miaia?  Alec will also come very close to admitting to his parents his romance with Magnus.  This is kind of strange, not in the fact that they are both guys, but in the fact that Magnus is so much older than Alec.  However, it's nice to not see him mooning so badly over Jace in this book.<br /><br />This was good book and I did like it better than the first.  Its action packed from start to end.  Like the first book, this isn't for the younger reader, but teens and adults, like me, will enjoy it.  This is defiantly one of those series that stay on my bookshelf.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This was an excellent movie which we will watch many times. Baz Luhrmann has created another classic.
0375826726|4.0|Many people have droned on and on about how horrible this book is, how boring, how simplistic, etc.  While I beg to differ,I think it is important to remember that Paolini wrote this to be young adult fantasy.  Of course its not going to be Tolkein! Of course things might be restated several times, and of course its going to be angsty.  Come on people!    That being said, I'm almost at the end of the third book, and cannot wait for the fourth.  Its a saga for sure, but well written (if not verbose), but a good story all the same.
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is a pleasure and this memoir was a deeply affirming and encouraging message to me.
B00008EUMA|5.0|To me, \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Countdown\\" were Megadeth's finest hour. Dave Mustaine really polished his craft by this time and the stars finally aligned for Megadeth.<br /><br />With this album, Dave Mustaine showed that metal and thrash weren't about a bunch of greasy kids bitching that their parents didn't love them or moping that they didn't get laid.  \\"Rust in Peace\\" focuses on religious wars, nuclear fear, government conspiracies, the occult, history, and the affects of pollution. It demonstrates that people involved and interested in thrash and metal music are aware and have real concerns, hopes, fears, and ideas about the state of the world.<br /><br />Musically, Dave and Co. hit it out of the park with this one. The band really had it together and sounded like a blue-printed and balanced American V-8 engine.  \\"Holy Wars...\\" begins the album sounding like the first primed start of a brand new, hand made engine that finally rumbles to life, promising to destroy all the competition.  Next is \\"Hangar 18\\" with inverted triads leading first to melodies and pristine harmonies complementing the chord changes, then leading to a dueling guitar solo that gets better and better until the end.  \\"Take No Prisoners\\" starts out with a frantic riff that resolves to a brisk march and military cadence call-and-response theme that keeps the energy going.  \\"Five Magic's\\" starts dark and enchanting and becomes almost epic in the size of the sound produced in the verse and chorus sections, aided by the lyrical content and style. This is my favorite song of the album.  The rest of the album kicks just as much a$$ and should be a part of any true appreciating music enthusiast.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album, especially on vinyl: the way it was intended when it first came out in 1990.
0060752610|5.0|Shortly after WWII, Benjamin Graham wrote this book. If there was only one book I could recommend you read on investing, it would be this one. This was one of the first investment books I read myself and I understood it. My second read of it revealed even more. It is fairly long, but with an understanding of all the concepts in this book, you could invest in individual stocks with success. I prefer the edition with a forward by Warren Buffett and chapter by chapter commentary by Jason Zweig [[ASIN:0060555661 The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing. A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition)]]. It will help you apply Graham's principals to today's economy.
B0017WCG48|5.0|Cliff Burton's influence in the band is very evident on this album. Lars Ulrich oftens credits that Cliff had an understanding of time signature, syncopation, and melody that the rest didn't. This knowledge heavily influenced the band and progressed over Cliff's short but important tenure in the band. Due primarily to the fact that Cliff was the only band member to take formal lessons and study music theory during a short stint in college positively affected the orchestrations on this album. This is why many people consider Cliff so important to Metallica's history.<br /><br />Each song on the album is technically amazing. The melodies on the middle section of \\"Orion\\" are beautiful and create a serene mood. The melancholy words and chord progressions of \\"Sanitarium\\" remind me of RP McMurphy in \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest\\". \\"Master of Puppets\\" menacing intro of percussive staccato guitar breaks set the stage for the theme of a person controlled/enslaved by substance abuse. I wonder if that song is a call to Dave Mustanie to clean up? Every song on this album is unique and has something to say about our culture. \\"Leper Messaih\\", \\"Damge Inc.\\", \\"Battery\\", Disposable Heros\\" each song deals with some heavy subject matter and backs it up with some crazy rhythms, melodies, chord progressions, and motifs that Metallica just don't or can't recreate anymore.<br /><br />Every time I pick this album up to play it I feel like I am holding a legend in my hands. Metallica really peaked with this album and the only thing that ever came close, though in a completely different way, was the Black album. They still haven't replicated the passion, anger, and pure artistry that Cliff brought out of them on this album.<br /><br />As for the 45 rpm re-master. I do agree with the other reviewers that it sounds a little washed out. I feel that may have something to do with James and Lars, but I've talked about their approach to the mixing console in previous album reviews (if you care to read). This album was intended for the vinly format and it is a joy to listen and experience it that way.  I would like to hear the 33 rpm pressing to make a better comparison. I will say that I do enjoy the gatefold and clear inner artwork. So if you are a collector this is probably worth it. I do own the gold cd re-masters and I must say that they are much cleaner sounding then the original.read).

B001D2AYCI|5.0|Rejoice, people - this is truly the exception from the \\"rule\\" that new remasters are worse than the older CD editions! This is probably THE BEST sounding \\"Paranoid\\" CD.    It's definitly better than 1996 Castle CD and 2004 Black Box release (don't believe what J. Siegler says). There are some other CD editions which I have never (or a long time ago) listened to, but I don't think they are better.  And there's edition which I own for some time, 2001 Sanctuary \\"mini vinyl replicas\\" 8-disc box-set.  This new 2009 edition is released on the same label - Sanctuary. I must say that guys there know their job. So - congratulations and respect to Sanctuary!    After detailed analysis it seems to me that they used the same source as in 2001, but remastered it in a different way. Both 2001 and 2009 editions have loudness boosting just very slightly over the edge, basically unnoticeable, which makes them incomparably better than most of today's releases with ridiculously boosted loudness. So there's almost NO trace of small dynamic range, distortion and compression.  When I compared 2001 and 2009 edition:  2001 has LESS NOISE and MORE BASS; 2001 sounds muddy, with prominent low range, while 2009 sounds more natural, with prominent mid-range.  They both sound good, and eventually it's up to the listener to decide which sound he/she prefers. I'm not 100% sure which one sounds closer to the original 1970 vinyl (I could know that only if I put that LP in mint condition on a high-end turnatable and make comparison - but that will never happen)... but my final conclusion is: I think that this 2009 CD is the closest thing to the original record.    This new remaster also came out as a double LP - if someone is interested in that. That vinyl edition should sound even better, if you have the right equipment in your home.    All this being said, for me the most important value of this new edition is not remastered sound of the original album (disc 1), but bonus tracks.    Disc 2 is NOT CD, but DVD, which contains 1974 QUADROPHONIC MIX of \\"Paranoid\\". I'm not really interested in that, but I know there are some who are. DVD has menu, where you can choose the songs and audio options (stereo or 5.1), and after the playback starts, you have video too! Nothing important, but nice - different pictures (artwork from all Sabbath releases related to \\"Paranoid\\") move on screen in the tempo of current song.    I didn't know and didn't believe that disc 1 will have such a superior sound, so the reason why I ordered this was disc 3. It contains those 8 album tracks, but in a way that no-one has ever heard before! Because they are in fact studio out-takes: 5 of them are instrumentals and 3 are alternative versions! All unreleased for 38 years and 9 months! Maybe some will not be thrilled with that, but I am. It was fantastic experience to listen those songs, which are full of interesting surprises; gives you completely new listening experience of that classic.    Also, there's beautiful 24-page booklet, with tons of linear notes (haven't read them, but some say they are not too great) and related pictures, even from the original Paranoid tour programme.    And one more thing...  From what I heard, it was a long, hard battle... between Tony Iommi camp and record company... maybe even for a couple of years. This release was several times announced and then stopped at the last moment. But I guess now that Mr. Iommi definitely lost legal battles. There are already announcements of releasing the other Sabbath classics as expanded deluxe editions. I feel that we won't have to wait much to get \\"Master of reality\\" unreleased out-takes...    I'm sorry if all this happened against the will of Iommi & Sabbath, I do respect them and their wishes, but only up to a point - because as much I love Sabbath, even more I love myself. :) And I really WANT Sabbath unreleased stuff... me and thousands of other Sabbath fans. And I feel that we are true fans, even if we'll give money for something that Iommi didn't want to see the light of the day. And these 2001 and 2009 Sanctuary releases, although without blessing from the band, are infinitely better products than 2004 Black Box which had all the blessings.
B000OHZJLY|5.0|Pretty much every rock fan knows about the the early history of Elvis Costello...from [[ASIN:B000UAE86C My Aim Is True]] to whatever he happens to have been doing in the last decade from collaberations with Burt Bacharach and Allen Toussaint to one (or two maybe) classical projects. Either way around it this one seems to have gotton away from me.I had no idea he recorded it,none of the songs seem at all familiar and it looks like I am definately not the only one who feels that way. So whatever:Costello was obviously pretty content at this point to hang on 180 here because this album doesn look or sound like any Elvis Costello & The Attractions album before it. If you want to make the obvious Beatles comparasin (it's one worth making though) you could look at his previous album [[ASIN:B000OHZJLE Trust]] and this as being like the [[ASIN:B000002UAR Revolver [UK]]] and [[ASIN:B000002UAU Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] of his career:both these albums found Costello following the same musical path with a very gradual transition from 3 minute pop to something more psychedlic.Had it all been done?No-this was very very different. With this album Elvis achieved something that was not only thought next to impossible,with some strong exceptions but that would help influence the world of Brit-pop for decades.He was able to integrate the concept of psychedelic effects into songs that were not only very strong but under 5 minutes. The last four songs on thealbum  (as well as the percussive opener \\"Beyond Belief\\"),\\"Pidgin English\\",\\"You Little Fool\\" and especially \\"Town Cryer\\" give you lot's of strings,leslie amp echoes here and there-the works. But in the hand of new producer Geoff Emmerick it's not very clished;you never know what's coming next. On the other hand there are some moments where other styles tried on earlier albums really come into great focus.\\"Shabby Doll\\" is a great song;very soulful and very funky,especially the bassline at the end.If the previous album had Elvis Costello's singing was going too in new directions this really takes the cake!Up and down,from song to song he is leaping into this...really very sexy high alto.I would'nt call it falsetto as it seems very natural.\\"Almost Blue\\" is....just beautiful.It's the title of his very last album but this torchy jazz ballad is definately one of his unsung classics.Same goes for the soulful \\"Human Hands\\".\\"The Long Honeymoon\\",\\"Kid About It\\",\\"Little Savage\\"....well many of things songs are able to be pretty straight ahead and still be innovative. So sure it's forgotton and I'd bet some people give this a good review simply for that purpose:that just because an album is obscure then it's gotta be good. Well that is never entirely true but this is a very strong exception to the rule,as well as being the best place to find the groun zero where post-punk pop met up with....well where the music's gone pretty much today in a lot of ways.f the previous album had Elvis Costello's singing was going too in new directions this really takes the cake!Up and down,from song to song he is leaping into this...really very sexy high alto.I would'nt call it falsetto as it seems very natural.\\"Almost Blue\\" is....just beautiful.It's the title of his very last album but this torchy jazz ballad is definately one of his unsung classics.Same goes for the soulful \\"Human Hands\\".\\"The Long Honeymoon\\",\\"Kid About It\\",\\"Little Savage\\"....well many of things songs are able to be pretty straight ahead and still be innovative.

B0018M6J90|5.0|Miss Guinevere Pettigrew was destined for better things.  A vicar's daughter, she was a well brought up young lady until circumstances (we aren't told what they are, but obviously they were pretty severe) forced her to become a governess in late 1930s London.  She's a cut above all her employers, which means she can never keep a job until one day, through a little underhandedness, she becomes a social secretary to a beautiful but chaotic young American singer.  Miss Pettigrew helps her employer out of several near disasters and is rewarded with a makeover that reveals her true beauty.  She also comes into contact with several men, one of whom eventually recognizes her true worth.<br /><br />This is a funny, sometimes hysterically so, film.  The sets and the costumes are lavish, while the setting, in the last few days of peace before World War II breaks out, is appropriately fraught.  Amid the froth and glitter are some good (but not necessarily profound) insights into real worth and true love.<br /><br />Everyone involved in this film had a lot of fun making it, and it shows.  You'll enjoy it as well.

B0015DYIH2|1.0|SPOILER WARNING...<br /><br />\\"...They're committed to protecting human life, Aro.  That makes them able to coexist with us, but hardly with you.  Unless you are rethinking your lifestyle...\\"<br /><br />This is my favorite line from Breaking Dawn, which describes Jacob's clan of shapechangers.  It depicts the Cullen lifestyle as one which is bent on the preservation of human life, which isn't exactly the case.  In fact, Bella has never been critical of vampires who ocassionally kill humans, as all the Cullens have.  And the Cullens all kill vampires, which isn't exactly the same thing.  I guess you could say they don't believe in preserving formerly human life.  The Cullens are also good friends with vampires which kill humans, and even accomodate them finding places [out of state] for them to kill humans.  So, you could say, even this line conflicts with itself. As the conclusion to the series, you expect some central lesson or theme to arise, now that you understand the big picture, and this one line is all I got out of it.<br /><br />Let me explain. Breaking Dawn is a bad book.<br /><br />Why is it a bad book? Breaking Dawn is egregiously written [SM pulled out the thesaurus at least twice in this book] as any I have ever read.  The plot was unfocused and didn't make sense, the writing was bad, much of the content was ridiculous, and the final conflict really was just 'the fear of a possible conflict.'  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  I haven't even had a chance to think about it for long...<br /><br />Plot-wise, BD is a mess.  First there is the wedding, and the masochistic honeymoon, and the monster baby...  Wait, monster baby?  Oh, and yes, Bella thinks that this baby is important, because she has seen some sort of creepy vision.  And we all know how Bella feels about her creepy visions!  I mean, if you are going to have a creepy vision, it must mean that you should dictate your future plans by it, right?  And EVERYONE AGREES or CONCEDES! The baby is sooo important, even though it would kill her to have it, but that is only because death is no real obstacle, due to vampirism.<br /><br />Nice.  Sweet.  Creepilicious.<br /><br />Then, SM breaks one huge can of STUPID on all our heads.<br /><br />Here is a list of stupid...<br />- vampires have more gene pairs than humans<br />- werewolves have more gene pairs than humans but less than vampires<br />- werewolves are different than shapeshifters<br />- Bella drinks blood that doesn't clot from a bendy straw<br />- a doctor discussed 'heating' the blood up for Bella<br />- Bella can't 'absorb' an IV<br />- vampire babies can't suck blood up from the placenta, they want it digested by the mother, turned into iron, and circulated through her blood?<br />- perhaps vampire babies think it is funny to have their human mothers drink blood<br />- the human Bella likes the taste of blood, thinks its yummy<br />- you really don't have to blood type blood that you eat, come on<br />- Jacob still gets to keep Bella warm (they don't own an electric blanket)<br />- all vampires have UNIQUE special powers, yet a certain group of them are called 'shields' even though their powers are hardly similar (defensive powers are quite different)<br />- why not call vampires with offensive powers 'swords' and with strictly informational powers 'brains?'<br />- Edward is willing to have Jacob sleep with his wife<br />- Renesme is the name of the baby ('nuff said)<br />- Nessie (where did they come up with THAT nickname?)<br />- Renesme is too lazy to talk, so she shows people visions<br />- Alice would rather walk under water to get to South America than to take a plane<br />- It takes a little over a month to fly to Forks from Italy<br />- the vampiric government easily over reacts, and likes to send a good show of force<br />- vampires send armies to ascertain the facts<br /><br />I could go on but I really hated this book.  If SM ever had a good idea, she ripped it to a million pieces and burned it.<br /><br />\\"We did not hope for the same things, but we all hoped.\\"<br /><br />This line ended chapter 32.  What does it mean?  Doesn't it apply to any group of sentient beings?  I mean, even kimono dragons have been shown to have future expectations, and are capable of planning.  That is certainly a basic definition of hope.  Even lizards hope and plan for a future tasty meal.  Even severely depressed people usually have SOME hope.  Who doesn't hope for something?  What an irrelevant and innocuous observation to make to conclude a chapter.<br /><br />If you find the above sentence fraught with meaning, then please, buy this book.  That is the only way you will like it.f sentient beings?  I mean, even kimono dragons have been shown to have future expectations, and are capable of planning.

1416550542|5.0|I can't tell you how pleased I was that Kate Morton's second novel, \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" was a vine selection. I had read her first book \\"The House at Riverton\\" through vine also and liked it so much that I was determined to read the next book. This way I got it early and for free!    Like her first novel Morton's new work is concerned with family secrets-in this case, secrets so huge they span multiple generations and more than a hundred years. It's almost like a fairy-tale in writing style, which jumps around in a hundred year or so time frame, telling the story as it happens and as it was discovered by those it affected most.    In 1913 a little girl was put on a boat to Australia by a woman she knew as the Authoress and told not to tell anyone her name. She waited and waited by ultimately the boat sailed without the woman coming back. Luckily in Australia the girl was taken home by the dock master and his wife-who want children and have none, named Nell and until her 21 birthday she is raised by them with no idea of her real origins. And then she is told.     In 2005 Nell dies, leaving her granddaughter Cassandra with some puzzling quotes and a house in Cornwall. After finding out about Nell's murky past Cassandra heads to England to untangle the mystery.     Though they only have a child's suitcase, a book of fairy tales and a walled cottage high upon a sea cliff with a magical hidden garden as clues we watch as thirty years apart Nell and Cassandra seek to put the puzzle together with help from local gossip about the woman who lived in the cottage and the family of the estate it b belonged too. At the same time the drama is played out in the past. Created with the best of intentions a web of secrets is spun so as not to be fully unraveled for almost a hundred years...    As is only appropriate, there is something of a fairy-tale about this novel. We have all the classic characters though their titles may be different-the wicked stepmother, kind fairy queen,handsome prince, man caught in the grip of an evil spell.....    Unlike the previous book this novel is written entirely in third person. Considering the intensely person nature of the drama within I would have expected a little bit of emotion to be lost in the writing but Morton really pulled it off. This book has more than its fair share of tear jerking moments. But by far the most impressive thing about this novel is the way the timeline spins around the reader-giving us just enough information in any one era to be fascinated and want to known more, with out ever becoming irritating (even though two chapters running are hardly ever set in the same decade.)     This is an amazing book and it fully establishes Kate Morton as an author who's every book I will read. This novel not only shows an incredible talent for writing, but for organization, considering the jumping timeline.    Five stars.

B000000OTU|4.0|Big Ones by Aerosmith is a greatest hits album, this cd does not span the bands entire career of songs, just the ones from the '80s and early '90s. My fave song from this collection is Janie's Got A Gun, Steven Tyler's voice is so powerful and cool. Crazy, Love in an Elevator, Dude Looks Like a Lady, Cryin', Livin' on the Edge, and Amazin' are some of the best tracks here. Not a complete collection but good enough.

B00136Q6DA|5.0|From the first time I heard \\"Love Song\\", I knew Sara Bareilles was just the kind of singer for whom I'd been searching.  It seems like so much female talent is wasted to vapid and manufactured pop music that I'd almost given up on female singers entirely.  I was overjoyed when I discovered KT Tunstall and wasn't sure I'd find anyone else I'd like as well.  I'm glad that Sara Bareilles proved me wrong.    Perhaps one of her best attributes is that she has a very powerful, lovely voice but she uses it with restraint.  She does cut loose on some of her songs (Vegas comes to mind here) but she does so in a classic tradition of a diva belting it out rather than a pop princess delving into the realm of the shriek.  I'm very pleased to say that there is never any shrieking in this album, just a pure and velvety voice.    Couple this with the cleverness of Bareilles's lyrics and it's easy to see why she's such a winning combination.  Some of her songs are plaintive and lovely, such as One Sweet Love, while others speak frankly of the travails of love, such as Fairytale.  Bareilles comes across as wry and savvy and while she isn't shy about being blunt, she never sounds bitter to me.  Instead, she sounds like a woman who has gained a bit of wisdom or two and who wryly injects pearls of that wisdom into her work.    Bareilles is a woman of serious talent and I hope fervently that she'll continue to produce albums of the quality of Little Voice.  I know I'll be anxiously awaiting them.
0143038419|5.0|I think that this was an abolutely beautiful book. It's about one woman's SELF-discovery, so of course it's all about her! But she's a woman that you can relate to. I completely understood her wanting to learn to speak Italian just because she wanted to, and learning how to relax and become content with yourself. In Bali, I felt her fear of getting involved with men again and thereby risking her newfound freedom and happiness. While there is an awful lot of religious and spiritual discusson in this book, it is not preachy. It's just interesting, and sometimes funny.<br /><br />This book makes me desperately want to go to Italy, Bali, anywhere, just to get a taste of the bliss and peace of mind that she has found.
B000059T1G|4.0|This is the one item from the Traffic collection that I never had. And since I have most of the other Traffic works (from Mr. Fantasy all the way to When The Eagle Flies), I decided to add it to the collection. I had heard it before back in my college days, but had forgotten how good it was. Typical Traffic sound while Dave Mason was with the band, but you can hear the beginnings of what was to come with John Barleycorn. Not too many tracks, but what is offered is top quality. And now my Traffic collection is complete.
1594489505|1.0|I thought this was one of the most remorselessly depressing books I've read.

031606792X|1.0|WTF? (Some spoilers)    After devouring & loving the first three Twilight novels, I started Breaking Dawn and ended up just skimming most of it. WTF? It reminded me of the last episode of Seinfeld. For those of you too young to remember, Seinfeld was a hilarious sitcom that was the funniest thing on TV for about 10 years. When the final episode aired, it was so bad, so long, and so unfunny. It made the characters seem like whiney, obnoxious, self-centered, unfunny people, and, by doing so, made those of us who loved the show feel like we were wrong all along about loving the show. How could we like such crap? Breaking Dawn is the final episode of Seinfeld for Twilight. Stephanie Meyers jumped the shark.    Not only is Bella extremely whiney (whole series should have been narrated by Edward or Jacob), but as a mother, I'm very upset about the honeymoon and pregnancy. Ignoring all that alien creature birth crap, but having Bella end up bruised and beaten after her sexual experience and that's okay?? And that she's having a baby that's literally killing her? That's okay and her martyrdom is good? And the faint whiff of pedophilia in Jacob imprinting the monster baby? I won't get into all the spoilers about all the other things wrong with this book, but I strongly urge anyone reading this review: don't read Breaking Dawn. Not worth it, unless you need a reason to hurl a book across a room.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I have never seen Pinocchio before, and I have a 2 year old son. So I bought the movie and popped it in before his bed time, and he sat like an angel and watched the whole movie! I enjoyed it also. It was very touching, especially since I have a son! . PLEASE see this movie by yourself or with the children.

B001KZVQJI|5.0|Definitely, the blu-ray version of this film just rocks your home.  The upgraded DTS-MA sound tracks have immense impact with a top flight system and at least one killer sub.  Beware, though, that your sub will blow dust off everything in the home.  And be sure to check your home owners insurance before turning it all up.  Your foundation just may move a few inches.     Video is superb as well if you are using a top notch blu-ray player, plasma and cabling.      Definitely, a reference quality disc for you to show off to your friends.
0545128285|5.0|My son is 40 years old and a faithful Harry Potter fan just like myself at 67. I didn't realize this book was written for children when I ordered it but gave it to my son on his birthday anyway.  Though the stories ARE for children but the commentary by Dumbledore at the end of each story makes it more enjoyable for any age. I have to say he still enjoyed the book very much.  He is looking forward to reading it to his 7 year old nephew.  So even though you are an adult and realize it is an upper children's reading level, buy it anyway.  If you are a Harry Potter fan you will enjoy it.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|This movie did have some beautiful scenery but it was tarnished by some really shoddy computer effects (ie. the stampede scene was TERRIBLE.) My 8 year old nephew was the first of the family to start announcing how fake it looked. The movie was fairly long, which is not always a bad thing, but I kept waiting for Australia to end. In fact I thought it was ending 3 or 4 times before it did. Yes ladies you can watch Mr. Jackman show his pecs through tight shirts, but that doesn't make it a great story. Being a movie based in Australia and not really knowing anything about it otherwise, I was disappointed that Kidman's character did not utilize her natural speech. Another annoying factor was it didn't seem to explain a fairly crucial part of the story, while it went on and on about others. I mean just how exactly did they make it out of the desert. I guess I missed something. The only thing that kept me watching the movie was that I really like Nullah's character. I would have enjoyed it more if the movie had less to do with high society and cows and more do with Nullah's eminent walkabout.

It's not a hard workout, and there's too much non-workout related material and talking to sit through. For example she says: \\"If you have to go to the lou, pause me, don't make me work-out alone,\\" then a couple minutes later she runs off the set to use the \\"lou\\".

B0014GJ08W|5.0|I loved this one as soon as I saw her short PR piece on TV. It wasn't easy to get, but it is totally worth the trouble. What a rich voice she has and she has total control of it. Singing two languages in the same song isn't done very often. She does it so well. Her style is energetic, passionate, feminine and sexy. I highly reccommend it to anyone who enjoys a little something different in entertainment.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|I was excited to get this video and somewhat disappointed in the first half of the movie. I blame it on poor direction as it seemed as if the director did not know if he wanted a campy comedy or a drama as evidenced by the odd over-acting done by Nicole Kidman in the first half of the film. Hugh Jackman was steady throughout and made the film more believeable. And the photography will make you want to travel to Australia! Despite the shaky beginning, I recommend that you persevere to the second half as that is where the film takes on the courage and beauty of the story as well as of the acting. If only it had been that good throughout!
B001K3JF7K|1.0|I have purchased every Diana Krall cd and am a huge fan.  I found this album her worst.  The cd is like one long, self indulgent, breathy, bad imitation of Shirley Horn.  Krall needs to go back to her first cd and listen to her voice and keyboards as compared to this latest disaster.
B0000DZTIL|3.0|the movie looks good but it lacks a better definition than other movies from its time and the wide screen format is very thik in the top and bottom margins so it makes the movie to look smaller...any way its a good movie ...i enjoyed.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is definitely one of the most relaxing albums to listen to.  It's one of those albums that I like to play late at night, and enjoy the 1950s style atmosphere.  When several people have commented on how it was influential for modal jazz, that's the least of it.<br /><br />One of the things that I love about jazz is listen to musicians have conversations and discussions, not of words, but of emotions.  Jazz jams are always such an intimate experience that non-musicians can never understand.  However, a lot of them really enjoy listening to these jams.  For some of the more uptempo jazz, not on this album, they might get up and dance.  For the stuff you'll hear on this album, you'll definitely want to relax.<br /><br />This was in between the so-called great quintets.  It was right after the first, so he had several musicians from that band on this album.  Another comment that I should make is that except for \\"Flamenco Sketches,\\" each track was done in the first take.  I personally think that it's always good that way because even if they're not polished, they're usually more into it.<br /><br />This is definitely one of my favorite jazz albums ever recorded, and there's a reason that it's considered as great an album as it is.
B0000039QA|4.0|Unlike a lot of other reviewers on this site i'm not going to waste time by comparing this to 2pac's 'All Eyez On Me' album as a lot of people like to do. Instead i'm going to review this album on its own merits.    I think this album is a good follow up to the excellent (and close to flawless) 'Ready To Die' but Life After Death does have a couple of minor complaints. I don't know about others but I don't want to hear Puff Daddy/P. Diddy on every damn track, occassionally i can tolerate but when he is on at least 75% of the CD there's a serious problem. A lot of songs have long intro's which whilst i agree some are necessary I wouldn't say they are all needed.      The album certainly has some great tracks like: Somebody's Gotta Die, Hypnotize, Kick In The Door, What's Beef?, N****s Bleed, I Got A Story To Tell (This one really highlights Biggie's unique ability to tell a story masterfully with rhymes), Miss U, Going Back To Cali, Ten Crack Commandments, Sky's The Limit, Mo' Money Mo' Problems, Long Kiss Goodnight and You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You). As I say there are plenty of great tracks on here.    The tracks I wasn't feeling include: +@!* you Tonight, Playa Hater (Biggie sings on this one, I don't personally like this one but others say it's a guilty pleasure) and The World Is Filled.    Overall I would suggest you buy this album, not a classic as some suggest but a good follow up. Make's you wonder how much the industry misses guy's like Notorious (and 2pac) and what it would be like had both or at the very least one of them had lived. Buy this considering that this is the last you're ever going to hear from the great lyricist that is The Notorious B.I.G! Live on.

1416914307|4.0|This was an epic ending to a pretty good series.     Overall, I had found the first two books (City of Bones and City of Ashes) to be all right, and didn't expect great things out of the third and final installment.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  All questions are answered in very creative and unique ways, there are epic battles, and the hot romance we were all hoping for.  It was a perfect wrap up for a very unique story and by far the best book of the series.      If you have read the first two, I highly recommend you read the third.  Even if you didn't like them, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised.
1439102813|5.0|This is an incredible undertaking, a book about a 50 year old linguistic psychology professor from Harvard who starts a slow descent into early-onset Alzheimer's disease. In her community -- where intelligence is the highest valued commodity -- she is ostracized with a scarlet \\"A\\" and must decide the ultimate question -- is life worth it?  Or not?<br /><br />She asks herself:  \\"What if I wake up and don't know who my husband is?  What if I don't know where I am or recognize myself in the mirror?  When will I no longer be me?  Is my soul and spirit immune to the ravages of Altzheimer's?\\"<br /><br />There are searing scenes that will remain with me for a long, long time: when Alice forgets how to make her favorite pudding Christmas recipe.  When she confuses the black rug near her door for a gaping hole that will swallow her up.  When she attends a Harvard symposium and asks a piercing question -- one that earns her admiration -- and then asks the same question a few minutes later, not understanding why others aren't impressed.  When she becomes inconsolable because she thinks her sister -- who was killed much earlier in a car accident -- has just died.<br /><br />And then there's the moment that hits the reader in the gut:  Alice programs in her Blackberry five simple questions (What month is it?  Where do you live?  Where is your office?  When is your daughter's birthday?  How many children do you have?\\") She consistently answers these questions each day until one day...when she can't.<br /><br />I recommend this highly for anyone who has ever known anyone with Altzheimer's...and for anyone who hasn't.  It's a probing look at what it means to be human.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Amazing that I liked it. I don't do horror. The best zombies ever were in the Michael Jackson video Thriller. I should say I like vampires and werewolves and licans, etc, but Night of the Living Dead was scary. My son walked away from this movie on TV, left it on, I happened along and sat down and started laughing. So I recorded it and watched it the next night with my husband and daughter. Both of them hated it, and I loved it. Like the other reviewer said, it's intellectual humour. Amazing. I'm going to rent it without commercials and the hack job Comedy Central did on it and try it again. I told my family, when you take out the non-scary zombies, it's just a story about a guy and his friends/girlfriend. That's what I liked about it.

B0015OKWL2|5.0|Two detectives have partnered for nearly 30 years in New York City.  You would think that they are ready for retirement;  but, before they can put in thier paperwork something happens that ties a recent murder to a case they had solved years ago.  You will be completely suprised as the film progresses and you get the low down on these two men: Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino play the detectives.  So pop some popcorn, grab a soft drink and be prepared to be bambozzled as the story comes to a surprising end.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I LOVE this album.  It brings back all of the great memories of the past - high school & college years. There's no current music that comes close to the sound of Frankie  & the Four Seasons.  It's real Sing-A-Long music.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|The James Bond character brings another 007 thriller to the screen.  You know he is going to win;  but, getting there is half the fun.  A ruthless tycon wants to disestablish the world's economy to bring the opposing superpowers to their knees so that he can make money.  James Bond steps in to prevent WW III from breaking out.  Of course, you have to have the beautiful women populating the film too;  they add to the great color and variety of the background.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith Urban has trully blessed the music world with this new AMAZING album. Its almost like you are listening to a love fairytale from the beginning to end. The songs start with finding new love and each song describes a new step in a relationship. Its such a raw and honest album. Makes your heart feel alive and ready to give love away. The world is better place with this cd in it. Its one of those cds you could hear over and over and not get tired of it. There's not a single song in the track list that I don't absolutely love. Not to mention the awesome lyrics and the amazing guitar solos you'll hear. When Summmer Comes Around has guitar riffs that will give you goosebumps and make the hair on your neck standup. I highly recommend this album, you won't be dissappointed.

160459201X|5.0|In the past 3 years I have purchased more then 50 books dealing with the Law of Attraction and the conscious/subconscious mind.  This book, by far, is the single most important book that I have ever purchased.  I can't put it down...it's amazing!  It is easy to read, and if you can get past errors in grammer, you'll love it!  I'm half way through in 2 nights!  This book gives you easy examples and techniques for changing your mind, and changing your life! It's there for every one of us!  Enjoy this great buy!!!
B000RMQH30|1.0|Clearly I'm alone on this Amazon forum in the opinion that this is by far his least interesting album, and I'm a BH completest. I even have his phenomenal 'Pleasure and Pain' acoustic album with Tom Freund (which songs later surfaced on 'Welcome..' ) I've enjoyed his sonic palate experimentation on 'Both Sides' and the eclectic nature of all of his albums, but this one is just a boring construction that sounds like a pale tribute to 'The Band'. Gone are the Biting Sardonic lyrics of the past, (only the first track even hints at the greatness that was 'Fight For Your Mind' or 'Don't Take That Attitude..' ) Gone are the Weissborn fireworks that were so unique to his sound, the solos are simplistic and boring. The lyrics are trite and unoriginal. Even his instrumental, 'Paris Sunrise 7' is by far his least interesting acoustic instrumental ever.  This album is like some irritating imitation of Neil Young and The Band with lyrics on par with a fifteen year old's love poems..'Needed you Tonight' has the most promise of rocking, until you realize the Black Crowes did this song 15 years ago.. 'Put it On Me' is another knockoff of 'Steal My Kisses' at a slightly faster tempo, and most of these songs sound like the slow dance songs at a 1995 high school prom. (Heart of Matters actually brings to mind 'Lights' by Journey)   Too Much Piano, Too Little Fire, No great guitar solos, quite disappointing and a MAJOR snoozer.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I have been using this model headphone easily 10 years. I tried 2 similar Sony sport models costing twice as much and the headbands broke within 1 week and no improvement in audio quality. The lightweight design allows for extended usage without ear fatigue or irritation to the outer ear.  In the summer while mowing the grass or bike riding sweat will clog the sound holes or cause an un-equalizing seal in the ear, must dry it off and move on!  As far as durability I agree with James a good pair could last nearly a year but 2 or 3 months is more realistic. I feel that there has been a decrease in quality over the years. But the $9.99 price makes these headphones a disposable product! It would be nice if Sony would fix this problem. After my experience with a Sony MD player these headphones are the only Sony product that I will buy. For more critical listening try Yamaha RH5MA Headphones $59.99.
B001N26GFC|1.0|I bought this based on criteria of other viewers.  Wow what a disappointment. Boring British and a waste of good money.  If you are thinking about buying this suggest you rent it first.

B00005R24K|5.0|One of the greatest horror films of all time just gets better as you watch it. This movie is loved by all. It is a classic.
B001EYGOEM|1.0|Terrible bubblegum pop.  If there is a country song on this album I don't know what it is. Not only that, her producer is obviously using pitch correcting software in the studio as she cannot carry a tune live. If you want to listen to good country music, search elsewhere.
B000UR9QGW|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time just got better on Blu-ray. The quality is great. It has tons of features and extras that will keep you hooked for a month or so. I highly recommend this product.
B001NW8D7G|5.0|I have started collecting 180 gram vinyl, and am non plussed with a lot of releases- a lot of minor defects with a pop here and a crackle there, maybe a slight warp and nothing you can do about it....which is disheartening when paying the high cost.  All Rhino releases I have purchased have wowed me  flawless vinyl pressing- not a sound besides the music...cant even tell the record is playing between tracks on this release  I can hear sounds that I never heard before  One of my top five albums ever
B001P9KR8U|1.0|The main characters undergo a horrible series of events, many of which seem added simply to agitate the audience. Did they sit down and brainstorm despicable acts to include in the movie?     The actors cannot act, starting with the lead male role, and including his male friend and his the main girl, plus so many others I can't list without spoiling the film. I can't even recall any instances of solid acting.    The romance is forced. The action is forced. The whole movie is forced.     Don't see it.
0064430227|5.0|As a child, I loved HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON.  I reconnected with this story when I became a mom, and received a copy from my aunt to share with my daughter.  Even after all these years, the lessons of HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON are fresh and true.  This is a classic that I am thrilled to be able to share with my wee one.<br /><br />Harold is gifted with a big, bold, and beautiful imagination.  The drawings he creates with his favorite purple crayon take him wherever he wants to go, wherever he can dream.  What a fantastic lesson for anyone.  If you are looking for adventure, you need look no further than your imagination...and your trusty purple crayon.<br /><br />The illustrations for HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON are ingenious and very simple - basic line drawings, in the color purple.  They look like the drawings of a young child, and the single color palate forces you to look at the details Harold is drawing, not the colors.<br /><br />My nearly 4 year old daughter loves hearing HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON at bedtime.  It really sparks her imagination and gets her thinking and dreaming, and I can see the wheels turning as she falls a sleep.  My little one has a very vivid imagination anyway; HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON just reminds her that her imagination is all she really needs.  Along, of course, with her purple crayon.
B0007DFJ0G|3.0|I read somewhere that if you are an anarchist, you will love this film.  And?  So what if you're not an anarchist?  What if you're squeamish about physical violence (like me), and repulsed by over-hyped, overly dark, overly acted future \\"cult\\" films?  I guess that leaves pretentious metro-sexual artistes, brilliant anti-social aspiring Bernie Madoffs, and worshippers of Brad Pitt (and oh those pecs!).  Fight Club will make you think though, if you don't get too grossed out to think.  But seriously, do you really need to see people get the crap beat out of them to start having serious thoughts about your life?  Hell, you can see that for free on youtube.  Or just go to any \\"real fighting videos\\" website.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Maybe I just prefer a good old fashioned Bond film with some style and ahem, good looking women as opposed to..well.  Oh, and the attempts at humor here really fall short.  Other than that General, how was the siege of Moscow?
B001PPGAIK|5.0|I found the movie very well done, and a wonderful story.  Not only was it a well done \\"story\\", but I learned a lot re: the aboriginal people, and even though I was only 7 years old at the time of the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor, I did not know that they had attacked Australia as well.  As a movie lover, I will definitely watch this one more than once.

044024367X|1.0|If you enjoy reading a novel where all the adjectives are \\"dingy, dirty, greasy, sandy, dull and dun-colored\\" and if you enjoy reading a novel where nothing happens and no characters develop, this is the book for you.  The author phoned it in - knowing that he has a built-in audience that expects a book a year.  I've always liked the hero, Reacher.  Not enough to be bored to pieces.  I am very sorry to have wasted my money.  Please don't waste yours, too.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Not sure if it's apparent, but Diana Krall definitely works her blond mane on many of her (better) album covers.  I always thought it was a quick attention grabber, but now I know: a strange set of syllogistic rules apply to the music industry, so it should come as no surprise that good hair increases the probability of a good recording.<br /><br />The people who brought you Quiet Nights skimmed on the hair stylist, and now we, the listeners have to pay.<br /><br />Listening to Krall attempt to capture the indolent, fragile, enervated voice with which Astrud Gilberto (whom many of these songs presented here have come to be associated with) made her unforgettable imprint in bossa nova is as painful as listening to Sting trying to stretch a vowel in a Dowland or an English Tudor classic like it was an economic stimulus check.  The enchantment of Gilberto comes from the beaches of Rio, the certain sadness that comes at the end of a samba at Carnaval- when dancers have to return to the favelas, the dreams of cachaca, and the discrete charm of the wife singing leisurely in the kitchen when Stan Getz first heard her (and decided to use her on The Girl From Ipanema).<br /><br />Krall's super high definition recording, on the other hand, is like all the gloss of a fancy stereo set...with Kenny G cued on the cd player: you can hear all the breathy nuances and inflections of her singing...but there's no backbone, no historical justification for the inertia in her voice, no emotional undertone to it. Unless you needed Ambien after a drugstore has closed, but Amazon mp3 was still open for a download.<br /><br />In the present culture of recycling, the only saving grace from vacuous remakes of classics is a profound new insight in a contemporary reading (think the exiting line of Pet Shop Boys' extended version of Willie Nelson's \\"Always On My Mind\\" - \\"maybe I didn't love you.\\"), to simply do something that's already been done before is purely ego needing to be stroked with the aid of modern electronics.<br /><br />Anyway...my theory is that Krall's hairstylist went to work for Eliane Elias.  Check out the cover for Elias's 2009 Bossa Nova Stories.  Better hair = better renditions.<br /><br />So better hair will lead to better covers.  Unless remake-happy musicians want to start re-making Midnight Oil's discography, let this be a lesson.  If you don't like what you see in the mirror when you wake up in the morning, avoid the hairclip, stay away from the scrunchie.<br /><br />Delay going to the recording studio one more day!Anyway...my theory is that Krall's hairstylist went to work for Eliane Elias.

1576754227|1.0|I've been desperate for solutions to procrastination and I ordered this book simply because there are many sold with a good average rating.  However, what a disappointment!  I only wish I had taken the time to read a few of the negative reviews too, because as soon as I did, I found one that would have saved me time/money.  Like I said, I was desperate.    Anyway, I honestly made it to page 32 (only because there is very little on each page) and then had to quit because I felt like I was reading the work of an elementary student, and if anything, this book would only hurt me if I should happen to remember any of it's contents.    I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE!  However, if you're reading this and still aren't convinced, I'll give you mine.  Honestly, I would, but you'd have to figure a way to contact me and pay for shipping.    WHAT WOULD I RECOMMEND?  If you're like me, and really struggling with procrastination issues, then I'd suggest reading the following:    -A GUIDE TO RATIONAL LIVING by Albert Ellis and Robert Harper - this is the best book I own; it will help with anything because it basically gives you a new strategy/philosophy for life, period; it will teach you to understand yourself/others better with a new/complete understanding to perception/interpretation/reaction.    -Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management by Mark Foster - I just got this book in the mail today and I am 17 pages in, but I can already tell that it's got great potential, and I completely agree with everything I've read so far pertaining to how we actually function and why we procrastinate.  So, from this, I can see that this guy will more than likely have great solutions since unlikely many, he understands the problem!    -The Now Habit by Neil Fiore - pretty solid overall; will give you insight to understanding what procrastination really is and some unique strategies for beating it; though the case histories sound made-up and very dry.
B0000047CW|3.0|3 1/2    Relaxed classic known for being the first full-fledged American bossa nova record is not exactly gripping, but still tightly chill enough to constitute compositional significance, with the Getz/Byrd dynamic lending to some interesting synergy. Not quite the landmark of next years Gilberto collaboration, but completely important in its own right.
B0002IQEHI|4.0|I received this dvd and was disappointed that it only went to scene 32.  When I emailed the seller, they immediately offered a prepaid return and sent me another dvd.  They never received my return in the mail, but sent a replacement anyway.  The new DVD, brand new and in the wrapper, also only went to scene 32.  While I am very satisfied with the response of the seller and rate them a 5/5 stars, I think I will write to the company, warnervideo, and ask them to replace the DVD.
0307277453|5.0|What a good book. This guy makes science come alive. It's a great read and it's easy to follow even for guys that got C's in high school biology. If you had any doubt that we are decedent from the fungus beneath your nails read this. Makes a great gift for your creationist friends.
B001TH16DI|2.0|This is one of the reasons why Blu-ray still needs the compatition such as HD-DVD.  They can come out with just the garbage they want, to buy again & again.  They are not forced to come out with a better product.  Yes, these are all great movies, that deserve a better restoration.  They won't though, & when the Star Trek 11 comes out on Blu-ray in 6 months, there will be another version of these movies.  Blu-ray is beginning to suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000068OCS|5.0|I've had the VCR tape of this movie for many years and finally had to toss it and replace it with the DVD. Koyaanisqatsi is a unique and mystical journey for mythological man.  It bogs down in a couple of places, but what DVD does not?  The story is exciting and depressing, thrilling and melancholy, inspiring and introspective.
3836503050|5.0|As a photographer and artist, I whole-heartedly agree on the comments of the previous reviewers of this excellent book.  Gil Elvgren's cheesecake paintings cannot be matched even by today's standards.  They inspire, but cannot be imitated.  The reason why I bought this particular edition is that I wore out my softcover version of this book.  To fully enjoy Elvgren's work, it must be in hardcover, and in this large format.  It should be noted, that this is the second printing of this book in hardcover.  The first edition is a sought after collector's item, and later editions were printed in smaller formats and in paperback.  So if you are a fan of Elvgren, or just discovered this master, get this book while you can!
0930289234|4.0|I enjoy Watchmen. The story is interesting and unique, and for the first half at least aims to endure. Ultimately though it does become rather pretentious and begins to stumble about 75% of the way through. Luckily, it does save itself with a solid ending. I gave it a 4/5 rating, but would have given it a 3.5 if the option was available to do so.<br /><br />All in all, a very good story with a couple trips, but not the be-all graphic novel that it's played out to be.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've had a hard time finding an exercise DVD because I am extremely uncoordinated. I can't handle the choreography in most workouts, but this workout is perfect! I'm in decent shape (good diet, walk a lot) but I don't really ever exercise on purpose. I am on day 3 and I've been sore since the morning I woke up after the first day, but I can get through the workout (I'll be at level 1 for a while) without giving up due to stepping on my own feet.    I live in a tiny studio apartment (I have about 6 square feet to do my workout in when I push my coffee table out of the way) and I like to go to work early. This workout fits into my morning routine and my tiny space.    Overall, I'm really pleased and would recommend it to any beginner who feels intimidated by the fancy moves in other DVDs.

B001M5UDGS|4.0|I had seen the first episode of this on the web and I was enthralled. The subtle humor and my favorite subject (evil villians) made it worthwhile to purchase, but now my teenager won't let go of it. She has it in her room and I haven't seen it for 3 weeks. No, I will not go up in a teenager's room, I don't know what kind of horrible monsters lurk under the strewn clothing and empty chips bags. You go up there, and we'll watch it here in the sanctity of my entertainment room.

B000001FS6|4.0|I have had this album for years on vinyl, and like many of the songs on it. However, I never really liked the album in the way that I like so many other U2 albums. The other day I saw a cd in a bargain bin and figured it would be good to pick this up, as I've been listening to a lot of U2 lately. Looking at the titles, I kept thinking that if I rearranged them, it might be a much more enjoyable listening experience. So I got it home, programmed up the cd, and played it. It was great! I noticed during this process that R/H was produced by Jimmy Iovine, not by Lanois and Eno. Mystery solved, eh? Iovine is probably a great guy to have on your side in the music business, but he really dropped the ball here as producer: Helter Skelter as a leadoff song? That's nuts. Van Dieman's Land cutting off before the end? Ummm, I really want to be nice here, but hey, at least let Edge finish his song, dude. And don't put it as the second song on the cd unless you put the whole thing on there, either! So, it's like this: Take the studio cuts, put them up front, in whatever order you want. Then put the live cuts later, and Presto: Great cd! If you want to make it better, burn some of the songs from the dvd release that are not on the album. Also, some of the b-sides from the singles of the era would be a fine addition. Finally, get a version of Van Diemen's Land which does not fade out, and use that on there too. Now what you have is a recipe for a double cd, or ipod sequence. Lastly, if you get your band signed to a label, and you move out to California, do not have Jimmy Iovine produce your cd, unless, of course you happen to agree with all of his ideas.
B0010358CG|5.0|what can i say on blue ray this is a stunning work with high quality animation and a splendid story that continues the Appleseed franchise very well only problem is with some of the voice actors but that's standard for anime in general, if curious this was viewed on a PS3 connected via HDMI cables to a HDTV. So i did enjoy it to the fullest.

B001PR0Y4Y|5.0|This is a gut-wrenchingly honest movie about growing up in tough family circumstances.  It's not a pretty place, but for the two lost souls tossed about in this storm, there is a ray of hope...  It left me shaking, emotionally, in a way that movies rarely do.  The moments of tenderness and comedy diffused the tension.  I loved it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Even if you've seen it for free already, this DVD is worth buying. The musical commentary track is almost as good as the show itself, even (and perhaps especially) if you don't like commentary tracks. It's really a fantastic package at a good price.

1400064627|4.0|Our book club suggested reading Fried Green Tomatoes. I read it years ago, saw the movie and thought I don't want to reread this. Wrong thought. The book was great. It is one of those I can read it all in one day. It jumped back from the present to the past. You felt like you were actually there.<br /><br />It brought up allot of things about the old south with the clan, people's opinions of black people and what allot of people thought about blacks.....as who cares what color they are, they are people just like you and me. It was a good representation of what the TRUE south was really like.<br /><br />Enjoyed reading the book. Everyone in the book club will be coming to the house on Tuesday where we will not only discuss the book but enjoy the delicious recipes that are in the back. We will then watch the movie and discuss the differences between the book and the movie. Sounds like a fun day,

B001SN78JO|3.0|When Carl's (Jim Carrey) marriage fell apart, so did his life.  Even though it's been two years, he still can't move on.  So he sits at home and avoids his friends.  Not that Peter (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson) let him drop out of life completely.  Carl works at a bank where he denies every loan that comes across his desk.<br /><br />Things changes dramatically when he decides to attend a conference run by Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp).  Singled out of the crowd, Carl is put on the spot and agrees to a new contract with himself, to say \\"Yes\\" to everything that comes his way.<br /><br />And almost immediately it begins working for him as he meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel).  The two begin a romance very quickly.  But can Carl continue his winning streak by saying \\"Yes\\" to everything?<br /><br />This is the part where I condemn the movie with faint praise.<br /><br />Billed as a comedy, there were several laugh out loud moments.  Emphasis on the several.  I was ready to laugh hard at the entire movie, and that just didn't happen.<br /><br />On the whole, the movie is pretty predictable.  That was one reason I didn't find it as funny as I expected to.  I saw most of the jokes coming long before the punch line.  Likewise, all but a couple of the plot points were overly familiar.<br /><br />On the other hand, I found the story enjoyable.  I identified with Carl a little too much, so I was rooting for him to get out of his rut and enjoy life again.  Heck, it even made me rethink how I am living my life.  Pretty head stuff from a comedy.  And the great acting from everyone in the cast made it easy to like the characters.<br /><br />Since the movie is rated PG-13, I expected the language and sexual nature of some of the jokes.  But there were a couple in particular that I found out of line and squirm inducing.<br /><br />So the problem with the movie really comes down to the writing.  I really do think there was promise in the premise for some genuine comedy, but it never developed into what it could have been.  This is a definite rent before you buy.is a definite rent before you buy.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|I have been listening to Diana Krall for at least six years now and am particularly fond of her jazzier outings, most notably All for You which was the first one I picked up and still receives regular play in my high end stereo system.  I pre-ordered this CD with high hopes but find myself deeply disappointed.  While the sound quality of Quiet Nights is excellent I find the music, arrangements, and vocal performance all to be bland and uninspired.  As a fan I can only hope that this is the temporary result of having twin two-year-olds.  I've listened to the CD three times and I'm not sure there will be a fourth.  Judging from my own intentions and the other reviews here all interested parties will have no trouble finding an affordable used copy of this CD.  It's not entirely without redeeming merit - it makes fine background music and of course it could always be used as a reflector to keep birds out of one's garden.
1416511946|5.0|Put on your spandex, tease your hair big, and step back into the year 1987. Nikki Sixx, the creative pulse of Motley Crue, opens up his veins and his diary and invites you into the hell of his heroin addiction during Motley Crue's Girls, Girls, Girls tour.     The book is an intoxicating journey into Nikki's downward spiral with alcohol and drugs. Each entry takes us deeper and deeper into the depths of his reliance on drugs, his raging paranoia, and his inability to deal with people. Like his narcotic of choice, we travel deep into his veins getting closer and closer to understanding the pain his addiciton seeks to numb, but we crash along with him and awake feeling just a bit hung over. He injects and overdoses resurrecting not to find a renewed spirit to living, but achingly searching for another fix.    Nikki intoduces us to the unknown members of Guns'N Roses, takes us along with him on his drug escapes with Slash, and gives us his uncensored opinion of a serious, pompous, and pious Axl Rose. It suits Axl that his ego proceeded him making a name for himself.     Nikki also whispers in our ear his close relationship with Tommy Lee, who even in his whacked-out state of mind, still comes across as one of the most loyal people in Nikki's life. The problem occurs when Nikki believes that Tommy can turn his addiction on and off, while Nikke feels forced to hide in his bedroom closet sticking a needle into his scrotum because he's run out of veins.    This is required reading not only for Motley Crue fans, but for anyone who's fantasized about a heavy metal rock lifestyle. Nikki does not  romanticize his role as a key player on the heavy metal scene; he exposes it for what it is--a bunch of guys who without music and a loyal fan base would just be heroin roadkill.
B00004RD54|5.0|If you think Lou's career is lacking irony in any way, you haven't been paying attention.  IRONY #1: The version of &#34;Sweet Jane&#34; on this album went into heavy rotation of FM radio, back in the day, largely due to the intro from Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, as well as their dueling solos throughout. Lou had nothing to do with that. Don't misunderstand me...this IS Lou's performance, and his alone, but the thing that put &#34;R&R Animal&#34; on the map was &#34;Sweet Jane,&#34; and the way this version got the nation's attention was through those two guitars, which had nothing to do with Lou. Later, starting with &#34;The Blue Mask,&#34; the late, great Robert Quine prodded Lou into picking up a guitar again, and to my ears, Lou going nuts in a guitar battle with Quine leaves &#34;Jane&#34; in the DUST.  IRONY #2: It is a well-documented fact that Lou's &#34;favorite&#34; version of &#34;Sweet Jane&#34; was the mournful, droning version served up by Cowboy Junkies.  IRONY #3: Lou's first solo album TANKED...people HATED it, called it a bunch of VU leftovers recorded with professional musicians who knew nothing about Lou OR his music (Elton John's guitarist Caleb Quaye plus Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman from Yes). David Bowie to the rescue...&#34;Transformer&#34; became Lou's first post-Velvets hit, but with &#34;Animal,&#34; he stepped out of Bowie's shadow IMMEDIATELY and put out this album, which beat Bowie at his own &#34;androgynous rock star&#34; game. I know Bowie fans are not going to like that remark. But to this DAY, Bowie's music pretty much appeals to Bowie fans, as sizable in number as they may be, but &#34;Animal&#34; still has a place in the hearts of pretty much anyone who owned an FM radio when it was released.  IRONY #4: Instead of using this as a springboard to something bigger, Lou immediately bit the hand that fed him, a la Neil Young's post-&#34;Harvest&#34; gambit fans now call the &#34;ditch trilogy.&#34; The result is that both artists have careers which spanned decades and will most likely continue to do so, whereas MANY artists who chased hits...if they were lucky...had a few, and now play at state fairs (if they're lucky).  Lou was a genius. I know, because he told us that on a regular basis. But seriously...he was a sly fox right up until the end, recording that album with Metallica that got SLAMMED on initial release and now is held in higher regard after a &#34;second look.&#34;  This album wasn't Lou's &#34;peak,&#34; it was just one more stop on the journey...but a 5-star stop, to be sure.

B00005YJMX|5.0|Herzog's remake of the F.W.Murnau masterpiece of 1922, is one of the most beautifully realized films on the vampire ever made. Alot of the film appears shot for shot, but Herzog adds his own touch to the proceedings that makes the images indelible. Herzog's film lacks the creepiness of the Murnau film and certainly Kinski can not frighten the same way that Max Schreck could in the silent original. This version brings more of a sense of pathos to the vampire and Kinski brings one of his most nuanced performances, so subtle and so menacing. The cast aids him well, especially Isabella Adjani who is gorgeous as Mina, the woman Nosferatu pines for and Bruno Ganz, whose transformation from meek Clerk to Vampire is downright chilling. The film is also aided immeasurably by a lush, classical film score that brings a sense of doom and epic quality to the gorgeous on location photography, several of which are similar to what Murnau had in his film.    There are two different versions of the film, one shot in German,the other in English. Many prefer the German, but I tend to enjoy them both for what they offer. Special Features include some SERIOUSLY creepy theatrical trailers and a behind the scenes feature with Herzog. There's also a commentary track on the German version provided by Herzog that is both informative and enlightening.    This is one splendid DVD set and highly reccomended for the Horror and Foreign film fan seeking out a more artistic fright film to review. A cinema essential along with it's illustrious original.

B001DTPZNY|4.0|I have been a life-long fan of the Indiana Jones films (I first saw \\"Raiders\\" when I was ten).    I really don't understand all the negative reviews heaped upon this flick. So many people balked at the \\"aliens\\" factor, but they seem to forget that the Indy movies (as well as the novels) always dealt with the occult and/or supernatural. Where else could the Indy saga go? How could the creators take it one step further? Well, how about the mystery of the so-called Roswell incident?    I thought the aliens mystery was the next logical step for Indy to try and tackle. Why not? When you consider the \\"ancient astronauts\\" theories that have been circulating for the past 40 years or so and how these theories tie in with archeology around the world, I found the latest Indy premise to make sense and found it interesting and exciting.    Another bone of contention seems to be the now-infamous \\"nuke the fridge\\" scene. Why do so many people have a problem with this? No one seemed to scream and holler when, in \\"Temple of Doom\\" during the mine car chase scene, the car that Indy and company were racing around in managed to jump a 100 foot gap in the track and still land safely and accurately on the other side just because they \\"ducked\\"?    That's what Indiana Jones films have always been about; escaping the inescapable. The original 3 films all had certain scenes that were kind of hard to swallow, but so what? It's an action/adventure film! You've got to suspend disbelief for the sake of a good story!    I found \\"Kingdom\\" to be everything that an Indy film should be; a great leading man, plenty of action, a healthy dose of comedy, exciting chases, great fight scenes and a terrific mystery to unravel. What else do you look for in an Indiana Jones film? \\"Kingdom\\" delivers all of that.    It's not my favorite Indy movie (that distinction is awarded to \\"Last Crusade\\" with \\"Raiders\\" only a hair's length behind it), but it IS an Indiana Jones film! My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed it and were glad to own it on DVD. I loved being able to share it with my kids who, since \\"Kingdom\\"'s release, have shown a tremendous interest in the original 3 films as well (which we have all watched an enjoyed together).    I especially loved the scene where the Russians' car crashes into the statue of Marcus Brody in the courtyard of Marshall College and the statue's head breaks off only to crash right into a Ruskie's stomach effectively removing him from the chase. What a wonderful, nostalgic touch and a wonderful homage to the late Denholm Elliot.    Relax and enjoy this movie. It's not meant to be anything more than it's predecessor films; high adventure escapism!    \\"It's not the years, honey. It's the mileage.\\"

B001P9KR8U|4.0|It's an amazing thing when you hear of a movie that has been hyped to death actually being worthy of the hoopla.  This is one of them, and quite an unlikely entry from Danny Boyle in that we see a simple love story.  Up till now, Mr. Boyle hasn't gone for the cheaply sentimental, and while there are plenty of opportunities to go in that direction with \\"Slumdog,\\" it never gets too treacly.    How he does that is the conceat of the storytelling.  Split between Jamal's gritty backstory of a childhood in the the slums of Mumbai is the glitzy tension of him compeating in the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\"  A rags to riches story this is, but Jamal has come up from the absolute bottom to the very top of winning it all, and stays basically a good guy motivated by the right things.  Namely the love of his life whom he's known since childhood.  Boyle takes an unflinching look at life in the slums of India's megacities, and this keeps us grounded.  The youngsters picked to play the characters as children have great heart, which can be pretty heartbraking when you see how they keep their innocence in such dark surroundings.  Some Indian citizens claim the depiction of Mumbai is too negative, but this can be a good thing in showing one's country as well.  After all, we can see the good touristy things in a travelogue.  We can experience a country by seeing all sides of it.    Boyle even throws an homage to the musical numbers common in the the Hindi/Marsala Bollywood productions in the end credits.  A simple trope which works wonders, capping an exuberant ending to a well-done film.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you are a fan of BBC television series on nature, such as the \\"Life of Birds\\" or \\"Life of Mammals\\", you will find the narration and overall style very familiar.  This series does evolve in some ways from those predecessors.  The footage is very clear, whethr on DVD or espescially Blu-ray.  They cover animals not covered in the previous series, but they also cover what I refer to as \\"Life of Earth\\" - the various biomes and features are startlingly captured.  David Attenborgough narrates again, but you never see him.  What you see is quite amazing.

1594201927|2.0|As a trader and history afficiando, I was really looking forward to reading this book however the title did not live up to my expectations.  I found the book's content disorganized and the writing style dull. While the book is unquestionably well-researched, it was boring to read.  Although it deals only with bubbles and not other topics like the bond market, I much prefered Edward Chancellor's \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\".  Those who had read this book when it debuted in 2000 would have recognized both the stock market and real estate bubbles. Compare the stars for Chancellor's book to Ferguson's. It's a hands down winner.  Also, if you're after financial history, you can't go wrong with any of Robert Sobel's books.
0307346617|4.0|When I first heard of this book I thought it sounded great.  I did not realize that the entire book was going to be made up of interview excerpts but once you get into it you can't put the book down.  There were several interviews that I was saying \\"No, you can't stop there.  I want to know what happened next.\\"  Brooks' interviews cover both the good and the bad of what a crisis of this proportion can force people to commit.  Most countries began to turn the tide in the livings favor by implementing some for of the Redeker plan which basically openly calls for sacrificing a large portion of the population to serve as bait to lure the zombies away from a core group of survivors and military who were then able to start re-creating some semblance of a new world and come up with a plan to take their country back from the zombies.  When you first hear the premise of the plan it sounds horrifying that the leaders you trust to take care of you could willing throw you to the wolves so to speak but then you also look at the alternative of having no hope of anyone ever defeating the zombies otherwise.  It's a lose-lose situation and I would not have wanted to be one of those that made the decision.<br /><br />I was surprised that although you do not follow a main character (other than the interviewer) throughout the book you are drawn into each interviewee's story.  The main question I had and maybe I missed it since I wasn't feeling well when I read this book was what ever happened to North Korea?  They say North Korea went silent and no one knows what happened to the people.  I don't believe that was resolved in the end so I suppose that could leave an opening for a sequel.  This is definitely not your typical zombie book.  Yes, there is some discussion of the fights between humans and zombies but this focuses on the emotional affect the war had on humanity and the decisions people were forced to make in order to survive.

B001K98MFU|5.0|Some guy wrote about Dreamworks. Dreamworks had nothing to do with this film. As for relating to the original film, I understand it. I understand the plot. I have watched a lot of films in my 52 years and by far this is the best of the best and anybody who could possibly put this film below a 4 should reconsider. The audio is awesome. The graphics are breath taking. I see nothing wrong with this film at all I give nothing but praises to it.<br />I was entertained to the fullest. It is truly worth a Blue Ray purchase. There is always something to be said of the purpose of the film. The corporate folks want $$$$ that is a given. But us the watchers, viewers, audience. We are the ones that count. When I watch a film I watch it to see if it affects me in anyway shape or form but more importantly does it affect me visually or emotionally to the fullest. This film did. I have never seen a film with more breath taking graphics in it than this film. Emotionally it did not bring me to tears but I came to know more of the feelings of Batou than before. For folks who cannot even get the company who made the film right. Time to re-read some.

A big thumbs up from me.
6305736650|5.0|Without question, one of the most influential films of it's generation and one of the greatest love stories ever.  Considering it was just \\"another production\\" on the Warner Bros assembly line, and Bogart wasn't even the front runner for the role of Rick, it's made it's mark in cinematic history.  This DVD special edition is superb; it features interviews with Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall, the screenwriters and those who were close to the production of the movie as it was being made.  The film itself has been digitally restored and is, as always just as relevant now as it was to it's generation.

B001HN697M|3.0|For \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans,\\" Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy (both top-billed) come back as Lucian and Viktor, leaders of the two feuding clans - the Vampires and the Lycans, or werewolves. Being a prequel to the previously released \\"Underworld\\" (2003) and \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" (2006), the third installment of the \\"Underworld\\" saga will show us the origin of the century-long conflict between them.    Besides the fans of the \\"Underworld\\" franchise, those who haven't seen the previous installments can also enjoy the film as a stand-alone film. Set in medieval times, the story follows the Romeo and Juliet-like romance between Lucian (Michael Sheen), a young werewolf and slave of the aristocratic vampires, and Sonja (Rhona Mitra), daughter of Viktor (Bill Nighy) the leader of the Vampires. And of course there are actions, too.    Steven Mackintosh as Tannis and Kevin Grevioux as Raze reprise their roles in the previous installments. Kate Beckinsale, who played Selene, appears briefly as a cameo.    The fans of the \\"Underworld\\" series may not agree with me, but the story of \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" falters at times, due to the confusing relations between the Vampires and the Lycans, and some scenes that drag on (Sonja's \\"love scene\\" for instance). Once the film sets up the storyline for Lucian, Sonja and Viktor, however, the film becomes easier to follow with several decent battle actions.     \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" is helmed by first-time director Patrick Tatopoulos, who is better known for his works as creature designer. Though he is not bad as film director who can shoot action scenes very well, he is not the best storyteller either. Overall, the film is fairly entertaining, but with better storytelling this could have been much better.

B001M5UDGS|3.0|First off, I have to say that I am one of those \\"Whedon Is God\\" fanboys.  I used to be a normal person, but Buffy, Angel, and Firefly converted me.  I am of the cult.  And I have bought everything that Whedon has produced, including the comics he's written and that gawdawful Alien movie, plus several books ABOUT him and his art--\\"The Psychology of Joss Whedon,\\" \\"Fear and Loathing in Sunnydale\\"--a lot of LOT OF stuff.    So I'm a full-on Whedon geek.    But lately?  \\"Dollhouse\\" has not lived up to my expectations, which admittedly were probably unrealistic.    But \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" was even more disappointing.  Maybe that's because I didn't get into the spirit of the thing.  Treated as a movie, or as an episode of TV show, it's just sort of...cheesy.      Now, as something created specifically for the Interwebs, on a shoestring, during a strike, with actors having a blast?  Sure, it stands as an accomplishment of sorts once all the qualifiers are brought in.  But asked to defend the quality of the art just taken on its own, without qualification, and much as I love Whedon and the creative spirit that went into making \\"Horrible,\\" I find I don't have much to recommend.    And it pains me to say that.    So for hard-core fans who have to have all of Whedon's output, and are willing to cut him some slack on the strength of his overall genius, of course... of COURSE ...it's a must-have.  But for casual fans or people just seeking high-quality entertainment, don't let this be your introduction to Whedon.  For that, perhaps a good place to start would be \\"Serenity,\\" the film follow-up to the cancelled TV series \\"Firefly.\\"     See what Whedon's really capable of, and begin to understand what all the fuss is about.
B0002DB52M|5.0|This is about as far away as one can get from a 'feel good' flick, yet it is undeniably powerful and delivers a most difficult subject to ponder that really is one of the central themes to the human experience: the delicate balance between good and evil and how one navigates in the waters of extreme polarity. Director Lars von Trier has created a uniquely affecting tale that is played out on a single soundstage with only the most basic of non-human elements so that the focus can be exclusively on the relationships of the people in 'Dogville'. And it is this intense development of the dynamics of the character's interactions that makes this film the powerful statement it is.<br /><br />What we see in the gradually developing story of Dogville is how noble traits such as good intentions, giving, forgiveness and long suffering - when taken to the extreme - can actually empower evil and destroy oneself. It seems to me the message in this film is that self love is equally important as love for others. And so, we are taught an important lesson of Balance here. This issue comes to a dramatic pinnacle with Grace's conversation with her gangster-boss father (James Caan) near the end of the film in the back of his limo. They both represent arrogance in polarized opposite ways: hers of the lightside; his of the dark.<br /><br />In the end, Grace chooses to 'balance the scales' in order to find her own peace and resolution for the horrors inflicted upon her. We witness karmic debt being cancelled as Dogville goes up in flames. In my sense of fairness, it couldn't have ended any other way, and be truthful. I say this not to condone the actions she ultimately chooses here: the movie is what it is. It's a lesson in just how out of balance one can become in trying to 'love' others that we actually become that which we hate: In Grace's case, her altruism taken to the extreme ultimately transforms her into violent retribution. We are left to speculate that she could have created a much different and more humane outcome simply by not allowing herself to become the doormat for all those who did indeed exploit her. That would have not been possible unless she played the role she played. Had she embraced more self respect and defined her boundaries, the nasty outcome would most probably have been aborted entirely. What we see played out here is the natural result of embracing extremes of polarity. The truth (and sanity) lies in a healthy balance between the two.<br /><br />This is a most unique and thought-provocative film about what it means to be human and live in the cosmic soup of good and evil that we find ourselves in. I believe that most people desire to be good and kind to their neighbor. However, there are healthy limits to how much abuse one can take and if we do not also be kind to ourselves, we are out of balance and we end up with a mini (or major)-Dogville on our hands. This is an issue that is central to everyone's life to some degree and one we must all come to resolution with eventually. In contemplating this further, was it not her own fear that inspired her playing the role of doormat? She wanted to 'be saved'. THAT was her foundational error.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman's acting in this film is probably the best of her career. She is convincing as the archetypical altruistic martyr as she continually chooses to overlook the bad behaviour of those around her, making allowances for their 'weaknesses' and deliberately forgives those who exploit her. Excellent also is Paul Bettany as Tom, who is also an archetype of an all too common character: seemingly kind and good-hearted at first, but when push comes to shove is revealed to be a weak, spineless, self-serving wimp with no real integrity. With Tom, goodness is really all just 'appearance'. There are many archetypes of dysfunctional humans in this film... it is indeed a cross section of humanity. (May God have mercy on us all). Director Trier developes all characters with equal skillas he weaves the tale in layer upon layer of psychological intrigue.<br /><br />This film is not easy to watch, for it's really a study of the dark side of humanity. But I think it is a necessary one. It is also a rather long film, and it did take me a little while for it to grab and sustain my attention, due to the unorthodox 'theatrical' setting which took some getting used to just because it so 'different'. But due to the many excellent reviews here I persevered and I'm glad I did for once I allowed myself to become part of the Dogville world, I was quite affected. Dogville reveals itself to be a powerful metaphor for the entire world and all of humanity. Yes, we indeed live in a realm of the predator and the prey, and it seems the thing that matters most is not the ultimate outcome but how we choose to navigate our way through the treacherous waters: how fairly we treat ourselves, as equally as how fairly we treat others.<br /><br />Substance worth pondering indeed.er upon layer of psychological intrigue.

1416550534|2.0|I just could not get into this book! I put it down, picked it up, put it down, picked it up etc. etc.   I was so looking forward to a good, old fashioned story from all the reviews this book got including a starred review, and especially when it was compared to \\"The Thirteenth Tale,\\" which was one of my absolute favorite books!  It was boring and \\"same old thing\\",  and I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't.   So sorry, I hate to put a book away without finishing it, but I just couldn't read this one anymore. I hope Kate Morton's next one, \\"The Forgotten Garden\\", is better!
B001SMC91M|5.0|I went to see Mates Of State in Dallas, TX and Black Joe Lewis was opening for them. I enjoyed them so much, I just HAD to have physical copy of their music and went and bought a CD after the show (something I rarely do).     This band is extremely funky and talented. The use of horns and 'James Brown' style of singing makes Black Joe Lewis & The Honeybears a truly enjoyable experience.    I plan on seeing them every time they come to town, and I HIGHLY recommend you do the same.

0375836675|5.0|Markus Zusak's I Am the Messenger is a poetic tale, masterfully crafted to be honest, but realistically unrealistic.  The plot is set up in a thoroughly original way, unraveling a mystery through a deck of cards.  The characters, too, have their original traits, letting the reader really see the beauty that exists in ugly.  While everything is a little hard to believe (would people really be that happy to receive help from a stranger, with no questions, taking these symbolic gestures so emotionally, knowing exactly how they were meant to be interpreted?), the message is one that will resonate long after the book has been put down, with a truly empowering ending.  However, while the message of random acts of kindness is a strong and resonating one, I have discovered that much of the plot is not.  After reading this book twice now, I still can barely remember one clue from the next, and everything blurs together.  It is still completely worth the read, as once you're in, you're in, and you won't be able to put this stellar book down.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5
0066620996|4.0|Well researched. I enjoyed this book very much. I feel it is a must read. Mr. Collin's ideas on \\"Optimal Thinking\\" are very interesting. This book spurned so much creativity from within me. I was really able to upgrade in capitalizing on my strengths. Very motivating and entertaining.

B000WMFZMY|5.0|The Deluxe package of El Cid has tons of info that is usually associated with these kinds of issues.  The film itself is simply geogeous and from a time when the \\"cast of thousands\\" were real people and not digitally produced.  The story itself is a bit weak, expecially toward the very end, (there will no plot reveals here), but the sweeping tale of Rodrigo Bovar is so romantic and so beautiful, it makes one yearn for the days when the movie screens were so much bigger than todays multiplex.  I watched the film on a old analog set and the film is still a sight to behold.  Maybe Heston and Sophia not at their best -but it is a joy to look at.
B001IZGPJG|2.0|This is not a review of the music.  Enigma's Seven Lives Many Faces is one of the project's best albums.  The music is wonderful and atmospheric, as usual.    This video, however, falls short on just about every level.  The utter laziness involved is astounding.  Technically, it's like a VHS tape.  The video is presented in widescreen,  but it's not anamorphic.  What that means is that if you own a widescreen TV, you're relegated to watching it in a small window in the center of the screen.  The 5.1 Digital Surround Sound and DTS is a complete joke.  It barely makes use of the rear surround speakers.  It's basically an \\"enhanced stereo\\" presentation.    The videos themselves are a slap in the face to all fans.  Roughly 70% of the videos consist of scenes from Enigma's early videos from the first four albums.  Moreover, the clips even repeat themselves throughout this video (okay, so they added some cheesy visual filter this time).  The remaining 30% is actually original, and those are the better ones (I really liked the video for \\"The Same Parents\\").      I got this DVD using a gift card, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.  To me, it lessens the majesty that Seven Lives Many Faces is.  If Michael Cretu had produced original videos to this, like he did with the MCMXC a.D. video album, this could've been wonderful.  Fans would already own MCMXC a.D. and Remember the Future DVD's, so this is in essence buying the same thing.

B001P9KR8U|1.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie - after hearing/seeing all the hype that is. And, now that I have just WASTED two hours of my life waiting for something mildly entertaining,  that's JUST what it is. H.Y.P.E.   How You Possibly Endure - this movie that is!!! (get the anacronym if you have half a brain!)   Practical advice? - watch \\"Radio Days\\" Much more suspenseful, better story line and better acting.   I can't imagine why there was so much fuss made over this movie, other than for (need I say) POLITICAL reasons, and by that I don't mean it even makes a point about anything (I WISH it did!) No! Someone paid someone a huge amount of cash to get nominated. I can't see any other reason this would even be CONSIDERED.  It's CRAP people. C.R.A.P. RUBBISH!!! Don't waste your time watching this over-long, badly acted, run-of-the-mill, PREDICTABLE peace of garbage.  The story is SOOOOO predictable. There IS mild tension when he is fed the wrong answer by the git in charge of the show (ooops! there goes the suspense - heck, do I care?!) but the rest of it is this psuedo love-affair rubbish with flashbacks to a past, supposed to be triggered by the 'questions' on the game show. Totally BOOORING!!!   How in heaven's (or Buddha's or Krishna's or whatever the Hindi religion is) name THIS got to receive so many nominations is almost as mystical as how they 'forgot' to ASK (ehem! we have all SEEN 'Millionaire\\" How can you be so callous with your continuity?) the contestant WHO to phone when it comes to 'phone a friend'??  Der! I mean, \\"PLEASE\\". Credit us with knowing EVERYTHING about this show, so don't skimp on the details.  This is possibly the BIGGEST waste of movie-going experience in history!! Certainly, THIS decade.  Then again, maybe it's HOLLYWEIRD'S biggest prank!  Sorry people. The joke IS on us - for once!  Forget this one.

630460291X|4.0|This is not the best of the Robin Hood movies (think Errol Flynn...way better) but it is more modern and has Kevin Costner which is enough for some people.  Personally I am and always will be a Morgan Freeman fan so this was great fun to watch as his character is definately more likable then anything Kevin Costner could come up with (real or fictional...sorry Kev.)  This is a great movie for slumming around on a rainy afternoon when you've got nothing else to do and it is definately kid friendly!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|First of all I have to say that Twilight has nothing on this movie. To me Twilight just seemed like a joke. I think only teenage girls really like that movie. Anyway this is a love/vampire story. It focuses more on the bond between Oskar and Eli than on all of the Vampire stuff. I was really sad to see the film end, even though it does have a great ending. Just buy it, you won't regret it.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and as soon as I got home I put in an order at Amanzon.  I wouldn't call this a great movie but it certainly was fun.  It was a little Gone with the Wind, a little Indiana Jones, a litle bit Western and a bit romance.  It is always good to see Hugh Jackman.
B00015TOCY|5.0|Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) is Eno's best, and certainly one of the greatest albums of music ever created.  When cited by critics, Eno's Another Green World or Here Come The Warm Jets are chosen as his best and/or one of the best of the 70s, but they are all wrong.  This album exceeds both and contains some of the most complex songwriting, instrumentation, and production ever created.  If you are a fan of challenging music and/or film, and choose art that requires attention and focus, this work of art is for you.
0375756736|4.0|It's been years since I first read Sense and Sensibility.  I was nineteen, and while I loved it back then I've had the feeling that I'd probably appreciate it more as an adult reader.  Or who knows, I'll probably end up hating it the second time around.  Lucky for me, that wasn't the case.  This is definitely not Austen's best work (I'll explain why later), but its simple tale of two sisters who are as different as night and day and how they deal with financial destitution, heartbreak and feelings in general is still wonderful to me after all this time.  Those who have read S&S know that this is the story of the Dashwood women -- a mother and her three daughters -- and how they have to adjust to a new situation after the girls' half-brother inherits their large country estate.  The aforementioned readers would also know that the two elder sisters, Elinor and Marianne, fall in love for the first time.  Elinor is the oldest and with the most sense, preferring to suffer in silence in order to honor promises and not bring her family unnecessary pain.  Marianne, on the other hand, believes in total emotional and passionate abandon.  Transparent to a fault, she often ends up hurting and alienating people in her whims and heartbreak.  Throw in meddling neighbors, a womanizing cad, a gentleman colonel, a jealous little  interloper and you get a story full of intrigue and twists.<br /><br />As said earlier, I love Sense and Sensibility now more than I did thirteen years ago.  Austen is one of those writers that draw you in with her sharp wit and satirical look into the society around her.  I couldn't put this book down and it proved to be the perfect antidote for my cold and flu.  I still think Edward Ferrars is awkward and gutless, Willoughby is a total player (and I so don't feel sorry for him when he explains himself to Elinor.  He made his bed, after all.  Elinor is far more forgiving than I am), Marianne is whiny and rude and Lucy Steele is probably the nastiest character in the whole book.  Mrs. Jennings is still hilarious and I laughed at Austen's ironic narrative.  However, this novel is not perfect.  There are way too many twists that Austen pulls out at the last pages that strike me as bizarre and like a copout.  I won't go into detail in case someone who hasn't read the book is reading this, but those who have read it probably know what I'm talking about.  But flaws and all, Sense and Sensibility is still my third favorite Austen (Pride & Prejudice and Persuasion are my two first faves, in that order) and rereading this book was like reuniting with old friends.  What a wonderful treat!er in the whole book.  Mrs. Jennings is still hilarious and I laughed at Austen's ironic narrative.  However, this novel is not perfect.

0393312836|5.0|First off, it's not easy to read. There was a rape going on and i had no idea. After i got halfway through the book i quit because i couldn't understand it. I came back later and re-read through old parts, looked up words that wasn't real and re-read parts again. The end payed off. If you can get past the language issue, I don't see why anyone wouldn't like this story. A pretty deep book.

B0019UGYK0|5.0|One of Paul Newman's best performances, and truly one of his best films (I still don't know why I didn't nominate this in Best Picture for my personal awards); `Cool Hand Luke' is not only very, very cool; it is very, very impressive.  With powerful acting and one of the most poignant and powerfully moving endings of it's time, `Cool Hand Luke' is not just a staple for avid Newman fans, but this is a film for anyone who loves film; period.<br /><br />Paul Newman plays Luke, a rebellious young man doing some time for vandalism.  He's strong willed and very independent, qualities that don't mesh well with prison life.  He knocks heads with a few people, not the least of which is the Captain (a ruthless Strother Martin) and Dragline (Oscar winner George Kennedy).  Dragline and Captain are determined to break Luke, but for different reasons and in different ways.  Dragline, the prisons gang leader, wants to break Luke into submission, but soon he begins to admire Luke's unwavering pride.  The Captain wants to humiliate and destroy Luke (that midnight digging scene sends chills down my spine EVERY time I watch this movie).<br /><br />The films ending is really where the heart of the film lies, and where the characters that have been being developed become full and real and most impressionable.  I won't even get into the ending (I am not going to ruin this for anyone) but just know that Luke's final decision rings so true, even today.<br /><br />It's a pure and brutally honest depiction of our subconscious yearnings.<br /><br />The acting is a huge highlight here, and Paul Newman further cements himself as one of the finest actors to ever work in Hollywood (I've been known to confess him as my favorite actor of all time).  What he does with Luke is marvelous; constructing a man who is self inflicted with feelings he refuses to share, reserving himself until the end when his true afflictions are made bare.  Newman creates a perfect façade for Luke, a faux sense of security, which only adds to his eventual breakdown.  George Kennedy was amazing as Dragline, a truly inspired performance.  He's witty when needed, gruff when needed and even charming (he is the true definition of `buddy' here).  A lot of people have knocked his Oscar win in the years that followed it, but he was truly deserving (even if I would have given the award to Hackman).  I also want to point out Strother Martin for his devilish performance, truly spine chilling.<br /><br />So, like I said, this is a marvelous film and is one that I highly recommend to any and everyone I talk to.  I'm so glad my father ranted and raved about this long enough for me to finally commit to watching it (that Paul Newman TCM marathon didn't help either) and so, in like manner, I plan on ranting and raving this film until you see it too!, which only adds to his eventual breakdown.

006082543X|5.0|This book is a graphic adaptation of Gaiman's original novel.  It tells the story of Coraline, a curious young girl who discovers a secret door in her house.  The door takes her to what seems like a duplicate of her house, with parents that look like hers but have buttons for eyes.  They want to keep Coraline and she has to use her bravery and cleverness if she wants to escape from this other world and return to her own.  This was the first graphic novel that I have read and I was very impressed.  The artwork was done beautifully and really grasped your attention.  My only complaint is that it took me much longer to read the book than I expected because I was so interested in every detail of the artwork.  The story was very good, and would appeal to older children who enjoy fantasy and horror stories.  Some of the pictures are frightening, so I would not recommend it for young children.  I am now very interested in going to see the movie!

0060566108|5.0|\\"Built to Last,\\" in a nutshell, tries to extract the reason for success behind some of the greatest corporate success stories in American history. What do companies like 3M, Boeing, Sony, and Hewlett-Packard have in common, and what made them rise above the pack and keep enduring?<br /><br />The idea that this subject could extract principles that apply to any organization, from Exxon-Mobil down to an individual person running a small, self-employed business, and that this book is so highly respected in the business community says that there might be something compelling for all of us between the covers. For instance, I read it for ideas on how to make The Simple Dollar a long-term thing. Let's dig in together and see what there is to learn.<br /><br />The Best of the Best<br />The book opens by seeking to identify visionary companies - best of breed companies within their respective areas that have endured over time. Some companies peak and then fall off (like, uh, Enron) and others stay around for a long time but never stay on top of any area (like Colgate, for instance). The book winds up identifying a list of eighteen companies - Citicorp, Procter and Gamble, Philip Morris, American Express, Johnson and Johnson, Merck, General Electric, Nordstrom, 3M Ford, IBM, Boeing, Walt Disney, Marriott, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Sony, and Wal-Mart - that have persisted at or near the top of their respective areas for a long time, surviving leadership changes and drastic changes in the marketplace. While I can think of a few companies that could be added to this list (Microsoft immediately comes to mind), I do have to say that all of the companies here did reinvent themselves and manage to stay relevant for a very long time (even if a few are having troubles right at the moment).<br /><br />Clock Building, Not Time Telling<br />When you look at that list of companies, what do they make? You'll probably come up with a long list of answers, but they all made one thing in common: an organization that could survive any personnel change, product change, or market change. Great ideas and great leaders might have helped in some cases, but neither one of those is absolutely necessary. What mattered was defining a process that worked regardless of the product, the idea, or the personnel.<br /><br />More Than Profits<br />Another interesting piece of the pie is that these companies all have goals in mind that don't mention profits. Their mission doesn't directly involve making money - money just comes in as a result of successfully completing the mission. They use a compelling example with Merck, who gave away millions of doses of Mectizan in the third world, a drug that cures \\"river blindness.\\" It brought them no profits at all - in fact, it was by itself a giant net loss. They did the same exact thing in Japan after World War II - they sold streptomycin there at cost because the Japanese couldn't afford expensive medicine. What happened after that in Japan? Merck became the dominant American pharmaceutical company there because they didn't just talk the talk about healing the world, they walked it, too.<br /><br />Preserve the Core/Stimulate Progress<br />A successful company usually has three or four core principles - outside of those principles, the company should be willing to change anything. Companies get into trouble when they start holding onto ideas and \\"rules\\" that are less important and refusing to change when the market changes. Built to Last uses IBM as an example here, showing their three core principles (give full consideration to the individual employee, spend a lot of time making customers happy, and go the last mile to do things right), the success IBM had when they followed them (up until the mid-1980s or so), and the failures after they started adhering to secondary principles, like corporate culture and such.<br /><br />Big Hairy Audacious Goals<br />Here, Built to Last uses Boeing as the primary example, talking about howtime and time again the company bet its entire future on what they saw as the next evolutionary step in the airplane. The challenge, though, is to make sure that these big goals are in line with your core principles - it wouldn't make sense, for example, for Ford in 1909 to revolutionize the railroad industry.<br /><br />Cult-Like Cultures<br />Another element of long-term success is that people in the organization believe in the principles in the organization. This is how often companies with great success bring in new management that doesn't believe in the company's principles - and then proceed to derail everything. Think of Bob Nardelli at Home Depot, for example - he came into a company with some core principles, basically chucked them out the door, and installed a version of what worked at GE. A lot of the Home Depot folks didn't like that much at all, and it created a long period of internal strife there.<br /><br />In other words, everybody involved needs to believe in the same principles. When that fails to happen, then the organization begins to waste a lot of effort working against itself instead of working towards those goals. From my perspective, this is even greater encouragement to throw out the things that don't work.<br /><br />Try a Lot of Stuff and Keep What Works<br />Continuing this same thread, Built to Last also encourages trying a lot of different things, seeing which ones work, and sticking with the ones that do work. Thus, most successful organizations (like 3M) encourage people to spend a percentage of their time simply trying out new things instead of doing the same old same old. A lot of innovative companies do the same - Google comes immediately to mind.<br /><br />Home-Grown Management<br />The book also encourages companies to look for management from within, something I strongly agree with. Almost every large company that brings in a new management team from the outside - particularly from another industry - winds up with some significant problems. For example, Jack Welch came from within GE and Lee Iacocca (at Chrysler) came from Ford and both saw great success, but Bob Nardelli came from GE to Home Depot and it was a big mistake.<br /><br />I truly hope to find a mentor like this someday. I would like to transition my life's work to the right person when the time comes (though that's a long way off). But, if I don't find the right person, I'll just stop the whole thing - I want someone who is intimately involved with my work to take it over and I want that person to believe in the same things.<br /><br />Good Enough Never Is<br />Built to Last believes the biggest enemy of all is complacency. Complacency is the point where you let competitors overtake you because you believe you've earned your spot. That never happens - someone's always waiting to take your place in a competitive market.<br /><br />How do I keep trying to work harder? I read the negative comments and rarely look at the positive ones. This even includes the ones that are obviously people trying to grind an axe that is unrelated to me. The negative comments usually point me to where I need to improve - the positive ones, while reaffirming, usually carry the message that I don't need to improve. And that's dangerous.<br /><br />The End of the Beginning<br />The last principle is that success isn't the end of the road. It's merely the start of it, because now you have to live up to that success. Where can you go from here? It's an eternal question that some companies can answer and some cannot. If you have all of the tools in place, you can usually find the answer to that question. It's a powerful question to always think about, even if you believe that you really are the best - how can you get better?<br /><br />Building a Vision<br />This chapter largely concludes the book by stating that all of these pieces do in fact intersect and come together, showing you a true vision for your organization. This isn't buzzwords or \\"mission statements,\\" but the actual realization of the path you have left to travel and the tools you have to get there.<br /><br />Buy or Don't Buy?<br />Every person who does any sort of side business or is involved in running anything should read this book. It made me think about The Simple Dollar and my other side businesses in a very deep and careful way and it made me realize that the core values I've adopted really are the most important thing of all.<br /><br />I really just scratched the surface of this book here, trying to point out a few of the principles that relate to my own life. This book is far deeper than that and not only relates to things done within an organization, but with how you choose to live your life as well. It brought me to some serious realizations about my principles and what I'm doing - you've already seen some of this in the last few months, and I think you'll start to see more of them.<br /><br />Read this book - it's really worth it.th saw great success, but Bob Nardelli came from GE to Home Depot and it was a big mistake.

B00003W8NM|1.0|I am a big dvd collector and I usually buy movies that I don't regret buying but buying Fight Club was a regret and a waste of my money. I watched the movie once and couldn't make any sense of it but I knew there were a lot of people who do like this movie so I decided to give it another chance and watch it again. I watched the second time and found it to be even worse than the first time. This movie has no real plot and what the movie trys to use as the plot is about the worst plot possible. I think Brad Pitt is a great actor but this had to be one of the worst movies in his career in my opinion.

Di Meola, McLaughlin and De Lucia are amazing musicians each in their own right, from Return to Forever to McLaughlin/Mahavishnu  they have all covered alot of musical ground, though sometimes they get \\"dogged\\" by being technically too good for their own right.    It is easy to miss the forest through the trees as they exchange riffs which tak you breath away, but after getting past the initial impression there is alot to be had hear.      The opening section of Mediterrean Sundance sets the pace and if you listen on a good set of speakers or headphones, the nuances of the playing comes through.  Beautiful music, with humr as they exhange some passages thoroughout the album.    The live performance is perfection and it is hard not to get caught up with the crowd.
B00005QK5X|5.0|As previously stated, these are fantastic albums but support the actual artist and buy it new at the same price as the used ones listed here from[..] or if you're in the Portland, OR area, buy it from the band in person at Zeno Oddities!
B000000OQF|5.0|Simply put this is the greatest album of all time by the the best band line up in history. There will never be anything close to this ever!
B000VI70X6|5.0|This show captures the beauty and talent of a young woman destined for greatness, I became a Shakira fan solely by accident, I mean I never thought I would gravitate to her style, when she released \\"Laundry Service\\" I liked her, thought she was different, but it ended there. Then \\"La totura\\" came out, I did not care that it was Spanish I found the song and video captivating. My intrest grew when she finally released \\"Oral Fixation\\" I knew that I had been missing out on something great. Bought the album loved it, bought the Spanish version of it, I loved it even more (I don't speak a word of Spanish but that album made me a Shakira fan) Needless to say I have collected all her work to date.    Now getting back to this concert, a steller performance, Shakira's image is a lot more simple and earthy this time then her previous concert (also amazing), I loved it. Her voice is soooooo incredible, I never thought much of belly dancing until I saw Shakira do it, NO ONE DOES IT BETTER, an amazing band, amazing choreography and for the most Shakira dances alone on stage and I am used to seeing my favourite stars perform with a troop of dancers. This time around I did not care, her presence shone throughout the concert, her beautiful smile, humble personality, she is sexy but sweet, she transforms in and out of a sex Goddess to a charming sweet character.    I bought all her other CD's simply because I wanted to own those Spanish songs I never heard before. She is clearly loved and of course Miami where the show was recorded, is the capital of Latin beauties. So the audience would drown her out singing back to her and she does not even have to insist for it, she is clearly loved, I love it when an audience loves a star like that.    The show has amazing moments starting off with \\"Estoi Aqui\\" the audience goes wild, her intro to \\"Whenever wherever\\" amazing. She glides through the stage almost effortlessly she makes it seem so easy. This woman writes her own music (Spanish and English), plays instruments, an amazing dancer and is a beauty to look at. The full package, an amazing show a must see.

B001O8C5KK|4.0|The main attraction for me after listening to this set is Antonio Pappano's fabulous conducting.  This is his show, and he gives a very moving and emotional account of Puccini's score. He manages to sustain a sense of tragedy and pathos throughout the opera without making it depressing.  The intensity and urgency he delivers is almost palpable from the first measure.  This is a beautiful and exciting reading.<br /><br />This is opera, of course, so I must give mention to the lead singers.  In Pappano's hands, they create a memorable and unique contribution to the catalog of complete Butterfly recordings.  Angela Gheorghiu surprises me because I expected her voice to be too foggy and mature for this role, but she sounds quite fresh and even girlish here, and her portrayal is ultimately touching. I have mixed feelings about her famous fragile sound, but here I underestimated her.  Jonas Kaufmann's voice is unusual for a tenor because he sounds so much like a baritone with a very masculine and dramatic vocal quality.  When he hits the thrilling high notes it almost sounds improbable due to his timbre - very different but still very good.  Capitanucci sounds a little immature for Sharpless, but his singing is also very good.  Shkosa is a feisty, strong-voiced Suzuki (nice compliment to Gheorghiu), and the character role of Goro is a good fit for Bonfatti.  I hear no weak link in this cast.<br /><br />Again, I give most of the credit to Pappano for this fine recording.  With 21st century technology, the sound is absolutely gorgeous.  I expect I will listen again and again. Recommended.

B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I found this to be an excellent presentation of the book Fountainhead. It is a great movie a movie that has meaning in the world of today, a message that has meaning for all people of all time. An individual that can remain true to his own creativity and stand against those who seek only to be part of the pack. Ayn Rnad's Howard Roark played by Gary Cooper is an inspiration to all - or should be.
157270487X|5.0|Q & A was very similar to the movie Slumdog Millionaire, but I thought it was better. It was sadder and gave more detail of how difficult life could have been in old Bombay. I do not know how factual it is, but it was an interesting story with enough surprises of why a poor boy could know answers to a game show.
B001GQACGO|2.0|she's beyonce and because of this she will sell. she's older now and i expected more. more adultish lyrics and more grown and sexy. i was hoping for actually r&b but instead I got garbage. she get's a 3 because she's beyonce. honestly her lyrics suck and are at times so simplicit that it's annoying. i wish she would actually be something other than a catchy pop diva. she has an amazing voice and i wish she would do something with depth. i suppose her cd is comparable to her performance in cadillac records. all hype but no deliverance with the exception of maybe a second or so of something worthy. i just wish she would do something other than what she has been doing. i know some don't like diva but i personally like it. it's grown on me however i detest ego. why not go ahead and put it all out there. she's missing sexual appeal through her songs and honestly that'll take away from her fan base that's grown with her also. i also think she doesn't always have substance. somehow someway she's missing it. i'm so glad i burnt this from my bf(she bought it) instead of buying it. she almost had me as a buyer. oh well
1416550542|3.0|The basic core story for this novel is very good, but the writer's treatment can be somewhat confusing.  I found myself flipping back and forth to keep track of various characters and events. Without giving away too much (remember, readers, this is not supposed to be a book report or  synopsis!) there are three generations of women, two of whom go back to England from Australia to figure out their origins and history.  The author chose to skip around in the time line and while that in itself is a good plan, the style in which she does this can be somewhat confusing.  The mystery is held together until the last but the interspersing of \\"fairy tales\\" into the mix and the fractured style of the timeline is all a bit overreaching and serve to weaken the story instead of making it stronger.<br /><br />Overall, I felt this would be a good book for teenage girls to read as they would probably relate to the characters more than I could, being a 50 year old man.  It is well written and the characters are very fleshed out and memorable, which is far more than I could say for many novels today. The writer's descriptions are cinematic in places and it's easy to see how this book might translate into a movie script. I just hope that if this were to happen, the filmmakers don't slice it up too much with a ton of flashbacks like the authoress here has done.
0930289234|5.0|everyone should read this at least 5 times in there life.  i could not put it down.  one of the most interesting, thought-provoking pieces of popular fiction i have ever had the privilege of reading.
B0000AUHPB|4.0|I wanted to own this great title. They never show it on TV since the remake came out. I played it on my PS3 which upconverted it to near Hi-Def and it was great! Fun movie and better that the remake which was still pretty good.  I don't often buy movies so this one is a keeper.
0714843377|5.0|Great little book.<br /><br />If you're thinking that you will get something new, totally revolutionary, and out of the box, you will be very disappointed. The advise and ideas in the book are very widely known, things you already do, and in most cases, the author keeps repeating himself.<br /><br />However, its really sweet, easy read, and provides a great positive reenforcement to you, and assures you that you will get your desired success.<br /><br />I recomend this book to anyone from fresh grads to seasoned executives.
1934030198|5.0|I have enjoyed Joe Friel's writing in that he provides well referenced scientific literature as well as life experience.

B001PPLIEG|3.0|I had high expectations given how great \\"Casino Royale\\" was and this film disappointed in almost every regard. Its not a bad film and its not among the many bad bond films. Its just another very ordinary James Bond film.     The idea of doing it as a sequel and focusing on the death of someone from the previous film was a big mistake. The film was too much about things that had happened before and that tended to drag it down. It also gave it a completely aimless plot.    The action scenes were also very poorly constructed. Everything they got right in \\"Casino\\" they get wrong here. Everything is shot at fast forward in \\"shaky cam\\". The result is a muddy blur where half the time its not clear whats going on.    The film was also too obviously political. We have a water crisis and eco-hotels. Water wells and ultramodern hotels blowing up are just not interesting.
B001MYIXAC|2.0|The cover of the dvd says \\"Best. Vampire. Movie. Ever.\\" Wow. I was expecting awesomeness times ten to the nth power. What I got was a barely comprehensible movie that had no surprises, no horror, no sense. I was literally almost bored to death, if that counts as horror.. ;)The version I saw was dubbed in english-oh how I hate dubbed movies-all the real acting comes across in how things are said, and when you dub, you kill the movie. The relationships in the movie were not explained well, either. Oskar is with his dad, then some other guy shows up and Oskar gets upset, but you dont know why, because nothing is said. And the caretaker of Eli, you dont understand what his deal is, why he kills for her, what their real relationship is. Brams Dracula with Gary Oldman is still the best vampire movie ever to me; this is just the weirdest swedish movie ever.
6305657947|5.0|I recently saw this film again and it has aged very well. Its an escapist \\"caper\\" picture cleverly done. Its also far less depressing than the original was while almost as stylish. The basic plot has a board rich man (Pierce Brosnan) turn to over-the-top crime and a conflicted insurance investigator (Rene Russo) going after him.    The only thing I disliked was the poorly constructed way that Pierce Brosnan became the prime suspect in the case. Everything else was well thought out but the logic of the film at that particular point was lacking. The introduction of the thearpy sessions was a good step over the original though in that it made the Thomas Crown character more human.

B001UOVP1S|5.0|\\"Scream\\" by Chris Cornell is one of the most creative collaborations to come out of popular music in a while. Unfortunately it is a very polarizing album as well.    I believe fans of Chris fall into two categories, those who love rock and those who love Chris.  If you are a die hard rock fan and do not have an appreciation for any other type of music, you will hate this album.  If you love Chris for his voice, creativity, originality, and artistry then you will love this album.  I personally think that Chris Cornell is one of the most unappreciated artists of our time.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This movie is a must see. It's the kind of movie that restores one's faith in stories that seem improbable. It's an intriguing movie that dips deep into hope, honor, and love and lets one believe that good things can once again happen in a world where it seems unlikely these days.
0307346617|5.0|What a great book. Couldn't put it down once I started reading it. It ranks up there with all of the classic George Romero films like Night of the Living Dead. Hopefully once they make this into a film it will be as great as the book!
1400082773|1.0|Talk about self-absorbed! Stuck in a self-centered identity crisis that he doesn't seem to grow out of, Obama let me down in this book and I couldn't force myself to read the last section. I ended up selling it at Half-Price Books.
B000VBP382|5.0|This was a fantastic purchase for the price.  I enjoy the book, 2 DVDs, & CD of the soundtrack.  The book gave more insight to the characters while each DVD gave different Bonus information.  I recommend this product to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen as well as Keira Knightley & Matthew Macfayden.
0316017922|5.0|Well written and researched.  Malcolm Gladwell examines why certain statistical portions of the population (outliers) achieve or do not achieve success.  For instance, he explains why the people of a small town in New York have long lives and low crime despite greasy foods, smoking and alcohol consumption.  He also states the obvious of why people, like Bill Gates, achieve their success, namely the time of which they were born and the over 10,000 hours of practise.  A good read for anyone looking beyond the fallacies of dumb luck, talent or education alone.
B000LW7UR8|5.0|I was very pleased with the time in which I received the cd. My only dislike is that although I knew it didn't have the original case, I would have preferred it be packaged a little more better. It came in a paper slip cover in an envelope. Might be the reason why it came cracked on the edge of the cd. Luckily it still plays so I did not ask for a refund or exchange. Again, I was very happy with the promptness of it being sent. I ordered from someone else on amazon, paid expedited shipping, and still did not receive my order in the stated time. I wouldn't recommend them but I would recommend this seller.
B000A0GXGA|1.0|This is the worst quality DVD set I have ever seen.  Cheap packaging, very poor quality audio and video.  Many episodes are literally unwatchable.  Seriously, unbelievably, BAD.  Total rip-off.  DO NOT BUY.
B000V86OKG|3.0|I haven't finished watching the second season, but already I can't stand Rita.  And what's the deal with Dexter hopping-to everytime drama queen Rita pitches a fit?  I thought he didn't have any feelings, and quite frankly, I liked him better when he didn't.  Darkly Dreaming Dexter (the book) really gets into Dexter's mind, and for that reason, I like it better than the series.  That being said, most of the other characters play better on TV than the book.  All in all, I like the acting, and very much like the differences between the series and the books.  I just can't stand whiny, bitchy, Rita.  Dex should do something about her.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|This has become my new \\"favorite\\" movie since \\"The 6th Sense\\".  The two little boys in the beginning (Jamal and Salim) are too precious!  They are undoubtedly \\"bad\\" but only because of the situations they encounter. Every woman on earth wants the kind of love Jamal has for Latika. I can't imagine those people that gave it 3, 2 or 1 stars, saw the same movie I did.  Some people said the acting was poor. I thought it was great especially since I heard that none of them were professional actors before.  They sure seemed like it.  Anyway  it is a movie for all people. It you like action, violence, romance, even comedy...it is there. Thank you for making such a wonderful movie.

B001DPHDCY|5.0|I really did love this movie. The animation was one of, if not the best that I have seen. The colors and textures just popped right out at you. As, for the acting Jim Carrey does a wonderful job here with Horton. I really did not enjoy him at all in HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS but he more then made up for it in this charmer. Great for the whole family!

B000WZAE1I|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I first saw this movie and I was very pleasantly surprised.   It's fantasy but not formulaic - it had some very original ideas, a clever plot, and some performances that are out of the actors' usual stereotypes (Robert de Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer).   I can go back and watch it every couple of months and enjoy it again - even my husband watched it again, so it's not a typical chick flick.

0061122416|5.0|I enjoyed it too much to put the first copy in my classroom library.   Working with eighth graders of different ability levels, I have a hard time finding books that work on lots of levels which are at the same time generally acceptable to a range of parents.  This one fits the bill!  After keeping one for my home shelf, I've purchased for the class shelves and found a winner.  Some readers need a chance to speak to the teacher to be really clear on the underlying allegory.  However, even they enjoy the story on the surface enough to read it through, and they are intrigued by the ideas underneath.  I suspect for many of them, it is the first book they read voluntarily that actually has layers. For adult readers, it provides plenty of different layers to consider, too.  That also makes it a great option for shared family reading between teens and parents.
B001IB63J2|1.0|i love this MCR album on my ipod but i really prefer vinyl generally. i was really excited when i saw that there was finally a vinyl release but when i put the record on i was really disappointed how hissy it sounds. listening to a great vinyl pressing always reminds me that kids growing up with mp3s (and to some extent cds) really missed out on the medium that is most likely to create a fulfilling, dynamic and memorable listening experience. the band & record company really should have spent the money on a 180 gram black vinyl pressing instead of flashy gimmicks like a stencil. maybe if we are lucky they will press it again in a few years with the normal artwork and a record that sounds as good as the content of the album. despite how much i love this album i ended up selling it used and went back to listening to the mp3s.
B000FC2O48|4.0|Overview:<br /><br />A well-thought-out tale, but not a complete one, Ubik is the story of the destruction of Runciter's anti-paranormal agency at the hands of its pro-paranormal counterpart, Hollis. The plot is reasonable, although not well-developed. The characters are a fairly typical Dick cast, as the Wikipedia article on this book points out. The conflict is interesting, and the resolution is nice (before the last two pages), although a lot more could have been done with this plot.<br /><br />The idea of people being in half-life cold-storage is underutilized, along with many other aspects of the book, suggesting that perhaps Philip Dick had something greater in mind when he wrote this, but that it lost favor in his eagerness to work on another project. Nevertheless, it was worth reading, despite ample room for improvement.<br /><br />A. Plot<br /><br />The plot of this twisted tale takes a bit to start but once it does, it is worthwhile. The first sixty pages or so merely outline the competition between Runciter's \\"prudence\\" organization of anti-psychics and Hollis's psychic spies. This would have been more meaningful and worthwhile if this was a part of a larger pantheon of stories set in the same alternate future, but, at least to the extent of my ability to tell, it is not. As such, it seems like a grinding waste of 40% of the book.<br /><br />Once the plot get moving along, all youknowwhat breaks loose quite fast, and then you are left wondering what just happened, because no where earlier does it suggest what a humanoid bomb is. Then, it gets crazier and weirder for a while, before all of it is nicely tied up in approximately five pages. Pretty common for a Dick novel, but that is part of the problem, no? The plot itself is interesting, I guess, but it feels more like a plot for a television show like Star Trek or the Outer Limits than it does a novel. At 160 pages, though, it is easy enough to see why.<br /><br />The major identifiable conflict in the story is the regression into time. As a sort of man-against-superman or man-against-god conflict, it is pretty well realized, in parts. The regression of time results in serious problems for the main characters, as their cigarettes and food go bad very fast. This begins to stop being a real problem fairly fast, as they reach 1939, and the food curiously stabilizes, along with the time. This could have been handled better, for example, if the people spent more time in each time period, or if the degeneration of the characters proceeded at a slower, more periodic pace, allowing the horror to build.<br /><br />This degeneration, and the subsequent loss of the survivors of the disaster, seems to owe something to Agatha Christie's classic, \\"And Then There Were None...\\". This, really, is what suggests that the loss of the characters should have proceeded more slowly, uniformly, and completely. It would have allowed the sense of horror to appropriately build, prior to the denoument.<br /><br />I have to make a special note of the alternate ending (or whatever) that makes up the last two or three pages. Completely unravelling the other 150+ pages, it managed to make the whole thing seem tepid and meaningless. It was kind of unfortunate. But, I can see why some people would like it; it certainly has the feeling of the author's smirk stamped into it, laughing from beyond the grave.<br /><br />B. Characters<br /><br />The characters in this are more described than they are presented, which is a weak literary technique. Mr. Runciter, for example, seems one way to me as a reader of the third-person-God-voice and a separate way as described by his employees. This inconsistency, while not damning, is never explained or utilized. Perhaps this is because of the shortness of the story, but it feels wrong somehow to work in details like that and then to leave them be.<br /><br />In addition, none of them ever grow, in any apparent fashion. Instead, they finish the story virtually the same as they start it. I found this rather unfortunate, and was one of the reasons that I thought that this novel could have been much better.<br /><br />C. Setting<br /><br />The setting plays an important role here, as it regresses from an alternate future 1992 to a past 1939. This regression, and the settings in the novel, were one of the most interesting aspects, as it is fun to imagine your reaction if you came around a corner and found a telegraph, rather than your email. This temporal discombobulation, and the philosophy that ensues, was the highlight of the book, even if, at times, it didn't really make sense.<br /><br />D. Theme<br /><br />The themes here are instability and confusion. The reasons for this are clear, as it is Philip Dick writing, after all. Taking ANYTHING for granted in a Philip Dick novel is a sure route to confusion. These themes are readily discovered, and are developed clearly, but they are not used in as artistic a fashion as they could be. In order to maximize this effect, there should be additional things that are taken as fact that are revealed as fantastical, such as the entire world that they lived in (as if they discovered at the end of the book that they didn't really ever exist in 1992 at all, and that it was all the creation of a sick mind, and that most of them were not real characters, as that sick mind degenerated itself, losing control both of time and cast). Just off the top of my head, that would be one way in which it could be improved.<br /><br />E. Point of View<br /><br />The point of view here is third person, limited omniscence. It adds nothing and detracts little from the story. In all actuality, individual chapters from the point of view of the protagonists would have been more appropriate in this context, particularly since the setting was so important, and the regression in time was one of the major conflicts in the novel.<br /><br />F. Aesthetics<br /><br />The aesthetics were not a major detractor to the book, nor did they contribute much. The sentences and paragraphs were appropriate in length and tone. The descriptions of virtually everything were brief and utilitarian. Nothing special here.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Not Dick's best effort, this book is marred by its brevity. While I personally think that much of Dick's literature reached its zenith in the short story form, this novel was too short for its own good. It is still worth reading, but it seems less like something by Philip Dick than it does an episode of the Outer Limits or Star Trek. The lack of character development, and the slow plot, suggest that one of two things should have happened. Either it should have been shortened by half and been a long short story, or it should have been twice as long, used under-utilized plot threads and characters, and had a more coherent plot, perhaps with some theories as to the malignant force responsible (more, I mean, than there was).<br /><br />It could have been better in a number of different ways, but it certainly wasn't awful. I would recommend it to science fiction or mystery fans who are looking for a quick read.<br /><br />B-<br /><br />Harkiusthought that this novel could have been much better.    C. Setting    The setting plays an important role here, as it regresses from an alternate future 1992 to a past 1939.

In all actuality, individual chapters from the point of view of the protagonists would have been more appropriate in this context, particularly since the setting was so important, and the regression in time was one of the major conflicts in the novel.    F. Aesthetics    The aesthetics were not a major detractor to the book, nor did they contribute much. The sentences and paragraphs were appropriate in length and tone. The descriptions of virtually everything were brief andutilitarian. Nothing special here.    Conclusion:    Not Dick's best effort, this book is marred by its brevity. While I personally think that much of Dick's literature reached its zenith in the short story form, this novel was too short for its own good. It is still worth reading, but it seems less like something by Philip Dick than it does an episode of the Outer Limits or Star Trek. The lack of character development, and the slow plot, suggest that one of two things should have happened. Either it should have been shortened by half and been a long short story, or it should have been twice as long, used under-utilized plot threads and characters, and had a more coherent plot, perhaps with some theories as to the malignant force responsible (more, I mean, than there was).    It could have been better in a number of different ways, but it certainly wasn't awful. I would recommend it to science fiction or mystery fans who are looking for a quick read.    B-    Harkius
B001P9KR8U|3.0|Slumdog Millionare is a good film, but it is also a very overrated film, and a rather simplistic one.  There are some amazing things in it, but there are some incredibly dull ones as well.<br /><br />Like all of Danny Boyle's films, there is some truly astonishing imagery in this film.  The shots of Mumbai's slums are brilliantly shot (the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, deservedly won an Oscar for his work).  Boyle and company deserve kudos for these scenes, as they are rarely seen in feature filmmaking, and are hardly ever seen in contemporary Bollywood films.  There is also a scene where the children go to an opera, and steal wallets and purses from under the bleachers.  This scene is achingly beautiful, and I wish it was longer.  There are many shots like that in this film.  Boyle has always had an amazing eye, especially in Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.  But too often Boyle dazzles us with eye candy, and his films end up being unrelenting hollow, and Slumdog Millionare is no exception.<br /><br />The script of this film is predictable and, especially in the 2nd half of the film, surprisingly boring.  There is a love story at the heart of the film, and it feels forced, like it doesn't belong there, like the filmmakers insisted that it have some sort of love story in it, like typical Bollywood films do.  The dialogue is very forgettable, and the characters (except for Dev Patel's character) are cartoonish and very one note.  Boyle's array of dazzling images suddenly disappears in the 2nd half when he concentrates on the love story, and he's left with just the story, which is very uncompelling, even though it should be.  The motivation of the TV host is also strange, as it doesn't make any real sense other than to give the story an unnecessary twist.<br /><br />Most of the performances are adequate, but the best one is by Dev Patel.  While he has the classic Bollywood look, you do believe that his character was raised in the slums, and he has a certain anger and sadness that makes you feel for him.  One of the most fascinating things about this film is the jarring (intentionally) juxaposition between Patel's interrogation (he's tortured by the police rather brutally), Patel's life in the slums (which is all done in flashback), and the slick, hollowness of the TV show Who Wants to be a Millionare?.  It works very well, but it's predominantly in the first half, and the 2nd half is much more conventional and quite staid by comparison.<br /><br />The musical score is quite good, especially the end credits song/dance, which is one of the highlights of the film.<br /><br />I think this is another Best Picture Oscar winner that people will question in future years.  Too often the Oscars is not about which is really the best film of the year, but about politics (like great directors like Scorsese winning for mediocre films like The Departed instead of winning for Goodfellas, a true masterpiece), and/or momentum (Slumdog Millionare's wins were all about having momentum and riding a tide, so to speak).  It's not a bad movie at all, but it really is not a fantastic film by any stretch of the imagination.  I would say it's definitely worth seeing, but it isn't a masterpiece.kes you feel for him.

0394800184|4.0|This is a classic early reader, very simple and repetitive for young children. It's a bit long for toddlers, and some preschoolers might find the subject matter too frightening (being lost, not knowing where your mama is). However, I still recommend having this book in your library - if it's too much for your kid this year, it might be just right next year.

1600240682|5.0|I always use audio books/cds when I am teaching my students novels.  I like this one in particular for two reasons: one, there is soft, background music at the closure and beginning of some chapters which truly enhance the mood; two, Sebold narrates the book with a unique, detached tone.  Some of my students found her tone to be indifferent, and they didn't like it because the topic was so emotional. To them, the tone did not match the topic.  But, the detachedness allows Susie's nonchalance to come through.  Teenagers are often indifferent, and Susie understands that nothing she says or does will change the fact that she is dead.  I think Sebold purposefully chose this tone to enhance the purpose of the book.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I had no idea there was such a production until I stumbled on this show on Youtube of all places. Of course, the format was in parts, and so my viewing experience was quite choppy, but all the same I enjoyed it, and am definitely getting the DVD.<br /><br />Austen purists will probably revile this witty adaptation/revision of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, but fans of Austen who aren't too particular and enjoy some liberties taken with Austen's works [in the interest of fun and entertainment] will find lots to enjoy in ITV's four-part series \\"Lost in Austen\\".<br /><br />Jemima Rooper stars as Amanda Price, who is an avid fan of Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice and who yearns for the romance experienced by Darcy and Elizabeth. One day, she is flabbergasted to find Elizabeth Bennet[Gemma Arterton] herself facing her in her bathroom. Apparently, there is a 'magical' door through her bath wall that is able to transport Lizzie from Meryton to contemporary London. Before long, Amanda gleefully wanders through the portal into Lizzie's house with all its chaos, and life as Amanda knows it will never again be the same.<br /><br />Amanda tries her best to get the other characters from P&P to follow through on the novel's plot, a situation made difficult by Lizzie's absence [glibly explained away as visiting Hammersmith, Amanda's home]. Mr Bingley in the meantime finds Amanda more interesting than Jane, and things get more complicated when Amanda meets Mr Darcy[a suitably brooding and haughty, yet drool-worthy Elliott Cowan]. Though Amanda finds Darcy interesting and attractive, his rudeness towards her is irksome, and the pair are soon engaged in witty verbal sparring.<br /><br />The dialogue is part of what makes this production so entertaining. At one point, Jane is ill and ensconced in Bingley's country estate, and Darcy asks that Amanda leave. Bingley protests, saying 'She has paracetamols!' [paracetamol being the British equivalent of our Tylenol, or other fever-reducing medications]. There are lots of anachronisms in this series,which is to be expected given the two distinct time periods.<br /><br />The cast is excellent - Alex Kingston [of ER] plays a very different Mrs Bennett, portraying a woman who has steely determination and can be downright nasty when she feels her interests threatened. Hugh Bonneville makes a livelier Mr Bennett than we are used to in the other adaptations. Guy Henry plays the greasy Mr Collins to a \\"T\\", and his performance actually made me shudder in revulsion. George Wickham's role here is quite surprising, with a twist in his story that was unexpected.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fresh, revisionist approach to P&P, and though it does not follow the traditional plot of P&P, it is fun and entertaining, and with a mostly likable cast that carry this production through. Final verdict - fun and fresh, not to be taken too seriously.ducing medications].

B001PA0FF4|4.0|I had already seen this as a play before the film came out and the most obvious difference between them is Meryl Streep's intepretation of Sister Aloysis versus Linda Hunt or Cherry Jones' take on her on stage.  Streep seems to be more histronic and theatrical versus the restraint of the two actress--almost like she'a witch in a halloween suit!!  Nevertheless, I still found the film worthwhile despite this difference. The final confrontation between Hoffman and Streep is probably screen acting at his best!! And Viola Davis makes her brief appearance count--no wonder she was nominated!! Shanley has succeeded in raising \\"doubt\\" in this fine film.

B001DO2N8Y|5.0|This album rocks! I will not make a hard attempt at putting in words the emotions that I have when I listen to it. You just have to experience it yourself. It puts you in a different state.    One of the best parts of this album is that you keep discovering new things about the songs even after months if not years of listening to them. In my eyes the standout song is the title song. Ironically, when I first listened to it I could not do much with it. It did not move me. However, it slowly started kicking in, and finally I got it. Once it kicked in it kicked in for good!    The band must have been in an extremely creative period when they recorded this album as well its predecessor ('Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me') and the follow-up ('Wish').

I think everyone can relate to this book in one form another, either you connect with Hannah or one of the people who mistreated her.

Not only is the movie amazing and the singing incredible but the special features are all funny and worth watching. I can't say enough in praise of this DVD it is one of the best purchases I have made recently. All that and Felicia Day, she is so lovely and her duet with Neil Patrick Harris is incredible.
0061684384|5.0|kat's book is wonderful. she does a great job explaining the culture and, as someone heavily tattooed that's experienced it, hopefully helped tear down some of the unfortunate prejudices many have towards us. it would be great if being tattooed weren't such a cultural stigma; and i feel like the exposure through her celebrity, her shows and others like it do a great deal of favor to those of us that choose to be tattooed. we're not all junked out criminals and gang members; many of us are professionals, entrepreneurs - successful people who, for whatever reason, choose to be tattooed - that's it.     specifically about her book - it's loaded with great photos of her own work and the work she's done for her clients. of course, the tattooing she does is tops. beyond anything else - her beauty, her celebrity - she's an awesome tattooer. black and grey is NOT an easy medium and her work is consistently great. further, she delves a bit into coming up as a tattooer, all from her own experience. and beyond, she pays tribute to the tattooers that have inspired and influenced her; possibly my favorite chapter.     if you're curious about the world of tattooing, this really is a great book to get your feet wet. it's beautifully laid out and features gorgeous photography; but keep in mind it's specifically HER. don't expect a history lesson. if you're curious about kat and her life and career - obviously, it's the perfect choice. and if you just want to learn that being tattooed does not mean you're some braindead lowlife, check it out.     she's a beautiful soul and i wish her the best.
0451528956|4.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; the words conjure up all sorts of images in my mind, mostly from the theatrical and cinematic depictions I've seen at different times in my life.  I thought I knew the story well, and so I didn't expect to find myself surprised by much in the novel.  How wrong I was!      The novel is interesting, because there are so many aspects of the story that are left to the imagination of the reader.  Mr. Hyde's appearance, as well as his misdeeds, are never defined in black and white, but are instead only alluded to in a manner that almost makes them more horrifying.  I was also intrigued with the complicated nature of the character of Dr. Jekyll, a man who desires to be seen as an upstanding individual, but is in many ways somewhat fascinated by the evil aspects of his nature.      I found this to be a great read, and far more thought provoking than I had anticipated.  It is a very short read, around 100 pages, but provides plenty of \\"meat\\" for the reader to chew on.  If you haven't taken the opportunity to try this book before, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable read.  This has been a great start to my Classics Reading Challenge for 2008, and has left me thirsting for more!

B00004UQBP|1.0|Got this for Christmas 2008, to round out my Pink Floyd collection.  It's a remastered and repackaged version of Ummagumma, cool beans.  Well, now it's early April, 2009, just getting around to listening to it (I'm tired from being \\"blessed\\" with twin 2 year old boys).  I decide to throw in disc 2, which has a lot of songs I haven't heard in forever, but I start hearing Astronomy Domine, which is supposed to be on disc 1.  No prob--I probably put the wrong disc back in the jewel case after I opened it after Christmas to check it out.  So I grab the disc 1 jewel case, open it, and there's disc 1.  I look at what's supposed to be disc 2, and it's also disc 1.  Great.  Wife is pretty sure she got it for me from Amazon.  I'll have to look at the return policy, but I'm thinking it's probably too late to return it.  I think this is the reason why this product is discontinued--nobody gets disc 2.  I really hate to give the Floyd a 1 star rating, but I gotta in this case.

B001CQONKY|4.0|This was a really bittersweet season for me as a GSR CSI fan.  The proposal of marriage and the \\"finally out in the open\\" relationship between Grissom and Sara was very nice in the snippets we were shown.      The way they had Jorja leave the show and what happened after was awful and, I've always felt, unnecessary.  After that it just seemed that the show started to spiral down (which we're still experiencing in Season 9).  There are still glimpses of how good things could be, but the writers did seem to lose their thread quite a bit. It felt like they lost heart in a lot of the episodes in the second half, and the strike didn't help matters.  It turns out that William Petersen and Gary Dourdan had also planned to leave in this season, and what started out as \\"reasons for departure\\" and \\"wrap up of characters\\" got cut off and ended up dragging into the 9th season.
0553385461|5.0|Like many people who have come to know Steve Hawking I have little to no actual academic training in physics but have found the subject quite interesting my entire life. I first read the original printing of A Brief History of Space and Time as a child and was immediately hooked on the subject. Since then I have read the rest of Dr. Hawking's works in addition to a number of others and while some may be more controversial or startling I have found few who are both as informative and well written as this one. His ability to break down advanced concepts in the study of space time and ultimately the existence of our universe allows for a broad audience to develop a better understanding of the debate which is currently raging in the halls of academia. This updated reprinting continues in that fashion while bringing in the tomes of new information and data collected since the original went on the shelves. For anyone interested in physics I would defiantly recommend it, if you're a little worried that it might be in over your head try his other book, the Universe in a Nutshell which tries to break these concepts down even further. Although ultimately not as detailed or informative it's a great stepping stone to A Briefer History of Time and Black Holes and Baby Universes.
0953104907|4.0|Well, I'm finishing my 14th guitar, and it all started with this book.  I learned a lot from reading it... over and over again.  I have an earlier edition than the one pictured here, so I don't know if all my comments apply to the latest edition.    I think every aspect of guitar construction is well explained.  From the design of the guitar, using Fender and Gibson history as a backdrop to describe \\"why things are the way they are\\", safety, budget, necessary tools and equipment, all steps of construction (with 3 different guitars showing a LOT of different possibilities and techniques), finishing, electronics and setup.    As the author says, there are aspects of guitar construction that could require books of their own.  I think this book is fantastic for the novice builder, and a great reference to go back to when you are more experienced, but eventually, you will want to know more about guitar finishing, wiring, engraving and inlay, etc... and you will find that this book has its limits, which is absolutely normal, considering that guitar inlay, finishing etc... fill books of their own!      The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because there are a few \\"mistakes\\" or shortcomings in certain areas.    For instance : in \\"Designing Your Own Guitar\\", the neck to body angles given for Gibson guitars are just plain wrong.  They are way too small.  Also, the fretting tables give distances fret to fret, which causes approximation.  Fret distances should always be measured directly from nut.  The \\"vintage\\" truss rods are in my humble opinion obsolete and difficult to install.  Why not give instructions on making and installing straight channeled rods?  I also have a major problem with the table mounted router being used without any kind of template guide, leaving the spinning shank to run against a plywood jig (see page 2 of the Tele-style guitar).  To me, that's asking for trouble.    There are several other things I now do differently from the book when making a guitar, but I guess that's just personal preference...    I think if you're interested in guitar construction, it's definitely the place to start.  Later, you might want to buy (and should) other books on the subject, but you will go very far with just this one to start with.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|I don't know what's happened to this fantastic artist and musician. Her piano playing used to be electric. On this record it's barely noticeable. Her crooning has become so muted, I'm tempted to scream out for her to open her damn mouth and sing. I know Ms. Krall admires Peggy Lee but Peggy was a master at using the microphone and presenting her voice on record. This is an okay album for making-out to but when played out loud on my expensive stereo, it's downright boring. Buy her tribute to Nat King Cole instead, if you want to her at her best.

0312370849|4.0|Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay didn't last long, three short sessions and it was over. Alas, am waiting for another Amazon shipment. I need my novels this year; my jones for words is at an all time high.    My major complaint with Sarah's Key is it read like a predictable screenplay. True, it painted amazing, sometimes horrific pictures, the desire of any good writer. However, reading the book instead of watching as a movie left me always wanting more, needing its pace to slow. I certainly hope de Rosnay's book, an important story by any standard, gets a quick picture deal. Wow best picture for sure!    Sarah's Key takes place in two time zones: 1942 Paris and modern era Paris, Tuscany and NYC. It involves the French deportation of 76,000 Jews during WWII and the aftermath it created, 60 years later, in three countries, on two continents.    Though de Rosnay's book was entirely too compact for me, I took the last 60 pages carefully and slowly, coming up for lots of sharp breaths because I was crying so hard. She seamlessly sewed up all the loose ends and tied a bow so tight, every Martha Stewart wannabee will forever be envious.    We celebrate Passover beginning Wednesday night. Seders will greet family and friends, wine will be served and doors left open. I will share Sarah's Key's main message this Wednesday, after the dark has come and the time for stories has begun: Zakhor, Al Tichkah. Remember. Never Forget.    Good reading to you!

The blu-ray presentation delivers audio and video quality beyond my expectations. Very recommended.

B001N18HOG|5.0|I am not writing to convince you that the original CD of Ten from 1991 is one of the greatest of all time.  The reviews for that version already speak to this fact such that I cannot contribute anything knew to the discussion.  My goal is to help you decide if you should care about the Legacy Edition of Ten.<br /><br />I am generally against it when artists do audio polishing of their previous work and essentially submit an upgrade for their fans to purchase.  However, I am willing to make an exception for one of the greatest CDs ever released.  Many of you already have the original CD, but you have probably noticed that the sound quality just isn't there when compared to other CDs that you buy today.  Disc 1 of Ten Legacy Edition solves this problem.  I found that the improvements easily discernable in comparing \\"Once\\" between the two versions.<br /><br />Disc 2 is where things get a little more interesting.  This is dubbed Ten Redux.  I listened to the first 11 songs on Disc 2 just to get a rough feel for what the changes were.  Then I transferred a playlist to my mp3 player that alternated between the two versions in order to do a more thorough comparison.  None of the songs undergo a major transformation.  You will easily recognize \\"Alive\\" as being \\"Alive\\".  If I were to characterize the difference in sound between the two versions of Ten, I'd say that Redux is bigger, rawer, and crunchier.  The changes are mostly noticeable in the guitars while the vocals have the least done to them.  I thought that these were most apparent on \\"Why Go\\", \\"Black\\", and \\"Porch\\".  Who is likely to find this interesting?  If you are someone who appreciates subtle differences, then there's a good chance you'll like Redux.  It will be similar to comparing different roasts of coffee, brands of the same wine varietal, or brands of the same style of beer.  For example, I like to compare the characteristics between two different pale ales from different brewing companies.  While they are both pale ales, they accent different characteristics.  This is the kind of approach that you need for Ten (Legacy Edition) to be worthwhile.<br /><br />I hate to even mention the additional tracks on Disc 2.  These were all outtakes from the original Ten recording sessions.  You've heard the two that are worthwhile on the Singles Soundtrack back in 1992 - \\"Breath and a Scream\\" (recorded then as \\"Breath\\") and \\"State of Love and Trust\\".  \\"Brother\\" is not bad, but it is definitely a notch below anything that actually made the cut for the original Ten.  Further, if it or the other remaining tracks were all that, they would have been released previously.<br /><br />So, I think that Ten (Legacy Edition) is worth having, and I hope that I've given you something to help you decide if you agree.<br /><br />Download this:  Black (Redux Version)hey accent different characteristics.

B001TK3XO0|4.0|I enjoyed the Kite Runner more. However this was still well written This book was a bit too heavy at times and some of the content was really disturbing.  I don't think I have ever hated a character in a book as much as Rasheed, but that shows that talent of the author's writing. I read this for a book club and got behind in the reading and wound up having to read half of it about, in one sitting. I would not recommend that. The book gets a bit to heavy and intense at times, so it better to read it in small doses. But overall a well written book, and I would read more from this author once he publishes again.

B000MG1YC0|1.0|Don't get me wrong -- I loved all the Sirenia albums. I loved Morten in Tristania (another band that went the same direction as Sirenia on their last release)... but this is POP. It is not metal, it is not even gothic, it's POP. No violins, no Morten doing any vocals at all (and he has a great singing voice, not just his growls). This is reminding me an awful lot of another band that went down this road -- a band called Theatre of Tragedy.<br /><br />If you like the old albums, don't bother buying this one. You can listen to 30 seconds of one song on this album and understand why. That's really all you need, because every song sounds exactly the same.<br /><br />That's all we needed, another failure in gothic metal.
B0013D8LKO|5.0|\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is nothing short of a true artistic masterwork from the late, great extraordinary Stanley Kubrick. It is a subtle film, yet so opulent and rich...complex and beautiful in its overt simplicity and less recognizable complexity.  What does it teach and tell us about men, women, and the human condition? Maybe many things and perhaps nothing at all.  None really matters here as we interpret as needed and are entertained immensely all the same.  Cruise and Kidman are surprisingly well cast in this film , both turning in wonderful performances and obviously enjoying their roles respectively.  Dr. Harford (Cruise) as your successful \\"everyman\\"..inherently riddled with human weakness that so often plagues the male.  And Alice (Kidman), the stronger female counterpart figure, the possessor who inherently also possesses tremendous needs. This dynamic sparks both a complex and fascinating friction.  I would not be a dignified Kubrick fan if I didn't put a word in about the brilliant lighting and cinematography...as with other Kubrick films, they are extraordinary.  We are treated to the soft, almost opaque lighting that evokes a dreamlike quality, symbiotic with major elements of the storyline. As opposed to the mostly white lighting seen in \\"Clockwork\\", \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" promulgates color!..yet does so in soft, sensitive and consistent Christmas themed fashion.  Perhaps one of the favorite moments was the flirtatious dance between Alice (Kidman) and Sandor Svavost (played by the brilliant Sky Dumont).  There are the splendid aromas of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", \\"The Shining\\" and \\"the Wickerman\\" here...all classics in their own right. And of course, the score! Kubrick had a unique talent for sourcing music that creates a perfect symbiosis for his films. Jocelyn Pook's haunting songs accent the film perfectly...especially the mesmerizing piece that we hear during the ceremony in the Mansion!..this piece of music sent chills straight up my spine.  \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is layered and eternally deep...like your favorite glass of Merlot or classic Poem. All together, this film is an amazing and unforgettable experience.ayered and eternally deep...like your favorite glass of Merlot or classic Poem.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|A sequel was inevitable after the (partial) cliffhanger ending of the 1999 blockbuster \\"The Matrix\\".     The second-part in the the Wachowski brothers groundbreaking vision, \\"Reloaded\\" makes sure it has the signature fight-scenes from the first Matrix and then some.    The first part of the film starts out just a bit too fast, lacking a bit of info that could have come across more clearly. After a short amount of time it becomes apparent that many months have past since the first Matrix film, and Neo has fully developed into a savior figure for the 'resistance', the people of Zion.    As the story shifts to allow for the entrance of new characters to the story, a feeling of the magnitude of the entire human/machine battle comes to light. The people of Zion are just waiting out until their impending doom and all of their hopes lay squarely on the shoulders of Neo, the savior that they believe will end the war.     Therein lies the main strength of \\"Reloaded\\". The new characters to the story bring a certain human aspect, not as much present in the first installment. When the cool, stylized, slo-mo style is not present, there is a certain sense that these people are only human, preparing to fight a force far beyond them.     The film spends a large amount of time on the now apparent villain, the Morovingian. A french speaking computer-program who spends his time messing with people in his high-class restaurant with his rejected wife Persephone.     And there, lies the movies biggest problem. \\"Reloaded\\" is highly publicized as a two-part deal, to get the entire thing, the second part (or third, whatever you want to call it) \\"Revolutions\\" must be seen. Why is this a problem? Because the film itself is aware that no matter how many times the characters say \\"it ends tonight\\" the audience knows it isn't actually going to end until the next movie. There is a rather large lack of drama to the 'climax', mostly because of the focus on the Morovingian, and not on the machines. Now this would be fine if it weren't for the scripts unwavering insistence on pretending there's a climax when there doesn't need to be one.      Reloaded does regain it's bearings toward the end though, although somewhat depressing it ends with a key revelation to the story and ends with enough left open for the third-installment to be a must-see.    8/10 stars
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|With AIEW out now, it made me think about when My December came out (I may of reviewed when it first came out, I don't remember now.) I think the reason this album did not do as good was the record company did not give it the support it deserved, and as others pointed out what was clive thinking when he said there would be no hits. How I feel, Can I have  Kiss, Sober, all would of made fine radio singles, even sober with being so slow but it is an amazing song that grabs you.  This album shows her talent the most from her singing to her songwriting talents.  And you can here the emotion in her voice when she sings, essp with Irvine, I wanted to cry the first time I heard that song. I connected on this album on a deep personal level it was almost scary. This album is way underrated. It is is a true gem, that her most loyal fans will always appreciate.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith Urban let's us see his musical brilliance and his joyful heart in this amazing album.  This album will take you on an incredible journey from teaching you how to have a braver heart and learning to trust in love, to finding deep, deep gratitude for your life.  Keith's vocal performances are immpeccable in this album and his guitar playing will leave you breathless.  Once again, Keith shows us his extraordinary gift for blending instruments until they come together in perfect harmony. \\"If Ever I Could Love\\" will make you believe that you can love again after someone has broken your heart.  \\"My Heart is Open\\" will fill you with courage to love and the faith to believe that it will last. There are no words beautiful enough to describe \\"Thank You\\", you just have to hear it for yourself to understand it.  In every aspect this album is extraordinary.  You owe it to your self to get it and really listen to it from start to finish.  You will love the journey.
0439023483|5.0|All I have to say about this book is \\"WOW!\\".  It was realistic, and it was a joy to read. It combined romance, and action into one action packed novel full of twists and turns. I seriously reccomend it to anybody.
B00008972S|4.0|Let me state up front that I adore this film and, having grown up in New York City, and lived for years on the west side of Manhattan where the film's now iconic opening sequences were shot, I feel a special connection with it.    Groundbreaking in its transfer from the Broadway stage, and in its production values and design, featuring (among other virtues) a matchless score by Leonard Bernstein, brilliant choreography by Jerome Robbins, costumes by Irene Sharaff, and a fantastic supporting cast, the film is a treat for the eye and ear.    And, having said all that. . .the film also has some huge flaws that leave it disappointingly short of the greatness for which it was surely originally destined.    The greatest of these flaws is its two leads, Natalie Wood as the Latina Maria, and Richard Beymer as her Anglo love, Tony.  The very beautiful Wood gave it a solid, professional try, and was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, but she was, although only 25, already a bit too glamorous and too much the Hollywood star to persuade as the slum-dwelling, fresh-to-the-world, dewey Maria.  Her Spanish accent slips noticeably in several places, and she could not sing; that stalwart of non-singing actresses in the 1950s and 1960s, Marnie Nixon, was brought in to dub Wood's songs, further depriving Wood's performance of the somewhat stronger gestalt it needed. Wood had some nice moments, but the performance overall is not as strong as it needed to be.    Wood, of course, got the role because the Mirisch studio wanted a bona fide star, and Carol Lawrence, who created the role of Maria on Broadway, was felt to be neither sufficiently well-known nor glamorous enough to carry the film - they wanted a Big Star.  This is a great shame, for while not the beauty that Wood was, Lawrence was nonetheless very pretty and could sing her own songs - most of all, according to those who saw her in the original Broadway production, she was deeply moving in the role, which is more than can be said of Wood's merely adequate performance.    However, the failure to connect deeply enough with the part was only partly Wood's fault; some portion of her failure must be laid at the feet of the truly abysmal leading man she was given to play to, Richard Beymer.  That Wood responded as much as she did to Beymer says something complimentary about her abilities. Many rumors abound about how and why, in a film this important, with this charismatic a leading lady, so lousy an actor was cast in the role of Tony.  Neither a particularly good singer, nor particularly good-looking, and without a fraction of Wood's candlepower, Beymer was remarkably weak and looked like an understudy posing with a leading lady - not a single spark of real chemistry was struck.  His unsuitability, the lopsided match, undercut Wood, I think, and made it impossible for her to reach full stature in the role.  What the producers and directors and Mirisch studio heads were thinking in casting Beymer is beyond this reviewer's comprehension.    It is not surprising that neither Wood nor Beymer won Oscars for their performances (although Wood was nominated), while two of the supporting leads, the riveting George Chakiris and Rita Moreno, were not only nominated for, but won Oscars for their roles as Bernardo and Anita.  Chakiris's Oscar is particularly noteworthy, for he had been recruited for the role of Bernardo from the London stage production, where he had been playing Bernardo's arch-enemy, Riff (played in the film by the energetic and insouciant Russ Tamblyn).  One would never know from Chakiris's intense, bitter, and gorgeously danced performance as Bernardo, that he was fresh from playing his opposite number.  Moreno was equally unforgettable as Anita.    The film's other, and less glaring flaw, is its somewhat arch \\"beat\\" script, with phrases like \\"Daddy-O\\" sprinkled liberally throughout - this has dated the film in an unfortunate way, although its script was never going to be the primary reason to watch this film.  And it must be said that the slum environment here is more picturesque than anything else - you can see the difference immediately if you watch a film like \\"On the Waterfront\\" with its gritty presentation of the woeful poverty of the New York waterfront.  In this sense, West Side Story hasn't held up well.    As I said, even with these exceptions, the film retains a warm and affectionate place in my heart.  I was far too young to catch the original Broadway play, but fell quickly under the film's spell later on in life.  The supporting cast is brilliant, with the aforementioned Chakiris and Moreno, in particular, pulling out memorable performances on both the dramatic and musical levels.  Russ Tamblyn, an acrobat rather than a dancer, holds his own as Riff among the very fine group of trained dancers that Robbins gathered (a feat Tamblyn also pulled off in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, where he was also surrounded by top notch dancers).  Eliot Feld, who plays Baby John in the film, went on to found his own successful modern ballet company and is now rather a Grand Old Man of the ballet scene.  Many of the dancers in the film were from the Broadway cast.    The gang members glower and dance and sing up a storm - the character actors playing police Lt. Schrank (Simon Oakes), Officer Krupke, and Doc the candy store owner (the wonderful Ned Glass, who makes the most of every moment onscreen) - all serve up a delectable feast of melody, movement, color, and strong characterizations.  Steven Sondheim's lyrics have become immortal (\\"Maria\\" has probably been sung more often than any song in modern Broadway history), and Irene Sharaff's costumes are divine, especially those for the dance at the gym.    As for those big numbers: that amazing opening sequence, the dance at the gym, the rooftop dance by the Sharks, the dance in the garage for the Jets - you'll go a very, very long way to surpass their propulsive, irresistable spirit and beauty.  Thefilm is worth your time and money just for those sequences, and for the supporting performances.  West Side Story won ten Oscars, including Best Picture.    Thus, for this ex-New Yorker, even with its flaws, West Side Story remains the greatest of the musicals of the post-Rodgers and Hammerstein era.

B001JQTSG6|5.0|Watching a black and white movie in blu ray is unbelievable.  This is crisp, sharp and De Niro is as good as it gets.
B00000K413|5.0|Once in awhile I come in and write a review on a cd when inspired. This cd 'The Hurting' still remains one of my top 5 cd's of all time. I'm prompted to write this review because of Adam Lambert's brilliant rendition of Mad World tonight. I often don't write reviews on cd's from the past because...I figure anybody from 'my generation' wouldn't be interested. But here, a guy from a new generation is introducing his young audience to a song by Tears For Fears. There are probably many people tonight looking up this song and wondering 'what was that?'. I'll tell you what it was...'Mad World', from the Hurting, one of the best cd's of all time really. TFF aren't one of my favorite bands but this disc stands out from a million. Lyrically and musically, the music captivates and transcends a person into a strange 'think mode'. I don't need to review it song by song because it's been done in other reviews and very accurately. Mad World, Watch Me Bleed, The Hurting, Start of the Breakdown, Memories Fade and Pale Shelter....all 100% brilliant brilliant brilliant. So if the new generation doesn't think it's 'uncool' to invest some time and listening for the 80's, this is surely not one to miss. Songs From The Big Chair is also a good investment with brilliant songs... but it didn't all flow together nearly with the perfection that The Hurting did. Don't think twice...buy them both for the full effect.

1401216676|5.0|This is a GREAT story line - but I can't believe the pricing.  I found that this ENTIRE story-line is included in the \\"DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore\\" that is available on Amazon for 1 more dollar.  It also includes other Batman stories, a couple Superman stories, a couple Green Lantern stories, and a few others.  It is a Steal of a deal compared to this - about 5X as many pages for 1 dollar more.  Granted - it has a different cover since that one is a compendium of other stories, they are all from Alan Moore.
B001LMU182|5.0|not the original voice over im used to, but thats a minor detail. the actual transfer, the picture quality is amazing.
B0012Q732O|2.0|it was a very strange movie . it was too long and kinda got annoying but at the same time i couldnt stop watching it. it was terribly long but my eyes were glued 2 the screen. my advice is dont watch this movie unless your xtremely bored
B001EYU1VO|3.0|A nice well-rounded joystick. Dual-throttles for multiple engine control (Flight Sim, etc.), adjustable grip angles, numerous buttons. My only issue with it is one of the buttons came off quite easily, and it has a physical deadzone, even when the base is tightened.
B000YABYLA|5.0|For many people, Juno's pregnancy is the main theme of this movie. For myself though, I found myself comparing it to a novel by Philip K. Dick -- Confessions of a Crap Artist.    In that book, the main character is extremely odd (a tire-regroover that believes that sunlight has weight, the earth is hollow and the world will end on April 23rd, to name a few). What made that book interesting is how Philip K. Dick compared his eccentric main character to a \\"normal\\" couple going through a divorce. In the end, one saw that sometimes \\"eccentric\\" is not so bad after all and that sometimes it is the \\"normal\\" people who are messed up the most.     Going back to Juno, we have a similar setup. Juno is the eccentric teenager and some \\"normal adults\\" believe that she has some growing up to do.  But finally, towards the end of the movie, we see that it is Juno that displays some of the more adult-like qualities.     I honestly wasn't expecting too much of this movie when I first saw it (a movie about pregnancy isn't the usual \\"guy\\" fare), but it drew me in with its excellent characters and moral dilemmas.

B000CNE092|3.0|I love the songs in there, the cute, romantic love story, and the interesting conversations.  But the Rasputin-related parts are kind of nasty-scary.  I mean bad person supposed to be scary, but this is a bit over necessary in most part.  It's more as nasty than scary.
0765342294|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK. It is such a great read. Fun, interesting, thought-provoking, tense, blah, blah, blah.     The plot is original and fluid. The characters are real - there is both good and bad in all of them (and us). Very well written.     I find myself re-reading this every year or so and each time I think \\"wow, what a great book\\", but each time I'm drawn to a different part or understand it in a way I hadn't previously.     Oh, how I wish they'd make this into a movie. But they'd butcher it so maybe I don't want them to.     I think I might go read this again.     December 2008 -I read it again. Does that make me a nerd?    *taken from my review at goodreads

B00021R7CG|4.0|First, I am not qualified to evaluate how realistic this scenario was at the time this film was made.  I do not have the necessary political and military background.      Overall, the film is very grim (as it should be).  The scenario is that a limited nuclear exchange takes place very early on in the film due to a series of mistakes/miscommunications/misperceptions on both sides.  Most of the film is centered around avoiding a full nuclear exchange.  Even if successful, the damage and death toll is still tremendous.      Some other reviewers have criticized the dialogue and that gets to the point of this review.  So far over 60 people have reviewed this film but nobody has mentioned the most memorable line in the film:    \\"Cut the head off of the Communist Chicken!\\"      This is perhaps the most hilarious line I have ever heard in a movie!  The context of this line is that it summarizes/concludes a colonel's plan to kill the soviet leadership with a nuclear warhead.  The line is delivered in a firm and serious manner which makes it even funnier.  I have to conclude that the film director inserted this line into the dialogue as a form of black humor.      The rest of this film is 100% serious.      Overall I enjoyed the film, I thought it was decent.  Perhaps the film is not realistic - I will leave that for those with a military background to evaluate.  However, for the typical person on the street's perspective, the film is believable.
1596912863|5.0|I loved this book! It was funny (like laugh out loud) and I sat with a big dopey grin on my face through most of it. Very clever and just plain fun. I loved trying to figure out the various characters and plots and how they related to the original Austen works.     It did some kissing and such, but nothing untoward.     I highly recommend this book to any Jane Austen fan. I love it so much I kept the copy my sister 'lent' to me. Sorry, Amy - your new copy is in the mail.

B0006GQMC8|5.0|Very loosely based on a true story, Death Hunt is a great \\"chase\\" film in the category of Naked Prey of many years ago. And you can't go far wrong with any film that stars Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson.  At times the film is a bit contrived and predictable, but it's worth seeing by any fan of chase films and fans of these two great actors.
B0000025YL|5.0|Accept guitarist Wolf Hoffmann, along with with Akira Takasaki of Loudness, has written some of the best metal riffs ever. When Accept was on top of their game, like they are on this disc, few metal bands, if any, can touch them. These guys write great songs, it's not all about loud thrashing, these guys write classic metal songs and deliver them with the power to back them up.<br />I have loved the track Fast As A Shark for as long as I can remember. When Udo Dirkschneider lets out that scream it's time to follow the band or get the heck out of the way. Stefan Kaufman's double bass drums are fast and furious! Not for the faint of heart. This is metal for men by men. I've seen these guys twice and they are the real deal. Get this disc already!!<br />[...]
B001PA0FFO|2.0|I admit I'm not a sophisticated movie critic.  Far from it.  But I know an unfulfilling movie when I see one.  Although the acting was very well done, the ending of this movie was empty and left too much to the imagination.  I don't mind books or movies that allow me to use some thought to fill in the blanks and decide for myself what happened, but this movie made me work way too hard.  It left almost everything unanswered.  At the end, I wanted some resolution, something that wrapped up the plot and gave meaning to what happened before, but instead it left it all up to the viewer to decide.  It left me thinking, \\"was that it?\\"
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I had seen all 3 films and really enjoyed them. I was a bit hesitant to purchase this but am glad I did. The commentary with Ken Wilber and Cornel West is really fantasitic  !!! I had no idea that this film was this rich !! Many of us out there prefer the first film to the others . After listening to the commentary, the film takes on a much richer interpretation and now I see all 3 films as being equally important. Enjoy !!!
B001PPLIEG|3.0|James Bond is a spoof of the intelligence industry. (This is why spoofs of James Bond are so unfunny - absurdity prevails when one makes a spoof of a spoof.) QoS falls short of the genre and so unfortunately fails as a James Bond movie. The story line is as confusing as the initial car scenes, where it cannot be determined what is happening. So it could not make up for its lack of spoofiness by entertaining through a well-told story.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|It's the sound stupid, April 8, 2009  By     Pliny The Younger \\"Pliny\\" (NYC) - See all my reviews  I listened to this last night several times. My frustration was not with the music. Diana is superb and her band is aces all the way. The arrangements, what I can hear of them anyway, are excellent.     I think the issue here is the sound, not the performance. The mixes sound weird to me, especially coming from a guy as talented as Al Schmidt. This is a Bossa album, albeit a laid back Bossa record. But it's hard to hear the elements of the mix in a way that draws you in. The mixes are very homogenized with (to my ears) way too much reverb. Compare the sound of this record to The Look of Love. No comparison even though its by the same production team.     The great Brazilian percussionist Paulhino DaCosta is listed in the credits but I can barely hear him on the record....he gets lost in the swirl along with all the other players. Anthony Wilson's acoustic guitar gets buried in the mix as well. When I concentrate and really work to dig elements out of the mix it becomes clear that the performances (including Diana's) are wonderful. But no one should have to work this hard to hear the performance. Speaking of Diana, I think Al has done a much better job in the past recording her lovely voice. He has her mixed WAY in front for this one, to the point where she sounds separate from the rest of the music.     As I read the other comments here, many lukewarm, I think that reaction has more to do with the bland and boring sound of the record and not the performance. It's easy to get these things confused and blame the artist for problems which are production related.     Just my opinion.

The score is the songs and sound clips from the movie, the soundtrack is the edited and fine tuned versions of the songs in the movie plus some songs inspired by it.
B001TK3XO0|5.0|Khaled Hosseini proved himself to be a great writer. Some reviewers did not like his style of portraying things in detail...small things in great details...to me that is the real art of writing. That's what differentiates a good novel from a news article or a documentary. People who are not very familiar with ordinary peoples' lives in 'that part of the world' can get a good sense of what a woman's (and girl's)status is in strict Islamic societies. How poverty and war (after war) destroys human life and a society. Afghanistan's problems are not just Afghanis' problems. They are world's problems and world powers should do much more to help end this humanitarian crisis. Talibanization (and Wahabi brand of Strict Islam) is spreading very fast. It is gripping Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, Bangladesh and many African countries at an alarming pace. Bush-Cheney idiotic policies and invasion of Iraq (and killing millions of Muslims there) have poved fuel to the fire of Jihadism and Talbanization. Will America ever be able to see beyond her short-sighted and selfish goals and objectives? Does the modern world really have a plan-B to defeat Islamic Extremism and Jihadism? We all know now that wars and invasions have made the things only worse. It's not the question of saving Iraq, Pakistan or Afghanistan...It seriously is the question of saving us all...before it's too late.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson has become one of my favorite artists.  Perhaps it's my mellowing with age, but I find his music bothcalms and cheers me up. I enjoy music that I can sing along with- at least a little bit and after a couple of listens to his CDs I usually can.<br /><br />If you're someone who needs deep meaning in your music or artists that are obviously troubled, then Jack Johnson is probably not for you. However, if you want a CD that you can throw in and leave in for a while, I think he's the answer.<br /><br />I do like all of his CDs, but this is my favorite. I do have to add that I may be biased on this one as it was one of the CDs we brought to the hospital to play when I had my son, so it has some major sentimental value to me. That said, we never felt the need to change it for the many hours we were in the delivery room and it was a perfect mix of happy and soothing for the occasion!
0312360266|5.0|I REALLY LOVED the Twilight Saga so I wanted to find something similar.  A love story with vampires.  So I researched many series and came across the House of Night series by P.C. Cast.  I really liked Marked and now I am on Betrayed.  It's a younger book but I like it.
B001TOVZYQ|5.0|Donnie Yen's crowning achievement?  Very possibly.  I've always thought Donnie was the paragon of martial artistry on film... I've also admired how he remains relatively true to the style of the hero in question, if that is relevant (See Iron Monkey, for example.).  The story of Ip Man is similar to that of Jet Li's \\"Fearless\\", but to be honest, Ip Man the movie is better.<br /><br />The action scenes are works of art.  Donnie portrays Wing Chun with a good degree of authenticity to the style (considering, of course, the unavoidable dramatic, cinematic flair).  Donnie's technique is crisp, rapid, accurate, potent.  The choreography is splendid.  There is no significant wire work here, just economical, brutally efficient combat-- which is what Wing Chun is about.  Truly homage to the spirit of Wing Chun.  As a practitioner of Wing Chun, I can truly point to this movie, show it to my friends who don't know, and say: \\"That's Wing Chun, that's what it's about.\\"<br /><br />The story of Ip Man works well with Donnie's acting style.  Ip Man is a martial artist conflicted in his priorities-- reluctant to teach, fascinated with the art, struggling to balance family responsibilities with that of friends and comrades who get in trouble.  Forced by the Japanese occupation, near destitute, to feed his family and defend the honor of his friends, he finally fights and teaches to defend the honor of China, as well as uphold the spirit of kung fu.<br /><br />I was a little nervous watching this film-- someone has posted virtually all the fight scenes on YouTube.  I was afraid that after seeing them, that this film would be a disappointment.  I had already seen the fight scenes... and kung fu flicks aren't exactly award-winning drama.  But Ip Man didn't disappoint.  The story was still compelling, interesting.  The fight scenes in context were more delicious than on YouTube (and the large widescreen, framerate and resolution upgrades didn't hurt!)  Donnie shows appropriate remorse, conflict, passion, and resolve.  It is understated-- like Donnie really tried to be true to the historical Ip Man.  It works well, and shows me that Donnie has really matured as an actor.  Hey, I know Donnie is never going to win an Oscar for his acting.. but you know what?  He really shows some maturity as a professional here.<br /><br />This double disc edition is nice.  Lots of special features-- deleted scenes, interviews, production trailers, photo galleries.  I got it based on other reviews that the single disc version had dubbing issues.  I watched the Cantonese version (options for Mandarin also on this disc) with English subtitles... and if it was dubbed, I couldn't tell.  I don't speak Chinese, so can't tell you how accurate it was, but it sounded fairly authentic, and I hear enough Chinese to be able to say that much, at least.  The subtitles had one or two spelling errors, but minimal grammatical problems.  It seemed fairly true to the story's intent, was easy to follow, and kept me interested.<br /><br />I'm biased.  I'm a Wing Chun practitioner and a Donnie Yen fan-- but I must say this has superseded \\"Hero\\" as my favorite kung fu flick.  It's at least in the same class as Jackie Chan's \\"Drunken Master\\" for unique, superlative martial arts.  The story and acting are good-- and while the storyline is a variation on a cliched theme for kung fu flicks, this one is well done.  If you enjoyed \\"Fearless\\" (I would rate it three stars)-- you'll like Ip Man so much better, I think.  If you practice Wing Chun (2 million worldwide!)-- you have to own this movie.  If you like Donnie Yen-- this might be his masterpiece.<br /><br />Addendum: In deference to W. Kim's excellent review above, I took the liberty of renting and watching both movies \\"Warriors Two\\" and \\"Prodigal Son\\" as other movies that accurately depict Wing Chun as a martial art.  Both movies are your stereotypical Hong King B-movie \\"Wuxi\\" style soap opera kung fu flick.  Warriors Two is better storywise-- Prodigal Son, at least via the subtitles, didn't make sense much of the time.  Ah, but the reason why we watch such movies: \\"Prodigal Son\\" was the more accurate Wing Chun movie.  It depicts Wing Chun through the \\"Wuxi\\" B-movie filter, but has a lot of fairly sound representation given this understanding.  Prodigal Son was Wing Chun with lots of non-Wing Chun thrown in, or Wing Chun in a deep cat stance, or with some Longfist twist and things like that.  Just flashy show.  All in all, neither depicts Wing Chun as \\"Ip Man\\" does-- Ip Man is not stylized, although it, of course, depicts Wing Chun in an idealized way-- that is, the ultimate master of Wing Chun does every technique perfect and has every technique work perfectly.  But \\"Ip Man\\" is the only movie I have (still) seen that I can point to as \\"authentic\\" Wing Chun.n't make sense much of the time.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|The best DVD concert I've ever watched.  So many fabulous guest singers playing with the group made this even better.  The band still sounds better then ever.
B000000OMB|5.0|Asia was formed following the dissolution of the progressive rock bands Yes, U.K., and Emerson, Lake and Palmer.<br />Steve Howe (guitar) had come from Yes, bringing Geoff Downes (keyboards) with him.<br />John Wetton (bass / vocals) had tenured with U.K., and previously King Crimson, while Carl Palmer (drums) was 1/3 of E.L.P.<br /><br />The quartet set out to make an album that drew from their progressive backgrounds, but with shorter song-oriented material.<br />What they came up with was no less than captured lightning...<br /><br />  The Tracks:<br /><br />\\"Heat of the Moment\\" was not only the album opener, but was the album's hit single.<br />Steve's power chords open the song, followed by the intro of John's vocal, Carl's \\"Phil Spector-ish\\" bass drum and popped snare. The catchy chorus and second verse give way to a minor- chorded middle, featuring Geoff's keys and Steve on the Koto,giving it a far east feel. Another verse and chorus set the stage for Steve's solo which goes into the fade.

The song is credited to the group, and with good reason. It's an amazing performance. Hearing is believing.<br /><br />\\"Wildest Dreams\\" is the closest thing the group did to a classic prog-rock piece. Steve's solo goes from one end of his Gibson ES-Artist to the other at very high speed, and Carl's drum solo is jaw-dropping.<br /><br />\\"Without You\\" is the requisite power ballad, but some key & tempo changes keep it interesting.<br /><br />\\"Cutting it Fine\\" acts lie a straight rock number, until the coda (known as Geoff's bolero), which is a keyboard tour-de-force.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes The Feeling\\" is a straight rock and roll pot boiler that's more interesting in the middle and Steve plays a cool solo and a funky rhythm part.<br /><br />John's lead vocals are strong throughout, and the band is incredibly tight.<br />Given all their backgrounds, one would expect no less.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|I throughly enjoyed this movie. It's the best movie I've seen in a while, and I like true story movies. I didn't give it 5 stars cause it's not the best I've ever seen, but I couldn't really find anything bad about about it. Too all who like those kind of War/true story/action/western movies this is a good one, even though it's techincally not a western, but it kinds gives you that feeling. Check it out, I definitly recommend it.
B001A3AA0G|5.0|I love this CD. I stumbled upon one of their videos and have been a fan ever since. They played locally in D.C. last year and the concert is online over at NPR if interested. Real mellow sound that I really have a hard time taking off my iPod. I keep the CDs in my car and have raved about them to everyone at work and at home. People are really getting sick of it. (my proselytizing not the music!) I don't think you will be disappointed. Enjoy!
0316776963|3.0|(Three-and-a-half stars)    Sedaris has a death-grip on popular creative nonfiction. This is refreshing, in a way. Looking at the Grishams and Pattersons that dominate popular fiction, it's nice to see that a collection of personal essays can succeed without similar melodrama and weak writing. Sedaris tells stories of irreverence in an irreverent way, giving us the humor and sparing us the saccharine when writing about his childhood speech impediment, putting animals to sleep, or being addicted to drugs whilst hopelessly tangled up in Raleigh's performance art scene.    That's not to say the collection is hilarious. Sure, Sedaris gives us humor, but it's on the page funny. It's funny like Martin Amis or a Monty Python script. It's all very clever, with the randomness arranged so that it looks like it wasn't arranged. So, while Sedaris really is a funny guy, I don't remember laughing while reading the book.    I said that the essays succeed without the melodrama and weak writing of popular fiction, a true statement, for sure. However, the essays don't always escape some form of over-the-top and flawed writing. The reason my chuckles remained internal--and my main complaint about Sedaris--is the visibility of his craft.    There's a lot to be gleaned from studying the essays found in Me Talk Pretty One Day: how to set up a forward-moving story and write it using language and images that go just far enough without being obtrusive. This collection is such an easy read because the essays are, essentially, all the same. Some are better than others (\\"Twelve Moments In the Life of an Artist\\" and \\"Go Carolina\\" are both very entertaining and well-written), but it's Creative Nonfiction 101. I'm not saying that everything needs to be dense and literary--to darken the humor and thicken the craft here would surely segregate the audience, and I imagine that only a portion of Sedaris fans would enjoy something like Hot Water Music or The Stranger. Books like that attack something visceral in the reader as opposed to merely giving him/her a quirky little read that might press lightly on the skin.    This is the third collection of essays I've read by David Sedaris (the other two being Holidays On Ice and Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim), and even if he seems to be getting more cookie-cutter as I look at his work chronologically, the essays in Me Talk Pretty One Day are worth a read. The second half of the book in particular is very well done, and when he has a strong tie from one story to the next he gives himself more room to develop an idea. This act of trying to tell us something other than a good story is when he's at his best. That said, these are often good stories and nothing more, which isn't too bad of a backhanded complement if you think about it.

B000001ES9|5.0|This is such an awesome, solid, classic hard rocking debut album from these Canadian progressive/classic rock legends. [...] and I've been listening to it alot ever since. Released in March of 1974, Rush's self titled debut album (which was also self-produced by the band themselves) features a more blues-inspired hard rock/heavy metal sound similar of many of the popular rock bands emerging from Britain (including Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) earlier in the decade. The Zeppelin influences are definately present on many of the song on here. Please keep in mind, that this is the only Rush album to feature the band's original drummer John Rutsey who left the band afterwards due to problems with diabetes, and he would be replaced by drum legend and master lyricist Neil Peart who would debut on the band's 1975 release \\"Fly By Night\\", and since then, Rush would go on to become the band that we all know and love. Although not as great as Peart, Rutsey delivers a nice, solid, all around performance behind the drums, and they really flow good with the music. Alex Lifeson's guitar playing is just freakin awesome on here. You can definately hear the Jimmy Page influences in his raw, heavy, in your face riffs and awesome solos. I really like the raw, heavy tone in his guitar as well. And of course topping all that is lead singer and bassist Geddy Lee's awesome and unique high ranged vocals and sick basslines, I mean they're just sick.<br /><br />There are only eight songs on the album. \\"Working Man\\" is definately one of my favorites on here, and it's also the best known song on here as well. The riffing is very heavy and very Sabbath like, and there's also lots of sick, crazy soloing by Alex as well. There are some other great worthy mentionables including the fierce and fiery Zeppelin-esque opener \\"Finding My Way\\" which showcases Geddy's Robert Plant-esque singing vocals especially when he goes \\"OOH YEAH, OOH YEAH\\". Alex's guitar riffs are just fantastic and there's a sweet, rockin solo around 3:13 as well. Track three \\"Take a Friend\\" is another awesome, catchy Zeppelin-esque rocker that is highighted by a nice chorus, and more nice guitarwork by Alex, while \\"Here Again\\" is a fantastic bluesy ballad which features an awesome David Gilmour-ish guitar solo by Alex. Track five \\"What You're Doing is my personal favorite song on the album, and an extremely addicting tune that features catchy Zeppelin/Sabbath like riffing and more wicked soloing by Alex, as well as some great vocals by Geddy, and tight, pounding drums by Rutsey, and \\"Before and After\\" is another great song that starts off with a nice, mellow acoustic guitar intro before going into hard rocking territory around 2:17 and so on. Honestly, there's not even one bad song on here, they're all great and fun to rock out to. Anyways, this is a great, solid, classic rock debut from Rush, and yeah I know it's a lot different from their future classics such as 2112, Fly By Night, A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, and Moving Pictures, but this is still an awesome album nonetheless. I highly recommend this album if you're already a Rush fan, and classic rock fans will also dig this as well. Enjoy!!n solo around 3:13 as well.

B001SN78JO|4.0|Well, the previews looked kinda dumb.<br />The idea seemed kinda cheesy.<br />But this is an excellent feel-good movie with a message...<br />Start saying YES!<br /><br />Who woulda thunk it?  Jim Carrey can actually still be funny.  This movie is very clever, original, and genuine.  Unlike most current comedies, it doesn't rely on foul language, sex & drug references, or sick, gross-out shocks for a cheap laugh.  It pushes some profound buttons and will make many people wonder...are you living life to the fullest?<br /><br />Carrey plays a loan officer named Carl.  At work he's gotten into the habit of telling applicants \\"No\\".  Plus, due to the bad ending of a relationship, that negativity has rubbed off into all aspects of his life.<br />Until he's talked into attending a YES seminar.  Finally, he starts experiencing life.<br /><br />Whether it's pulling an all-nighter at the bars, getting in a fight, learning to play guitar, or giving in to the elderly neighbor's sexual advances, it's quite an experience.  Good or bad, nothing is worse than wasting your life away.<br /><br />YES MAN illustrates the importance of being spontaneous.  It is so easy in our daily lives to get stuck in the same routines.  It's actually sad to think about, pathetic really.  This movie has an undeniable energy without being too heavy-handed.  Highly recommended.

B00004CZPF|5.0|First, pay attention: this is a \\"REGION TWO\\" disc, which won't play on Region One coded (North America) DVD players.  My solution was to get a region-free player (yes, just for this disc, although I am ordering more Region Two's from Europe now) from OPPO.  Excellent universal (including DVD-Audio and SACD) disc players for very reasonable prices, by the way.  Not cheap, but they perform above their price.    So, on to the DVD content!  I held a \\"Mike Oldfield Concert Event\\" in my home for the first viewing, and it was attended by long-time fans (such as myself) and people who had never heard of him.  Everyone's jaws dropped from start to finish.  The sound is great, and the on-stage performances are enthralling.  The video isn't the best, though it is very good on TBII, less so on TBIII.    By the way, many (though NOT all) DVD players can have their regional coding eliminated by the user - just Google your player's make and model number, followed by \\"region free\\", to see if you can find instructions - usually by using your remote control keypad.
B000002ADT|5.0|For some reason this album/CD had escaped my attention. I suppose it was because I wasn't that interested in jazz in my teen and young adult years, although I had purchased Miles Davis's \\"Bitches Brew\\" and owned a few other jazz albums. It's probably best that I found this CD, after reading glowing reviews about it the past few months on the 50th anniversary of its release, because I can now appreciate and savor it. There is an understated mood in this CD that simply grows on you. I've played the CD many times, and I always hear something that catches my attention. This CD certainly lived up, and exceeded, expectations.

0393057658|3.0|Let me start with a disclaimer: I'm not a fan of baseball. I don't even understand all the rules of the game.<br /><br />This book however, is not only about baseball. Even though it has a few chapters that were, for me, a bit hard to follow because of the technical jargon and game details, it still was an enjoyable and instructive reading experience. If you approach the book simply as a an account of what goes on off the baseball field, such as drafting new players, negotiating contracts, etc... you'd be missing the gist of it. You'd be even missing as well it if you read it just as a historical account of a bunch of players or teams.<br /><br />I believe the main idea of the book is about the opportunities that are inherently present in an inefficient market for anyone who can can grasp these inefficiencies, and approach them with rationality.  It's invariably the most critical, but least explicit, factor in any successful business venture to address some inefficiency in the market, often illustrated in general economic terms as creating supply where there is unsatisfied demand. And this book shows how it turned out to be a critical factor in managing a baseball team as well. In particular, when drafting new skills, looking for undervalued players is the equivalent to looking for undervalued companies in the stock market.<br /><br />Michael Lewis illustrates in this book how Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's, has decided to challenge the traditional approach to drafting in baseball, which is largely based on cursory observations by the team's scouts as they travel the country trying to catch potential players playing one or two games at most, and which inevitably leads to decisions swayed largely by appearances (individual charm, as Lewis puts it), subjective impressions, and, as the books stresses repeatedly, the urge to preserve the image of the individual making the decision among his (apparently, \\"her\\" has no role here) peers. The combination of these factors characterizes the irrational decisions that Billy Beane and his assistants challenged. Lewis traces back this line of thought back to 1977 when a guy named Bill James self-published his first Baseball Abstract, effectively giving birth to the discipline of sabermatics, the analysis of baseball through objective statistics. From there, Lewis traces a brief history of how this line of thought developed into a full-fledged science and an industry, and how the Oakland A's made use of these ideas to become one of the most successful teams in the history of baseball, on a fraction of the budget of some of their competitors.<br /><br />If you're a fan of baseball, this is definitely a book you will find thrilling and enjoyable. If you're not, you will still find it interesting, if you read it with an open mind. It's a well written book overall, and it succeeds in bringing the thrill of the game to the reader.terizes the irrational decisions that Billy Beane and his assistants challenged.

B001H5X7I4|3.0|The first half-hour of this movie - the set-up - is brilliant and enormously funny. But they just didn't seem to know where to go with it as the plot progressed, and the laughs became fewer and farther-between. I would have been happy with a shorter movie that cut 20 minutes out of the  tedious ending.    I'm not much of a Ben Stiller fan, but he did a good job with the concept for this movie.  I just wish it had been as good throughout as it was in the first part

B001R10BM8|5.0|Just received the disc and finished watching it. I suspect the negative reviews are fans who just want to see the \\"Eon\\" formula film exotic locate,girls lots of explosions etc. The \\"Never\\" producers and Connery himself did not want to make an Eon type film. I especially enjoy the subtle self depreciating humor throughout the film. A little bit of trivia the underwater scenes of Never Say Never and Thunderball were photographed by the same man Ricou Browning. Come on Bond fans enjoy the film!
B000K7VHSM|5.0|I watched this movie several times and enjoyed it every time.  It's sad that society can't allow people to be themselves and are so judgemental about other's choices in life styles. Being beaten to death because of a different life style is unacceptable.

B000000W5N|5.0|This is one of the classic Stones releases, the first one with Mick Taylor.  Every song drips with drug and sex references, from the opening chords of \\"Brown Sugar\\" to the closer \\"Moonlight Mile\\".  In between, session players like Billy Preston add to the newly rejuvenated sound with Taylor.  \\"Sway\\" is a good song, but I do not feel is one of the better tunes on this disk. The Richards classic, \\"Wild Horses\\" is a stellar tale of pain and drug addicted love.  \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is a true rocker, with an extended jam at the end that is a marvelous mix of guitars, bass, keys, drums and sax. \\"You Gotta Move\\" is a take on an old blues number, with chemical inspiration.  What was the second side opens with \\"Bitch\\" a classic Jagger work with great yacking horns throughtout and masterfully tight drumming by Charlie Watts. \\"I Got the Blues\\" is self explanitory, as is \\"Sister Morphine\\" a drug tale with an ironic twist that Marianne Faithfull claims to have had stolen by Richards.  \\"Dead Flowers\\" is a comic take on wedding bell blues, with a country feel that parodies the FTD Florist tag line of the day.  In all, this is one of the best Stones releases of the Mick Taylor period.

0140274111|5.0|This is a short novella, and a page turner set in New York city in the 1950s or late 1940s.<br /><br />Truman Capote, 1924 to 1984, is a well know American writer. I have read a number of his works including his famous In Cold Blood, a book that I recommend highly. Also, I read some of his early work including Other Voices, Other Rooms, and many of his short stories. Generally, he is regarded as an excellent writer or a highly gifted writer. He ranks among the best of his time. In Cold Blood is probably his finest work and one of the better crime books of the twentieth century.<br /><br />There are some parallels between Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby and Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's. Both show an attempt by the writers to write a novel different from their prior works using clear and straightforward prose, and with relatively coherent plots. One could say these works were more commercially oriented. Perhaps they had the idea of novels as the basis of screenplays or a play. The work is less complex than most of Capote's prior works and it seems more polished. Capote called it the beginning of his second career where he thinned out the prose. It is the opposite of his obscure and creative Other Voices, Other Rooms. F. Scott Fitzgerald made similar comments in his diaries on the preparation of Gatsby.<br /><br />This is a short novel or novella. It involves the fictitious friend of the writer, Holly Golightly, and their mutual friend Joe Bell, a bar owner in Manhattan. She is a free spirit and a neighbour of the narrator living below him in an apartment. They share the telephone at Joe's bar, and Joe takes messages for them. We follow some of her escapades and the relationship between the narrator and Holly. We assume that the narrator is like Capote.<br /><br />In my own mind, it seems difficult to equate the woman in the story with Audrey Hepburn who appears in the movie version. The woman in the book seems younger, more sexual, and more manipulative.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining book which is hard to put down.  It is among the best works of Capote<br /><br />Fine writing: 5 stars.is a very entertaining book which is hard to put down.  It is among the best works of Capote<br /><br />Fine writing: 5 stars.
B001UOVP1S|2.0|The Cornell/Timbaland combo will probably be too much for the die hard Cornell solo album/Audioslave/Soundgarden fans, but hip-hop/r&b may give it a whirl.<br /><br />I actually thought that I had downloaded the wrong album from Amazon. Cornell's voice sounds as soulful and powerful as ever and Timbaland does a great job of mixing things up.  But mixing gravel and slick beats wasn't what I had in mind.  The production and sound are so far from anything else Cornell has done, 90's rock meets Young MC's beatbox.  Cornell thinks his fans will come around to this sound, but I think that is very unlikely.  Chances are he will start up a new fan base if he can sell his soul to kings of radio.<br /><br />I admit that on my second listen to Scream, I discovered that a few of the songs were worth hearing again, hence a two star rating. However, I can never envision putting this on under any circumstances for a full listen.  It's like listening to nails on a chalkboard after expecting to get Blackhole Sun, Spoonman, or anything off of Euphoria Morning.  Die hard fans may be slitting their wrists two minutes into the first track.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|One of the best 'thinking' games. Our 13 year olds like it better than Monopoly and Big Business. Quicker than Risk, takes more strategy. Well worth the cost. Really helpful to have someone who has played it to instruct for the first time. Instructions could be a little clearer.
B00021HBGS|5.0|This is an excellent product. One of my concerns was the adhesion, and to my surprise they stick to the sides and walls of the tub perfectly. My sons love this toy and the only drawback was trying to get them out of the tub. Great buy, great product, lots of fun.
0930289234|5.0|This was my first time reading the Watchmen graphic novel and I must say it is a classic. I liked the movie alot so I was curious to read the story. The movie sticks very close to the book even using most of the same dialouge. The only difference in the book is Spectre 2's outfit which I think is actually better in the movie. Everyone's favorite character seems to be Rorshack which is understandable since he has the best lines. The artwork is exceptional and the story is one of the most original and different for a comic/graphic novel. It is geared more for adults since this isn't the usual kiddie comic book. That is what makes it so popular no doubt. I think most comics today are more for adult taste anyway. If you've never read Watchmen before then I highly reccomend it. It is a page turner which I always liked the best. A story that grabs you and doesn't let go until the last page. After reading this I think I will look into other graphic novels as well to see if they are any match.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|In a 1964 Catholic school, a priest has been accused--by the school's principle--of molesting the only black student.  This is the main plot of DOUBT, though as with any film of this nature, there's much more to it: tolerance, sexism, and yes, doubt in many of its forms.  This creates a slow-moving film that may not be for all viewers; it is a film made to make you think--especially the final confrontation between Streep and Hoffman, and viewers with little patience will come away somewhat disappointed.  That cannot be helped.<br /><br />There is a reason why four of DOUBT's principle actors were nominated for awards: This film is driven by its actors, namely Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis.  Hoffman is in strong form as always; Davis, in her too-brief role, is a marvel; Adams proves yet again she is a very reliable actress.  It is, however, Streep who steals the show, diving headlong into the character of a traditional nun who resents the presence of a reform-minded priest.  The actors help the film avoid the many pitfalls--too many dramatic camera angles, a couple of minor subplots that are distracting.  The theme is strong and well-carried out (this film was also nominated for its script, and rightly so), but it is up to the actors to make everything work.  And they do.  If nothing else, DOUBT is proof that there are genuinely talented actors still working in Hollywood, and filmmakers willing to challenge their viewers, even if it means low Box Office receipts and certain audience members getting offended (lets face it, it always happens).
0525421033|5.0|All I can say is WOW.  I finished this book at 2 AM this morning and I'm still thinking about how much it moved me.  I cried several times and just fell in love with Mia and all those who surrounded her, \\"her family\\". It's a truly touching and a wonderful story, when I finished I was left wanting to know more about her families past adventures. And how Forman describes the families love of music drives you to want to pick up an instrument and learn to play. I enjoy all types of music and can't wait to check out Yo-Yo-Ma, aka \\"Yo Mama\\" per Adam.  This is a great read and you will not be disappointed.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|A MOVIE THAT SHOWS HOW EVIL THE MIND CAN BECOME.  I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|This tv show is amazing. Not only is it highly entertaining with all the action but it also has a very deep storyline that captures the viewer each episode. I can not wait for the next season.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|The delivery of the item was longer that anticipated.  I have ordered items in the past via standard shipping, and have generally received them in a timely fashion.  That was not the case with this purchase.  The description read \\"NEW.\\"  However, upon receiving the item, the box was damaged in a corner, all of the disks have imperfections, which leads me to beleive the DVD's were in fact not \\"NEW\\" as listed in the description, and were probably \\"USED.\\"  Also, the DVD's skip when played.  I order from Amazon quite regularly and this is the only time that I have been completely dissatisfied.  I couldn't return the product because there was an all sales final policy in place.  What really upsets me is that the purchase was a birthday gift, some gift.  I highly recommend purchasing from another seller.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I've had the SB-900 for a few months now, and it's a real workhorse. I'm not a professional, just a serious amateur. I do not shoot events, strictly portraiture, and I have had no problems as of yet. The thermal shutdown has not been an issue for me. I did a little test to see what it can take. I put in fresh batteries, set it to full power on Manual mode, and just repeatedly pressed the flash button as soon as it recycled, which was about 2-2.5 seconds. The gauge did not move. Where I did get some high temperature was in constant shooting in Repeating mode at high power. Quite honestly, I think that this is a great feature. I'd rather be out of comission for a few minutes than incinerate a $450 Speedlight.     Speaking of features, it's a great upgrade from the SB-800. I love the extended zoom to 200mm, which allows me to really concentrate the light. I love the supplied diffusion dome and filter holder, though the little chips on the gels only communicate with the camera as long as it's hot shoed and in Auto WB. (I prefer to set the WB myself.)     All in all, it's a big, sturdy workhorse of a flash, and there's a plethora of accessories available that will work (Honl, Lumiquest, Lasolite). As soon as I get some extra coin, there'll be at least two more in my bag.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|I ordered this for my 14-year old daughter's birthday and have no idea what it is or what it's about.  She enjoyed it very much, though, which is all that I care about.

B001QB9H1K|2.0|I generally expect sequels to be weaker than the initial film, and am usually unsurprised. Transporter 3, however, was even weaker than it should have been. Why oh why to moviemakers forget about the script when they make these things? Good car chases and special effects -- but who cares? By the end of the movie you're hoping they all die, from sheer boredom. Great action movies make us CARE about the characters -- sometimes even the bad guys. Bad action movies just have action -- like this one.
B000RZGIQ8|3.0|The title has been reviewed zillions of times for more than 23 years so I am reviewing this title for it's release on Blu-ray DVD.  Watching the Blu-ray disc reminded me of the first time I saw the film on the big screen back in '86.  The colors were vivid, the details were sharp, and the picture bright on a Samsung 1080p 52\\" LCD.  The sharpness is also a curse.  Film grain is very apparent in the low light sequences, especially in the opening scene on the carrier flight deck.  The \\"chopped\\" widescreen format does look odd at times. There is some definite cropping that detracts from what could have been a magnificent cinematic experience.     I found the audio in this release to be lackluster.  The standard edition DVD and even a VHS copy lets loose with crushing bass that can be felt as much as heard through an older 5.1 w/subwoofer system.  This Blu-ray audio weezes out the bass with the same sound system settings.  If you're stuck with dolby 5.1, go for the standard DVD for acceptable sound.    One very annoying artifact is that the closed captioning is default \\"on.\\"  This is the only disc I have ever purchased or rented that required captioning to be turned off when attempting to play right out of the case.    Oddly, Blu-ray didn't seem to do anything for the cheesy sophomoric plot.  But the flying sequences sure looked great!
B00006FDCD|5.0|I WAS VERY PLEASED WHEN I RECIEVED THE PRODUCT. IT WAS IN THE CONDITION DESCRIBED ON THE WEBSITE AND IT WAS SHIPPED IN VERY QUICK AFTER I PURCHASED IT.

0679809015|5.0|A Chunky Flap Book.  I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter who loves farm animals.  At first, the size seemed too small, but for little hands it is good.  I am quite pleased with the book.  These two grandkids (ages 1 and 2) are crazy about books, therefore, we depend on reviews when we shop.
B001F12J48|5.0|Firstly I used a Epson Dreamio to watch this DVD. So it was about a 10foot screen, and I must say, for home 3D especially with anaglyphic technology, amazing, hands down the BEST 3D movie that I own for this format. I do own a few shutter DVDs as well, far better technology, but does not work on an LCD projector. So I started to collect anaglyph prints.    I did skim through this on my PC, and on a 15'' screen this does look like crap. But in my home cinema, amazing, everyone who sat through the screening was totally blown away.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Kudos to Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman,   Viola Davis & Amy Adams!!  WOW!!--This film is powerful and definitely oscar-worthy   in a year of many oscar-worthy performances.   The writing an direction are amazing as well..very well put together.   Set in a catholic church-school in 1964, a young black kid from   a low income/low self-esteem background is sent there by   his struggling mother (Viola Davis) who wants her son to   have better opportunites and a chance to dodge the evils   of his environment, but has she unknowingly  made her child jump out of the skillet and into the fire?   A fire that most people at that time found to be unimaginable!!  But we who watch with 2009 eyes know all too well that strange   things have gone on in these places that were once considered   to be beyond reproach and sacred enough that we would commit   our most precious assets (our children) to without even   a second thought!  Meryl Streep plays the stern, dogmatic and no-nonsense   Sister Superior role to the max in this, and once she senses   that something isn't right with the relationship between   the Preist (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and the young black kid,   she is like a pitbull in her determination to get   to the bottom of things!   Amy Adams plays her role with a wide-eyed trusting   innocence until that innocence is shattered by a chance   discovery that awakens many doubts!   I don't like to give spoilers in my reviews because   I like to leave room for the ones who haven't   seen a particular film to judge for themselves.   But make no mistakes!--This is a brilliant and stirring   piece of work, a must-see and very deserving   of it's 5 Oscar Noms!   Check it out if you already haven't!!

After about 5 days of trying to download an update and get it transferred to the DVD player - I finally got it to work. The movie plays fine now. It cost me an extra $12 for a different USB data storage device and a few more grey hairs.  But it is now playable.
0345495004|5.0|This book started out a bit on the dry side. Halfway through, I was hooked. By the end of the book, I was crying. Nancy Horan weaves quite a tale that will hook you when you least expect it. The affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Cheney was doomed almost from the beginning. After years of personal and professional struggle for both of them, they finally start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, that is never to be. Be advised, this is a book with a depressing ending, but I am so glad I read it.
B000002UAU|5.0|Apple records announced today, that the remastered editions of the entire BEATLES catalouge will be released on SEPTEMBER 9th, 2009. (NUMBER 9, NUMBER 9, NUMBER 9, of course!) So, for those of you who have NEVER bought any of the Beatles CDs, PLEASE WAIT!  The Beatle's music was very late, as far as ALBUM CLASSICS go, for their original CD mastering.  Nothing was released until around 1987, which means the digital quality is  what was current, over 20 years ago. If you compair the digital bit rates, to PIXEL DEPTH of a photograph or TV, then you are compairing a picture of the MONA LISA made from 8 pixels per square inch, with a photo of the Mona Lisa made from 100,000 pixels per square inch. Now, we have that HIGH DEFINITION, 24 bit remastering. All the warmth of Analouge is preserved, with the clarity of digital.  FINALLY the Beatles will release their ENTIRE CATALOUGE remastered. PLUS, each album will have a quick time movie, that shows HOW the album was made, little audio outtakes, etc. PLUS, past masters 1 and 2 are going to be united to ONE CD, and....THE MONO EDITIONS WILL BE RELEASED AS WELL!!!! (Finally, the MONO SGT PEPPER ALBUM, MONO WHITE ALBUM, MONO REVOLVER ALL ON CD!!!!!) OKAY, so now that we know to WAIT until September to buy the SGT PEPPER ALBUM, i just want to put my two cents into the reason why THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER RECORDED.<br /><br />  Most people have heard so much about the Beatles, and this album, that they have formed an opinion about it, often without ever having heard the album.  This was true back in 1980 with some of my friends, and it's still true today.  Now that this album is 42 years old, you would think it would be at least SOMEWHAT dated. Much from the 60s DOES SOUND dated, but the Beatle's work does not. It truly DOES tap into the eternal beauty of the human soul.  Sgt. Pepper is often credited as the first \\"artrock\\" album, and first \\"Concept album\\" as well.  John Lennon used to INSIST that this was a  concept album, without a concept. But the concept is almost TOO SIMPLE to see.  It contains a very obvious concept: THE BANALITY OF MODERN DAY LIFE.  The whole idea of \\"Psychedelic music\\", was to return \\"technicolor\\" back to a drab and dreary world, to make the monotony of WORK, HOME, EAT, SLEEP, WAKE UP, WORK, HOME, EAT, SLEEP, or the monotonous rites of passage like, MARRIAGE (when i'm 64), Leaving home (SHE's LEAVING HOME), going to church (WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU), and death (A DAY IN THE LIFE, which talks about the death in a car crash, in warfare, etc.) Either way you look at it, life can be a DRAG, a dull, boring, tedious DRAG. The beatles were really fighting against......A DULL AND BORING LIFE. Each song deals with an aspect of daily life, that artists had tried to elevate the human awareness beyond, especially since the romantic movement, and the rediscovery of mind expanding drugs into our culture.  SGT PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB, is a song about the isolation of the human experience....we are ALL loney, ALL unable to really connect with the OTHER. BUT, the idea of Psychedelic drugs, was that you could mind merge with your fellow trippers, and become a BAND with each other, and ONE with the universe. SURE, it does sound a bit trite now, a bit pseudo utopian in these days of terrorism, crackheads and meth heads, and DEATH CENTERED video games, which have replaced the hippie idealism. BUT, are we better off SPIRITUALLY today? For that matter, SOCIALLY? Or MATERIALLY? Well, not really.  IN fact, we are closer to this existencial isolation of the human TODAY, than we were 40 years ago.  The Beatles created an album of closely related songs, that examined the Generation Gap, which is really the GAP between the HIP, and the HYPED. How many people today, live a life where they are CONSTANTLY HYPED, into buying a new computer game, iPod, iPhone, etc?  These hypes, are just as empty, and lifeless, as the materialistic hypes from that era.<br /><br />This album CHALLENGES YOU to elevate your awareness....not nessacarily with drugs, but with a bigger picture of HOW IT ALL GOES TOGETHER.  Anyone of us, can elevate ourselves like the Beatles did, when they put on the costumes of a typical \\"psychedelic San Fransesco hippie Band\\", grew out their hair, and studied eastern spirituality, as a way to see that the world is SO MUCH MORE than daily awareness lets us know about. This \\"awareness\\" was long the priviledge of the artists, but by 1967 EVERYBODY could join the party. Once you joined the \\"SGT PEPPER LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND\\", and reinvented yourself, you could GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP OF YOUR FRIENDS. (Join a commune, or a meditation group.) ANd, you could see new visions, like LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS. (A childLIKE vision, based on Jesus' saying that no one enters Heaven, unless they become LIKE CHILDREN.)  That is the REAL idea here. Lennon based the song on a child's world, his 7 year old son's drawing of a woman in the stars. Then, once you did this, life would start GETTING BETTER.  If something was raining on your world, making life a drag, instead of complaining, you just go up on the roof, and start FIXING A HOLE. Then, you remove yourself from the world of dull, backward looking people. SHE\\"S LEAVING HOME was the parents perspective, of a daughter doing just that....leaving behind parents that controlled her thru guilt (We gave her most of our lives....SURE mom and dad, SURE you did.) THEN, the woman joins the band, and marches right into what Herman Hesse called \\"The Circus of the Mind\\". And tonight the Circus is FOR THE BENEFIT OF MISTER KITE, as we fly HIGHER and HIGHER into a phasmagorical dreamland, shooting stars twirling into colorful sparks, that you may NEVER want to leave. What does the \\"experience\\" Teach? George Harrison thought that life always keeps going on, WITHIN YOU AND WITHOUT YOU. (The squares laugh at the end of this song, all about eastern spirituality, complete with sitars, tablas, and the first real visions of GLOBALIZATION applied to a new sound: World music.)  If the album ONLY had George's magnum opus on it, it would STILL be one of the greatest rock songs ever. After you get your head together, with a little help of the CIRCUS of the MIND, and some Transcendental Meditation/eastern Mystisicm, you still had to wonder about what life would be like, in 40 years. Would the lover you have in your youth, love you for MORE than your beauty? Will I be loved WHEN I\\"M SIXTY FOUR? Sure, even those people who tried to BE HERE NOW, thought of the future.  Even if you were hip, you STILL had to work, just like LOVELY RITA the Meter maid. (Another strike at the military industrial complex, cos RITA looked a little like a MILITARY MAN.) SURE, you may become aware of the TRUTH,  but you STILL have to get up  tomorrow, and face another day, pour your cornflakes and milk, and say GOODMORNING GOODMORNING to the blahs of the working week. BUT WAIT!! THe circle is always coming around again, as the time comes to meet up with your friends who help you get high, and see the VISIONS again, and again, and again....each day become another DAY IN THE LIFE, until all the days are past, and we DIE. BUT, before we die without knowing that another way of seeing the world exists out there, the Beatles want to do something for you, they would LOVE TO TURN YOU ON!  Oh yes, yes they would, and they STILL  want to do that.  Fourty years later, and i cant think of a SINGLE album that sums up the world, and life, and death, and all the circles within circles we pass thru,  all the stages of life, all the joys, and sorrows, all the boredoms and ecstacies, the way SGT PEPPER does. Is it the BEST music, that the Beatle's recorded? Well, song by song, maybe not. I still like the WHITE ALBUM a bit better, just cos the songs were a bit more centered.  But if ART REFLECTS LIFE, and if LIFE is about the BEAUTIFUL and the DULL, the YIN AND YANG, being BORN again (as a new BAND, or persona), and DYING (to the self, or to the world), then this \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" world recreats what other poets couldnt achieve thru PAGES and PAGES of obtuse poems meant for the educated, privledged few. NOW, this is a TRUE ART, produced for ALL PEOPLE...and like all TRUE ART, it isnt about the PAST. It's about NOW. BECAUSE THE HUMAN CONDISTION IS ALWAYS THE SAME. WE might decorate our lives a bit differently. Maybe telephones are smaller, or you can watch a million different movies on your BIG SCREEN TV, but its the SAME LIFE, the same people living it.  ONE THING IS FOR SURE....if you think that this was your PARENTS/GRANDPARENTS music, or whatever, then you might as well never listen to MOZART, cos it was your GREAT GREAT GREATx3 GRANDPARENTS MUSIC, or not listen to the sitar, because its music for somebody else's ancestors. If we have REALLY come to the point, where we cant find TRUTH, BEAUTY and ENLIGHTENMENT unless it comes packaged as a BRAND NEW VIDEO GAME, which needs a $300 new control unit, and a $75 program, and a $800 HI DEF TV screen, then I really feel sorry for the world today, and the kids coming up. BECAUSE, for the price of a MOVIE, this album gives you MORE ENTERTAINMENT, than a hundred video games, which grow old, as soon as the next version comes out in a couple of years, or a new RAP star, who also becomes old, as soon as the newer face comes on the scene. SGT PEPPER has a message. Yes, we are ALL UNITED, by our COMMUNAL LIFE DRAMAS, DISAPPOINTMENTS, DREAMS, and VISIONS.  It is the voice of the ETERNAL SHAMAN, and if we no longer listen to THAT voice, then life IS A DRAG.<br /><br />If you are just TOO COOL, and TOO KNOWLEDGABLE to get into this CD, cos you know ALL ABOUT WHAT IT IS, even if you never heard it, then you are very closed minded. OPEN YOUR MIND. As for the music on this album, it is every bit as fresh now, as when it was made. MUSIC PRODUCERS to this day have no idea how all this sound got onto a 4 track tape.  It should sound as lo-fi as Half Japanese. Instead, there is so much happening, that you could listen to it all your life, and NEVER hear everything. BECAUSE GREAT ART CHANGES WITH YOU, and renews itself WITH YOU, because its part of the ETERNAL CHANGING NOW.  And, if you need ANY MORE PERSUASION, just wait until SEPT 9th, 2009, and hear the NEW REMASTERING. AMAZON.com arent placing pre-orders yet, but as soon as they do, I'm there.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|The Planet Earth series is a must for everyone. The blue ray version is more jaw dropping than anyone can imagine.  So many rare things that were never filmed before come alive. From the driest deserts to the highest mountains and the oceans as well, Planet Earth shows off plant and animal life like never before. How certain areas are transformed from winter to summer is truly amazing.
B001NXBRJG|4.0|If you've seen The Matrix you know why the film community heralds it as a benchmark achievement in filmmaking. Just as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Wars set the bar for film special effects, The Matrix came along and made us re-examine everything we thought a movie could do. Revolutionary, groundbreaking, mindblowing - these are all terms people use to describe The Matrix. It's certainly all true, but up until now, what I'd appreciated most about The Matrix was this: it packaged a Philosophy 101 course into a digestible Sci-Fi flick with a raging techno/rock/orchestral score and jaw-dropping action sequences. The Blu-ray release of The Matrix turns this scale on its head bringing the action scenes to the level they were always meant to reach - now the film is superb all the way around.<br /><br />Andy and Larry Wachowski invited us to follow the white rabbit down the hole into an exploration of perception versus reality. If the entire world we live in - the air, the terrain and the other people - is nothing but a computer program, what is our reality? Do we consider the magenta-hued egg which sustains us while sapping our bioelectricity to be our reality? Or is the manufactured existence within a computer the truest one? Neo chooses the red pill and plunges into the terrifying truth of what reality has become. Amidst a group of ragtag survivors in c. 2199, Neo (Keanu Reeves) discovers the truth behind the Matrix under the guidance of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).<br /><br />Despite The Matrix being stuffed with heaping spoonfuls of rudimentary philosophical musings, the plot is remarkably simple in structure. The entire second and third acts stem from Neo's attempting to verify his place in his new reality. He does so by diving back into the fictional world of the Matrix to confront the Oracle and in the process Morpheus is taken captive and the remaining members of the team mount a plan to rescue him. That's The Matrix at its most barebones level. What that description fails to impart are all the aspects that make The Matrix so memorable. Attached to that frame is a traitorous monad who longs to once again lose himself in the Matrix (Joe Pantoliano), a tireless Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) seeking to end Neo and the omnipresent question of whether a true reality or an altered perception thereof is preferable. The latter might make you comfortable, but are you really living?<br /><br />But I already own The Matrix on DVD, should I double dip? Is it worth the second purchase?  There are two types of movies where high-definition makes a difference. The first is animation: the colors are crisper, the edges smoother and everything has vibrancy unparalleled in the DVD format. The second is balls to the wall action films with special effects that break all the rules: like The Matrix. Watching a helicopter spiral out of control and plummet into the side of a skyscraper which then ripples like a puddle is cool. Watching it in high-definition - it's like seeing the face of a special effects god for the first time. Yes, it's worth the second purchase. Buy it on Blu-ray, give your DVD copy to a friend...and just laugh at what they're missing. It's movies like The Matrix in high-definition that should be automatic purchases for the more discerning consumer.<br /><br />Blu-ray Bonus Features<br /><br />Normally, I just plow through the trailers and audio commentary section, but in the case of The Matrix on Blu-ray special consideration is deserved. Your first audio commentary choice is a virtual Philosophy 101 lecture about the ideas presented in The Matrix taught by Dr. Cornel West and Ken Wilber - it's really interesting for newcomers but not quite meaty enough for anyone more versed in deep thinking. The second commentary comes from film critics Todd McCarthy, John Powers and David Thomson - this is somewhat obnoxious. It's an audio track of them praising The Matrix with a few snippets of legitimate criticism thrown in as if to validate their presence in commentary form. Thirdly, a cast and crew commentary features Carrie-Anne Moss, Zach Staenberg (editor) and John Gaeta (visual effects supervisor) discussing all the usual facets: working with the big names in the cast, the stunt work, the direction, etc. Finally, not so much a commentary but audio track, there's the option to play the film with no sound (diagetic or non) besides the score. It's a surreal experience and one of my favorite ways to watch the action sequences.<br /><br />Finally, there's another commentary of sorts which is the &#34;In-Movie Experience&#34; which is really the icing on the commentary cake. Featuring a picture-in-picture box in the lower corners, virtually everyone involved in the film gets their moment in the sun talking about every conceivable part of the film from auditions, to stunt work, to personal relationships and what they took away from the film. Brilliantly laid in, it's worth your time.<br /><br />As was offered previously, &#34;The Matrix Revisited&#34;, a feature-length documentary on the making of the original film, comes with the main feature. Definitely interesting for fans and film geeks who want to understand every technological wonder that made this landmark film possible; but for non-Matrix enthusiasts you'll probably find yourself distracted after 20 to 30 minutes. It's interesting as all get out, but you do need to have the initial level of interest to commit to the two hour duration.<br /><br />We have a healthy smattering of production diary featurettes chronicling things like the injuries suffered by Hugo Weaving while filming and Keanu's obsession over physical motion in specific scenes. Fun to watch and these are essentially the more palatable versions of &#34;The Matrix Revisited&#34; for the less devoted among us.<br /><br />The last batch of features is a virtual jukebox of the music from The Matrix and includes a music video of Marilyn Manson's &#34;Rock is Dead&#34;. The Music Revisited is a terrific addition and helps track down some of the great tracks from the film that you might not have known the names of.<br /><br />To top it all off, the packaging itself is in a book format with an attached full-color booklet with articles on the production, profiles, etc. Neat-o.cism thrown in as if to validate their presence in commentary form.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|This movie is brilliantly written and the actors are totally outstanding.  The four work so well with each other.  I keep asking myself, \\"Is that really Meryl Streep?\\"  I do believe this is her best work.  Even though this movie takes place at a Catholic School it addresses a universal problem.  Every parent should see this movie.  There's a big lesson here about suspicion and jumping to conclusions.  It will mesmerize you throughout.  It will keep you guessing and I guarantee that you'll be glad you took the ride.  This movie will make you \\"GASP.\\"
B000B5XOYI|4.0|When I heard this item was being re-released by Warner Brothers, three years after it went out of print, I jumped at the chance to get it.    While I haven't viewed both Batman discs, I have viewed all the others.  While some of the special features can be repetitive (such as the Heroes & Villains galleries), the featurettes that detail how the films were made are adequate enough to keep your interest, especially the Batman & Robin Special Features disc.  Everyone giving an interview (except for Chris O'Donnell) tries to justify the film's existence and creation (ie:  the production designer).    If you're a fan, this is definitely worth owning.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Well, it's BBC and we've seen what they can do with Blue Planet.  Planet Earth is simply amazing... stunning images and talk about being in the right place at the right time (or waiting for the right time)!  To imagine all of what they caught on film is merely a glimpse of the amazing phenomenon that is life on our planet!  What will they come up with next...?  And as a side note, I prefer David Attenborough's naration to Sigourney Weaver's; his voice adds to the excitement of what you're seeing.
1409953203|4.0|Quels sont les secrets, prudemment gardés, des personnes avec lesquelles nous partagions une vie? Quels sont les limites, et meme les profondeurs, de notre ignorance et naiveté si bien nourries? Quand le dernier crépuscule tombe et dédaigne de s'attarder, qu'est-ce qu'il nous restera pour nous mener a bon fin? Sur quoi pourrons nous prodiguer les derniers de nos jours? Voila quelques unes des questions caverneuses qui s'ouvrent béantes avant ceux qui lisent ce roman. L'héroine est agréable a l'exces, mais alors meme qu'on l'aime--et en fait on l'aime jusqu'a la fin--on commence a se demander si elle vraiment a toute sa tete. Est-elle en effet incapable d'éviter quelques unes des horreurs qui l'assaillent? Est-elle l'innocente victime de ceux qui décident son sort at qui l'ont créé  comme elle est? Chose étrange, mais c'est possible que le personnage le plus attachant  de ce roman c'est la demeure ancestrale, ou la plupart de l'action a lieu. Plantée sur une falaise aupres d'Yport, au Pays de Caux en Haute Normandie, elle regarde la mer qu'il pleuve ou qu'il vente, aimée par ses habitants, mais beaucoup desservie en fin de compte. Pourtant elle connaît la ténacité  et la mesure et sa place. Si seulement ceux qui s'abritent derriere ses murs pourraient apprendres de ses lignes, de son bon sens silencieux, de son ordre, de son repos.
B001CUXZT0|2.0|I bought this album on vinyl when it first came out.  I was absolutley blown away when the needle touched down to reveal the first song \\"It's Hot Tonight\\".  This is arguably Alice's finest solo song.  The guitars are there & the sneering Alice vocals are back.  But that is where it ends, my comrads.  The title track \\"Lace & Whiskey\\" sounded like it should have been from a caberet show.  And sure enough when this album was released, Alice did the title track on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show.  Anyone remember the giant dancing chickens with machine guns on stage???  Mercy, Alice...set down the booze.  Next up is \\"Road Rats\\"...a decent song with some heavier guitars about the life of roadies.  \\"Damned if You Do\\" is just shameful.  \\"You & Me\\" is a fine ballad.  \\"Ubangi Stomp\\" is fun but not what I'd want to hear from Alice. The rest of this album just gets worse with each track.  \\"No More Love at Your Convenience\\"...embarrassing.  \\"I Never Wrote Those Songs\\"...unfortunately on the liner notes it says you DID write those songs.<br />What makes this album even worse was the production and mastering.  Just a horrible, horrible sound.<br />The only real saving grace is \\"It's Hot Tonight\\".  Find a deal on a used copy to make it worth your while.

B001PTG4C8|4.0|I purchased this book a couple of years ago but never got around to reading it for one reason or another. Once I started, however, I could not put the book down until the end. It is very readable.<br /><br />I was, however, rather annoyed by the author's tendency to weave thinly disguised episodes into the story (such as the Venlo incident in Holland and the Krivitsky \\"suicide\\" in Washington, not to mention recognizable descriptions of SIS officers). Since these episodes were never really developed, they seemed to be little more than superficial plot points thrust into the story to lend it a tone of verisimilitude. Other reviewers have commented on  extraneous and undeveloped characters in the life of Ruth, the principal narrator; and while I rather enjoyed the relationship between Ruth and her son, Jochen, I can't imagine a real mother allowing such dubious characters as Ludger and Ilse anywhere near her child, much less having them live in the same house. And would a real mother actually take her young son to a potentially dangerous student demonstration and then urge him to throw a raw egg with police in attendance?<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book has much to recommend it. The central character, Eve, Ruth's mother, is engaging. I especially enjoyed the episodes that centered upon Eva's training for her future clandestine profession. And while I was not always convinced by her narrative voice (The third person in a supposed revelation to her daughter Ruth was somewhat disruptive in an otherwise first-person narrative.), I found her story absorbing, especially the episodes in New York centering on British efforts to get the United States to participate in the war against Germany.<br /><br />Unfortunately, just at the point when the author could have really explored this fascinating aspect of the story in depth, he sent the heroine off literally on detour after detour--too many bolt-holes; too many identities; and too many loose ends, which the pat answers at the end of the book simply did not tie together.id not tie together.
1439138311|4.0|Colm Toibin is an adept writer who elegantly captures the feeling of despair, longing, loneliness, passivity, and acceptance.  All of these seem to follow Eilis, the main character in 'Brooklyn.'  There are several characters and interactions that are vividly portrayed here, as well.  However, in total, one does not walk away from the book with a keen sense of place.  This is a character-driven book. There is, essentially, little plot and little action.  I would not call this a classic immigrant story.   Eilis's voyage to America, life in a boarding house in Brooklyn, as well as a job on Fulton Street all seem precipitously planned for her by a Father Flood.  She seems to be deeply rooted in her Irish Village and is very connected to her mother and sister Rose.  However, Eilis possibly does not communicate the depth of this 'connectedness' since she shares [with the reader] her questions as to why it is she who is being uprooted rather than her sister Rose.  Rose is her vibrant older sister who has an office job, plays golf and dresses with a certain flare.  It is Rose who seems to embrace life more than Eilis.  However, it may well be for this very reason that Eilis was chosen to experience something new and different.  We travel, third class, with Eilis from Ireland to America, and it is an arduous crossing.  We feel her homesickness, her utter despair at being alone in a foreign land.  However, with the help of Father Flood, Eilis soon is even more occupied with night classes at Brooklyn College. [I loved the exchange between Ellis and the Business Law instructor.  She seems so earnest, and he appears utterly taken by her interest in the topic he is trying to teach.]  Unfortunately, there are too few of these types of verbal exchanges within 'Brooklyn.'  Readers who think that they will learn more about Brooklyn and/or reconnect with that borough will be greatly disappointed.  Readers who are interested in experiencing the blooming of a fairly unanimated character's emergence might enjoy this book.  When Eilis returns home due to a family tragedy, she emerges as someone with [dare I say] some panache -- especially in her attire.  She seems, somewhat, freer with her emotions, as well.  Eilis does remind me of the type of person why might be counted upon [relied upon] during troubling and/or hectic times.  These are admirable people.   While they are not always interesting, they are often, in the final analysis, important individuals.  There are some unanswered questions here, and it is my opinion that this was meant to be.  Who engineered this migration for Eilis?  Who is her benefactor?  This book does not totally engage, on a consistent basis,  but when it does, it is quite good.  If you are a patient reader, 'Brooklyn' might suit you.  If not, it might disappoint.
159562015X|5.0|I was shocked that the online test component of this book's strengths assessment could figure me out so accurately. The insights are very helpful as I seek to improve my personal performance & effectiveness. It renders clear directives for career enhancement. And with the book's low cost, it is vastly more economical than other similar personality profiling tests.
B001TH16DI|1.0|Like many who have expressed interest then disappointment in this set of Star Trek movies I will be holding off from forking over the beans until a worthwhile edition of these movies is released on Blu Ray.    I'd also like to express my gratitude to those of you who take the time to inform the rest of us when a company is just being plain lazy and greedy in releasing a substandard product.    Consumers unite! :)       (note to the producers,take a leaf out of Disney's marketing strategy in giving customers a sense of value for the money we spend on their Blu Rays).

B001FB4W0W|5.0|This was one of the Best series I have watched. At first I didn't think it would be any good and after I watched the first episode I was completely addicted to it. I would recommend these series to anyone and the books a great too.

B0014I4KH6|5.0|Okay, so I've had this album since last October, but have just thought to review it now.<br />I actually found this here in New Zealand (unfortunately it was $40NZD--I should have checked out Amazon first!)<br />and I fell in love with this album!<br />If it wasn't for Joe Jonas, I probably wouldn't really know who she is. But this album is amazing for a first, breakout album. Taylor's really gone far and is going far in her music. My favourite tracks off this CD are \\"Picture To Burn\\" and \\"Mary's Song (Oh My My My)\\"<br />If you're a country rocker, or just a Taylor fan, my advice? BUY. THIS. CD. :)

B00192KCQ0|4.0|I must say, before I begin, that I have only just become a Metallica fan. I'm not all that old, and I only bought Death Magnetic because everybody was talking about it. I didn't think I'd like it, but I was surprised by its ferocity and sheer awesomness. It was the best rock I had heard in a very long time. So, after listening to it for a very long time, I bought Metallica's Black Album, then Master of Puppets. I have to say that, compared to those, this album falls short of the greatness I thought it had originally possesed. Still, I would recommend this to new-bee's of Metallica as a good starting point. Just don't stop here.
078401213X|4.0|Now here'a film that is \\"not for all tastes,\\" as the cliché goes.    \\"Strange\\" doesn't quite cover it but it is not that bizarre that you can't figure out what's happening. Director-writer Darren Arokofsky made a name for himself with his second movie, Requiem For A Dream, and this was the young filmmakers' first effort.     It was made a tight budget since he was an unknown, but that's part of the attraction. This is grainy black-and-white, and so is the gritty story and most of the characters. The unique look fits the story.    It's not a story that is going to please a lot of people - an almost-demented math wizard trying to figure out stock market codes and two groups hounding him trying to cash in on his brainpower. One is trying to use him to make big money in the market and the other is trying to decipher ancient Jewish texts and thinks our mathematician can help. Meanwhile, he wants no part of any of these people.    Our hero, the numbers freak, thinks the entire world revolves around numbers. Everything in the universe, he thinks, can be figured out through number codes. Not only is he wacked and paranoid but so is about everyone in here. They all have strange ideas.     Innovative camera-work makes the story even stranger. In fact, it's that photography that makes this DVD a part of my collection    If you're looking for something different here and there, I would give this curiosity piece a quick look, but if you hate it, that wouldn't surprise me, either. It's that kind of love it-or-hate it movie.
B001VWBFTG|4.0|Let's get this straight: this is a solid album. A very solid, very good, album. BUT, it is not a classic, it will probably not be remembered except as a springboard for other, better albums. Because, really, that's what this sounds like: a step towards something better. Some songs are really good, \\"Violet Hill\\" for example, and are sure to be remembered in a greatest hits compilation down the road. But, if you want a good album, something to listen to on the way to work, pick this up. Just don't call it classic.
B00012L786|4.0|The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the Criterion DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.    Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit muchfor an 80-minute mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.    The best part of the disc is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (Say that three times!).     Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as \\"Moe,\\" an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film.    Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by \\"falling in love\\" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. Only in world of film!! Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.    This an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$30. For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Kate Winslet and David Kross star in THE READER, a coming-of-age film set in three time periods about a young teenager named Michael (David Kross) who falls in love and has an affair with an older woman, named Hannah Schmitz (Kate Winslet) in pre-WWII Germany and how that relationship changes the young boy forever.  The overall storyline of THE READER is kind of depressing. There's the whole great lost-love aspect of the film; a love between two people so great that it affects a person so much that he is never able to really love again for the rest of his life.  There's also the shadow of WW2 and the Holocaust that permeates the entire picture.  Lastly, there's also the issue about watching a person being convicted (though being guilty of other horrible crimes) for a crime which she wasn't directly responsible. These are very heavy issues and it doesn't make THE READER an easy film to watch (though I have to admit Kate Winslet helps to make the drama easier to take).  Despite this, the issues the film raises are important and ones everyone should think about now and again.  For instance, if you have evidence that someone did not commit a crime they are being tried for, yet they are responsible for other acts of evil, what would you do? What should you do? What is your duty as a citizen in such? What is the humane thing to do?<br /><br />Besides the beautiful presence of Winslet, some of the drama in THE READER is easier to bear because of the lovely scenery and great cinematography.  There are moments that this motion picture seems to stop and the action on the screen seems to become a portrait of life captured in a moment of time.  Sometimes art-house type films (which THE READER is--though a very popular one) use good cinematography to cover up for a weak script or bad acting. That's not the case with this movie and instead of distracting from the action of the movie, these elements enhances it.<br /><br />Though there are moments of happiness and vitality, THE READER is not a happy movie and, therefore, will not appeal to some people.  However, if you don't mind a deep-message movie full of drama and great acting with beautiful scenery and cinematography, then you might want to take a couple hours out of an evening and spend time with THE READER.ppy movie and, therefore, will not appeal to some people.

031606792X|5.0|Like so many other readers I became instantly and irrevocably in love with this series. I read the entire series front to back in a matter of hours (fast reader). At first, like many readers, I had a great deal of trouble with this book. I mean seriously some of it was a bit much to swallow. Then I went back and read this book by itself... I tried to read this the way I believe the author would have intended it to come out. I realized that these characters did a great deal of growing in the other books. I myself am not a great fan of people constantly being in pain to justify thier love. However in this book it seems that all that pain comes to something. Although it may not be what I expected or even what I would have done... Well its not my book and it wasn't my place. I think the author did a fantastic job of bringing all the story together and leaving a great place for a new beginning. I don't think of it as the end at all which I think in a way is what the author had in mind. It was a shock at first and I honestly didn't think I would like it, but as it turns out it was a redeemable story that showed a family growing together and growing up.    Add In:  It has been a while since I read this book and in retrospect when compared to the ROMANCE genre this series itself has characters that are well...KIDS if anyone has ever lived or breathed around a seventeen year old teenager than they understand this series. They are somewhat self absorbed, self centered and well kids. These books were geared towards them and it hits the mark. But as I stated above this series and especially this book shows that they will grow and that they will mature. It gives the impression that they will be able to handle whatever they are given. At first they start out as kids, then they become something more, and I believe they reach their potential and hope to see at least one follow up story just to tie up and get a glimpse of the future for this WHOLE family.
B00008FCXO|2.0|This 180 gram vinyl reissue was made from the digital master they use to make the CD's. It sounds just like the CD, dull and flat. All the imperfections from the CD are on here also. On Time Out Of Mind the sound drops out in several spots just like the CD. If you want this LP just hunt down an original pressing from 1980. Don't waste your money like I did. Its sad because this is one the greatest albums ever.
B000077VOY|5.0|I have vague memories of watching this show when it was first broadcast in the U.S.  At that time I was still too young to understand the plots.  Watching it as an adult (and in color, yet) was a revelation.  45 years later, it still looks great.  The puppeteering, which pushed the technological envelope as far as possible for 1964; the top-notch voice acting; the detailed miniatures; the frequently clever plots, which pack a lot of action into a half-hour's running time; the amusing pop-culture references; the gorgeous costumes (check out Atlanta's kimono in the extras section on disk 5); the sets, which are designed down to the smallest detail--the amount of work, sweat, and love which went into this series is staggering.    Does this show still work for kids?  Recently I screened the first few episodes for my cousin's 2 daughters (ages 6 and 8) and they were enthralled.  They didn't care about the visible marionette wires.  (They also didn't care for X2-Zero and the mechanical fish; but booing the villains in a melodrama is par for the course).  Why does this show, which by all rights should appear obsolete to an audience weaned on the latest CGI from Pixar and Dreamworks, still rock?  If I had to boil it down to one word that word would be: charm.  Stingray is charming.  There is just something about watching real flesh-and-blood puppets (so to speak) moving about a real (if miniature) set which CGI cannot match.  It's the same quality which makes Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animated critters so beloved by so many.  The physicality of it is seductive--it can make us believe, if only for the duration of a show, in a kind of childhood magic: that a plaything, a construction of metal, plastic and cloth can live and speak.

While not a spectacular as the Japanese mono version, the German pressing of this product, or the UK white vinyl (product of the famed Neumann lathe) this is a remarkable pressing, especially because it arrived pristine-- unplayed. Long live the LP record; other media have their advantages, but there is nothing like sonic range, presence, and warmth. Sure, there are CDs that are spectacular but generally speaking the Capitol Beatles' CDs do not convey enough of  their unique body of work. Don't get me going on the compressed personal music player soundstuffers that everyone walks around plugged into. Upgrade your speakers and let the guitars weep.

She grew up as a misfit in her family, being very smart she took care of herself, but found a love for reading she traveled between her home and the library everyday until she was able to go to school.    Her family, one mother uncaring and I would even go so far as saying self-absorbed person, and with a father that is a cheat and a swindler doesn't care for her, thus she is left to fend for herself.     Only by luck her one dream comes true, to go to school, mind you its not the 'best' school in the world since its run by the most evil principle in the world, There she meets and befriends her teacher, a sweet woman named Miss Honey.    The story follows that even a child that might have been born into a cruel and uncaring family, can turn out to be one of the most sweeties and smarties girls in the school.     With jokes and prat falls for everyone to know and understand, Matilda is truly a family friendly movie and I would recommend it for anyone that would like a feel good Happy ending kinda movie for there kids that doesn't have any real type of heavy violence.     It truly is very enjoyable for all ages.
0440244870|1.0|I bought this book because it seemed like a topic I would enjoy.  Instead, I could barely finish this book out of sheer irritation.<br /><br />Normally, when I find a book I like, I cannot stop reading.  The world comes to an abrupt halt.  I can usually finish the book withing a day!<br /><br />With this particular book, I kept slamming the book down time after time whenever Rebecca did something stupid.  This character has no morals and no redeeming characteristics. It took me over a month to finish reading it, and this was only after I forced myself.  Don't waste your time or money unless you like reading about selfish, self centered liars as main characters.
B001FB55MG|5.0|Skeeter Bronson (Adam Sandler) is the maintenance man at a luxury hotel in Los Angeles.  True, when his father sold the location to hotel mogul Barry Nottingham (Richard Giffiths), Barry promised to make Skeeter the manager when he grew up.  But that's never happened.  And now Barry has plans to build an even bigger hotel in the area and make Kendall (Guy Pearce) the manager.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Skeeter's sister calls.  Wendy (Courtney Cox) needs Skeeter to watch her two kids while she is out of town looking for a new job.  Skeeter hasn't had any contact with them for four years, but he agrees.<br /><br />That night, he tells the kids a bedtime story that gets pretty crazy.  And yet the next day, it seems to come true.  Excited, Skeeter can't wait for the next bedtime story.  Has he figured out a way to make his every wish come true or is something else at work here?<br /><br />I'm not normally an Adam Sandler fan, but the previews for this movie intrigued me so much, I just had to see it.  And I'm glad I did.  There were laughs all the way through.  In fact, I'd say the best laughs weren't spoiled in the previews.  Bugsy, the hamster, has some hilarious antics.  And the story gets so crazy at times you can't help but laugh.<br /><br />Yet the laughs are supported by a decent story.  Yes, the broad outline is predictable, but the journey to the end is fun, so you really don't care.  Beside, the kids add a few random plot points to the film, which keep things from being too stale.<br /><br />The stories that Skeeter tells vary greatly in location.  I was actually surprised at just how elaborate those sets were.  They didn't spare any expense with this film.<br /><br />My only complaint is what appears to be a dropped plot point.  It was a sub-plot, but I really was looking for it to be paid off.<br /><br />But that is a minor complaint.  This is a fun film that left me with a smile on my face.  It should entertain kids of all ages.

0380730405|4.0|Love Plays An Important Part, But This Is Not A 'Romance Novel'<br /><br />I really enjoyed Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier.<br /><br />Mr. Maxim de Winter is vacationing in Monte Carlo when he meets our narrator who is employed as a lady's companion to the perfectly dreadful, Mrs. Van Hopper.  When Mrs. Hopper falls ill our nameless narrator falls in love with Mr. De Winter and marries him.<br /><br />Once they return to England and his home, the beautiful and renown Manderley, she discovers that she is haunted by the former Mrs. de Winter, who is ever present despite that fact that she is dead.<br /><br />What does it do to your confidence to be constantly compared to  someone who came before you?<br /><br />My reading was periodically interrupted by various things from the real world (preparing meals, packing lunches, doing laundry, how annoying) and each time I was interrupted I was anxiously wondering what was going to happen to the de Winters?  How would things work themselves out?<br /><br />The author creates a lush and vivid setting.  I thought the words were beautiful and the story telling was wonderful.  The characters were well drawn the situations and dialogue realistic.  It was all very very enjoyable.  I would have loved more.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed in the specific copy that I chose to read.  I'm always aware of how many pages I have left to read.  I knew the book ended at page 410 so when the story itself ended on page 386 I was a bit surprised.  The remaining pages were a letter from the editor, a note from the author, an article that the author had previously published and the original epilogue, much of which was included in the first chapter of the book.  I wish I had known.<br /><br />This would be a wonderful book for a book club.<br />I will be reading more of Daphne Du Maurier.
B000002UA9|5.0|I wanted to take this time to let you know that word has officially come out through Apple Records/EMI that the Beatles british catalog has been digitally remastered with all twelve original albums on CD being re-released in stereo on September 9, 2009. The album Magical Mystery Tour, which became part of the Beatles CD catalog in 1987, will be included and the two CD's Past Masters Vol. 1 and Past Masters Vol. 2 will be combined into one CD set. The CD's will be available individually or as a box set also being released on the same day. All the Beatles albums are masterpieces in their own right, and now for the first time, Beatles fans can hear the first four albums (Please Please Me, With The Beatles, A Hard Days Night, Beatles For Sale) on CD in stereo. It might be worth waiting until September to get the stereo releases of these classic Beatles albums here on Amazon.

B001R7IHA0|5.0|This album will take you on a journey of love!!  Some songs will grab you right away--Sweet Thing & Kiss a Girl come to mind.  Others just draw you in with the rhythm & speaks right to your heart--If Ever I Could Love & `Til Summer Comes Around are the ones for me.  This album is a \\"feel good\\" album if there ever was one!!  Keith doesn't disappoint on this album!!  He gives us several longer songs with amazing guitar work & of course leaves you wanting to hear more.  Grab this album now & be ready to be inspired by the artistry of Keith Urban!!!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|What a movie!!! Great movies usually have two or three lines you had memorized after seeing it. The Breakfast Club have two and many more. What a great cast to protray what a Saturday afternoon in detention would be like although I haven't experienced that in my time in high school. Judd Nelson's performance as John blows me away as the burnout. One of the best lines in the whole movie is Ally Sheedy telling them her reason for being there in Saturday detention; \\"I had nothing better to do.\\" The movie is awesome and another great movie by John Hughes. The cast is absolutely stellar!! Two thumbs way up!!!

B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a great little flash unit. It's the perfect lightweight flash for the small and light D40 camera. It's more powerful that the D40's built-in flash, it powers up and cycles quickly, and yet it's amazingly economical on batteries. I wish that the nifty little case that it came with had a loop so you could attach it to your camera strap, but the SB-400 fits inside a vest or jacket quite easily.

How the search engine decided \\"Lord Jim\\" had any relation to Jack Lord completely mystifies me.    Jack Lord is NOT, nor ever was, in \\"Lord Jim.\\"    Somebody needs to clean up its search options so that what someone searches for is what one WANTS, and doesn't get a whole bunch of other stuff that has nothing whatever to do with the search.    Amazon, tsk.
B001DJLCPO|1.0|Had I been in Haight-Ashbury during the '60s, I probably would have described this film as a bad trip....mostly unpleasant and not entertaining in the least. Today this is what passes for art, but only amongst the artist's peers and relatives, as the majority of people will just consider this to be a waste of time and money.
B001JDS7CU|5.0|Great series! Couldn't have asked for crisper pictures and clearer sound! Glad we went with the narration by Sir David Attenbourgh, hands down it much better.
0312539517|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" Jeffrey Archer a few months ago and thoroughly enjoyed both \\"Prisoner of Birth\\" and \\"Sons of Fortune\\" so I eagerly began reading \\"Paths of Glory\\" as soon as it was in my possession.  The story did not disappoint and it resulted in a number of late nights reading when I should have been sleeping.  The novel chronicles the life of the heroic George Mallory and how he came to lead two expeditions to climb Mt Everest.  My only (very minor) complaint is that the author never gave any indication as to how much of the story was fact and how much was fiction.  For example it would have been nice to have known if the many letters that George wrote to Ruth -- which contributed immensely to the book -- were actual letters that he had written to her.  Again, that is a minor point and not one that would prevent my from highly recommending this book.
B001GQACGO|3.0|The Good: This is Beyonce's best album (in my opinion). I applaud her for trying to step out of her comfront zone and do something different. Songs like \\"Disappear\\" and \\"Smash Into You\\" is simply beautiful and peaceful. It also seems to me Beyonce is working on her tone because her voice sounds clear, strong, but light. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"Ego\\" are good uptempo songs because she is actually using showing characteristic in her singing and relying less on hip hip.    The Bad: Beyonce is using alot of styles, ideas, and images from other artists. \\"Diva\\" comes from Lil Wanye. \\"Halo\\" comes from Leona Lewis. \\"Ava Marie\\" comes from an opera tune and Beyonce does not pull this song off very well. Beyonce is even using and re-hashing her own styles. The song \\"Single Ladies\\" is nothing more but \\"Get Me Bodied\\" part 2.     The Ugly: Beyonce...stop the business of releasing standard and deluxe versions. It makes you look greedy, especially since you only put 11 songs on the standard and only 16 songs on the deluxe. Nowadays, a standard release is 14-16 songs, while a deluxe version is 18-20 songs.    In the end: Some people are saying Beyonce has lost steam or she has lost her way. Personally, I like the fact Beyonce is challenging herself to do something different. What is sad is after \\"If I Were A Boy/Single Ladies\\", the album has lost its steam. \\"Diva/Halo\\" are not doing as well and as a result, I fear Beyonce may return to her comfront zone for her next album in order to have more success.

And she can get the disk out without abusing it. I hope this packaging becomes dominate while physical media still exist.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|I actually enjoyed Quantum Of Solace,the action and plot in this film was better than Casino Royale.The director took a different course than usual with this film and made Bond more like Jason Bourne,you don't know if he is a good guy or a bad guy.There are less beautiful women in this film but the action makes up for that.Sure Quantum isn't perfect but it's more exciting than watching a bunch of men playing cards.  The picture and sound on the DVD version is awesome,the studio did an excellent job transferring it.The DTS track is loud and very detailed compared to the DD track.
0307120007|2.0|This \\"Pat the Bunny\\" book is exactly like the one I got for my boys 20 years ago when they were small. It's cute and inventive, but it is NOT sturdy enough for toddlers. Ours fell apart right away. Also the story and activities were not especially engaging for my boys. If you do buy it, I suggest that you put it out of the child's reach after you read it. Or buy high-quality board books instead.     As an aside, couple of terrific bunny-books that I recommend for youngsters are: \\"The Country Bunny and the Golden Shoes\\", (I can't say enough praises about this it, though it was published in 1939!), and \\"Home for a Bunny\\", a beautiful Golden Book. The story is sweet, and the illustrations so beautiful that I still love to look at them. Amazon has the \\"big version\\" which is hard backed. The \\"Country Bunny\\" is sold in the soft-cover version here.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is a bilingual British-Indian production based on the novel \\"Q & A\\" by Loveleen Tandan, which I understand has been modified considerably be screenwriter Simon Beaufoy. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is an 18-year-old tea-server originally from the slums of Mumbai. In an attempt to reach the woman he loves (Freida Pinto), he becomes a contestant on the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\\". He gets so close to the grand prize of 20 million rupees that he is suspected of cheating and arrested. He tries to convince a jaded police inspector (Irfan Khan) that he really did know the answer to the questions by recounting the episodes in his life from which he learned them.<br /><br />This is an optimistic romance that is coy about being either of those things most of the time. It generates a lot of energy but has a startling edge. The audience is hit full force with Jamal's violent life as a street child. Shifts back and forth in time, between Jamal's interrogation, his appearance on the show, and his recollections of years past can be jarring at first. But the frenetic energy of it all matches that of the slums and of life on the run for Jamal and his brother Salim. Irfan Khan can play any role, and he is terrific here as a detective whose patience is wearing thin but whose curiosity gets the better of him, even though he's not such a nice guy.<br /><br />There have been a lot of sleazy characters in Jamal's life, and the film is populated with them. Jamal is the proverbial nice guy from the wrong side of the tracks who has been hindered by circumstances and unscrupulous people. Yet he is savvy and single-minded. His brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) is almost Jamal's alter-ego, a bully who chose a life of crime to get ahead. But he is equally savvy and single-minded, with a different value system. The love-hate relationship between the two men brings a lot of substance to the story. \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\"'s amalgamation of gritty reality, upbeat rhythms, and clich&eacute;d optimism make it a unique, enjoyable experience. In English and Hindi with subtitles that are part of the film, not superimposed.chéd optimism make it a unique, enjoyable experience.

B001CDLATE|5.0|Breathtaking is one word I use when telling people about this movie.  I put this in my Blu Ray player and from the very first menu image I was blown away!<br /><br />Being able to see these cultures and they way they live is something you wont forget.  Most of us get up in the morning, have coffee, read the paper, etc...well scrap all that and head to the most remote areas on earth, where ritual dances and ceremonial cremations are still performed!<br /><br />I was a huge fan of Planet Earth, but this movie with no Narration is top notch!  The BD is a real treat with stunning visuals, and incredible sound (watch the special features, the sound guy did some pretty amazing stuff!) If you want to see how things are outside your own backyard you owe it to yourself to purchase this movie.<br /><br />Also on a side note, they did away with the cardboard sleeve and gave us an actual blue BD case!  ENJOY!

B0009A40ES|5.0|Back in the 80s, I worked in executive dining rooms in Los Angeles. Major stock brokerages and law firms, for the most part. It's amazing how well that Yuppie era was recreated. The film influenced me to read the book, which is a wonderful expansion of the film. The commentary tracks are very entertaining. Overall, I found the movie to be a terrific horror roller-coaster. The characters were believable, just a couple of degrees away from the real people I dealt with daily when Reagan was king.
0156030209|4.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" by Yann Martel is a book definitely worth reading. No matter how you take it- as an allegory to God and faith or at face value- the metaphors are beautiful and the passages are so descriptive, even if graphic at times, that one can easily picture the scenes. It is as if the reader is taking the journey with Pi.      I know some readers argue that this story is unrealistic, but remember, it is a work of fiction. Also, while Richard Parker is Pi's beloved companion, Pi never acts as if the tiger is harmless. To the contrary, he devises several plans to save himself from the tiger before deciding that keeping him alive is the best option (166). Also, remember in the first part, he talks about the importance of establishing territory (43). Pi had reached the lifeboat first, thus Richard Parker instinctively realized that it was Pi's territory. This, and the fact that he was a zoo animal who knows Pi increases Pi's chance of survival. Nevertheless, he never denies the miracle of his survival, against the tiger, against the sharks, against the water and against the elements.     As for it being impossible to be a Hindu, Muslim and Christian at the same time, sure, it is very hard to be a Hindu and the other two religions at the same time. After all, Islam and Christianity require belief in one God, while Hinduism requires belief in several Gods. However, it is possible to believe in tenets that these religions, such as peace and love, share. Perhaps the reason Pi unconsciously calls Richard Parker to the lifeboat at first is that he prefers companionship, any companionship, to being alone. This idea is represented in the carnivorous island and the fact that he considers the previous inhabitant's death might have occurred from loneliness. I was originally thinking that Richard Parker might represent God, i.e., a source of comfort but also capable of taking our lives at any moment, but then I realized that when he leave the lifeboat without so much as a backward glance at Pi, this would imply that God abandons us. This implication would be contradictory to Pi's belief in God as a friend who is always with us. Then again, this could also be God saying, \\"I've helped you as much as you need, now it's time to gigure things out on your own.\\" This idea, however, fits in more with Deism, i.e., the belief that God created the world and everything and everyone in it, but has no control over it today, which is not the same as the beliefs of Hinduism, Islam and Christianity that Pi practices. Interestingly, Martel chooses one of the least social animals to be Pi's companion, which could be another way of saying, \\"Yeah, I'm here for you, but I want you to be independent as well.\\"      Like other posters, I like that Pi embraces atheists as his \\"brothers\\" and puts atheism on the same wheel as believers in God, rather than the two being complete opposites. However, I'm not sure I agree with his assessment that an atheist would see a white life and possibly have a deathbed leap of faith, while an agnostic would probably say, \\"Possibly a f-f-failing oxygenation of the b-b-brain\\" (64). Since the definition of an agnostic is \\"one who is not sure whether or not there is a God\\", it would follow more logically that the agnostic would have the deathbed leap of faith while the atheist would go for the scientific explanation until the end.       Interesting defense of zoos, good to hear the other side, i.e., why zoos are good for animals and why being in the wild isn't.       Overall, a great book despite some flaws. I would recommend it to anyone interested in reading it.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this disturbing film. Listening to the Director's Commentary gave some wonderful insights to shoestring budget movie making as well.
0525421033|5.0|I truly love this book.  It makes me smile and makes me cry.  This is definitely not a book for teens only; people of all ages will love it!  There hasn't been a touching little book like this for so long.  I personally think it's even better than THE LOVELY BONE.
B00127RAJY|5.0|[[ASIN:B00127RAJY Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred]]    My favorite thing about this workout video is that the workouts are only 20 minutes long.  During my first workout I couldn't wait for those 20 minutes to be over.  THIS IS A WORKOUT!!!!!      I would be considered a beginner for the purposes of workout videos.  Jillian explains how you can modify some of the workouts to be more accomodating to a beginner.  I have knee issues so I had to take it easy on some of the lunging activities, but I totally worked up a sweat and there was no doubt the following day as to which muscles got the most workout.    If you like Jillian Michael's you will like this video.
0061122416|5.0|I believe that this is my favorite book of all time.  I have given it to many people and with very few exceptions have found that they love it also.  I like this book because it reminds us to look at the journey and to see the value in that, it encourages us to take risks for what is really important, it is a book that I find inspiring.
B00005LQ04|5.0|If you're on the fence about whether you'll enjoy Argento, or Suspiria more specifically, do me a favor: Watch the first 20 minutes of the film.  It's among the best opening 20 minutes of not just horror films, but any film, period.  It's with this barometer that you will either dive into Argento or shy away from him for the rest of your life.<br /><br />I hadn't heard of Argento until the late 90's as Dvd was taking hold.  Having grown up in the hey day of slashers, the early 80's, one would think I would have been an Argento fan but back in those days the Italian horror masters rarely got films released here in the states.  When this three disc edition of Suspiria was first released, I bought it and set aside a Friday night to watch my first Argento feature.  I was hooked from the first beats of Goblins outstanding soundtrack.  Then the cinematography floored me.  The color palette was phenomenal and finally the too beautiful to be disgusting violence had me entrapped.  I was never the same after seeing this film, and have now collected Dario Argento's entire catalog.<br /><br />Argento is like a painter in some respects.  Each scene is brilliantly laid out to get the most mileage out of his canvas.  He's among the finest directors I've seen when it comes to perspective and negative space.  And where this really hits home is in the kill scenes.  Splashes of red fly across the screen, body parts are mutilated, and the scenes go on for longer than should be humanly tolerable, but he makes it so great to look at, you just stare in sort of an admiring terror.  Where Lucio Fulci just grossed people out, Argento grosses you out without you noticing.  It's why I think he's the best horror director of all time, and I would put his top 5 films (Suspiria included) against any other horror directors.<br /><br />If I were to describe his visual style for contemporary audiences, I would say David Lynch, circa Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive meets John Carpenter, circa Halloween and The Thing.  In fact, if David Lynch ever went full on horror, I believe we would get Suspiria or inferno.<br /><br />If you're stale on horror of late and need something to shake you up, Argento does the trick.  If you're new to horror, it's highly recommended as a starting point into Argentos library.<br /><br />*The soundtrack rules, by the way, and it's included on a separate cd in this 3 disc edition.n fact, if David Lynch ever went full on horror, I believe we would get Suspiria or inferno.

0783225733|5.0|Many people expected Apollo 13 to be a \\"routine\\" mission to the moon.  If successful, it would have been the 3rd lunar landing.  The mission did not, however, turn out to be routine.  About 3/4 of the way to the moon a faulty piece of electronics caused an explosion that put the three-man crew in great danger.<br /><br />This movie does an outstanding job of telling the story of the astronauts on this mission, as well as of the NASA ground crew that had to solve problem after problem in order to find a way to have a chance of getting the crew home safely.<br /><br />Why this film is great:<br />1) The acting is top-notch.  With actors like Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, and Kevin Bacon, how could it NOT be?  The entire cast did an outstanding job.<br />2) This film is based on a true story that held the entire nation, perhaps the entire world, in its grip (and personally, I tend to prefer a good true story to a good fictional one)<br />3) The re-eneactements of the critical thinking and work of the NASA ground crew, scientists, and technicians added the realism needed to pull off a realistic telling of this story<br />4) I've visited the NASA Johnson Flight Center in Houston, and the original ground control room is still there (though there is now a new one that ground control uses).  I don't know if filming actually took place in that original flight control room, but it sure looked like it to me,  That also added to the realism.<br />5) The intertwined storylines, including the crew, the NASA ground staff, and the astronauts' families made for a gripping tale.<br />6) The music was awesome<br />7) Ron Howard is an AMAZING director.<br /><br />I can't really think of anything that would make me consider anything less than a 5-star rating for this amazing show.<br /><br />There is, you may want to know, a smattering of mild language scattered throughout the movie and a some innuendo, and one blurred shower scene  that I know I could have done without, adn that in my opinion didn't really add to the show.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a 5-star show through and through.Regardless, this is a 5-star show through and through.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|I'm a HUGE DK fan, but I can't recommend this release. I found it to be so bad at times that I actually started laughing, what a totally non-captivating, \\"mailed in\\" performance. New fans should check out the \\"Live In Paris\\" dvd and \\"Look Of Love\\" cd. Others already familiar with DK should probably just give their money to the homeless, they will actually appreciate the support rather than taking it for granted...
B001MYIXAW|5.0|A great, dark, and overall creepy thriller from Sweden.  This is one of the best cinematically finished films in a long time.  Throws out the glitz and romantics for old-fashioned vampire lore with subtle twists.  The acting is wonderful and the direction is fantastic.  It feels like it was made decades ago, and the young main stars of this film really impress.  A classic for many fans of the genre and couldn't be more unlike another recent vampire movie that has glittering teen-vamps.
0783229364|3.0|I remember when this movie came out in the late 1980's. Michael J. Fox was one of the iconic actors of that decade, famous for his portrayals as the stuffy but endearing Alex P. Keaton on TV's \\"Family Ties\\", as well as the in-over-his-head teen caught up in a time-travelling nightmare in \\"Back to the Future\\". It's safe to say that just about anything Michael J. Fox touched in this era was all but guaranteed gold. And there's nothing wrong with that. The kid always came across as a genuine article likeable guy, all-American, with a real penchant for bringing out belly laughs. And I think this is what made \\"The Secret of My Success\\" so \\"successful\\" during it's theatrical run, because viewed two decades later with all of this in it's proper context, the movie is cute but long in the tooth and really just not *that* funny. Spoilers ahead! Consider yourself warned!<br /><br />Fox portrays Brantley Foster, an idealistic small town college graduate from Kansas determined to move to NY City and make it big in the business world. Upon finding himself in the Big Apple the job he had lined up has been suddenly and unexpectedly axed, leading Foster into unemployment. He runs through the motions of trying to find another job until, desperate, he eventually goes to his distant uncle, Howard Prescott (played by the ever fantastic Richard Jordan), who just so happens to be CEO of a major company in NYC, for a job. After an impassioned speech to Prescott, Foster is given a job in the mailroom, where he befriends coworker Fred (John Pankow from \\"To Live and Die in LA\\") and comes under immediate suspicion from the mailroom boss. Pankow shows him the ropes and eventually Foster sees Christy Wills (played by \\"Supergirl\\" Helen Slater) in one of the most ridiculous water-fountain drinking sequences I have ever been subjected to. I know it's the whole \\"love at first sight thing\\", but really folks...it's just a water fountain! *rolls eyes*<br /><br />The plot thickens when Foster ends up doing a one day limo service for an executive's wife, Vera (Margaret Whitton from \\"Major League\\"), and after some awkward back and forth, she seduces him and, as the Bible puts it, he \\"knows\\" her. He discovers five minutes afterwards that it turns out Vera is Prescott's wife, making her Foster's aunt. Follow all that? :)<br /><br />Bear in mind we haven't even really touched upon the main theme of the film, namely what makes the \\"Secret\\" so \\"Successful\\", which basically involves Foster getting uppity and hijacking an empty office space for himself and taking on the role of an executive without anyone knowing it's all a sham.<br /><br />The movie has some truly funny moments (Foster's constant costume changing in the elevator is hilarious) but even Fox's charisma can't carry this film all the way through and after a while it turns into a series of mediocre slapstick moments tacked on to each other. The \\"room switching\\" scene in Prescott's mansion towards the end of the film exemplifies the problem. Here's a scene in which all the principals are trying to sneak off to various rooms to get their thing on with the other principals while simultaneously trying to not be seen en route there. It was a scene that was rife with comedic potential and it was squandered by poor pacing, lousy camera angles, unfunny slapstick, and very extended overuse of \\"Oh Yeah\\" by Yello (made famous by \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\". Oh Yeaaaah *bow bow chick...chicka chicka*), a song which is cool in small amounts but gratingly annoying when one is forced to endure it for several minutes at a time.<br /><br />On a personal note I found it rather hypocritical of Foster to go around accusing Prescott of cheating on his wife when Foster was \\"knowing\\" her himself. He goes to Prescott at the beginning of the movie, who gives him a chance in his company when he didn't *have* to (this is key), and yet Foster ultimately pays him back by getting him fired? I would say that capitalism works out its own bugswithout interference from outside forces but this just came across as a little to \\"personal\\" to me, and I felt that Foster simply did not have the proper motives for such animosity towards his benefactor (although Vera admittedly did). In fact, considering that Foster's  \\"success\\" was based entirely upon fraud I would think that there should have been at least *some* minor penalty for him. Instead he gets the CEO job, the girl, and does it all pretty dishonestly. Perhaps I make too much of it, but it deeply bothered me that I had seen it happen and with no consequence. I know...I know...it's just a movie. :P<br /><br />\\"Secret\\" was, to me, a fairly mediocre movie, filled with 80's synthesizer music (and a whole pile of \\"Oh Yeah\\" by Yello), occasionally funny moments, and the ever likeable Michael J. Fox. It's certainly worth of a rental but this is not one that I'll be rushing forward to put in my DVD collection anytime soon. It feels overlong for what it is and probably could have been condensed into a much shorter movie with much better effect.rces but this just came across as a little to \\"personal\\" to me, and I felt that Foster simply did not have the proper motives for such animosity towards his benefactor (although Vera admittedly did).

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is truly an eye catching, inspiring documentary on this incredible creation we live in and all the creatures we share it with.
B00003CX5P|2.0|The sad truth dawned on all of us watching Phantom Menace that this movie made Return of the Jedi look like Taxi Driver. With nothing but emotionless dialogue, bad acting from star Jake Lloyd and LONG gaps without any action Phantom pushes your patience. Add to that the tornado of annoyance that is Jar Jar Binks, and you have the weakest Star Wars movie in the saga. The menacing presence of Darth Maul is the only saving grace here, and the lightsaber duel is pretty impressive in it's own right. But the rest of the films flaws are just to much to suffer through. Kids will love it and it's great for introducing real young ones to the franchise, but otherwise just stick with the SW movies with Darth Vader on the cover.
B00006DEF9|5.0|This is a realy good classic. And wonderful restored I must say.<br />I just like the music and the performance of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor. This movie has nearly everything you would expect<br />from a movie like this. The classic scene of course never repeated when<br />Gene starts to dance in the puddles and the policeman is watching him ...

B001FB55H6|5.0|I had purchased the graphic novel of Watchmen a while before the movie came out and had read it when the movie came out.  The movie was absolutely amazing.  The visual effects were incredible, the acting was top notch, and the story followed as closely to the original concept as almost anything I've ever read.    I understand where all of the haters are coming from, questioning the morality or intent of this film.  Here is my rebuttal.. the story is supposed to question the impossible, make you think, stimulate those little hairs on the back of your neck.  This story is filled with philosophy and possibility.  These people are not trying to be Batman, Superman or Spider-Man.  It bears a very slight resemblance to the darkness that is Moore's Batman, but not even close character or plot wise.    To sum up, this film is terrific in my opinion.  It stays as true to the original story as possible and kept me entertained all the way through.  I will agree that if you have not read the comic book you will find it somewhat difficult to follow some of the story.  Dr. Manhattan is naked through a lot of the graphic novel so the movie simply stayed true to the comic book there.  The dry humor and gore maintained the integrity of the graphic novel as well.  Check this movie out, if only by renting it, but just bask in the cinematic glory that is this film.  Pay attention to the little things and you will enjoy this movie as I did.

B001TK3XO0|5.0|My heart and mind are still racing, having just finished listening to Khaled Hosseini's breathtaking epic novel A Thousand Splendid suns. All week, I have been commuting with anxious nerves, shaking with rage, or tears running down my cheeks, as I have been making my way through this marvelous story of two women spanning several decades of Afghanistan's tumultuous recent history. The two women, whose stories begin many years and hundreds of miles apart, come together in a surprising and inspiring way. The epic tale not only spans the monarchy, the communists, the warlords, the Taliban, and beyond, the horrors of a war-torn city, the despicable injustices of Islamist rule, conflicts of traditionalists versus the more modern-minded, and the conflicts between compassion and the cruel treatment of women and illegitimate children under cover of traditional Afghan and Muslim codes of honor. Hosseini illustrates these grand themes with an engrossing story and vivid memorable characters. I loved his descriptions of children, how they perceived the people around them, and how those perceptions changed as they matured. The recurring themes of memory were hauntingly poignant, how even the greatest memories can be like trying to hold water in your fingers, but also how the memory of someone lost who once shaped us can mark us indelibly and affect us years later. And it is also the story of a city, Kabul, vividly described, once a place where children played in the streets and women gossiped around a communal tandoor, then later a place where people hid inside as rockets and bullets strafed the city skies, and then later the place where religious fanatics enforced beards on men, burqas on women (never unaccompanied), and prohibited music and kite-flying. While there is a lot of sorrow and pain in this story (how could there not be?), Maryam and Laila persist and inspire. Their spirit is like a weed growing up from a dry river bed toward the sun, despite being parched by droughtand torn by artillery fire, there is a dignity and beauty in its endurance. Though the book ended in a very fitting place, I was sorry to see it end, as I am reluctant to let go of its characters. I think I will remember them for a long time.
B000QTCXIW|5.0|Thanks for asking my opinion.  Beyoncé's \\"B'day\\" makes for excellent listening. I believe that she has matured vocally with her renditions of the songs.      I believe it's fantastically music sensation!  It rocks and her rendition of \\"Get Me Bodied\\" (extended version) is really out of sight.  I also like her slower songs.  They also show vocal range.  Thanks!
B000NA28I4|1.0|I really wanted to scream out everything wrong with the movie when I watched it--\\"You know Brom's horse was WHITE in the book!\\" \\"Arya is and E-L-F! Ya know, POINTED EARS?!?\\" It was a very poor substitite for the     R-E-A-L Eragon. Here are the Huge downsides to it:   - You idiots! Arya is an elf!! And may I remind you, Eragon rescued her UNCONSCIOUS, in a prision cell, in Gil'ead!    - They didn't even visit Dras Leona or Yauzac! No Hadarac Desert, No Isidar Mithrim!    - Brom and Eragon practically hate each other in the movie, in the book there was a lot more with brom and Eragon, and when Brom died you're just like, \\"Big Deal, nothing special!!!\\"    - The stupid directors just put some armor, tough expression & beard on some people and called em' Dwarves. And whatever happened to Hrothgar?   - What about Murtagh? Oh, he was only there for 5 minutes, Murtagh was a huge part of the book, and now he's like as important as dust.     - Saphira changed from baby dragon to adult dragon in 2 seconds!!! Stupid.   - Saphira couldn't even breathe fire in the first book! And she won the battle by just doing that.     It infuriated me to see a great book thrown into a stupid movie. If you have read Eragon and go watch this movie, believe me, you will be sobbing or screaming your head off by the end of the movie.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|After the success of 'Confessions' it would be hard for the Queen of Pop to recreate another dance influenced album with such perfection, although with Madonna nothing is impossible. 'Hard Candy' will not blow you away as 'Confessions' did but on the other hand it is a totally different genre within the dance genre, a more Urban, R&B, Hip Hop, Dance fusion a lot more street than her first R&B attempt \\"Bedtimes Stories\\" (another great overlooked album)This album came at a very difficult period in my life, so I needed a fun, uplifting kind of music in my life, Madonna did that for me. I liked the album, but grew to love it with every listen. A great CD to work out too.    Candy Shop: I love this track, Madonna invites us into her Candy Shop, she offers various kinds of delights, only suckers are not what she sells in her store, but her chocolates kisses will make you beg for more. A clever play on words, a simple opening track, but an uplifting listen.4/5    4 Minutes: A good track in my opinion too radio friendly, I am not a huge Justin fan but he is talented, a great hard beat, an amazing video, I grew to love the song. 4/5    Give it 2 me: One of my favourites, great work by Pharell, great video as well, we all know this one, a funky dance track, with rediculours beats as we expect from Pharell, makes you wanna get stupid.5/5    Heart Beat: I like this track Madonna expresses her love for dance and how it makes her feel beautiful, great beats by Pharell once again also adding some cool backing vocals, she did an amazing performance for it on her Sticky and Sweet Tour (You Tube). 4/5    Miles Away: I love this track, it's probably one of the few tracks that is most personal to her, she basis it on her relationship with ex-hubby Guy Ritchie, who only seems to love her more when she is Miles Away, \\"You always love more, miles away, I hear it in your voice when you're miles away, you're not afraid to tell me, miles away, I guess we're at our best when we're miles away\\", that's pretty sad, its a simple song, but there is something about it (sing a long vibe) that makes it one of my favourites, just like \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" on her 'Like a Prayer' album, she reveals to the world the ups and downs of being married which Madonna rarely does, to reveal lack of control in her personal life. 5/5    She's not me: A great track although I somewhat grew out of it after a couple of listens, it is a sassy track, Madonna knows she is all that regardless of her age and new blood in the industry, no one can be her, so in Madonna style she reminds them little wannabes that you'll never have my name. 3/5    Incredible: I heard this song is about her ex, a much more positive vibe, she expresses her love for him dearly, I believe Madonna wanted this marriage to work with all her heart, a great track, interesting beats, another Pharell experience. 4/5    Beat goes on: One of the most grooviest tracks on the album, love her voice on this track, Kanye West does an amazing rap to an amazing beat, check out the performance on You Tube of this track on her 'Sticky and Sweet Tour' amazing. 4/5    Dance2night: Another groovy track, groovy beat, I like this song its cool, another track that I grew to love, she collaborates with Justin again, it definetely has his feel, but it works. 4/5    Spanish Lesson: Okay this track is alright, the part I really like is the break down where she says \\"If you do your homework, maybe I will give you more\\", otherwise it probably is the weak song of the bunch, the lyrics are a little odd. 3/5    Devil Wouldn't Recognise You: I love this track, I grew to love it, yes it does have that Justin feel, but it is a Timbaland production and that is his sound. The beat is amazing, the vocals are great, I can see Madonna in all black doing an amazing video to this track something like \\"The Power of Good bye\\" but with a hard edge. I love this track. 5/5    Voices: A beautiful closing track to end a great album, Madonna tends to endher albums on a gentle tip, \\"Like it or not\\"(Confessions), \\"Easy Ride\\" (American Life), \\"Gone/American pie\\" (Music), she does the same with another gentle beauty, I like this track a lot. 4/5    All in all Hard Candy set out and did what it was meant to do, and thats not to beat the likes of \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" or \\"Ray of Light\\" but to introduce another side of Madonna, prooving that she can be Urban as well as a Rocker.
B000ZI8E5K|2.0|I have read the book twice, I really like it.  The audio CD is terrible.  It has two glaring faults.   First, it is read far too fast.  It sounds as if they had 60 minutes of material and only 45 minutes of recording time, read far too fast.  Second, their is virtually no content.  All they reader does is read list after list.  1st...2nd...3rd.  For chapter after chapter.    If you haven't read the book, you would have absolutely no idea how to use the skills the author teaches.   A real disappointment.
B000002LFZ|4.0|I lost most of my Fleetwood Mac in a Burglary a while back, and recently I came across this CD and grabbed it without reading which songs were included.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, all the songs on the CD are very good, they are I'm sure the biggest hits for the band. It is just that it doesn't have many of the songs that I consider to be the best from the masters of \\"Pop Rock\\". To name a few of the songs missing here, \\"The Chain\\" \\"Songbird\\" \\"Crystal\\" \\"I Go Insane\\".<br /><br />However, this set is good enough that I am convinced that I need to buy some of the albums again, and this will tide me over in the mean time.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Am a huge Krall fan. Have her prior CDs and have seen her in concert a few times...love her jazz interpretations. Was eager to have this new CD. Bought one for me and one for a gift. Sadly, this CD nearly put me to sleep. Where did her energy and jazz interpretation go??? Throughout, most songs didn't even sound like DK...with her breathy, whispery tone.  I am returning the \\"gift\\" copy I bought...just can't pass it on.  Before hearing this CD I had just purchased tickets to one of her concerts for later this summer. Now I am wondering if this concert will be a replica of the CD!!  Am wishing I hadn't purchased tickets!!  Hoping in concert she will bring back the jazzy Diana, including her playfulness with lyrics and piano, that we have all come to love...Pleeeze!!! I would not recommend \\"Quiet Nights\\" unless you truly needing help getting to sleep....
B001TODCII|5.0|My favorite Clint Eastwood line from all of his movies was from the film \\"Absolute Power\\" when he says \\"when you went after my little girl, well that was completely unacceptable\\"  Every daddy of a daughter, I think can relate that there is nothing that would be off limits in getting your daughter out of similar circumstances as portrayed in the film. Most of us would lack the skills and resources to pull off the heroics, but not the resolve.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is  still a great action hero, my wife and I have loved him since we first watched \\"Rob Roy\\" many years ago, and he is flawless here as a retired agent who wants nothing as bad as having a relationship with his daughter before it's too late.<br /><br />\\"I was a preventer.\\"<br />\\"What what did you prevent?\\"<br />\\"I prevented bad things from happening\\"<br /><br />This is a great action movie!

B001CW7ZXA|2.0|Buyer Take Note! I've been a fan of this movie since its theatrical release in 1978 and give the movie five stars. However, National Lampoon's Animal House 30th Anniversary Edition (30AE) is simply a re-release, and the third dip on DVD, has nothing significantly new to offer from the previous release and my rating is for the 30AE release. The two documentary extras have been carried over from the 2003 Double Secret Probation Edition (DSPE). It does return the trailer from the 1998 Collector's Edition (CE). New to this release is a lame Scene It? game. Missing are two extras from the DSPE, the Shout music video and a text commentary of anecdotes. One improvement from the DSPE is that on the 30AE you are not forced to watch movie trailers before you get to the main menu. Universal appears to be repackaging this film every five years. The 30AE should have delivered all the previous extras and an audio commentary by the director, writers and cast. The trailer is amusing, but is it worth buying the 30AE if you already own the DSPE? The deciding factors appear to be whether you want the text commentary and everything on one disc or the trailer and the same contents spread over two discs. I would say skip the 30AE if you already own the DSPE. Maybe in five years we will get an ultimate edition of this movie on whatever video format is in use then.

B001PR0Y4Y|2.0|Growing up in the 1980's I thought this may be a fun flick to see as it was listed under 'comedy'.    The characters are surface deep and the acting was terrible.  Stewart has limited facial expressions so you need to try to guess what she's feeling.    Touches on drug use, drinking, extra-marital sex and drunk driving - but with no 'lessons learned'.  Don't waste your time or money, it wasn't funny - it was pathetic.
1555175163|4.0|Although a fascinating read, filled with many photos of Ip Man that I had never seen before, it was not as much of a biography as I had thought.    I was personally very interested in Ip Man's life in Foshan before HK and this book only touches upon it in the initial chapters, before following with chapters about his principles and examples of them in the forms of entertaining stories.     The book provides a deep portrait of the master, however it is the size of a children's novel, very short in length (a paragraph or two per chapter) and many of the pages are filled with photos (not a bad thing).
0762434279|1.0|I thoroughly agree with George Helber's review.  Who would have thought that Amazon's offering of a \\"book\\" would consist of a little ~ 2x3 inch item?  Maybe the \\"real\\" book has value, but caveat emptor on this particular version - worthless. Well, my family derived worth from the look on my face when I opened the package; everyone had a good laugh.
B001F7MSFM|3.0|Hellboy II has a good story line and stays the course of it, The actors are clearly more comfortable with their characters who have grown considerably since Hellboy. There is also a terrific back and understory which continues to develop throughout, enticing the viewer with interest in seeing the continuing story. (I hope Hellboy III is forthcoming and won't prove to be another \\"HP and the HBP\\" or \\"Golden Compass\\" which have yet to hit the screens.)
B001PR0XYA|5.0|Vikings against Aliens?   How cool is that?  I thought the movie was well done, certainly well, well above the level of a Sci-Fi Channel movie.  The acting was good. We actually come to care about the characters. The sets and atmosphere were cool.  The monster looked a little CGI-ish but who cares?  It's a really solid movie if you like this sort of thing.  A worthy addition to the tradition of the first Predator movie, certainly.  The movie also evoked for me ROAD WARRIOR (outsider comes to save them and the outsider is befriended by a boy) and PLANET OF THE APES (not the Tim Burton disgrace).  It evokes a lot of good stuff but has it own identity as a film.  I just totally dug this.   I know the movie has some baggage but it would be great to see some sequels.  There is definitely room for more and hopefully not just rehashes of the first one. There is more to this movie than people would think.  Thumbs up!
B0025MVXPC|5.0|I read this book 45 years ago and what has stuck with me all this time was my astonishment in how Laura's sister Mary savored any little pleasure that came her way.  I had more in my life than Mary could have dreamed of yet, it was I who envied her. The sheer delight she derived from even a single piece of peppermint candy was something I had never experienced. I learned a valuable lesson and to this day I pity anyone  who takes life's little pleasures for granted as the joy those little girls felt will never be theirs.<br />I have read the entire Little House series several times over the years as have my children.  We lived within miles of Laura Ingalls Wilder's final home, where she and Almonzo raised Rose and were laid to rest.  She was a remarkable woman and there is something very comforting about her words.  I believe she began writing at the age of 60 and it is apparent that she still viewed the world with the wonder of a child.  I hope the children of today will appreciate, enjoy and benefit from this book as much as I did.

B00004TJKI|4.0|Risqu&eacute; for its time, and certainly profound and entertaining; `Anatomy of a Murder' is a very well done courtroom drama with some excellent performances.  What's exceedingly nice about this film is that it ages very well, despite the change in times.  Sure, some of the court outbursts seem rather humorous to us today (beings that `panties' is a word only immature frat boys find funny) but the entirety of the film still rings very true, and the entertainment value has not diminished over the years.<br /><br />The film tells of small-town lawyer Paul Biegler who takes on the case of defending an army lieutenant who is accused of murdering a man he believes attacked his wife.  As Paul gets to know the victim, Laura Manion, he realizes that she may not be being entirely truthful; but his attraction to her and his desire to win the case cloud his better judgment.<br /><br />Let's talk a little bit about Lee Remick.  I just kind of laid into her acting a bit on my review for `Days of Wine and Roses', where I found her to be awkward and unconvincing.  I had seen this movie first and so I was really anticipating her performance alongside Lemmon.  The fact is, I thought she was marvelous here.  She really nails her character.  Some have balked at her being unbelievable as a victim, but that is entirely the point.  We are supposed to second guess her motives, and right from the very beginning she appears to be a young girl who screwed up and is trying to act her way out of her mistake.  She captures the ambiguity rather well, playing to her strengths by trying to seduce others into believing her.<br /><br />James Stewart is very good here, but he is outshone by Remick and a very seedy George C. Scott (can you say one of the best supporting actors of the late 50's, early 60's).<br /><br />`Anatomy of a Murder' is a very rewarding cinematic experience, rich with character development (I love the way Stewart is able to create a complete internal change within Paul) and realistic story progression.  The end result is something very entertaining.  I have to say this, it is not as brilliant as some have laid claim to, nor is it something truly groundbreaking; but it is very, very good.  The acting is all spot on and the ending in particular is appropriate and adds a nice layer of intrigue as our perceptions of the truth are either confirmed or completely turned on their heads.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of these courtroom type films, but this one sold me, so major props for that.  It also made me really want to read the novel by John D. Voelker.  I'd recommend this without any hesitation.sult is something very entertaining.

031606792X|2.0|This had to be the lamest book I've ever read. For real. Its really sad because it could have been a good book, a great book, but Meyer screwed this up big time.<br /><br />How in the world can a vampire impregnate anything?? And the whole pregancy ordeal was a trainwreck and sickening. How Bella was turned only when she was about to die from childbirth, and not with the customary vampire bite, but with a damn syringe? Jacob imprints on a infant, her half breed baby? And then after she becomes a vampire, she stops being interesting. I mean seriously she's downright boring, except for an occasional snarl and growl here and there. All the saucy quips, the attitude, and dry humor, that made Bella interesting, its gone.<br /><br />Im wondering if Meyer got bored, said F**k it, I'll write anything to get this book over with.

0810970686|5.0|My 8 year old son, who is in 3rd grade, has had trouble reading and comprehending at his level and above.  Getting him to read a long book without pictures has been nearly impossible.  One day he came home with \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" book and he was done before I knew it!  He could not put the book down!  He read the first 2 books he borrowed from school and could not get his hands on the 3rd one...I turned to Amazon and found a great deal on the hard cover book and purchased it for him...He was so surprised and happy and finished the book...He can't wait for the next one!  I would highly recommend this series of books to any child who is having trouble in reading and comprehending.  This is a great way to get your non readers reading and LOVE IT!
B001VPJYZK|2.0|after an awesome 4th season and almost past midseason on the 5th season, its really sad to say this show should be put to rest for good,the storylines are absurd,no real funny moments,all the ladys are simply boring,even eva longoria who is by far the funniest. i really think they should end this series in the sixth season and bring back fan favorites like susan daughter and bree's daughter. i heard they wanna prolong this until 2013,and i dont even want to imagine what kinda show would that be by then,expecially after losing edie and a mistery thats so beyond stupid and predictable it hurts. anyway we'll see

The CD is just now going to SIT in my computer's CD tray.    This Encryption technology is defeating the music industry's effort to expand buyers trust especially when Apple's ITunes has done away with DRM and the RIAA is able to TRACK file-swappers. IF I BUY CDS, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIP THEM AT 320 KBPS, which is why I BUY CDs instead of  downloading albums, AND NOT HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE CD WHEN I WANT TO HEAR IT AT THE 320 KBPS QUALITY.    I would give this music by Madonna 5 Stars, but the Encryption technology only allows me to give it 1 Star = Ray of Light gets 3 Stars.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|A five-star movie, that's all.  What else can be said.  I didnt know the whole story when i saw it, and i was glad.  I loved it... the music, the way it was made... it's a \\"story,\\" not all movies are meant to be true-to-life... HELLO people??!  It's fantastic... end of story!
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I saw this with a friend and got nothing out of this. It starts with someone being tortured, and he has these flashbacks about his life. It was a dull stupid life. The torture made no sense, and at the end, it was like, what happened? I couldn't relate to the people, didn't feel anything for them. The only part that touched me at all, was fearing that boy would drop that baby if the little girl wouldn't take her.  other than what, it was a waste of time.  If you like these sort of odd love stories, flashbacks and whatever else, it may be good. But in all honestly, it was boring.  I know, giving a \\"bad\\" review will have people swarm in, and say something to insult me or my review, go right ahead. Just know one thing, we have different taste. This may be a great movie for certain types of people. Just because I don't like it, doesn't mean it's a horrible film. I just think it could have been done a lot lot better.
B000VE439Y|4.0|One of Monty Python's best films. Poor Brian doesn't want to be a savior but his followers won't leave him alone, and his own mother won't give him any respect. Lots of laughs throughout. I know some who don't like it because of their deep religious beliefs, but I don't see any conflict. In my opinion it's just a funny film that takes satirical jabs at blind worship of any kind; religious, celebrity, or whatever
B001C3KCSY|5.0|This is a great CD! Every single song is good and it's easy listening if you are in the car quite a bit. I would highly recommend this album.
B001CD6FKI|3.0|This movie had a whole lot of great elements from the old cartoon! It had great actors playing great characters! Every actor was more-or-less spot on! It had a great, almost cel shaded bubble gum style and look to it! It even had a great story! So, you ask, where did it fail? Car-fu. Well, the Wachowski brothers seem to have forgotten this is a story about racing and turned the whole thing into a story about aggressive \\"car-fu\\" driving. Now I, for one, feel NASCAR is boring but grand-prix and rally is not. Did they feel they couldn't make racing interesting? Hell, Talledega Nights almost made me feel NASCAR was exciting, imagine if these two (usually) talented directors had actually put effort into interesting and exciting race sequences! Alas, it was not to be and for me the lack of racing dropped this otherwise excellent movie a whole star and a half. It is worth a watch if your a fan of the old show, just know what your getting into. I'd like the Wachowski's to pull a Lucas and re-work the movie by redoing the car-fu as actual car races, but I'd better not hold my breath.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|Nearly a decade back, I sat, not a yard away from Diana Krall at Blues Alley, a club in in DC that holds maybe 40 people. The thin shy blonde from Canada  played a mean piano and did some great versions of Nat King Cole songs. Playing a lot (and singing occationally) with her backup trio. She was just great.<br /><br />It seems like her new albums get slicker and slicker until she is nearly drowning in a sea of strings. She has, or had real talent! She appears with less and less clothing on her newer albums and more and more violins. Not that I have anything against women in sexy clothes, but I wish there were more substance. This album is compared elsewhere to \\"Getz/Gilberto\\", a wonderful album with real substance - the second best selling Jazz album of all time. And Stan Getz, the best sax man of all time! That, \\"Quiet Nights\\" is not.<br /><br />Composer Antonio Carlos (Tom) Jobim himself, who was initially considered the greatest melody man to hit the music biz since Gershwin, actually liked the 1001 strings approach with Claus Ogerman, (like Wave) despite the fact that the small ensemble Getz arrangement outsold every other album he ever did 100 fold.<br /><br />Diana sings well, smooth, sexy for background music. Like Sinatra, she changes the title of \\"Corcovado\\" to \\"Quiet Nights\\" and the Jobim lyrics from the Rio mountain to \\"mountains and the sea, oh how lovely\\" for those Americans who don't know what Corcovado is. \\"Este Sue Olhar\\" is much nicer rendered by her in the original Portuguese. Bossa nova/Samba is always better in the melifluous Portuguese. I have always been fond of the Jobim lyric in \\"So Nice\\" \\"finding someone who could Samba thru life with me\\". ah yes.<br /><br />Her renditions are uniformly pleasant, I like the title track, and the \\"Boy from Ipanema\\" is a clever twist. The other mostly sixties music on here gets the same Bossa Nova approach, soothing for stressful times. The album isn't as bad as I make it sound, it's romantic, there is just little to get your teeth into. Too much uniformity of tempo, I think.<br /><br />I recommend the reader listen to her older albums! or \\"Getz/Gilberto\\".Too much uniformity of tempo, I think.

1438242816|2.0|First, let me be clear: I love the story behind Pride and Prejudice. Yes, it has a simple \\"nothing much happens\\" plot, but so do some of the best stories ever written. The storyline of P&P gets 5 stars from me.<br /><br />But the book...while I love and deeply appreciate Austen's vivid imagination and deep understanding of human nature, her writing style is just plain boring. I think of it as Dickens-esque, back in the day when writers were paid by the word. Descriptive detail in a book, when properly used, enhances the story. And details that give background information can generate major interest and hold a reader's attention, again, if done properly.  But dry descriptions, needlessly strewn in and testing the limits of patience, detract from the plot and feel of the book. No doubt in the early 19th century, when this book was written, people were fascinated by every last little word on the page -- after all, their lives were filled with the same tedium that fills the book.<br /><br />The adulation for this book reminds me of a sycophantic love-fest. It is \\"known\\" that this book is a paragon of English lit, and if you disagree with that opinion, you just don't \\"get\\" quality literature, or you aren't sophisticated/educated enough to appreciate it. Well, I definitely \\"get\\" it, and I'm not afraid to say that it was dull, and say furthermore that the book could have been cut in half and suffered no major losses.<br /><br />P&P stands out for me, because it is the almost the only instance where I prefer the movie ('95 mini-series, anyway) version to the book. That never happens for me, normally the book is indescribably more satisfying than the screen, but this book is the notable exception. The mini-series distills down the storyline (which, again, I think is one of the best in English literature) to its heart, and whittles away everything that is superfluous until all that is left is one of the greatest love stories of all time. Sadly, the book falls short of imparting that level of satisfaction.

0307269981|5.0|Psychology uses the words symptoms, defenses or resistance to describe the kooky things we all do. Too often what gets overlooked is how kooky things make sense. So a woman who has the caretaker role in a family becomes depressed and distant because she is drowning in other people's needs and has lost track of herself. A man flirts with someone at work because he is in a nonsexual marriage (10 times or less a year is considered nonsexual). A salesman begins to have panic attacks because a new manager has assigned unrealistic quotas. A pre-teen is struck by stammering every time the boy she secretly likes is nearby. Someone begins to drink too much because they feel invisible in their marriage.<br /><br />There is a trilogy of  Swedish crime novels by Steig Larsson that really captures this theme in the central character of Lisbeth Salander. His international bestseller The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo gives hints that Salander is untrusting, hypervigilant and a hermit because of childhood trauma. It is easy for others to misjudge her as simply weird, her psychiatric records label her as mentally challenged while we know without a shadow of a doubt that she is brilliant with a fierce moral courage. His second book The Girl Who Played With Fire (not available in the U.S. until July 28) adds many more layers to her character by revealing her past trauma which has defined her strengths. So often we are quick to judge and think we know who people are.<br /><br />In my office there is the opportunity for people to be fearlessly honest about their pain and take ownership of their strengths, to acknowledge mistakes and what was learned and to face choices with greater self-awareness. Where else in the culture at large is there a place to explore terrible things? Everything Salander does makes sense. When a beautiful young girl becomes obese it makes sense whether we understand it or not. When an adolescent is ANGRY, ANGRY, ANGRY it makes sense. When a cancer patient wants to flaunt their  baldness to remind all those non-sick people it could happen to you it makes sense. When a kid at school becomes a bully something bad is happening to them and they want to make somebody else feel as bad as they do. We all make sense even when we're kooky. We don't learn how to make pain and disappointment bearable in school, so we reach our own survival conclusions. Whether you nibble on your fingers or toes have enough respect to consider it may be a way to comfort yourself. You can't change until you honor how kooky things work in your favor.<br /><br />Read about Salander in Steig Larsson's thrilling novels. Larsson was a heavy smoker who died at 50 of a heart attack just after he completed the three novels. He has created a remarkable character who will stay in your memory for years to come. In understanding Salander the extreme introvert it is possible to gain greater understanding of yourself.

0553381687|1.0|People seriously compare this series to Tolkien? I am quite disappointed after having read the first 400 pages. The writing is well composed but the content is just not there. C'mon Tolkien created songs, histories,  races, their languages, their gods! How can people actually make the comparison? And by the way Ive seen slight mention of any magic or dragons. This book shouldn't be classified as sci-fi/fantasy. Granted Ive only read 400 pages, but Ive seen 2 magic items and no real description of what they are, what their functions are or their history. And I haven't seen one magic user nor one spell cast. Lets be serious here, what sci-fi/fantasy book doesn't cast a spell in 400 pages? Take out the few pages of barely mentioned magic and dragons and this book is a fictional account of feudal war, certainly not what I expected from the positive comments and Tolkien references I read here before buying this book. I'll continue the book at another time but I'm putting it down for now.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|The film deals with the extremely difficult problem of dealing with how to translate an entire story based on smell onto the screen. I don't want to reveal too much about this, but they were definitely successful! The ending of this movie is absolutely incredible!
0525950079|2.0|This novel moved along in a predictable, highly manipulative manner for many more pages than necessary.  It uses the late middle ages in a somewhat informed way as setting, though major fictional liberties are taken. It is anything but noteworthy literature, at times it seems more fiction sold by-the-pound, literally in Mr. Follett's case. I stuck with it--don't know why, perhaps to see what Edward II conspiracy theory the author might run with.  This is the sort of market-driven book where eventually there will be commercials every 200 pages or so.  I can't recommend this book for serious readers.
B000002GKT|5.0|It was almost 40 years ago and this album still stands.  1971 was a magical year for so much good music.  I must admit, I became a Pie fan when I bought Thunderbox (OK, maybe it WAS for the cover,) but ever since I am coninually amazed by these guys energy and ability.  Sad that Frampton was only there for a couple of years but Marriot is a gem not only as a songwriter but his unique voice and guitar slinging carry the day.  This is a MUST for any hard rock or music historian for that matter. This live album really captures the energy of the group and the 9 minute I Dont Need No Doctor makes my skin crawl.  Marriot once said he would never play Itchycoo Park live (he was with small faces you know), and to my knowlege he never did.  Never mind Steve, you became a MONSTER with this amazing performance that night.  Thanks for the memories.

B0015AARJI|3.0|Who doesn't love the haydays of PSX and PS2 domination? The dualshock controller design was great back in those days. It brought about dualstick design, all the button locations made logical sense and it worked for every type of genre out there. When the xbox came out, I like the triggers function but it was too bulky and the black/white button locations were awkward to reach.<br /><br />Since then, MS really improved their design to where 360 controller have since passed PS controller in terms of user friendliness. Last generation, a converter existed to use PS2 controller in xbox because that's what people prefer. This generation, it's the opposite, there's a converter to use 360 controller on the PS3. There's no arguing that MS improved their controller design by copying features from the dualshock controller (e.g. multiple shoulder buttons), but they also retained what was good about the original controller (analog triggers and size of xbox S controller).<br /><br />The 360 controller is superior for several reasons:<br />-Dual sticks on 360 controller are shorter than those on PS3 controllers, allowing for more precise control<br />-Resistance from the triggers on the 360 controller are linear. Triggers on the PS3 controllers resistance increase the more it's pushed in<br />-Triggers on the PS3 controllers curve in, on which fingers can easily slip off of. 360 controller triggers curve out, like triggers on firearms<br />-The 360 controller turn itself off after couple minutes of inactivity to conserve battery. The PS3 controller doesn't, often draining the battery dry
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This album is absolutely wonderful. Its been a long time since i heard an album that I liked from track one to thirteen, among this best are 'London Beckons Songs About Written by Machines' and 'I Write Sins Not Tradgies' also 'Build God, Then We'll Talk' and among some of the other longer track titled songs. Even single track hits the mark, and displays not only how wonderfull musicians Panic! is but how gifted a lyrist Ryan Ross is.

I've always liked Paul's artier and more experimental side, and feel like he's just been holding that back because he thinks the public wants to \\"play it safe.\\" I would say by the overwhelming response to The Fireman... we're ready for some more of this kind of fun.<br /><br />With Chaos, Memory Almost Full, Paul's classical piece Ecce Cor Meum (and don't forget the Beatles' Love) the 00's are shaping up to be a brilliant time to be a McCartney fan!
B001PPGAIA|4.0|I liked it. It was interesting and had it all, including Hugh Jackman. Good guys, bad guys, romance, happy, sad. It was long so watch on a rainy day.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I was sold a defective copy of this video and I beleive the buyer knew this.  I returned it right away, which cost me $10.00 UPS fee to send it(so I had proof he received it).  I was told I would be refunded and I don't know yet. if the money was put back on my credit card.  If I was going to be refunded by check, I have yet to receive the money that I paid for this dvd. I reordered the dvd from someone else and that copy was great. the second copy I ordered would rate 5 stars.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I really enjoy this film.    Michelle Pfeiffer makes a great witch and Claire Danes is probably in her best role. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Robert DeNiro has a fun role as well.    Additionally, the soundtrack is quite enjoyable.    After a long day at work, this movie is a splendid escape.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|I was impressed that the DVD came fairly quick, however the packaging was a bit beat up. I know that sometimes the condition of the package is not the seller's fault, however, I felt the packaging could have been better to prevent damage. The DVDs were fine, just not the box.
0312965788|5.0|How can anyone possibly not love the series of books about the English country vet \\"James Herriot\\"?<br />What wonderful stories! Not only well-written, but filled with humor, understanding, and at times total pathos. Books to laugh and cry with--what could be better?<br /><br />In the late '70s, I discovered them in a Heathrow bookstall--something to read on a long flight to West Africa. I was instantly enchanted! I've read them aloud to my children and find that, now as adults, they often re-read them. As do I.
0385751893|5.0|All the criticisms are true, and that indeed is why the book works.<br /><br />The holocaust as a backdrop to this story is almost inconsequential.  It could have just as easily been set in Rwanda, Sudan or the Balkans.  Younger children might in fact miss some of the simple ironies within the book, but then the tale loses none of it's richness for their absence.<br /><br />Bruno, the 9 year old protagonist, indeed seems to come off as too naive and innocent but then, what 9 year old in the midst of a historical setting which does not benefit from our current hindsight would be fully aware of all that was taking place in \\"Out With\\" based on a observations through a fence?  Would that we were all so naive.<br /><br />The identity of the two main characters through the simple device of a shared birthday brings home the empathy they evoke to which the reader is invited to enter.<br /><br />The violence is far from gratuitous and yet more real for being left to the imagination of the reader.<br /><br />This is a book however that parents should engage together with children under Jr High Level in my opinion.  The ending for sensitive readers requires some maturity and ability to differentiate between fable and reality that many young readers may lack without guidance.<br /><br />The Holocaust itself is dying in the remembrance of our collective consciousness, but as the book itself asks at the end, such a thing could never happen again in our day and age, could it?<br /><br />Look around ... look around.<br /><br />5 stars<br /><br />Bart Breen
B000001EUR|4.0|The Scorpions are a very good group. While all of their songs here are good, \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" stands out as their best, here. The other songs are good, too. Recommended if you like 80's heavy metal.
0553378384|5.0|There are some strange ideas on the Nodes floating about out there in the cyber-world, but Jan's theories are well founded in the fundamental principals of Western astrology. Her understanding of the Nodes is excellent, however, some of the more fundamentalist Vedic Indian ideas are so claustophobic and disempowering, that they engender fear in fate and destiny. Be careful of these other literalist positions that deny your free will and pigeon-hole your fate.<br />  As the author of a new book on the Nodes--\\"North Node Astrology; Rediscovering Your Life Direction and Soul Purpose\\" I give Jan a lot of credit for her work here. The rest of us stand on her shoulders and take what knowledge and wisdom we have picked up along the way, and add to what she has done. It's a growing exciting field, but let's stay on track with a wholesome understanding of the Nodes as an expression of compassion--and as holding the secret of the soul's journey. ~elizabeth spring

0316067601|5.0|Do not listen to 1-star reviews of this book by those taking on elitist attitudes towards the lack of flowery adjectives and fluff.  It's more likely the writer's politics that bother them, so they assume the stance of literature snobs.  #1 - It's written the way it is because it's the recounting of a tale, a war story.  Imagine sitting down with a beer, a crackling fireplace and a friend who has a very fascinating story to tell.  He starts recounting his tale, backtracking as he needs to fill in the holes, and before you know it, hours and hours have gone by and you are spellbound.  Luttrell wrote things the way he would think and say them, sometimes it's even humorous, but more often than not, it is harrowing.  Luttrell did NOT write things the way a stoned poet would.  We do not think in similes and metaphors and neither does he.  Luttrell let his wit and personality shine through.  By the end of this book, you will feel as if you personally know him.    #2 - \\"He's too political and anti-liberal\\"....In the first part of the book, Luttrell rants a little against the liberal media.  At this point, some people closed the book and missed out on one hell of a great story.  When you read further and \\"open your mind\\" (isn't that a favorite phrase of liberals?), it becomes very clear how Luttrell formed his opinions and solidified them on the battlefield.  I can't understand how someone can read the book all the way through and then not see WHY he feels the way he does.  Did they not read the heart-wrenching scenes where he watched his friends die?  Did they not read about the numerous hells he faced? If any of us were in his situation and suffered the after-effects, we would also be centered on that ONE decision that could have changed everything.  Luttrell is entitled to his opinions and he's more than earned the right to speak them.  Too often we hear the opinions of those who have never been the very places they have such heated opinions about.  Yet, when someone whohas speaks honestly...he should be silenced?  Honestly, who is more qualified to give their opinion?  Marcus Luttrell?  Or some group of rich idiots with guitars that somehow think this gives them political omniscience?     #3 - \\"Too self-aggrandizing, too much testosterone\\"...Okay guys, it's bad when this reviewer is a mother and seems to have no problem with \\"testosterone\\" in this book.  Would it be better if Luttrell had added some scenes where he and the Taliban throw down their weapons and perform a ballet number in an opium field?  I don't think some of these reviewers have personally known military or they are military (so say a few reviewers) and are just jealous because Luttrell's experiences are not typical.  Most military personnel are not put in the position to be called heroes by their brethren.  One thing most service members share is pride.  Why?  Because pride is what gives you a purpose for living when things get tough.  Pride of service and loyalty is not arrogance.  It's a survival tactic that forms the bonds of military brotherhood.  If some had no pride in their liberal views, some wouldn't be writing bad reviews on an otherwise great book.  Everyone possesses it and the man who says he doesn't is lying.  Do you think Marcus Luttrell wakes up every day, looks in the mirror, and tells himself how awesome he is?  I highly doubt it.  Anyone who knows someone who has had to endure a fraction of what these men have to endure can tell you that.  I've watched the despair of someone close to me because his friend died in Iraq and he's still living.  Texas, the United States, his SEAL training...Luttrell is proud of them.  Does that make him arrogant?  No.  His pride helps keep him sane after all that's happened...and that battle goes on long after the battlefield is left behind.      This book is not a dry, journalistic military recounting of events.  It's full of heart and vigor.  It's a military memoir whose heart lives on after the last page.  The writing is raw and the overwhelming popularity of this book is because the events that transpire are told so realistically you will feel like they are happening to you.  At times it's painful to read, at times you will laugh out loud, at times you will get angry, and you will cry no matter how tough you think you are, but when it's all said and done,  you will feel like you just lived through these events alongside Luttrell.  One of the last great American novels for true patriots.
B000W91RUG|4.0|I really love the show and I would grade it a 5, no doubt.     But it's the DVD I'm grading...    I've watched the DVDs with the French subtitles and the translation's quite poor. It seems to get better after a while though. I'm aware it's not an easy job to translate all the jokes and puns, but still, I think that I'd have done a better job. I was hoping that the subtitles would help me get a few things I had missed, but I ended up being annoyed by the poor translation.    I cannot say for the other languages.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I bought these to replace another Plantronics set that I broke. They sound decent (if a little tinny), and the microphone does what it needs to do.     The microphone doesn't immediately stick out in front of your mouth, but you can bend it into shape as long as you don't care about sliding it back into the headphone band. I don't care to hide the mircophone, anyway. This set already has the \\"military chopper pilot\\" look, so you may as well complete it with the microphone.    These headphones leak a bit more than the last set I used, so they're not useful for quiet listening when someone else is in the room. If you're trying to game at night without waking up the house, then they'll do. Overall it's a decent heaphone set for the price.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Last week I realized that Leonard Cohen is going to perform in Philadelphia next month. I am not living there, but it would be in a distance one could realistically travel to. So I went to a fansite and searched around for more info, eventually I found links to ticket sellers and online dealers etc.<br /><br />Ha! Prices between 129 $ and 249 $ per ticket?!<br />Who could afford that?<br />Well, maybe people from New York or California, but avarage middle-class people from a low-income state with an average income certainly cannot. So what now?<br /><br />I got this DVD instead.<br /><br />And it is great.<br /><br />And guess what, it was on sale for 16.99$.<br />A concert of two and a half hours length!<br /><br />I watched it yesterday and I must say, this is really a great deal, definately worth more than it costs. I am fascinated by this graceful old man, this wise poet, who is so humble and modest on the stage, and so great.<br /><br />He keeps introducing the band by their names, which I liked a lot. This reminds you that the show is a team effort, not just one guy with some anonymous dudes in the back. No, the three singers and and the musicians are really very good, and they absolutely deserve to be announced by their names!<br /><br />This reminded me of a singer I once knew. She always makes a point that she (and nobody else, just she, and she alone!) is the leadsinger of a certain group. She performs with 2 background singers, and they used to start every concert with a song that featured all three of them individually in a separate solo verse. One of the backing singers regularly got bigger applause for her solo than Madame.<br />What do you think happened? Yes, right, that song was changed, and no solo verses have been sung ever again but by herself. That was in 1991 or so, and they still start with the same song, but never again with solo verses in any song. Nobody can get more applause than Madame herself! So there!<br /><br />When I watched this Cohen concert yesterday, I was impressed how gracefully and generously this man pointed out the huge talents of his musicians. Not once but like eleven times during the 125 minutes of the concert! Yes, he can share the light, and he clearly was not jealous that also the musicians and the singers received applause they deserved.<br /><br />I am still in awe of this poet.<br /><br />If you can afford to see him in concert, absolutely go for it!<br /><br />If you are like me, middle-class in a low-income state, and 2 concert tickets would cost the monetary equivalent of 5-8 days of work - then get this DVD!<br /><br />Really!<br />I mean it!<br /><br />Even in case it is no longer on sale when you read this.<br />Buy this and be happy and enjoy a wonderful concert.this man pointed out the huge talents of his musicians.

B00000612P|5.0|I have spent some time in this space going over the litany of rock & roll groups and individuals who collectively formed the musical consciousness of my generation, the \\"Generation of `68\\". The Rolling Stones, The Doors and the Beatles immediately come to mind. The performer under review, Rod Stewart, now known more for his fine (mostly) crooner covers of old time pre-rock songs fits into the second layer of those who entertained us and made us scream for more rock & roll. And, someone can add to this to refresh my memory, Rod Stewart was one of the early proponents of the rock concert as entertainment extravaganza in the old English music hall tradition. I can remember going to a Rod Stewart concert in the old days where he had circus acts, complete with fireworks and colored smoke in between his performances (and maybe as part of the performance as well). Such visual effects are practically de rigueur these days but then it was unusual.    Be that as it may the main thing about a Rod Stewart song in the old days as reflected in this CD  is that energy he put into each song his own as here with \\"Maggie May\\" and \\"Every Picture Tells A Story\\", or covers. In the end though, for me at least for male singers it is that gravelly voice that he brought to the performance highlighted here by \\"Mandolin Wind\\".

I mean, would Regis Philbin or Meredith Vieira try to cheat a contestant?  Would the producers want a ratings sensation to lose?<br /><br />Is it okay to celebrate a movie that entertains the privileged with a rose-colored view of poverty and overpopulation?<br /><br />Good, however, is a City of God/Bollywood/fairytale film made for the poor of India.  Only problem is this film just exploits them by water coloring over the squalor of their wretched lives.  And, incidentally, by the way things are going, there is an enormous mountain of poverty to come worldwide, degrading much of humanity.<br /><br />(But, hey, I just got the DVD to be entertained.  I don't need to hear about the troubles of the world.)

B001PA0FFO|5.0|Doubt deserved more awards and nominations that it received.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire way through. This taut drama couldn't have been edited any better--there's nothing much to cut here! The plot moves along at a very good pace and the acting is very convincing; the brilliant cast turns in tremendous performances that would make most \\"celebrities\\" green with envy. The cinematography worked well, especially in the scenes in Sister Aloysius' office; and the choreography shines all the way through the film.<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II), the first and only African-American student in The Saint Nicholas Catholic School in late 1964. Donald doesn't fit in; the rest of the students are from Italian and Irish families and he does get harassed by a fellow student soon after he enters the school. Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) takes a liking to the young boy and professes that he wants to help Donald because Donald comes from a troubled home. Father Flynn thinks Donald needs extra attention to be sure Donald succeeds in his new school. Trouble is, however, that one day Sister James (Amy Adams) witnesses some odd behavior: Father Flynn returns Donald's undershirt to his locker instead of just giving it directly to Donald; and after a private talk with Father Flynn Donald returns to class--with alcohol on his breath.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius already dislikes Father Flynn intensely; his progressive attitudes represent all that is changing in the outside world while Sister Aloysius is desperate to preserve the old ways of life. Sister Aloysius also dislikes that Flynn takes sugar in his tea, wears his fingernails a bit long--and now he wants a secular song added to the school's annual Christmas show. But once Sister Aloysius finds out that Donald may have been approached by Father Flynn in an inappropriate way, she just might have all that she needs to drive him out.<br /><br />And what a power struggle it becomes. Sister Aloysius gets nothing but denial from Father Flynn; he adds that Mr. McGuinn (Jack O'Connell) caught Donald drinking alter wine and that Father Flynn privately forgave him so that Donald could remain an alter boy. Does McGuinn back this up? And when Sister Aloysius tries to talk to Donald's mother (Viola Davis) about the potential problem, she gets quite a different reaction than she expected. What an explosive scene!<br /><br />I can't say enough about these incredible, unforgettable performances. These actors really and truly become the characters that they play in this film; everything is THAT convincing. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Viola Davis worked magic to make these characters come to life. The final confrontation between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn couldn't have been performed any better. In addition, the theme of light is very noticeable; Sister Aloysius opens the shutters to put Father Flynn in a police-like interrogation spotlight when she initially questions him with Sister James at her side; and it's interesting to note that Sister James, who comes to believe that Father Flynn is innocent, \\"causes\\" a light bulb to go out during a conversation she has with Sister Aloysius. The wind also is used to highlight the tensions between all these people.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a number of very good extras. We get a featurette on the Sisters Of Charity; and there's a commentary with writer/director John Patrick Stanley. I also liked the bonus feature entitled Doubt: From Stage To Screen. There is more, too.<br /><br />Doubt is not a family movie; it's a dark, pensive film that packs a punch. It also makes a strong statement about the difficulty of interpreting behavior that is ambiguous to say the least.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth is a very amazing documentary. I learned a lot of new things about the natural world that I would have never imagined. If I had not seen this series I would have never known of the Amurian Leopard which is almost extinct. It also made me think about how threatened the natural world is. I would add a lot more but since all previous reviews already stated the many good things about these series I can just recommend it to everyone.

As a spectator and sometimes participant in earthly activities, she is able to maintain connected to the living in ways that most people on earth fail to notice.<br /><br />Overall, a good book but not a great book and not the earth-shaking masterpiece that some would have you believe.<br /><br />I am stingy with the stars as I found the thought of Susie not just hanging around watching her family for a couple of weeks  but she followed them around for years as a spirit watching.  I found that thought disturbing.  I would have given it a 2 star  but I will give it a 3 star as I shouldn't penalise the author because I found the spirit idea disturbing. The first 1/3 of the story much better than the rest of it.
0451169514|3.0|Maybe I'm expecting too much from Mr. King. Maybe I'm missing the point. I understand that he is a MASTER story teller. I appreciate how three dimensional his characters are, and I enjoyed the realistic dialogue. Some of the background stories were interesting, and some of them were pointless.     The book was well written, but the constant time-warping was BEYOND tedious, especially in the last 200 pages. Overall, this was a decent book, but I preferred some of his earlier works to this for several reasons.
031606792X|2.0|To be blunt, Breaking Dawn was, well, lame.  I believe the Meyer should have spent more time on it rather than rushing to get the book out while she had the spotlight.  The book itself is somewhat good, but compared to the previous books, it's quite horrible. It lacked plot, focusing in too much on certain things.  The end was especially disappointing, but of course, a must-read if one has read the preceding books.
B000244FDW|4.0|So many people have provided exzcellent, detailed reviews that I wanted to add only two points.  The first is that the editing of the BBC serialization for VHS/DVD seemed a bit haphazard and omitted many scenes that made conversations and transitions smooth.  If I remember correctly, there were six episodes, and the home version is significantly shorter.  The second is that each version of Elizabeth portrays her with less of the amused detachment that characterized her in the book, and with more ill temper.  I believe that, in the book, Darcy was not a central figure in Elizabeth's life until Wickham began to weave his web of lies about him.  Had Elizabeth not been interested in Wickham, Darcy would have been a very minor player in her life.  After all, she had been apprised from the beginning that he had no interest in her, and he was socially so much her superior (despite her being a gentleman's daughter)that she could have had no expectations from that quarter.  Darcy was merely a source of great amusement to Elizabeth until she was deceived into thinking him Wickham's malefactor.  The A & E version created a chronically cranky Elizabeth, and, in the latest version with Keira Knightly, I don't think she spent five minutes of screen time in a happy frame of mind.  These are the modern interpretations of how Elizabeth would behave if she were a contemporary of the viewer, not as she would have been in Jane Austen's time.  A sprightly, lighthearted, but witty Elizabeth gets my vote over the dour, self-involved versions.
1400032717|3.0|Mark Haddon wrote this book about an autistic child. His knowledge of autism comes from working with autistic people as a young man.<br /><br />Christopher is a fifteen-year-old, mildly autistic boy who lives with his father in Swindon, a small town about a hundred miles outside London. Christopher discovers a neighborhood dog that has been killed with a pitchfork, he decides to make like his hero, Sherlock Holmes, and conduct a murder investigation<br /><br />Christopher understands mathematics and science perfectly. He also is a boy who doesn't like to be touched and cannot decipher emotions beyond the tools his teacher has taught him, and so any task requires the huge effort of testing rules and facing his own fears<br /><br />Despite the fine portrayal of an autistic person, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is somewhat boring at parts. For example, I lost interest when Christopher is doing Mathematics for ages in his head. Whenever he doesn't want to listen to someone he does mathematics again in his head I feel these parts  been cut down by 50%. Yet when he is trying to find the train station and when he is trying to get to his train that was so well done and interesting. The reader will most likely skim through some these portions.<br /><br />This story  demonstrates how an autistic person lives and how other people interact with them.<br /><br />The reader will come  away from the book with a new understanding of the difficulties of dealing<br />with autism.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Someone in the movie calls Jamal's story \\"bizarrely plausible\\" and I would have to agree. The story is basically structured in a way that if one thing had happened differently in Jamal's life he wouldn't have be able to answer all the questions on Who Wants to Be A Millionaire. While nothing in life ever works like that I think it made a really nice story.<br /><br />Basically the movie was exactly what I thought it would be. It was good but I wouldn't call it great. I heard from tons of people how wonderful it was but also from a few friends (who have similar tastes) who said it was good but not THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME, and I would have to agree with them. While I liked the movie I think The Curious Case of Benjamin Button should have gone home with the Oscar, that movie blew me away.<br /><br />While I liked the structure of the story I did have problems with it. I liked the relationship between Jamal and Latika but felt when they met up towards the end of the movie we should have seen some more proof of their chemistry, I wasn't totally convinced. And the ending, the actual ending (with illustrated credits etc) that totally changed the mood of the movie and I thought was a bit uncalled for.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire was a good movie but not really as emotionally empactful as other movies I'v seen. A lot of people are commenting on how hard some of the scenes were to watch, I was waiting for it to rise above movies like The Kite Runner, City of God, and Tsotsi, compared to those movies Slumddog Millionaire was a cake walk to watch. Also, I was disappointed that it was mostly in English. I know I'm coming off as a total film snob, sorry. I really felt the need to nitpick this one. But don't get me wrong I did enjoy and like the movie!<br /><br />All in all, a good but not great movie with an interesting premise.
1595141715|5.0|Exceptional page-turner.  I really like how the author included events that led to Hannah's suicide.    I personally think that the impacts of events vary for everyone.  No, not all the reasons she killed herself were so big that they could cause someone to have suicidal thoughts, but keep in mind that everything happened one after another, and that could push someone over the edge.  So please, think before you type. (:
0201633612|4.0|Nobody is going to take away GoF's mantle, but is the 1995 book still the best available reference on, or introduction to, the subject? Tentative \\"yes\\" on the former, emphatic \\"no\\" on the latter. One will be better off by consulting \\"Head First Design Patterns\\", and not lose that much by stopping there.
B001LOU6ZS|4.0|i like qute a bit of ufo,s mechanix. songs like the writer,doing it all for you,back into my life,feel it and dreaming to name a few!!unfortuneatly founding member bassist  pete way left after the mechanix tour. because he did,nt like the direction ufo was heading in musically with some of the tunes of mechanix..i saw ufo on the tour for mechanix and they were great they opened for rainbow!!andy parker the drummer had this huge chrome drum set paul chapman had a white b.c. rich,pete way and neil carter had white washburn basses and guitars..ufo played almost every great song they made including electric phase which paul chapman played slide guitar on!....well this album seems to end the 80,s era...so get it!!!

0596007124|5.0|I cringe reading complaints about this book being \\"simplistic\\" or \\"insufferably cute\\". Being entertaining and simple is good! Try GoF and feel the difference - in particular, ask yourself whose examples stay in your memory. Even if the GoF book (maybe) should not be skipped altogether - for \\"Consequences\\" chapters, and a proper discussion of Bridge - definitely start with \\"Head First Design Patterns\\".
B00000IMTH|5.0|my favorite period for rainbow is the dio era i love the mystical lyrics dio wrote and sang so well and ritchie blackmores guitar soundscapes that made songs like gates of babylon,lady of the lake,long live rock,n,roll and kill the king songs that had a visual aspect as well as a great unique early version of rock and roll gothic style,black sabbath and blue oyster cult were also examples of great music wedded with gothic lyrics....if this is your bag baby...get this and all the dio era rainbow discs!!!

B001EOOQEM|5.0|i am a fan of black sabbath,s ozzy and dio eras...so in 1979 when ozzy left sabbath it just so happpened that ronnie dio had just left rainbow..after the long live rock,n,roll tour.. ronnie dio ran into tony iommi at the rainbow club in l.a. one night shortly after they jammed and it was a perfect union of dio,s dark mystical lyrics and sabbath,s awesome power that resulted in the masterpiece: heaven and hell...my favorite cuts are; neon knights,children of the sea,lady evil,heaven and hell,wishing well and lonely is the word!! the tour for this great album was awesome too black sabbath and blue oyster cult toured together!!if you are a fan of dio era sabbath grab this disc!!!!!
B000O78KW4|4.0|This is an awesome sequel with lots of action! John McClane is back doing what he doesa best on yet another very bad day. After a bomb goes off in the Bonwit Teller department store in New York City, Simon calls the NYPD and asks for John to play a game. During one of the games, a Harlem shopkeeper named Zeus Carver helps John. Throughout the day, John and Zeus go on a wild-goose chase to stop bombs going off, but it's all part of a much bigger plan. Simon happens to be Hans Grubber's brother from the original Die Hard. I highly recommend DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd offers a great workout.  I skipped w/o 1 as I am not new to exercise, and must say the following 2 make me sweat, and it only takes 20 minutes.  Great for someone with time issues.  The only thing I don't like is there is no fast forwarding through the intro which is a pain so I try to start the dvd while I am getting in my workout clothes that way I don't have to listen to the commercial for the Biggest Loser DVD's and Jillian's speech.    I do recommend this DVD - you will need hand weights.
0375842209|5.0|I'd heard a lot of great things about this book so I had to read it for myself.  It definitely lived up to the hype.  It was a beautiful story filled with heart and soul.  I loved the characters and the writing.  And there was something magical about the storytelling.  I would enthusiastically recommend this to kids and adults alike.  It's so good, I'm re-reading it so I can enjoy it a second time.
B001EOOQF6|4.0|this record is the second helping of sabbath with dio..by the time this record was being recorded founding member drummer bill ward left and vinny appice joined sabbath...anyway mob rules contains some great stuff such as:turn up the night,sign of the southern cross,voodoo,mob rules,e5150..and falling of the edge of the world..all in all this a strong album get it play it loud!!!
B001FB55N0|4.0|Disney was right to support this Adam Sandler comedy. It will have a good laugh for the whole family. Sandler plays Skeeter Johnson, a hotel worker that has been cleaning up everyone's messes for twenty-five years. His father had once owned a motel at the same location but it was bought out by another man when they told Skeeter's father they would make Skeeter manager if he worked hard and showed initiative. They then built a big hotel around it. Skeeter has finally come to the conculusion he will never get his shot as promised. The next thing he knows his sister is begging him to watch her kids with another friend of hers while she goes out of town for an interview.<br /><br />All of a sudden he has to babysit his sisters two kids. He hasn't seen his sister in years and considering her unusual vegetarian diet and exaggerated attitude about saving the planet, we wonder why in the world would she choose Skeeter to babysit. His idea of diet includes junkfood and he can't stomach all the save this and that books. So he decides to make up his own story. It turns out Skeeter has a talent for telling bedtime stories like his father before him. The results of the stories on real life is where it really gets interesting. Part of his stories appears to have affected his real life. Or at least how he believes they are is what changes his life. Fun family movie. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability.

079073463X|4.0|Ladyhawke, a classic and one of my all time favorites, was quite a disappointment after seeing it again recently. A young thief escapes from the dungeons of a city only to be saved from the clutches of the city guard by a mysterious warrior accompanied by a hawk. At night, however, he finds himself in the company of a beautiful lady and a mysterious wolf... The story, coincidently, unfolds in Aquila (where the earthquake recently struck) during the Middle Ages.   In short, this is not the movie I remember from my childhood. Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeifer, and Matthew Broderick brought back memories, though it might have been better to avoid viewing the film again and instead holding on to those cherished childhood memories.   The music is simply awful, the acting is horrid, and the dialogues are terrible (a B-movie by all standards), though the story is very good and it makes up, to a certain extent, for the film's setbacks. 3.5 Stars

B001FB55M6|4.0|Everyone loses their way at some point. In the case of Carl, played by Jim Carrey, his loss of his girlfriend has him in a rut. He lacks initiative to see new things at work and at home so he says no to everything. His friends become really upset when he bows out on a friends rehearsal party. But have no fear, another friend who has gone native instructs him to go to a Yes! seminar. Carl does it, and it changes his life. Now we all know saying yes to everything may seem like we are opening up, but not every person has us in mind when they ask us for something. Some of the people that ask Carl for something truly benefits them both, but some of them put him in trouble. Seeing how he fixes things is half the fun. Be sure to catch this entertaining comedy for all, but with some parental guidance. Good quality DVD with lots of replayability.

B000002OMN|5.0|This album is one of my favorites - I listen to it every time I go for a long drive.  I consider this album better than the original and its sequel - the production is cleaner and the songs have better hooks.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I finally get it.  John is a very gifted musician and more talented than his overexposed social life might suggest.  He should stick with his enormous talet as showcased on this great dvd and back off the tabloid social exposure.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|The movie is great but I've seen it before purchasing, hehe. The extras are very good and a lot, specialy if you have BD Live. The only issue is that you have to wait a lot while it updates BD Live through the Internet.
0930289234|3.0|The plot and character development of the story is superb. So where does it go wrong? The story is too slow. While adding depth is great, there too many times where the dialogue runs on longer than needed. In addition, there are too many scenes that seemed longer than necessary. It's like one of those Hollywood epic films that badly needed to be trimmed. Aside from these flaws, you still have a good graphic novel with solid writing.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I wanted to see a good movie, but all I got was an okay movie. And \\"okay\\" seems to be a refrain through most of the reviews for this film. I haven't read the book, so I can't speak to its faithfulness or anything like that.     The bad things about the film are the plot twist at the end and the way no character has enough screen time to be fully developed (except, perhaps, for Johanssen's).     There are three good things about this film. First, the tension between the beautiful women. While Natalie Portman appears rather rigid through the film, Scarlett Johanssen is great. It's strange to see these beautiful women spar with one another, and that tension makes the film more enjoyable because it makes the audience tense.     The second good thing about the film are the beautiful sets. The film sets the Tudor mode wonderfully.    The best thing about the film is the plot's theme: the danger of ambition. It sees ambition as sin, and points out through very certain terms, that \\"the wages of sin is ...\\" And I like that about the film. Everyone who lusts for power is eventually crushed. I was expecting a simple love story, and the way this theme is so overarching brings it above a simple, mediocre love story.
B000VECAEO|4.0|The DVDs has a loooooooot of extras for EACH chapter, I've never saw something like this, a lot of extras... I didn't saw all of them, just a few and all the chapters. The Finale is not the best I'd imagine but it's very good anyway!
B001JNNE64|3.0|Like Wolfgan Amadeus sais in the movie, too many notes! How can can you re-write what's already perfect ???...the original movie is GREAT...Directors cut gives scenes that mislead the characters personalities already established....TOO MANY NOTES!!!<br />Also I am maaad with Amazone because when I bought the blu ray never says it's the directors cut which I already have and hate!<br />GET THE THEATRICAL VERSION IN BLU RAY!!!
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I purchased this movie from Amazon.com for several reasons.  This was an easy way to shop, I hate shopping in stores.  This was a great price, shipped very quickly, was new, sealed and my granddaughters loved it.  I just keep checking amazon for all products before going out of my home. Thanks!!!!
B0008ENICU|4.0|The 2008 version of this movie with the same title just doesn't hold a candle to The Women (1939). Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell are fabulous. Once you get past the scene where they're in the beauty shop and everyone is talking at the same time and volume (LOUD), it gets better. Everyone talks very fast in this movie, so you will want subtitles on in order to catch what they're saying. It is definitely an education to see how women's roles and views have changed in 70 years.

You'll even meet Super Soul, a blind, black DJ that tries to help our driver with his unique powers of esp, until he gets roughed up by some local racist cops. You'll have to get the video to see how it all unfolds. A must for any car guy.

B000002ULO|5.0|For those of you who thought Paul McCartney was fallow from Band On The Run until Memory Almost Full, and that Memory was a \\"new\\" work of art, you must have missed Flaming Pie along the way.  Actually, Flowers In The Dirt was the first remarkable \\"comeback\\" album and released in '89 was pretty much Paul and Linda's only great piece of work in the 80's.  Other albums from the late 70's through the 80's had memorable moments but as a whole the albums were rather unremarkable.  Flowers In The Dirt was helped along primarily by way of the hand Elvis Costello lent to production, invoking the spirit of John Lennon, and also with signature guitar work of David Gilmour.  In '97, Linda's health was waning (she would pass away in the spring of '98) and this would be the last album for the McCartney's as a couple.<br /><br />Paul says of Flaming Pie \\"The Beatles Anthology project reminded me of The Beatles standards and the standards that we reached with the songs.  So in a way, it was a refresher course that set the framework for the album.\\"  Now if you are asking about the title of album, just in case you do not know, in 1961 John Lennon was asked by reporters how they got the name \\"Beatles\\" and John said \\"I had a vision that a man came unto us on a flaming pie and he said `you are beatles with an A' and so we were!\\"<br /><br />Incidentally, Flaming Pie is Paul's first return to working with George Martin in Abbey Road since the 70's.  Flaming Pie is Paul and Linda working with son James McCartney, Jeff Lynne, Steve Miller, and Ringo Starr.  The album is an \\"emotional\\" one and filled with music most McCartney fans had not heard before.  Now if you hear it after Memory Almost Full, you can see where this latest work got its roots.  Maureen Starkey had recently died of cancer and Ringo and her had not only remained close but Ringo was at her bedside when she died, and Paul and Linda had remained very close friends with Maureen and Ringo's children.  Linda was slipping away.  The Anthology project had resurfaced all the Lennon love.  So Flaming Pie was an album of love and devotion chocked full of dedications and memories.  Steve Miller and Jeff Lynne were \\"Beatle\\" friends and had worked on the production side for all four Beatles at various times.  Remember, at the same time that Linda was passing away, George was as well.<br /><br />A highlight reel:<br /><br />The Song We Were Singing is a lovely tribute to and remembrance of the times John and Paul spent writing together.  Unapologetic of the bad times they had, the song wrings nothing but the love they held close between each other.  Paul and Jeff Lynne recorded and produced.<br /><br />The World Tonight is a light rocker by Paul and Jeff which evokes Wings and Beatles flourishes throughout.  Released as a single, the song is perhaps the only song that will be enjoyed by everyone who listens to this album.<br /><br />If You Wanna is Paul and Steve Miller rocking together.  Miller fills the lyrical gaps with some of his best leads since the classic Steve Miller Band era.<br /><br />Somedays is a beautiful acoustic memory performed by Paul and George Martin with wonderful orchestration.  This is perhaps Paul's last love song to Linda.<br /><br />Young Boy, Paul with Steve Miller again.  Features vocals from Steve as well as guitar work.<br /><br />Calico Skies is an acoustic piece with George Martin again.  The title and \\"feel\\" of the song come from Paul's being stranded with a guitar on Long Island when Hurricane Bob made landfall there in 1991.<br /><br />Flaming Pie is a modern minimalist McCartney work harkening back to his experimental Beatles compositions and early pre-Wings workings, yet forward looking to Memory Almost Full.  Jeff Lynne produces and assists with instruments and vocals.<br /><br />Heaven On A Sunday is a family affair, both in style and content and in production.  Paul and Linda and James McCartney with Jeff Lynne.  James plays electric solo during the breaks.<br /><br />Used To Be Bad is the result of Steve Miller urging Paul to do some Texas Blues.  Paul and Steve trade lead vocals and play all instruments.<br /><br />Souvenir, Paul and Jeff reproduce a Beatle-esque multi-track recording, complete with Lennon style effects and coda.<br /><br />Little Willow is made in memory of Maureen Starkey and is dedicated to the Starkey children.  A very loving tribute song with help from Jeff Lynne.<br /><br />Really Love You is a Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr blues rocker with electric guitar leads from Jeff.  This song is the first ever credited as a McCartney-Starkey composition.  There are shades of Rolling Stones to the song.<br /><br />A Beautiful Night is as close to a true Beatles recording as you could get in 1997.  Recorded at Abbey Road under production and engineering and orchestration by George Martin, the song features Paul and Linda and Ringo with Jeff resulting in a work worthy to sit alongside Free As A Bird and Real Love.  Ringo plays an actual replica of his own Beatles drum kit (purchased by Paul for the Anthology series).<br /><br />One of Paul's first ever compositions as a solo artist, the album closer is actually a McCartney family opener.  As they used to sit around the kitchen in the early 70's, with the kids dancing, Paul would play this little acoustic piece for the family.  Now the song \\"Great Day\\" closes Flaming Pie as the last Paul and Linda McCarney recording.<br /><br />Last Note: another reviewer on this album hinted at the fact that Paul often seemingly needs a certain amount of stress in releasing his true works of art.  Written before Memory Almost Full came out, that review now seems a little prophetic.  I'd have to agree in retrospect.  Flaming Pie released shortly before Linda's death, Run Devil Run shortly after, and Memory Almost Full after the Heather divorce debacle, all seem to meet the requirement under the theorem.  Ram was released during the height of the Lennon-McCartney wars.  The only failures to this rule are the artistic and commercial successes of Band On The Run and Flowers In The Dirt, perhaps those two can be called \\"inspired\\" out of love, eh?  These titles are the essence of any McCartney collection.  They deliver the best of a musical legend, bar none.and Steve trade lead vocals and play all instruments.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm 5'1, 115 lbs. and I burn about 511 with a 60 minute Firm workout; however, I'm not sure if I could withstand 60 minutes of a Jilian workout!    This dvd is great!  I tried Level 1 for the first time last night. A 20 minute workout made me skeptical but I thought it would be a nice supplement after running a mile or two on the busy days (which are most).  Today I feel sore in my arms, back and glutes.      Jilian is a no BS trainer as she is tough and pushes you out of your comfort zone.  I regularly do The Firm workouts, which are 45-60 minutes of whole body strength training and cardio.  The Firm usually does about 8 reps and switches to a different muscle group to allow the worked muscle to rest but Jilian does about 15 reps then switches for 15 reps of another move and repeats 15 reps of the first move.  I definitely worked hard with 5lb. weights.      For those new to working out, I would suggest using 2lb. weights or none at all because Jilian's reps are longer than normal.      The only lacking aspect was the ab workout.  I really felt like it should have been more than 3 minutes total of ab training.  Today, I don't feel any difference in my core.      Overall, Level 1 is a great 20 minute workout to get your heart pumping.  I will update  on Levels 2 & 3.
0793563836|5.0|This series is outstand for the price. I previously used the \\"Bass guitar for Dummies\\" book, but didn't bother to really finish it. Why? For one thing, it showed you how to read the bass clef but really didn't offer any practice lessons to help you learn it in a gradual pace.     This Hal Leonard book forces you to learn the bass clef and it's really easy with the lessons provided. In one month, I'm amazed at my progress. The lessons are smartly paced out to increase your skill and knowledge of staff reading. This is THE bass book method to get if you really want to learn on your own.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|I've been to the Orlando BMG show twice, and decided to take a look at what they had on video.  I bought the Complex Rock Tour on DVD and How To Be A Megastar on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The song lists are similar, but there are many differences in the two.<br /><br />The Complex Rock Tour doesn't have the vaudeville shtick the BMG is famous for, and at times the artifacting and pixalization on my 46\\" was almost unwatchable.  The 5.1 mix also doesn't come close to the Blu-Ray's uncompressed PCM.<br /><br />How To Be A Megastar Live! is more of a complete BMG show, complete with paintballs and marshmallows.  The picture is crystal clear (at least it is on Blu), and the visuals are outstanding.  The sound booms out like you were almost there.  But not quite... :-)<br /><br />The Inside The Tube documentary (and Mono) has excerpts of the comedy routines that aren't in the main video, or didn't fit into the tour itself.  It is almost worth the price of the disc itself.  It's also interesting to note that there are a couple of clips from the Orlando show, but Orlando is never given a mention.<br /><br />And so, I'm givin' it 5 stars.  I find myself playing the disc like it was a CD, just to have the music in the background.  The music is outstanding.<br /><br />But it's not like being at a live show.  Living through the toilet paper thing is just astounding... :-)

B001J64S8E|5.0|Well we all can agree that Season 8 has turned out to be a pretty solid year for Smallville with some great episodes (\\"Identity\\", \\"Bride\\", \\"Legion\\", \\"Infamous\\" to name a few!) But \\"Prey\\" is definately up there with my favorites. It's such an underrated episode! First, Clark makes his debut as the Red-Blue Blur! The sequence of Clark sueprspeeding around Metropolis saving various people, even leaping a tall building in a single bound was truly epic. It was great to see Clark so determined to save lives which is a clear indication that the Man of Steel is about to arrive soon. Then, there was John Jones aka Martain Manhunter who returns as Metropolis' newest detective. It's a great new role for John Jones and obviously inspired by his comic book counterpart. Phil Morris is just excellent throughtout as John as always, especially the speech he gives to Clark about his identity at the end. Then you have Sam Witer as Davis Bloome aka Doomsday giving a terrific performance. Sam, for the first time, made you care about Davis and feel sorry for him. It's a great contrast to how powerful and vicious Doomsday really is. Lastly, there are some unpredictable twists, which Smallville rarely does anymore. We also get some more foreshadowing of Tess' villainous group of meteor freaks aka the Injustice League (who will soon appear in \\"Injustice\\", episode 21 of this season!)  This episode was an intelligent, darker, maturer brand of Smallville...like the majority of this season has been. The storyines so far this season have been pretty amazing (Chloiac, the Red-Blue Blur and Doomsday) with only one really being lackluster (Lana...of course!) When I look back on Season 8, \\"Prey\\" will be one of the highlights for me!
B00008CLOA|5.0|First off, if you don't have an SACD player and a surround sound speaker hookup, I am not sure why you would buy this.  A lot of reviewers did not have the proper equipment to review this.    I have a Yamaha DVD-C950, with multi-channel analog outs.  Horrid player, but it's what I have.  I have a 7.1 setup, so the surround speakers are not located where a 5.1 setup would have them, which I feel I should mention.    Ok, we all know this album, or most of us.  The surround sound version is a new experience.  For one thing, I can actually hear some of the dialog I never could before as it's directed to separate speakers.  Very cool.    In general, surround sound is not as amazing as I think it could be.  Well, I think this disc shows what can be done.  It's interesting and enjoyable, and does not feel totally artificial.  Too bad SACD is pretty much a fringe format, and is probably dying.  People don't want to pay for music, they compress their music, then listen to them on a portable player with ear buds, so no wonder.    But for those who still persue some semblance of fidelity, and want to hear what surround mixes can sound like, give this a shot.  I know some PS3's can do SACD, and some universal players can too.
0131479415|4.0|I had experience estimating but I wanted a deeper and wider knowledge of the \\"black science\\" of estimation.    So that I bought both this book for specifically focus on agile and \\"Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art\\" by Steve McConnell for a wider vision of estimation.    Both did their job, his book is very practical and I DO recommend it because:  1. It's very well structured both in format and content, so it's easy to read.  2. It talks about scheduling, planning for value (e.g. Kano Model).  3. It justifies very well the benefits of the agile approach.    So if you're a Project Manager who needs to plan and track projects using agile methods like Scrum, this book may give you 75% of what you need to know.

031606792X|5.0|Reading the reviews of this book is an odd experience.  Why anyone would buy, supposedly read, and trash a book out of curiosity or to see what the hype is about is beyond me.  I certainly did not need to get to the last book in the series to know if it was my type of book or not...    And it is.  It was superb from the very cute vehicle scene in the first chapter through the end.    And I am nowhere near alone in my liking of the book.  The nice thing about books (and movies for that matter) is that you don't have to look at the ratings or read the reviews to see if it was any good or liked by others (or whatever).  You just have to look at sales - the real test.  And like the others in the series, this one passes with flying colors...    So let them squeal.  The real test has already been passed.
B0010VD7EO|3.0|I've given it some thought, and I think I may have to hand the Most Overrated Band of 2008 award to MGMT (or at least have them share it with Fleet Foxes). I know there are plenty of worse, overhyped bands that debuted in '08, but MGMT is the only one that tricked me into getting the whole album. The album is almost comletely made up of filler songs to help out radio singles such as \\"Time To Pretend,\\" \\"Kids,\\" and \\"Electric Feel.\\" I have to admit, if I'd only heard those three songs, I'd place this album at the top of my \\"Must Have\\" list, but since I got it before I knew any better I now know that these guys aren't all they're made out to be. I just don't know what it is about this album that stands out so much. It's not unique or special in anyway, yet it still managed to grab the top spot on all of the year end lists. I guess it's just one of those albums that opens new doors for people.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I've recently been focusing my record collection on more obscure indie bands, but when Viva La Vida hit stores I was curious as to how the band attempted to avoid all criticism. The result was very unique, and I'm sure the critics who complained of similarities to U2 are pleased. But really...is that what it's all about? Many critics complained that Coldplay's last release, 2005's X&Y, sounded too much like an old U2 album. First of all, I loved that album and I'm not even a U2 fan. Second of all, not all bands have to sound unique. Honestly, I would have been happy with another album that sounded like X&Y. One trait that I find utterly unattractive about a band is that they are so worried about pleasing everyone that their music changes after they are accused of sounding like any other band. But aside from the fact that I think Coldplay are a bunch of self-righteous pushovers, I think they're great guys with a good sense of humor. I was pleasantly surprised with what they did on Viva La Vida, with the exception of one song only: \\"Viva La Vida.\\" I just don't understand what all the fuss is about. It was the first song I heard off the new album and it almost convinced me not to buy it. So to sum up my mixed feelings, Coldplay would possibly be my favorite band if they weren't so freaking popular. To put it simply, they're the band I hate to love.
0525421033|5.0|Although I'd read the synopsis multiple times, I never really \\"got\\" what the story was until I read the first chapter when it all happens. When you find out Mia is making the choice as her body lays waiting in the ICU. She becomes an invisible observer, watching and narrating her tragic ordeal from the time the accident happens. And it is here that we join her on her quest. To ultimately decide to stay or to let go.<br /><br />The choice is resonated through flashbacks, that feature Mia's parents, brother Teddy, boyfriend Adam, her love of the cello and her best friend Kim. While the prose of the novel would seemingly be depressing, these glimpses are filled with hope, love and often times laughter. Helping the reader better understand Mia's struggle between life and death.<br /><br />Though the novel is clearly small in its mere 208 pages, it doesn't seem inadequate in any way possible. Forman's writing is gripping, demanding that the pages are turned. The story is exceptional.<br /><br />Despite the solemn tone, I didn't find myself shedding any tears until the last three pages of the novel. Not that I didn't feel my emotions stirring throughout the entire novel, especially a scene including Mia and her grandfather, but I think my emotions bubbled until the last possilbe moment when they finally spilled over the edge.<br /><br />A powerful novel, intense, and moving. You can't help but find yourself taking note of the people and things that make your life worth living, after this experience.
B000092ZYX|3.0|The funny thing about Radiohead is that their music is either hit or miss. No, I'm not talking about their albums, I'm talking about their songs. The only way to judge how good one of their albums is is by the number of outstanding tracks it contains. This album only contained four or five strong tracks, a huge step down from both Kid A and Amnesiac, the two previous releases from the band that shared the electronic influence of Hail To The Thief. Unfortunately, this is also the band's longest release at almost an hour, with fourteen strange and mostly forgetable tracks. The main problem I had with this album was that it had no stand out tracks. I mean, there were some great songs, but every other Radiohead album has at least one or two tracks that I can play over and over and never get tired of. On the other hand, the album doesn't have any tracks that I just can't stand and will always skip. This is just one of those albums that you buy and listen to once and you just never feel like listening to the whole thing again, and Radiohead shouldn't be the kind of band to release music like that. I guess I'm on the fence on this one.
1416914307|5.0|Why am I finding it so difficult to write this review. I've been stewing for days- literally- writing this review in my head- while I'm trying to fall asleep, while I'm in the shower, while driving, which really isn't such a good idea, and yet everything has ended up crap. Although I did have something going before I feel asleep the other night, and of course I have forgotten it.<br /><br />I'm saddened to see this series end, but even so I thought that it ended perfectly. No cookie- cuter, sweetened overload, just a perfectly seamless ending. Sure I'd like to know what may happen next, but I'm perfectly content with leaving that open to my own realm of possibility.<br /><br />The Mortal Instruments is on of my favorite series' and City of Glass is now one of my all time favorite novels. Cassandra Clare is an amazing story-teller. Sure some parts of the novel were a little predictable, but I can honestly say that didn't bother me. There were a lot of things that surprised me! The subtle clues that Clare had placed within the previous two novels, came rushing back with clarity and I was aghast with how I had missed so much before!<br /><br />As much as I wanted to read this book, there was a small part of me that didn't. While I'd devoured Clare's previous novels in a day, I took my time to relish in this final chapter. I was emotionally invested in these characters, and I didn't want to see it end. And yet as the novel progressed, I was content as it came to a close. Clare kept true to her characters, she didn't change their characterization because she wanted the novel to end a certain way, and I think I feel the need to appraise that more than anything. Too many times in a series, do I see characters take a dramatic turn just to enhance the story. Sure characters grow and develop that is expected, but don't solidify a characters persona only to destroy it.<br /><br />The exceptional writing and the articulate plot kept me engaged and entertained, but for me it was the superb cast of characters that kept me reading this series.<br /><br />Speaking of exceptional writing. Clare has it going on. It takes a lot for me to get into imagery. I just can't imagine something that is being described to me, well most of the time. There are a few exceptions and Clare's writings is one of them. And not only that but, I love that fact that she clearly gives each character a distinct voice. When I read her dialogue I know who is talking right away. And I love that!<br /><br />What else can I say... I loved this books. I love this series. It's everything a good novel should be and then some. And I love how pretty the books look on my bookshelf. :)hat kept me reading this series.    Speaking of exceptional writing.

0441009425|1.0|This review refers to the audiobook. I'll pass on a plot synopsis, partly because the publisher & other readers offer some, & partly because I'm several hours into the audiobook and still have scarcely a clue what's going on [Edit; I'm done, & still not sure.] There are several people on several planets &/or spaceships in several time periods, doing things, but I have no idea where it's all going, nor where it's been.<br />I haven't read the book in visual form and I'm not convinced even that would be comprehensible.  Part of the problem is the reader's fault; he does not pause,  even slightly, at scene or chapter changes. The book will jump character, time, & setting all at once but there is no cue at all to let the listener know of the transition.  I'm a lifelong reader of hard science fiction, but I'm not sure I could keep track of this tossed salad of who-when-where even in print.<br /><br />The character names do not help; on one ship there are people named what sounds like \\"Sudjick\\" &  \\"Sudjacki,\\" both of whom have rather cheesy Russian accents (though this could certainly be a device of the reader, along with cheesy French accents & cheesy Japanese accents: would people of the future, tooling around the universe, really have the same cartoonlike accents as today's?).<br />I've read &/or heard & enjoyed 2 other Alistair Reynold books --Pushing Ice & Century Rain.  I am definitely not enjoying this one; it's irritating as all hail.<br /><br />It's easy to believe that this is Reynold's first work; it has the neophyte's habit of tossing out cool, futuristic-sounding terms that mean nothing, sometimes defining them dozens of chapters after they first appear, often not bothering to define them at all, just dropping cool/techno words that leave the reader feeling sort of \\"primitive.\\" Some authors can create a new universe with its own terms and have it work -RM Meluch's \\"Merrimack\\" books spring to mind.  This author in this work fails utterly, and it is profoundly annoying to listen to.  I've backed up & re-listened to the first 4-5 chapters many times, trying to figure out what's going on, what those things are, and who is doing what where and when.  I also went back & checked several times to make sure this wasn't a sequel to another book, thinking a lot of this garbage must have been explained previously.  If I hadn't paid a lot for the audiobook, I would've thrown it out the metaphorical window.<br />I would strongly recommend that no one waste hard-earned money on this audiobook.annoying to listen to.

B001PNVYMO|5.0|I've seen a number of magazine reviews of Pet Shop Boy's new CD, \\"Yes,\\" claiming that it's their best since \\"Nightlife\\" (1999) or even \\"Very\\" (1993).  I was skeptical at first; however, after repeated listens, I have to agree.  Now, I love pretty much everything PSB do, but \\"Yes\\" is pretty spectacular, with a heavy emphasis on lush vocals and strings layered over dance beats, which is the sound that made me such a fan of PSBs back in the 1980s.<br /><br />The first single is the upbeat \\"Love Etc.\\" The song is about the hollowness of living the material life without love; certainly a well-worn topic, but the boys manage to craft a solid single. The song has a catchy if repetitive chorus - You need more/ you need more/ you need more/ you need loooooove. I prefer the verses, with background singers chanting phrases like \\"don't have to have\\" leading into Neil enumerating various trappings of money, such as \\"a house in Beverly Hills.\\"  I have to admit that I don't find \\"Love Etc.\\" to be the most original PSB single, but I do like it.  In the U.K., the boys continue to have solid success. \\"Love Etc.\\" debuted at #14 on the singles charts, continuing their trend of top 20 hits (only two of their singles have ever peaked lower - \\"Was It Worth It\\" in 1991 and \\"Numb\\" in 2006).<br /><br />My favorite song on \\"Yes\\" is the lush, mid-tempo \\"King of Rome,\\" which reminds me of some of their slower moments from the \\"Behaviour\\" era, such as \\"Only the Wind\\" or \\"To Face the Truth.\\"  The melody is beautiful and Neil's vocals positively throb with melancholia.  I also love the danceable \\"All Over the World,\\" which is probably the most stereotypically PSB song on the CD.  Sampling Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker,\\" the song is upbeat, joyous, and a bit over the top in the tradition of other great PSB anthems.  It's another one of their (very successful) attempts to put \\"Debussy to a disco beat\\" - well in this case it's Tchaikovsky.  The third song I'd like to highlight is \\"Beautiful People.\\"  Not many fans seem to be talking about this song, but I think it's an amazing track.  Neil's vocals have rarely sounded better, and the song is fresh while also blending perfectly into the other material on \\"Yes.\\"  By the way, the second single is rumored to be the extremely chipper \\"Did You See Me Coming?\\" which features a very catchy chorus, although it's not one of my favorite songs.<br /><br />Much has been made of the fact that \\"Yes\\" was co-produced by British hit-meisters Xenophobia (Sugababes, Girls Aloud).  I honestly don't know enough about their work to know how much \\"Yes\\" sounds like their typical output.  However, \\"Yes\\" sounds like a great PSB CD, so fans needn't worry that \\"Yes\\" tries too hard to sound ultra-current.  In fact, \\"Yes\\" most reminds me of 1990s \\"Behaviour,\\" which also happens to be one of my favorite PSB CDs.  Neil and Chris have never, imo, put out a bad CD, so I knew I'd like \\"Yes.\\"  However, I'm finding that I'm listening to and enjoying it far more than I did \\"Fundamental\\" and \\"Release.\\"<br /><br />The second disk (\\"Etc.\\") contains remixes of several songs from \\"Yes\\" (More Than a Dream, Pandemonium, The Way It Used to Be, All Over the World, Vulnerable, Love Etc.) and one new song.  The remixes are uniformly good and quite varied.  The new song is \\"This Used to be the Future,\\" which according to some sources was originally scheduled to be included on \\"Yes.\\"  It would have sounded right at home, although it's a bit more electro than some of the other music.

0739368435|5.0|Very enjoyable.  A series of letters written during the Nazi occupation of Guernsey during WWII.  It was read by a variety of actors who beautifully depicted the characters style and feel.  Highly recommend this book -- especially in the audio version.

B000GY729M|3.0|The Killers faced the same problem many bands do after releasing a successful debut: Should they stick to the same formula or explore new territory? They chose the latter, and the results are mixed. On the positive side, lead single \\"When You Were Young\\" manages to sound fresh and ranks aside some of the best from Hot Fuss. Other highlights like \\"The River is Wild\\" and \\"Bones\\" are intriguing and well-crafted, but even they seem like diversions, weak compared to past glories. The best song is \\"Read My Mind,\\" which, unsurprisingly, is as close to Hot Fuss as Sam's Town gets. The majority of the album attempts to copy rock classics like Born to Run and The Joshua Tree; The Killers were brave to experiment, but they weren't ready to take on such a daunting task. Compared to the debut, this is a disappointment. 3 Stars.

B00005QGAX|4.0|Michael Jackson produced Bad to be a bigger, better Thriller. While he couldn't match the sheer phenomenon of that release, he came very close. Bad spawned some of his most memorable singles. The title track is cheesy but undeniably well-crafted and infectious, while \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is a classic, shuffling R&B number. \\"Man in the Mirror\\" is Michael at his most syrupy, gospel choir and all. Quite the opposite is \\"Smooth Criminal,\\" with its unsettling lyrics and equally creepy, claustrophobic beat. A recording of his own heartbeat opens the murder-themed track. \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is a gorgeous ballad; Michael's and Siedah's voices mesh together brilliantly. An attempt to recreate \\"Beat It\\" with \\"Dirty Diana\\" fails, while a duet with Stevie Wonder on \\"Just Good Friends\\" seems to collapse under the weight of such a pairing. Despite a few throwaways, album tracks like \\"Speed Demon\\" and \\"Leave Me Alone\\" are gritty ventures into Michael Jackson's unparalleled imagination. As a highly produced record of immense variety, Bad represents the ultimate in pop perfection. Creating a follow-up to the most successful album of all time had to be incredibly daunting; with Bad, Michael Jackson proved he was up to the challenge. 4 Stars.    The well-packaged special edition comes with updated liner notes and extra tracks featuring a few b-sides and interview clips with Quincy Jones. Aside from the remastered sound, these bonuses do little to improve the original product but are enjoyable nonetheless.
B0015KGJMM|5.0|Well, I just cannot understand a 2* rating for this magnificent performance - the recording dates from 1993 and has been re-mastered several times, this issue w/ SACD; I do not own a SACD player so comments are based on listening to the regular CD layer.  I have a number of versions of this music (and have 'culled out' others from my collection over the years), but must say that this is the most vibrant and dynamic performance that I've ever heard; now this may be 'disturbing' to those expecting a more mellow approach, but when this music was performed initially, Handel wanted ALL to hear it, and Savall comes through with much vigor.<br /><br />David Vernier from ClassicsToday has reviewed several of these re-releases, and just a sentence quoted: \\"Literally bursting with energy, scintillating strings, blazing horns, and incisive winds, and never boring even for one second, these performances give you Handel at his most exciting.\\" He gave this performance a 10/10 rating for performance & sound - but I must warn that if you plan to listen to this disc at a high volume, then put on your seat belt!  Enjoy.

B0000032LS|5.0|It's definitely a must-have for fans of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and it is great.  Although it's missing a few tunes, that partially adds to the enjoyment.  Actually, I'm just trying to make it sound better than it is, but seriously, it doesn't ruin it that much.  I feel that the addition of not only a remix of \\"The Time Warp\\" does more than make up for the missing tunes, but an instrumental mix of the remix adds to it.  Although there are missing tracks, this is the soundtrack album of The Rocky Horror Picture Show to get.<br /><br />I think that the arrangement of \\"Science Fiction/Double Feature\\" is a great arrangement, but I personally prefer the usually stage production arrangement because it's more of a happy song, and this arrangement made it more of a ballad than it really is.  However, I enjoy the arrangement, and I think that the orchestrating is wonderful.  I feel that the reprise of the song is the perfect arrangement because it's after the ending, and the story is a tragedy.<br /><br />\\"Damn It, Janet\\" is very well done, and I personally feel that Barry Bostwick's performance, and Susan Sarandon's performance are pretty much the definitive performances of Brad and Janet that everyone looks to.  I do like how in stage production arrangements, Brad starts the singing earlier on, but the audience can add a few lines with this arrangement.<br /><br />\\"Over at the Frankenstein Place\\" is one of my favorite songs from the show.  I especially love the bridge, sung by Richard O'Brien.  I don't like how in the film, Brad's verse was deleted, but I think that the arrangement does more than make up for it.<br /><br />\\"The Time Warp\\" is the big hit from the album and movie, and it's a good fun song.  The tap dance section was deleted from the song on the album, but that's just a small disappointment.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Transvestite\\" is where Tim Curry first comes into the picture, and his performance is considered the greatest for a reason.  Although he was much more energetic on the Roxy Cast album, this is a great arrangement.<br /><br />\\"The Charles Atlas Song\\" on this album uses different lyrics than the stage version.  I don't really have a preference on which one is better or worse.  I also like the arrangement for the film better, but now just about every stage production has the early silent movie style piano during a couple of parts of the song.  The reprise is really just an extension of the song.<br /><br />\\"Hot Patootie\\" is done almost perfectly.  Meat Loaf seems to be one of the only Eddies that did a good job with that role, and I think he's also one of the only good Dr. Scotts.  He's probably the only actor I know of that pulled off both parts, unless I'm forgetting about an actor I saw live.<br /><br />\\"Touch Me\\" is done really well here.  I personally like the original stage arrangement where Rocky sings the chorus of \\"Hot Patootie\\" in along with the final couple of repeats of the chorus.  I feel that the repeating of \\"Creature of the night\\" from all of the characters works.<br /><br />\\"Eddie's Teddy\\" was written sometime while the original production was going.  I feel that Meat Loaf's performance was much better than Jonathon Adams' performance.  However, this was much more comedic.  I feel that the German accent ruins the part more than it helps because Frank is supposed to be incorrect about Dr. Scott being a nazi.  Isn't he?<br /><br />\\"Rose Tint My World\\" is great, like always.  It's basically the one song where almost everyone in the cast sings, and I think that the arrangement here is one of the best.<br /><br />\\"I'm Going Home\\" is one of my favorite songs from the film, and I think that this is one of the best arrangements.  I think that Tim Curry's performance was better on the Roxy Cast album, but I didn't like the xylophone or organ from that arrangement.<br /><br />They actually had \\"Super Heroes\\" on this album.  I thought it was deleted from the movie.  The arrangement for \\"Super Heroes\\" is another one of those classic arrangements, and it's one of my favorite arrangements.<br /><br />Although there are missing tunes, this is the album to start with.there are missing tunes, this is the album to start with.
B000GPIPT2|5.0|Frankenstein, the most celebrated of the Universal monster movies, released only 4-years into the sound era, continues to find its way into the American Film Institute's Top 100 films list and is continually called one of the best horror films ever made.    The film opens with the warning;  \\"I think it will thrill you, it may shock you, it might even horrify you. So if any of you feel that you'd not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now is your chance to...Well, we've warned you.\\"    We're quickly introduced to Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and his hunch-backed assistant (Dwight Frye) as they rob graveyards and the gallows for fresh cadavers. His goal is to create a living, breathing human from these spare parts, which he eventually, of course, does. This is a widely-known premise that has a 71-minute running time. For me to reveal anymore wouldn't quite be blasphemous but there's no point.    Of course, I have to mention one of the film's most legendary scenes in which the Monster encounters a young girl who accepts him and hands him some flowers which she demonstrates will float when thrown into the lake. When he runs out of flowers, he does the next logical thing and throws her into the lake. When he realizes she is not floating, like the flowers, he flees in horror. This scene is beautifully shot and the lack of musical score makes it even more haunting.     The film has beautiful art direction, even in the darkest, gloomiest sets. Also contributing to the timelessness of the film is the ominous photography, especially effective in the opening scenes with Henry Frankenstein and Fritz.    The performances are worthy of mention, as well. Colin Clive plays Henry Frankenstein with a demented ferocity...When he screams \\"it's alive! It's alive!\\" you can really feel the sense of accomplishment pulsating from the brain of a madman.    Then there's Boris Karloff in a performance that relies predominantly upon his brute physicality and minimal dialogue (i.e., grunting). It's this terrific performance that provided the archetype for the overall look and generally accepted image of the Monster.  It is widely considered a great performance and for a good reason. Besides embodying one of the most well-known characters in film history, Karloff gives this character tremendous sympathy...I believe Bela Lugosi was more impressive in his [[ASIN:B000GPIPSS Dracula (75th Anniversary Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)]] role, but he would not have been able to bring the amount of depth to this role that Karloff did.    I mention this because Lugosi famously turned down the role. A mistake for his career, a great thing for us filmgoers.    It's no mystery why the story of the Monster appealed to the openly gay director James Whale, but maybe the exploration of a (possibly) gay subtext is better suited to the film's sequel [[ASIN:078323502X The Bride of Frankenstein]]. Frankenstein is unlikely to shock or horrify any member  of today's horror audience who have been desensitized by films like [[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]] and [[ASIN:B000EHRVP6 Hostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]], but it still retains its power to fascinate.    GRADE: A
0634060384|4.0|Because they sometimes give you some of the inversions, voicings, and additional changes, this book isn't the best book.  Fake books are supposed to give you just the basic progression and the melody, and they might sometimes have the feel and the form.  This book might get too detailed, but it's a pretty good book.  It's missing some of the classics, and it has a few more obscure tunes, but it really is a great book.<br /><br />I think that the weaknesses might be good for beginners to have an understanding of chords, and it's also a pretty good book to use if you want to practice sight reading and improvisation.  It also is a good book to look at if you're interested in being a songwriter or composer, or if you're at least doing some songwriting or composition.<br /><br />I guess calling it the definitive fake book, which is what it is pretty much thought of in the musician community, is definitely an exaggeration, but because it's the book that almost every musician you'll meet when you're at a jam session will have, at least with them, it is important to get this book, even if this book was completely crappy.<br /><br />Also, this is the first thing that I ordered off of Amazon.com, so it must be a good item.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory changed my life, it absolutely CHANGED my life, it made me want to listen to rock, metal, death metal, and everything I listen to today, your earlier albums HT and Meteora helped me discover everything I love about music and I became a musician myself as a result.       I waited YEARS for you to put out a new album, I waited and waited for every drop of news I could possibly find. Then that day finally came when Minutes To Midnight was finally released.. it turned out to be the worst day of my life. I destroyed your cd within an hour of purchasing it and I'll never look back on it. This album is emo/pop mainstream garbage and I'll have none of it.

0312330537|5.0|Well worth the time it takes to read 900+ pages.  I didn't want it to end.  So beautifully thought out, gracefully articulated, the story is unbelievable real and life-changing. Rich, lucid, lovely, heart-breaking and heart-opening. A view of life not many live. Do read it.
B001C3KCSY|2.0|Well, I love kol, atleast every other album other than this one. They usually have this intense southern rock screaming and just rocking out vibe. One that makes your whole body move. But, this album is sooo boring, its like emo soft rock. I am soo sad and disapointed with their new direction and I hope their next album returns to their roots!

B0010YPTGU|4.0|Musically it is as good as it can get, but the comments - though subtitled - are somehow excessive and unnecessary. There are not as many of them as in some André Rieu shows, but still a few we could live without tending to drag the concert into a cheaper side. Otherwise, the concert is excellent (5 star) including the sound and picture quality, the choice (order) of songs, and the performance positively affecting its dynamics and emotional side progressing from lyric through romantic to more dramatic, and culminating at the end.  Tracks: (Live Concert DVD)  1. MELODRAMMA  2. ROMANZA  3. A TE (Featuring Kenny G on soprano saxophone)  4. VIVO PER LEI (Duet with Heather Headley)  5. IO CI SARÒ (Featuring Lang Lang on piano)  6.

Otherwise, the concert is excellent (*****) including the sound and picture quality, the choice (order) of songs, and the performance positively affecting the concert's dynamics and emotional side progressing from lyric through romantic to more dramatic, and culminating at the end.<br /><br />Bocelli's voice is slightly darker, more mature then in 'A Night in Tuscany' made 10 years earlier, and the chosen songs in both concerts are perfectly rendered except the initial seven from 1997, which sound somewhat flat, weak, muffled, not clear, as if from stressed and not warmed up vocal cords, but maybe due to recording errors. This concert is more dynamic than the equally exquisite 'My Christmas' where fortunately Foster's talk is shorter, more professional, better scripted, better integrated with, and supporting that show of 2009 instead of himself.
141690977X|5.0|I got this book about a week ago and I've already finished it. I told my friend about it and she wants to borrow it! It's an easy read- but a great read. After having constant frustration with trying to understand why a guy would stop calling, stop seeming interested, not being as interested in me as I was in him, etc. this book explained it; \\"he's just not that into you.\\" There's different chapters on different situations of \\"he's just not that into you if...\\" It was a wake up call I needed. The good news is now I can know when a guy isn't that into me & go out & find one that is:)

B001EYU1VO|5.0|As far as portable joysticks go (there aren't all that many) this joystick is topnotch. It breaks down into two pieces, and the base folds up into a compact package for easy traveling! The adjustability of this stick is also second to none...whatever your hand size, seating position etc, this joystick will be able to accommodate you. The stick adjusts in about every plane, the throttle stick is located in the perfect position (if you're a righty), and the button layout is also well done, and all easily accessible by the left hand without any effort. NOTE: This is a travel joystick, the tracking, profile settings, layout and such are better than some sticks costing twice as much...that said, this is not a full HOTAS (like the x52) and doesn't have as many button combos....it does smoke both the Av8tor, and other similar formed logitech sticks...i definitely recommend!

1596912863|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down. I NEVER have time to read due to work and children, but made time for this book. I finished it in two days, I wish it was longer so I could continue reading it. Just as in Pride and Prejudice, I am kept wondering what happened to the two main characters after the book ended. I won't give anything away, but you will not be diasapointed if you pick this book up.  One problem - she kept referring to Aunt Caroline and in the beginning her name was Aunt Carolyn. Is it bad editing or am I missing a reference to a Jane Austen novel.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|In recent years, Guy Ritchie has been growing on me.  After this film, I've squarely chalked that up to when I came to movie watching age.    I turned 17 in 1993 just as Quentin Tarantino was starting out.  When I reached college, Reservoir Dogs was playing late every Saturday night at one of the seediest U-District (that's Seattle) movie theaters.  Then came Pulp Fiction.  Wow.     Rock N Rolla brought back some of that youthful feeling of movie watcing awe.  I'll say that I'd liken Ritchie to the UK version of Tarantino, but still with his own style.    Rock N Rolla, however, did have a good many scenes reminiscent of Pulp Fiction (the Gimp, the Twist contest, some of the strange monologues, the painting = the case with the light in it), but I still felt it was it's own story.    I'm definitely looking forward to the next two installments in this planned trilogy.    (Also, with this new found understanding of Ritchie, I can better 'understand' Revolver which was a mystery wrapped in an enigma covered by ten layers of onion.)

B0000CFW87|4.0|Just as great as his 1st album with even more power and melody to his song choices.  Always a pleasure to listen to him!
B001MYIXAC|4.0|The other reviews are stating that you should hold off until you can get a hand on the original theatre dubbing of the movie but I still found the Magnolia release adequate. I've seen my share of badly dubbed movies and this was a decent dub.    As for the movie itself, I found it chilling but sweet. I can't find a way to describe those aspects without spoilers so I'll just say this; if you love vampire movies, you'll love this. A human boy meeting a vampire girl; the awkward and disturbed boy with the girl with adult eyes.

1416562605|4.0|Thus we take ourselves too seriously....humor on display to tackle very real social issues of caste and how do we break down and out of those \\"rooster coops\\".  One man's rather different journey to breaking out of the coop illustrates the depth and gravity of the challenge unto itself for those living in this caste driven society.  The real satisfaction with those that feel they have made it out...  Great and enjoyable read!

B001CDLATE|2.0|Well, no, maybe there was a theme: we stink.<br /><br />We are wasteful (hundreds of military aircraft sitting in the Arizona desert), brutal (Cambodia's killing fields, Auschwitz), ephemeral (Egyptian ruins), vain (Amazon and African tribes in the most colorful dress), exploitive (numbing assembly lines, cigarette factories, prostitution), and oblivious to suffering (chicken processing plants, scavenging in trash heaps).<br /><br />We're also religious (countless scenes). Was that the director's message? That for all our faith and devotion, we're despicable?<br /><br />And that nature is magnificent? Waterfalls, volcanoes, springbok enjoying the first rains, pensive monkeys soaking in hot springs?<br /><br />I love the beauty of nature, too, but crowded cities also give us schools, orchestras, and hospitals. Not to mention employment, safe drinking water, and a diversity of thought not possible in nature.<br /><br />The photographer's skill and effort is obvious. I wish he'd had a director with a vision of what to photograph.<br /><br />Finally, the comparison to Koyaanisqatsi is not in this film's favor.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />5 October 2014, I watch &#34;Samsara&#34; and am overwhelmed with its brilliance. Many of the images would not leave me that night.<br /><br />Am I wrong wondering why we were given Israeli checkpoints and the border wall but not the reason for it, the victims of bus, restaurant and school bombings, their bodies shredded with the most pain-inflicting shrapnel possible?<br /><br />A week later, I see &#34;Chronos&#34; and decide that Mr Fricke is captivated by The Image -- and few others can present images as well -- but is muddleheaded about their meanings. Like an idiot-savant child who plays beautiful piano, he gives us pretty pictures with no idea of their meaning or history.<br /><br />I'm also put off by his too-frequent use of the same types of images -- time-lapse photography of big-city traffic; scavenging in garbage dumps; southwest American vistas; for example -- in all or most of his films.<br /><br />I would ask Mr Fricke to drop natural scenes altogether -- leave them to BBC, which does them quite well -- and give us only what man has touched. For better or worse, we are more amazing, both more beautiful and more ugly, than anything in nature.al scenes altogether -- leave them to BBC, which does them quite well -- and give us only what man has touched.

B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian is no-nonsense and doesn't waste your time with chirpy banter.  She gives modifications for many of the exercises and is super easy to follow.  This DVD has no strange or difficult moves. It is built on basics and the only gear it requires is small hand weights. I'm an experienced gym-goer and found level one to be sufficiently challenging to keep me there daily for a week before moving on.  If you have knee problems, I'd suggest further modification of the jumping cardio moves. Even if you substitute the bouncing motions for stationary boxing while walking briskly in place, you can still get great benefit from this workout. I'd give it 5 stars, but have to disagree with Jillian on two things:  1. She mods the squat and lunge moves in a way that creates knee problems by suggesting you go part way into the move.  This is hell on the knees.  If you go all the way down, you will use your largest muscle, the Gluteals, and your hamstrings to power back up.  This takes stress OFF the knee.  To mod this for beginners or those with knee issues, I would say do full squats but slow down and decrease the reps until you build strength. 2.  She makes a big point to discourage EVERYONE from modifying jumping jacks.  I think if your knees hurt, skip jumping jacks.  There are plenty of simple ways to get the heart rate up without jumping and I think people should be encouraged and motivated to do what they can rather than be made to feel inadequate or guilty for wanting to avoid jumping.  Other than that, I do love her personality and approach and am loving this workout.  If you did this daily and also got some brisk outdoor exercise in, you'd be well on your way to experiencing results right away.

B001NFNFNU|3.0|I loved the cinematography, costumes and music score but as for the movie itself, I didn't care for the story.  I am not at all interested in or fascinated with the subject matter of a child seriel killer.  The movie itself was also boring, it lumbered along and I guess you have to really be into the story for it to be entertaining at that point.  I thought Clint Eastwood did a great job directing but the whole plot was just too disturbing and I guess I didn't really care about the characters in the end.

B001PA0FF4|5.0|Every morning most of us wake up and flip the coin. On one side of the coin is faith and the other doubt. While this movie deals with the suspicions of an uptight nun (Meryl Streep), a young acolayte (Amy Adams)about whether the beloved Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman)abused a young boy, it's really about doubt and faith (hence the title)as well as what motivates us to embrace one or the other.Father Flynn has taken a young African American boy under his wing--the first in a white school consisting of people of Irish and Italian descent. He clearly identifies with the boy. Different people will come away with different impressions (this isn't really a mystery focusing on whether or not he did it as much as what and why we choose to believe)after watching this and it does reward with mulitple viewings.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks absolutely stunning. I also saw a preview of the DVD and it looks quite good as well. Both have the same special features including a commentary track with John Patrick Shanley. He's engaging, entertaining and informative unlike some solo commentary tracks. We also get a very good making of featurette, one that focuses on the \\"Sisters of Charity\\" order that the nuns belong to in the film. We also hear from various nuns as to their impression of the play and film (particularly from the woman that inspired Sister James played by Adams who was one of Shanley's teachers). The only thing missing is a joint commentary track from the cast although Hoffman, Adams and Streep do appear in a segment answering questions about the film, their roles. They all give thoughtful, entertaining and intelligent answers.<br /><br />John Patrick Shanley has done a terrific job adapting his play to the screen making it more cinematic in often subtle (and not so subtle)ways. The performances are brilliant--all three main actors were deservedly nominated for Oscars as was the film itself. Shanley expertly mines his experience raised in the Roman Catholic faith and being taunt at a Catholic school in Boston. Set in 1964 \\"Doubt\\" symbolizes the winds of change that were shaking the nation, politics and the Catholic Church with Vatican II. This film isn't really about the Catholic Church nor is it about the alleged abuse itself and how it is dealt with but it's really about the conflict between doubt, faith, old and the new way of doing things in a institution struggling to remain relevant during the turbulent 1960's.<br /><br />In the end all you can do is wake up in the morning, flip the coin and hope for the best but you won't be flipping a coin when it comes to the quality of this terrific drama. There's no risk involved. Highly recommendedat a Catholic school in Boston.

B00006LJ6X|5.0|I have had the pleasure of seeing Chicago in concert twice. The first time was in Madison Square Garden N.Y., Terry Kath's last concert before  he died of a self inflicted gun shot wound in the mouth. I was stunned to have seen him at his last concert and a few day's later to hear he was dead. Chicago went downhill after that.<br /><br />The second time I saw Chicago was at the Neal Blaisdell arena in Honolulu in 2008. For this second concert, I took my wife who loved Chicago. Unfortunately, she is 17 years younger than me and only knows Chicago for their sappy love songs. Her comments when she learned I bought the tickets was , \\"Wow! I get to hear -enter name of sappy love song here-\\" and i was, Oh, God... I hope not!<br /><br />She asked me why that comment and i told her that she had no idea who the REAL Chicago was and that I prayed that they stuck with what originally made them great, their Jazz/Rock fusion fro Chicago Transit Authority on up to Chicago 7. After that, it's all fluff.<br /><br />Surprise! Chicago ROCKED! The primarily played their earlier stuff and bigger surprise, my wife walked out of the concert in awe. \\"I had no idea\\"! No babe, you had no idea and many still don't. Oh, I forgot to mention... I also took my eight year old son to the concert. His first concert had to be special and this was it. He may not have appreciated it that much, but when he's older, he'll know just how cool his parents were (I hope).<br /><br />To me, Chicago stopped being chicago after Chicago 7, the album I consider to be their finest and one of the best albums ever.<br /><br />So now, totally stunned, my wife wanted their early stuff but guess what? The only Chicago CD's you can find in stores are their \\"Greatest Hit's\\" and \\"Best of\\" albums. Arrrrgh! And that is how Chicago has finally been defined.<br /><br />I was lucky to find one copy of Chicago V and I quickly shoved that on my wife's Zune. She loves it. Now it's time to completely indoctrinate her with Chicago 7. This album represents Chicago at their purest. Everything after this album, after Terry Kaths death, is a mere shadow of what the band was and what could have been. Terry was Chicago.<br /><br />If you buy any Chicago albums, buy the first seven and make Chicago 7 the first purchase of these great treasures.<br /><br />Time to complete my order!<br /><br />By the way, I have two copies of Chicago 7 on vinyl, two items which I will never ever part with. -Koa-.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|In [[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]], a brilliant set of characters work to create a thought-provoking film worthy of discussion. What is the basis for that which drives us?<br /><br />It works both ways, and the film is doubly interesting to watch twice: once from the perspective of the priest-in-suspect (Hoffman) and once from the perspective of the principal (Streep). One can observe that from either side the situation is not clear cut, and therein lies the conflict; without evidence, we as humans fall back on what we like to believe, not on what is known.<br /><br />Of note is that the film purposely leaves open ends. Without this the film would end shortly before the credits roll. Instead, the audience is given a gem: self-reflection. In our own lives, we, like Sister Aloysius, have doubts.
