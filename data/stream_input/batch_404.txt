0316666343|1.0|This book starts with a sickly suggestive and accurate description of a rape and a murder.  I can say that the rape was too close to home for me... as I was raped as a teen... and spent years dealing with my fear of men... <br />Several weeks ago my lovely adopted daughter began to act out and have severe mood swings, lack of sleep, snuck out after midnight, totalled my car, tried to run away, and even told the police that found her that she had been attacked by me!<br />Then I find my own adopted teenaged daugther, who had been raped as a toddler by her father, had been assigned this sick and totally inappropriate book by her English teacher.  She has been haunted by only half understood memories... dredged up by this perverted book... and now she has to write a term paper on this disgusting book.  Please don't buy it, or give it to teens to read.
B000002LB6|5.0|It's really sad, the number of times I have seen The Circus in used CD bins over the years.  In a lot of ways, this is one of Erasure's strongest albums.  As most people know, Wonderland, their first album, was something of a dud.  The follow-up, Circus, is the first album to establish the \\"Erasure\\" sound throughout.  More importantly, it tackles a lot of social issues without being preachy or precious, an uncanny ability Erasure always had.  During the course of Circus, we hear about racial injustice (It Doesn't Have to Be), homophobia (Hideaway), peace & harmony (If I Could), and the plight of the working class (The Circus).  However, with their catchy hooks, lyrics, and Andy's fine singing, you have enough else to concentrate on without feeling \\"preached\\" to!<br />The album opens with It Doesn't Have to Be, which didn't get any airplay in America (at least in my memory), but is one of their best songs, in my opinion.  Apart from being just a great song overall, it draws upon African percussion rhythms, and even has Andy singing in Swahili(?).  Everytime I hear it, I think of the video, where he is waving the sparklers around.  Next comes Hideaway, which has a lot of personal meaning for me as a gay man, although fortunately I wasn't \\"rejected by the people that I cared for!\\" Aside from the subject matter, it's another good song.  <br />Don't Dance seems to be a favorite with other reviewers, and I have to agree.  It's a testimony to Erasure's talent that even the \\"non-singles\\" can sound this good.  If I Could, which comes after, is another one that affects me.  The song seems to be about a broken relationship, but the refrain, \\"If I could make the world a little better, you know I would,\\" suggests something else entirely- a heartfelt cry for world peace. Sexuality is a notch below the rest, only because sonically it's somewhat jumbled. On the other hand, it's one of their most provocative songs ever, with lyrics like, \\"let's not pretend you're shy about it\\" and \\"strip it, do it\\".  Victim of Love, which actually was a radio hit, is one of their most soulful ever.  They tap into R&B and Soul, with such lyrics as \\"I'm gonna find you out.\\"  <br />Leave Me to Bleed is another non-single that tops them all, a great song to listen to if you've ever been jilted by somebody. <BR>Sometimes was another radio hit- did any other synth-pop group use a saxophone melody like that?  The Circus, while not an obvious choice for a single, is a stroke of genius, in how it mixes a \\"carnival\\" sound with such grave lyrics about the disenfranchisement of the working man.  The album \\"proper\\" ends with Spiralling, which for my tastes could have been left off altogether, though it has its fans.  <br />The bonus tracks, sadly, are all duds.  In the Hall of the Mountain King is just Vince Clarke's electro-reworking of a classical tune.  And the remixes of Sometimes and It Doesn't Have to Be are nothing special, just your standard 80's \\"extended\\" mix, which doesn't reveal any new facet of the song, or make it danceable.  It doesn't matter, though, because the album itself is so strong.<br />If you think that Erasure's glory days begin with The Innocents, Wild!, or Chorus, think again.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Awww, man, the only thing that sucks about this movie is that is failed to attract my attention back in the late 80's! I wish I had seen it back then, because by now it would not only be a great fun movie, but also have that additional nostalgic factor to it. But regardless, there's still enough 80's atmosphere and cheese to daze my brain. That and the movie is actually pretty good. I'm a huge fan of movies that take place in one day/night. This movie takes place all in one night, is all shot during the night hours, so there's none of that pesky mood-killing daylight to worry about. I may have missed this back in the 80's, but at least they have it on DVD now, and it looks great. I just finished watching it the second time. Also, the commentary by the Chiodo brothers is entertaining and funny. What a miracle it was that the executives okay'ed this movie! Too bad movie producers don't seem to have the guts these days to take shots on such wild ideas. I keep hearing the brothers are going to make a sequel (that would rock!), but the rumor has been spinning for years now. C'mon, we want more Killer Klowns! Come back, Klowns, come back - earth needs you! :)

B00005QDW5|5.0|Frankly this is the only collection by Pink Floyd that attempts to cover the history of the band and does it quite well.  Read on...<br />TO New Comers - Buy these albums first DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, ANIMALS, THE WALL, WISH YOU WERE HERE, PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN, SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS and MEDDLE.  Enjoy these (and other albums) before exploring this collage of music.  You won't be sorry.  I can't imagine listening to this compilation and making any sense of it without thoroughly knowing these songs and the times in which they where written (a stretch of 30 years!) <br />To Old Fans - Stop complaining!  It's impossible to put a collection of Pink Floyd songs together that would please everyone. (i.e. Barret fans vs. Waters fans vs. Gilmour fans).  If you want all the songs from one album then listen to the album!  As for me, I miss `Welcome To The Machine', `Interstellar Overdrive' and `Brain Damage/Eclipse' from the set.  The unfinished song 'Embryo' would be nice too! <br />I think the non-chronological placing of these songs adds something new to the mix and the  transitions between some of these songs create a mosaic of music just as these songs did on their original albums.  My favorite is between `Us And Them' and 'Learning To Fly'.<br />This is definitely not a Greatest Hits, to do that you should just own the albums!
6304005490|5.0|Carol Templeton (Doris Day) is a advertising agent whose company keeps on loosing money to Ramsey and Son Owned by The young Peter Ramsey (Tony Randall) but his worker Jerry Webster (Rock Hudson)is always stealing campaigns and then when He steels the Miller Wax campaign from right under their nose!

If you havn't seen this movie yet I highly suggest to you that you watch it I can guarantee you that you will certainly enjoy it a lot!

6300185311|5.0|Judy Kimball (Doris Day) and George Kimball (Rock Hudson) have finally tied the knot in their 3rd and last film together. George is a major hypochondriac that when he goes to the doctor he hears his doc telling somebody that they are not expected to live much longer but George thinks he is talking about himself and gets all worried well he then tries to get judy another man before he dies and Judy thinks for sure that George is having an affair with a neighbor! Well he then tells her the truth and that ends it until she sees the doctor and the doc tells her the real story well than George admits to her and they are all hapy once again!
B000001Y5X|5.0|There are a few bands that can produce great debut albums, and those that do are the truly talented. Such is Marilyn Manson, the man and the band. Portrait of an American Family is full of hard rock songs that will get you moshing in the comfort of your own home. Songs like \\"Lunchbox\\" and \\"Dope Hat\\" are still going strong as heavy favorites between Manson fans, even after 10 years of musical life. \\"Get Your Gunn\\" is an extremely catchy song composed with a little rap, a lot of guitar, and some good ol' Manson ear-blasting. \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is creepy musically, and lyrically it explores desire, infatuation, and spite -- all mixed into one nifty track. \\"Misery Machine\\" is a parody (sorta) of Scooby Doo's infamous Mystery Machine, and caps off the album nicely -- even though it leaves the listener wanting more (but that, of course, is a good thing).    All in all, this is a great album. Don't let the band's seemingly evil image discourage you; if you're in need of something to rock out to, then this disc is for you.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|This album is one of the best I have ever heard.  When I first started listening to them I thought they were kinda hard but then I was introduced to more and more of the stuff and they stayed my favorite band.

B00000AFGM|5.0|Mechanical Animals is quite the musical experience, with many different types of sound mixed together to produce some guality tunes. There are the usual jam tracks that ACS fans might be familar with, such as \\"Rock Is Dead\\", \\"Posthuman\\", and \\"I Want To Disappear\\"; the pop singles that casual fans might recognize, such as \\"The Dope Show\\" and \\"I Don't Like The Drugs [But The Drugs Like Me]\\"; and then there are the real gems of the album -- the slower, more melodic songs, like \\"Mechanical Animals\\", \\"The Speed of Pain\\", \\"The Last Day On Earth\\", and \\"Coma White\\" (a personal favorite of mine). Each song captures the softer side of Marilyn Manson that'd been previously unheard of, and each one shows off the band's various musical talents. If you're looking for a truly unique album to get lost into, then this is it.
B000002UDB|2.0|This is the one with Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know and a host of other mediocre songs on it.  Pass on this one.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is probably the best Marilyn Manson album in existence, perhaps rivaling with Mechanical Animals. Or perhaps not. Either way, there's absolutely no denying the musical talents of the band (unless you blatantly despise them for their image, but that's another case). AntiChrist Superstar displays the industrial metal side of Manson that had only previously surfaced slightly in Portrait of an American Family. <br /> <br />\\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\\" starts us down the spiraling road to Hell, and refuses to let go. Everybody's heard of \\"The Beautiful People\\". \\"Dried Up, Tied, And Dead To The World\\" is one of the catchier songs on the album, with an excellent 1 minute epilogue. \\"Tourniquet\\" gives us a slight glance at Manson's softer side that dominates his next album, but \\"Little Horn\\" pulls us right back down that road of doom. \\"Cryptorchid\\" is morbid, and by the time \\"Deformography\\" rolls around, you begin to realize that there is no turning back. \\"Wormboy\\" and \\"Mister Superstar\\" basically taunts that fact at you, and you can't help but LIKE it. \\"Angel With The Scabbed Wings\\" is full-fledge hardcore metal, and is somewhat reminiscent of White Zombie's \\"Thunder Kiss '65\\" and \\"More Human Than Human\\". <br /> <br />\\"Kinderfield\\" shows us that there might still be hope, and again reflects the child-like side of the band that we were acquainted with in Portrait of an American Family. Of course, being that this is Marilyn Manson, you get a tap on the shoulder and a reminder that you're not listening to \\"Portrait\\"; you're listening to AntiChrist Superstar. And how appropriate that this reminder comes in the form of the song, \\"AntiChrist Superstar\\"? This track is pure industrial metal, and 100% pure mosh material. \\"1996\\" continues the rampage and Manson, the man, throws all sorts of things that he had deemed unnecessary at your face. \\"Minute of Decay\\" slows us down once more, and as the song plays, you're left pondering who or what Marilyn Manson, the man and the band, really is. Of course, you'd better have your guard up because everytime there's a slow tune, the next one is sure to be pure power. \\"The Reflecting God\\" takes you straight to Hell, brings you back to Earth, then kicks you back down again. This is my absolute favorite song on the album, and one listen will show you why. Manson screams with pure rage at life, death, and beyond with music so awesome that you'll end up screaming with him. <br /> <br />The last song on the album is \\"Man That You Fear\\", and Manson here sounds rather mellow. But that's good, because you're probably exhausted from the last song. In \\"Man That You Fear\\", Manson numbs you down and explains to you the results of this journey, both yours and his -- \\"pray now, baby, pray your life was just a dream...\\" Finally, the album closes off with multiple 3 second loops of silence until it reaches track 99. This hidden track is not a song, but an epilogue of the things that you've experienced, and a prologue of things that are slowly but sure to come. <br /> <br />\\"When all of your wishes are granted, many of your dreams will be destroyed.\\"
B0001CCXZW|5.0|this is the best show on television.  seeing this show go to dvd, i couldnt help but smile.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|This CD was excellent...usually the only good songs (in my experience, at least) are the ones you hear on the radio, and then the rest sound pretty much the same.  Muse, however, is unique in that they experiment with different sounds, successfully combining classical piano with bass guitar.  <br />Muse tones down a bit for songs such as  \\"Sing for Absolution\\" , \\"Falling Away\\" and \\"Endlessly,\\" yet Bellamy still manages to sing his heart out with an emotional intensity that resonates even after they end.<br />Their singles of course are quite catchy, but I believe there are other songs just as good if not better. \\"Apocalypse Please\\" has grown on me to the point where it plays in my head for about half the day. And The first time I heard \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" I thought my stereo had somehow switched to my Rachmaninoff CD in the middle of the song...it was amazing.  <br />About the only fault I find with this CD is lack of particularly powerful lyrics. But Muse more than compensates for this, however, as I believe the music speaks for itself.
0385512104|4.0|This novel is one of the most unusual that I have ever read.  I initially gauged its success by how well emotionally engaged I was by the story.  For the first half, I was gripped . . . but the book tailed off from there.  If I only looked at the book from that perspective, I would grade it a 3.  But the book also contains interesting references to science and math that reminded me of John Paulos's books on how a mathematician looks at the world.  Those parts I rated at a 5.  So the two perspectives came out to a 4.  But if you don't particularly like math or science, this will be an average novel for you before you are done.<br />The premise is simple.  Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is autistic with many emotional complications (including not being able to read others' emotions) . . . and also has a brilliant mind for logic.  Because of his fascinating experiences, his teacher, Siobhan encourages him to write a book . . . which is this one.<br />It's easy to think of Christopher as much younger than he is . . . with problems concerning strangers, others touching him, and wetting himself.  But then the brilliant mind comes out, and you feel like you are in contact with a professor.  The combination is fascinating in the first half of the book as Christopher tries to find out who stuck a pitchfork through the neighbor's dog.  As a twist on The Hound of the Baskervilles, that part of the book is irresistible.<br />Once that mystery is solved, the book seems to veer off into less realistic and less emotionally compelling material.  Christopher's character was no longer completely believable to me.  The writing seemed more like an exercise by an author than Christopher's own as the &quot;author&quot; of this book.<br />I treasured though those parts of the book that help me understand how an autistic person might view the world.  It reminded me of those jumbled letters and reversed numbers on cards that teachers show to simulate what dyslexia is like for those who are not dyslexic.  Such journeys in another's footsteps are rewarding and I encourage you to seek them out.<br />Based on this first novel, I can only hope that we will read more about Christopher in the future.  I suggest, though, that the knife be left behind.e for those who are not dyslexic.  Such journeys in another's footsteps are rewarding and I encourage you to seek them out.<br />Based on this first novel, I can only hope that we will read more about Christopher in the future.  I suggest, though, that the knife be left behind.
1592400876|1.0|Only purchase this book if you aren't particularly well-educated and would like to hear someone similarly ignorant prattle on about something she knows only a little bit about.  Some of her &quot;pet peeves&quot; are actually based on wrong assumptions, but she doesn't understand grammar well enough to know it.  It would be sad if it weren't so irritating.  I much prefer nice people who kind-heartedly, accidentally use bad grammar to this pedantic, stuck-up author pushing her sub-par grammar on scores of innocent readers, shop keepers, and advertisers.
B00006L83N|5.0|As a fan of prog rock and metal I thought I would be stuck listening to Dream Theater, Rush, and Kansas the rest of my life with no other band to turn to. Then Symphony X comes along and wow this band is amazing. The Odyssey holds everything thing good music should have. Blistering guitars and pinpoint precision from every band member. I especially like the vocals and find them to be perfect for each song. And the 24 minute masterpiece The Odyssey is worth the CD price by itself. How many bands can write a song this long and make it good from end to end- not many. 5 Stars and a must buy for progressive music and complex metal music fans.
0679735909|2.0|The theory behind this book is good, but, boy is it DULL.  As another reviewer stated, it does hook you in the beginning, but then continues on with nonsensical poetry and meaningless tales. Once I got to the correspondence between Ash and LaMotte, I didn't know if I could make it through. I finally skipped the whole section, as well as most of Sabine's journal because poking my eyes out seemed like more fun.  However, I'd already invested that much time in the book so I had to finish it. Interesting tale.  Maybe someday it will follow in the footsteps of The Princess Bride and publish the &quot;good parts version.&quot;
B0001Z53CY|5.0|This is one of the best CD's that came out since 2pac and Biggie's CDs. The best eminem and d12 performance yet. Eminem is fantastic on this CD. No eminem no D12.12 tracks are excellent. Not 1 bad song. All they need to make this a perfect CD is to have 50 cent on couple of songs and Gunit maybe in a few. But other than that Great CD.

B0001LJCPC|5.0|That song when Bea is with B.B. at night is called &quot;About Her&quot; by Malcolm McLaren, and is number 12 this album.
140003180X|4.0|&quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men\\" is Alexander McCall Smith's fourth novel in the detective series that began with \\"The Ladies' Number 1 Detective Agency.\\"  In this new installment, the detective cases are not so much crime stories as social and personal situations for private investigator Precious Ramotswe to resolve with her psychological insight and bold maneuvering.<br />The plot component that gives the novel its name concerns the effort of Mma Makutsi, the Agency's skillful office assistant, to found her own business, with unexpected personal consequences.  Another new entrepreneur is not so welcome by the ladies - a flashy and contemptuous outsider who sets up a competing detective agency in Gaborone.  In the novel's most serious subplot, an important client hires Mma Ramotswe to help him redress some wrongs in his past.  The resolution of that case depends upon Mma Ramotswe's wise sense of justice and compassion.<br />In author Smith's charming series, the environment and culture of Botswana, as embodied in Mma Ramotswe and her friends and associates, is as compelling as the mystery.  That is especially true of this volume.  I like these books as much for their portrayal of Mma Ramotswe, for their evocation of Botswana and Africa, for their moral authority and psychological delicacy, for their depictions of community (with its strengths and weaknesses), for their generous humanity and genuine convictions, as for their detection.  These books have heart.  I especially like the narrative voice and prose style, deceptively simple in service of portraying its subjects, and often imbued with poetic lyricism about the landscapes of Africa.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This is where people who know D12's &quot;Devils Night&quot; are gona be expecting nothing less then the fun and talented madness and get it. If you're new to D12 then you have a way to go to get how they work... then you'll discover how varied and obscure they are, never allowing you boredom. You have to know that things change for things to be fresh... So far Eminem has done good to keep his albums jammed with ideas excellent linear motion and development. Alot of the strongest songs are toward the end of his albums, I tend to see that as an awareness that you the listener will not get tired of this album and stop it half way through... you'll instead listen to the whole album...<BR>Experience D12.

B0001HLVSC|5.0|All I can say is wow! After seeing this movie not only did I come away thinking,\\" what a great film this was!\\" but also that i had learned something! This movie teaches you so much about what it would have been like living on a ship, it would not have been pleasent! This film also has awesome action scenes, and great acting(Paul Bettany should have been nominated for an academy award)! Highly recommended! You're missing out if you don't rent it,NOW!<BR>PG-13(intense battle scenes and related images, brief language)<BR>Caution: This movie is way to violent and gory for young children
B0000DD7LB|5.0|&quot;Everytime&quot; is a great ballad!  While she is still not a capable singer, she is not to fault for that.  In the video she does NOT committ suicide.  If anyone pays any attention she is wearing a Kabbalah braclet on her hand... that is NOT blood.  The blood is coming from the back of her head.  She gets hit in the head by a camera toward the beginning of the video but that does not really warrant any bleeding.  But still she does not committ suicide.<br />Regardless:  This CD totally owns!!!  The worst track is probably &quot;Me Against the Music,&quot; and only because Madonna ruins it.  &quot;Toxic,&quot; &quot;Shadow,&quot; &quot;Touch of My Hand,&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot; are all my personal faves on the disc!!  And to respond to the person who said the Divynals &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; was better... no it wasn't, that song was extremely crass!!!  I also enjoyed &quot;Boom Boom.&quot;  But I take back that I say MATM is the worst track, that one would actually be &quot;Brave New Girl!!!&quot;

B000001Y79|2.0|In Tragic Kingdom, No Doubt gets 2.5 stars for being super catchy and having a lot of style.  However, I can't give them any more stars because over-all, this album is very unsatisfying.<br />Yes it this album left me feeling unsatisfied.  I listened to it about four times, trying to figure out why that is.  Here are the reasons as much as I can figure:<br />1.  All the songs are the same tempo, or at least almost the same tempo.  It makes Tragic Kingdom seem very static after a while.<BR>2.  I love Gwen's voice; it has a lot of character.  But her voice sounds the same, no matter what emotion the song is trying to convey.  When she sings about being heartbroken, her voice doesn't show she's heartbroken.  When she sings about fighting her way to the top, her voice sounds the same as when she's heartbroken.  The emotions aren't real; they are part of a performance.  It was like she was lying to me through the whole album.<BR>3.  The lyrics are on the idiotic side.  Not painfully bad (Styx) but not incredible either (Tom Waits).<BR>4.  No Doubt never once puts themselves on the line.  They never go out on a limb or do anything dangerous with their music.  Their sound is good, but accessible and easy to sell.<BR> <BR>This album is good for when you're waking up in the morning and just want something super catchy that doesn't require thought or concentration.   It's definitely not the album for you if you want something thought provoking that will give you the chills.
1402555989|3.0|I really struggled with commenting on this one.<BR>The examples of Aspie traits are brilliantly conveyed: fear of certain colors, following rigid daily routines, hating to be touched, etc.  For the first half of the book, Christopher is quite engaging. Then we come to The Discovery ... downhill from there. I just wasn't buying that knife.<BR>Frankly, I was rather shocked that Christopher was seriously (Aspies don't joke - they say what they mean) considering stabbing a certain person, but realized he wouldn't be able to get what he needed from that person at that time if he did. HELLO? He would be more concerned about being locked up forever (either in a hospital or prison) I'd think; he's terrified of crossing the authorities already over a mere \\"caution\\".  This incident led me to believe that he is a potential danger-to-himself-and-others. Which leads to ... the subway/tube train incident, where he nearly gets himself killed, then starts ranting about cutting off strangers' fingers (which he has mentioned occasionally) because they show concern for him.  I guess I just didn't buy into the premise that he was capable of such violent thoughts, yet had not gotten into more serious trouble than just hitting a classmate and a cop. In the real world, the authorities would never have let someone go who was on the tracks without permission; Christopher would have been taken into custody for it.<BR>On a related note, I was troubled that he seemed quite so paranoid? I chalked that up, at least in part, to the Stranger Danger material with which he is inundated at school. Was that was a joke - along with Christopher's hatred of France?<BR>I had given up caring much about him by the very end. I did muster up enough enthusiasm to find hid dad's choice of gift inappropriate given the color scheme.<BR>Overall, it seemed as though the author was intent on setting up an Aspie protagonist, which he does fairly well (see above re: knife). It was the plot that was the problem.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ok, so maybe the execs don't have a clinical form of attention challenging behavior, but they've got to have some type of devolopmental disability.  Not that I should be throwing stones, but come on guys.  This is one of those situations where the obvious is so... well... obvious.  Here is an incredibly well crafted series that is so glaringly above the floatsom and jetsom of regular network fare, yet it gets axed!<BR>  The whole team on this production just got it plain right.  Cast, spec effects, production, writing.  These artists should be encouraged and well supported.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|Usually, the basis for the romantic comedy is quite simple. We follow one story line of star-crossed lovers through a couple of laughs, and a couple of ups and downs, before their inevitable getting together in the final scene of the film. \\"Love Actually\\" also does this, but on a much grander scale. This movie has every romantic-comedy plotline ever invented: the simpleton just looking for sex, the best friend in love with his best friend's new bride, the cute assistant in love with someone more powerful than her, the sultry secretary trying to sleep with her boss, the married boss trying to keep together a long marriage, the man whose wife slept with his brother and retreats to France for a new frame of mind, the man whose wife has just died, the boy with his first love, the porn stars, the aging rocker. Okay, so all of these stories sound a little bit daunting, but they are put together seamlessly in this phenomenal movie. <br />Based around the month leading up to Christmas, the director takes us through these eight stories, who interconnect, of course. The one thing that is done better here than in many movies of this genre, is that we actually care about all of the stories. Enough is given here that we like all of the characters, whether they are \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\". <br />One thing that is all-too frequently left out of the romantic comedy genre is the comedy aspect of it. \\"Love Actually\\" is full of British wit, and there are a few laugh out loud scenes here. For those who enjoy the dryness of British humour, this is for you. If you laughed at \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", you will laugh at this. <br />What makes this such a good romantic comedy is that there are so many stories, and so much offered to the viewer that they cannot leave dissapointed. This is a movie that will make you smile, because it is so heartfelt, despite the obvious cheesiness and mellowdrama. This is one of those films that can briefly restore your faith in love and humanity, because everything init is so wholesomely good and pure. <br />If you are a fan of romantic comedy, this movie is the ultimate. It conquers all of its rivals over the past few years, and handily at that. A dozen strong performances and a witty script help this tale along, making it difficult to dislike this movie.
B000148KK2|5.0|Hard to believe after listening to this outstanding album that a few years ago Diana Krall was tweaking the 1940s-vintage Nat King Cole trio formula, sounding more often than not like a breath of fresh air inside a traditionalist retro-jazz mode.  After several similiar albums Diana showed she was willing to break out of her musical comfort zone with the orchestrated bossa-driven THE LOOK OF LOVE.  Yet that out-of-the-box experience hardly prepared us for THE GIRL IN THE OTHER ROOM, which for the most part offers all-new material, much of it composed by Diana Krall herself (often in collaboration with her brilliant spouse Elvis Costello).  It's only a little exaggeration to say she's gone from the Y1K to the Y2K great American songbook.  <br />The LOOK orchestrations are gone, the small jazz combo format is back but with drums included full-time.  Overall the sound retains the attractive jazz elements of her past (swing, improvisations), but at times takes a tougher, bluesier stance.  Diana's voice takes the lead in this area, sounding slightly worn but in a good, emotively-compelling manner that matches the depths of the excellent compositions.  Speaking of the sophisticated tunes, without exception they manage to twist melodies and lyrics in fresh directions.  Amazingly, the sum total of this disc bends the rules without breaking the spirit of Diana's best past efforts, managing to be instantly attractive yet certain to reward repeated listens no doubt for years to come.  <br />The album mixes mid-tempo tunes with elegant ballads, no less bold and artistically successful as recent eclectic CDs by the likes of Cassandra Wilson.  Furthermore, as much as I loved all of Miles Davis' transitions throughout his career, I admit that he tended to lose fans along his journey.  But at this point, I'd say that Diana's managed to evolve in a manner that will keep her long-time fans on board while adding new ones.  In fact, speaking of Miles I was thinking this may be Diana'sKIND OF BLUE (relatively speaking).  Overall, THE GIRL... shows off Diana Krall completing the transition from exquisite interpreter to an artist with an original, timeless vision of her own.  Now, if anyone has a different opinion and can offer constructive criticism as opposed to a string of insults, I'd be interested in reading it.
B0001Z53CY|4.0|After resting for three years as a group, D12 represents once again as they continue to expand their skills.  Although not as good as Devil's Night, which connects with the listener immediately and provides more gangsta rap, D12 World is extrememly good after carefully listening to its lyrics.  Eminem continues to show that he is the best rapper out there, hands down.  His creativity in his lyrics leave you in awe as he twists words in \\"Bitch,\\" but his usual flowing talent comes out in \\"6 In The Morning.\\" The songs that Shady does not appear in allow Swift and Proof to display thier skills as well.  Bizarre has his moments as usual but improves as a lyricist in this album.  Combining the talent of producing and rapping by  Eminem, and the individual styles of the rest of D12, this group shows that they can still keep ears listening, even if you don't like D12. Shady Records well done.<BR>Favorite Songs: 6 In The Morning, How Come, Bitch
B00003CXPD|4.0|This was a good film with good production quality. The acting was solid and heart felt. The story was tender, heroic, affirming and at times very funny. Since the story line is outlined in the other reviews, I'll not be redundant. The fact is that I enjoyed the film on it's many levels and feel that it is a sound investment. The images of the young man fighting for the freedom to be and do what it is his nature to, was exceptional and inspired. The courage that this eleven year old shows in the film is splendid and this film is good not only for the skill of acting but for the heart warming feeling that it inspires. It is true that the basis of the story has been done before in many other ways however it can be important to see it from other perspectives as this did. A good investment.
B0001OGVQ2|3.0|I just bought the video version yesterday and I will warn you that if you want the full card, get the DVD because the VHS only has the main marquee matches but no interviews, no video build up prior the event and no extras!<br />Now, those that are saying that his one was the best ought to rethink that.  While it didn't totally suck, it fell far from expectations Here is the review of the matches that are on the VHS version:<br />John Cena Vs. The Big Show - Alright opener. Cena isn't big like Brock Lesner but seeing him pick up 500lbs. for the F.U. is very impressive! I'd give this match 5/10.<br />Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - Surprisingly entertaining. While I do respect Y2J, I haven't thought of Christian since his tag team with Edge ended in 2001 but he could be a big star. I think having Trish Stratus with him does help him because while having her with Jericho would've made for a romantic angle, they are both pretty big stars and far ahead of Christian (Jericho being a former WWF/WWE Undisputed Champ while Trish is a multi-time Women's Champ). I was upset at first but the more I thought about it, having Trish with Christian instead may give him the boost he needs. 8/10 for the match and the surprise heel turn of Trish.<br />The Rock n Sock Connection Vs. Evolution - Nice to see Flair back in. Not a big \\"Nature Boy\\" mark but I am amazed the man can still get in the ring and perform at all. Another match that I was upset about at first but when I think about it, I think having Evolution win was the right call. Still, I would've went with a screwjob ending rather than a clean one since Evolution are supposed to be heels. Nice to see that The Rock has not let Hollywood life make him fat as he looked tremendous! 6/10 for the match.<br />Sable/Torrie Wilson Vs. Stacy Keibler/Miss Jackie - Total waste of time in my view. Just a T & A filler though it does show some potential from Stacy as more than just a model but as a wrestler. Same can be said for Torrie too. 3/10 for the match.<br />Brock Lesner Vs. Goldberg w/\\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin as the ref - WORST MATCH ON THE CARD! These guys didn't do jack! This should've been the best match because both men can do tremendous things, especially Lesner but they did almost nothing! If it wasn't for Austin, this match would've totally blew! I am giving it 2/10 only because of Austin because if it wasn't for him, it would've got 0/10!<br />Eddie Gurrerro Vs. Kurt Angle (WWE Title Match) - Surprisingly even! While I do like Eddie Gurrerro, I've seen how tough Kurt Angle can be even against mat guys like Brock Lesner so I'd figure Kurt Angle would dominate but it was amazingly back and forth! Dirty but nice trick at the end by Gurrerro as he used a loose boot to wiggle out of Kurt's anklelock to get a small package to win the match and retain! 7/10 for the match, especially the creative ending!<br />The Undertaker Vs. Kane - The version shown here is more like \\"The American Deadman\\" rather than \\"The Deadman.\\" Still, it was clearly the \\"Dark\\" Undertaker in his manerisms. Not a great match but the entrances of both UT and Kane make it worth watching. Nice to see Paul Bearer back too! 5/10 for the match.<BR>SIDENOTE:  UT was in fantastic shape! The best I've seen him ever! He even looked in better shape than Kane (who is usually in better conditioned of the two).<br />Chris Benoit Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. Triple H (World Heavyweight Title Triple Threat Match) - While I would've rathered have seen Benoit Vs. HHH one on one like it was SUPPOSED to have been, I can't knock the match itself. It was great! I also have to give HHH props for once and doing the right thing by jobbbing to Benoit rather than him beating Michaels, which I feared would happen. Touching ending at the end of this bout too. I won't give it away but it is heartwarming. I give this match 9/10 and the main reason to get this card!<br />Overall rating: 6/10. Wasn't a great WrestleMania but I have to say that the Triple ThreatMatch plus Gurrerro/Angle as well as Jericho/Christian with the surprise heel turn of Trish saved WM for totally going down the toilet!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|The wonderful imagination of Tim Burton strikes again here, in his father and son story of \\"Big Fish\\". This movie is the incredible life of Edward Bloom, a grand storyteller whose life has remained a mystery because nobody can seperate the fact from the fiction. <br />Will Bloom is called back from Paris because his father is deathly ill. He brings his pregnant wife Josephine with him, and he will speak with his father in the first time in years. Will's problem with his dad stem from his father always stealing the show at the most important moments of his life, and the fact that he never knew who his father really was, because all he was ever told were elaborate tales of giants and witches and mysterious cities in the middle of nowhere. The goal of Will, played excellently by Billy Crudup (one of the most underrated actors out there, see \\"Almost Famous\\" and \\"Jesus' Son\\") is to sort out who is father really is. <br />The father is played by Albert Finney, and Ewan McGregor when he is younger. Both actors take the tall tales and run with them, and both of them come away with very strong performances. <br />\\"Big Fish\\" is the story of leading a huge life, even when it may have been duller than expected. It is the story of a man coming to terms with who his father was, or wasn't, and about the innocence of children dissapearing when the stories of their parents grow old and tiresome. There are so many layers to this movie, each one could be dissected for hours. <br />The direction here is top-notch, as Burton stuns again with his creative vision. This movie allows him to direct straight-ahead drama, as well as the incredible tales of Edward Bloom, which are visually stunning as well as compelling. All the actors here are good, including Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Danny DeVito and Steve Buschemi. <br />\\"Big Fish\\" is a sad story, the story of a man and his son who stopped believing in him, and it is also a story filled with imagination and grandeur that only Tim Burtoncould bring to the screen.

B000002H97|5.0|Like many of you out there, I was immencely shocked after my 1st listen of this, at that time, latest Metallica album. They were thrash metal icons before that, but decided to change a lot of aspects of their music. Was that all for bad? Let's try to analyse.<BR>First of all, the music became lighter, no longer no-compromise-thrash like it used to be. I think, it doesn't necessarily mean &quot;bad music&quot;, isn't it?<BR>Gone are the long 6-8 minute complex songs. All the tracks on the black album are about 4 minutes long. Very radio-friendly, I'd say. And I find that the band, heading for public accessibility, lost some of its progressive touches. I preferred Metallica's complexity.<BR>Riffing style has changed, too. The riffing is more rhythmical now, staccato. It's not bad, it's an entirely another style of writing a heavy metal song.<BR>Vocals improved, no doubt.<br />All in all, while the commercial orientation of this self-titled effort is evident, the record is one of Metallica's strongest. Maybe because they managed to keep their songwriting sharp and mostly &quot;to the point&quot;, while staying heavy. I won't do a song-by-song analysis here. Only mention that &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; will forever be in the Top-3 of my personal Lamest Ballads Ever list. If only they made it 1 minute long and never repeated the same 4 lines till you're sick of them... On the other hand, the ballad &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is very strong. This, and my personal favorite, &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; borrow a lot from another band's classic track - &quot;Sanitarium (Welcome Home)&quot;. Among other strong songs I'd name &quot;God That Failed&quot;, and &quot;My Friend of Misery&quot;. The other songs are more generic, though not bad either. &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; has gotten way too much worldwide airplay to ever be played in my house again, but it's also a good one.<br />To sum this up, if your soul won't protest to the statement that commercial metal can actually be a good thing, then you'll like this album. But for those of you, fans of &quot;true meaner metal music&quot;, I'd advise to finish your Metallica collection with &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;.

B0001907DA|3.0|These movies are childhood favorites. I was disappointed when Police Academy on DVD was fullscreen. So I was excited when the 7 movies were slated for widescreen DVD release. To my horror I found out after I bought them that 4 and 5 are fullscreen. Shouldn't this be a matching set. I have a widescreen TV and having two of the movies in this set in fullscreen is intollerable. I would like to find the person who made that decision and give him or her a battery acid enema. All I can say is that Warner Brothers had better rerelease those two in a widescreen format.
0452284392|3.0|Albert Barabasi presents the lay reader with a stimulating description of the origins of network theory and recent applications. He describes random networks, small world and scalefree networks. In nonrandom networks the importance of hubs is emphasized. Small world networks are the ones with a well defined averge number of links, and in scalefree ones the density of links scales as a power law. For the many interesting examples discussed, I would like to have seen graphs showing scaling over at least three decades in order to be convinced of scaling. However, in practice, whether a network scales or not may not be so important. I liked best the discussions of terrorism, AIDS, and biology. If one could locate the hubs, then a small world network could be destroyed, but as the author points out there is no systematic method for locating the hubs. Also, destroyed hubs in a terror network might be replaced rather fast, whereas airline hubs could not be replaced so quickly. The book might be seen as indicating a starting point to try to develop a branch of mathematical sociology. For example, the maintainance of ethnic identity outside the Heimat is discussed in terms of networking. Now for a little criticism.<br />I did not find the discussion of the rich get richer` very helpful because network theory at this stage deals only with static geometry, not with empirically-based dynamics. In fact, the dynamics of financial markets have been described empirically accurately without using any notion of networking. In the text the phrase economic stability&quot; is used but stability is a dynamic idea, and there is no known empirical evidence from the analysis of real markets for any kind of stability. The absence of dynamics on networks means that complexity is not described at all: there is nothing complex about the geometry of a static network! Suggesting that cell biology can be described by networking is empty so long as dynamics are not deduced from empirics. Nonempirical models of dynamics will probably not be of much use for making advances in understanding or treating cancer, e.g. Everything we know about cell biology and cancer was discovered via reductionism, by isolating cause and effect the way that a good auto mechanic does in order to repair a car.<br />Unfortunately, the author lets his enthusiasm get the best of him when he proclaims laws of self-organization&quot; and the need to go beyond reductionism. First, there are no known laws of self-organization&quot;. The only known laws of nature are the laws of physics and consequences deduced from the laws, namely, chemistry and cell biology. Worse, every mathematical model that can be written down is a form of reductionism. Quantum theory reduces phenomena to (explains phenomena via) atoms and molecules. All of chemistry is about that. Cell biology attempts to reduce observed phenomena to DNA, proteins, and cells. Believers in self-organized criticality try to reduce the important features of nature to the equivalent of sandpiles. Network enthusiasts hope to reduce phenomena to nodes and links. In order to try to isolate cause and effect, there is no escape from reductionism of one form or another, holism being an empty illusion. So I did not at all like the assertion on pg. 200 that globalization (via deregulation and privatization) is inevitable, because there is no law that tells us that it is.<br />Summarizng: there is no complexity without dynamics, there are no known laws of self-organization&quot;, and reductionism is the only hope for doing science. Anyone who disagrees with this is welcome to explain to me and others the alternative (jmccauley@uh.edu).ical models of dynamics will probably not be of much use for making advances in understanding or treating cancer, e.g. Everything we know about cell biology and cancer was discovered via reductionism, by isolating cause and effect the way that a good auto mechanic does in order to repair a car.<br />Unfortunately, the author lets his enthusiasm get the best of him when he proclaims laws of self-organization&quot; and the need to go beyond reductionism.

B0001Z53AQ|4.0|I thought this album is sick.  Im a big fan of eminem and the shady/aftermath crew.  This isnt up to the standards of an Em solo efforts but its still real tight.  I agree that Em's production skills are sick he makes beats that seem to adapt to his rhyme style and it hurt the rest of the group who cant spit like Em.  Proof is the best member other than Em and the track produced by Kanye is a big thumbs up. My favorite tracks are How Come and The Good Die Young.  My question is who in How Come about?  The name that comes to my mind is Royce da 5'9 since he had a little fallin out wit Em's camp. Anybody got any thoughts?

B0000BWVCM|5.0|Being someone who has been turned off by the whole concept of sequels, I however was ready to see &quot;X-Men United&quot; in a heartbeat considering how good the first one was. Luck has it that this in fact surpasses the first one and ranks as one of my favorite sequels of all time. <br /> Professor Charles Xavier and his former friend and now enemy Magneto parted ways long long ago on their beliefs about the 'normal' humans treatment of mutants. The mutant world divided into the X-Men and the anti-human organizations lead by Magneto and Mystique. These two worlds in the mutant societies clash over the issue of humans and mutants living together. However ALL mutants' lives are in jeopardy when a vicious rogue general named William Stryker organizes a violent militant anti-mutant organization to track down and kill every mutant on Earth and launches an assault on Xavier's School for The Gifted. <br /> Now the mutants from both sides and that includes Xavier and his nemesis will have to put aside their differences and unite under one banner to defeat the threat that is William Stryker. <br /> This movie really does the trick of surpassing the original. Hugh Jackman delves even deeper into his role as Wolverine and this movie sheds more light on Wolverine's past involving his days as a victim of numerous experiments. <br /> THis movie is also a very scary example of the dangers of discrimination should it be left unchecked or even encouraged such as what happened in World War II. <br /> The DVD edition also has a lot of cool 'behind the scenes' extras along with some deleted scenes that never made it on the film include one of Jubilee who isn't in the movie itself. <br /> Go and buy this DVD when time and money allow it!
B000148KK2|2.0|Some CDs you love instantly, others have to grow on you.  After my first listen I thought this was one of the latter but after my third listen I'm beginning to doubt it.  'Girl in the Other Room' is largely a collection of ballads that are, as another reviewer put it, tedious.  The voice is as sultry as ever and, as usual, Krall does nicely interpreting works of others like the opening track 'Stop this World.'  But sorely missing are the straight ahead, uptempo numbers featuring Msrs. Clayton &amp; Hamilton as well as Diana's solos, which I always felt were underappreciated.  I've enjoyed her experimentation with different styles and arrangements in the past but this CD will not occupy a permanent place in my collection.

B00005JMEW|5.0|This film is simply amazing.  From the opening scene to the final revelation, this movie is one of my favorite of all time.  I originally saw it in the theaters and loved it.  Since I bought the DVD I have watched it at least 15 times.  Film making at its best here folks.  I hope Tarantino puts both volumes together as one movie as a special edition in the near future.  One more thing.  I saw a review comparing this to The Passion.  Let me just say, that both films are completely different and comparing the two is like comparing a Da Vinci to a log in the toilet.  Kill Bill is a work of pure genius while The Passion is a work of religious masochism.  If you want to be guilted back to church, go see The Passion.  If you want to be entertained and blown away by a master of film making at his best, buy this DVD.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|With films like Edward Scissorhands, A Nightmare Before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow under his belt, it seems that my favorite director, Tim Burton, can do no wrong when it comes to imaginative storytelling. I hardly ever get a chance to go to the movies so I've been wanting to rent this for the longest time now but the wait was well worth it. I've always enjoyed weird, quirky films that are slightly off the beaten path and &quot;Big Fish&quot; is definitely one of those films.<br />Based on the novel by Daniel Wallace, this movie is pretty much about a son trying to understand his dying father whom he never really knew while incorporating elements of tall tales and myths through flashbacks of the eccentric adventures his father, Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor when he was a young man) told him growing up, such as his brave encounter with a witch who has a glass eye that foretells the way one will eventually die if they dare stare into it (and that's simply the tip of the iceberg, so to speak). Finding it hard to believe the fables his father tells to be true he sets out to unravel the truth by visiting Jennifer Hill (played by Helena Bonham Carter) after finding a deed to a town he'd thought to be make-believe called Spector. &quot;Big Fish&quot;, however, is not as it appears. It is every bit a drama as it is a fantasy. It may not be my favorite Tim Burton film but it's uniquely different yet similar in feel to the other projects he's worked on, and that's probably because it's unlike anything in the theaters for Tim Burton is known to take risks by straying far from the usual. He's a visionary and a dreamer and &quot;Big Fish&quot; is a charming, delightful journey not to be missed...<br />Hope this review wasn't too brief but I don't wish to explain what happens in too much detail. You must discover this gem for yourself, not really knowing what to expect.
0451167716|4.0|I've never seen the godfather films just know roughly what it was so I was greatly impressed with the complexity of this book and the feeling that Puzo puts into his characters. My biggest problem with this book is that I feel that it wasn't a closed chapter and it left me wanting more. I know that the family could technically carry on forever but the ending that he gave it is a little too fairytail for me. but overall a hugely entertaining read and a new favorite of mine.
B000005RTR|3.0|Of course Coverdale's vocals smoke... and the version of 'Fool For Your Loving' included here is my favorite.  'Ain't No Love In the Heart of the City' is an awesom cross between melancholy blues and metal.  But 3 songs from the 11/23/78 Hammersmith show are not on this CD.  Go for the CD with 13 tracks.  It still leaves off one version of 'Come On' that was on the original double lp set (and the strongest version, at that) but it is more complete than this one.<br />  I'm waiting for the double CD reissue with bonus tracks- hint hint!!!<br /><br />March 20, 2007 UPDATE!<br />The 2 CD version is out.  No bonus tracks, but at least all of the original tracks.  My favorite Whitesnake release ever!
B00005JMFQ|1.0|This is the most stupid movie I have ever seen.<br />This movie is superficial, shallow, and pretentious.<br />It started with \\"There is a lot of love.  Look at the airport scene\\".  Stupid.  Of course the airport is full of a lot of love.  If you don't love the person, you won't go through all the trouble to pick the person up at the airport in the first place.<br />It also started with \\"Look at Sept 11.  On the airplane, people just call to say I love you.  There was no phone call for hatred or revenge.\\"  Of course not, stupid.  It is considered a waste of time to them.  They don't have hatred or revenge?  Of course they do.  Just look at all the day to day evilness of people.  All the self-interest and cold bloodedness.  The director picks two particular moment and want to make you think that human world is full of love.  What a crock.<br />It also glorifies infatuation.  Many of the so-called \\"love\\" in this movie is just crush or infatuation, or love-at-first-sight.  If you are a teenager, that feeling maybe great.  But if you are more mature, you know infatuation is a dangereous thing.  It is not necessarily true love, and it makes you  obsessed.  Why does this movie make infatuation look so \\"great\\"?
B00007AJF9|1.0|This movie tells the story of young Elizabeth Tudor, well, at least a girl bearing her name and dressing up in costumes. The movie is filled with errors, flaws and lies. Just the costumes alone are wrong btw. They're not from 1558, actually we see costumes from the 17th century here. A horrible mish mash, Elizabeth never wore gowns like this, the only right one is the last one. Then the \\"palaces\\" which are not Elizabethan but old CHURCHES! The story itself is so changed that anyone who knows Elizabeth Tudor's true story must be appalled. True, \\"Young Bess\\" also altered the young Queen's story but they didn't present a trashy, tacky, sex- and blood-ridden \\"thriller\\" that never took place like this. Elizabeth's true story was exciting enough. Buy \\"Elizabeth R.\\" with Glenda Jackson instead, she portrays the cunning, ruthless and complex Elizabeth we know from history, not a weeping, silly cry-baby.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Like someone says, grossly overlooked......just like EROTICA (one of my fave M albums) <br />Love every track on it....although I'm so stupid sucks a little. <br />The remixes were amazing as well - the unreleased ones especially <br />Hollywood - Deepsy and Hollywood express mixes.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|I came to M&C as a die-hard O'Brian fan - all 20 books, multiple audio editions, etc. - very excited to see the story on-screen, but wondering how Weir could do them justice.  In contrast to two recent favorite blockbuster-books-to-movies, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, both of which are filled with action and visual imagery, the Aubrey-Maturin books are mostly interior: Aubrey muses on the wind, weather, tide, or enemy strategy, and Maturin on the politics of Catalonia, the classification of birds, or the psychology of seamen - all with a wealth of impressively-researched detail, and in a style close to Jane Austen.  The screenwriters managed to render as much of the story in action as possible, a change really required by the medium, and to do so handsomely.<BR>    The balance of characters, however, was a catastrophe.  The books are called \\"the Aubrey-Maturin series\\" because they revolve around the double-star of these two characters, whose strengths and failings interlock like yin and yang.  Maturin is, if anything, the more fully-realized, being closer to the author's own personality and voice.  In reshaping the story as a (single) star vehicle for Russell Crowe, Aubrey's more humanizing foibles were cast adrift. For example, in the book, Aubrey shares the anecdote of Nelson asking him to \\"pass the salt\\" with blatant hero-worship untouched by any trace of irony; in the film, he is sardonic & self-mocking, \\"in on the joke\\" in a way that naturally belongs to Maturin, not himself.<BR>    The problem is compounded by the unfortunate casting of Paul Bettany as Maturin.  He is a fine actor, but far too suave, handsome, and socially poised for the role, which wants a strong personality and an actor willing to be unattractive (...).  The fact that Crowe and Bettany got along well on an earlier project may have made for smoother filming, but a clash of more-equally-sized personalities might have made a stronger movie.
B000002UUH|5.0|At the time of this writing some 120 used copies of this album were up for sale here in Amazon for as little as $0.99. Why would anyone on his/her right mind get rid of this fabulous collection, I can only speculate about, because simply put, this compilation of John Lennon music has every single by the musical genius from Liverpool that became a hit in his lifespan (and even after his death).<br />To this day, almost 25 years after his murder, all his music seems ageless. It sounds as fresh as ever, and it still makes me sad: to realize such a talent was lost... When I listen to songs such as \\"Love\\", \\"Woman\\" (the first song I have an actual memory of having listened to over and over on the radio) and \\"Beautiful Boy\\" (a song I love to dedicate to my own son), I feel torn between the void that he left, and the joy and peace his songs bring to my heart as well.
B00008S2VG|5.0|incredible ballads, impressive dance anthems, poetry, catchy songs, touchy lyrics, beauty and fun.<br />guess i´ll die another day!!!
B0001LJCPC|5.0|This is for those of you looking for the song playing in the Kill Bill Vol. 2 Trailers:<BR>The Japanes trailer and bootleg trailer--&gt; Sunny Road to Salina by Bernard Gerard-Cristophe<br />The full trailer--&gt; The Trio by Ennio Morricone (from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly- plays at the climax of the film in the cemetery)<br />As for the rest of the songs missing, I am lost. Does anyone have a list of the entire music list from Kill Bill Vol. 2.<BR>Thanks, <BR>SMG in KY
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice is one of the greatest song writters of our time.  This album has won a constant spot in my CD changer.  The melody and heart he pours into each song make it so much more then background music.<br />I would reccomend this album to anyone who has been impressed with the lyrics of Jude.
B000002KKS|5.0|After charismatic, but drug-addicted, John &quot;Ozzy&quot; Osbourne left the band for good in late 1978, Black Sabbath still had many fans, but they were basically considered to be washed-up. After all, Heavy Metal was an early '70's thing, and disco now ruled the airwaves in the latter part of the decade. This was the position in which the remaining members (guitarist Tony Iommi, bass guitarist Tony &quot;Geezer&quot; Butler and drummer Bill Ward) found themselves when searching for a new lead singer. They found Ronnie James Dio, an American who had been the lead singer for New York-based blues-rock band Elf from 1972-75, and then for British-based progressive Heavy Metal band Rainbow from 1975-78. Many people wondered skeptically if Black Sabbath could recreate their old magic with Dio as their lead singer.<br />Well, they didn't; instead, they made some new magic. Hooking up with Rainbow's producer, the great Martin Birch, they were clearly re-energized when they recorded HEAVEN AND HELL in early 1980, both musically and lyrically. Ronnie James Dio, who had written Rainbow's famous mystical lyrics to such classics as &quot;Man On The Silver Mountain&quot; and &quot;Stargazer,&quot; found a new home in Black Sabbath, as he was easily able to incorporate his mystical lyrics into Sabbath's style.  Opening with the fast, blazing &quot;Neon Knights,&quot; HEAVEN AND HELL shows Black Sabbath ready for the 80's. Tony Iommi's guitar riffing is faster, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward's rhythmic interplay is tighter, and Dio's singing is incredibly inspired. This was a Black Sabbath that was louder, faster, clearer and more progressive-oriented. This progressive orientation is even more evident on the album's second track, &quot;Children Of The Sea.&quot; Beginning with soft guitar and singing, Black Sabbath quickly whip the music up into a fierce mid-tempo riff over which Dio sings:<br />&quot;We sailed across the air before we learned to fly;<BR>We thought that it could never end.<BR>We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run. Run!<BR>Now it seems our world has come undone.&quot;<br />&quot;Children Of The Sea&quot; incorporates some gothic-sounding background vocals which combines the third dimension of finesse with Tony Iommi's technically proficient lead guitar playing. It's an incredible song. &quot;Lady Evil&quot; begins with a strong mid-tempo bass/drum groove with enticing lyrics that talk about &quot;a magical mystical woman&quot; who lives &quot;In a place just south of Witches' Valley&quot; and features another inspired lead guitar solo from Tony Iommi. Then, another instant Black Sabbath classic is born with the title track, which features one of the best and most recognizable opening guitar riffs, some of the best bass playing and drumming, and one of the most incredibly fierce vocal performances singing some of the most poetic lyrics:<br />&quot;Sing me a song, you're a singer.<BR>Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil.<BR>The Devil is never a maker.<BR>The less that you give, you're a taker.<BR>So it's on and on and on, it's Heaven and Hell,<BR>Oh well&quot;<br />Black Sabbath just redefined their music for a whole new generation of Metal fans with this album! The nearly seven-minute &quot;Heaven And Hell&quot; ends with a full minute of beautiful Spanish-guitar playing by Tony Iommi, which he had not done since &quot;Symptom Of The Universe&quot; from the 1975 album SABOTAGE. &quot;Wishing Well&quot; is a fast hard-rocker that reminds us that &quot;Time is a never ending journey/Love is a never ending smile.&quot; Black Sabbath then go for the jugular again with the multi-part &quot;Die Young,&quot; which deceptively begins with a spacey keyboard intro which is joined by high-pitched guitar, then transformed into a fast, muscular feast of Metal, in which Dio sings with an emotional ferocity: <br />&quot;Gather the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all<BR>Your back's to the wall<BR>Chain the sun, andit tears away (and it breaks) you as you run, you run, you run.&quot;<br />Then, everything gets quiet and Dio sings softly: <br />&quot;Die young, die young;<BR>Can't you see the writing in the end?<BR>Die young, gonna die young<BR>Someone stopped the fall.&quot;<br />Then the heavy guitar comes roaring back again. All of this goes on comfortably inside of five minutes! &quot;Walk Away&quot; is a mid-tempo tune that can be described as a mystical anti-love song. The song is not among the album's most memorable (even so, it still beats most of the material on NEVER SAY DIE!), but it's still very solid and rhythmic. Then the feeling of loneliness is explored in the album's final song, the slow-paced but powerful &quot;Lonely is The Word.&quot; <br />At 39:50, HEAVEN AND HELL is a full six minutes shorter than the band's final outing with Ozzy, which was overlong and under-produced, and as a result is snappier and packs a much greater punch. There are no weak songs here. This album totally revitalized Black Sabbath and opened them up to a new generation of fans. HEAVEN AND HELL sold over a million copies in the U.S. alone (which Sabbath had not done in at least five years) and made the Billboard Top 20 for several weeks in 1980. Black Sabbath embarked on a highly successful arena-sized concert tour that year, and immediately spurred on the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal (joined by re-energized veterans such as Judas Priest, and by newcomers as diverse as Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Saxon and Motorhead). To this day, this remains one of Black Sabbath's greatest albums ever (see its position on my Listmania list), and is a must-buy for any fan of their music.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED
B00008ADPF|4.0|I don't care what anyone else has to say about this album because it is the most solid effort yet from the band.  You won't hit the skip button too much, which is the mark of a good CD. Nickelback gives you what you liked in Silver Side Up(crisp guitar riffs, catchy coruses, social commentary, angst, etc.) and then some.  This is solid hard rock in the vein of 3 Doors Down, Saliva and Ra,  not harsh rock(i.e. Korn, System of a Down, etc.)  Standout songs include Believe it or Not, Throw Yourself Away(with a disturbing topic ripped from recent headlines) and the first single Someday.  If you're a fan of hard rock then The Long Road is well worth owning.
B000066NW0|5.0|Although Avril Lavigne claims that she isn't trying to be a  rock artist, people label her music as 'pop', which really bothers me, and even though this album was her first, the music never gets old. Sure, she isn't a complete rock artist, she's more in the 'punk' music category, along with artists like Good Charlotte, Sum 41 and Simple Plan. FeFe Dobson even claims that if it weren't for people like Avril, it would have been much harder for her as an artist. So I admit avril isn't a rock artist, no one ever said she was, but she's still got a great voice with a lot of talent, and if you've ever been to one of her concerts or have heard an acoustic song of hers, she sounds amazing. So if your as foolish as not to get this ablum, because of her image, it's your loss, because this album is great!!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Coming from someone who bought a DVD player just so he could buy the Matrix DVD many years ago, this movie was far departure from the first Matrix.  With this installment, it seems the W. Bros became all too wrapped up in their world of Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and forgot where the Matrix came from.  The Matrix was born from both the inate human desire to understand human origin, and the need for a good summer movie.  It had it all: good story, great special effects, a hot sound track... Matrix Revolutions was born from the need to pack more special effects in than Matrix Reloaded.  And that's what it has: special effects galore.  Even the kung-fu seemed to be recycled.<br />My real gripe, however, is with the rediculous half-baked character interactions.  There are a host of new characters, few of which are really explored in the context of the matrix or the machine world.<br />I give it three stars because it's worth watching... but don't expect to be even remotely as impressed as you were with the first Matrix.
B000002H33|1.0|First off, I'm not going to analyse Masters, as you could write a thesis with the amount of reviews on the website, but I cannot begin to express what impression this album has made on me. Everlasting is perhaps the only word possible. No other album in my collection of 95 ½ (does a half eaten tape count?) has ever come close to the musical perfection on this album. To say this album is a classic is still simply lacking.<br />The album has been one of my few ritual \\"motivator\\" albums used to hype me up, and by the same token I have lied awake and slept many nights with masters being the last thing in my ears.<BR> <BR>It's sad to see the music that Metallica has released in the 90's and of late. Ironically I have still bought every album they have released, hoping for a glimpse of what used to be, or I suppose more accurately what I hope could be. As a fan of the band, it pains me to see them losing what they once had. Without accusing them of selling out (as has been unforgivingly accused by countless others in many other reviews), they lack the fire they once had. Sure, call it maturity, call it evolution, but it would seem the concept of simply playing for the love of music has left them, their productions are less raw, and too tamed - even restrained and for what? <br />I am at a loss for words when comparing the radical St Anger to this masterpiece. St Anger isn't an evolution, it's simply bad music. The talent demonstrated in the entire album is wincingly less that in any one of the songs on this album.<br />The almost undisputed kings of metal during the 80's era have become not so undisputed.<BR>The nu-metal Metallica as much as it disgusts me to say - is unfortunately overshadowed by even the likes of *takes a gulp to get lump out of throat* limp bizkit as their music seems to be heading this way.<br />Let's hope Metallica has had enough playtime pussyfooting around with their shrink (see movie) and remember their true roots as musicians.
B000089CPF|5.0|This album is so different and so diverse it will be like nothing you have ever heard before.  Just when one track mellows you out the next track will take your breath away.  This album should be illegal because it is so addicting.  Calexico is the most innovative band I have heard in a long time.  I turn everyone on to it.
B000006OAM|5.0|The emotion in this CD is what makes it so great.  Her voice is amazing.  The lyrics are nice too.  When I bought this CD I hadn't previously listened to Natalie's music.  It got me hooked, to say the least - I now have every one of her CD's, including the ones from the 10,000 Maniacs days.  This is her best work yet. Motherland came close to meeting this quality, but not quite.  Excellent, excellent CD.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|Those songs the two previous reviewers want are on the soundtrack.  The song when Miramax comes up is Silhouette of Doom and the one while Beatrix and her daughter are watching TV is &quot;About Her&quot;  The One during the credits is Malaguena Salerosa.  These are all on the soundtrack.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I'm sooooooooo impressed by Madonna's sell-out concerts all over America, Canada and Europe. She's still the most relevant female artist of all times and 2004 was a big year for her:<br />- AMERICAN LIFE was released and certified gold and platinum and had a #1 debut on the Billboard Album Charts;<br />- DIE ANOTHER DAY was the best-selling single of both 2003 and 2004;<br />- Madonna did a lot of little concerts in NY, London and Paris to promote the new album and these cities just became crazy because of her concerts;<br />- The singles DIE ANOTHER DAY, AMERICAN LIFE, HOLLYWOOD, NOTHING FAILS/NOBODY KNOWS ME and LOVE PROFUSION were #1 Dance Singles on Billboard;<br />- All of those singles were Top 5 sales singles;<br />- NOTHING FAILS/NOBODY KNOWS ME and DIE ANOTHER DAY were #1 on the Billboard Sales Singles Charts;<br />- Her 2 first children books were #1 sales and became huge best-sellers worldwide;<br />- Now Madonna annonced her re-INVENTION tour with more than 40 sold-outs.<br />- At this moment AMERICAN LIFE the album shipped more than 5 million copies worldwide.<br />Madonna is at one of her best moments. I LOVE this album.
B000092T6M|3.0|This many-layered interpretation of Robin Hood is almost Shakespearean in presentation:  the fern-encrusted merry men are a treasure, as is Little John's wife.  Although Kevin Cosner is miscast as Robin Hood and Little John's performance is rather flat (the two from whom one might have expected the most magnetism), the other performances make this movie so worthwhile and, in a sense, innovative.  Azeem (Morgan Freeman) is a constructive element of expansion of the tale to a broader world-wide perspective (albeit anachronistically trite at times).  Strong and spunky Maid Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is a more real and believable character than in her traditional damsel-in-distress function.  The real gem here, though, is Alan Rickman's and the screenwriter's interpretation of the Sheriff of Nottingham as a tragic-comic villain.  It is worth purchasing the movie just for that.  And you can't miss Sean Connery as the returning King Richard.  This movie is too dark and violent for children (unlike other Robin Hood versions).
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I thought this movie was a great one, but instead I was almost falling sleep and my worst nightmares were better.  There is absolutely no coherence and the dialogues are vague and infertile.  I didn't like it and will not recommend it.
6305949980|5.0|Just when the media thought that quirky director, Tim Burton, couldn't get more imaginative and more different, he did.  This film is unlike any film I have ever seen.  What I find stunning is that the audience finds passion and feeling coming from two characters made of clay.  It is really a feast for the eyes, and even the ears being that it is a musical.  One of Burton's greatest acheivments, this film I feel is more for the adults than it is for the children.  I highly reccomend this film for any Tim Burton fan.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is as good as Mulan Rouge but even better.  The performances on that movie are amazing.  Everyone seems to know what they are doing and enjoy doing it.  Richard, Queen Latifah, Renee and Catherine, and the rest of the cast are wonderful.  This movie is a MUST HAVE.
0792164903|4.0|Once again Tim Burton brings us another gothic fairy tale full of dark corners and mystic characters.  This time around he gives us goth with a touch of class and elegance.  Who better than to use once again but Johnny Depp, and the beautiful Christina Ricchi, as Ichabod Crane and Katrina.  This movie is probably the most scary and edge of your seat Burton film.  It is full of great scares and chills, and it is a wonderful movie to watch on a dark spooky night.  This may have not been Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or even Batman, but it is definately one of Tim Burton's greatest movies.
B000148KK2|3.0|This album is recorded well and my only complaint about the musicians is that Marc Ribot should've been the guitarist.  He was born to play these type of tunes.<br />  The lyrics on this album are very good and even a little raunchy at times...  Especially &quot;Love me like a man.&quot;  Most Krall fans will adore the album - if you're not into Krall - this album won't sell you either.  Ta-ta...
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump, to me, is one of the greatest movies of all time.  You get involved with a simple minded man, and see everything through him.  After seeing this movie, you almost feel like you know Forrest Gump.  You don't even expect the film to move you that much, but it does, and it takes you by complete surprise.  Tom Hanks is one of the greatest American actors, and personally I do not think that any one else could've even come close to playing that role.  All the suporting cast was vibrant and interesting.  The movie all around is a classic that will never be forgotten.
B000059TPN|4.0|The most clever thing about this witty film is the fact that Sean Connery is basically playing James Bond - albeit a James Bond who just spent 30 years in the nastiest federal prisons the US of A has to offer.  If the ludicrous plot, gratuitous destruction and cliched characters aren't a hindrance to you, then you are in for the a treat.  This movie is not only ridiculously action packed, it verges on self-mocking, and has some of the best one-liners ever.  With this dvd edition, The Rock gets the treatment that it deserves.  Buy it and rejoice.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This film is probably in my top five favorite movies of all time.  Everything about this movie is stunning.  It truely deserved every single Award that it won.  The film is inspiring, touching, heartbreaking, and even funny at times.  The film is very period, even right down to the costumes, artwork, and overall look.  The film is alive with music, drama, dazzling special effects, and one stellar cast.  I wish that Kate Winslet would've beat out Helen Hunt for the Academy Award, she did so much of a better job.  The film is completely wonderful in everyway.  I highly reccomend this movie, and I also ponder why it only has received a three and a half star rating.  Oh well, there's no accounting for taste.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|This collection does not have the song, &quot;Shaking The Tree&quot; -- what a shame!!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|HOLLYWOOD IS THE BEST SONG OF THIS ALBUM AND MAYBE THE BEST SONG I HEARD LAST YEAR ON THE RADIO, NOTHING FAILS THE BEST BALLAD, LOVE PROFUSION THE BEST DANCE TRACK, AMERICAN LIFE THE BEST SONG-VIDEO COMBINATION, DIE ANOTHER DAY THE BEST SOUNDTRACK THEME, <br />Madonna is the QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is one of the best cd's I've bought in awhile.  Definately worth checking out...you won't be disappointed!
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life is my 2nd favorite Madonna album (ROL being my favorite album). And no, I don't say it because I want to be a good fan.  I'm not a good fan anyway, I don't buy all of her singles.  <BR>At first I couldn't decide which album is better, AL or Music, but now one year later I know AL is the winner. I still listen to it very often, especially in my car, when I drive to work or just around. I turn the volume really loud, I love the kick popo beats of American Life, Die Another Day, Nobody Knows Me, Love Profusion, Hollywood....it just puts me in a great mood and makes me happy. And I only skip 1 song! Plus the album has the best cover ever IMO!
B000001DU5|5.0|Hey, i love the 80's.  i love the music, and the films.  i also love the bands who are lost in that fold of &quot;old music.&quot;  The vocals are great, the music is eclectic and fun, and i just love it all.  from Seeds to Advice.  its a sure thing, that is sadly out of print.  get this disc if you can.  ENJOY!
B00013F38K|5.0|This show was responsible for getting me interested in eastern philosophy and I must rate it as my favorite show of all time.<br />The question is, When are season 2 &amp; 3 being released?
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Unnecessary remastering (by an amateur). That's all that this is.  And no, I don't wish that George had remastered &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.<br />On one hand Spector is criticized for his original 1970 version (masterpiece) of &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and then Paul is criticized for leaving out the guitar solo that Spector put in.  Yeah, that makes sense.  The one thing that is clear is that John can't hit the high notes on &quot;Across the Universe&quot; on either version.<br />The 1970 version stands as the classic because of the nicely produced version of &quot;Get Back&quot; that is cut short on this version, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; with the great orchestra backing on the original, and &quot;Let It Be&quot;, with the great distorted guitar solo that I guess Paul thought overshadowed his song.
0743243307|1.0|Bought it after reading the hype and proceeded to be extremely disappointed. Just goes to show you that slick marketing by publishers can suck you in.

B0001Z53MY|5.0|It's amazing to think that this Classic Album was produced back in 1973, I Was majorly impressed with the release of the Digitally Remastered CD &amp; then the SACD 5 Channel Release was very impressive, But there has never been a Better sounding Version of this Album than This DVD-Audio. I personally believe that DVD-Audio has a cleaner sound than a corresponding SACD release.<br />AS a Music Guru ( Molly )here in Australia would say &quot;DO Yourself a Favor&quot; and Even If your not a complete Elton Fan like myself GO and buy this release and see what A true CLASSIC Album sounds like now in 2004 in Awesome 5 Channel DVD-Audio sound.
1401300901|5.0|This book is certainally not a Stephen King novel, but it kept my attention so well, I couldn't put it down.  Everyone can relate to at least one of the lead character's feelings, emotions and personal tradgedies.  It made me feel a little better to know that others have felt the same way, and can continue on with their lives.  Fiction boarders on non-fiction in this novel.  Great easy reader!<br />Keep 'em coming Cecelia!
B0000D96NW|4.0|Advertised in many rock and metal magazines as a so-called, &quot;return to form&quot;, I was a bit skeptical having boughten the thoroughly disappointing SUPERCHARGER disc.  However, having released three absolutely stellar albums prior I decied to give the disc a shot.  Needless to say, and I think all true Machinehead fans will agree, that this is in fact a return to form!<br />From the full-on power that the title track, &quot;Imperium&quot; hits you with to the melodicly creepy fade of &quot;Descend the Shades of Night&quot;, the CD is absolutely everything it was advertised to be.  Other standout tracks on the CD, include: &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; , &quot;Days Turn Blue to Grey&quot;, and &quot;All Falls Down&quot;.<br />As impossible as it may be for this band to create a CD better than Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change, this disc is definitely better than The Burning Red. I reserve a five-star rating for true masterpieces and it was hard not to give this album a fifth star. I recommend it to anyone who really loves rock music as this is what it is all about!
B0001LJCPC|5.0|To all those wondering, the song that is played at the end of Kill Bill2 when the characters are shown is on the album.  It is Malaguena Salerosa and is number 14.  Hope this helps.
B00005JMEW|4.0|&quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; is difficult to rate.  The plot can be described in a single sentence, the characterization is almost nil, the violence is graphic and gratuitous, and yet . . . Tarantino delivers a film unlike any other.  The &quot;chapter&quot; divisions between scenes, the interspersed gritty-textured black and white segments, and the superb soundtrack give it an art-house feel while the highly choreographed, over-the-top fight scenes (which comprise at least ninety percent of the movie) recall the classy &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot; as well as a long heritage of martial arts films.  The gore itself is pure horror film, but in the context of Tarantino's carefully set up noir atmosphere, it has a bizarre elegance of its own.<br />The plot?  A former assassin (Uma Thurman) seeks revenge on those who tried to kill her and her unborn baby years before.  In this, the first volume of a film broken in two, the assassin (known both as The Bride and Black Mamba) manages to face only two out of the five on her list.  Nearly two hours to exact revenge on two people and ninety percent of the film is fighting?  You got it.  Okay, there are some (graphic) flashbacks.  And a fifty or so man Tokyo gangster (graphic) diversion.  And some keen visual humor thrown in. But mostly, we see Uma Thurman in sleek, seventies-style garb wield her knives and swords as no other woman in cinema has.<br />It's a shame Tarantino could not part with scenes from the final fight, which seems to last for an eternity, so he could combine both &quot;Kill Bill&quot; films into one.  This one ends so abruptly and with so much unfinished business that it really cannot be considered complete without its second half.  Take the R rating seriously; only mature teens and older should watch this since the violence is glamorized and desensitizes even the adult viewer.  Full of profanity, raw aggression, and blood, this film is definitely not for everyone.<br />I give this film three stars for plot and concept, but five stars for style.  Although as a stand-alone film, it doesn't hold together the way &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; does, the second volume promises to provide the coherence and significance.  Plan to follow-up your viewing with Volume Two.e.<br />I give this film three stars for plot and concept, but five stars for style.

B00007LTIA|5.0|I'm not going to get in the debate over where this album fits in the &quot;officially sanctioned&quot; order of Yes's albums.  Each and every one of us puts that in a different order - heck, I put them in a drastically different order now than I did 20 years ago.  And that'll probably change in another 20 years, God willing.<br />My brother introduced me to Yes in the late 70's - Close to the Edge in its entirety and Roundabout were far and away my favorites then ('course, they were his, too -- hmmm).  In '82, in the midst of my punk &amp; new wave phase, I bought Fragile on a whim.  Within 3 weeks, I had EVERYTHING they'd ever released.  WOW!!  It was all fantastic and I couldn't get enough of them.  Thankfully, I was single and in the USAF so I could blow every $$ and still have room&amp;board :-)<br />Years went by, I lost most of my album collection in the late 80s, and I didn't listen to any Yes until a year ago, when I started buying the CDs (CTTE first).  As I build my collection again, I find that TFTO is now far and away my favorite.  If it were possible to wear out a CD, it'd be trashed after only 4 months! (BTW, Fragile, Relayer, and Tormato have all taken a precipitous slide in my ordering - some good but much not good).<br />I am absolutely astonished how good this is.  As many others have pointed out, its long songs do demand much of you to listen carefully throughout.  But I find that the best part.  My life is so busy these days (mid-40s, mid-career, mid-kids, mid-life).  To take the time and sit quietly throughout this whole album is a beautiful break in my life.  I find much of it very uplifting and re-energizing, and very little of it that is not fascinating.  I play it over and over at work (thank goodness for wireless headphones and relaxed management!).<br />Give it a good listen - give it a 100 good listens - I think it's worth the effort.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|Tokyo Godfathers is a great movie for those who know anime and for those who don't. The plot is very simple, but the character development is very creative. The movie begins with an attempt to fool us into thinking that the only common bond between the three is being homeless. But as the movie progresses, the viewer learns why they are together and what they all miss. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an uplifting adventure in a non-traditional Christmas tale.

Ack, Ack!<br />Ok, you've read the other reviews, you know who's in it, and that it's based on trading cards, etc. <br />It's a funny movie, one of those so stupid it's funny kind of movies.  Some people like them, some hate them, you know who you are, that should give you a clue as to whether you'll like this movie or not.<br />There are elements from Independence Day and War of the Worlds, the movie that Independence day was based on, as well as others.  The final solution comes straight from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.<br />You'll never think about Slim Whitman the same way again.<br />74s181...
B00006GFA1|4.0|Although not a s good as Rated R, this album can sure hold its own against any rock album. All of the songs are heavy and good, and I love the pure screaming energy that QOTSA can give a song. The sense of humor is really funny. Like putting fake radio stations broadcasts between songs. No One Knows and Millionaire are probably the best songs on the album, even tho Go With The Flow and Six Shooter are extremely good. i think it's a really good album all in all. Go out and buy this, along with Rated R.
B000002IZ4|5.0|In retrospect, 'Purple' is the most unique album to come out of the grunge period. It has style, hard rocking riffs, great melodies, sing-a-long lyrics,  and on top of that a very diverse/ecclectic collection of well recorded, wonderfully crafted songs.<br />The significance of this album is that it shows a band who is no longer just going through the motions, but is actually creating and evolving into true 'songwriters and arraingers'. Each song has it's own character and feel which is almost absent from all other 'Grunge' releases of it's time. They are all unique and diverse, but they don't lose their edge and wit.<br />The prominent melodic bass lines (Mr DeLeo is very underrated) and unique chord structures (So is the other Mr. DeLeo) are what brings life to these recordings.<br />STP have always delivered with each album they've released. They are great songwriters, and I feel that this album is the perfect summation of all of their works. Rock, pop/rock, accoustic, funky/groovy, psychadelic... It's all here.<br />One of the top 10 albums of the 90's!!<br />All the best, -AndyMan-
0312995423|5.0|One of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long while. I can see that some reviewers are more tech savvy than I and recognized inconsistancies in the plot line, however, I was not burdened with such facts when I read this book. I can only say that I was engrossed from the opening page. I found it action packed and a thrill to read. I only wish I could have put it down -- so that I could have savored the experience longer. Suspend disbelief and enjoy this one. I sure did.
0060930187|5.0|This book ranks as one of my top ten favorites.  You don't have to know Plath's writing to like this book, but it helps.  Her novel is as electrically charged and moving as her poetry is.  This book just blew me away when I read it twenty years ago, and today, after a re-reading, I'm blown away again.  <br />Also recommended:  Jackson McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD
B0001HLVSC|4.0|I didn't read the novels I must confess, but I'm sure this movie could have been much more. But it was for the $$$ & mass consumption. However good Russell Crowe is, & he was great, by the way, he doesn't come cheap.<BR>  That said, it is a very good, rather uncomplicatted movie. Lots of little bits on life at sea with the Royal Navy in 1805. Aside from the obvious conflict with the the French ship, & the pursuit of it, Capt. Jack has few problems. There is none of the passion of the Bounty or Capt. Ahab chasing Moby Dick.<BR>  He has a row with his best friend & ship's surgeon/ scientist. It provides a sub-plot, that is mended later. The ship's company grumbles about a lashing, a lack of water & the ship being \\"in irons\\" for days. But those last two are hardly Capt. Jack's fault. At least there was plently of rum & the crew stayed loyal. Capt. Jack was consistent throughout the movie. He was decent, urbane  his crew loved & admired him & that didn't change. Plus he had some amusing stories about his two encounters with Lord Nelson, Britain's greatest super-hero of the day. The climatic sea battle, & the special effects through-out were some of the best ever. The movie was over too soon & I'd like to see a sequel. Even a prequel would be nice.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Uuum...how do i put this into words, the CD is utter perfection! Kristin Chenoweth's great character voice is the frosting on the DELICIOUS cake that Idina Menzel, my idol after Defying Gravity, has baked with her bare hands and her astonishing, awe-inspiring voice! Idina is the only peron who can give goosebumps through a CD, make you weep for joy as you sit, heart racing, listening. There are no exact words for Idina's talent, so I'll just say...my life has changed after listening to the CD! Idina, please, never stop!
B00000JCOV|1.0|I'm going to admit, I used to be depressed, suicidal even. I couldn't wait to get home from school and pop this into my CD player and let loose all my anger and agnst while listening to Corey scream about his pain and how he wants to kill himself and everyone else. Fast foreward 4 or 5 years and now I realize how ignorant I was back then and I realize how stupid this band was. Sure, having 9 members in the band and the mask and jumpsuit gimmick and their crazy stage presence was amusing, but there is really no musicianship, they just try to be as loud and angry as they can. The 2 guitarists don't play any melodies, they just try to make weird noises and play &quot;Life is Peachy&quot;-era KoRn riffs (some of the worst guitar playing ever - in my opinion), the drummer just trys to play as fast as humanly possible without any creativity, the bassist can barely be heard, and is it really necessary to have both a DJ AND a sampler? (some say he also play keyboards but I never heard any keyboards in any Slipknot song). The 2 percussionists idea sometimes works well (the best example being in &quot;Prosthetics&quot;) but it isn't enough to help the band any. Hell, even Corey Taylor himself said Slipknot was a joke, though he has returned to the band and made a new album that will be out shortly. One wonders if he and the band has gotten wiser and imporved themselves this time around, but I doubt it.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|The best that can be said of this movie is that the special effects, realistic sea battles, and cinematography are fantastic.  They really make the movie.  Unfortunately, the story itself is rather plodding and does /not/ do Patrick O'Brain's novel justice.  The plot is essentially a cat and mouse game between Captain Aubrey (British) and a French ship in 1805.  There are subplots-such as leadership, bonding of the crew, superstition, and the brilliant seamanship of the Captain.  The ship's doctor is a very interesting character-both caring, scientific minded, but aboard a warship.  Unfortunately, none of these aspects are ever explored in enough depth to give take the movie to the next level.  There was a lot of potential for storytelling squandered.<br />Overall, I would rate the movie a 6 out of 10.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|This cd gets a 5 out of 5 from me. Every song is good, go get it. Best rap cd of the year so far... Shady records again.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I heard Kanye West's &quot;Through The Wire&quot;, and completely fell in love with his words and style. I thereafter eagerly awaited his CD. My anticipation was not in vain! I am a college student and this CD totally talked to me. Within a week of my buying it I had listened to it so much that I could sing all the songs. Kanye has true vision. That is heard clearly through each song on &quot;College Dropout&quot;. If you don't believe me, then you're crazy. Everyone should BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0767817478|5.0|It's been almost six years since this film came out back in 1998. I can remember the very first TV Spot on television around New Years. As a HUGE Godzilla fan I was excited to say the least. And I must tell you, when it finally came out I wasn't dissapointed, and to this day I still feel the same way.<br />It's a darn shame that this film gets blasted like it does.<br />There are a couple of main issues critics and Godzilla fans have with the film. The story and the monster itself, 'Godzilla'.<br />If you look back at all of the original Japanese Godzilla flicks, you aren't going to find a great (not to mention BELIEVABLE) story or plot. I realize this, even being a fan of all things Godzilla. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' atleast, in my opinion, had the audience believing what was going on up on the screen. The story may not be 'The Godfather', but c'mon, this is a giant monster movie!<br />And what was wrong with the new Godzilla look? Nothing. If you get two action figures, one being a model of the original Godzilla from the Japanese series and a model of the new American Godzilla and put them side by side you will find differences but both are remarkably alike in alot of ways. They both have the spikes, gigantic size, and have that famous roar. The major differences being the skin color, face, and longer legs. I loath it when people bring up how they shouldn't have changed Godzilla's look. I mean, I love the old Godzilla look, it may be silly to some, but to me it's still cool. But it would NOT have worked for this film at ALL. If they had made the American version with a man in a suit and had him flying around on his tail kicking monsters, it would have ended up being viewed as something to laugh at here in the U.S. <br />What the American 'Godzilla' brings us is a believable monster that has the spirit and characteristics of the original.<BR>It's just more realistic. Shouldn't we have expected that? It's something the creators of the original attempted at doing but were limited to rubber suits. It's something the Japanese audience and G-Fans accept, but the majority of the American audience will not. It's sad that most Godzilla fans and critics do not understand this.<br />I personally believe that the majority of the general audience ENJOYED this film. It's just the critical lambasting from G Fans and Critics that got alot of attention and therefore this gets labeled as a 'bad' film. It's sad really.<br />This is one of my favorite DVD's to plug in. It's Big, Loud, and Fun. And although we've had lots of great films with tons of Special Effects since this film came out, there's nothing quite like it.<br />The direction and cinematography are superb and the score by David Arnold is highly memorable.<br />There are lots of special features including all of the trailers.<br />So take a look at it, be open and I'm sure you will enjoy the fantastic pop-corn entertainment known as &quot;GODZILLA&quot;.
B0001GL3KE|4.0|I know that a lot of people have a problem with this movie not being believeable, being sugary-sweet, etc. People, it's just a movie! I went to see it with one of my best friends and we weren't expecting an Oscar-worthy film...we just wanted to have fun. If you just want to have fun and not get into a really deep drama, if you want to laugh and not take yourself (or the movie) too seriously, then you should watch it. I didn't leave the theatre feeling depressed or angry, (well, maybe a little angry about having the absolutely gorgeous love interest of Hugh Grant being considered &quot;fat&quot;). I left the theatre feeling happy that some things worked out and I got a chance to laugh. Take it for what it is: A Hollywood money-maker. You'll like the movie much better if you do.
6305972591|5.0|Among my top ten horror films, Children of the Corn succeeds on all levels.<BR>Acting, cinematography, music, and direction are all first rate.<BR>The concept of children chasing adults with scythes and other pointy objects is just terrifying to me. This film is a classic and nothing short of terrific.<BR>The DVD comes with a trailer and booklet.<br />Contrary to what you may have heard, it really is a great series of horror films.<BR>I highly recommend checking out the 6 sequels. Most all of them are genuinely frightening.
B000089RVX|5.0|As a non-radio listener, I don't keep up with what is current.  I have children who do, so I am familiar with some of the songs and artists.  Although I have heard some of the bands one of the reviewer compares this band to, I do not agree that this is run on the mill or corporate music.   <br />Once in a blue moon, I will put in a album like this, never having heard any of their music, and be changed by it.  This has elements of many music types, rock, goth, pop and more.  I love just about every song, and Amy's voice is amazing.<br />If you like the singles, buy the album.  It is the best album I bought in 2003
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|I'm a fan of the more underground/off mainstream hip-hop (Atmosphere, Jedi Mind Tricks, The Roots, etc.), but I was very pleased with D12's first album. &quot;That's How&quot; and &quot;Revelation&quot; were mildly funny, but serious at the same time. &quot;American Psycho&quot;, being the standout track on that album, was just amazing. However, this CD doesn't compare so much with Devil's Night. &quot;My Band&quot;, the first single, was funny, and since I never watch MTV or listen to the radio I never really got sick of it. 40 Oz., the second single, just sucked. It was a Lil' Jon-type beat and chorus that lacked lyrics. I refrained from downloading anymore from the album until I could buy it to increase my excitement. The skits are interesting but get boring fast as usual, and the album is pretty much mild. The instruments behind the beats (good beats as usual) are disappointing. I miss the fun, wild instruments of &quot;Pistol Pistol&quot; and &quot;Rap Game&quot;, but these aren't total crap like most claim them to be.<br />The standouts on the album are &quot;D12 World&quot;, &quot;American Psycho II&quot;, and &quot;Get My Gun&quot;. The only song I skip every time is &quot;40 Oz.&quot;, which is just mainstream hype to get popular. Nevertheless, D12 has released much more than 2 albums worth of songs on the Internet, so I can hardly say they're only for the money.<br />This CD is worth the 10 bucks I spent for it, but if you only think this as mildly good hip-hop and want something more, go grab &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot; by The Roots and &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot; by Dilated Peoples.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|This film is OK. I can enjoy fantasy and symbolism in a movie, but the whimsical and circus-type elements in this particular film were a little too much for me. Although, by the end of the film it does all makes more sense. <br />This is the kind of film that you could watch a second time and experience it again like new. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it enough the first time to want to watch it a second time. <br />I think the father's character should have been fleshed out a little more. It didn't like his character much as an old man. I did like him as a young man, but the episodic bits didn't give me enough to really sympathize with him. The son's character was well done, however.<br />The acting, directing, and special effects are good. I imagine Tim Burton fans will enjoy this movie. The average person may not enjoy it as much.<br />As far as moral content, it was refreshing to see a character choose to remain faithful to his wife. However, disappointingly, the &quot;family values&quot; merit of the film is undercut by its nude scenes (as well as some swearing).<br />As far as the DVD elements, it's got the standard &quot;plot rehash, with comments by the actors&quot; stuff, as well as running commentary by the director, I believe. There were a few other things too, like a quiz, but I wasn't interested enough to look into those.

0316666343|5.0|I don't mean to sound like I live under a rock, but I had never heard of this book or this author before my trip to Barnes and Noble one day.  I went with friends and saw that this book was 20% off and was a #1 National Bestseller so I decided to get it.  Well, less than two days later - I finished the book and was profoundly affected.  I knew nothing about the book before I started reading - I didn't even read the liner notes.  I just took the plunge and started reading and got completely sucked in to the story and the characters.  <br />In my own suburbia, we have an Indian family just like the Singhs.  A mother, son and father (I've never seen the father).  I felt like I knew Susie, Lindsey and Buckley.  I wanted to go over to their house and be friends with them, comfort them, tease Susie about Ray and Lindsey about Sam.  This book had me bawling in parts and trust me, I'm not that kind of person.  I don't cry at books unless they suck me in and I can imagine that I'm part of the character's lives.  <br />After reading all of the reviews on this book and seeing that a lot of people put this book in the category of &quot;overrated&quot; or &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;too depressing&quot;, I just have to laugh.  The book has received four out of five stars and was reviewed 1887 times, so clearly this is not the consensus about the book.  I say - give it a try.  <br />This is one of my favorite books of all time - right up there with Where The Red Fern Grows, Bridge to Teribithia and To Kill A Mockingbird.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This movie was nominated for Best Picture.  You'd think that would indicate that that would be an indication of a good movie.  My friend and I thought that when we went to see it live.  So we sat, waiting for the good part to come  -- and then the movie ended.
B00006RINF|5.0|This CD is fantastic from start to finish. No need to say anything else.
1592400876|4.0|As someone who aced graduate grammar classes as a teen in college, I share some of the author's plaints. DVDs can't own anything. They have no DVD's. They can only be.

Lola's advice on appearance and character tops the Truss.
6302373921|5.0|It is important to recognize the pedigree of filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker when considering this documentary.  In addition to Depeche Mode 101, Pennebaker produced Don't Look Back which chronicles Bob Dylan's 1965 British concert tour, as well as the landmark documentary Monterey Pop in 1968.  This film culminates a movement in documentary filmmaking that was initiated by Peenebaker, and continued in films such as Woodstock, Gimme Shelter, and The Last Waltz.  This film is more than concert footage and backstage interviews, it serves to capture the spirit of a moment in music history.
B000002J2F|4.0|Anyone who says &quot;Post-Hackett Genesis sounds just like Phil Collins solo&quot; or &quot;Genesis turned into a pop band when Steve left&quot; has obviously never listened to an album like Duke.  (They probably never listened to much early Genesis either, aside from the songs that were 7 minutes or longer.)  Genesis' music has always been a hybrid of pop and progressive styles, and Duke carries that tradition into the 1980s.<br />That isn't to say they hadn't changed at all.  Duke has an overall happier and more straightforward feel than previous efforts, and the lyrics deal with real-life issues (especially Collins' marital problems) rather than the surreal fantasies of their past.  Also, the Motown/R&amp;B influence that Genesis hinted at on previous albums is much more prominent here, particularly on Behind The Lines, Misunderstanding, Turn It On Again, and the heartbreaking Please Don't Ask (gotta love the bass licks on that song), and the whole failed-romance theme that runs throughout the album suits this kind of music very well.  The closing instrumentals, Duke's Travels and Duke's End, carry on in the tradition of songs like Los Endos and In That Quiet Earth.<br />A few songs do fall short of previous standards -- Mike's &quot;Alone Tonight&quot; is rather generic and whiny, and Tony's &quot;Cul-De-Sac&quot; is unnecessarily bombastic in places.  Also, it's a shame that two excellent songs, &quot;Evidence of Autumn&quot; and &quot;Open Door&quot;, were left off the album...perhaps they could have been used to replace the two mentioned above.  <br />Still, this album has plenty of good compositions, great arrangements, and passionate performances -- Phil's vocals in particular have never sounded better.  Forget all the progheads who think Genesis sold out when they stopped sounding like Yes/ELP/King Crimson...they can keep listening to Spock's Beard/Dream Theater/Flower Kings and all the other prog poser bands from the last decade.  This is great music with a lot of creativity and soul.  This is Genesis.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I downloaded the songs and i've got to say this is the rawest **** i've heard in a very long time. For once all of D12's members were at there best and i really like the fact that the beats are dope. Great CD to buy and despite what everyone says, BIZARRE DOES NOT MESS UP THE FLOWS OF THE SONGS HE IS IN. He is tight. D12 fan or not, i recommend this to anyone with a good taste of rap music.
B000002HAJ|4.0|The only reason this CD gets 4 stars and not 5 is b/c of the exclusion of This Twilight Garden.  I'm a believer that all Cure albums are good/great in some way, and Wish is great.  From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea will knock you on your a*s every time you hear it, it's that good.  Open, Apart, End, Cut (yea!), and To Wish the Impossible Things are all classic Cure tracks.  This is the best \\"starter\\" CD for new Cure fans - not as depressing as Disintegration, and not as frightening as Prnography.  If you don't own this, what are you thinking?
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|Before 50 Cent and G Unit came along, there was the raw D12. Devils night was one of the most controversial CDs of the new century and was incredibly dope. Their second CD lacks the originality of Devil's Night. The beats all sound the same and the lyrics get repetitive (various lists of ways to kill somebody). There are some good songs, but all it's just not as good as Devil's Night.
B000063JZQ|4.0|If reading the play wasn't enough, this movie kept me asking for more. Roman Polanski brilliantly executed what I had envisioned while reading the script for the play.

B00005JMEW|4.0|&quot;Kill Bill, Vol. 1&quot; reconfirms that director Quentin Tarantino revels in the depictation of oodles of gory violence.  Trying to follow a similar format to his masterpiece &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, he falls a little short.  Kill Bill, by comparison, lacks the scope and proficiency in weaving together storylines to form the plot.  Having said that, Tarantino is a genius in this blood and guts type of genre.  His film is visually stunning and the choreography of the martial arts scenes is mind boggling.<br />Tarantino fave Uma Thurman is statuesque and athletically gifted as the vengeful martial artist bride who is out to even the score with an assassination squad that murdered all nine in her wedding party.  She appears to have been part of that hit squad.  Nearly killed in the attack, she awakens 4 years later from a coma seeking to kill those responsible for her violation.  Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Viveca Fox and an eye patched Darryl Hannah comprise her targets.<br />Tarantino composes his flick in comic book style with no pretext to clarify or explain things.  I was impressed but felt ripped off with the idea that he was setting me up for a Vol 2, Vol 3, and who knows how many more.  In reality the movie's only real motivation is to line the director's pockets.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|The use of the word, actually, in this movie is funny.  Every character uses it,  is this what is done in England? or was this suppose to be funny.  The bonus features are great, except for the fact that Colin Firth has no commentary or deleted scenes.  I still wish a version was made available that the children could watch deleting the naked couple and the paintings.  The commentary is hilarious with Hugh Grant and Richard Curtis, both seem to have heterosexual man crushes on Colin.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually is a fun movie that will leave a smile on your face and a tear drop as well. Grant is his normal character,  goofball English gent. Emma Thompson provides an excellent performance, a real emotional part. There's a lot of love that people can relate to. In summary a great movie with British humor and lots of love.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|Wow, I was was really amazed that they went kind of serious and didn't have a lot of funny songs on this album. I really think they should have put a PSA with Eminem talking then the rest of the crew starts beating the crap out of him for saying something about black girls.  They steped their game up a little on some of the songs but others were in my opinion, Just Wack! Don't get me wrong this was a good album but just good not a 5 star album like some of the members put on there.All the beats on this album are sick! The songs I would look out for are<BR>How Come <BR>Git Up<BR>Good Die Young <BR>Leave Dat Boy Alone<BR>ALSO WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T READ THE SAUCE AND BENZINO'S BS ABOUT SHADY RECORDS AND EMINEM.

0553573403|5.0|Beautiful. Captivating. Imaginative. FANTASTIC. Need I say more? Of course.<br />I have read Robert Jordan, Brian Jacques, Terry Goodkind, JRR Tolkein (even before the movie came out) (my father is a Tolkein fan), Terry Brooks, and Mark Anthony. Perhaps more, but I can't remember them all. I was at first skeptical about the quality of this book, but when I saw that 28 out of 30 people gave it a 5-star and glowing review, I tried it. And I have gone to bed at 12:30 am every night because I simply cannot put it down! 3 dimensional characters, with villians that we can identify with. Villains that you can take pity on, and heroes whose flaws shine through as much as their deeds. Not much magic, but alive with the tragedy, bravado, and inner feelings of every character. I used to rate Robert Jordan as my second favorite author (with the first as JRR Tolkein), but now I put him in 3rd, with George R.R. Martin as 2nd. Fantastic series, and I recommend this to all ages.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil is over-the-top comic book fun. Many of the people who slam this movie need to lighten up. Some are concerned that the movie will offend the blind! Give me a break! Others are not fans of superheroes so they paid money to see a superhero movie and then complained because they didn't like it because they aren't into superheroes! Others wanted Spider-man 2 and some, who are not fans of the Daredevil character, paid to see it and didn't like many of the elements that make Daredevil Daredevil. If you don't like Daredevil you shouldn't see Daredevil. <br />Then there are those who just wanted to see their particular favorite version of the character, but the film didn't give them just the version that they wanted. It pays homage to the wide history of the character. To some that's a bad thing. The origin of the character from the animated version is even given a nod, but that just made some folks real unhappy. They wanted their version of Daredevil and nothing else. Then there are those who don't like Jen Garner or Ben Affleck, but paid to see them so they could complain. Would you watch a movie with these kind of people? Could you listen to the gripes about how the superhero movie they just saw was a &quot;waste&quot; because it had superheroes in it? Are you that kind of person? Not me. <br />I enjoyed Daredevil. It's a good movie. It has a great cast. There is plenty of Daredevil stuff in the film. My only complaint is that it could have been longer. It seems really trimmed down, but it's not too off the mark and entertained me all they way through. I GIVE DAREDEVIL: B+. The directors cut is possibly in the works and should be even more fun.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton is a great stroryteller and this movie is another one to add to the list.  In this movie he did not use his usual cast of characters (aka: Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, etc) but that doesnt change how this story is told.  It goes back and forth between past and present.  The scenery in the movie is very rich (especially in the circus).  I loved it the first time I saw it and will watch it again and again.  I don't want to give it all away.....so go watch it!
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|D12 is slowly taking out Eminem out of thier rap group. It is beginning to now sound like all the other rap groups out there. Devils was awesome i bought it twice but this album has is not devils night.  I found the only track worth listening to were with Eminem in it. I am glad i didn't have to buy this album to find out how weak it was.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay are an amazing band, i went away with my uncle about 3 years ago and he had the parachutes album on the car stereo. I bougth that album as soon as we got to where we were going and i been hooked ever since. Chris martins voice is fantastic, not straight line music brilliance, but to the point where it sticks to the music and gives it an amazing uniqueness.  I love coldplay and will queue for their next album!!!
B00009RDGA|5.0|Adapted from the matchless novel \\"Addie Pray\\" by Joe David Brown, Paper Moon is set in the Midwest/dustbowl during the Great Depression/Roosevelt era.  One-of-a-kind directing by Peter Bogdanovich, beautiful black & white cinematography, a great musical score with snippets of old time radio shows like Fibber McGee & Molly, Jack Benny and a host of others.<br />Real-life father & daughter duo, Ryan & Tatum O'Neil team up in this gem of a movie.<br />Ryan plays Moses Pray.  A slick, sliver-tongued, gold toothed, travelling huckster & who always has a new con to turn up his sleeve such as door to door Bible selling to recently widowed women, bootlegging, short changing, and a \\"car swappin' wrasslin' match\\" between Moses and a very young Randy Quaid.  Tatum plays Addie and garnered the coveted Oscar for her performance at the tender age of 10. Addie decides to get in on many of the cons and becomes quite a prolific short change artist. Addie decides on her own to take Moses' last name and travel with him under the guise as his daughter.  In one of the best scenes in the movie they deal with whether or not Addie is Moses' illegitimate daughter. That scene is set in a diner while drinking NeHi's and eating Coney Islands.  Addie is sure that Moses is, indeed, her father as she states, \\"We got the SAME jaw!\\"  Moses responds and says, \\"I know a lady who has the jaw of a bullfrog but that doesn't mean that she's the damn things mother!\\" Addie asks Moses, \\"You meet my mamma in a barroom?\\" (implying that her mamma was a prostitute).  Moses comes right back asking Addie, \\"You think that just because a man meets a woman in a barroom means that they get a baby?\\"  Ryan and Tatum's bantering repartee is natural, hilarious and touching all at the same time.<br />The Prays fall \\"prey\\" to a con played on them (well, Moses anyway) as the film progesses, by a hootchie-cootchie sideshow carnival dancer/prostitute named Miss Trixie Delight, adeptly played by Madelyn Kahn who was also nominated for an Oscar. The sneaky and a little jealous Addie deals with Miss Trixie in her own time and also helps out Miss Trixie's maid, Imogene and gives her money to return back to her family.<br />This is a great family movie with a touching father/daughter story to share.  No nudity, few \\"cuss\\" words, and an all-around crowd pleaser whether you are 6 or 106. I don't mind telling you that this is my favorite movie of all time and I have viewed it upwards of 100 times.  I still laugh, cry, and go through a multitude of emotions no matter how many times a watch the film.  Certainly, a hallmark of a great cinematic masterpiece!  Happy Watching!minated for an Oscar.

0553573403|5.0|(...) the violence and sex: yes, this novel is incredibly brutal. The opening chapter sees an 8 year-old boy witnessing his father decapitating a traitor. If this doesn't tip you off, nothing will. Some parts of the novel are so violent and downright -mean- that they made me cringe. But you know what? That was a good thing.<br />Martin's words is not filled with honorable heroes and scheming, Batman-style villains. His heroes are tormented by difficult choices, and his villains act with cruelty and without any mercy. And that's what's so great about it: it gives a believeable aura to Martin's world, one that will make you wonder why he is the only one to take this road. Compared to Martin, other fantasy authors seem to be writing about benign fantasy lands filled with gentle people and unimaginative villains.<br />This overall brutality translates many times into shocks as you read through. No, heroes and loveable secondary characters do NOT always make it to the end. And when they die, they don't necessarily make a redeeming sacrifice that saves the land. Sometimes they die alone, unavenged, at the ends of cruel people. This made me reel from shock in some parts, making Martin's world so much more -dangerous- than any other fantasy world.<br />All this to say, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" deserves to be called a modern masterpiece of fantasy, and it does stand very high in the genre. It's low-key approach to fantastic elements is refreshing, and the characters are exceptionally engaging, whether they're deluded little girls or cunning dwarves.<br />Is it better than Tolkien? Do yourself a favor and don't think about it. For sure, it is certainly more in tune with the demands of modern fans for gritty, action-packed adventures. If you thought the LotR movies were better than the books because they packed more of a punch, then you'll think Martin is better than Tolkien. My own opinion is that they both deserve to feature on the shelf of any fantasy fanatic, and leave it at that.at.

B00005QGAX|5.0|Ok, so this title will make you scratch your head and say, &quot;Fool, what's your problem?! Michael a bad boy? Ha! This is the man who calls himself Peter Pan!&quot; LOL But lemme explain, before 1987, people didn't know how edgy Michael Jackson could be. On his third album as an adult solo artist, Michael broke more barriers again. This time enlisting a mixture of funk, rock, soul, rhythm-and-blues, gospel, jazz, pop, dance, and hip-hop (circa 1987). He also began his now trademark growls through the song. What a lot of people don't know is that Otis Redding also sung in growls so Michael will tell you why he got to sing like that. You may call it screaming and yelling but dog-gone it, if Michael wanted to show his anger, let him. Funny thing is no one was seeing him as a &quot;thug&quot; or a &quot;lady killer&quot; probably until he did some of the videos for &quot;Bad&quot;. While the videos were great, the music was great too. The music was powerful stuff, man.<br />&quot;Bad&quot;, the single, had SUCH A HUGE impact on today's hip-hop in terms of sampling that it doesn't make sense. Possibly one of the most celebrated songs in the history of music and of course of Michael's career. If Janet's &quot;No my first name ain't Baby, it's Janet, Ms. Jackson, if you're nasty&quot; was the singular catchphrase in &quot;Nasty&quot;, then &quot;Who's Bad?!&quot; was Mike's in &quot;Bad&quot;. &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; is classic pop and R&amp;B basically. &quot;Speed Demon&quot; is basically a militant funk song in the spirit of James Brown, not only that but to this day, you still don't know what the hell Michael was talking about at the time. Maybe it meant he had broken the law (?) Anyway, moving on. Next, we have &quot;Liberian Girl&quot;, which is an incredible song that encorporates a bit of Zulu tongue from a female African artist. &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; is just corny though. This is the only song WORTH skipping, even Stevie Wonder there doesn'thelp matters. If Mike would've put the songs he did with Roger Troutman and Run DMC, then he would've been able to get his point across with &quot;Bad&quot; IMO. &quot;Another Part of Me&quot; speeds things back up and like SD before it is militant funk with an urban edge. The horns in this baby are wild! &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot; is one of the greatest anthemic songs of inspiration of all time...and I'm not just saying that because Mike's my boy and all either. &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot; is a POP CLASSIC! Nuff said about it! &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; sees Michael finding his inner Robert Plant as he sings with the pain and intensity of a heavy metal singer. Much pleasantly, this song is pure ROCK &amp; ROLL! &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is by far one of the greatest pop, R&amp;B and dance joints of all time! &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; channels Stevie. <br />All in all, this album has really made quite an impact nearly 20 years after it came out. Funny how the media overlooks that nowadays but ANYWAY...<br />Let's see:<BR>5 #1 POP and R&amp;B hits<BR>2 #1 DANCE hits<BR>2 #1 Adult Contemporary hits<br />Mike's first album to DEBUT at #1<BR>Had a huge tour with this that ran for almost 2 years<BR>Brought out one of the greatest performances in Grammy history<br />Music was nice...<br />It's a damn good album. Go cop it if you wanna know why Usher and Justin can only rely on his influence to do what they do. He's a king of something, right? Let the man rest in his throne, okay? Dog-gone it! LOL! YOU'RE DOING WRONG!!! Shhhhhhh! Let me stop. Just go get it...NOW!
0316776963|5.0|I recommend that you dash out and purchase a copy of Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris. I've been reading this one, snuggled under my duvet, and it's hysterical. David takes us on a comic journey growing up in the deep south of the USA, then though many tragicomic adventures as he follows boyfriend, Hugh, to Paris. Good books are often pretty, interesting and useful. This one defiantly qualifies for all three.
078681859X|5.0|The publishing world is always on a constant prowl for the \\"next\\" Harry Potter series.  Who is it that will steal the crown from Britain's reigning fantasy king?  One of the newest contenders comes in the form of Jonathan Stroud's detailed \\"Bartimaeus Trilogy\\".  The first book in this series \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" (other books have not, as of this review, been published in America yet) begins what many hope will become the new \\"it\\" series.  Cleverly combining facets of European and Asian lore, the book is a fascinating character study into the nature of good and bad.  Filled with far more complex imaginings than your average fantasy let's-throw-in-some-brief-historical-facts book, this tale is penned beautifully and is a worthy series within its own right.<br />We begin with a bang of a beginning.  Most authors, no matter if they are writing for adults or children, like to start slowly and build their tale with a heaping helping of exposition.  Not Stroud.  In this book we begin with an exciting summoning of the djinni Bartimaeus by a twelve year-old boy.  The boy, Nathaniel, wishes to avenge himself against a powerful wizard.  As the plot follows Bartimaeus's quest to retrieve the Amulet of Samarkand (as the boy has instructed him to do) we are simultaneously brought up to speed on Nathaniel's life and world.  This is London, but a sort of alternative reality London.  In this world, wizards rule over the commoners (non-magic types) in government positions and teach children as apprentices.  Nathaniel is such an apprentice, bound to an incompetent master.  When he is shamed in front of a group of wizards by one Simon Lovelace (a man far more powerful than his own master) Nathaniel seeks nothing but revenge.<br />So there you have it.  This is a tale about a boy and his smart alecky djinni.  As the book takes pains to explain, demons (like the djinni) are regularly summoned by wizards to do their dirty work.  Humans are, by and large, incapable of magic and simply summon spirits of one sort or another to do magic for them.  Bartimaeus isn't thrilled by this proposition, but he is unwillingly bound to a boy that burns with hate and a bit of the old \\"eye for an eye\\".  The djinni's displeasure is regularly voiced by clever footnotes placed strategically at the bottom of several pages.  Often Bartimaeus's commentary is the great spice of the book.  Nathaniel is a less than humorous individual, though he is capable of deadpan humor.  The book is, itself, an interesting fantasy.  Like the Artemis Fowl books, it has presented the reader with an unsympathetic hero.  In this case, you're dealing with a proud and intelligent but ultimately foolish boy.  Nathaniel is nothing so much as another version of Ged from Ursula LeGuin's \\"The Wizard of Earthsea\\".  The difference here, however, is that Nathaniel doesn't grow as much as you might suspect throughout the course of the story.  And here's where it all gets very very interesting.  The essential nature of what is good and what is bad is all topsy-turvy.  Bartimaeus is the rare character I've read in a fantasy story that is truly of an alien nature.  If he does good things for others, it's usually out of some self-preserving intention or accompanied with a sly jab.  Usually, Bartimaeus is willing to kill anyone and anything about him, including his own master.  Don't expect these characters to follow the old buddy movie routine and grow closer over the course of the tale.  These two have a lot of healthy distrust growing between them, and it's a pleasure to watch.  But how easy is it to read about two people that are, for all intents and purposes, fatally flawed?  Quite, as it happens.<br />I'm always amused at the amount of anti-\\"magic in Harry Potter\\" outrage there is in the world.  Let us consider this book, for example.  In this story you have characters regularly drawing pentacles on the ground to summon up demons from another realm.  If there's a more objectionable idea lodged ina children's book to a heavily religious right-wing Christian conservative, I'd love to hear it.  I will say right here and now that I, personally, don't find anything objectionable in this story.  Bartimaeus himself makes it very clear that he despises this system wherein demons are forced as slaves to work for humans.  On meeting up with an Uncle Tom type of demon, his venom is clearly displayed.  Moreover, the series seems to be taking a rather anti-magician stance, though this is elaborated on less in the plot of this first book than it will in future books in the series, I imagine.<br />The book is nothing so much as a cross between Artemis Fowl (more likable) and Harry Potter (more detailed) with a dash of Wizard of Earthsea for color.  Stroud's writing is fantastic.  He has obviously detailed every inch of this new world out to the nth degree, and you never get the sense that the book has gone on too long (a flaw I found in \\"Inkheart\\") or that he doesn't know how to end it.  I will state for the record that this is an incredibly enjoyable read.  Bartimeus even allows himself a small jab at the Harry Potter series (see page 85 for his quip about wizards being bussed to boarding school) which is utterly in keeping with his character.  And though this book wasn't overflowing with strong female characters, they exist.  I suspect we'll be seeing far more of them in the future books in the series than we have thus far.  Call it a hunch.<br />Currently this book stands at 462 pages.  A hefty read, but nothing a fascinated kid won't be able to handle.  I recently wrote in my review of \\"Mortal Engines\\" (highly recommend it, by the way) that that book was the true successor to Harry Potter.  I may have to extend that compliment to the \\"Bartimaeus Trilogy\\".  Droll and fast-paced without ever growing tiresome or annoying, this is one of the best dern books to be placed in the hands of fantasy-loving kids in a while.  Give it to the young `uns to ponder over sometime.  It's well worth a gander.a children's book to a heavily religious right-wing Christian conservative, I'd love to hear it.

B00009TB5G|5.0|Dear Fans: The extra 48 minutes in this &quot;version&quot; are a step up in the trilogy.  It improves the whole movie, given the fact that in my opinion the theatrical version left out many details, or did not develop certain passages of the book to an appropiate level of detail, but how many minutes can you stand in a movie theatre?  That is not the case of a DVD that you can watch in the comfort of your own home.<br />The experience is greatly improved, specially for die hard fans such as myself.  I was rather disapointed in the theatres and  now I can´t wait for the extended version of The Return of The King wich is rumored to have an extra hour and a half of footage.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|i loved it completely today, as i opened and viewed my glorious new dvd! truly tim burton's masterpiece, it cracks you up, gets you so involved and wrapped up in it, it's hard to let it end! the acting by the entire cast is wonderful, the cinematography is breathtaking, the story so full of imagination, humor, and heartwarming events, you may find it irrestable as i did, and view it all over again. the dvd ac-3 sound is incredible as is the digital transfer. it is, at times, astounding!  do not pass this one by-it is a marvel.
0385484518|5.0|Death ends a life, not a relationship. Love conquers all. Morrie Schwartz and Mitch Albom know better. After Mitch Albom had parted with his favorite professor Morrie Schwartz after some 20 years, Albom, a struggling former musician, had become the No. 1 sports columnist. When Nightline broadcasted a show on the dying professor, who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable neurological illness that melts the nerves in the brain, Albom rediscovered his enamored mentor from college in the final leg of the old man's life. Albom poignantly regretted that he had not kept in contact as he promised at graduation and got on a plane and visited the gentle old man sooner, before the disease ravaged his nerves and robbed him for his life basics.<br />But if the old man taught his student-friend anything at all, it was the fact that nothing was too late in life. As Albom rekindled the friendship with his professor whose life was as if being marked off by crossing the days on the calendar, their encounter turned into a final class that met every Tuesday on the meaning of life. Tuesdays with Morrie is the transcription of this encounter, Morrie's concluding remarks on the meaning of life, taught from life experience, with a sense of complete detachment of the world and inveterate cultural values. This final lecture challenges Albom and all of us in the values of death, love, money, marriage, emotion, family, regret and culture.<br />The more Mitch conversed with Morrie, the more he realized how much his insights of life had faded and gone astray. As the old man sidled closer to death, the things Morrie said in his last months transcended all religious differences with a profundity that calls everyone to re-evaluate, to cudgel the meaning of life. Morrie reiterated and advocated for love, which allows one to die without really \\"going away\\", for the love one created in lifetime was still embraced in memories. Maybe death really had a way to make one learn how to live. The one amazing thing about Morrie is that he decided he would not be ashamed of dying for he saw death as yet a beginning.<br />2004 (23) © MYto live.

B0001HAISG|5.0|This movie was quite outstanding.  The only shortcoming was the actor who did Peter Pan who at times had spots of poor acting, otherwise, a delicious execution of this psycological tale and an understanding of the history behind the story makes for a marvelous movie.  Pulls a few punches but the story is pure. A true keeper.<br />Effects were awesome, and the world of Neverland very absorbing.  Hook - best performance of a Hook I have ever seen, and Wendy.. you gotta see the movie.  Brilliantly casted.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Those three words will forever vanquish this DVD to less than 5 stars.  C'mon George -- this is NOT the move we have all grown to love, this is your remake (much akin to Ted Turner's colorization) of a classic.  Greedo shooting, the rough Jaba scene, and Luke screaming like a girl as he falls -- are all intersting, and great examples of digital manipulation, but they do not belong in this movie.<br />Last, of all the edits you made, why not bring us the movie in DTS!? That would have been a worthwhile revision, as opposed to obvious CGI cartoon inserts.<br />These are great flicks (I was born in 1971, so Star Wars was my life!), and I will buy the DVD, but I anticipate shelling out another 100 bucks in a couple of years when you issue the super expanded version which contains the directors edit as well as the original theatrical version (ala \\"Aliens\\")<br /><br />**There was news in May of 2006 that this fall, Lucas will, indeed, re-release the trilogy without the digital enhancements!!** I TOLD YOU SO!!!
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Being a huge admirer of Tim Burton's work, I eagerly anticipated seeing &quot;Big Fish.&quot; However, I was completely disappointed by it. This was supposed to be a very personal film for him and yet it feels utterly impersonal.  There is no point at which I was pulled into the story.  Although Billy Crudup's character knows his father is dying, he treats him father as a child and seems to have no emotion about the eventual loss. This seemed unbelievable. I was also expecting something more colorful and visually stunning. Expect for one tender scene in which Albert Finney and Jessica Lange are in the bathtub fully clothed together, this film unfortunately falls short of it's potential. It's possible that I had expectation that were too high, but nevertheless, it just didn't grab me.

Clear, concise, and often funny, it guides you through the mysteries of those little squiggles and dots that make words into phrases and sentences.

I also hold him dear to my heart because my generation created him. I followed all of Ozzy's hired guns...and then after Jake E. Lee this long blonde haired punk comes along. Well, the kid grew up and he has shown us his pride and glory by continuing the era of awesome riffs, lyrics, furious leads and now he blows us away with an album like this. <br />I bought the C.D. about three hours ago and since then I have hit the back button to repeat the songs three or four times. I keep thinking I found the best song and then I hear the next one. It's that good!!!<br />I saw the few reviews that in a criticizing manner tried to compare this to previous albums. No...it's not The Blessed Hellride...that album rocked by the way. This album is for the people who couldn't believe how good the Book of Shadows was!!! I'm so happy he did another album at that level....and here it is.....Hangover Music Vol.VI...how appropriate!!!...go...now...Buy it!!!! Love it!!! It's Awesome!!!!
B000002J1Y|4.0|I have to reduce this classic live recording to 4 stars because of the horrid remastering.  Too much high end on a lot of the instruments.<br />BUT, the CD is awesome otherwise and quite enjoyable if you can get past the sound.  <br />ALL tracks are the highlights. No one track particularly stands out for me.<br />One disappointment and I don't have my LP to compare it with - the vocals seem to be set back on the &quot;side 6&quot; of Yessongs. (Yours Is No Disgrace and Starship Trooper).<br />Still, the music is the monster here.<br />A++ for the album iteself.  C for sound quality.
B00011RPB0|5.0|When I saw this movie, I was with (I believe) three other people, and we all agreed that this was quite possibly one of the best movies from the last five years.  Incredibly written and beautifully directed, Lost in Translation is a movie that some people get, some people don't.  I remember sitting in the theatre watching people (usually middle-aged) get up and leave, presumably because they were bored.  It's too bad that they really missed the point of the movie, or expected it to be something that it wasn't.  If you're expecting an action-packed drama or quirky romantic comedy, you'll be horribly disappointed.  But if you're looking for a beautiful and deep look at love and romance, give this movie a go.  Closest comparisons I could make would put this movie alongside Traffic, another oft-overlooked and critically acclaimed movie.<br />Lost in Translation is melodic in it's presentation, and the incredible dialogue, top-notch directing and perfect sound editing make this movie a gem.  Sadly, it looks as though it's doomed to be a cult classic, held back by those who, well, weren't quite ready for it.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|I just listened to the entire D-12 &quot;D-12 World&quot; cd and honestly, IT SUCKS. The facts are that Eminem is a LESS then spectuclar producer and that the members of D-12 (outside of Proof) are average/below average at best (Bizaar has NO BUSINESS on a mic). The fact that Eminem is TRYING to be gangster really tarnishes him. I believe he is too talented to TRY to come off like a 50 Cent wannabe. <br />&quot;Devils Night&quot; only sold 2 million copies (low considering Eminem is in the group) and I do not expect this cd do to much better. There is not one song on this cd I would consider a hit. &quot;My Band&quot; is a stupid god awful song. The BEST song on this cd is &quot;Good Die Young&quot;. Definately not saying much.<br />I would recommend burning this cd off a friend. Save your money, it's not worth going out and buying unless your a DIEHARD D-12/Eminem fan.
B00005R87Q|1.0|This one is not recommended it is however good but there are to many kids that like this stuff and are stupidly reperforming these stunts the movie just for this should have been rated X and only seen by the mature.It has killed to many and done so much bad.In November of 2003 a kid named Greg Farmhouse saw this movie 10 times and he was with his friend Ryan Lefine and with my friend Shawn MacMelely in the car the 2 in the front died on impact in the car accident with no alcohol to play.<BR>And Shawn who was where-ing his seat belt was injured but back to normal quickly so far these kids and any other kids that you<BR>personally no that were killed in Car crashes boycott this
B0000630BT|3.0|painkiller is a hit or miss cd. the title track is amazing and all guns blazing is awsome, &quot;touch of evil&quot; is a classic and &quot;one shot at glory&quot; is priest at their best, but unfortunatly some songs get worse with time, like the silly &quot;leather rebal&quot; and nightcrawler is a weak attempt at the early 80's era, metal meltdown also does nothing for me. I think they tried to hard to be heavy, but like i said there's some classics and some songs that sound silly over time.
B00004STUL|4.0|I have never seen this movie so it will get 4 stars need to get my boycott across to show this point
B0001HAISG|5.0|Exquisite scenes from perfectly realized Victorian townhouse to heart-breakingly beautiful Neverland, made me want this DVD as soon as I left the theater. London is richly dark and will remind you of the Shirley Temple movie \\"The Little Princess.\\" Peter and Tinkerbelle arrive and take the children to Neverland where the skies are turquoise and the clouds are coral colored . Breathtaking fairy lights in the woods were a delight. Remember making hideouts and camps? Then you will love the home of the lost boys. <br />Pretty children, bratty Tink, delightful Peter and a bittersweet story make a great movie. Some scary parts, including the mermaids; this is no Disney cartoon and may be better for older kids. It is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen and I must have it!
B000002UJQ|5.0|while i may not think this is the best radiohead album (Kid A).. ok computer is one of the best rock albums ever! it mixes many things. experimental rock... karma police, airbag, electioneering; slow melodic songs...  the tourist, climbing up the walls. every single song is put in the perfect order, ending the album with &quot;the tourist&quot; (which is perfect!). i love every song on it. even the short-weird &quot;fitter happier&quot; but i love it because its weird and shows how experimental Radiohead can get. but my favourite has to be the six-and a half minute epic - &quot;paranoid android&quot;. and what better way can you tell a story? with songs. my opinion on what OK computer is about...<br />OK Computer, on the other hand, depicts a much more conventional dystopia. Again, this synopsis is only my opinion. OK Computer takes place in our world, but it is a world driven by fear, illusion and conformity. Basically, it begins with the typical citizen, who one day gets into a car crash. In his subsequent coma, he is reborn to a new identity, one not filled in for him by the Party. He is revealed to the absurdity of his existence and the lies under which society lives. This deviation comes to the attention of this society's architect (a Big Brother type character), in Paranoid Android. The citizen is ostracized by his friends for his strange behaviour. He imagines a life beyond what is merely earthbound (Subterranean Homesick Alien). In a parallel to 1984, he finds another who is much like himself, and the two decide to rebel together. Unfortunately, they are arrested by the Karma Police, who deem them heretics and subject the two to mental rehabilitation (Fitter Happier). At this point, things become rather abstract, but in my opinion, the two are reintegrated into society. However, their deviations are merely repressed, and not purged completely, so the citizen becomes erratic and gradually goes insane. Again, only my opinion.
B00009V7RF|4.0|this is a good bep album. i like the fergie addition.<br />the only song on the album i don't like is 'latin girls' <br />luckily i dont need to worry about it, but parents should know that this is not a clean radio edit album.
B0001XAODY|3.0|Hi I really want to know whats on the new on the two upcoming Spider-man Dvds like the Deluxe and the Superbit. I only know the commentary of Tobey Magurire in Super bit is that it how about the deluxe whats on that. I bought my full screen version way back and the extras where bad i wanted to see the other deleted stuff. Can someone please tell me whats all the Hype about.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Amazingly enough, even though this &quot;Best Of&quot; includes 26 tracks, it's still too little for &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;. I'm sure even a casual fan could easily add another 13 track disc to this set. I won't even begin to say what's missing though. I normally like a career spanning selection too, but the early stuff (Syd Barrett years), though it's good, is just too different from the majority of their material, and could have been dropped for more essential songs. But on the bright side, this is all great music, some of it mindblowing really, and is a good collection for fans new or old. In fact, this is almost as good as &quot;The Wall&quot; album.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Many critics consider MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS the single finest Hollywood musical of the 20th Century.  Produced by Arthur Freed, directed by Vincent Minnelli, and sporting a flawless ensemble cast led by Judy Garland, the film was immediately hailed when it debuted in 1944--and time has only added luster to its name.  Now, after several home market incarnations, it at last receives the edition it deserves on DVD.<br /><br />Given its stature, it is ironic that both MGM and Judy Garland originally fought the project.  Based on a collection of autobiographical stories by Sally Benson, the script is little more than a series of domestic adventures in the lives of the Smith family of 1903 St. Louis.  But it became a thing of wonder: a careful balance of sly but gentle humor, a collection of memorable performances, an understated score shorn of the usual movie-musical affectations, and at the center of it all Judy Garland, one of Hollywood's most memorable talents.<br /><br />The transfer is excellent, capturing every nuance of the film's meticulously and beautifully designed sets in full Technicolor; the sound elements, remastered in Dolby 5.1, are equally fine and Garland's unique vocal skills are undimmed by time.  All in all, it seems safe to say that not even the original 1944 theatrical release could surpass the quality of picture and sound offered here.<br /><br />Although the bonus package would have better without the awful pilot for a failed television series based on the film, by and large it offers a superior collection.  Previously available on VHS, the Roddy McDowell-narrated &#34;making of&#34; documentary is worth revisiting, as is the TCM-produced &#34;Becoming Attractions.&#34;  While a number of later documentaries surpass it, &#34;Hollywood: The Dream Factory&#34; has never before been widely available and offers an inside glimpse of the famous 1972 MGM auction.  The Martins' performance of &#34;Skip to My Lou&#34; a reconstruction of &#34;Boys and Girls Like You and Me,&#34; and a collection of Vincent Minnelli movie trailers round out the offerings, all of them entertaining.<br /><br />The notable audio commentary is led by film historian and Garland scholar John Fricke.  I regret to say that I have several issues with Fricke, who seems to rely excessively on Vincent Minnelli's autobiography I REMEMBER IT WELL and who has a tendency to perpetuate certain myths about the film--chief among them the idea that Garland did &#34;The Trolley Song&#34; in a single take.  (Garland prerecorded the song, the overall sequence involves at least seven unique camera set-ups, and although Garland performs most of the solo in a single take there is a change in camera set-up toward the end of her vocal.)  Even so, Fricke offers considerable insight into the cast, crew, and production of MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, and the commentary is laced with remarks (some of them archival) by the likes of Margaret O'Brien, Hugh Martin, and Irving Brecher; in spite of my occasional misgivings, it really is everything one could wish an audio commentary to be.<br /><br />These aside, the bonus package contains a significant and unique prize: the short film &#34;Bubbles.&#34;  Long thought lost, &#34;Bubbles&#34; is one of several shorts made in the early 1930s that include The Gumm Sisters, the youngest of whom would become better known as Judy Garland--a true rarity indeed.<br /><br />Given the beauty of the transfer and the generally exceptional bonus package, it is difficult to imagine a better edition of this uniquely American classic.  I strongly recommend it.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewercollection of Vincent Minnelli movie trailers round out the offerings, all of them entertaining.

B000002HHB|4.0|Being a fan of &quot;10,000 Maniacs&quot;, I was happy to see her release a solo album after she left the band. But I was even happier when I found out how great this disc is, it's absolutely wonderful. The songs are both catchy and moving, and her voice is near perfect. &quot;Tigerlily&quot; also has a number of her more popular songs, including &quot;Wonder&quot;, &quot;Jealousy&quot;, and the excellent first single &quot;Carnival&quot;. But I also really enjoy &quot;San Andreas Fault&quot;, &quot;I May Know The Word&quot;, and &quot;Beloved Wife&quot;. Plus there's &quot;River&quot;, a nice tribute to her friend River Phoenix. Overall a very good solo debut from this former &quot;Maniac&quot;. Every songs sounds as good as she looks.
B0001Z53CY|3.0|D12's second album &quot;D12 World&quot; (2004) is a decent release. To be honest I have never been big into there work, I remember copping there first album and only liking a few tracks. Maybe this comes from me genuinely finding them to be a bit to out there using controversial lyrics to get attention and sell records. I generally dont care if millions buy a record, what matters to me is can I feel it, can I relate to it on some level, and can it get play in the ride. The lead single &quot;My Band&quot; is a somewhat funny track, Eminem's chorus and D12's lyrics make it a different but entertaining track. The video for this cut had me laughing...I think one of the good things about Eminem is he doesnt mind making fun of himself. Alot of early tracks just dont do much for me and fall under skip material, though there are definetly some standout tracks and for me they are &quot;How Come&quot;, the pounding  second single &quot;40 Oz&quot;, and the grimey Dre produced &quot;American Psycho II&quot; feat. Breal of Cypress Hill. My favourite track is  the deep &quot;Good Die Young&quot;, D12 drops an excellent cut while talking about life and death, appreciating each day and remembering those who have past. Maybe this one is my fav because D12 deliver some real relevent lyrics and take things to another level. &quot;D12 World&quot; is a release I would recommend for D12 and Eminem fans. 3.5.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|It has intresting songs on here!<BR>Go pick up a copy!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|In fact, it's not even THAT good!!! I went to see in the theater, and there were four people aside from the other two people I was with. Two of them left 1/2 way through the movie, and I would place money that I heard one of the other persons there snoring. About 2/3  towards the end of the movie the other two people and me started making out loud jokes at the movie, and no one cared. In fact one of the guys in the back was even laughing. This has got to be the worst movie ever. I'm suprised it hasn't made it on Mystery Science Theater 3k already. I lost a dollar bet that it would be on that show before it hit store shelves...no not really, but that would've been a quick way to lose a dollar. After watching the first one, you think, &quot;Wow! That Neo guy is awsome! I hope he doesn't die.&quot; Well bad news, he does. Almost everyone dies! Trinity, and a bunch of people in that human city place. If you have a choice between Star Trek convention, and seeing this movie, do the right thing and go to the Star Trek convention. If anyone was going to die I was hoping it'd be the 'all knoing Morpheus' but he ends up being just fine, so that sucks. He has got to be one of the most annoying movie characters to date, and that's including the Lion from The Wizard of Oz. Oh yeah, play Dark side of the Moon (Pink Floyd) with WoO to see something cool. Also if you play The Wall (Pink Floyd again) with Alice in Wonderland, it's even cooler. That's a better show than Revolutions. They should've stopped after the first one. Plus that animated thing was the most pointless thing ever. It was dumb and boring. Just give up on the Matrix movies right now.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|Ok well we all know this famouse song called &quot;My Band&quot; right well I kinda thought it was ok so when I saw this album at the music shop I said what the hell let me get it there are like 21 tracks on the CD so there probly atleast a few good songs well I was wrong!<BR>This album is a waist of money there is only 3 songs that are ok out of this album which is realy a fail to me in my book.<br />Anyways Im just warning you guy's to not get it cause it's dissapointing....

Jonas , a 12 year old boy who lives in a Utopia ,goes on several adventures . The community has no pain , no memory , no feeling , and no color ! The story really takes on an interesting concept ! It's hard to understand at times , but over all this is my all time favorite book! i never want to put it down !!
B000022TSW|4.0|The genius behind South Park lies in it's ability to take extrememly relevant and current events and turn them in to brutal satire in record time.  No other creators have ever been so fast at taking the latest headlines and turning them into mind bending, 'oh-no-they-didn't-do-that' kind of controversial humor.  This movie does that brilliantly...and with an R rating.  To anyone who lets their kids watch this movie, you should be locked up.  There are so many profane and blatantly offensive lines that one may find shame in watching such a volitile piece of work.  The musical aspect can get on your nerves after a while, but does add more punch to the parody glove when making fun other pop culture icons.  Some aspects are so wrong, or so not right, that you wonder if there is actual satire, or was it just put in for shock value.  Overall, this movie is meant to make you drop your jaw, and in many ways it succeeds.  Surprisingly, it will also make you actually think about the paranoia of parental decency organizations that make mountians out of molehills.
B000000WF0|3.0|How in the world could someone say that The Verve is &quot;shoegazer&quot; music. If u know of My Bloody Valentine, The Boo Radleys (Its alright Forever), Lush, or Swervedriver, then there is nooooo comparison. If this is what you call shoegazer material, then I must've been listening to something completely different. I will be honest to say I've ony heard &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot;, but how far coould they've deviated from this style? Im sorry, there's no matching the lush chords of the former bands I've mentioned.
B00000DGUG|5.0|A great CD. I liked it more than JLP and Under Rug Swept (although URS is a great CD still).<BR>Each track is solid, unique and original. <BR>She's the best singer/songwriter out there, she's cathartic and honest.<BR>Buy it.
0553213105|5.0|I admired Darcy the first time I read this book at the age of 12 and yet now again at the age of 31 after having reread this book, I find myself surprised to experience the same feeling.<br />Yes, he is pretty disagreeable in the beginning, but then I find people who don't intend to impress everyone to be more honest in the long run.  Darcy's character grows on one as one goes forward in the story.<br />As for Elisabeth, she matures remarkably, in general I find the book very realistic , we are all full of pride and prejudice when we meet people and they prevent us from seeing many of their more valuable qualities.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|Not a bad CD at all. Any D12 fan should get this CD. The best songs are undoubtedly How Come and Bitch. It's a good CD overall. <BR>I haven't watched the DVD yet.
B00004VXF2|5.0|I don't know if the entire music-listening world is completely uneducated, utterly oblivious, or simply that much dumber than me, but how can anyone give this record less than a perfect score?  For those fans of Brian Wilson and the lost (and now found) Beach Boys' masterpiece \\"SMiLE,\\" you should be salivating over \\"MMM Part 2,\\" which has harmonies obviously rivaling the Brian/Carl ones, as well as a bass line that could kick Mike Love's behind any day.<BR>For fans of jam-based rock outfits like the Grateful Dead, Phish, or the String Cheese Incident, check out \\"MMM Part 4.\\"  For all the noodling Trey Anastasio does, he never quite gets to the point like Uncle Lou does, and the crescendo is phenomenal.  Besides that, \\"MMMP4\\" makes Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber from the Dave Matthews Band sound like a Barbara Streisand/Kathy Lee Gifford duet.<BR>Anyone who digs punk rock a la the Ramones or the Sex Pistols (or possibly even the Damned) should check out \\"MMM Part 3.\\"  It's got that catchy riff, one that Iggy Pop would've died for back in the early '70s, and even throws a bit of Bowie-esque glam in for good measure.<BR>Finally, \\"MMM Part 1,\\" perhaps the most ambitious piece on the whole record, is also quite easily the best.  Uncle Lou draws on some of the great soul singers of the '60s and '70s--Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin--but creates a sound all his own.  Pete Townshend would've given his little whirlybird thing that he does up just to be able to put this much soul into ANY of his songs (remember, Pete's the one who coined the phrase \\"Maximum R&B.\\"<BR>What's the matter?  Can't hear the stuff I'm talking about?  Oh, I understand.  See, you need to turn the volume up.  Louder.  Louder!  Now sit back and enjoy.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|_L'Auberge Espagnole_  provides a hodgepodge of language (many European languages are spoken in the movie, and three are spoken regularly: French, Spanish and English) as well as a plethora of cultures and lifestyles that provide a wonderful glimpse into modern-day Europe.<br />When Xavier, a French student, sets off for a year in Barcelona, he has no idea what is in store.  He leaves behind his girlfriend, played by Audrey Tautou.  He quickly settles in with a group of international students, representing a number of European nations.  The film shows very little time at the university, so Xavier's life looks like a year-long vacation in the Spanish apartment.  A steamy affair, crazy parties, and lots of sighseeing--is he really in school?<br />One of the best parts of the movie was the cinematography.  The opening scenes depict busy European metropolis life: cars racing, people walking, etc. The film technique fits nicely with the message of the movie.  The cinematographers also show several split screen images that allow the viewer to see the different characters.<br />The casting in this film was splendid, and the characters developed nicely on screen.  The premise sounds very &quot;Real World: Barcelona&quot; but the directors veered away from exploitation in favor of exploration: who are these students?  who are the future leaders of Europe?  Each student in the apartment represented their country, similar to the leaders of the EU.<br />_L'Auberge Espagnole_ is a very special film that should not be missed.
B00018D44U|3.0|I am a big fan of Norah Jones and her musical efforts.  However, this particular album was not what I was hoping for.  Her vocals were just average.  Though she did have some stellar guests assisting her on some of the tracks.  Listening to the album made me long for the vocals that she produced on &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.  This time around the album was not as musically &quot;tight&quot; as &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;.  The band just wasn't up to filling the shoes left by the previous album.  The album was also too twangy and slow for my tastes.  The first album had a much wider mix of slow and fast paced music.  Please listen to the album in the store before you purchase it unless you are diehard Norah fan.

B0001LJCPC|3.0|What is the song that's playing when The Bride and her daughter are laying on the bed watching that movie? Does anyone know? Someone has to know!
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|After hearing My Band I first thought it was funny then I hated it because it was so played.  I didn't really think this cd would be too good based on that but i'm an eminem fan so i bought it anyway.  This is better than Devil's Night.  It boasts an All-Star team of producers in Mr. Porter, Eminem, Dr. Dre, Hi-Tek (of Reflection Eternal fame), Trackstarz, and Kanye West.  Eminem's production has been improving and he does a pretty good job with handling the bulk of the production along with Mr. Porter.  Any way let's get to it.<br />1. Git up (3.5/5) At first this sounded weird to me but after a couple of times it grew on me.  Eminem raps different than his normal style.  It's a club beat.<br />2. Loyalty (4.5/5) One of the best songs on the album.  I really like the hook done Kon Artis' and Proof's verse is fire...but did Obie really say D12 is one of the best groups to have done it?<br />3. Just Like You (2/5)  Not even a great producer like Hi-Tek can save Bizarre<br />4. I'll Be Damned (3/5)<br />5. Dude skit<br />6. My Band (3/5) good comic value but kinda lame<br />7. U R the One (2/5)<br />8. 6 in the Morning (3.5/5) old song i heard this in November.  Eminem's verse is hot.<br />9. How Come (4.5/5) best song on the album all members put in decent verese especially Eminem as usual<br />10. Leave Dat Boy Alone (2.5/5)<br />11.  Get My Gun (3.5/5) nice production by Eminem a little more creative then his normal beat<br />12. Bizarre skit<br />13. Bitch (1.5/5) Em's verse is ok but what a laaaame hook and song.<br />14. Steve's Coffee house skit<br />15. D-12 world (4/5) as usual Kanye drops a nice beat...good song.<br />16. 40 oz.  (3.5/5) different from Eminem.  Bizarre actually sound ok here.<br />17. commercial break<br />18. American Psycho II (4.5/5) solid beat from Dre.  One of the three best on here.<br />19. Bugz 97 rip Bugz<br />20. Good Die Young (4/5) emotional song with a beat that fits<br />21.  Keep on Talkin (2.5/5) old song again this was on mixtapes in the fall...nothing special<br />OVERALL: 3/5<br />Nothing classic but worth the $10 I got it for.  If you like Eminem or Proof pick it up because they clearly outshine everyone else here although Swift, Kon Artis', Kuniva do have their moments....and yes Bizarre still sucks.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|AC/DC is an odd group.  A lot of their songs all have the same beats, but it's a great beat.  High Voltage is AC/DC's first album and it is excellent.  There is not a dissapointing track on this album.  I owned the regular CD release and just picked up the remasterd version today, and I am quite impress.  I have never heard Ac/DC sound better and more crisp.  I am for certain going to pick up more of these re-masters. Great CD, a must have for any rock collection.<br />My top 5:<BR>TNT<BR>The Jack<br />She's got balls<BR>It's a long way to the top<BR>High Voltage
B000148KK2|3.0|Diana's new CD stretches out a bit.  I think it's a transitional work, and we'll see where she goes from here.  As far as the material, &quot;Temptation&quot; is a highlight, as well as &quot;Narrow Delight&quot;.<BR>She shows excellent taste in the artists whose work she covers - Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell, Mose Allison and of course, Elvis Costello.<BR>&quot;Live in Paris&quot; closed a chapter, and &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; starts a new one.  I'm looking forward to hearing her on tour.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Watching both sequels to The Matrix reminds me of something Harlan Ellison said in a review of the first Star Trek theatrical flick.  To paraphrase:  \\"It's a good movie, but not a great movie; we needed a great movie.\\"  (Shades of Joe Biden at the Clarence Thomas hearings.)  As a professional philosopher, I found the quasi-philosophical musings shallow through most of both movies, but, in the end, Neo's \\"I choose to\\" (answering Smith's question as to why Neo should fight a seemingly hopeless battle) was a thinking man's knockout punch.  The battle sequence in Revolutions (in the Dock) was a slam-bang as well.  I was disappointed insofar as the ending seemed like a compromise, leaving the relationship between man and machine a bit muddled (this was foreshadowed, however, in Neo's conversation with Anthony Zerbe in Reloaded), but I suppose, in retrospect, a more simplistic American International Pictures 1950's-style, here-comes-the-army-to-kick-butt ending would have betrayed the series' open-ended questions.  I don't know; I'm still thinking about what I saw.  Maybe that's the point, eh?
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a work of art.  Of course, the story is important.  But you should know how difficult it is to narrate a story of a relationship which begins and ends like this.  Sofia Coppola has done a great job here.  More than that, this film is about the beauty, sadness, and the most important, but fleeting, moments in your life.  Acting is so great.  Bob Harris's personality has been made possible ony by being played by Bill Murray.  And wonderful Scarlett Johansson!  You should check her facial expressions again and again with the DVD.  She is a genius.
B000062YAZ|5.0|yes good cd but not better than tom chapin motherearth
B0001CNRS4|2.0|Hmm let's see where shall i begin...basically to sum it up in a few words. Cliche, unrealistic, fake, bad dance moves and ummm yeah-cliche!
B000002KHH|5.0|Around Christmas I started to get into heavy metal.  I was deciding which CD I should get first.  I listened to Paranoid and I knew I had to have it.  I bought it and it I have to say it is my favorite Sabbath album to date. Ozzy, Geezer, Tony, and Bill really gave Paranoid everything they had.  It includes such classics as War Pigs, Paranoid, Iron Man, and Fairies Wear Boots.<BR>I don't think Sabbath could have put out a better second album.  It also goes for a very reasonable price. So if you are thinking of buying Paranoid, THEN BUY IT!!!  It is so awesome!  By the way, I also highly recommend Sabbath's first album
B000002V07|5.0|Is a great way to describe this cd.  A decade after I purchased it, I still have it in some form of  regular rotation.  Mazzy Star filled a niche in music that no one else to this day has tried to fill.  Some say it is an acquired taste.  I say it is just Mazzy Star.  Hope's voice is hauntingly beautiful, and when entwined with Dave's guitar work, can make you forget about the world around you.  That is a sign of a classic.  Who knows, 20 years form now, teens could be treating Mazzy Star like they admire the Doors now.
0778320448|5.0|Lydia Hoffman has defeated cancer twice.  To celebrate life, Lydia opens A Good Yarn, a knitting supplies store in Seattle. She also teaches a class on knitting.  The first lesson is \\"How to Knit a Baby Blanket\\".<br />Jacqueline Donovan reacts poorly to her son's news that she is to be a grandmother for the first time.  She does not like her daughter-in-law Tammie Lee.  Maybe her bitterness is because she knows her marriage to Reese, a partner in an architectural firm, is dying.  She must make amends with her son Paul so she joins A Good Yarn knitting class.<br />Desperate to become pregnant, Carol Girard joins the class seeking hope that her and her husband Doug's final attempt with in vitro pregnancy succeeds.  This is her last chance to have the child she craves.<br />The court ordered Alix Townsend to do community service as part of her sentencing.  She decides that knitting for the Linus Project should satisfy her case worker.  However, she needs to first learn to knit so she joins the class too.<br />This four diverse women bond in friendship and love as they work on the baby blanket.  Though their individual dreams may not be answered, a group dream forges as each learns the meaning of life.<br />THE SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET is a fabulous deep character study that rotates the narration between the women so that the audience has four subplots that cleverly knit together into a powerful look at the ups and downs  of modern day living.  Though not all dreams are fulfilled and some change for instance to cooking, fans will enjoy Debbie Macomber's strong tale of four females struggling to overcome different setbacks.<br />Harriet Klausner
B00005AREQ|5.0|... Ok I'll admit when this album came out I didnt pay any attention to it, and Im sorry for doing that. For those of you that dont remember blow by blow caused quite a stir among both fans and music critics. And in some ways put Jeff Beck &quot;back on the map&quot; . This was because this album is completely instrumental! In fact the only lyrics are some Frampton style &quot;guitar talk&quot; on a couple of songs. This was considered a very bold thing to do, and if you think about it in some ways doing instrumental music is a little daring. But like Jeff explained hes a guitarist, not a singer...<br />Anyway the attention the album received was equally for its utter brilliance, and again for being a marketing stunt. Thirty years later though blow by blow still stands up very well, and because Beck and his band focused more on composition rather than speed or weird tones, blow by blow really doesnt sound dated at all...<br />Style wise this album has been called jazz/rock and fusion. Which is a little strange (a lot of it sounds more like funk to me). But becareful about who you describe this to as being &quot;jazz&quot;. <br />Anyway as far as the album goes I got to enjoy it recently when a friend let me borrow it. And after hearing &quot;cause we've ended as lovers&quot; I was instantly a Jeff Beck fan. But dont get me wrong the rest of the album is flawless and the only slight low-point is &quot;scatterbrain&quot;. The song is just a little repetitive. <BR> <BR>Bottom line: Get this album!, there is something that you will like about it. Even if you're not a fan get it its a good album and belongs in your music collection!
B000002I2G|5.0|The time was 1969, The Doors were drifting into more of an experimental side.  The Doors had already released one of the greatest debut albums of all time and a stellar sophmore follow up with Strange Days.  The third album was a political staement as much as it hinted at a band becoming risky in the studio.  Jim had turned into a drunken shaman who would prove even more diificult to work with.  Most of the Soft Parade is made up of splices and bits of Morrison's lyrics and poetry with a background of lush strings and jazzy orchestration.  There is the hit single that &quot;touches&quot; everyone and the classic &quot;Wild Child.&quot;  The opus title track that clocks in close to eight and a half minutes is the Doors at their experimental best.  I'm not sure why this album gets such a bad rap, it is not their best but a damn fine album.  When I was back there in seminary school.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Maybe I just missed the whole point here, but I don't really understand why this movie recieved all of the praise it got. When I rented the DVD, I was interested to see what all the hype was about, but it's still beyond me. It was quite  literally plotless. It's a bit like watching a home video of two people's trip to Tokyo. The actors are good, but they have nothing to work with. You wait the whole movie for something to happen, but nothing ever does. It's just a montage of seemingly unrelated scenes. Maybe it's just too artsy for me, but I felt that this movie was a complete waste of time. It was neither entertaining nor amusing. Very much a disappointment.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Dream Theater guys tried really hard to re-issue the &quot;Awake Sound&quot; on this one. So hard that they actually forgot the prog elements. Just a few unusual rhythms and that's all for prog fans. On the other hand, the album is plenty of really heavy riffs. The drumming is outstanding, as always, and J. Petrucci breaks the notes-per-second record with his &quot;pattern based&quot; solos. yeah, the guy can play, that's no surprise for anyone, but this time there's almost no heart on his solos, just technique.<br />Jordan Rudess maybe was on vacation or something else when this album was recorded, where the hell are the keys?, Awake was a great dark album not only because of the seven-stringed guitar riffs, Moore's keys played a major role on that sound. And his lyrics too. <br />So, if you're ok with heavy riffs, and hi-speed guitar solos, this will be great for you, but if you're focused on prog more than anything, go buy King Crimson's &quot;Discipline&quot;, or even Opeth's &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, there's more prog on that one.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is the best movie of all time. Blows Lord Of The Rings out of the water. Kill Bill has everything in it, action, blood, black and white, flashbacks, a great soundtrack, and everything else. Quentin Tarantino went all out with this movie. Kill Bill 2 is the second best movie of all time.
0312962118|5.0|If you're into spy literature and culture, (especially cold war-era Russia) then this is the book for you.  Not only is it rich with clever and exciting clandestine plots and twists but Snow Wolf also gives great attention to character development and an intellectual use of real-life (formally) political figures.  Meade writes a good one with this book by keeping you turning the page as well as instilling an array of emotion into the reader as he takes you from a murder scene to a love story and much more.  Pick this book up for a solid read.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|The new D12 CD is good. If you were a fan of the 8 mile soundtrack and Eminem Show, you won't be dissapointed with this CD. For the most part the beats are good, and the lyrics flow well. Sure there are a couple &quot;dumb&quot; songs, but on every CD that Eminem has ever put out, there are always at least a couple goofy/funny diss songs (&quot;My Band&quot; for one). Don't let &quot;My Band&quot; be the reason you don't buy this CD. This album seriously only has like 3 or 4 bad songs. The producing is amazing like usual, as is the direction of this album. I give it a 5/5.
B00006GFA1|5.0|There are so many great things to say about this album.  First, tracks like No One Knows, God Is In The Radio, Millionare, and Do it Again are amazing.  The only weak track is probably Another Love Song.  Josh Hommes is one of the best guitarists of today.  Him along with Mark Lanegan together is great.  You would probably know Mark from Screaming Trees and Josh from Kyuss.  Dave Grohl is probably the best drummer in existance.  Although lots of people bag to differ.  I would say that Dave Lombardo (Slayer) and Lars Ulrich (Metallica) are the other influencial drummers.  I love the brutal screamings of bassist Nick Oliveri. It really puts me in the mood.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves stoner rock, metal and grunge.
0930289234|3.0|First off, Watchmen isn't bad.  But neither, I believe is it the stunning end-all achievement that it is made out to be.  It's greatest strength, obviosly, is that it's a book of morally ambiguous ideas.  The Watchmen are an assemblage of heroes who's actions are a critique of superhero culture and of the ideas that lie therein.  It is a facinating look at an alternate future, shaped in small ways by the existance of super heroes for both good and evil.<br />Where it falls flat is that it simply feels like it's nothing but ideas.  Consequently the book feels less like a coherant story and more like an aglomeration of ideas and visceral violence.  To be sure, the themes are interesting, but the whole book starts to feel like one of those third rate Heinlein novels that degenerates from storytelling into expostulation about the morality of a world that doesn't exist.<br />Which I guess brings me to my main complaint.  At their best, comic book heroes are a critique and a reflection of the complex morality and themes of the real world.  Instead, Watchmen seems like a critique of a fake world of superheroes, examining a looking glass through another looking glass.<br />In a way, I actually found Moore's 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' to be a more interesting critique, if only because it seems that Moore actually likes the characters from 19th century British Literature, whereas it's pretty clear from his other writings that he doesn't really like or respect modern superheroes.  The character's there have massive flaws, and exist in a complex, morally ambiguous world just like the Watchmen, but somehow feel more real in their anachronistic world than the Watchmen do.<br />Again, I should say that I did like Watchmen.  I just didn't like it all that much.  And even if I did, it really doesn't deserve to be diefied like it is.  It's not peerless, and it does a disservice to other excellent graphic novels in the genre like 'Kingdom Come' and 'Dark Knight Returns' to simply assume it is.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|what an enjoyable movie.  i came to this movie very hesitantly.  my wife was (is) an avid o'brian fan, but i could never get into the books.  she's read them all, but i struggled to even get into the first one.  when the movie came out, though, i took her to it knowing that i would be quite bored but making my wife happy (always a good thing).  <br />instead, i was completely enthralled.  the movie captures the feel of what life must have been like on a tiny boat in the middle of a vast ocean.  the need for discipline, the importance of authority come through so well because that was what held the shipboard society together.  <br />it was little things that really grabbed me:  the men eating on wooden plates, for example.  the unique way of saluting (but the use of either hand to salute was acceptable).  i think this movie captures the feel of that life so well.  <br />some reviewers have griped about the relative lack of plot, and the galapagos subplot.  to me, that seems to be more an effort to keep the spirit of the books alive in the movie.  the stephen/jack relationship is very dynamic because they are friends but jack is ostensibly stephen's superior.  if jack makes exceptions for stephen, he would be violating the chain of authority that holds their ship together.  and yet, stephen's sense of honor is betrayed.  a fascinating thing to me.  <br />so, after watching it in the theater, i did read the first book, and enjoyed it very much.  the movie helped to put the books in context and i learned how to capture the feel of what o'brian is trying to convey.  <br />i rarely buy dvd's, but this was a wonderful exception.  you simply cannot catch everything that goes on by watching it only once.  and i've found the extras in this set to be a wonderful addition to my understanding.  i think the second book is going to be even better after watching this dvd.  i can't wait.<br />i don't know if sequels are planned, but i sincerely hope so.  i want more movies like this.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|first of all i owuld give the album 2 stars but i dont think its that bad but 3 stars almost seems liek too much. okay i was born and raised in Flint, Michigan(like an hour from Detroit, so i LOVE Eminem and i love D12 even more.  But after rushing to Best Buy as soon as i got out of school on Tuesday just to buy D12 World i was a little dissapointed when i popped it in my cd player.  The fist track was good up untill it really began, when i say that i am talking about the &quot;Name Game&quot; intro, that part was good but the rest was only average.  As i moved on in the cd i found myself becoming more and more bored with the lyrical content, comethign that has never ever happened to me when listening to any Eminem or D12 track, starting with Infinite(although i do not want to put Eminem's solo albums in the same building wiht D12's work, because they are, indeed, very bery different).  I thought Devils Night was amazing, is till cant get enough of it to this day. and maybe iw as wrong in looking for some what of the same thing on D12 World.   Now, not to say that i have given up on D12 or that i want my money back because it IS alot better then alot of the other rap in the &quot;new realease&quot; section right now, and i think all of you REAL rap fans know what i am tlaking about.  Al i am saying is that i think that Devils Night seemed like it had some more edge to it and a little more effort.  As it has been said before in previous reviews of this album , it sound sliek they rushed htis album.  Another key signal to me that D12 World was well below the mark i had set for D12, was that, when finished listening to the album i found my self tempted to flip back to &quot;My Band&quot;. and i think that says enough in itself(Eminem/D12 fans know what i am talking about.) But who knows, that is jsut my opinion. I was expecting better, or maybe just different, music from D12 World and i didnt get it.  i still love D12 though and i cant wait for another album!
0385510438|5.0|I have really loved most of John Grisham's books (though he has had some real stinkers) but this book is now my favorite from John Grisham.<br />There are a lot of similarities between this book and To Kill a Mockingbird.  It is a story that took place several decades ago in the Deep South back when black segregation was unfortunately prevalent.  It is a story with a court trial that will show you the character of many residents of Clanton... but the court trial is not what makes this book amazing  (dislike a lot of Grisham novels).  Like To Kill a Mockingbird, the most interesting things about this book are the characters and their reaction to the court trial.<br />The biggest strength of this novel is the character development.  You see how the protagonist, Willie Traynor, grows from a new resident working for a small newspaper to somebody who owns the local newspapers and finds a good fit in a town who generally will not trust you unless they trusted your grandfather.  You fall in love with many of the characters in this book, including Miss Callie, a black woman with a mountain of faith in God and a strong desire to see her family grow up with as many opportunities in life as possible.  She is almost too good to be true, which is her only fault.<br />I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good character book.  The town is rich with a cast of lively resident and the story was nearly impossible to set down.  I really loved this book and I think you would, too!!
0312995423|2.0|Since I couldn't get my hands on the much-talked DaVinci Code, I thought I would try his other books. <br />Digital Fortress is an easy read, but at best it's a weak Michael Crichton. Its plot twists were simply lame, and all the &quot;miraculous&quot; turns to save David Becker's life was just too unbelievable and too convenient.<br />I will still give DaVinci Code a try as people say he gets better, I hope so because Digital Fortress was simply weak.
0345413377|4.0|The first book was fantastic and it slowed down a bit for the second book, though I still loved it.  But the ending to this series was rather disappointing and lacked the imagination that the first two books had.<br />This is the finish to the story of Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry as they fulfill their destiny that has been building up since the first book.  All of the major questions and mysteries are answered in this book, but I still felt rather disappointed.<br />What really brought this story to a screeching halt was the introduction of the mulefa.  While what she learns about them are fascinating, it is hard to keep a book exciting while describing a slow-moving group of creatures.<br />This book wasn't as fun as the other books, and was a lot darker.  As cheerful and fun as the first two books were, this book has got Lyra and Will all grown up, all too soon.  It seems like they've become responsible grown-ups too early and the exhilarating rush of the first two books are missing.<br />This book does leave you hungry for just one more, especially since the ending does not come the way you wish it would.  But if you have read and enjoyed the first two books, then you've got to pick up this book.  It is still wonderful, especially compared to a lot of crap that is out there, but it just wasn't as good as the first two books.
0312263120|2.0|i found the book to be mildly entertaining...<BR>as previous reviews have stated this guys knowledge of computers isn't more than skin-deep (or windows-deep, heh)<br />the plot was fairly predictable and the characters were extermely linear.<BR>i would hope this book is not normal for Dan Brown's work...
0156027321|5.0|This is the story of a 16-year-old Indian boy named Piscine Patel who, while boating from India to Canada, shipwrecks and climbed aboard a lifeboat with a Zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and Richard Parker, an adult Bengal Tiger!!!!  This is the story of how he got there to begin with and his struggle to survive.<br />This is a fantastic read.  It is a lot like \\"Castaway\\" with Tom Hanks except this primarily takes place in a lifeboat and not an island.  There is also a lot of similarities with \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.  Unlike Hemingway, Yann Martel actually makes this story involving, reflective, and interesting.  Yes, Martel beats Hemingway!!!!<br />Like \\"Old Man\\" and \\"Castaway\\", this is a story of survival.  You see the difficulties and hardships that Piscine has to survive in order to see his adventure to the end.  His biggest enemies:  fear, lack of water, lack of food, carnivores (not just animal ones, either), loneliness, and a slowly loosening sense of sanity.  His biggest ally: God!!!<br />I loved this book and would recommend it for anybody looking for something interesting, fun, different, and/or insightful.  Yann Martel creates a wonderful character in Piscine.  He is philosophical and witty throughout the entire book.  It is fun to think, \\"What would I do in his shoes?\\"  This is a great book for readers of all ages!!!  I would highly recommend picking up this book.
B0000029AP|5.0|&quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (the song) is a great rockin' way to kick off the LP, while album cuts like &quot;Uncle Salty&quot; and &quot;No More No More&quot; are songs that will, I mean will, grow on you. Although I got sick of hearing &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way&quot; you won't regret buying this. Tyler's cover of &quot;Stuck out my Big Ten Inch&quot; is very cool as well, but short (lol).
B0001HAHXW|4.0|it's worth the 12 bucks just to hear the song &quot;they're red hot&quot;
B0001EFTVA|4.0|John Ford made this movie twice (as Three Godfathers), once with Harry Carey in the silent days &amp; again with John Wayne in 1948.  It's also been done at least three other times as well.  I love the Wayne version but this one is the best of the bunch.  Funny, warm and ultimately gentle as three homeless people undertake a life changing mission involving a abandoned baby.  The change from three bad men to three homeless people is an inspired one and gives the story &amp; characters room to breath.  Well worth your time.

B000060P79|1.0|I am amazed people older than 14 listen to this [worthless album].  I don't even own the album, but my friend's little sister blares this album every time she gets the chance, so I get subjected to it when I go over to his house.  I mean come on, everyone knows highschool [is bad].  It's not exactly a new subject.  It's almost as non-controversial as writing a song called \\"Gravity Makes Things Go Down\\", and not half as funny either.  I mean come on!  \\"Every Day is the Worst Day Ever\\"?  More like \\"Every Song is the Worst Song Ever\\".  And don't even get me started on their \\"musicianship\\".  I would do better playing guitar, drums, bass, and singing all at once, by myself.  Bands like this actually make me miss N*Snyc and the Backstreet Boys, because at least they didn't pretend to be anything other than sterilized garbage for 12-year-old girls (...).  Of course nothing I do or say will prevent them from selling millions of albums, but at least in another 10 years, when everyone is ashamed of having ever enjoyed this \\"band\\", I'll be able to say \\"I told you so\\".

B000000HSU|5.0|with the ROIR release (and black dots) you get Bad Brains at their blazing, fiery best, without much studio atmosphere- you imagine that's pretty much about how they would sound live... <br />With the Ocasek (the you might think I'm crazy guy from the cars) produced, Rock For Light, you get a slicker, more album sounding album, and a bunch more songs. You decide which you like more, I think Dr. Know's guitar attack-burn cuts deeper on Rock for light. ROIR and Black Dots are all about the punkin attitude and dynamic- Rock for Light is a denser more complicated rendering of the songs. So hands down I go with Rock For Light, even though I love all their albums, excepting Rise and God Of Love.<br />hey- Both CDs easily fit on 1 burned CD, if you get rid of a couple of the reggae tunes (which don't do much for me anyway). Like I said- you be the judge.
B0000026NC|5.0|Just way too cool.  Roger Waters is great, but I don't miss him.  Yes, I think the remaining members have every right to claim the fame of the name Pink Floyd.  Awesome Album.  The Great Gig in the Sky just gives goosebumps.  The arrangements on this album - guitar, keyboards, sax, etc. are consumate Pink Floyd.  I think David Gilmour is an excellent blues vocalist.  Next to Led Zepplin, my all time favorite band.
B000092Q4U|5.0|This is a brutally terrific album by a band that I can confidently say will be one of the forerunners in the future of heavy metal/hardcore music.  From start to finish this album comes at you viciously.  The messages from lead singer Randy Blythe in songs like &quot;Ruin&quot;, &quot;Blood Junkie&quot;, and &quot;Bootscraper&quot; are as painfully inspiring as chaotically sounding.  To be frank, this band does not screw around at all.  They come straight at you with all they have, and I believe that is the future of heavy music.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movies will make you cry, laugh, frown and scream. Love Actually is great. The characters are so real and there is at least one couple you can relate too. I give it 2 thumbs up if I could give 3 then I would.
B000002KOJ|5.0|I love Joni. Clouds is my favorite. Blue and C&amp;S seem to be the most appealing to the majority. With her accoustic guitar perfectly in tune, this self produced album is perfection. Every single song is a winner. I've owned the CD for years but only listened to Chelsea Morning-- until recently. What I'd been missing! To think I'd never even heard That song about the Midway, The Gallery, the haunting Roses Blue et. al., and I called myself a Joni fanatic. The absence of over production only adds to the records beauty. Joni demonstrates that she's a terriffic guitar player-- no piano on this one-- nor funky tuning, just sraight forward and beautiful. Everyone knows she's a great soprano but here she uses it only when needed rather than showing it off. The words to every number are poetic and filled with double entendre. Buy it, listen to it often and then buy it for others. Thanks Joni.
B0001ENY6M|4.0|I'm of two minds when it comes to John Debney. The one considers him an entertaining purveyor of action scores, with the likes of Cutthroat Island and The Scorpion King coming to the forefront. The other remembers The Relic and every other forgettable score he's done just to pay the bills. <br />These two minds were warring with each other when I first heard Debney was doing one of the more controversial films of of the... century?... all time? Why put a film like this, whose score would no doubt need the touch of a master, in the hands of a composer who is at best hit-or-miss?<br />His last track to the score, the brilliant &quot;Resurrection&quot;, put my fears to rest. This man is a thematic genius, and has capably invoked Christ's ultimate departure from the tomb with such emotion that I get a rush every single time I listen to it. The rest of the score is secondary to me, compared to this last piece of music, it simply fills the void. <br />For a film that woefully glorified Christ's torture and death and only touched upon the miracle of His resurrection, John Debney took those few seconds and turned them into one of the most memorable themes he, or any other composer, has ever produced.
B00003CXSP|3.0|MINOR SPOILERS: Book and novel <br />It can be said that &quot;Hannibal&quot; is only loosely based on Harris' book. Not because it is that different plot-wise or because certain characters are omitted (like Mason's sister) but because the two central characters, Agent Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter, couldn't be more apart from how they are portrayed in the book.<BR>The film makers never bother giving Hannibal a raison de etre (other than staying alive and free), or explain his man-eating ways. In the novel, his little sister Mischa is literally eaten alive by deserting soldiers during the end of WW II. As Hannibal grows older, he decides that God is the ultimate killer and none of his own indiscretions could match those of the Maker. That is his *justification* for killing and eating human flesh. The motive is as disturbing as ever but you actually feel some degree of sympathy for the little boy who found his sister's milk teeth in the stool of her tormentors. <BR>Although Hopkin's delivers a fine performance as usual, you can't help but feel that he's almost parodying his famous role from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Lines that are meant to sound chilling (&quot;I'm giving serious thought...to eating your wife&quot;) are delivered with comic timing that would befit a black comedy. <BR>Then there's Julianne Moore. I personally felt that Jodie Foster *nailed* the part of Clarice Starling, right down to that country cornpone accent. Tried as I might, I couldn't see Julianne Moore in her shoes. Her accent is too cosmopolitan, her manner too aloof. <BR>And on another point, the novel does a good job of exlaining *and* developing the relationship between Hannibal and Starling. He *does* get inside her head, they both have much in common being orphans and their acquaintance blossoms into a relationship. In the movie, it seems quite pointless. You are left wondering why she would let the most famous serial killer in the world go. Or why he didn't eat her liver with some fava beans? <br />But Hannibal does have some redeeming qualities. It's a quite excellent horror film. There are scenes that have rightly attained notoriety. I won't spoil those for you. So go on, get your cheap thrills here. Just don't read the book first (if you haven't already).
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Hey...how's about you go and rent some Michael Bay or Ron Howard movies okay? A real film buff who appreciates not only the art of film, but beautiful photography and terrific acting, will like it. Maybe it's a bold statement but I'll say it again, if you didn't like this movie then you should just stop watching them. Simple as that.
B0001Z363W|5.0|I stumbled upon Book of Shadows(BOS) when it first came out and bought it on a whim.  It became a CD that really spoke to me and alot of other fans.  Initially, I liked a couple of songs but over time each song became a treasure of soul and emotion.  I listened to it consistently over the next 3 years and have since made my own Zakk Wylde CD from all of his Acoustic work(Pride &amp; Glory, BOS, BLS) that stays in my CD player.  I have highly anticipated every Zakk/BLS release since.  Longtime fans have been calling for another Acoustic album since that time.  To me Zakk has answered the call and has given another brilliant piece of work for all of us to enjoy.  I personally love the mix of Acoustic/Electric guitar and piano.  The way Zakk can control his voice from high to low or from soft spoken to a wail.  Yes, from some of the reviews you can tell this is a major departure from Black Label Society's(BLS) recent work.  It was promoted on his record label website as, &quot;an album that will turn all preconceptions of Zakk Wylde and BLS firmly on their head&quot;.  That is true but only if you have not been exposed to BOS.  Let me say this all of the BLS albums are awesome as well!  Sonic Brew and Stronger than Death are my favorites.   Again, I have also compiled my own best of BLS CD.  Take the negative comments with a grain of salt.  Alot of fans will begin to complain at some point if an Artist continues to put out the same type of CD everytime and does not diversify.  I would suggest picking up Book of Shadows as well under the name of Zakk Wylde not BLS to know where the origins of Hangover Music came from.  My thanks to Zakk for another masterpiece I will be listening to for years to come.   JD   (SDMF Va Chapter)
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I barely sit through the whole movie, and actually forced myself to keep watching to see what's there - `cause nothing much there. It's just a mediocre movie, so does Sophia's talent. I can see that she was telling some self-experiences in a slow-paced narrative way, trying to paint a beautiful cinematography, trying to add a little humor, sometimes by trying to ridicule Japanese... well, I can see the trying, but not so much of the result...<BR>I don't see much plot to hold the movie; I don't see much chemistry developed by the two people; I couldn't feel any empathy at all for the character, the empathy that a movie usually brings out of audience. I wonder how she won the best screenplay `cause the flow of the movies feels a little choppy. You can't just tape some scenes in real life, and piece them here and there in the weak flow of the whole movie... <br />I guess maybe Hollywood usually honor the family tradition by giving her so much recognition, or Hollywood overall is sliding toward mediocre... it's not a bad movie, as a matter of fact, it's interesting to an extent if you want to see some foreign culture. In a word it's just a mediocre one... b.t.w. If I were a Japanese, I'd been a little unhappy about the depiction of Japanese backdrop/culture `cause the director only pick sth on the surface and sometimes trying so hard to ridicule it in order to add the humor to the movie, but nevertheless without much success.
0385336810|5.0|It's light, fun, and totally entertaining.  No deep plot, no bio-terrorism or horrific religious scandal.  Just a breezy and funny slice of life as seen through the eyes of Sophie Kinsella's newest heroine, the endearing Emma Corrigan.<br />Already a white-knuckle flyer, Emma goes to pieces when her flight from Glasgow to London encounters severe turbulence.  Thinking the end is near, she spills every secret she has ever had to the stranger next to her.  How she lost her virginity, what she really thinks of her boyfriend, the petty stunts she pulls on co-workers, the way she killed her parents' goldfish while they were on vacation and replaced it without their knowledge, her deepest thoughts on g-strings, cousins, Charles Dickens, and more.  When the plane miraculously lands, Emma is thankful she will never again see this man who knows every little secret of her life.<br />Emma returns to her job as a junior marketing executive and as she attempts to climb the corporate ladder, every embarrassing secret of her life is exposed.  How Emma combats this public humiliation and discovers another person's secret makes for a rollicking good read.<br />Emma is very reminiscent of Kinsella's other heroine, the shopaholic Becky Bloomwood.  Equally appealing are Emma's two flatmates---her life-long friend Lissy and the irrepressible Jemima who will have you laughing hystericaly at her thoughts on men, jewels, and all things fashionable.<br />This is a quick and fun read, sure to satisfy fans of the Shopaholic series or chick-lit in general.

0790731924|4.0|The engaging chemistry of Mel Gibson (Martin Riggs) and Danny Glover (Roger Murtaugh) continues into LETHAL WEAPON 2 as they take on a South African drug kingpin, Arjen Rudd(Joss Ackland). He also happens to be a South African diplomat with immunity to any type of persecution. So, Riggs and Murtaugh harrass him and his henchmen, playing a lethal cat and mouse game of picking off each other from both sides.  A key witness Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) stands in the middle of all the carnage and the carnage mounts.  Practically everyone from Riggs' and Murtaugh's precinct (detectives, officers and what have you) are eliminated... even the female lead/love interest to Riggs-(Patty Kensit) is oft in the proceedings.  It seems the only ones left alive are Riggs and Murtaugh (it was reported that Shane Black's original screenplay was to have Riggs killed at the end) to take on the South African drug cartell. Even with the body count, the film is very entertaining due to Gibson and Glover's characters, a witty script, and the direction of Richard Donner (SUPERMAN-THE MOVIE, THE OMEN) who seems to have a fond affection for the two characters since he's directed all four films. The film franchise probably &quot;perfected&quot; (not invented)the buddy cop genre (forerunners: SUPERCOPS, FREEBIE AND THE BEAN, RUNNING SCARED) and is the &quot;yardstick&quot; for others that haven't come close (i.e. TANGO AND CASH...?). Lastly as the final credits roll in LW2, George Harrison's great song CHEER DOWN plays.  Perhaps because guitar god/legend Eric Clapton did part of the muscial score for the film, he got pal Harrison to contribute the song.  The song sounds very much like a James Bond-type tune and perhaps was inspired by the nature of the film. When the film is shown on network televison, its too bad the song is always drowned out by programming or commercial announcements (notoriously and especially on TNT and TBS).  On cable, DVD, and video, the song can be heard in its entirety.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I went to theatre twice for this movie - something I've never done before for any movie, I bought the soundtrack immediately afterwards, and I bought the DVD first day it is available. That's how I LOVE it ACTUALLY.<br />The movie is a romantic fantasy for mature adult, a stylish medley of many unrealistic love stories. Some people dislike it because of the unrealistic plots, but could you just lighten  your \\"seriousness\\" for a moment and enjoy some heart warming fun and laughter? If you could, this movie is your best bet - superb casting, amazing music compilation. I leave the theatre with a smile, a sense of happiness - what more can you expect from a movie?<br />Richard Curtis is THE king of romantic comedy, I loved every pieces of his work way back from the Four Weddings and a Funeral to this one.<br />Love Actually will be a all-time Christmas classic to be viewed for generations to come.
B00005JMH2|5.0|This is a potentially a great movie about a bored Chicagolawyer(Richard Gere)who takes ballroom dancing lessons with his instructor (Jennifer Lopez), whose wife (Susan Sarandon)suspects him cheating on her.This movie's plot is similar to the superb original Japanese version made a few years ago.It should be very well watching,when it's released!!
B0001ENY6M|4.0|First of all I will say that I am only going to do a review of the recording of the soundtrack. I am not going to try and review the film, which I have to admit I have not seen as yet.<br />The music John Debney has composed for the film &quot;The Passion of<br />The Christ&quot; tries and succeeds in evoking a different time and place from the present. This is one of a number of soundtracks that seem to be trying to do homage to the soundtracks composed in the late Fourties and early Fifthties. It also itroduces the listener to sounds that are not usually heard in traditonal Western music. Apparently Mr. Debney and company did their homework on what sounds would be right for the film. The only complaint I have with the soundtrack is that there are some chants that I assume have words to them, it that is true, why not<br />add a short libretto to the booklet. Or add the words to the movie's web site. I must also say that I was reminded of other recent soundtracks such as the ones Howard Shore composed for the Lord of the Rings movies. All in all the music score is a haunting one and a beautiful one. Hopefully we will get to hear more from Mr. Debney again soon.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|What the hell happened to the plot?  At the end of the 2nd movie, we're left with interesting clues to how the Matrix came about, and it's clear that there is more to be revealed.  And what happens?  They ignore all of that in favor of an action movie that has no action and no suspense?  Why add on lame characters in an attempt to tug on our heartstrings?  After all of the interest and mystery of the Merovingian, Persephone, Agent Smith, Seraph, the Oracle, and the Keymaker in the 2nd movie, why abandon all of that for the last movie?  This could have been an interesting movie where they tie together the clues in the 1st and 2nd movie and paint a cohesive picture of the world of the matrix and how it came about.  Instead they left all of that behind.  This was a waste of money.  Totally unforgivable moviemaking.
B0000001PW|5.0|Maybe this album hits all the jazz-rock fanatics in the world. Partially because chick can compose far more  smoothly and imaginatively than any other musician in the world.His pitch bend play appeals to the fans of JAN HAMMER.Moreover his approach to computerized sound is well designed and percussive enough to inspire my soul and ears.High Tech conscious ,heavy fusion listeners must hear this at any rate.This is a real masterpiece of JAZZ ROCK COMBINATION.
B0000C8AVX|1.0|Rising Talented Star, could use a little polish and vocal lessons. <br />I saw this on sale at Sam Goody, and since I still had a couple of dollars after purchasing the latest and greatest from Saliva, I decided to give this new fad of singer songwriters a chance. <br />I was put off by his lack of originality in lyrics. I mean, come on, almost all of his tracks were already done by much better artists such as: The Gin Blossoms, Five For Fighting, and the timeless Toad the Wet Sprocket. <br />If only he took a note from the Limp Bizkit, perhaps he could learn a thing or two about heart-felt songwriting.
1400034779|3.0|Light-hearted reading.  Very cute, very different cadence to the narrative.  Enjoyed it.  Not a strong plot, especially if you like page turners.  This book meanders like a collection of short stories.  America-bashing while glorifying Botswana.  I guess readers have a love affair with Africa and I think that's why this book gained great reviews.<BR>There was a lot of male-bashing, but some good guys too, though expressed more subtly. The characters are entertaining, but again the plotlinein this book is dull. The novel is just barely worth reading for the pleasant local color, but as far as mystery fiction goes, I would rather reread Ellis Peters, Anne Perry, Elizabeth Peters, or Cynthia Peale. <BR>The back cover led me to expect &quot;the case that tugs at her heart, and lands her in danger, is that of a missing eleven-year-old boy, who may have been snatched by witch doctors.&quot;  What?!  Where?!  The missing boy case was a teensy part of the book, and certainly did not tug at my heart strings at all.  There was barely anything made of it at the end.  I would have liked to see at least two of the stories to be tied together, or for some clue from another case to help solve the case of the boy's disappearance. Nothing like that is part of the book.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Amy Pumpkins fan knows the truth.  Anyone who's ever seen the Pumpkins live pre and post Jimmy knows that &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; was NOT all played by Billy on all instruments.  Jimmy has a signature style on drums that is unmistakable.  Jimmy is the greatest rock drummer of his generation, all problems aside.  It is clear to anyone that has an ear that Jimmy is the force behind Siamese Dream and Billy has given him the credit time and time again.  Jimmy is the power of Pumpkins.  Billy is the inspiration.  Siamese Dream is one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  If you didn't get a chance to see them live then check out Zwan.  Zwan is a different style and great on its own, but the drumming of Jimmy remains the same - F*ing outstanding!  Lyrically, Siamese Dream stands on its own and is all Billy.  This is an album that you can listen to over and over again and always find new meaning.  Add it to your collection.  I'm thankful again and again that I have it it mine.  I'm grateful for over a decade of great music.  This was the climb to the top and the pinnacle all in one release.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I absolutely love all of Quentin T.'s films. \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\" is just as exciting and fiercely entertaining as I suspected it would be.<br />I can remember reading about the making, and how it was originally going to be one long movie instead of cutting into two films.  The idea of this story peeked my interests, but I unfortunatly waited til it was on dvd to see it. If it is shown on big screens again,  I have to go.  This is definitely a film that should be seen BIG.<br />With it's cartoonish blood, fight scenes, revenge filled plot, and awesome soundtrack, \\"Kill Bill\\" delivers a true homage to a variety of movie genres.<br />Starring Uma Thurman as our vengeful Bride, who was left for dead on her wedding day, who kicks butt clear across the entire movie.  It is really quite a spectacle to see.<br />One thing I couldn't quite get over was that the actor playing \\"BUck\\", who seems to always play a jerk of all trades, played the boyfriend in \\"Valley Girl\\".  While that doesn't do anything to tell you whether or not to view this extremely fine film, it's a bit of trivia for ya.<br />I am highly recommending this one! It's truly a great show.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is no doubt one of the best albums in my entire collection.  As a musician, the level of creativity is truly amazing. I have heard some people say that parts of it sound cheap or poorly recorded. These people are missing the point. Everything that Radiohead is...is anything but the ordinary. It is not supposed to sound like the newest American Idol recording or something that is so over-produced as to take away the spontaniety of it all. Part of the genius of this album is its sort of trashy sound in places. The reason this works is because there is a sort of dynamic balance over the length of the cd...a sort of equal contrast. For instance, the transition from Climbing Up the Walls into No Surprises provides an amazing contrast and it is moments like these that make the cd. The only problem I have is with all of these people who have probably jumped on the bandwagon with Thief. I am really happy that people are getting into this band and I encourage it, it is just hard to see people buy their stuff and, without really even knowing the history of the band, just start writing these crazy &quot;not enough stars&quot; reviews.  I have been listening to this band since about a year after their release of Pablo Honey, which was released in early '93 if I remember right.  I agree with everyone saying that this band is one of the best of our generation and that OK Computer is one of of the best albums of the '90s, because they are and it is. I have come to truly appreciate this band over the years and listening to OK Computer takes me back to being about 16 or 17 when I was just getting into playing my own music. They truly have been an inspiration to me and my playing. That is all I have to say, just be sure you don't jump on the bandwagon because it is the cool thing right now or because their stuff is extremely well reviewed by critics because though they deserve every bit of it and more, they don't deserve to be the latest fad. :)
B000002J0B|2.0|I've always been amazed that people laud this album and slag-off on the FAR superior Presence.  Not only does this disc hold the two worst Zep tunes: the silly \\"The Crunge\\" to the HORRID faux-reggae of \\"D'yer Mak'r\\" ,the rest is mediocre at best. \\"The Ocean\\" is fluffy filler and only \\"No Quarter\\" holds any real interest, thanks to Page's fuzzy guitar riff, and even that struggles to hold the song together for it's length.
B0001HAISG|5.0|For the first time in my life, I got the message of the story.  The kids did a spectacular job.  The theatre audience gave a standing ovation at the end.  Kids under school age got scared, but all other kids and adults should love all of it.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|I have to agree with a lot of Weezer fans that the blue album really is their best CD. But by re-releasing it with the b-sides that we all hunted so feverishly for in the internet, they made it so much better! I remember how badly I wanted those songs, and now they're here!<br />So you get the great quality of the blue album plus all the b-sides you've been looking for. It's wonderful!
0743454529|5.0|... this book is trully amazing! I have read all of Picoults books, and although this one follows the same plot basis, it is exceptionally wonderful to the others. From the beginning all the way to the twists at the end. I could not stop turning the pages. It flows beautifully through everyones perspectives. I recommend this book to anyone. It will open your heart. Just keep a fresh tissue box at your side. Enjoy.
0385510438|3.0|The protagonist of this book is Willie Traynor, a young man fresh from college who, with the help of his wealthy grandmother, purchases a newspaper, The Ford County Times, in Mississippi. It is 1970 and all is quiet until a local woman is raped and murdered. Now a trial is set to begin with a member of the notorious Padgitt family. The jurors are selected, one of them being the first black female to serve and also a dear friend of Mr. Traynor. The trial is heavily covered in the paper, increasing the sales to Willie's delight. When the convicted, Danny Padgitt, is senctenced to life in prison, the town relaxes...except for those that understand that a life sentence doesn't necessarily mean he will remain in prison for life.1 Tension mounts years later when he is released on parole and deaths occurr once again in the town.<br />Mr. Grisham is back to writing about the courts and laws, the things I love to read by him. But this book doesn't stick to just the courts. It's more of a mixture between his action packed earlier books (such as The Firm) and his later, low-keyed home town books (such as A Painted House). He spends a great amount of time exploring the lives of various characters, sometimes giving more detail than needed. I found myself becoming bored in spots, wishing for more excitement with Danny Padgitt.
0440211727|5.0|This may be the best book I have ever read, and that's saying a lot. Grisham is a master of the courtroom drama, and he proves that with this book. A Time to Kill had everything, suspence, action, and drama. FOR ANY GRISHAM FAN, A MUST READ!!!
0060930187|5.0|Personally, I could relate to this book in so many ways. I could understand the frustration that Esther felt as she struggled to deal with the pressures of society despite her own feelings of inadequancy. After an attempt of suicide, she is placed in a hospital where she is isolated from the norms of society. While there, she learns that she does indeed have inner strengths and the ability to cope. She emerges from the hospital ready to face the world head on.<br />This book brings even more meaning with the knowledge that the author, Sylvia Plath, dealt with many of the same issues in her own life. It has been speculated that she wrote this book more as an autobiography rather than a work of fiction because of the many similarities. But tragically, rather than gaining courage and strength, Sylvia Plath committed suicide not long after this book was published. It's almost as if this book was her cry for help, a plea that went unanswered.
0618001905|5.0|This is a must read if you are at all interested in Africa and the atrocities commited there.  Normally i don't like history books, but after reading the introduction I was hooked. it is very easy to read, and reads like a novel. It is a history of King leopold's Congo, how came to be and how it was brought down by the hard work of a few individuals that created a world wide mouvement to stop him. The book discribes in detail the horrors that occured and how the people of the Congo were mistreated. Hochschild has a way of bringing the charachters to life through revealing their past and showing them as real human beings as opposed to one dimentional characters from history. In the beging of the book he discribes the history of the Congo, and how King Leopold aquired it. In the second half of the book he shows how his rein was pulled down by the first major humanitarian effort of the last century.
038533348X|5.0|It took some patience in the beginning; but with such an acclaimed author, I had to keep reading and was well rewarded in the end. This book has everything : humor, love, mystery, sci-fi, and religion. The protagonist of the story starts out on a mission to write a book about the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan and the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. Hoenikker. He becomes completely immersed in the lives of the Hoenikker family and joins a religious cult, whose fundamental beliefs are based on lies. Vonnegut is so obscure; thus rather than clearly stating facts, many important points of this story are magically dispersed throughout the background. Despite the fantastic chain of events that lead to the conclusion of this tale, Vonnegut's insightful revelations concerning the nature of humanity may be enough to convince the reader that quite possibly fate has already determined the destiny of the world. Well done.
B000002UDB|5.0|Number 1 for eight consecutive weeks upon release,and boasting 3 number 1 singles to its credit,this is yet another 5 star blast from the gods of music! Simply flawless from the opening track to the last... simply incredible!!!
B000063UR2|4.0|I might be one of the few people who didn't like the director's cut of this film more than the US theatrical version.<br />The basic story is about a princess named Lily (Mia Sara) and a forest boy named Jack (Tom Cruise) who are in love, but are split apart when they have to go on a quest to save the world from being taken over by the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry).  Unicorns are the source of light, and the Lord of Darkness wants to have them all killed.  Jack and several fairies go to rescue both Princess Lily and the unicorn when they are captured by the evil Lord.<br />Having never seen the movie before, I didn't realize there would be such a difference between the director's cut and the theatrical release.<br />I watched both in the same day, with the D.C. being the first version I saw.  I felt like the scenes were too dark (in a visual way, not content), Lily's singing to the unicorns was annoying, and, honestly, I thought Jerry Goldsmith's score was way over done.  I'd always been told that the music was light, New Age, and very '80s.<br />Then I saw the original US version.  I thought it was so much better!  Although some cool scenes were cut (Meg admiring herself in the shield), I thought the end with Jack and the unicorn was better explained, the scenes were easier to see, and the music was great.  The feeling of this version was much lighter and the story was easier to follow.<br />Overall, I would say this movie is very enjoyable, but the version you watch will give you two very different experiences.<br />  I disagree with the people who say the theatrical version felt choppy; I think the director's cut flowed much more poorly.  The music, too, plays a major part in the feeling of the film.  Jerry Goldsmith's orchestra makes the movie seem overly-epic and can drown out scenes, while Tangerine Dream's soundtrack seems more mystical and light.<br />Though I like the US theatrical version the best, both movies should be watched to get the full effect of this great fairy tale.  As a whole, the characters are fun, the costumes and scenery are well done, and the battle between purity/goodness and Tim Curry's evil (he always makes the best villains!) is a classic tale you shouldn't miss.tale.

B00015YVDG|5.0|RANSOM is probably Ron Howard's most fully realized film to date.  Howard helms a tense, literate script, without letting its potential maudlin come through.  Mel Gibson, who has &quot;ruined&quot; his career with the 350 million dollar+ gross of THE PASSION OF CHRIST (Notice tongue in cheek, folks) shows us what a powerfully commanding actor he can be.  His role as the tortured, yet committed, father is beautifully performed.  Mel doesn't parlay his looks into establishing his popularity.  The Australian is a very good actor, and in some ways, has never been recognized for the fact.  Rene Russo is amazing, too.  Starting off in a cool, I've got things under control aura, she melts into a desperate, crazed, and passionate woman who loves her husband dearly, but can't believe he's risking their son's life.  Gary Sinise once again brings a mercurial sense of villainy to his role as the mastermind behind the kidnapping, and his coldhearted murders only enforce his psychosis; Delroy Lindo as the head FBI agent gives a sturdy, tense and compassionate portrayal; Lili Taylor is devastating to watch as she crumbles under the pressure of her part in the kidnapping, but her cold hearted willignness to kill the little boy is frightening; Liv Schrieber and Donnie Wahlberg as the brothers are convincing, in view of their relatively little time on screen.<br />I liked this film a lot because it touched my emotions in the way a thriller of this type should.  Nail bitingly good, it's one of Gibson and Howard's best works.
0743243153|5.0|When I first read this book ten years ago, I was too young, immature, and inexperienced with life that I did not think much of it and didn't understand why so many people liked it. I reread this book a couple of weeks ago and it finally hit me! I finally see the many things going on around me much clearer. I then read &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato and things became even more clear (especially things about my relationships). I highly recommend both of these books to people who have reached a certain maturity level in mid-late adulthood. If you encounter them at he right stage, they might initiate a major transformation in your emotional and spiritual growth process. Happy reading!
B000000OSG|5.0|&quot;Use Your Illusion 2&quot; shows G N'R as a band that can do more than just play hard and fast. With songs like &quot;Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Estranged&quot;, and &quot;Locomotive&quot; Axl proves that he can really write lyrics. No since Jim Morrison has anyone written lyrics this good. I don't think any album from any band will ever be greater that &quot;Use 2&quot; My all time favorite song however is &quot;November Rain&quot; from &quot;Use Your Illusion 1&quot;. There is only one thing left to say if you are a rock fan, and have not yet heard this album... You are a sinner. Buy it. Listen to it... Again and Again, and again...
B000148KK2|2.0|This CD is a let down to core fans of Diana Krall. She has walked away from her listener base in favor of an exploratory concept in music. Too bad she has left her jazz standard abilities on the sidelines for music to satisy her intellectual curiosity. It's not like they ran out of standards for her to perform for the next 20 years. Bottom line, stick to your knitting, Diana, and dont walk away from the listeners that helped make you.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Nu metal has never been a successful genre of music. I mean, in the big scheme of things, manipulating the masses isn't in anyone's best interest. Our &quot;music industry&quot; promoting the genre is all based on trends, and trends are just as overrated as Slipknot is. Teen angst, stupid lyrics and whiny vocals, repetitive and simple guitar structures; every clich in nu metal can be found in this band.
B0001L3MI0|1.0|This is one of those big stupid movies that people hate and for good reason.  It's big, loud and stupid.  The town drunk is a hero for no reason.  People punch aliens and sass em!  People fly alien spaceships like they drive cars.   Aliens (from outer space) use Apple computers!  Oi! This movie hurts my head.  <br />Oh yea, the president can fly an f-18 why not.<br />I kept routing for the aliens thru the whole movie.  I hope this new DVD has an ending where the aliens win and kill everyone.   I cheered in the theater when they started blowing up things.<br />Beethoven wrote the score to this movie.  It went \\"Crap crap crap craaaap.  Crap Crap  craaaaaaaaap\\"
B000002UAR|5.0|It's hard to say which of the Beatles albums is the best, but this one commonly tops most people's lists. One thing is certain in my book: this is the first psychedelic Beatles album (Rubber Soul is more folk-rock than psychedelic and it also happens to be the first great Beatles album). A drug-induced haze seems to float through the whole album from the lethargic &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; to the dabblings in Indian music with &quot;Love You To&quot; to the dreary &quot;She Said, She Said.&quot; Even the album's arguably most famous and most unfairly mocked song, &quot;Yellow Submarine,&quot; has the surreal imagery typically associated with being affected by drugs, even though the Fab Four claimed it was simply their attempt at a children's song. For the message of this album, just look at the eleventh song on the album, &quot;Doctor Robert.&quot; The story behind this song details the work of a real doctor in New York who the Beatles knew. This doctor would prescibe drugs as &quot;treatment&quot; for his &quot;patients,&quot; who included the Beatles. Sample lyric: &quot;Doctor Robert, you're a new and better man, He helps you to understand, He does everything he can, Doctor Robert.&quot; It's almost as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo are trying to use this album to show non-drug users just how it feels like to be on drugs, sending you on your own personal acid trip. And what a great trip it is. The songs are probably the highest quality songs the Beatles wrote in their short history, with each song ringing exactly as they most likely intended, which is perfect for us. The process they took through the studio would also be a great starting point for future albums of theirs which opened doors in the field of studio-based art-rock. The highlight of the album comes in the form of their only true LSD song, the album closer, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot; This song is psychedelia in its truest form, devoid of all other forms of thought. Glitchy backward guitarsounds, swirling vocals, every sound imaginable comes through in this Lennon masterpiece. This song proved the perfect song to close the album that practically began the era of psychedelia by pushing the ideas out to the world. Cliched phrase that works here: music would never be the same.
0780021150|5.0|While watching this story unfold, I found myself on quite a rollercoaster ride of emotion. First, I hated Beckert (Peter Lorre's character) for luring innocent little girls to their hideous deaths. Beckert is scary due to his ordinariness, his gentle face and small stature. He's the opposite of what we tend to expect (even today) a child molester / killer to look like. I really wanted this guy caught! I cheered for the cops to nail this maniac at all cost. Then, I wanted the underworld types to nab him and dole out their version of justice (regardless of their selfish, criminal motives). The scenes of the crooks surrounding / hunting Beckert in a deserted office building are paranoic and intensely claustrophobic. I could feel the terror in Beckert's head. No longer the predator, he was now the prey. Once caught, he is taken to a deserted brewery and put on &quot;trial&quot; by the crime bosses. Beckert must plead for his life before a mob that's not all that interested in his side of the story. He delivers one of the most desperate pleas for mercy in movie history to an audience concerned only with his destruction. Just as the mob leaps at him to tear him apart, the cops arrive, becoming Beckert's (temporary) salvation. In the end, we are left with the words of one of the victims' mother. She sadly states that while Beckert may die for his crimes, this will not bring her baby back to her. Such is the great paradox of justice. Fritz Lang gives us quite a lot to think about in this legendary tale. Buy it and see what I mean...
B0000028RR|5.0|RATM has the right as american citizens to express their opinion about whatever the crap they want. Like you and I, they and we have the right to replace our government as a people if we as a people feel that in any situation our govt. has become corrupt or otherwise insufficient. Just because they sing and talk about some of the things that strike a nerve in you, that is no reason for you to lash out and attack a group of musicians who are simply expressing their right to voice their opinion about our government, or whatever political opinion they have. how would you feel about someone making judgement on your right to express your opinion, because I just have, and it is my constitutional right to do so. So in the future, just keep your criticisims and judgements to your self, and think about exactly what you're saying, and how it actually applies to the topic/situation you're discussing. Because you are more or less doing, in a very inadiquate way minus the jammin' music and eloquent verse of one Zach de la Rocha and Co., what ratm have done to establish themselves as front runners in the alternative music scene.
B00003CXP1|4.0|In most movies made today, drug abuse is glamorized and treated as an acceptable and often comical part of the times. This is not one of those movies. Though making an 'anti-drug' film is nearly impossible these days aside from some rediculous after-school special, this film dares to fly in the face of convention and portray a realistic picture of the awful effects of addiction. Every kid in America over the age of 13 should see this movie-- the director's cut, not any edited version!<br /><br />It is truly sad as one follows the characters' lives as they sink to one unimaginable low after another, unable to think beyond where their next fix is coming from. This overshadows even the strong sexual content, which serves only to make the characters' plight all the more pathetic. Do NOT hold out for a happy ending.
B00000JSJC|1.0|This movie is absolutely horrid. There is constant violence including sexual assaults against women. I agree with another viewer that found it odd that a woman would choose to direct this type of film. If you enjoy watching nothing but violence and seeing women hurt, then this film is for you. I wonder what James Cameron was thinking when he wrote this piece of garbage.
B000099T2L|5.0|I absolutely love the song Baby Boy with Sean Paul. This is the best song. Although her song with her Fiance Jay Z is another good song, Crazy In Love. I heard Destiny's Child Is Getting back together to make another album. So I wish them luck.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|In the early seventies, there was a sitcom called \\"Love American Style\\".  Its format consisted of a few vignettes of couples in love.  The stories were sometimes cute, and the endings were happy.  <br />Writer/Director Richard Curtis took the same idea but juggled 5 to 8 (I lost count) segments that vary a lot in tone, from farce to literate and endearing, all in the running time of a commercial movie.  When most movies have difficulty doing 1 love story well, Curtis risked confusing his audience with so many characters and story lines that I think some deserved more development or movies of their own.  It's an adult romance at a time when studios make much more money with teenage romances.  He assembled a top cast but gave them relatively little to do, as if each actor was doing a guest appearance, but they do it well.  Both director and his middle-aged actors deserve credit for their courage.  <br />I'm probably a tough grader.  I like this film, though it could have been really nice.  After 3 DVD viewings, I'm warming up to it.  Others have discussed the stories in detail and the angst over the rating.  I will add my 2 cents to the dispute over the rating and discuss the DVD features, as well.<br />It is rated R for good, albeit unnecessary, reasons.  To me, the common usage of vulgar language and humor among the adult and child characters did not add anything or seem part of the story, and therefore seemed gratuitous.  At first, the nudity may seem just as gratuitous as the language.  But as one person below well noted, the naked body doubles on the movie set are not \\"naked\\" to each other.  That is, even though we see them simulating sex several times in the movie, it takes them until the end of the movie to get to the first romantic kiss (with their clothes on).  The nudity and sex had nothing to do with it.  They fell in love despite it all.  This may be a clever way to make a point but also may be lost on an adult audience too distracted to care.  If it's notnecessary to film a movie for an R rating, then why do it?  It's the story that matters.      <br />The DVD has 2 special features that are notable, the commentary track and the deleted scenes.  The commentary seems little more than wise cracks from Hugh Grant and Bill Nighy than anything else.  It's interesting that it includes commentary from 12-year-old Thomas Sangster (a cousin to Hugh Grant), who was too young to see the movie he was in.  The commentary recording session was the first time he'd seen it.  Still, it casts a little light on the production, how the film was made, and Curtis's fine sensitivity to aging lovers.  And, there is one deleted segment that Curtis should strive to restore, if he ever revisits his film.  This is a version of Sangster's run through an airport pursued by security police.  Sangster is a gymnastics prodigy.  This deleted version shows him demonstrating his athletic prowess, like Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as he flees the guards toward the young girl he loves.  Seeing him perform that scene and considering the craft he brought to his sensitive acting, one wonders that he would have been a superior choice over Jeremy Sumpter for Peter Pan in last year's film.  This scene is more exciting and fun than the one Curtis included in his movie.  When you see it, I think you'll understand what I mean.  Also, it nailed the notion for me that the film wanted to be as much satire as romance.     <br />In conclusion, I believe this film has a good heart, overall, for it only needed a gentler, smoother beat to live in my heart.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I didn't know about Black eyed peas until I saw the video where the guy is listening to it on his radio while he is driving the car into his work building lol.

I hope they keep making albums.
B000002ULO|4.0|Paul McCartney's fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr participated in this recording as did Steve Miller,who sang a duet with McCartney on USED TO BE BAD. If George Harrison,who was alive at the time of this recording,participated it could have been a Beatles album,if he and Ringo worked on all 14 tracks. Yoko Ono Lennon would not have let that be(be a Beatles album),though. She believes that without her late husband John,there is no Beatles. This album's recording first began in 1992,so the '92 recordings were probably OFF THE GROUND outtakes. Jeff Lynne,former frontman for the Electric Light Orchestra,produced or co-produced the album. Lynne produced music recorded by Harrison also(both were members of the all-star Traveling Wilburys). Hits include THE WORLD TONIGHT and YOUNG BOY,the latter being the opening theme for the Billy Crystal-Robin Williams movie &quot;Father's Day&quot;. Paul's son James Jr.(Paul's birth name was James Paul) gave moral support to his dad on the album. Junior was labeled a &quot;young turk&quot; in the liner notes on the album. One of Paul's best post-Beatles albums!

B00005JMEW|5.0|Could be read as a story of a mother eliminating all the bad stuff coming from the father [as dramatized by the killings of all the bad guys, and eventually the ultimate one, Bill, or Bill the father] and ending up in a &quot;happy&quot; fatherless mother-daughter dyad [though both trapped in their gaze at the TV, the virtual world; in the very last scene of Vol 2]. <br />Father is depicted as the seeds of all violence, and mother only as the victim-turned-killer-finally-mother. <br />However, needless to say, without the father, without the man, there could not be any conception, or children.<br />This glorification of women, to the extent of annihilating men, is a doomed &quot;solution&quot; to the perpetual men-women conflict [Kill men after getting his 'seeds', and women will be happy]. Even the child here is a daughter, not a boy. <br />A happy family, if we still believe in such a thing as a happy family, should be a dialectic and delicate balance between the maleness and femaleness of the couple; neither one should eliminate the other.<br />It is not that only women is the source of life, men is the necessary other. Simple Biology. Basic Evolutionary Psychology.<br />The wisdom does not lie in the old Chinese or Japanese stuff as depicted in the film, but in the heart of every man and woman. <br />Men and women still need each other. Killing Bill won't work.

In fact if you want to go further, in my opinion his vocal upstages Peter's in Harlequin - from the same disc (he could really hit those high notes).  As far as 'And Then There were Three' being a superior album...harumph!! not even in the same ballpark. (obvious not a real Genesis fan)

B00007AJGH|5.0|More than 15 years after its initial theatrical release, in this era when computer-generated animation and CG special FX are the mandatory norm, 1988's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT still stands firm as a groundbreaking, awe-inspiring, and wonderfully entertaining cinematic tour de force.  In technical terms, it is the first film to convincingly combine living actors and animated cartoon characters in the same frame and make it look convincing.  Thematically, it is a spoof of the noir films of the 1940s and 1950s, a slapstick comedy, and a satire of pre-civil-rights racial relations all rolled into one, sometimes referred to as the first genuine \\"cartoon noir.\\"<br />Based on the novel WHO CENSORED ROGER RABBIT? by Gary K. Wolf, the script by Jeffrey Price & Peter S. Seaman appropriately replaces Wolf's comic-book and newspaper-strip cartoons with more cinematic animated cartoon characters, but it retains the novel's satiric sociological subtext.  The film is set in an alternate-universe Hollywood of the 1940s where cartoon characters (colloquially referred to as \\"toons\\") live and breathe and interact with flesh-and-blood humans.  The toons are the social minority, and as with the minorities of the real-world U.S.A. during the early 20th century, they are given employment only as menial service workers or as entertainers, and for housing they are relegated to a Harlem-like ghetto (known in the film as Toontown).<br />The story itself follows hard-boiled gumshoe Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) as he tries to uncover evidence that will exonerate zany toon Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) of a murder rap.  Roger became the #1 suspect in the recent murder of Marvin Acme after it was discovered that the famous and wealthy gag-prop mogul had been rendezvousing secretly with Roger's sexy wife, Jessica Rabbit (voiced by an uncredited Kathleen Turner), and playing patty-cake with her.  Though Valiant once vowed never to work for a toon again after one murdered his brother, the cynical ol' sleuth turns out to be a bit sentimental and, feeling sorry for the funny bunny, takes Roger's case anyway.  But as the gushy gumshoe snoops for clues, he learns that there is more to Acme's murder than just a ploy to frame Roger; he uncovers a conspiracy that could lead to the demise of Toontown and its inhabitants!<br />Alternately hilarious and suspenseful, WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is replete with the kinds of throwaway gags, inside jokes, and one-liners that audiences would expect to see in an old-time cartoon short, while at the same time it unfolds into an intelligent who-done-it mystery worthy of Bogart's Sam Spade.  WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT represents the apex of 20th century filmmaking, but it is also wholesome family entertainment that offers something for kiddos and adults alike.  This one will still be enjoyed by audiences of all ages long after it becomes an icon in the history books.<br />As mentioned before, WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT offers the most convincing mix of live-action performers and hand-drawn animation ever put to celluloid.  While this is certainly due in part to the awesome skill and artistry with which the animators have inserted the cartoon characters, excellent performances from the \\"live\\" cast members--particularly Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd--also help to sell the illusion of realism.  Instead of cartoonishly overacting, overREacting, or pushing their performances too far over the top, the actors adopt a natural, matter-of-fact posture towards the cartoons, and this makes the audience believe that the human characters interact with animated critters on a daily basis.<br />The two-disc \\"Vista Series\\" DVD set from Disney Home Video is the definitive home-theater edition of the wonderful film.  Not only does it offer a pristine restored & remastered anamorphic widescreen transfer of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT (by the way, there's also a pan-and-scan version), there are tons of interesting and fun bonus features.  These includea really entertaining feature commentary with director Zemeckis, the screenwriters, and other crew members; a making-of featurette; three Roger Rabbit cartoon shorts that played in theaters before OTHER films (just like in the old days, folks); a deleted scene; and lots more!<br />The DVD collection of any serious film enthusiast will certainly contain a copy of this \\"cartoon noir\\" fantasy.  This is a must-own DVD of a must-own film!a really entertaining feature commentary with director Zemeckis, the screenwriters, and other crew members; a making-of featurette; three Roger Rabbit cartoon shorts that played in theaters before OTHER films (just like in the old days, folks); a deleted scene; and lots more!  <br />The DVD collection of any serious film enthusiast will certainly contain a copy of this \\"cartoon noir\\" fantasy.

B0001HAHXW|5.0|I'm a very accomplished blues/rock guitarist and I know the blues very well. Most of the songs on this album are songs which are usually not covered by other artists such as Last fair deal gone down or Hellhound on my Trail. I feel this is a terrific album and I think everyone should agree with me. However, there are some things about this album that I can understand why some people don't like it for instance its lack of creativity (every song is done almost exactly the way Johnson did them), Clapton's poor slide playing, and his piercing vocals on Hellhound on my trail. But besides all that, Clapton did a very good job and I feel this is going to make people realise that there was a man named Robert Johnson! (Note: I believe Robert Johnson was the starting of urban-style blues and probably the heir to rock itself)

0380789035|3.0|From the first chapter, the things that struck me most about &quot;American Gods&quot; was the similarity to Stephen King's writing style in some of his more mediocre horror books.<br />Like King, there are wonderful, creative ideas (old gods walking the Earth; new gods taking over for ideas like mass media and the Internet).<br />Like King, there are diverse characters with layers of issues (the main character, Shadow, develops a rather unique relationship with his dead wife, a plot perhaps more interesting than the earth-shaking main device).<br />Like King, there is a tendency toward adolescent melodrama (note especially how Shadow's wife dies).<br />Like many of King's novels, the ending fizzles.  Perhaps there was nowhere to go that would live up to the incredible ideas presented earlier in the book, or perhaps others were satisfied with the (thoroughly foreshadowed, yet still somewhat disappointing) &quot;twist&quot; at the end.<br />(**SPOILER**: I would have loved to see the effect upon the world when some of the modern gods bought the farm--does the loss of the god of strategic arms limitation pacts immediately dissolve such pacts and ensure a new arms race?  This would have given the events toward the end a more epic feel, though perhaps Gaiman wanted something closer in tone to the very last scene, which was somewhat reflective and more interesting than the entire second half of the book.)<br />The book did get me to do some research on mythology, though:  some of the &quot;name that god&quot; you will inevitably play while reading the book is very enjoyable, and the amount of research put into the characters is stunning.<br />Don't expect the great American novel:  expect an above-average action read.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Some may find the characters unlikeable.  However there are many enjoyable films which have unlikeable characters:  American Beauty for example. In fact, I wonder if Woody Allen has ever made a film whose main characters were likeable.  <br />This is an excellent movie for Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, Ewan McGregor, and Billy Crudup fans. All of whom must have appreciated the story.  <br />My husband and I were floored by this movie.  The emotional impact is indeed very strong and may be too much for young children.  Several times, I was in tears watching this movie. And, I have recommended it to many friends. <br />I truly believe that a movie of this caliber comes rarely in a lifetime.  <br />The story and quality of film making cannot be overstated.<br />There was no overkill with the fantasy or special effects elements.  Naturally, it is light fantasy.  If you feel uncomfortable with elements of fantasy you may be turned off by the movie.  <br />I was not shocked by any nudity.   <br />This is considerably more toned down, and the story has more depth than the other movies of Tim Burton.  Therefore, it is more accessible to those who are not fans of Tim Burton.  However, Tim Burton fans will still appreciate the film.

0802130208|5.0|Down deep in south Louisiana, is a small univesity employing a professor who is rumored to be Ignatius. Rumor has it he and Toole were roommates at LSU, and Toole consistently flustered/bemused by his roommate, immortalized him in the Confederacy of Dunces. Now, I've read the book, and I also took a class taught by said professor, who arrived to class via bicycle (think slow and lumbering) with dried shaving cream around his hairy ears, and mustard stains on his shirt. He frequently lost our 'blue book' exams, and then accused the class of not turning them in. The smell of the hallway containing his office can best be descibed as gamey. Class was dismissed early to go and catch stray dogs. How is he a teacher? He got himself appointed trustee of a multi-million dollar endowment to the University which dictates his professorship for life. He is so flawed and bumbling and completely clueless you really cannot but help like this man. He is utterly brilliant in literature, and always amusing. I don't think Toole created Ignatius so much as illustrated and portrayed a real person from his short life. I often think, as unfortunate as it is that his life was shortened, it was at least colorful.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I do not consider myself a movie watcher who needs action/adventures to be entertained.  In fact, I had high hopes for this film, but it was very disappointing.  The beginning is slow; the ending is meaningless, and, as for the rest, it was difficult to find a plot.  If we were suppose to understand the lonliness of the characters or the difficult times during marriages, I think that it could have been presented in a much more engaging way.<br />I think that most movies should be watched, just for the experience, but no one should buy this one.
0743454529|5.0|This book was so wondferful, though I am a sucker for stories that pull at the heartstrings. I read this book in two days while raising a toddler, getting little sleep, and writing a thesis. It was one of those books I will never forget.

All in all I believe for all of the children and families suffering with chronic illness we owe it to them to read this, plus you will love it.
B00005ATQH|5.0|\\"Lolita\\" is an ode to the sexually experimental sixties delivered by directorial baton master Stanley Kubrick.  While the film's listed screenwriter is Vladimir Nabokov, author of the novel being adapted to the screen, when his scenario was ultimately published it became obvious that Kubrick had placed his own stylish imprint on the script of the daring film.<br />The film begins in the manner of 1950 noir classic \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" in that we learn that one main character has been eliminated by another.  In the earlier film it was William Holden being shot by live in love Gloria Swanson, while in the 1963 Kubrick masterpiece an enraged and helpless James Mason makes good in his threat to kill Peter Sellers.  Before he is shot Sellers chides him, preferring to believe that his adversary will never follow through with his homicidal plan.<br />We then proceed to action four years earlier via flashback, when professor of literature Mason decides to spend a quiet summer in New Hampshire before starting a new job in the fall at an Ohio college.  He encounters love-starved widow Shelley Winters.  She hopes that his decision to rent a room in her home is occasioned by mutual attraction.  The motivator is instead an overpowering attraction toward her 14-year-old daughter, beautiful blonde Lolita played by screen newcomer Sue Lyon.<br />Tragedy occurs when Winters, reading Mason's private diary, learns that he thinks of her as a \\"love sick cow\\" and is passionately in love with Lyon.  She runs out into the street and is killed by an oncoming car.<br />Mason uses his strategic wits to become more than Lyon's stepfather, making good on his romantic designs.  Trouble soon looms, however, from an invading force.<br />The catalyst of danger is none other than Peter Sellers, who puts his virtuosity to work by masquerading as various characters such as a policeman and psychiatrist, tormenting Mason by convincing him that he knows what he is up to and that he might be perilously close to the jailhouse door.<br />Ultimately Lyon leaves a devastated Mason.  When he realizes that the zany but wily Sellers has let him court danger through sex with a minor while he plots to successfully take her away in a cleverly subtle ploy, Mason's desperation is pushed to full throttle.  The scenes between masterful tortured intellectual Mason and innovatively zany Sellers are some of the best in cinema annals, daring explorations of sexually driven psyches orchestrated by the imaginative Kubrick.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Dirk Voetberg (review dated April 25th), if you want people to read your review, at least put quite a bit of effort into making them factually correct. Joy Division &quot;inexplicably dismissed Ian Curtis from the band to create New Order.&quot; EH?!! Err, he killed himself, leaving them with no singer. Also Franz Ferdinand are a band, with four members, not one person, something that is hinted at by the fact that there are pictures of four seperate individuals in the booklet to the CD (which stands for Compact Disc, really!). And the Beatles only created 'some decent melodies'!? And we're expected not to skim your review.<br />Anyway, let's proceed.<br />This is a damn fine CD. One of the best debut albums of the last few years (along with submissions by the Libertines, Interpol and the Strokes). Sure it's hyped (especially in the UK), but some bands cut through that, making great music. Franz Ferdinand is one of those bands, in my opinion. The albums full of great tunes, with the standouts being 'Take Me Out', 'The Dark of the Matinee', 'Darts of Pleasure' and the soon-to-be classic 'Michael'. A great band, who alongside the aformentioned Libertines, Radiohead, Hope of the States and Muse (Absolution was the album of 2003 by a long way) are at the forefront of a great British music scene. Oh, and will people please stop buying the Darkness' album, you'll only encourage them to make more.<br />P.S. I'm quite aware of the fact that Dirk's review may be tongue-in-cheek, I mean he gave JLo's newest album 5 stars, and what's funnier than that.
B00005JN02|4.0|Another good film from Germany (and from the producer of \\"Run Lola Run\\") \\"Good Bye Lenin!\\" is best enjoyed when you see it not as a comedy ... actually, it is a comedy, but its tone is more subdued than films like \\"Life Is Beautiful,\\" and the best part of the film is in fact its dramatic part about the son and the mother.<br />It's 1989, the year which was to witness the end of the notorious walls in Berlin.  Now, Alex is an ordinary boy living in East Germany with his sister and mother.  Just before the big social changes happen, however, Alex's mother collapses because of heart attack and is hospitalized in coma.<br />Luckily, she wakes up again after eight months, but the dcotor warns that any shock could be fatal to her condition.  The problem is, she was a devoted member of the former regime (which is rapidly going) and the products from the West are rushing into the place where Alex and his mom are living.  In short, a red Coca Cola logo could kill her instantly.<br />So Alex starts to lie before his mother, pretending that the former commune is still healthily going on, even faking up the news reports on TV (with a help from his friend who wants to be a film director).  But can Alex keep on this pace forever before the huge social changes that would sweep up the whole nation?<br />The premises are slightly contrived, I admit, but the film works well because of the credible portraits of the mother and the son.  The actors are doing exceptional jobs, especially Daniel Bruhl playing Alex, whose ideas of \\"for the sake of mother\\" goes beyond the normal territory, but who remains still a likable and charming fellow all through the film.  Katrin Sass who plays his mother is also great, whose fragile portraits of the mother easily convince us of the reason her son should care for her so much.<br />Another strength is the charming music by acclaimed musician Yann Tiersen, whose name might be remembered as the one behind the lovely score of lovely French film called \\"Amelie.\\"<br />There are lots of funny scenes in the film, but the sad tone is always felt behind the hilarious moments.  And that is right when we come to realize that after all this is a story about a mother and her son, and the understanding between them, as the surprising ending suggests to us.  How much do we know about our parents, or children?  The film's messsage under the comic gesture is as heavy as that question.
0671004107|5.0|Let me start with a few key points about the book, the movie, and the original screen treatment which precedes both.<br />&quot;Contact&quot; (the film) is NOT an adaptation.  Carl Sagan died in the midst of production, but up until that point, he was on the set working with actors, directors, and prior to that with writer James V. Hart every single day.  Sagan and Druyan initially planned Contact as a film, but the idea was EXPANDED in the book.  The book spans many, many years and has multiple perspectives.  Although it would be possible to do the same with the medium of film (and in a select few instances, Zemeckis chooses this approach), it's a much riskier approach and, if you know your Contact history, not what Sagan and Druyan originally intended.<br />The main theme (as evidenced by its placement in the book's resolution) in the book is Ellie's isolation.  As for science and religion, it's less about conflict and more about faith: Sagan notes (as others have, though less eloquently) that faith is no less necessary for science than for religion.<br />As for Ellie...brilliant!  What's unique about Sagan's characterization of a woman in science is the exploration of her faults: her stubbornness, her self-absorption, her inability to truly connect, her own xenophobia...the list goes on.  So few authors can present a character in a balanced manner without suggesting that she will somehow be punished for her humanity.  In the end, the only judgment that comes to Ellie is her own--despite her self-absorption, Ellie has little sense of her SELF.  All her confidence--all her strength--has roots that Ellie herself has been unwilling to recognize.  The film does not, in my estimation, present Ellie as a &quot;sanctimonious whiner,&quot; but there are certain limitations of the medium, especially considering that the book is written with Ellie's THOUGHTS in mind while maintaining the distance of a 3rd person narrative.  How do you bring what is on the inside out?<br />To the reader who said he or she &quot;bought the book the next day and will never bother with another film adaptation of Sagan ever again (and will be hard pressed to justify seeing anything made by those who defiled Sagan in this movie),&quot; I remind you that Sagan was among those filmmakers.

B00005JKBC|4.0|Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) is finally ready to retire.  He has spent his life working for the CIA as a top-secret spy and has trained many of the young spies currently working for the CIA.  He has never let any of them get to him - until Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt).  Nathan and Tom parted on less than amicable terms, but when Nathan hears that Tom has been captured in China and is scheduled to be executed the next day for espionage, he knows he has to do something.  Nathan manages to maneuver himself into the group investigating Tom's capture and Nathan discovers that Tom was not on a CIA mission when he was captured - he went rogue.  While the committee pumps Nathan for information regarding Tom and their relationship, Nathan realizes that the CIA has no intention of claiming Tom and are planning on sacrificing him for a better relationship with China.  Nathan strings the committee on as long as he can to try and decide what he can do to help Tom because he knows exactly why Tom was in China - and Nathan is the one who gave her to them...<br />Spy Game was a very suspenseful film that caught my attention from the first moment and didn't let go.  I thought that Robert Redford's portrayal of Nathan Muir was riveting and quite interesting in terms of his CIA involvement.  Brad Pitt was also very able in his role as Tom Bishop, a young spy struggling to maintain his distance from those people that he was spying on.  The supporting cast was also very good and they really fit into the parts well.  Director Tony Scott did a wonderful job in using flashbacks to show Nathan and Tom's relationship all the way from their beginnings in Vietnam to their falling out in the Near East.  Many directors who use flashbacks just end up disrupting the film and you feel like they don't really fit, but every flashback was used to illustrate a character trait in both Nathan and Tom so that, by the end, you knew exactly what motivated both characters and why they were doing what they did.  I also really liked the short time frame that the movie dealt with - one day!  I was really on pins and needles by the end to see what, if anything, was going to happen.  If you are looking for a good spy film, or just like Robert Redford or Brad Pitt, this is well worth your time to check out!also really liked the short time frame that the movie dealt with - one day!

6304071906|2.0|Good News: Don't get me wrong I thought the other actors were good but it just seems that Walken (no matter what he is doing or saying) is a natural standout. He seems to illicit an overwhelming presence in this movie. In my opinion, he should have had a bigger part. Now the scenery juxtoposed with the set design is beautiful and awe-inspiring. Still not understanding what exactly is so devastating about this movie in conjunction with giving the western a bad name (if you ask me, some of those western are worse then this one). <BR>Now the Bad News: I gave this movie two stars because of it's implausible plot (how Kris's character got to harvard and then to the west is beyond me), sound effects (compeletely atrocious), music (trite at best), and long, drawn out scenes (including the totally editable first scene). I still want at least and hour and 30 minutes of my life back from the 3 hours and 40 minutes it stole. Michael Cimino sure did a number on my senses. If you are still curious about this movie make sure you don't drink to much water.

I hope this helped.Linkin Park rocks!
B0000BWTK3|5.0|Andsnes is such a pianist who can make a very striking point in his performances without ever doing `too much', a most welcome ability, particularly in pieces that sometimes fall prey to unnecessarily sluggish Romantic interpretations. The Grieg concerto can, in the wrong hands, sound like a shorter version of the saccharine Tchaikovsky B flat minor. No such things in Andsnes' performance, however. He has an impressive and authoritative command of the music and never lacks in lyricism, strength or virtuosity, yet there's nothing at all in his playing that sounds forced, exaggerated or overly aggressive. His wonderful build-up of the climax in the first movement cadenza is simply priceless. And listen to the enthusiasm with which he jumps into the third movement's main theme (also in the recap). It sounds so simple, yet the effect is marvellous. But Andsnes can also play in perfect sympathy with a conductor, as it shows here. This time, I thought the standard picture inside the booklet of pianist-and-conductor-staring-at-score was genuine. Andsnes and Jansons (who conducts the Berliner Philharmoniker) simply collaborate together perfectly. In the final for example, it seems as if both are constantly driving each other further. Jansons' BPhO also has a wonderfully rich and beautiful sound. The flutes and strings in the typically Norse theme that appears after 2'40 in the final, for instance, are marvellous.  <br />The other concerto here is the Schumann, a piece that can be treated as merely chamber music (as in the classic Richter recording). But Andsnes and Jansons choose for a more large-scale approach that fits the piece equally well, I think. In fact, it is played so well that you hardly need other performances than this. There's a great feeling for the structure: every phrase in the concerto seems to follow completely logically after the previous one. Even more importantly, the pianist and the orchestra again play as though they're speaking through one mouth. This may be even more important than in the Grieg, because I think it's mainly the *combination* of piano and orchestral sound that can make the Schumann concerto sound so special. One of my favourite moments occurs after 3'30 in the first movement, where the piano starts a rousing melody that ends in an orchestral tutti after 4'00. As played here, it is exactly the way I think it should sound, with all its amazing subtleties and poetry. This is essentially what makes the whole concerto so good: listen closely and you'll hear how precisely Andsnes and Jansons respond to each other. But in the `solo' moments they are equally impressive: listen to Andsnes' thrilling first movement cadenza or the little orchestral fugue three minutes into the final, or the wonderful tutti after 4'30, with great timpani support as well. This all makes a pretty impressive recording and a very strong coupling of the Grieg and Schumann concertos altogether. The sound is very good too, although there's some hiss in the background (may be caused by the fact that it's recorded live). Overall a simply essential disc for those who like piano concertos in general.
B00018D44U|3.0|I loved Norah's first album.  Her take on more traditional standards was refreshing.  The jazzy, bluesy, even country (not a big country fan) feel of her album was also something that I liked. I was really anticipating the new album and rushed out to buy it when it was released only to listen and keep hoping that something would blast through the speakers and pull me into the web of her music like the first album did but unfortunately that did not happen.  Although, there are a couple of songs that stand out, it is a cd that is pleasnat to listen to.  Not much more but certainly not anything less.

I find there is only one song to avoid &quot;Six shooter&quot;, they were uninspired to the point to scream bad stuff, so uninspired that it last 1:19 minutes.

074325144X|5.0|I am the suspicious writer, yes, a long time friend of Katherine Bergin, now Dreyer, but I've never met Danny.  I stayed at their home in California while on a trip from where I live in Stamford, Connecticut, while they traveled.   I am a long time runner and I still say I've never read a better book about running, but now it's the third review I've written and that too probably won't look good.  However I feel obligated to straighten out the mess I created.   I wrote the review from Katherine's computer...so it's showing up as her...a terrible mistake on my part. I've never done this before.   I tried to cancel it, thought I had and wrote my second review minutes later from my own email thinking the first one was deleted.  <br />I mostly apologize to Katherine and Danny but also to everyone who thinks they've done something underhanded.  I wrote because I think people should know about this book and this technique.  Lousy with computers, I am an OK athlete and I was able to quickly pick up on Danny's suggestion and now I have less pain.  Again, my apologies for making a mess of this.<br />Seems I've created a problem that was not my intention.
B0000027G6|5.0|First, be aware the SACD CD's may not play in older CD players, unless they are specifically labeled that they will play SACD media. (Has nothing to do with this review, but many are confused on this point.)<br />Very succinct review:<BR>Each main character (including the calvary) in the movie has his own theme music. As the character's development on film continues, so does the embellishment in the score.<br />The masterful touch is the blending of each themes as the film characters compliment or conflict with the other. As you listen to the music over and over, these subtleties come across. The cd can be played many times over, each time one discovers nuances not discovered before. It's as though Mr. Barry has discovered new shades of color never seen before. These are insinuated in the orchestration of the score.<br />I also love the &quot;Great American West&quot; feel of the music, similar to Copeland and evocative of a Charles Russell painting.<br />It is a symphonic dream,  and one of the relatively few pieces of music that justifies the cost of a good stereo system.
B0000700KL|5.0|A few years ago I was switching TV channels at about 12 a.m. when I came across this film playing on Bravo. I was stunned and watched mesmerized by the power of the images I was witnessing. At the end I cried because the world seemed much more clear to me than before. <br />I eventually hunted down a copy on VHS only to be gravely disappointed. Then I found the DVD version, disappointed again at it's quality. But now with this digitally transfered widescreen edition out, it was worth the wait. And for those with 5.1 surround, be prepared, the sound detail is clear as a bell - beautiful!
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) is a prison psychiatrist trying to make sense of her patients' apparent delusions. Driving home from work one night in the pouring rain, she veers to avoid a pedestrian who is standing the middle of the road. Miranda wakes up three days later to find herself confined to the same psychiatric ward where she used to work. Accused of murdering her husband and terrorized by violent hallucinations, she remembers nothing since her encounter with the pedestrian in the road.<br /><br />I have to give &#34;Gothika&#34; some credit. This supernatural thriller understands that isolation is the key to horror. Miranda Grey suffers the worst form of emotional isolation because she is considered insane. Her behavior is understood to be irrational and dangerous, ipso facto,  because she's crazy. -As opposed to her being considered crazy because of her behavior. Halle Berry is pretty convincing. Robert Downey, Jr. is underused as a fellow psychiatrist at the prison. Penelope Cruz is fine as a troubled inmate. But &#34;Gothika&#34; suffers from the most common horror film flaw: People do not behave as people actually would. The psychiatrists are utterly goofy. The plot is full of holes and implausible coincidences. But, director Mathieu Kassovitz has managed has created some real -if spotty- suspense nevertheless. &#34;Gothika&#34; isn't without entertainment value. It's a worthwhile rental if you're looking for something spooky and mindless.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a music video for &#34;Behind Blue Eyes&#34; by Limp Bizkit and a solid audio commentary by director Mathieu Kassovitz and cinematographer Matthew Libatique. I was pleased to find commentary by the cinematographer, as I've wished for it on so many movies. The result is a lot of discussion of lighting, set design, and filming.
0679736646|5.0|In Ubik, first published in 1969, we find the first distinct appearance of the transcendental element in Dick's work.  In his earlier novels, he had been content to demonstrate that there is no \\"objective\\" reality irrespective of consciousness: the mind essentially constructs its own world. In Ubik, the protagonist Joe Chip, condemned to a perpetual \\"half-life\\" of suspended animation after a fatal accident,  finds his world inexorably deteriorating around him. The only thing standing between Joe and complete extinction is a product called Ubik, which comes in spray cans, and, when sprayed on, instantly counteracts the forces of destruction. Among other things, Ubik appears as a razor blade, a deodorant, a bra, a breakfast cereal, a pill for stomach relief, plastic wrap, a salad dressing, a used car, and a savings and loan. As its name implies, it is ubiquitous. Though a symbol of the divine, it is not a mere magical aid but a gift that can only be summoned by the person who needs it through an exercise of will and intelligence. The ending of Ubik has a twist that calls into question the substantiality of the \\"real world.\\" This is my favorite PKD novel, the one that combines the most dazzling metaphysics with the most involving story and characters. After reading it, one can only start scanning one's own environment for hopeful signs of the redeeming Ubik!

B00003CWPL|4.0|This is David Lynch's film school final project, and is legendary for its humor, bleakness and impressive special effects for The Baby.  Stop looking here if you want to buy it & go to Lynch's website - that's the only place where it's available, and it's not Amazon cheap, either.  It takes a very special type of personality to enjoy this movie - if you didn't like Blue Velvet for its weirdness, stay FAR away from this one!

This cd is absoutely wonderful and showcases what she does best..mellow music. &quot;All About Our Love&quot; is hands down the best song on the cd, but is is too short and leaves the listener longing for more. However, every song on this cd satisfies in a simplistic and classy manner.

B00005JMEW|5.0|The Bride (Uma Thurman) awakes after 4 years in a coma to the realization that her entire wedding party was massacred and her unborn child lost, when she chose marriage over her  career as a professional assassin.

Fox), and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), who were responsible for the bloodbath that put her in a coma.<br /><br />&#34;Kill Bill&#34; is ceremoniously billed as &#34;The Fourth Film by Quentin Tarantino&#34;, and this time the irrepressible director has set out to prove his talent by directing an action movie, which he considers to be the toughest genre. If it weren't tough enough, Tarantino has drawn on just about every action genre that ever existed to create this high energy protracted battle of a film: Hong Kong martial arts film, 1970s grindhouse cinema, spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation, gangster movies, japanimation, and film noir. And I'm thoroughly impressed. &#34;Kill Bill&#34; is possibly more an exercise in style than any film I've seen. What's more, the genres that it emulates tend toward the absurd. &#34;Kill Bill&#34; is self-consciously stylish and preposterous. Yet it is entirely captivating and exciting. It's gory. It's funny. It's in black-and-white, split screen, animated, color...No style is spared, and yet none is out of place.<br /><br />There's hardly a plot, but &#34;Kill Bill&#34; keeps the audience interested in the story -mostly by telling it out of sequence. I'm a huge fan of film noir. Quentin Tarantino's fantastically creative facility with neo-noir has endeared him to me in the past. &#34;Kill Bill&#34; is noir, among many other things. And if Tarantino can make this completely preposterous film work, I have to concede that he's a genius. He has even succeeded in convincing a large American audience to watch a movie that has subtitles. &#34;Kill Bill, Volume 1&#34; is thoroughly enjoyable, action-packed, and not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary and 2 performances by the Japanese musical group &#34;5, 6, 7, 8's&#34;. &#34;The Making of Kill Bill&#34; is a 20 minute documentary that features interviews with writer/director Quentin Tarantino, Uma Thurman, producer Lawrence Bender, Lucy Liu, and Viveca A.

B00014K5TQ|4.0|Seth Green is perhaps the finest comedic actor working. He carried this movie. Macauly Caulkin tries way too hard to mimic Michael Alig's physical and vocal mannerisms, but doesn't quite pull it off. It is just that - plain mimicry.  I have seen the original &quot;Shockumentary&quot; and I have to say Seth Green's take on James St. James is nothing short of incredible. The odd cadence in his speech, and that weird nasally way he speaks. It's just amazing how Green literally becomes St. James.  This film was largely ignored by the public, and critics didn't take much of a shine to it either. The subject matter either too bizarre, or maybe just not bizarre enough...who knows. I go back and forth when trying to decide which I like best, the original documentary ( which is great ) or the film. There are actual  Laugh Out Loud comedic moments in the film, even though most of the humour is a little on the dark side. But there is something about the documentary that brings me back to it again and again. I just can't stop watching it. The Shockumentary, by the same duo that made The Eyes of Tammy Faye, I would give a 5 star rating. The film, I give 4 stars.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|I missed this movie at the theater and have been waiting for its dvd release with considerable anticipation.  I'm happy to say that the wait was worth it.  This film has a great cast of actors including Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Lian Neeson, Laura Linney and Hugh Grant---whose characters are all dealing with different levels of love and relationships.  There is Emma's character dealing with her husband being unfaitful;  Liam's character dealing with the death of his wife and his endearing relationship with his stepson; Hugh Grant's priminister falling for a young lady from the wrong side of the tracks; and Colin Firth's character dealing with love and the barrier of two languages.  The director seams the stories together nicely and leaves the audience with a renewed faith in love and a realization that love comes in many forms---love for a sibling, love for a stepchild and, of course, romantic love.  Not every story in this film has a perfect ending but the overall effect is that love is all around us.  In a time when we seem to focus on the hatred and wars of the world, this little film gives a small sample of what we all need--love!
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina does have a great voice, but sometimes it seems as though she oversings and it makes her music a bit unbearable...but that's just my opinion. However, this is a very solid cd, &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Cruz&quot; are wonderful and so is &quot;Infatuation&quot;. Despite the criticism, Christina has proven that she has staying power and talent to back it up. Good for her!
B0000028VT|3.0|I wont say that this is one of the greats of all time for music, or anything like that.<br />The lyrics are mediocre and there is a lot of similar music.<br />However it is pleasant music to relax to, or put on at a party. Mariah has a strong, attractive voice, and songs like `Dream Lover', `Hero' and `Just to hold you Once Again' are good melodies. She does a great rendition of the all-time classic `Without You'. The album has a good Motown feel. If you like that sort of music, it is definitely worth getting a copy.<br />Mariah is best in concert as a live performer. She is an attractive, talented girl, and hopefully will carry on performing for many years to come.

Speaking of that.....<br />While it serves as the soundtrack of one of the WORST movies of all time, it's influence on modern popular music cannot be denied. This album has been influenced people like The Neptunes(and their side project N.E.R.D), D'Angelo, Musiq, Bilal, Beyonce, Pink and TLC just to name a few. The music is so inventive, yet would not sound as good without his long time backing band, comprised of Wendy and Lisa, Dez, Fink and Bobby Z. This album rocks, and I don't mean it in the metaphorical sense; this album truly ROCKS! With its Hendrix-like guitar solos is &quot;Let's Go Crazy',  and &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; (which is played without a bassline; UNSPEAKABLE for a black artist!) will apease any rock fan. This album is also revolutionary in another way; &quot;Darling Nikki&quot;(which the Foo Fighters did a wonderful cover of recently), got Tipper Gore in a tizzy, which would eventually lead to all record companies requiring warning labels for explicit content. The title track ballad is one of the best title tracks in music history; it's closes the album in resounding fashion. This album would make His Royal Badness into a mega-star, rivaling only Michael Jackson and Madonna is popularity. While he would hit his true accomplishment with &quot;Sign O' The Times&quot;, this worthy of anybody's music collection.
B00014NE62|5.0|Some of the best films by the creative team of Merchant/Ivory were adapted from works of E. M. Foster.  This beautifully filmed movie is a story about a young man who struggles with his sexual orientation and his status in society.  James Wilby plays the title character honestly and with dignity as he searches for love, falling for a good friend ,Clive, (played by a young Hugh Grant) and eventually following his heart and falling for a young man of a lower class.  \\"Maurice\\" and \\"A Room With a View\\" are great companion films and well worth an addition to your personal library.  As a bonus, this new version of the film offers a second disc with extra features, but the real gift is that this film has finally been released on dvd.  A classic film with a classic theme---the search for love and acceptance.  I highly recommend this movie!!!!

The lyrics are so pedestrian, would you even guess that &quot;This Ain't No Picnic&quot; deals with racism?<br />Meat Puppets II, Murmur, and Zen Arcade all blow this one away.

Look out for performances from Jim Carrey, Nicholas Cage, Hellen Hunt, and a young Sofia Copola (director of Lost in Translation, Virgin Suicides) as Peggy's bratty kid sister (is there another kind?) Great musical score.  And this is the one flick guranteed to make me tear up everytime.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|OMG!  this is an amazing movie.  the story is captivating, characters and plot are fun,...  i saw it in the theaters 2x!  great father's day gift!!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|This is a supercool soundtrack. Quinton Tarantino is so good at choosing the right music to enhance his films. One of his best so far. It almost tops Pulp Fiction.  I wonder if Kill Bill II can live up to this one?
B000059T1G|4.0|This album contains two classic Traffic tunes in &quot;Shanghai Noodle Factory&quot; and &quot;Medicated Goo&quot;, plus the haunting ballad &quot;Withering Tree&quot;.  Not enough live music is available from this band, so the two songs recorded at the Fillmore are also a good reason to buy this CD.  However, if this is your first purchase of live Traffic, try instead &quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot; as somewhat representative of the early group, or &quot;On the Road&quot;, which has better recording quality and presents the revamped group toward the end.<br />Canteen includes two Mason solo pieces and quite a nice extended version of Gimme Some Lovin, the hit from Winwood's SDG days.  The other three tunes are Traffic originals, which cannot be said for the live material on Last Exit.  One of the live originals is &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot;, which was also the title tune from the group's first studio album, released in the UK in December 1967.  A fantastic blues-rock number, and if what one reviewer said were true, Mr. Fantasy certainly was a stroke of genius by the band, in that it copied chords later found in Hey Jude (recorded July 1968 and released in August that year).  Another possibly even better live version of this classic song was recently added to Winwood's latest solo CD titled About Time.
1568497369|5.0|This book is brilliant. I would have never guessed that ending. It was the best murder mystery I've ever read, and it was just for my pre-ap English class. It never gets boring. I would reccomend this book to anybody. Trust me, once you start reading, you can't stop.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|My ex-girlfriend should watch this flick and figure out just what the hell her problem is.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is about a girl( Uma Thurman) who was beat up and put in a comma for four years named Bill. Now that she knows her unborn baby has died because of this, sh want's to kill Bill. This was a cool movie if your older than 17( It's very violent). Pulp Fiction is a little better, but who cares! This is Uma Thurman's best film so far. Go see it if you want.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Everyone is giving this movie a bad rating? Why? I loved this movie! I thought it was almost as good as the matrix... the storyline rocks and the special effects are amazing!!<br />But then, I'm also a big fan of the matrix series (except reloaded).  Matrix Revolutions (i thought) was going to be dumb, boring, and stupid because of what Reloaded was.  But I found it to be thrilling, and amazing!  The plot was actually going somewhere, Neo had to rescue the people from the machines... so if people say there wasn't a plot, they're wrong and deceitful. :)<br />But anyway, the movie starts out intriguing, and I guess I'll just stop here, and let you watch the movie for yourself (if you haven't).  Yes, it is worth buying!!  I will probably buy it (and the soundtrack)!<br />anyway, don't give up on this movie! :-D
B0001AP12G|4.0|The casual mainstream audience doesn't know what to do with this, because it's such a different sound for them. For the most part, they like it, even though they don't quite understand what it is or why they like it. It's hip-hop, and I'm not sure that it has manifested itself into a graspable concept for the Lil' Flip and Chingy crowd.<br />Personally, I bump groups like Gang Starr, De La Soul, Black Star, and emcees like MF Doom and Jeru the Damaja, so if a person with my preferences and tastes approves of Kanye West, you know you've got a pretty good artist on your hands. And I wouldn't even consider myself a huge Kanye fan, I mean I like the guy, it's just that he's such a refreshing presence in the hip-hop mainstream. I didn't know how many more re-incarnations of Nelly I could take.<br />Thumbs up to Kanye West.
B000148KK2|2.0|Sorry to say it, since I'm a big DK fan, but the crowd has it right on this one. A disappointing fare, to be sure, with the singular exception of Narrow Daylight. That tune speaks volumes. And being one of the &quot;departure&quot; songs in this collection, it proves that Diana is capable of extending her reach without losing her style. Diana, if you're reading this, keep the faith!
B0001611DI|3.0|I thought this was going to be a good movie, i was wrong. It had bad actors and cheesy affects and it was the most boring zombie movie ive ever seen next to Lucio Fulci's Zombie.  Zombie didnt have cheesy affects and bad acting but it was boring. This version is gay the directors cut is probably better, i dont know usually the directors cut has better affects and stuff. The blood in this movie looks like melted crayons. I waised $20.00 on this dvd where i live and it was the worst thing i ever bought!!!
B00005JMUA|1.0|I liked the first Kill Bill, but this one went nowere and was so stuip. Infact I was laughing the intire time. The worst part is were Uma Thurman is tied up and buried 5 miles under ground. So how she is able to get her feet untided, get a knife, untie her arms, punch her way out of the cofin she was in, and just climb up the 5 miles of dirt. This was the first summer film I have seen and it was bad. I hope Van Helsing, Alien vs. Predator, and Resident Evil 2 are better.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM! I was very skeptical at first (even with Madonna guest appearing )because I ABSOLUTELY HATED! her previous releases. So I did not exactly rush out to buy this CD. Now, I can't stop listening to it!\\"Zone\\" has that mature feel (both musically and lyrically) to it that I can relate to (I'm 33 yrs. old) More importantly, for me, there is this whole range of different sounds encorporating RnB,dancehall/reggae(I LOVE The Hook Up), electronica, Indian/bangra beats and rhythms, even a touch of the mid-east and orient (Touch of My Hand...my ABSOLUTE FAV!). Too many artistes today find a  formula and that's all you hear throughout the entire album with very little variation in between songs. BO-RIINNNNG! I like an album that's ecclectic in sound, mood, feel. An album that sings to me on many different levels: soft and romantic, high dance-octane, sensual/sexy. \\"Zone\\" is all these things and then some. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves to get KRONKIN' on a dancefloor even if it's in the middle of your own living room.
0385720920|1.0|I was a huge fan of Chuck after reading Fight Club, Invisible Monster, and Survivor.  After trying to read Choke, I dropped Chuck.  There was a flare to his writing with the subtle gross out factor and extreme story lines, but Choke was just stupid.  I couldn't even finish reading the book (I have read the previous three mentioned numerous times).  There is only so much I can stand of reading about snot.  I haven't read any of his other books since Choke because I was so disappointed.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE FIRST THREE THOUGH.
B00005RYLE|5.0|I love this movie favorite zombie movie next to night of the living dead. First i rented it and i thougt it was going to be stupid after watching it i loved it that night i watched it two more times. After awhile i went out to hang out with friends and i saw the Evil Dead Book of the Dead edition, i bought it and loved it. The movie is good for its time and good affects until the end when the zombies start melting that was the only thing i hated about it!!! But i still think Evil Dead 2 was better.
B00012QM9K|5.0|This posting is in direct response to the post placed by: &lt; M R Hocker from London United Kingdom &gt;<br />First off &quot;pal&quot;, pardon the pun, but you are a complete buffoon!  DVDs in the UK, yes that includes england, are all region (2) encoded.  Well guess what Einstein, in the U.S., all DVD Players are programmed to play DVDs encoded as region (1).  So, your bloody little UK edition of `Schindler's List' would not play on the DVD Players here.<br />Secondly, with the exception of computers but not as a primary, there are NO primary applications of the PAL Formatting currently in use here in the United States.  Many DVD Players here that are little more than a year old or older &amp; even some new ones will not properly recognize the PAL Format (the European Format) because all commercially/mass produced movie-DVDs in the United States &amp; Canada are created in the NTSC Format.  Just as most all of our related A/V equipment that it would be played on, is programmed to run the NTSC mediums as well.  Further, let us not forget that a 3rd type of Format called SECAM is also used in Europe (France).  Besides, which type of PAL Formatting are you using??  Throughout Europe there are many different *types* of PAL Formats currently in use...*A, B, I, H, G*, so-on &amp; so-on...<br />Thirdly, there is no definitive proof, in the old debate, that either the PAL (at 25 fps - frames per second) or NTSC (at 30 fps) Format is any better than the other.  The sole reason we have ALL these various Formats everywhere is quite simple, marketing strategy.  This is the case basically because unique marketing styles were developed &amp; are in use in different parts of the World.  It's actually really quite simple indeed; get off of your british bum &amp; swap-out, instead of flip-flop, your two sad little region (2) discs.  And if you require anymore cheeses to go with that whine of yours, I suggest that you \\"secam\\" in France \\"pal\\"!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie delivered much more than I expected.  Excellent intertwining stories, casting, writing, acting, and music gave me everything I wanted in a movie and more.  The storyline dealing with the unfaithful husband, however, did not resolve itself as suggested by Livetoact1404.  At the very end when the wife picks her husband up from the airport after his business trip it is clear she doesn't trust him and says she's &quot;fine&quot; in the same &quot;put a good face forward&quot; manner she used Christmas Eve, and when she says let's go home, the sarcasm in her voice at the use of the word &quot;home&quot; is pointed.  In any event, while not all storylines end like a fairytale they really shouldn't have, and the movie, overall, is still wonderfully uplifting.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie is truely one of the best ones I have ever seen!  Edward Bloom's adventures are absolutely fantastic, and the characters and scenery are extremely memorable.  I have owned this dvd for 2 days, and have already watched it twice!  My favorite parts were the town of specter, where nobody wears shoes, and the circus part, with Danny Devito.  The town of specter was wonderful.  It is the kind of place I would love to live, if such a place existed.  I found the townspeoples' friendliness to be wonderfully refreshing in a world where hostility is ever increasing.  I even got emotionally choked up several times while watching this amazing film.  Make sure you have a box of tissues handy, as you will need them.  For a breath of fresh air, and a break from the stress of everyday life, I heartily recommend this movie!
0618526412|5.0|Beautiful story, very fast and emotional. I feel it will stay with me forever. Makes me happy just to have read it.
B000002L9O|4.0|at first listen i did not enjoy this album at all,but after getting into it for awhile,i think it's a gem. It might not be as good as Too Tough to Die but its way better than Halfway To Sanity(worst Ramones album IMO).None of the tracks here suck probably the intro of Apeman Hop is the only thing that might make u think twice
B0000DD7LB|5.0|'In The Zone' is quite different from Britneys three previous CD's.  I have been a big fan of the earlier music so its taken a while for 'In The Zone' to grow on me.  Now Im really loving it.  My personal faves are 'Me Againsed The Music', 'Boom, Boom, Boom' (yes okay its a basic, repetative song with somewhat cheesy lyrics but its fun, I like it), 'Breathe On Me', 'Toxic', 'Shadow', 'Brave New Girl' - that ones got a dance vibe to it and the beautiful ballad 'Everytime'.  'Outrageous' is probably the only song that I dont really like on the whole CD, besides that its great and definately recomended.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I bought this movie at the recommendation of a friend, and was extremely regretful of doing so.  This movie, in my opinion, was dreary, depressing, creepy, and downright lousy.  I don't know how anyone, unless they are on drugs, could enjoy this film.  This film puts nothing on your mind except depression and death.  I personally prefer movies that show the true beauty of life, such as the recently released Big Fish.  Finally, if you are not depressed, Donnie Darko will still surely cast a shadow of darkness and depression over your day.
079284131X|3.0|This is the second worst horror series ever made.  The first one is good but  after that they get stupid.. I thought the part at the end of Bribe of Chucky when  his girl friends gives birth to a baby was stupid. <br />Basically move is about Charles ray  a wanted murder.  At the beginign ray runs from a police cop into a toy store.  Where he is shoot as his body is dying.  Ray not wanting to rest until the cop and his double cross  partner Eddy Copbal is dead.  Peforms a vodo ritual which trasnfer his soul into a good guy doll named chucky.<br />He is sold to a little boy name andy.  He goes on a kill spring.  No body  believes the truth that Chucky is reponsible for the killings.  Final the  mon and the cop<br />Chucky than  sets of  to transfer his soul into Andy body before he becomes human and becomes stuck in the doll for ever.<br />In the end after chuck is bably  burned and his head arms and feet are blasted of  his body.  By then his body is almost human.  The cop agains his gun and shoot Chuckey in the heart killing him instantly.<br />Rays soul descend into hell where it remains untils the doll is  remade in the squel.  If you like this movie I recommend Child Plays 2, 3 and the Bride of Chuckey also.  Andy is in every movie in the Child's Play series except bride of Chucky the worst of the four by my opion.
B00005JGAF|5.0|from start to finish..this album is truly the best
055321277X|3.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  was not at all long as I had thougt it would have been.  Although it did give a sort of linguring essence.  To me it wrapped me into the story by telling of glimpses of Mr. Hyde.  How he trampled the girl and killed Sir Danvers Carew.  It had me intwined with the profound doctor by day and the evil, luciritive monster by night.  Just knowing in the beginning that there was something out there that was cruel enough to kill a poor girl and have no actions toward it but to &quot;pay&quot; the family for what it had done is cazy.  And the middle  of the story brings you further into it because you don't know what is going on with Dr. Henry Jekyll.  All you know is that there is something seriously wrong with him.  And the end, well it wasn't the best.  It just gave the answer to the &quot;problem&quot; of Jekyll and Hyde by mere  letter.  I mean it could have been something more.  <BR>     Although I am pretty sure everyone has heard of the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, how it was the potion that transformed Jekyll into Hyde.  I mean who doesn't know the story?  But as Stevenson wrote &quot;evil consists not in action but in character&quot; and to me that quote symbolizes the theme of the book.  It wasn't entirely Jekylls faught (him making the potion was) but it was his &quot;split personality&quot; Hyde.<BR>                       Robert Louise Stevenson captured the views of his time in this great and very respected book The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Solaris is not the ordinary Sci Fi, and it is not a film for the ordinary viewer. First, the film plays with viewers almost immediately as the intimacy of the camera work pulls you right into the set. It is like those dreams where you are both dreamer and dreamed. Clooney is superb. I've never seen him work like this, in a loose, almost extemporaneous fashion. The script barely holds clues and so a lot of work is involved for the viewer, which is probably why this film just slips by most people. Physics, with strong references to 2001, and philosophy all play across the dialogue making this a puzzle you will want to come back to over and over again.
0767819659|1.0|Well, what can I say this movie was a complete joke. The acting of the eight year old madeline was average. She had no spunk. Can you blame her as it was her debut movie. The other actors let her down also. You gotta roll with the punches hazza jones. This actress has gotta have some bad reviews or she'll cry when she's older and gets one. That girl is gonna be famous as I heard she's got better at the old acting lark( she stared in an o so recent production of Joseph as second narator ). Anyway no one should buy it as she doesn't profit and it was on ty on saturday ( channel 5). lastly what a GREAT movie.
B000002LCI|5.0|I was in my early teens when my home city went crazy about Depeche Mode, and this particular album. However, I was a true metalhead at that time, and anything lighter than Slayer was absolutely out of my sphere of interest. It was much later, through revolutionary &quot;One Second&quot; by Paradise Lost, through Depeche Mode's guitar-driven &quot;Ultra&quot;, that I came to appreciate &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; like this album fully deserved.<br />No matter what some say, to me this is one of those perfect albums in my collection. It's perfect because it doesn't have a single weak track in it. The songwriting is excellent, and every song has its distinctive mood and melody, that will sound in your head for hours. This music is a blend of gothic depressed darkness and melodic accessibility and imaginative rhythming of synth-pop. But it never gets repetitive, because the variety of the songs is so good. From a danceable &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot;, to grandiose &quot;Sacred&quot;, to melodic melancholy of &quot;Little 15&quot;, to disturbing instrumental piece &quot;Pimpf&quot;, this record has got it all. The band demonstrates imaginative use of synthesizers, and David Gahan's voice strikes with depth and sensuality. This album is not actually dancing music, but rather is intended to be appreciated through thought. Intellectual electronic music, if you wish.<br />I think that through these years &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; managed to keep its appeal and beauty, and unless you hate this particular genre, you'll like it, just like I did eventually.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist is one of those movies you can watch over and over again with the same feelings each time. It is a movie where everything is interesting because there is a sense of despair and you don't know what will happen.<br />The Pianist basically centers around a man escaping a ghetto. This man, a pianist, travels from house to house in search of a place to hide. The movie has a great pace to it. Just when you start getting bored of a house, a new interesting scene takes place. I've seen this movie several times and it never fails to be breath-taking. <br />The one thing going through my mind is, &quot;Why didn't any of the Jews fight back?&quot; Well, this movie will likely have you wondering what you would do in the pianist's situation. <br />To receive 4 stars from critics a movie has to be either the best picture of the year or extremely good. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers both received 3 stars. Terminator 2 recieved 3 stars. I am not surprised to see that The Pianist receieved 4 stars as it is probably one of the best movies of all time.
B000000XCH|5.0|Given their legendary status today it is difficult to believe that Creedence Clearwater Revival was widely regarded as a rather \\"light weight\\" band in its time.  Some of rock's more celebrated tastemakers even turned up their noses and pronounced Creedence Clearwater Revival a bubblegum act.  \\"After all, what are their little pop songs compared with Jimi Hendrix?  The Beatles?  Jefferson Airplane?\\"  As time has gone by, Creedence Clearwater Revival has stood with the best of them.  Unfortunately, like most of the great 1960's rock bands, Creedence Clearwater Revival would not survive long into the next decade.  The Beatles were no more by the spring of 1970.  Hendrix would die in the Fall of the same year.  Jim Morrison died in the early Summer of 1971.  And Creedence Clearwater Revival disintegrated by 1972.  In spite of the fact that for years all of the band members lurked in obscurity (John Fogerty deliberately so), with the release of their very first greatest hits compilation, Creedence Gold, their stature has only grown and their song catalogue has traveled well over the years.<br />Unlike most, Creedence Clearwater Revival has been served very well by the various \\"best of\\" packages that have been issued over the years.  So why bother with the original albums?  Individual cases can be made for the others; but Cosmo Factory is one of the greatest rock albums made.  With its kind of cheesy cover it is easy to misjudge Cosmos Factory as a piece of junk.  But appearances are deceiving.  Inside are eleven cuts which have burned their way into the modern American songbook.<br />\\"Run Through The Jungle\\" and \\"Up Around The Bend\\" were put out over the radio as a pair and were the first songs the public heard off the album.  The radio DJ at the time explained that the record company was trying to find out which song the public liked so that they could issue a single.  As it turned out both were popular which aided the sales of the album itself.  This started a cascade \\"hits\\" from Cosmos Factory-five from one album in all.  The remaining six cuts began to have lives of their own on the fledgling FM album rock stations all over the country.<br />\\"Travelin' Band\\" was wildly popular.  \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\" was so universally appealing that country music quickly adopted the song as one of its own.  \\"Who'll Stop The Rain\\" became almost transcendental as 1970 saw one of the most terrible and traumatic periods of the Vietnam War.  \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" struck us as particularly cool running at over eleven minutes-revamped as it was into the swamp rock idiom.  Even kids who weren't drawn to Motown loved the song.<br />\\"Ramble Tamble\\" was basically built around a single riff; but what a hell of a riff it is.  We tend to regard \\"Before You Accuse Me\\". \\"Ooby Dooby\\" and \\"My Baby Left Me\\" as mere covers and album fillers.  Long time listening, however, shows this assessment underestimates their appeal and warmth.  Their use anticipated by a few years the revival of 1950's era rock in the 1970's.  Finally, \\"Long As I Can See The Light\\" has grown to be a sentimental favorite although it has never been a \\"hit\\" on the popular charts or the FM play list.<br />Cosmos Factory caught sense of the time.  It looked back to the uneasy recent past, picking up what it could, and moved forward to a bright but uncharted and uncertain future.  Looking back, no one could have told you what was to happen.  The Vietnam War ended with nothing anyone on any side of the controversy could be proud of.  Race relations went on to become more angry and bitter.  The much-touted \\"Age Of Aquarius\\" was found to be an empty promise.  Musically, the \\"Next Beatles\\" never came.  Indeed, the music of the 1970's was a subject of deep disappointment at the time.  (Although assessments for the music of that era have grown more positive.)

055321277X|5.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was an awesome book.  It was so awesome because it was so visual.  What I mean by this is that all through the book, even though the characters in the novel were not able to describe him, it was written in a way that I was able to picture Hyde's face. I could just see his ugly face. <BR>Also, the idea of someone who is able to change themselves completey by just drinking a potion is an awesome concept(although the change was not what Dr. Jekyll wanted).  I also enjoy the fact that the main character kills himself in the end.  That doesn't happen in most stoies and it gave this story a great twist.    <BR>I wouldn't change a thing about this book and would reccommend to any reader Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
1843910705|3.0|This book was not the best book I have ever read, nor is it the worst.  There were many interesting aspects about it, but others were vague.  It had a very weak beginning and was hard to get into, but after the first couple of chapters, it really was interesting.  I would reccomend it to people who enjoy mysteries and a sort of horror.
B000000JO3|5.0|IF YOUR FAVOURITE BAND ARE AFI AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU ADORE DAVEY HAVOK then you must buy this album. Minor Threat is the band that effected Davey Havok's and changed Davey Havok's life the most...it is true. he said. i read an interview with him on the internet...it's TRUE. this band practically helped the straight edge movement become even more famous, and this band prove that you don't have to be all drugs, alcohol and sexed out to be punk rock. that is so f**king stupid and clich to think that. <BR>Davey Havok also recommended this album. so people buy this...<BR>also..may i say...that AFI's early stuff (not ont he albums tho, the rare stuff) sounds quite similar (\\"track 13\\"), to Minor Threat. believe me people..please..if any davey havok adoring people are out there reading this review...you will regret it if you don't buy it...hey...i've PRACTICALLY got it, mate!
B0001Z53CY|5.0|This is a solid rap album, if you are a fan of the genre, definitely buy this cd, and if you are a fan of shady/aftermath, there is no reason not to have it!!! It is alot more serious than Devil's Night and D12 has really improved. If this is a taste of whats to come with Em's new album, better watch out people!!!
055321277X|4.0|Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde was an okay book.  It was just okay because I thought that having most of the novel told through the eyes of a man, Mr. Utterson, who would not have been part of the story except for being Jekyll's lawer, was a little different than the way I'm used to hearing the story told.<BR>However, when Mr. Danvers was murdered for no reason, I felt that the story has gotten my attention.  The act of senseless violence was definitly a great point in the book.  <BR>I will tell people who might this book that if they enjoy reading about a scientist who is just on the wrong side of strange, but want a book easily read, to read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
B00009Z574|5.0|Sure, The Yes Album, Fragile, CTTE and GFTO will forever be their crowning achievements...I won't argue with you on that point. But for you supposed Yes fans who bad-mouth this album, I have to say I think you're a bunch of idiots.      Sure, the production is a little shaky compared to the old stuff, but for anyone who has actually taken the time to become proficient on an electric guitar, bass, drums or keyboards, the playing is amazing...period.  I personally feel this and Relayer may be Chris Squire's best overall bass performances.     I'll never understand why this one never got its due.  Like Steve Howe often says, the \\"classic\\" Yes sound is all about melody, and this disc is chock full of wonderful, original melodies.   I can't say enough good things about this disc...especially when all we have from them so far in the 21st century is tired retreads of the past like Magnification.
0671027344|2.0|This book stands out in my mind as a classic example of trying too hard.  Way too hard, as a matter of fact.  It is overly sappy, pretentious, and far too unbelievable to ever connect with anyone who isn't a product of the Nirvana generation.  The entire book is a blatant attempt at pandering to whiny Gen-Xers(MTV books anyone?).  Chbosky wastes no time getting down to business, what with the first-on-the-checklist theme of suicide that appears early on and such.  If it isn't apparent, I don't have the same flair for [adultry] as other people my age. I was 16 when I read it and even then I didn't buy into the general message or lack thereof that this work puts on the table.  This novel is just paint-by-numbers teen angst with a protagonist so fractured he seems to be a patchwork of every \\"geek\\" and \\"loser\\" stereotype that exists.  When I was a freshman I didn't have the benefit of getting stoned with my tragically hip senior buddies and having [adult relations] with upperclass girls on what seems like a weekly basis.  Take it from a real social programming error, Charlie isn't as much of an outcast as Chbosky would have you believe.  But, does that make me extremely screwed up and worthy of writing a pretentious teen-angst would-be magnum opus?  No, and no.  It gets 2 stars for the Pink Floyd reference though.
B000003TA4|1.0|How can an intelligent person listen to this garbage and say it is good music.  The only half decent thing to come out of nirvana was Dave Grohl and that's pushing it!!!  I play guitar and for my very first class I learned how to play Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come As You Are, and I mastered them both, my FIRST CLASS!!!  Their instrumentals are so damn easy a blind person could play them with only one finger on each hand.  The guitars and bass are horrible, where are the guitar solos???  For any guitartist to even be considered decent he has to atleast be able to solo/shred.  The drums are mediocore on average, decent at best, and the lyrics seem like Dr. Sesus wrote them.  I do admit they were revolutionary, but it was not for the better of music.  They degrated music into mindless noise with no writing or guitar skills at all and as we all know the insturments are the most important part of a band.  If they aren't good then the band will not be.  Nobody can sit here and argue about how today's bands influenced by them are better than pre-nirvana bands.  If you want good music that requires the band to actually have talent listen to Guns N' Roses, Old Metallica, Old Slayer, Megadeth, Pantera, and most classic rock bands i.e. Led Zepplin, Jimi Hendrix.  Again if you want talentless and mindless crap go ahead and rot your brain away with this junk.

B0000CABBW|5.0|This is a good touching movie experience. The story, the actress, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the real people in the movie, the breathtaking countryside of New Zealand, all very beautiful together... the theme may be an old one, or even clich, but the old story never wore out its light if told in such a magic, wonderfully refreshing way...It's not just about a girl's unflagging spirit or female empowerment, in a way it's a heart-felt celebration of humanity which touch us all...

0440178002|5.0|I've read between 200 and 300 books in my life and I only remember a handful of them. This book has been filed into my perminant databank. Every time I see Shogun in a store or hear someone talking about it, my heart leaps. When first picking up the book a common thought is &quot;My GOD! It's two-thousand pages!&quot; but as soon as you start reading it you wish it was three-thousand. Better yet, four-thousand...no, five-thousand...At any rate. It's hard to hate any of the charectors in this book, they are all explained thouroughly, all with their own vices and clever. And clever is the word! All of the 'people of power' have the very real and necissary cleverness that just leaves you aghast. Few books truely touch people and stay with them forever, but Shogun will be a part of ever reader forever. I laughed, I cried, I was so gosh darned glad it was part of a series =)
B00004SVID|4.0|This set really shows how good Floyd was live. Gilmour is one of the most underrated rock guitarists, I feel, but on this he really shreds it, on par with Clapton or Jimmy Page. His style is much more understated, though, so don't expect fireworks.<BR>That said, my one complaint is that this isn't from a single show. They  picked the best takes from the shows in LA, New York, London and Dortmund and pieced together a complete Wall. To me, this is artistically dishonest. Having heard most of the Wall performances, I know they could have easily released, say, 2/27/80 or 2/28/80 and still had release-worthy performances. For me, knowing it wasn't all one show kind of ruins it, but it still is an excellent document of one of, if not THE best live band ever.
6304595247|2.0|I'm quite familiar with the book, and I think the actors did a good job depicting its stormy and self-destructive passions.  However, I was continually distracted by the poor quality of the sets, costumes, and hairstyles. The lintel of the Wuthering Heights house door--shown close up suspiciously detached from the rest of the house--bears a date of 1501.  The house, when shot from outside as a whole, is late Victorian gothic fantasy gingerbread, probably a real mansion built by a wealthy industrialist. Although if the rock garden outside it is real the landscape artist should be shot. The interiors do not relate to the rest of the house, and some--particularly the rude stone fireplace in the kitchen--are probably purpose-built sets.  Cathy Earnshaw's box bed appears to have been concocted from a circa 1905 oak wardrobe.  The Art Nouveau decoration on the double doors is a dead giveaway.  The female leads have purely late 20th-century faces, hairstyles, and mannerisms. &quot;Shot on location on the moors&quot; this film may be.  But, although the moors are fine, the rest of the visual aspects will damage the film for viewers who are sensitive to such things.
055321277X|4.0|This was a great book to me.  Partly because of the shortness of the novel.  The book also was interesting because, if I had never heard the story before, I would not have been able to make the connection between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde until the end of the book.  <BR>     It was also very easily read  because it grabs your attention, and I can't explain how, is able to keep it.  With the exception of the huge part of the novel where Utterson speaks of Dr. Jekyll being locked in his laboratory, although an important part of the plot, the book kept my attention.  <BR>     I enjoyed reading this book and would reccommend it to anyone with an interest in science fiction or the abnormal.
B0000060NH|5.0|I don't care for What's Goin On, or most of Marvin gaye's material for that mattter- heresy! I know, I know... Just never cared for him so much. But I love this strange, pained, noirish jewel of a soundtrack. Probably because it's mostly instrumental. Gaye's voice an lyrics always struck me as s bit overwrought, bordering on affectatious- make of that what you will... I go more for funk and jazz than R&amp;B; the urban yodeling school of vocal delivery.<br />I've never seen Trouble Man, but I listen to this all the time! In terms of the mood- it veers from sounding like a 40's Bogart detective film to (how apropos) 70's blaxploitation (with the tinsel horns)to damn near something that could have been released a week ago... Some of the tracks (T plays is cool, for example, with those thick, bone-breaking drum beats and the slick synth mixing tight with the sax- sounds like a band boxing it out- I LOVE how you expect a cymbal at the end of the stuttered tom-tom beat fill but the drummer must have left them in the van, no cymbals! It's unexpected and sweet as hell!!!!) sound so modern- they sound like they could have been put down by a R&amp;B genius yesterday.<br />The jazzy interludes are deft and restrained with lush strings and evoactive sax. The bluesier momenst work well too- My only minor beef with this is that it clocks in at a little under 40 minutes... wish there were more.<br />Cleo's Apt with the cooing 'wooo-wooh-wooos' is seductively gorgeous, a fave. This is one of those albums you can write to or read to or kick back to, wash dishes, go running, lift, clean your car- it's infectious and immediate and dark as pitch.<br />Recommended for all who love marvin, funky jazz, laid-back R&amp;B, or bleak, anguish-laden groovy music!
1592400876|1.0|I suppose it would be a bit unfair to compare Eats, Shoots and Leaves to the old Monty Python advice on how to play the flute (\\"you blow in here and move your fingers up and down the outside\\"), but only a bit.   There are twenty or so pages of usable information, of the stultifyingly basic sort you can find in a middle-school grammar book.   The rest consists of forced jollity,  embarrassing paeans to various punctuation marks (\\"But colons and semicolons--well, they are in a different league, my dear!  They give such a lift!\\"), a bit of not-too-dull history, and shallow evocations of famous writers.   One is left wishing Truss took a zero-tolerance approach to literature or elementary logic as well as punctuation.  She reminds me of those primly dressed ladies one sees at classical music recitals, who sit throughout the performance with their faces fixed in grimaces of pleasure, but then if you try to talk with them afterward it becomes clear they haven't understood a single note.  Because, of course, that's not really the point.  The point is to show oneself to be a Cultured Person Who Appreciates the Finer Things, and thus superior to those who don't.   I highly recommend this book for the class-insecure. <br />People who care about language, as opposed to people who care about looking like they care about language, would do better to read Barbara Wallraff's new book, Your Own Words.  It's wittier, less cloying, more interesting and far more sophisticated.  Truss is an amateur, Wallraff is a professional, and the difference couldn't be more obvious.  <br />Anyway, the sentence \\"I'm a legitimate punctuation mark, get me out of here,\\" which appears on page 36 of Truss, is a comma splice on both sides of the Atlantic.   It breaks the rules--not that this is necessarily wrong.  But it neatly demonstrates the fallacy of espousing a \\"zero tolerance approach\\" to any but the most banal of language questions.
B00018D44U|5.0|I have to say that I am completely irritated that people review this album and try to compare it with other artists.  Norah is in a league all her own.  Her music soothes the soul and one has to appreciate peaceful energy to get on her groove.  The duet with Dolly is amazing and anyone who does a duet with Dolly deserves many stars in my book.  It's a simple, earthy, lay back and enjoy a sunny day kind of album.  I am glad to have Norah in my life.  Please let Norah enter your life, you won't be dissapointed.

The Guitars on Drugstore really remind me of KMFDM and the synth is very awesome and agressive,reminds me a lot of Front Line Assembly.The vocals are all very clean.<br />This album took a deep breath and dived further into the underground industrial scene.<br />As much as I really like Nine Inch Nails I would have to say that this album from stabbing Westward is the best place for beginers to start if they want to get that modern Metropolis Industrial feel. <br />until later my friends
B00009ATIX|5.0|I just saw this movie recently.  I resisted seeing it because of the bad reviews but I loved it!  It isn't slow, its meditative.  I have little patience for slow movies.  This is not one of them.  Although it is a very thought provoking movie, I felt it more than I experienced it intellectually.  Unlike most movies of today, it seems to speak to the unconscious more than the conscious. Its not a typical movie.  It isn't for everyone but if you like the stillness of meditation and question things metaphysically, you will definitely like this movie.  It's the first time I have liked George Clooney's acting.  He is superb.  I'd like to see him do more unstereotypical roles.  It is a difficult film to do well and not many could. Steven Soderberg did an excellent job.
0060005688|2.0|Schwartz states that our indecision, regret, and depression is not due to our inability to prioritize, think logically or take responsiblity.  It is because we are offered too many choices.  The manufacturers and marketers are making us victims and causing our depression.  While he does provide a self help list in the last chapter, the suggestions should be obvious to the average reader.  Even if the many products and choices are at fault for our declining happiness it may be more because we expect inanimate items to fill our emotional needs which is totally unrelated to the number of choices we have available.  In sum, this book stretchs cause and effect in order to sell books to those who want to avoid responsibility for their own decisions.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I didn't know the Seabiscuit story before watching this film.  I didn't know it was an underdog story.  All I knew going in was that it was a horse movie.  I didn't expect to like it and it ended up being one of my favorite films of 2003.<br />The movie is a great story, but I enjoyed it how it was told as much as what was told.  I enjoyed the melding of stories about a too-tall Depression Era jockey who was forced to leave his family, a horse doctor with unconventional methods, and an owner.  We see how they blend as not just a business partnership, but as family.<br />We watch men and horses overcome physical and emotional hurdles to beat the unbeatable.<br />A great feel good movie.
B00003CXBH|5.0|The Mission refers to episodes in South American history usually called the 'Jesuit Reductions.'  The Jesuit order was so successful  in its mission effort that they almost succeeded in establishing native American nations strong enough to resist white invasion and exploitation.  Something similar happened in the future USA (the Flathead Indians of western Montana) and the future Canada (the Meti).  The Jesuits were attacked in Rome by their political enemies, which led to the events in the second half of the movie.<br />I'm a Vietnam veteran.  The second half made me burst into tears in front of my amazed wife.  I was surprised as much as she was.  At the time I didn't realize how badly I was affected by what is now known as PTSD.  This movie is a must-see for anyone who wants to wake up from the stupor of American consumer life.
0385507755|5.0|This book has drawn a lot of comparisons to other memoirs about alcoholism and addiction, most notably Augusten Burrough's Dry.  In my opinion, however, A Million Little Pieces is the best, most honest look at addiction ever written.<br />Frey's style (or lack thereof) is captivating and makes for interesting reading.  Many of the complaints about the book are about the style, which lacks proper punctuation, quotation marks, etc.  However, this feature adds to the sense of desperation and angst that Frey is trying to establish.<br />It is difficult to believe that Frey, at the age of 23, had become such a victim to his addiction, but nevertheless, this is a raw, unglamorous, real life look at an addict.  Addicted to everything from crack to glue, Frey struggles to sobriety, surrounding by an entertaining and bizarre cast of characters.<br />A Million Little Pieces is both amusing and terrifying.  Frey also tackles some of the myths of addiction treatment, most notably his extreme resistance to &quot;turning his life over to a higher power&quot; and joining in the standard 12 step treatment programs.  He believes, right or wrong, that he chooses his path, and he can choose not to use.  He shows remarkable strength and courage and is also a pretty good writer.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|It seems like every match this year was forced.  Goldberg/Lesnar could have been awesome but the two stalled too much.  Angle/Eddie was OK.  They're both great performers and could have done much more.  HHH/HBK/Benoit was good but a triple-threat is never as good as a one on one match up.  Last year, Angle and Lesnar put on a tremendous match and that's due to the fact that it's one on one.  WM XIX was so much better than XX.  The tag team matches were horrible.  HBK vs Y2J is the best match I've ever seen in my life.  If you've never seen it, I'm sorry.  The extras on the disc are worth the price alone.  Seeing Hulk Hogan lace his boots up along side Kurt Angle is just priceless.  These guys leave their heart and soul in the ring everytime out and I respect them for that.
0142000663|4.0|So you're probably wondering, why such a downer title, and yet he gave it four stars?  Well, if you're willing to be your own editor, you can turn this into a terrific novel or into a moving essay.  But, Steinbeck has combined both, and in today's time, this pairing drives down the pace of both.  Steinbeck's writing pattern is immediatly apparent:  He alternates between an essay dealing in generalities of the situation with the tale of the Joad family specifically living the conditions he has laid out in the essay.  Of course he did that, because he was trying to educate the bulk of America to the condition the migrant workers were facing in California.  If he just told Joad's story, readers might think it is a situation peculiar to only one family.  But, by pairing the Joad episodes with the broader essays, he shows that their desperate situation is shared by thousands of other families.  Each of the essay/story telling sections are easy to dissect, so I suggest the reader who is interested in the compelling story of the Joads skip the essay segments.  I read both in order, and found myself impatient with the essays and wanting to get back to the Joads.  However, the essays are beautifully and powerfully written and important in their time before Caesar Chavez, so the next time I pick up this book, I believe I will just read the essay sections, then read the Joad sections.  I also highly recommend the movie version of this book which starred Henry Fonda.  The book and movie are quite similar in their plots with some exceptions that are interesting to think about.  There are a number of minor characters and situations in the book that didn't make the movie.  One of Steinbeck's themes from the book that didn't see light of the silver screen is that the head of the family was changing from a male to female as the adversities became harder to overcome.  The movie ends on somewhat of a positive note with Henry Fonda's \\"I'll be there\\" speech.  On the other hand, the book ends with a hell-bent-for-leather finale, none of which made the movie, including the haunting climax.  And unlike the movie, the book shows no promise of a brighter future.ends with a hell-bent-for-leather finale, none of which made the movie, including the haunting climax.

B00006879E|2.0|I bought this unheard because Entertainment Weekly gave it a good review.  They said the vocals were &quot;unique&quot; and the sound was &quot;very different.&quot;  Sounds good, I thought, and ordered it.<br />Well, the &quot;unique vocals&quot; (as far as I can tell) consists of the melody jumping all over the scale; there are not any two consecutive syllables sung on the same note as far as I've noticed.  Sit a kid down in front of a piano and tell him to hit one key at a time randomly and you'll get an idea of what this is like.<br />Otherwise the music, lyrics, singer's vocal quality, etc., seems no different from any other current male group.  Nothing catchy enough to sing.  But not a bad album.  Just not as striking as I was led to believe.
B000148KK2|2.0|I am such a fan - two different people sent me this CD as a gift as soon as it came out. I literally listen to a little Diana every day. But, it won't be from this album. I always feel bad for the pop artist that decides to stretch themselves and do a lame &quot;jazz&quot; album  - but I think the waste of this jazz talent on syrupy pseudo-jazz/pop ballads is even worse. First, she and hubby should have realized there is a reason nobody buys elvis costello anymore - when was the last time he actually wrote a song somebody wanted to hear?<br />The solos are weak and uninspiring on keys and guitar. It feels more like they are doing a spontaneous composition exercise that never quite hits the mark.<br />Her voice is awesome as always, but, it seems she is trying too hard to achieve the sultry ballad crossover thing - it just doesn't seem to work. I was excited to find that she was performing in my area this summer - luckily I got the album before buying the tickets - I am not sure I could have stayed awake for the whole show.<br />I give her credit for trying new things - most of them have worked - this one didn't. Hopefully she will learn the lesson and come back &quot;swingin'&quot; with some music worthy of her talents.
B0000C1HLF|1.0|This is by far one of the worst movies to come out in a long time.  I'd rather watch a series of low budget direct-to-DVD movies than sit through this dribble again.

B0000797IO|5.0|Jennifer Aniston's work has never struck me as being either deep or watchable, but I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and engaging quality of 'The Good Girl'.<br />Aniston's character, depressed and miserable in her marriage and in her job (a dead end job that she probably only ended up with because she was undereducated, a point another reviewer below sadly missed, judging by his misinterpretation of her response to a comment by her coworker regarding 'The Catcher In the Rye'), begins a friendship with a coworker several years younger than herself. She both enjoys and fears this relationship because although it makes her happy, she is terrified that her husband will find out about it. Her anxiety and fear increases when her husband's best friend finds out about her relationship and blackmails her into having sex with him.<br />She reaches a crossroads, a point at which she must choose between the husband she loves and despises in equal measure and the relationship that she had begun with her coworker.<br />I found it intriguing that when faced with what was the most important decision of her life, she made the choice that lead her back to the existence she hated. Ultimately, neither choice probably would have made her happy but she chose the path toward the familiar, deciding that the awful life she knew was preferable to a leap into the unknown. Her decision had dramatic, tragic consequences, both at work and at home.<br />Aniston's acting was brilliant. I was amazed and completely drawn in by the film and by her performance in particular. She has a genuine talent and range I was completely unaware of, and now I'm anxious to see her future projects. 'The Good Girl' is wonderful in every aspect, from the writing to the cast, and the direction is flawless, lending a very real sense of the desolation and loneliness that is this woman's day to day existence. It's the kind of film that resonates, staying with you long after the credits roll.<br />Absolutely wonderful!

B00005OCMR|4.0|Ego vs. Id <BR>TR0N is a futuristic adventure set in a world never before seen on the motion picture screen. Steven Lisberger combined computer-generated imagery with special techniques in live-action photography that marked a milestone in optical and light effects. &quot;Steven brought to life a world where energy lives and breathes, where laws of logic are defied, where an electronic civilization thrives.&quot; (Guygg) <BR>Not only were the filming techniques ahead of its time but also the idea of computers and artificial intelligence was also unheard of. One aspect of movies that is frequently overlooked is the Director. Movies are more than just entertainment for viewers; they can also be forms of expression for the creators. Sometimes the author is aware of the message he is trying to get across, and sometimes he is not. It was out of Steven Lisberger's passion for video games that gave him the idea for TRON. I feel that he directed this movie with a very personal attachment. Perhaps there is a hidden message in this movie. That is why it is necessary to psychoanalyze Steven Lisbergers work of art. <br />Sigmund Freud is the creator of psychoanalysis. From his studies in medicine and psychology, Freud developed various techniques to uncover material that is hidden in the patient's unconscious, the source of human behavior. &quot;For Freud, the unresolved conflicts that give rise to any neurosis are the stuff of literature. A work of literature, he believes, is the external expression of the author's unconscious mind. Accordingly, the literary work must be treated like a dream.\\" (Bressler 153) Through his work, the author's unconscious is able to express its desires. According to Freud, the mind is made up of the id, ego, and super-ego. In literature, sometimes the characters and settings can take these parts. There is plenty of evidence supporting the idea that Lisberger's id and ego are portrayed as characters in the movie Tron. <br />The id is where the irrational and instinctual decisions come from. It is also contains a persons secret desires, wishes, and fears. In the movie, the id is portrayed as the Master Control Program or MCP. The id is &quot;the bad guy&quot; of the mind. In Tron, the MCP fits this description to an exact. The MCP's desire was power. He made it clear that he wanted power and that he wanted to know everything. The MCP was so determined that he did everything in his ability to ensure that he would achieve his goal. This is why he kept all the other programs in &quot;slavery&quot;, why he blackmailed his maker, and why he beamed Flynn into the computer with the intentions of killing him. The MCP's main fear was being monitored. In the movie it was made clear that the MCP was very uncomfortable with this judging by its reaction to the rumors about the new monitoring program. <br />TRON is set in two worlds: the real world, the land of flesh and blood, where a vast computer system in a communications conglomerate is controlled by a single program; and the electronic world, whose electric-and-light beings want to overthrow the program which controls their lives. At first, reality had no way of interacting with the computer world. Only the MCP was able to be omnipresent. This was a problem for the real world because the MCP was able to superimpose its own desires onto the real world and the humans had no way to truly fight back. A good example of this was when the MCP threatened to blackmail one of the humans in the &quot;real world&quot; if he did not meet its demands. The two worlds began to clash even more when Kevin Flynn was brought into the computer world. The computer world was made up of games that Flynn created and he quickly demonstrated that he was superior to &quot;programs&quot; he was matched up against. Through out the film Flynn represented reality, even while he was trapped in the computer world. The movie is basically a power struggle between the MCP and the real world. This was a clash between Steven Lisberger's ego and id. <br />During the film the two worlds were portrayed by Lisberger's Ego and Id. The computer world, his id, was made up of Lisberger's fantasies. Because he was so passionate about video games, this world was made up entirely of them. The MCP was basically his id expressing his secret desires, wishes and fears. According to Freud, Lisberger's id created this character therefore; the MCP's desires and fears could very well be Lisberger's own. <BR>The &quot;real world&quot; was Lisberger's Ego. This demonstrated his logical side and reality. That is why the &quot;real world&quot; was portrayed as being so normal in the film. According to Freud, one of the ego's main jobs is to regulate desires from the id. This is demonstrated throughout the film. The fact that Flynn was beamed into the computer world is a great example of Lisberger's ego regulating the id and making sure it didn't take over. This is why the MCP was destroyed in the end. <br />In conclusion, Tron was much more than a movie. It was Lisberger's ego and id engaged in a very heated battle. In the end the good guy won and the MCP was destroyed. This is a good sign. That means that Lisberger's ego prevailed and regulated the id like it should. If the movie would have ended with the MCP killing Flynn and gaining more power then Steve would have problem. This would mean that his id is starting to play more of a factor in his quotidian life.
B00006879E|2.0|I'm suprised that nobody has noticed this, but \\"This Love\\" is a direct rip of \\"I Will Survive\\". It's like as if they changed a few words around and kept the same rhymes and structure. Also: it has a blend of Foreigner's Blue Morning Blue Day music. I dont see why everybody gives this band 5 stars. The album is fun and really catchy, but it's mediocre. I give it a thumbs up for its catchiness, but its really unoriginal. I know \\"Harder to Breate\\" is a rip of something else, but I can't figure it out. This is an album i'd only download on mp3.
0778320448|5.0|Debbie Macomber does a superb job of weaving together a tale of women from different age groups and backgrounds. Each of the women shows moments of courage, fear, turmoil, truimph, and love.  If you were a fan of Thursday's at Eight, you'll love this book too.<BR>   The group starts out knitting a baby blanklet and ends up creating a friendship.  I loved the way each of the characters relates to each other in their struggles (health, infertility, broken relationsips, etc.).  In both little and large ways, the friendship that is created is stronger and more lasting then any of the blankets knitted.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The best and most touching music video I've seen. But don't buy it for that reason, buy it because the music is untouchable. Performed by the best of the best this is our generations music redone to perfection.<br />Since the video starts with Ravi Shankars tribute to George, titled Arpan or offering, I'll start there too. On first viewing I thought Arpan was perhaps a few minutes too long. On second viewing I was able to focus more on the musicianship and craft of the song and found myself amazed that this Indian orchestra could produce such beautiful but different music. <br />From the wonderful and heartfelt voices to Ravis daughter on sitar and everything in between this is the best display of Indian musical talent I've ever seen. Beautiful and not a minute too long.<br />The western band is loaded with superstars including Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Jools Holland, Sam Brown, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Dhani Harrison, Billy Preston, Gary Brooker (Procul Harum) and Jim Capaldi. Many others are sprinkled throughout the band. Watch the percussionist!<br />Some show highlights: <br />Sam Brown steals the show completely. Her rendition of Horse to Water showcases the soul that the best of George's songs all have. Her voice is wonderful, touching and ballsy at the same time. The band cooks on this one. This should be released as a single.<br />Paul McCartney on For You Blue. Paul does a few key numbers and then becomes a member of the band, playing in the background like everyone else. On all of his songs his voice shines. Somehow he has returned to the powerful singer he once was and perhaps even better. Ever since Flowers in the Dirt, up to Driving Rain and now in this concert Pauls voice has just gotten better and better. An amazing performance.<br />Billy Preston on Isn't It a Pity. You have to see it to believe it. Billy is the keyboardist that played with the Beatles on Let It Be and was with them for their last rooftop performance. His soulfull keyboard playing and incredible voice make this song one of the most powerful tributes to George in the concert.<br />Monty Python and crew perform The LumberJack song and Sit On My Face, very funny. Who would expect to be mooned, in The Hall of Albert, on such an occasion. Look for Tom Hanks in the Mountie group.<br />Olivia comments at the end, &quot;With Dhani on stage it looks like George got younger while the rest of us aged.&quot; Dhani has the looks and mannerisms of his father and is present during most of the concert playing and singing backup.<br />Summary: Buy the DVD. This is the best Beatle video, the best music video and the best tribute video available.

B0001GOH6Q|4.0|BIG FISH is a sleeper of a movie.  Now that may sound like an oxymoron for a Tim Burton all-stops-out fantasy gig, but for those who don't get lightheaded at the mention of this talented director's name of ilk of films, this journey has a lot of fine surprises.  Yes, this is another fantasy movie, but this time the fantasy embroiders a tender and (and all too frequent) trying examination of a father/son relationship.  Young Will Bloom is called home to Alabama (where his father is dying) from Paris where he and his pregnant wife have fled to get away from his distant father who has only conversed with Will through tall tales ('lies') to the point that the schism produced makes Will realize that he doesn't know his father at all.  Burton can't resist making visual all the tall tales so often repeated by Edward Bloom - stories of his preposterous birth, the way he met his wife, the journey to escape the little town through magic forests and 'heavenly' cites with his comrade the giant, his employment by sideshows, and his encounters with witches, odd balls, and huge fish.  These parts of the story plead patience, so overblown and non-edited they endlessly appear, but in the end the reason for telling them finds home in the coming together of the father and son in a way that leaves not a dry eye in the audience.  Burton wisely has a cast of professionals that help make this story work:  Ewan McGregor is the young Ed Bloom and Albert Finney is the elder form of the man, Billy Crudup is the son Will, Jessica Lange the Mother (Alison Lohman is her younger self), and the assorted characters are spun by the likes of Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Robert Guillaume, and an especially fine Matthew McGrory as Karl the Giant.  Endure the excesses of the first part of the film and the rewards are superb in the end!
B000059QY3|5.0|I am not a big fan of Traviata, but I am of this DVD.  Angela's singing and acting is incredible.  From the very start, she lays out the character.  She is the finest singing actress I have ever seen.  The whole production is fresh including the sets and staging.  The direction is innovative and I felt that the director wasn't relying on the old tried and true ways of handling this story.  I found myself pulled into each character on the stage.  I even got pulled into the character of Violetta's maid, Annina.  Can you belive that!  She has about five lines if that much, but what the director does for her and each character is perfection.  This is a great ensemble show with great performances from each singer.  You will not be disappointed.  I will watch it over and over and over!!!
6305622914|5.0|Without re-hashing the plot, suffice to say that this is one of the more original and accomplished feel-good films you'll ever see.  The story focuses on a bunch of lovable unemployed lads in Sheffield, England, following the collapse of the local steel industry (the film opens with one of those &quot;Progress Is Today&quot; film-reels we all watched in elementary school and sets a perfect tone for the rest of the film).  Their rallying cry:  an all-male strip tease.  The set-up:  minimal dancing talent and a low beefcake factor.  <br />Instead of a bunch of caricatures, &quot;TFM&quot; gives us a fully realized ensemble, even with some touching scenes from the women who inhabit the fringes of the film.  The dense accents give the flick a delightful authenticity , and the cast has some wonderful comic timing as well as the ability to pluck the heartstrings at the right moments. <br />&quot;TFM&quot; builds from a great premise to one of the best closing scenes in recent years -- you'll either be on your feet cheering or on the floor laughing, and maybe both.<br />The DVD offers good sound and picture quality, but there is a notable lack of extras.  Still, better a good flick and no extras than a mediocre flick and a bunch of goodies.
B00006879E|5.0|I bought this cd because I liked the first 2 singles I heard off this album, Harder To Breathe &amp; This Love, and was pleasantly surprised when I liked all the other songs on the album even better than those 2 songs!! I think it's great!!
B000068TPN|4.0|&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is a U-turn for American films about Vietnam.  For years, the best flicks about the war highlighted the nation's disillusionment and cynicism about our involvement in Southeast Asia -- &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; &quot;Platoon,&quot; &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; and &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; leave the viewer bereft, wondering how to deal with that ball of ice in your stomach.  But each of these films looks back with regret, wtih &quot;if we only knew the truth at the beginning, we wouldn't have gotten involved over there in that hideous war.&quot;  <br />&quot;We Were Soldiers,&quot; on the other hand, captures the America at the beginning of the Vietnam conflict.  Most of the soldiers are the earnest, happy-go-lucky young guys we got in the John Wayne war films . . . before they go off to war, they sing and dance with their wives and girlfriends, and they show an innocent heroism under fire.  Only the senior officers, played by Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott, know the truth about war and how savage the Vietnam conflict will be. Mel, as the senior commander, gets a bit jingoistic at times, but that his depiction is apparently dead-on for those who know the real-life commander (who was a consultant on the film).  Sam Elliott, as the grizzled second-in-command, is a wonder -- he stalks the movie with a barely concealed fury, terrifying his own soldiers, but has a moment of exquisite tenderness and leadership with one of his boys.  <br />Like the young soldiers, the audience gets its education on how the conflict will be -- the Vietnamese, who are given a humanity rarely seen in Vietnam movies, still charge with near-suicidal determination.  We see napalm in its hideous applications.  We see the terror of a unit cut off from the main force overnight.  We are stunned by seeing what men can endure and we despair because no man should have to experience the hell of that battlefield.  <br />The movie truly shines with its parallel storyline of the wives and girlfriends back in Georgia who wait for news of their loved ones in combat . . . or, more accurately, pray that they do not receive news.  The movie's most touching scenes revolve around the delivery of the &quot;We regret to inform you . . . &quot; telegrams announcing the death of another soldier to their families.  Anyone who can watch these scenes without heartache has not heart.<br />The DVD also contains some nice extras, including deleted scenes with director's commentary.  It's always interesting to hear why certain scenes didn't make it into a good story, and while some of the deleted scenes were quite good, it's hard to quibble with the explanation.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|The 'oldies song' made into a cool new beat dub that was playing whilst Uma was watching the movie in bed with her daughter is THE ZOMBIES 'she's not there' manipulated into the jam 'About Her' on this here soundtrack by MALCOLM MCLAREN. Hope that helps!<br />The film was amazing, have'nt heard the soundtrack as a whole except in the film but so I can post this, I'll give it a 5 for fun!
038572179X|4.0|I was really looking forward to reading this novel, after hearing so much about it & liking the title (and presumed subject matter). I'd read McEwan's 'Amsterdam' earlier and while it had also had a surprise ending, I found it just way too clever. 'Atonement' has much more substance to it than 'Amsterdam,' but I was left with the feeling that McEwan may be too clever for his own good. I WAS really surprised at the end, and it made me think, and I haven't forgotten the book, but the huge twist in the last few pages seemed just a little too contrived.<br />I also feel that I probably should have read the book much more slowly. It's complex, and demands a lot of the reader. But one of the reasons I was reading it fast, in the first part particularly, was that I disliked the young 13 year old narrator, Briony, in the extreme--I found her so self-indulgent and histrionic. If only she had been more likeable! I didn't mind the details in Part One or the slow moments there, but I did get a little bogged down in Part Two, war stories at Dunkirk where nothing much happens, though I did understand (I think!) why McEwan was including this section.<br />I think probably McEwan isn't my type of author--he's too academic (though I do love good literary fiction!), too clever and dry, and just way too detached, for me. I felt as if I was being held at arm's length during this whole book, that it didn't draw me in emotionally (and I long to be emotionally involved with a book's characters, like to be pulled into a story, another world). I felt more like I was on the outside all the time with 'Atonement', looking in, face pressed against the glass, and thus distanced.<br />I'm not sorry I read this novel, though--it's well-crafted, and I can see from the reader's guide that I obviously missed some of the symbolism in it or text that I didn't get sorted out. I've thought of rereading it, but don't think I will--I don't think I could stand the young Briony again, for one thing!<br />I do see how some people could give this novel 5 stars and why others gave it 3 (but not less than that! This is a serious and ambitious book...). McEwan's style isn't for everyone, and not everyone should be reading this book either; I myself wonder if I want to try some of his earlier novels, and think, to be fair, that I ought to try one more before I give up on him entirely.do see how some people could give this novel 5 stars and why others gave it 3 (but not less than that!

B00003CXB4|5.0|Disney's best film achievment, The Lion King truely is the king of all animated films.  The movie is awe-inspiring and touching.  It teaches valuable lessons that anyone can foreward into their own life.  The movie itself is beautiful.  Hans Zimmer's score is one of the most brilliant that I have heard.  The animation is goregous, I do not see how anyone could have done it in just three years.  Everything about it is awesome.  It may be a little violent for kids, but it isn't overwhelming.  I highly reccomend this film for anyone and everyone.
B00003CY5J|4.0|This movie is a blast and a great take on a heist plot to boot! DeNiro and Norton are  believable and likeable in these juicy rolls. Brando brings humor and emotional depth to a small but vital role. My only gripe is what's up with giving Angela Bassett such a small part in the story? This movie could've been a lot more fun if her character presented a twist in the romantic storyline or better yet, the heist storyline. A beautiful cast delivers the goods. The lighting, incorporated jazz, and editing are tight. The technical details help push a well planned story and also create an experience for the viewer that doesn't confuse or insult your intelligence. Nice.
B00006F2WY|4.0|My oldest sister got the original vinyl album. I was intruiged by the cover (a glorious color photo of an empty Royal Albert Hall) and inside picture (a grainy black and white picture of Deep Purple surrounded by the orchestra in front of an overflowing Albert Hall). When I heard the album, I couldn't quite believe my ears. Here's the orchestra creating beautful sounds, there comes the band crashing in with heavy metal! And it all somehow hangs together!<br />Recorded 35 years ago, two-thirds of that magical evening is now avaible (still missing: the opener Sixth Symphony of conductor and composer Malcolm Arnold). After the opening symphony, Deep Purple then came on for a short 3 song set (which was not featured on the vinyl album, but is included on the CD reissue). That set is incredible: Hush, the instrumental Wreck That Neck, and the then-still unreleased, unrecorded and unknown Child in Time (explaining why there was no reaction from the crowd when Ian Gillan announces the song).<br />Last but not least comes the Jon Lord-composed &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;. The 1st Movement is still my favorite, because it takes it time setting the table and then magically making the way for an instrumental hard rocking jam by the band, with a blazing solo by Ritchie Blackmore. The 2nd Movement is my least fave of the three, as it is too timid (and reminding me at one point of the Moody Blues, argh!!). The 3rd Movement however is explosive, and includes an amazing drum solo by Ian Paice, only to then go to an incredible explosive final of band and orchstra. Wow!<br />A year after this album Deep Purple started its string of now-classic albums &quot;In Rock&quot;, &quot;Fireball&quot; and &quot;Machine Head&quot;. However, the &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot; album is just as adventurous in its own right. I &quot;borrowed&quot; the album from my sister, and sure am glad to have it on CD now. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!
B00005YU1O|1.0|People, really, I have a minor in Philosophy, and the film is just as boring as sitting through a lecture of Immanuel Kant's Hermeneutics.  It's like they ran about with a digital camera, imported the entire thing into their Mac and hit &quot;animate.&quot;<br />All this film does is speak in circles of nothing of proof.  Its all boring theory.<br />Imagine cornering your local philosophy professor, asking him to talk endlessly about what he's teaching this semester, and there you have this film.<br />If you're interested in philosophy, I recommend you enroll yourself in college and take the courses.  The understanding of very heavy concepts are better explained in this environment.  God forbid anyone assimilate the knowledge instead of just sitting there like a bobble-head, pretending to understand what's being spoken.<br />You'll learn nothing from this film.<br />Mike
B0000D96NW|5.0|I recently got into Machine Head after rediscovering The Burning Red in my collection.  That cd, although not as good as this one, is one of the best metal/nu-metal cds i have heard.  I am not even a fan of nu-metal but that stuff is nu-metal done right.    Now we get Through the Ashes of Empires.  This whole cd is an amazing achievement in the metal genre.  Not only is it heavy and technically well done, but it gets in your head and keeps you listening to the cd over and over again.     One thing that distinguishes MH in a heavily saturated industry, is their mature approach.  Every member is extremely talented.  There are great guitar solos, amazing vocals, and some of the best, most concrete drumming i have heard.  Don't ask me about bass, i have no clue.  But this cd is truly impressive.  Here is a breakdown of the songs.    1. Imperium: 5/5, one of the best metal songs i have heard in years.  Very heavy and epic with a great mix of speed metal and heavy metal.  This song gets stuck in your head and you don't want to get it out!    2. Bite the Bullet: 5/5, another amazing song.  Very catchy and short enough to not get repetitive.  Hopefully this'll be their second single.    3.  Left Unfinished: 4.5/5 great song.  it has the best line in the whole cd! i think you'll know when you hear it!    4. Elegy: 3/5 this is my least favorite song but it is still good.  It is just a little too generic for the rest of the cd. it isn't bad though.    5. In the Presence of My Enemies: 4/5 Another good song. it is a 5 minute song stuck in a 7 minute song's structure.  They could have trimmed it down.  But it is still really good.    6. Days Turn Blue to Gray: 5/5, this song builds really well and has an awesome part later in the song where the drummer does a sweet beat on high hat.  The chorus is great too.  One of the best songs on the album.    7. Vim: 4.5/5, An interesting song with amazing drumming in a few parts.  It would have got a 3.5 but being a drummer I am biased.8. All Falls Down: 4.5/5, it has some great transitions and is overall a great song with amazing vocals.    9. Wipe the Tears: 4.5/5, very emotional with great lyrics.  it is very raw and a great metal song.    10. Descend the Shades of Night: 5/5, now this is WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!  An 8 minutes song that keeps you listening from beginning to end.  If Imperium weren't on this album i would say hands down this is the best and my favorite song on the album.  It is a perfect ending to an impressive album.    For the love of metal buy this album!  In my opinion it is better than Burn My Eyes and MH best cd to date.  If you like bands like Sepultura, Slayer, Nevermore, Fear Factory and even Metallica i think you will like these guys.  What sets this cd apart from all the others is the musicality and vocals.  Buy it, you will not be dissapointed.
0385336810|5.0|I am not normally a fan of romantic comedy but this had the perfect touch. You meet the man of your dreams on a plane, and he turns out to be your new boss when you are back at work on Monday morning.<br />Only instead of telling a pack of lies to impress, she blurts out the whole truth about everything and every one in her life.<br />There are the white lies we tell, and things we don't say at all, to avoid hurting the people we care about, and then there are huge whoppers. Emma falls into the first category. Jack is so secretive she can't get him to talk at all.<br />When he finally does, he tells all about her, because he loves her. But with the most shcoing results.<br />The dramatic tension and romantic tension in the book is far better than any of her Shopaholic books. And I find Emma much more charming. the cast of characters who all get their comeuppance in one way or the other are priceless. One thing is for sure, you will never look at lawyers or little white lies the same way again, let alone thong underwear!<br />I loved Jack-he actually had personality compare with Luke in her other books.  Fast paced and extremely funny! Enjoy!
B00003CXDD|4.0|Willow is not the perfect movie. It suffers from some of the annoying film conventions of the time, such as stupid chase scenes and shots of the baby making editorial faces (yawning when everyone else is scared, being disgusted, etc. which reminded me of some really awful dog-cop movie) and one unconvincing projectile-vomit. The special effects do date the movie, but progress has to come from somewhere.<br />I wrote this review mainly to put in my two cents on the originality and plot. Willow has a lot of fairy-tale elements, such as an evil queen (this was not invented by Snow White), an unlikely hero, prophecy fulfilled by a(n often orphaned) child. That is not borrowing someone else's original material, that is using _archetypes_, which in literature is considered fair game. I do not understand why people are comparing this to Lord of the Rings for originality--LoTR follows the books.<br />You get the gist of the plot mostly from Willow's perspective. He doesn't understand all the details, he just has a mission and he's following his nose. If you can see something as a serious plot hole, you can probably come up with a reasonable explanation for it. Example: requiring that the baby's soul be exiled rather than just killing her. If her soul is released, she could be reborn and the threat would remain. <br />As for the acting, I thought the characters had some wonderful interactions in the film. I love the scene where Willow rescues Mad Mardigan, and I love the sorceress's little white lie. Their bickering really works for me, and I chose to enjoy the little brownies with their French accents not following Faerie stereotypes. They were more happy-go-lucky and careless with magic than I would have made them, but they were pretty marginal so it didn't matter. The princess came off to me as just following Mom's orders rather than being evil in her own right, so I didn't mind when she changed sides. It is not normal to follow Mom's orders forever. In a nutshell, I thought the acting was appropriate for who the characters were supposed to be. It's been a while so I don't remember the &quot;scary-looking&quot; guy, but I felt it is more powerful to let the queen have all the evil anyway.<br />If you spend more energy attacking the film than you do enjoying it, you will voluntarily be missing out.
B000000OMP|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best hard-rock albums of all time. Whitesnake might have been a little reminiscent of Led Zeppelin, but they definitely had their own thing going. David Coverdale is an amazing vocalist, right up there with Chris Cornell and....well, Robert Plant LOL:) A lot of heavy music from the 80's has been (and rightfully should be) dismissed as hairspray and fluff, including 'Snake's later albums, in my opinion. But this is just a great rock album, period. Not one song on it stinks. Great vocals, musicianship and heart. If you only buy one Whitesnake CD, make it this one!
B00001PE4D|5.0|I thought this movie was wonderful. I could see how they were trying to make it feel old, rugad and proper, but still have the sexed up world that we live in today. It is a fact that we all must face, sex sells- and it's here to stay, there's not much you can do about it. This movie did an excellent job doing just that- selling it. Yet it wasn't trashy, whorey or totally nasty. (...) This movie was very good, and I reccomend you see it, it will open your mind, and make you laugh.

B00005RY7X|5.0|The funnest album to be released ever. The music is absolutely fabulous. It is crunching speed guitars with some synths thrown around. Andrew screams like a maniac about parties, fun and girls. He is like the savior of true rock n' roll. he sounds nothing like nu metal despite the release date. The best songs on the album are Party Hard, Got To Do It, Party Till You Puke, and Girls Own Love. But there is no such thing as a bad song on this album. No, sir there is no such thing. Andrew WK shows it is possible to sing about fun and happiness without being a hippie idiot.
B0001I55OC|1.0|A red flag went off in my head when I saw Richard Donner's name on this clunker, 'cause since when does Richard Donner do science fiction???  Yes, Donner was terrific with SUPERMAN, but that was really fantasy not science fiction and it was over 25 years ago!!!<br />Another red flag is Paul Walker, another of those better than average looking below average actors that Hollywood occasionally tries to pump up into a movie star, and he's as lousy in this as he's been in everything else I've seen him in.<br />If you want to see some good time travel science fiction, see George Pal's THE TIME MACHINE with Rod Taylor or Irwin Allens' tv show, THE TIME TUNNEL, but avoid this movie!!!<br />Chari Krishnan<BR>RESEARCHKING
B000002B7U|5.0|Ozzy is the godfather of metal, no denying it. this is one of his coolest albums. He went glam for this one (After all, this was 1986). it was a huge smash and I can see why. Ozzy opens with the blasting BUM BUM BUM beats of the title track and then goes into a fury against heavy metal-predjudiced squares in Never Know Why and revels about the atom bomb in Thank God For The Bomb. Then comes a slew of good songs, but closes with the spectacular Shot in the Dark. That is one of the Ozzman's best songs ever. If you don't own this album, you are not a true metalhead.
B00004R9A3|5.0|I enjoy Walt Disney films and shows on television and had grown to like the tv show The Wonderful World of Disney.  I had not been to Disneyland yet, but had seen pictures and images on television.  Bedknobs and Broomsticks was probably the first Walt Disney motion picture I saw at a drive-in.  I had never seen a magical film like this.  To be honest, I wasn't too taken by Lansbury (I like her now!).   I was probably thinking of a different actress on another bewitching show.  But I enjoyed the special effects and the flying brass bed.  The knights with invisible people inside stuck in my mind.  They had an exhibit at the drive-in snack bar where the knights suit of armor was displayed.  I was too young to figure it all out about the special effects, but what was nice is that the Walt Disney Company could make magical films and give me nice dreams.  I have learned to respect all that is Disney.  Now I am 41 and have an almost grown daughter.  I just saw the restored version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  I found the film to still be a delight.  Like Angela Lansbury!  Still like Walt Disney films.  Still like the fantasy of it all. And have been to Disneyland many times.  Wouldn't we all like to have a bedknob that could do that.  That poor scruffy black cat.  I did have a nice black cat for 13 years.  <BR>  The 30th Anniversary edition is the restored version with nearly 23 minutes of footage found and added into the film.  This time the film is more fun, enjoyable and easier to understand.  At the end of the film is a featurette with Angela Lansbury and the Sherman Brothers.<BR> Trvia Note: Did you know the Walt Disney Company and Angela Lansbury have the same birthdate?   Shorter prints run 98 min. and 117 min.  This newly restored version runs 2 hours, 19 minutes.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|I cannot say anything that has not already been said about this masterpiece, but I do wish that the second disc had included &quot;You Gave Your Love To Me Softly&quot; from the Angus soundtrack. As it was recorded in 1995 though, I would hope that someday it will make its way onto a remaster of 1996's Pinkerton.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|D12 comes back to the scene with their sophmore release. How does it stand up? Pretty damn well if you ask me. I've been hearing a lot of negative stuff about the album here at Amazon, but I think those reviews need to be disregarded as this is easily CD of the year (So far - of course).<BR>Here's my breakdown of the tracks:<br />1. Git Up: Lyrically insane. Some of the most out of control lyrics I've ever heard with a solid beat in the background. A great showcase song. Rating: A-<BR>2. Loyalty: Easily one of the best on the album. Tight all around and an appearance from Obie Trice. Rating: A<BR>3. Just Like You: I really like this song. Some funny lyrics from Bizarre and a solid beat. Rating: A-<BR>4. I'll Be Damned: Another one of my favorites on the album. A great hook and some tight lyrics. Rating: A<BR>5. Dude: Just a skit. Nothing special. Rating: N/A<BR>6. My Band: The first single and extremely funny. Especially the part at the end with the mexican, umm, &quot;influence.&quot; Rating: A-<BR>7. U R The One: Yet another one of my favorites. A great hook and all around great performances from everyone on this track. Rating: A<BR>8. 6 in the Morning: Awesome track. Some good Eminem moments in this one. Rating: A-<BR>9. How Come: Dare I say, another - one of my favorites. (Damn, I'm beginning to see a pattern). A serious song about Royce. Some emotional stuff in there and sweet lyrics. Rating: A<BR>10. Leave Dat Boy Alone: Well, here we get to a crossroads. I love the beat in this song and I love the verses, but I'm not crazy about the, umm, &quot;Southern&quot; influenced chorus. Rating: B+<BR>11. Get My Gun: Oh Boy, yet another great track. Very funny and a slamming beat. (kind of in the vein of &quot;Business&quot; off of &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;) Rating: A<BR>12. Bizarre: Skit. Kinda funny. Rating: N/A<BR>13. B****: Great track. Some more crazy lyrics from Eminem. Continuing to prove that he's the best in the game right now. (Tupac R.I.P.) Rating: A<BR>14. Steve's Coffee House: A Skit. A dumb skit. Rating: N/A<BR>15. D12 World: A great beat and all the members of D12 (minus Em) making an appearance. The chorus is a little iffy though. Rating: B+<BR>16. 40 oz.: A great party track. Drink one down! Rating: A<BR>17. Commercial Break: Kind of a skit but with a verse. Rating: N/A<BR>18. American Psycho II: Awesome track with Cypress Hill. Production by the Dr. Rating: A-<BR>19. Bugz 97: Another skit. Rating: N/A<BR>20. Good Die Young: It's tough to pick a favorite off this record (as you can see, I have many) but this one would be in the top 3 contenders. A great, solid and emotional track about a friend of the crew. Rating: A<BR>21. Keep Talking: A great diss song. Slamming beat and some really funny lyrics. This one has been around mixtapes for a while and it's a quality track. Rating: A<br />Well, in summary, this album is awesome. Plain and simple. If you're a fan of Em or D12 - chances are - you'll love this CD as much as I do. In comparison to &quot;Devil's Night&quot; - I would say it's a close call, but I might like this one better. <br />Overall Rating: A
B00005JLKB|4.0|No one thought it would work; the concept of Dawson's Creek crosses X-Files crosses Buffy crosses the Superman mythos seemed like typical &quot;inspiration&quot; from the suits at WB. Did TV really need to butcher another famous superhero icon? Fortunately for the viewers and everyone involved, Smallville got the formula right. Appealing to both casual and hardcore Superman fans, the series fleshes out the critical years of Clark Kent's early life. It puts a human face on a hero that has, more often than not, been treated as  an icon and not a character.<br />Smallville rewrites the Superman mythology in several places, most notably by having Clark befriend a young Lex Luthor (note: this actually happened in the old comics, but was wiped out of continuity later on). These alterations work, and a large amount of the credit goes to the actors. Michael Rosenbaum *is* Lex Luthor, and Tom Welling is an equally-impressive Clark Kent. Rounding out the top-notch cast are Kristen Kreuk as Lana Lang, Annette O'Toole as Martha Kent, and Jonathan Schneider as Jonathan Kent. Special mention to Eric Johnson, playing the thankless role of Lana's jock boyfriend.<br />Season 1 of Smallville could be considered pretty routine; major plot points are sprinkled here and there throughtout the season while Clark battles &quot;freak of the weeks&quot; who have been transformed by kryptonite. However, the cast has great chemistry, the effects are top notch, and even the most cliched of episodes become a guilty pleasure. The first few episodes are generally weak, but the latter half of the season and the cliffhanger finale demonstrate what Smallville is capable of.<br />WB has done a decent job of releasing season 1. Decent in that audio/video is above average, but the extras are too few. WB basically got lazy and copied the extras over from the Canadian-only single-disc release of Smallville. Great if you've never seen these extras before, but so much more could've been added (disc 6 only houses 1 episode, leaving tons of unused space). Still, for a quality series like Smallville, extras are just icing on the cake. If you have any interest in Superman or have a soft-spot for teenage drama/action shows, I highly recommend Smallville.houses 1 episode, leaving tons of unused space).

B000148KK2|5.0|After reading a review in \\"Jazz Times\\" and knowing that Elvis Costello was a part of this album, I thought that \\"The girl in the other room\\" would be a new journey for all of the fans of Diana's and the opinions would split. No surprise here...<BR>Great album, might be her greatest. The singing is sexy and sophisticated, the piano sounds superbly, the musicians are great and the songs, perhaps, reveal many recent changes in her life.<BR>OK, all you big time critics of this album, suggest to me what other jazz singer could sing Joni Mitchell and Tom Waits as personal as Diana Krall did? And when we loved all her previous albums full of standards, many of as wondered if Diana ever going to have own originals, and showcase herself as a talented songwriter.<BR>Oh, yes. She may, at some point do a Jobim, Bessy Smith,Sinatra, or, maybe, even Cher songbook and will do it beautifully. But now I welcome \\"The girl in the other room\\" with open ears. Gorgeous music. Ray Brown, Jimmy Rowles and Rosemary Clooney would have been proud of this album.
B000148KK2|5.0|It is about time that Diana wrote and sang her own material. This album that parallels with Diana's personal ups and downs proves that she can break away with the classic American Songbook. The album is wonderfully showcased and performed by Diana with virtuoso piano playing. I am so glad that the album's music is stringless that she has gone back to its roots of DK's quartet. All original six songs that she co-wrote with Costello are exceptionally done and arranged. The other interpreted six songs are also great. More power to Diana ! I love this album !!
B00008S2VG|5.0|For me this is simply her magic record...<BR>I believe it helped me to change my life in so many ways...<BR>Songs like American Life and Hollywood made me think more about the world we live in right now...<BR>Songs like easy Ride and Nobody Knows Me made me reflect about my relationship with other people...<BR>And Nothing Fails and Intervention represent for me my love for my boyfriend...<BR>I really love this album.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is an obvious essential.  If you don't own it... there's someone you know that does.  The &quot;Music Fan&quot; that claims they are only popular because Kurt killed himself... one of the guys from Milli Vanilli killed himself... did everyone rush out and buy THEIR CD's?  No.<br />Nevermind sold because it was good.  It was radio friendly, but very, very good anyway.
B000002HB4|4.0|This is a good compliation of the Satellites. But where you need to start is with &quot;In The Land of Salvation and Sin&quot; record and go from there. That is an all time classic of rock and roll. This has tastes from that record, but you need more than an appetizer!
B00004RFFS|5.0|A Great movie with good performances and a greate story
B00000HZFH|5.0|Major label status has improved BTS. Their indy work, to me, was a bit spotty and at times indulgent. Now the guitar majesty of Doug Martsch is focused, and the songwriting improved. A fine addition to anyone's catalog!
0618526412|5.0|McCullers has an insight into person psychology that allows her to create great characters that everyone can relate to. This is my third time reading this book. It is a great piece of work, and beautifully written. It is a superb memoir, and the author's style is impressive.  The characters are as rich as any who have ever been imagined, and the story is just breathtaking. Highly recommended.
B000002NC4|5.0|Fans of the guitar, this is an album for you. BTS has improved over the years and found their niche, and this is a classic. It makes you want to reach for an air insturment and flail along. Sure, the voice gets some getting used to - but that shouldn't distract one from the majesty of the record!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park once again earns a spot on my frequently-played CD list.<BR>This CD has its share of awesome songs, good songs, and the few awful songs. Almost all of the lyrics are well thought-out and deap, but the song pattern (verse, chorus, verse, chorus, end sorta thing) gets fairly repetitive after a bit. I'm also not very fond of Chester's constant screaming, but it my other musical choices may have an effect on that opinion. Nevertheless, the tunes are memorable and the lyrics hit deep.<br />On the songs themselves...<br />1. Foreword-- Best. Song. Ever. A++++. 100/10. Seriously though, this is alright for thirteen seconds. Frankly, I think it should have just been made the beginning of Don't Stay. No score.<br />2. Don't Stay-- A rather well-balanced song about (at least, how I see it) ending a relationship. It's got a pretty catchy tune, and I often find myself humming it through the day. 4/5<br />3. Somewhere I Belong-- I'm not much of a fan for the alternating between rap and singing as illustrated in this song. The chorus is somewhat memorable. 3/5<br />4. Lying From You-- Okay, Hypocrite Man strikes again. Forget what I said about the alternating rapping/singing techniques: it seems to work here. The random brake screeches seem rather out of place, though, and the shift halfway through to a different key is a bit unsettling. 4/5<br />5. Hit The Floor-- Probably my least favorite song on the album. It might have to do with the extremely constant screaming and near-tuneless rapping. Maybe Linkin Park's not the best band for me, but this song really irks me. 2/5, if not less.<br />6. Easier To Run-- A song that strikes a chord in me. Its lyrics are pretty easily connected to. There's a nice singing-screaming ratio (okay, so there's no screaming). One of my favorite Linkin Park songs. 5/5<br />7. Faint-- Another favorite song. It's got a pretty memorable theme about being ignored-- something that seems to happen to me a lot. The singing is pretty tuneful fora Linkin Park song. Good in my book. 5/5<br />8. Figure.09-- What the heck is the title of this song about? I mean, it's cool and all, but it doesn't seem to have any meaning past that. The song itself is somewhat the same. It's got a cool beat, and I guess I can figure out what this song's about, but it's a little repetitive. Oh well. 4/5<br />9. Breaking The Habit-- It's different. It's calm. It's freaking me out-- this is the same Linkin Park that shouted to me about paranoia? Doesn't bug me. Very (dare I say it?) funky. 5/5<br />10. From the Inside-- Another slightly calmer song. The chorus has some redeeming value, but the rap is a little too repeated for me. 4/5<br />11. Nobody's Listening-- A song with a very Oriental back tune mixed with very American rap. It's okay, I suppose. It just doesn't seem like Linkin Park, but then again, who am I to judge? Dunno what other excuses I have-- I just don't really like this song. Nevertheless, it's alright. 3/5<br />12. Session-- It's nonlyrical. What can I say? Pretty cool beats. 5/5<br />13. Numb-- Certainly the best song on the album. Has such a great theme, and is presented with an extremely catchy tune. Nine of the ten songs I'm humming at school will be this. It's deep, catchy, and tuneful. And no screaming. What more could I want? Totally deserves the five. 5/5<br />All in all, it's a pretty good album, if you're into this type of music. If you're not, then simply don't buy it. I reccomend &quot;Numb&quot; though. Really seriously. It's good.
B000001ESN|5.0|Permanent Waves is easily one the best albums in the world, and possible Rush'e best after Vapout Trails, Fly By Night and Retospective Volume 1.  From the thought provoking lyrics of Spirit of radio, which show just how they got their other name of 'The Thinking Man's Band' to the magnificent Bass solo in Freewill, this is a must for any fan of proper music.
B000148KK2|1.0|I have been a Diana Krall fan since before she was cool.  I Have every one of her CDs., DVDs.  I have several CDs sitting atop my CD Player for frequent play - most of Krall's other works, Ella Fitzgerald, Dave Brubeck, Miles, Norman Brown, Coltrane, Stacey Kent.  But this one will go into the CD binder, and, unfortunately, probably won't come back out. There's not much here.  No groove, no swing, no moving ballads. She left her chops at home on this one.  Disappointed to be sure.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|Someone was asking the name of the track that plays while Bud and Bill are talking outside of Bud's trailer.  I don't know the name of that track but it comes from the movie The Strange Vices of Signora Wardh starring Edwidge Fenech.  Not sure who composed it but it sounds like Bruno Nicolai.  Great movie.  Check it out if you can find it.
0739313126|5.0|THis is a very good audiobook--i listen to it as i do things around my home. however, it has become so interesting as it progresses, that if i am in another room, i have my ear plugged very tightly to the sound and if something happens, i have to run back in to hear it--doesn't help when trying to get housework done! but who cares! i love the french accents and language--i love the ideas about some of the real truths about the catholic church and da vinci's ability to see that and have what seems to be a strong sense of self so that he allows himself to be a prankster and does not allow the church to oppress him as he SEEMINGLY does not in the book. growing up catholic, it is refreshing to see hear this. Plus i love when people stick their neck out not just for the sake of it, but  because they see the truth in things, are brave and speak out when others won't. and, they may do it ALONE! i love hearing the history, the art information, the religious information--knowledge is freedom--this book has freed me in many ways--not because i buy 100% that everything written in this book is FACT, but because it gives me the framework to realize that many fears, suspicions and beliefs that i hold right now about people, ideas, things,etc., are simply cobwebs and i can clean them out right now...
B00018D44U|4.0|I enjoy this CD.  I can also understand how someone could turn away from it fast.  I am a Marine and it is not too popular with most of the guys in the barracks.  With that said, her jazzy/country voice is one that can really relax me.  I believe that this young lady has a bright future ahead of her.  This album is just a start.  When she experiences a little more life, the songs will improve.
1577311760|5.0|i have a resistance to writing anything about this book--because i can't do justice to it in writing nor can i give eckhart tolle what he deserves by this message. just read it or listen to the qudiobook--in fact i recommend listening to the audiobook--that is what i did, in my car, everywhere i went--it is his voice that plays and i was so soothed and, again, i can't describe it-wonderful... i do want to say this-- i tend toward drama so if you listen and are disappointed, maybe it is just not your thing---but to me this is not about being someone's &quot;thing&quot; or not because it has transformed me inside...and continues to do so
B0000057C5|4.0|This album is my favorite Rammstein so far. People who say their guitar riffs are kind of bland and monotonous or that they lack talent, are mistaken. Listen to &quot;Bestrafe Mich&quot; or &quot;Du Hast&quot; with an open mind and it's clear to see they're very talented. Also there's a very catchy melodic ballad on here which proves they have range. This is industrial rock with a tiny bit of dance beat thrown in. I love the dry metallic guitar sound and the singer's deep singing voice.<br />David Rehak<br />author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|A man tells his stories often enough, he becomes his stories and his stories live on after him. In that way he becomes immortal. Big Fish is a story about storytelling, about embracing the magic of existence, and the art of telling tall tales, even if they are true. This is a wonderful movie and it's life filled to overflowing with more life than life itself. I loved every minute of it.  I watched this movie because it was Directed by Tim Burton, I had no idea what it was about, but I heard it was very good.  The first part of this movie was a fun heartwarming set of tall tales, intertwined with a son angry at his father for allways telling them and never letting him know the real truth. I thought it was a good movie 4 out of 5 stars or so. Then the ending.  I wasn't ready for the movie to end, but I have to say this is the best ending I've ever seen in a movie. The way in which the story brings the son around and shows us why and how his father's stories work is fantastic. I'm watching as circus freaks are waving at an old man and I'm tearing up. Only Tim Burton could cause me those emotions at those images. 5 stars.
B000002MG1|5.0|My favorite tracks here are Drive, Man on the Moon, and Nightswimming. But there are others worth noting. All are memorable easy-listening tunes for those more soothing moments.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I liked this movie alot, and would have given it five stars, but for the inacurate portrayal of Marine Iguanas on the Galapagos Islands.  Read the other reviews for information on the acting and action, I am writing to stand up for the lowly Iguana.<br />Just about every rocky shoreline in the Galapagos Islands is home to the marine iguana, the only sea-going lizard in the world. The marine iguana is an extraordinary animal which lives on land but grazes on a variety of seaweed, either on exposed rocks or by diving into the cold seawater. This habit, totally unique in iguanas, provides them with an abundant food source but can make them vulnerable to predation by sharks and other large fish. <br />In the movie, there are scenes reminiscent of Darwin's \\"Voyage of the Beagle\\", many of the characters are seen collecting what are supposed to be marine iguanas.  However, are these actual Galapagos marine iguanas?  No.  These are actually the common Green Iguanas of South America.  They are not even using costumes or makeup, just their natural green skin.  It is like they are acting on the stage.  Do these iguanas get credit at the end of the movie?  No!  Like Kermit the frog said, Its not easy being green.  Real marine iguanas are ugly dark colored brutes you would never want to meet in a dark alley, but common green iguanas are our friends.  <br />This was a great movie, it just doesn't give proper credit to the iguanas.
B000002LFU|4.0|The lyrics on this album are pretty dumb hahaha, but the songs are upbeat and soooo catchy. People make fun of me for liking this album, but I don't care, I love that song &quot;Stand&quot;, I could listen to it over and over. Other very catchy tunes here too. This is the CD you take with you to the beach, the songs are very beach-y.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Perhaps the most common misconception about this film is that it is a western.  It's not and those who criticize its \\"flower power\\" music or non-western sentiments don't understand what this film is really trying to say.<BR>It's actually, more of an anti-western.  First of all, it takes place at the turn of the twentieth century.  The old west is dead but our two anti-heroes (Butch and Sundance) haven't figured this out.  The movie is full of symbolism indicating the changing times (the bicycle, for example).  Butch even muses about adapting to the new era when he briefly talks about the two of them enlisting in the army, actually getting real jobs, and buying a ranch.  But he always goes back to his old way of thinking in the end.  This is shown symbolically when Butch tosses the bicycle aside.  Because of this, he is doomed to die like the old west.  Butch and Sundance are in pursuit of the old west at the same time the new era is chasing them (in the form of faceless lawmen always at a distance).  They finally end up in Bolivia, a backwards land that seems to suit them.  But even there, their fate eventually catches up with them.
0425173755|2.0|Murder On the Orient Express was a story about a detective by the name of Hercule Poirot.  While he was on a train going to London, a murder occurred, and he was asked to step in to try to solve it.  With every person on the train a suspect, you'll never believe the twisted ending.<BR> My opinion of the book was that I didn't like it very much.  The plot was simple, but it got confusing for me with all the different characters that were involved.  It was difficult for me to understand, and keep everything straight.  I most certainly didn't enjoy it.  I would not recommend this book, unless you want to be bored to death.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|I have a question. Why are there so many people reviewing this album that don't even like D12 in the first place? I mean of course ur gonna give it a 1 star so you got no place reviewing it cuz more than likely you have never even heard it. Oh and to A Music Fan, you probly just looked up some classic rap albums to list in your review. I bet you couldn't name one song off of straight outta compton, and by the way Eazy E's solo career sucked. And to whoever that guy was that dissed the Beastie Boys I got a finger for you as well, by the way look for the new Beasties album this June. Anyways back to the album, I think it was a great cd. I wasn't impressed by every song but it was a huge improvment from Devils Night. Once again they've decided to use their worst song and the first single but once I got the album I was shocked. Git Up, U R the one, How Come, Get My Gun, American Psycho 2, the Bugz freestyle, and Good Die Young were the best ones. Bizarre actually bust some impressive line whereas in Devils Night he was funny but no more than annoying skill wise. Ever time Eminem releases a solo album I have yet to be impressed, accept for his underground album infinite, if you can get that it is awesome. But when he raps with his group the really talented Mc comes out in him. I also hope this album will give the other five members the credit they deserve, Proofs solo album searchin 4 Jerry Garcia should come out this year so look out for that. Peace!
B0001Z53CY|5.0|D12 has come a long way since thier 2001 release Devils Knight. D12 World is unique because the group flows so much better on this album.  Eminem probably saved his best lyrics for his 4th solo LP released titled Don't Call Me Marshall out in December. Skits suck on this album. <br />1. Git Up... Great Intro!<BR>2. Loyalty... Filler with Obie Trice<BR>3. I'll Be Damned... OK song<BR>5. My Band...Typical Eminem Lead Single  <BR>6. U R The 1... Slow song <BR>7. 6 In Tha Morning... CD starts to pick up, good song<BR>8.

B00004XOWM|1.0|Why y'all hatin? Just take it eaze an' listen 2 diz album. Freddy-D is a genius, he drops dem wicked rhymes just like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer before him. Whats more, he keeps one foot firmly planted in Backstreet Boy territory with his emotional falsetto. And whats all this talk about the f-bomb? The Bizkit Crew is just trying to keep it real. I don't know what you are all talking about, Limp Bizkit is the shiznack and have loads of street cred. If you want some mad rhymes and some good cruising tuneskis, then pick this album up. If you want to be enlightened and empowered then buy it. Limp Bizkit is still relevant in today's modern social landscape. People like Fred Durst, Vanilla ICE, MC Hammer and the Backstreet Boys will always be number one and will never die like other poser bands.
B000069HK2|5.0|From the poetic flow of &quot;Blue and Yellow&quot; to the heavy punk/emo &quot;A Box Full Of Sharp Objects&quot; This Cd has so much to offer to such a wide variety of listeners.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore has had an incredible accomplishment with his 'Rings' scores. All three are full of beautiful and original music. One of the best things is that the soundtracks each contain many different emotions. 'The Return of the King' starts out with the sweet sounds of 'A Storm is Coming.' 'The White Tree' is a very powerful track, while 'Shelob's Lair' and 'Minas Morgul' are terrifying.'The Black Gate Opens' will bring tears to your face with its beautiful flutes. Listening to this CD, you are reminded of the emotions of the movie. All three scores are amazing, and have received Oscars, Grammys, and Golden Globes well deserved!
0807219533|5.0|I got this audio on a whim and didn't know what to expect.  What a lucky break for me!  This book is fantastic.  It's definitely dark, with dark motivations (revenge, humiliation, lack of love) for a young boy.  Nevertheless, you can't help but root for this poor, brilliant boy.  The genie is wonderfully witty, and the chapters told from his point of view are some of the best and most original.  I hurried to get the next book in the trilogy and was bitterly disappointed to learn the next audio is not due out until August.<br />The person who reads this book on audio is perfect, and adds to the experience.<br />I'm an adult, but I want my 10 year old to listen to the Amulet of Samarkand as well.  It's appropriate and entertaining for all ages.
0385512104|5.0|This is a wonderfully perceptive look at the world through the child of autism. Though this is a short book, it is easy to read and can be read in one night (Which I did). Very hard to put down until it is finished. So many things I didn't understand about this illness that are brought to light through this book.<BR> &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; is a poignant and well written book of lessons learned with emotions that run the gambet from sadness to laughter.
0553382179|3.0|There is a lot of great advice in this book. The clutter clearing tips alone make this a great addition to your library of housecleaning books. I also love the advice that even housecleaning done incorrectly still blesses the family, because I know that sometimes we can get hung up on the notion of doing things right or not doing them at all.<br />However, you will have to tailor the system to suit your family and your needs. For example, we just have two people in our house, it is very easy to keep our home clean with just some simple pick up and staying on top of laundy. The rountines suggested actually make it harder for me. For people with children, or with health problems, you may also have a hard time doing everything &quot;by the book&quot;. Marla does encourage you to set it up the way that works for you though, which I appreciate.<br />There is one point that really bothered me in this book. Most women who will read this book, may have a husband who does absolutly nothing around the house. She basically says to get over it, and just do it yourself. She makes it a point that if you were living alone you would have to do all the chores yourself, so you may as well do them now without complaint. That'd be great if you were still living alone, but in a household with two adults, it seems fair that the wife has a little help, especially if both spouses work outside the home. I don't think it is too much to ask that a husband, or wife, pick up after themselves.<br />Overall it is a good book for getting ideas of how to improve your household by implementing the use of routines. There are also good cleaning tips, and her writing style is easy to read. Just be sure that you don't drive yourself crazy trying to do everything she tells you! Take the good, and what works, and leave the rest behind.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I sure don't know what to say but I truly believe American Life will become a classic 20, 30 years down the road because the album had so many mixed reviews by so many different people all around the world.  Like all of Madonna's albums they all always have mixed reviews but nothing like American Life at a time when we're at war and at a time when Madonna has grown up, she's become more and more smarter, more beautiful and most of all more spiritual.... and I think all of that shows up on this album.  Honestly I do love this album like all the rest of her other albums, this album is different and intersting at the same time.  I have to say when I first heard &quot;American Life&quot; I wasn't all that thrilled with it and didn't see it becoming a popular song either.  After hearing it so many times I kind of grew to like it and don't think it's so bad of a song just different compared to anything she's ever done before.  I also think Madonna knew she was taking a chance with this song as well as the rest of the album but really I don't think she was more interested in being #1 but more interested in doing what she felt was being true to herself as an artist and sharing that part with her fans or audience.  I think thats why Madonna has remained the Queen of ROCK or POP because she is true to what she believes and thats what makes her so unique and special in a lot of ways.  People see that about Madonna even the ones who hate her at the same time admire her for her neverending energy to keep going and keep believing in herself. If anyone who reads this and understand what I'm talking about I say go out and buy the album and give it a chance you be surprise or you may not be surprise but if you listen to it a few times you'll really say to yourself &quot;this really is a good album, not the best but definitely worth listening to and the music just feels good too&quot; Madonna will always be the QUEEN of ALL DIVAS..... :-)
0345452577|3.0|This is the first J. Kellerman book I've read. Other reviews will inform you better about the plot itself. My small contribution will focus on the story's degree of suspense.  The entire work is only 375 pages. I found that it was not very gripping at all until around page 200. Therefore, I'd rate pages 1-200 with just ONE STAR but pages 200-375 with FOUR STARS. The first 200 pages for me were too full of medical jargon and mundane details of characters lives that failed to interest me. I'm glad I read on. I'd recommend, however, that you either borrow a copy or wait for the paperback! It's the book equivalent of a wait-for-the-video flick in the theaters!
B000005JA8|5.0|I can't understand the reactions of the folk here on amazon. That's what happens if you expose the peak of popular music avant-garde to folk who are used to listening Led Zeppelin at best[or is it pop they are in to?].<BR>I find this cd inspiring, the music AND the lyrics, not to mention the album cover.<BR>This is a daring and intelligent masterpiece of the 60s counterculture, one that is unparralled even today[I sort of don't take punk's more pretentious veins, such as Devo and Pere Ubu to be as credible], and that should serve as a model for modern artists everywhere, being a total masterpiece of music, poetry and visual art.<BR>Buy it, worship it, but don't throw it away. Give it to an open-minded friend, if you have any, that is.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Realistically, there is really no need for any sort of review on these films. The Star Wars franchise has long since crossed the line seperating \\"movies\\" from \\"cultural phenomena.\\" Basically, if you are not at least passingly familiar with these films, then you probably are so completely out of touch with mainstream society that you don't own a computer, and are thus incapable of even reading this in the first place.<BR>That being said, I'll throw in my two cents, on the off chance that they'll actually matter to anyone.<BR>First of all, I am absolutely euphoric regarding the long-anticipated DVD release of the trilogy. Having one of history's most influencial and beloved films on a technologically superior (and more durable) format is simply wonderful. I don't particularly mind the delay - I concede that Lucasfilm probably wanted to make sure that the DVD format would \\"stick\\" in the popular market (especially after getting burned with the old Laserdisc release of the trilogy), and I for one am happy that they took their time to make sure that the DVD release was executed well. A number of films suffered (and many more were simply not helped in any way) from DVD conversion in the initial spate of DVD releases, and I personally would hate to see the same happen to some of my favortie movies of all time. And I remain optimistc that this delay time is being well-spent; I expect the Star Wars DVDs to be similar in quality and format to the recently-released Indiana Jones boxed set (i.e., the highest qulaity in an effective format). Besides, we all thought that we were going to have to wait until the conclusion of the prequel trilogy before we got the originals on DVD.<BR>As for the inclusion of the Special Editions rather than the original releases, I can't really complain there either. George Lucas considers the SE's to be the definitive versions of the films now. Who am I to second-guess what Mr. Lucas does with his own work? For better or for worse, the public is coming to regard the SE relaeses as the definitive versions of the film as well - to the point that people attribute additions to the Special Editions to original material that was removed (a la Luke's screaming in the Cloud City core - a sound effect only found in the Special Edition). Besides, what can visual effects, a sound effect here and there, and Greedo shooting first take away from the movies as a whole? All of the concepts, stories, settings, and characters that made us fall in love with these movies in the first place are all still there, and that's what really matters.<BR>So, if you'd rather shroud yourself in the nostalgia of bygone days, just sit in your room with the shades drawn, watching your copies of the orginal releases on VHS, Betamax, Laserdisc, whatever until they wear out. The rest of us will be watching the SAME MOVIES (with some MINOR amendments) in a better-supported and higher-quality format. Everyone's happy.
B00018D44U|5.0|&quot;Come away with Me&quot; was a great cd! I loved it so much. I wondered how Norah would come up with a follow up that was as good as the first. But I didn't need to worry b-cuz this album was great! Her voice is so relaxing, so after a hard day you can grab a cup of hot tea and read a good book while listening to her CD. You need to buy it! You'll regret it if you don't!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I am an avid fan of Tim Burton.  This is my favorite Burton film.  I have a feeling that this is the style that he will continue with for years.  I also think that Tim Burton will be one of the more common directors in the not so distant future.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have watched the series again on video and it is classic. It may be just as good as Saving Private Ryan for the sheer length and the stories. There is great attention to details that makes watching the series over and over again so enjoyable. I recommend it to everyone.
B0001Z53CY|3.0|With such a great debut album as D12 had with Devil's Night you almost had a feeling that the sophmore LP couldn't stand up to its predecessor. Although its not as good from track one to the end as Devil's Night, D12 World is not a bad album by any means. Very few songs disappointed me. But I mean c'mon with a 3 year wait between albums, there definately should be no songs that lack. The beats are not nearly as good as Devil's Night, but that don't mean they're bad neither.Almost all the hooks are annoying. Compared to the \\"rap\\" that's on the radio this is leagues above it. Best songs on this album are loyalty, 6 in the morning, how come, leave dat boy alone(which i seem to be the only person who likes this song), american psycho(personal favorite), and good die young. Someone earlier claimed that the Bugz 97 verse was a freestyle, not quite. It was his verse from a D-12 song Desperados not a freestyle. Although not quite a classic, still worth my $10.
B000002JPA|3.0|This is definately not Dream Theaters best album. I'm tired of hearing people say they dont like dream theater because someone suggested I&amp;W as their best album. Dont get me wrong this is a decent album,take the time i like cuz it has some catchy riffs and Metropolis 1 is one of the greatest songs thy're ever made. <br />If you want to hear a good DT album get any of their latest 4 (i'm still not totally familiar with a change of seasons and have heard 2 songs from awake)<br />To put it blunt,if you're new to DT this isn't for you (nor is their lengthy more complex stuff,it usually takes people awhile to get used to it),none the less a good album,but still a little too early 90s for me (especially Another Day).
B00006FDCD|2.0|I just finished watching this on cable and, wow, was it mediocre.  I made the same mistake another reviewer made and read the book first.  While long, the book goes into much more detail which made for a far better story.  Although it's tough to bring a long book to the screen, the movie was very corny, especially the ending.  Again, wow!  What was that?!  I can't say that it was terrible and parts were kinda fun to watch but I definitely would not recommend someone actually buying this.  Watch it on cable if it's on but save your money for the far better scary movies available..

0679879269|5.0|This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. In some magical way, this is a book that, through the stories of several very original characters is able to address God, love, maturity, humanity's history and meaning, and countless other wonderful topics. This was more than just a novel to me; it has shaped my philosophy and way of looking at the world. Thos who say that this is a children's book a la \\"Harry Potter\\" are wrong. Maybe to the young readers, that's how it is, but I'm 14 and I was able to see that this is more than an easy, pleasurable fantasy like Harry Potter. This is a novel but also a manuscript of Pullman's philosophies and views. It is an extraordinary book that operates on a truly incredible, epic scale. From the first book, things just built up and built up, and here it all comes together in a brilliant, and very sad, climax. Read the series. You'll be enlightened.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I was very disappointed with this movie!  It had great potential with an outstanding all-star ensemble cast.  <br />Unfortunately there is an over-abundance of profanity, semi-pornographic nudity, and strong anti-American sentiment!<br />Whoever thinks these sort of things enhance a movie is sadly mistaken.

0156027321|5.0|Initially I was a little skeptical about plot of this book but I decided to give it a try since it receives so many good reviews. Boy, I am thankful that I gave it a chance. &quot;Life of Pi&quot; by Yann Martel deals with Pi, a sixteen years old boy from India who was stranded on a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra (with a broken leg), an orang utan by the name of Orange Juice, a 450 pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The beginning of the book dealt with the early childhood of Pi, the son of a zookeeper and who was a believer in Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. Soon, due to hardship, the family decided to migrate to Canada. On the way to Canada, the ship they were boarding sank, and suddenly Pi found himself thrown into a lifeboat in the middle of nowhere, with all those animals. Soon, Pi realized that the how grave his situation was; he  was lost, and worst still with a 450 pound tiger as his companion. The rest of the book dealt mostly with Pi's situation, how he kept himself alive - both from the lack of food and water, and from Richard Parker. <br />This book is truly amazing. It is eye-opening to see what a boy can do to survive. I have never read anything as clever and mesmerizing as this. This is definitely NOT your typical fiction. The characters are lovable and personalities of the animals (particularly Richard Parker) are just fascinating. There are many hilarious moments in this book. For instance, I love the explanation of how a Bengal tiger was named &quot;Richard Parker&quot; or when Pi's family became aware of Pi's three religions.  I highly recommend this book as it is one of those rare books that you will always remember reading and wish the story never ends.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This film is truly one of the best sci-fi genre movies around.  If you enjoyed the Matrix, Bladerunner, 1984, and Kill Bill this is fresh while still borrowing sensibilities from these films!  Smart and well acted!
078401213X|4.0|Darren Aronofsky was rewarded with a big budget (Requiem for a Dream) after making this incredibly innovative film. &quot;Pi&quot; is short on special effects and explosions - so if that is your sort of movie keep on walking.  BUT if you like a movie about people who THINK, and are sometimes mentally tortured by what they're thinking about, &quot;Pi&quot; is a good way to spend an hour and a half, and a cheap DVD at that.  It's filmed in a grainy kind of black and white, but that just adds to the atmosphere of the gradually deteriorating mental state of Mathematical Genius Sean Gullette.  The important thing to my enjoying this film isn't in questioning &quot;what is this film trying to SAY?&quot; so much to me as just appreciating that it's trying to say anything at all.  Some things that are unknowable should maybe stay that way.
B000089RVX|1.0|I'm not just talking about the band, but anyone who has reviewed this album is a complete arse. You have people who only listen to the top 40, who's reviews go something like: &quot;OH MY GOD, THEY ARE TRUELY THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO PUT BORING GUITAR RIFFS, UNINTELLIGENT LYRICS, A FAKE GOTH IMAGE, AND A RAPPING VERSE IN THE LEAD SINGLE? BRILLIANT!!!!!&quot; And then you have people bashing them because it's &quot;cool&quot; to bash anyone that has sold more than 5 copies of an album, which normally looks like this: &quot;Duh, I don't LiKe thIS Band BEcaUse THEY are PoPuLaR, bands LikE SlIpKnOt and KoRn suCk, Too, DuH, jUst BecAuse.&quot;<br />In my opinion, everyone should go F*CK themselves, get it done and over with, quit all your b*tching, just shut up already.
B0001GL3K4|3.0|I genuinely loved LOVE ACTUALLY when I saw the theatrical version in December.  It helped that I was in London, and I had a great date with me, and it was snowing outside, and there were little twinkling Christmas lights all along the street outside the cinema, and we'd just walked through Notting Hill to get to the theatre . . . so I was really in the mood for this film.<br />Admittedly, this is a great popcorn movie.  Entertaining.  Enjoyable.  Delightful.  It doesn't require a great deal of intellectual  investment, but it probably has one of the greatest casts of English (and American) actors assembled in one film since \\"Gosford Park.\\"  So, it was perfect for a Saturday afternoon.<br />Admittedly, there are a lot of illogical moments.  (For example, one would think that the Prime Minister of England would have easy access to the address -- and last name -- of one of his senior household staff, rather than having to tromp up and down a cold, dark street, knocking on doors looking for her on Christmas Eve.)<br />And although the staggering number of intersecting plotlines could understandably overwhelm, I came away from the movie feeling that Richard Curtis had artfully woven an endearingly warm and fuzzy quilt around us, affirming that, still, \\"love is in the air\\" amidst a very complicated world.<br />In short, not a deep thought-provoking film, but not a bad way to spend a snowy London afternoon cuddled up in the cinema.<br />The feature commentary on the DVD, unfortunately, destroyed a lot of that illusion.<br />Curtis and Hugh Grant were obvious choices as two of the commentary participants.  But given the size and pedigree of this cast, it's surprising that they weren't able to come up with more interesting co-commentators than Bill Nighy and nine-year-old Thomas Sangster.<br />Nighy was wonderful in the film, but his self-deprecating comments in the commentary pretty much destroy the cocky on-screen persona he had so memorably created on screen. <br />As forthe talented young Thomas Sangster, he too was marvelous on screen. But it was inappropriate to have a nine-year-old boy participate in the running commentary of this film.  I am no prude.  The nudity and sexual content of LOVE ACTUALLY did not phase me at all . . . in fact, it was essential to the twisting and intertwining plots which tell such a story of contemporary love in today's society.  But rewatching the entire film while a nine-year-old boy viewed it with three wise-cracking men in their 40's and 50's made even me uncomfortable.  At one point, even Richard Curtis says \\"So Thomas, how does it feel to be watching a movie that, legally, you can't even get in to see.\\"  Perfectly said, and they should have thought better.<br />As for Hugh Grant . . . . I have always really liked his performances, including in this movie.  And living in England half the time as I do, I thoroughly understand that razer-sharp English public school (i.e. private boarding school) banter and humour (which is often at the expense of others.)  But in his commentary, I did not understand Hugh Grant's non-stop trashing of Colin Firth.  The first few remarks were funny. The next six, not quite so.  But two and a half solid hours of continuous bitchy remarks by Mr. Grant about Mr. Firth -- whose performance was one of the most heartfelt in this film -- became really irritating and downright rude. And for me, it really was counter to the warm feelings and hopeful spirit the film claims to trumpet and portray. It was, perhaps, meant as good-spirited fun, but it came off as vicious sniping at a colleague and a fellow actor.<br />Most disappointing, however, was Richard Curtis' commentary itself.  What I previously thought had been a fresh, interesting  , and well-thought-out directorial masterplan was obviously, instead, a shoot-from-the-hip scramble, by his own admission (Well, he's still a great writer.)<br />All-in-all, this particular commentary illustrates that filmmakers and actors should remember that a commentary becomes a viable and permanent part of their film's persona once it is released on DVD, and that they should be thoughtful not to destroy or lessen the illusions and patina they had created in the film itself. It's no joke, even in a lighthearted film.<br />The DVD does showcase a couple of deleted scenes which perhaps  SHOULDN'T have ended up on the cutting room floor -- most notably the hilarious segment where Emma Thompson and her son (a talented young man whom you otherwise barely notice in the final cut) are called to the Head Mistress' office over one of the most innovative Christmas Wish essays ever written.  It is (or would have been) probably the funniest scene in the movie.<br />The movie on DVD is still, of course, the movie, and it's still great fun, and completely enjoyable.  My advice, though, would be to avoid the commentary, and just stick to the deleted scenes.<br />Oh yes, and one last thing . . . this DVD does eloquently allow the viewer to watch, over and over, the subtly nuanced performance of the magnificent Emma Thompson, who I'd say is one of the greatest actors on the planet.  Her anguished, wordless scene, standing next to her stark, coldly-lit, empty marital bed, is one of such moving, gripping emotion that you almost have to avert your eyes, since you feel you are intruding on a moment of such deep, private pain.<br />And you have to give Curtis credit for those moments, as well.<BR>Even wordless scenes are written, and even brilliant actors such as Thompson have to be directed and captured on film.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|everybody is saying how change is great. No its not. Enigma has changed for the worse. This is happening to too many good groups these days. I listen to Enigma because it has such a unique and mysterious sound and now I hear cheesy pop songs. What is up? Enigma always took me to another world, but now, this one takes me to some lame ass highschool party. If you want to change, fine, but you should also change the name of the band. If I wanted to hear cheesy music, then I would listen to cheesy music. I listen to Enigma because of their awsome sound that has now been crapped on. Why change something that is so great? When a band has new album come out, I always hope to hear a very similiar sound, thats why I listen to them. Why would they assume that people want to hear something new and crappy? This also happend to Delerium. But I guess this can be a good thing, It makes me explore other artist to get the sound that I am looking for, but they will probably change to. Hurray for change!! There are a few good songs on here but thats not saying much.
B00005Y228|1.0|I really couldn't understand what all the fuss was about this album, it wasn't spectacular, although its leaps and bounds above anything of what's on her current album. <BR>Like kylie it is medicore and fluffy. If that's the stuff you like, it's right up your street, however for those of that like a bit of substance and some emotion and intelligence expressed in songs you should really try and avoid this.
B00005YJMX|4.0|Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979)<br />Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht directed by Werner Herzog, is really a color remake of the 1922 film Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens directed by F.W. Murnau.  There are a couple of name changes: Count Orlok became Count Dracula; Jonathan's fiancée Nina became Jonathan's wife Lucy.  The original film was silent and in black and white, where the 1979 version is in color and is in German with English subtitles. <br />However the plot is close to Bram Stoker's book on Count Dracula which has a very similar plot line and story.  F.W. Murnau bought the movie rights to the film; however these rights were owned by Bram's widow Florence and she refused to allow the use of the name and storyline.   Even though Murnau had changed the major names of the main characters (Count Dracula, Thomas and his wife Ellen) and location enough similarity remained that Florence took the case to court and in July of 1925 the German court ordered all the copies of the movie destroyed.  However a few copies did manage to survive.<br />While the film starts off slow it shows spectacular scenes of an ocean voyage, and waterfalls experienced during Jonathan (Bruno Ganz) Harker's journey to Count (Klaus Kinski) Dracula's castle. The contrast with his return trip is startling, since he was healthy when he started, but on the return is very sickly and barely alive.   The Count's journey is very stark, his companions' death and rats board another ship, which glides into port with no one left alive on board except the rats.   As the rats depart the ship one reminded of the story of Ben, where the rats were everywhere and out of control.<BR>An interesting dilemma in this film is the direct confrontation of belief in the existence of the supernatural and sacramental with belief in the rationale of science.  Science was believed to able to explain away rationally anything that happened out of the ordinary.   Yet here it could not produce an answer for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) Harker.   The way that this was shown was that after consulting with the town physician, Lucy broke and crumbed the Eucharist around Jonathan to keep him locked into a chair in a corner all night, while she became the sacrificed lamb to save him from the Count and death.    While she did this out of her love for Jonathan, her sacrifice resulted in the final demise of Count Dracula and her own death.   Yet Jonathan in essence lives on to carry the legacy of the living dead, alive yet not fully.   The last that is seen of Jonathan is when he is released from his imposed prison, by the removal of the broken host around him, he declares that he has much work to accomplish he mounts a horse and rides off.
B000068OCS|5.0|This movie is amazing. It's not for everybody or for everyday viewing, but it is truly an experience. In life, there always seem to be those moments when the clouds look just perfect, or the sky, the horizon, the mountains, something around you looks more alive then you've ever noticed before. Even though, at that moment, you fumble around with you camera trying to save the beauty you see for posterity; the pictures never come out looking like you remembered. Somehow, this film managed to catch all of those moments and I am forever grateful.
B000007T1M|1.0|How could people even call this band the best of all time, this is just another reason the music industry is pathetic, this isn't even &quot;metal&quot; it's pure political pop crap, and yes system of a down is as pop as feminem, stupid whiny songs, typicially<BR>boring power chords, and the same old crap, this and the whole nu metal rap metal needs to go away and it should soon<BR>If you want a better look at this subject<BR>Listen to anthrax/Public Enemy<BR>F*** Nu Metal
B0001Z53CY|5.0|Face it, rap's in a hole, at least Em and D-12 are climbing out of it.
B0001Z53C4|1.0|Once again eminem indulges his gift by using controversy to sell records, the result a preverse mess, and this time with his dreadful group every song is awful, the beats are nonexistent and the writing is toruture, this is just another example of a bad industry we live in once again,<BR>and this cd is for the coaters.
B0001HAISG|5.0|The DVD is great. I received it as a present from an aunt of mine, and I'm happy I've finally got my hands on the Peter Pan dvd. The movie is full of magic, adventure, romance, and sword fights! This will appeal to the adults as well. I didnt expect much when this movie came out, but when I saw it on the theatres, I was blown away. =D Don't miss out.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I love it when a band breaks up and fans of the old group get to benift from it.  Let me explain, I am a huge fan of At the Drive In.  Of course I was devistated when the band broke up (especially since I had a ticket to go see them opening for the Beastie Boy [not there fault, that was when one of the B-boys fell of his bike and busted his arm]).  I'm not sure if this ablum would have ever been made if ATDI didn't break up but, if there is a chance that it wouldn't have then I'm glad they did.  This cd consists of some great vocals, fantastic guitar melodys, and drumming that is jaw dropping.  If you play the drums or have an appreiciation for excelent drum playing, then you will enjoy this album based on that alone.  Don't go wankin off, get this.
B000002AVF|5.0|Congratulations! That's the only thing that can be said to Mariah on this, her sixth album. An absolute delight of intoxicating, un-forgettable songs and catchy lyrics, Mariah has once again excelled herself. 'Fantasy', probably one of the greatest up-tempo songs of all time, begins our amazing journey through this incredible album. A ridiculously catchy song, it fills your mind and intoxicates your senses. A real modern day triumph, and the rest of the album follows suit. 'Underneath The Stars', a simple yet beautiful (yet unconventional) ballad, moves us on. Other highlights include 'Always Be My Baby', 'I Am Free', 'Melt Away' and 'Forever'. This album has so much to offer real music fans world-wide, while staying true to Mariah's fans as she stays with what she does best; make incredible music. Not much more can be said; Absolutely Fantastic, A Real Triumph! Well Done Mariah, you are the BEST!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|It's unfortunate that so many people would write decent reviews about this ablum.  This piece will ruin your life if you listen to it, that's how bad it is.  I bought this on a &quot;new music cd shopping spree.&quot;  Quick to jump on bandwagons, I bought this after hearing the song on the iPod commercial.  After listening to the cd a few times, I almost lost my will to live.  I'm forming a law suite against this band for almost stealing my soul.  that's how much they suck.
B000002A46|5.0|This is truly a work of art. A stunning collection of songs from a now established miracle-worker. Mariah really excells herself here. 'All I Want For Christmas Is You', her self-penned Christmas bonanza is a delightful and festive song of jovial holiday bliss. The songs here are extremely passionately and well sung, and with a most spine-tingling tenderness. 'Silent Night' and 'Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) are examples of this. But where Mariah truly shines brighter than any other star out there is on 'O Holy Night'. The depth of feeling coupled with her incredible vocal talent truly leave you with a deep spiritual feel of Christmas, and it is quite breath-taking. A beautiful collection, and a modern day classic
055321277X|4.0|This book was a fairly easy book to read, once yo get started, due to no hard words or complex situations.  It was also extremely short, under a hundred pages.  Although it was short, there were a few times I got lost or a little confused.  For example, Dr. Lanyon had died, but later in the story there is a letter form him.  Also the same situation with Dr. Jekyll.  The beginning was a little difficult to get started.  It contained too many adjectives and was too wordy.<BR>   This science fiction would have been more intriguing if I didn't  already know the plot of the story.  There are many differences between the book and all the other stories  I have heard, which I did not like.  It also contained good parts.  The book eventually starts piecing itself together and gets more enjoyable.  This book would be good for a those who like science fiction and seeing all sides of the story
B0000AQVCL|5.0|They are better then great. i mean i am the first to admit that i am not crazy about englands bands but they are great. Especially there song look what you have done.<br />this is great!<br />It is worth all the money. I mean come on some people aren't the biggest fans of liket he beastie boys and stuff but they are better then that. They have the talent for great!They can be just as successful as the beatles and maybe better. i give them 5 stars.
0451528956|3.0|The novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was not that intersting to me. It however was great in making you think of how often a person lets their emotions get the better of them. If a person wants to read a book that gives insite of the strugle one person went through with their good and evil side then this is the book to read. However if you want a book that flows great and can be understood at first glance than you might want to think twice about this book. I recomend this book only because it is so widely known and it gives a good account of  ones stugle between a person they should be and the person the would like to be.
B0001CCXY8|1.0|The Lord is My Shepard. I shall not want<br />He maketh me lie down in green pastures, He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restores my soul.<br />He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.<br />Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me, your rod and your staff they comfort me.<br />Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You have anointed my head with oil. My cup runneth over.<br />Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all of the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of The Lord forever.<br />Psalm 23.<br />Groups such as this are a waste. Sad thing is, they are too engrossed in their own wretchedness to see that the things that they glorify are what stand awaiting them at their own deaths. May God have mercy on their souls, because you can rest assured, Satan certainly won't.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I'm not quite sure how diehard Tim Burton fans will take to this movie.  For one thing, it is Tim stab at making a sentimental movie.  Now, so far, Tim's stock-and-trade has been irony.  That his not to say that his films are not life-affirming - paradoxically, Beetlejuice is tremendously life-affirming.  However, this movie aims for the heart and does it without any trace of cynicism.  <br />The salvation of the movie comes from the imagination of the stories Bloom tells and Burton's visual sensibility.  This is Burton's best movie in years.  (Planet of the Apes was AWFUL.)  As we watch the always-engaging Ewan McGregor get into one unbelievable adventure after another, we can't help but be amused.  This is not a movie with a beginning or an end - just a whole lot of middle.<br />Once again, it's not quite Edward Scissorhands, but it deserves much more attention than it got when it was originally in theaters.

B000089RVX|5.0|So many of the negative reviews for Evanescence - Fallen seem to be from the same type of person: The Rock Snob. <br />I've been involved with music for nearly 20 years, much of it spent playing metal. The rock snob has always been there trying to tell everyone else what's good and what sucks. Here they offer up Nightwish to counter Evanescence. Well, Nightwish is great if you like to hear King Diamond's grandmother singing metal. The rock snob is an insecure person who thinks that music is some sort of competition. It's not.<br />What Evanescence brings is well produced listenable hard rock with a darkness to it. What's wrong with that? The songs are great. The musicians are great, especially the vocals. People like it. Fallen is an exceptional record!<br />A great jazz musician once said &quot;If it sounds good, it IS good!&quot;
B00008H2LB|2.0|From the opening 13 seconds of the Foreward track, to the final track (which happens to be a huge hit on pop stations, yes pop- you heard me), &quot;Numb&quot;, Linkin Park: Meteora is an uninspired ride through Linkin Park's dark vortex full of extremely weak songs that lack memorable lyrics and impressive musicianship. I could sum up this whole CD in a few words; uninspired, boring,<BR>cliche, dull, lifeless, but I'm going to make it even more tedious (just like the listening experience!)<BR>and write a review of every song...<br />01. Foreward: Extremely pointless. A bunch of noise and glass breaking. Haven't these guys ever heard of Pink Floyd?<BR>02. Don't Stay: Repetetive, grungy guitar riffs that are repeated throughout the whole damn song, bassline can barely be heard, drums are drum-machine quality, lyrics are about breaking up in a relationship (how innovaitve) but besides that, great way to open up the CD (*cough*). <BR>03. Somewhere I Belong: This is one of the only few good tracks on here. The intro actually sounds okay and the guitar riffs are better than they are in most of the other songs. Still a little boring though, the lyrics are about not fitting in- go figure. The drumwork is still drum machine quality also.<BR>04. Lying From You: Here's a shocker: the song starts off with an electronic beat from the DJ (who sounds like he just hits the &quot;sample&quot; button in every song and thus gets his beats) then in come the grungy, distorted guitars playing to the tune of that electronic beat. The only thing that redeems this song is the slightly cool sounding guitar part in the chorus. The drums sound a tad better as well.<BR>05. Hit The Floor: Same as before, starts off with a DJ sample and then in come the grungy guitars.Boring lyrics, mediocre drumwork, almost mute basslines all equal another bad song.<BR>06. Easier To Run: This is where it starts to get really old. The formula is running dry; electronic beat then guitars, slow chorus with rapping/ soft singing, then a chorus with the leader singer screaming. Right when the guitars come in after the electronic beat, it sounds like nails on a chalk-<BR>board as the uninspired chords pollute the song. You'll press the &gt; button quickly...<BR>07. Faint: Easily the best song on the CD, although thats not even saying much. Its still extremely formula-based and stuff, but the guitars and drums actually sound good. Lyrics are still boring as hell, but overall this song comes together better than all the other songs on the CD.<BR>08. Figure.09: See &quot;Hit The Floor&quot;... Getting really old boys...<BR>09. Breaking The Habit: What... could it be? A song that sounds DIFFERENT?!? Wow. Amazing.<BR>This is like a techno song, and its also one of the best on the CD. The DJ still sounds like he just hits the &quot;sample&quot; button but ah the hell with it. The lyrics- still dull and lifeless.<BR>10. From The Inside: See &quot;Hit The Floor&quot;... The bridge is okay though...<BR>11. Nobody's Listening: No, their not. Maybe if you make some good music instead of this crappy boring rap song with repetetive guitar riffs in the chorus, they will.<BR>12. Session: Its like a break song. The DJ probably just presses &quot;sample&quot; like I said before and winds up with this song. Nothing compared to Cure For The Itch on Hybrid Theory...<BR>13. Numb: Finally, the last song. And go figure, this song offers nothing special either. Aside from the slightly cool sounding electronic intro, that is.<br />There you have it, a review of an over-rated album by the most over-rated band in modern music. And if you think I'm biased, let me tell you that I used to like these guys. I appreciated their music, until I found some better music (and started to play drums and found out their drummer is horrible). And I'm not talking about &quot;underground&quot; or classic rock, theres better music just in mainstream rock! If you like this, thats fine. But just keep searching for music youlike or start playing an instrument...<br />Highlights: Somewhere I Belong, Faint, Breaking The Habit<BR>Downfalls: Every other song, the musicianship, lyrics
B0000009SM|5.0|Through my job as a reporter for a publication that, legally, I can't name here, I recently had an opportunity to interview Mr. Theodore Kaczynski, who was more widely known in the 1980's and 90's as the infamous &quot;Unabomber&quot;.<br />During the course of our disjointed discussion, the subject of music came up unusually often. It was at that point that I became very curious as to how Mr. Kaczynski, or Teddy as he likes to be called, would review the Frank Zappa disc &quot;One Size Fits All.&quot; What does a mad-man hear in his head, and how is it thusly interpreted? (Don't tell me you've never wondered.) So, for the scientifically investigative among you in the Amazon.com community, or simply for the pruriently inquisitive, I reprint that portion of our conversation here for your edification:<br />FRANKLY ZAPPA: Well, Mr. Kaczynski, you have been described as having an almost total absence of interpersonal relationship skills and a large amount of delusional thinking concerning your belief that you were being controlled by modern technology. On May 4, 1998, you were sentenced to serve four consecutive life sentences, and you will probably never be paroled. So, all in all, how do you feel about Frank Zappa's &quot;One Size Fits All&quot;?<br />THEODORE KACZYNSKI: I believe that that particular disc was Zappa and the Mothers. And, please, call me Teddy.<br />FZ: Okay... Teddy... and you are correct, it is the Mothers. But, you must admit, that even you need a record player, or compact disc player, or some device of a 'technological' nature to listen to Zappa. How do you reconcile this seeming anomaly within your profoundly anti-technological philosophy?<br />TK: This is true, to a certain extent. But remember, though, that the power of society to control the individual and the direct physical control of emotions via electrodes and 'chemitrodes,' and the development of super-animals or vegetables with an intellectual potential are another story. Zappa understood this, I think. He addresses this topic quite deliberately with &quot;Evelyn, A Modified Dog.&quot;<br />FZ: That still doesn't address the need for electronic equipment to listen to the song in the first place! Again, how do you reconcile your anti-technology convictions with your Zappa records or compact discs?<br />TK: I did some very interesting experiments in my cabin in Montana that involved the playing of my Frank Zappa discs with nothing more than a sharpened pine twig, my Sofa No. 1, some bailing wire and a solar powered turn-table made out of an empty Cool Whip container. In fact, the crux of &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; is similar to the relationship of Cool Whip topping to its tofutti-like counterpart, low-fat cream cheese. This means terse calories versus glabrous macrobiotics, or, more simply, pine twigs instead of electronic implants. So, my motives concerning listening to Zappa's music were anti-technological, to be sure, but still pro-Zappa, if you can understand that.<br />FZ: Not really. But pine twigs and cream cheese aside, you have been quoted as saying that the prosecutors at your trial distorted your motives, and also played upon your hostility towards mental health professionals. I believe, though, that your refusal to submit to court-ordered examination didn't help your position. With that fact in mind, what would you describe as your favorite song from &quot;One Size Fits All&quot;?<br />TK: Well, with so much revolutionary musical substance on just one album, the challenge that faces any listener donning a pair of menacing Zappa-filled headphones is how to pick just one favorite. &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; represents a musical REVOLUTION, not a musical REFORM. People tend to assume that because a musical revolution involves a much greater change than musical reform does, revolution is more difficult to bring about. Actually, under certain circumstances revolution is much easier than reform. A revolutionary movement can inspire an intensity of commitment that a reform movement cannot inspire, and this is why Zappa was a genius on so many levels. Here he had created a classic yet revolutionary melodrama set to some extraordinary music which creates a quixotic soundscape.<br />FZ: That really didn't answer the question, Teddy.<br />TK: Sorry. &quot;San Ber'dino.&quot;<br />FZ: Now, Teddy, you state that at one time you sought psychiatric help after repeatedly listening to the song titled &quot;Florentine Pogen&quot;, after which you experienced several weeks of intense and persistent excitement involving fantasies of being a &quot;debutante daisy.&quot;<br />TK: So?<br />FZ: Well, you stated that you intended to discuss this vegetal-fixation with a psychiatrist, but changed your mind in the waiting room. You then only asked the doctor in question to water you. So I think the big question here would be, what was the &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; factor in this?<br />TK: Well, while it was true that &quot;Can't Afford No Shoes&quot; with it's bass guitar Hillbilly sensibilities and recession-era insinuations is a reoccurring theme that still resonates today, I think Zappa is still considered too heterogeneous by most folks. Society won't accept Frank's intellectualization on an inter-personal level. It's a societal confusion or rejection.<br />FZ: Society is anti-Zappa? Or anti-botanical?<br />TK: Both, partly. Imagine a society that ignores the Florentine Pogens amongst us, if you will. We should all be free to be a debutante daisy with a color-note organ. This denial is anti-Zappa. We should all be able to drive a '59 Morgan, without the fear that our fan-belt will shrink and get shorter. Zappa is our panaceal ointment in the form of an entirely new and wonderful terrestrial sphere of biological musical phantasm.<br />FZ: Well, Teddy, &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; is certainly a masterpiece, but you and your analogies are nuttier than a blind squirrel in a tin outhouse. Any parting comments?<br />TK: Eat more Zappa, you Po-Jama People.<br />FZ: Well, at least that was decorously stated.ensity of commitment that a reform movement cannot inspire, and this is why Zappa was a genius on so many levels. Here he had created a classic yet revolutionary melodrama set to some extraordinary music which creates a quixotic soundscape.<br />FZ: That really didn't answer the question, Teddy.<br />TK: Sorry. &quot;San Ber'dino.&quot;<br />FZ: Now, Teddy, you state that at one time you sought psychiatric help after repeatedly listening to the song titled &quot;Florentine Pogen&quot;, after which you experienced several weeks of intense and persistent excitement involving fantasies of being a &quot;debutante daisy.&quot; <br />TK: So?<br />FZ: Well, you stated that you intended to discuss this vegetal-fixation with a psychiatrist, but changed your mind in the waiting room.

B000089RVX|2.0|Linkin Park mixed with Sarah McClaclan= Evanescence. Only thing is, those two don't mix well. I swear if I hear &quot;My Immortal&quot; on the radio one more time I'll hit a note (scream) higher than Amy Lee's whiny annoying voice has ever hit. I swear, it seems like the media is trying to shove this band down everybody's throats, and people are buying it. Bring Me To Life was good the first 10 times, but after that (at about the 323574th time its on the radio) it gets very old.
B00004RJ74|5.0|I LOVE THIS FLICK!  <BR> Sorry I just couldnt think of any other way to start this off. If your an aspiring filmmaker with a passion for genre films, this one is up there with &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;.<BR> You get two genre mini-flicks here in one package, who ever thought crime/horror would go together so well? And one of the coolest cinema criminals ever Seth Gecko came to life in this film,how ya gonna beat that.I saw this when it first hit the theatre and Cloony just sold me on his ability, his character here is the epitome of cool.<BR> The rest of the cast is great to, and having Tom Savini, and Fred Williamson onboard along with Michael Parks and John Saxon in the beginning is just heart warming. Speaking of warming Selma Hyak is just devestating as the queen of the vampires. <BR>  Of course Rodriquezs whole cast of usual suspects are here and they are all terrific.<BR> As far as this version of FDTD goes its the one to buy. Takin from the laserdisc version the quality of the pictue is excellent, and the audio is surround with a capital S. The commentary with RR &amp; QT is probably the the most valuable gem in this edtion. If you have a love for this genre stuff the way I do you will practically mind meld with these two as they gab away. <BR>  The documentary &quot;Full Tilt Boogie &quot; is the whole second disk and it is a well made, and educational look at making a film. At least from a broad view.<BR> Love this stuff and I cant wait for RR &amp; QT to give us more, in the mean time if you havent already check out &quot;Love &amp; a 45&quot;, &quot;Love and a Bullet&quot;,&quot;Versus&quot;,&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;('79),&quot;Full Contact&quot;and everything by Rodriquez, and Tarantino.

B00003CXCT|1.0|A complete waste of money, if you ask me. These are not the original films. They are the \\"special editions\\". In the special editions you'll get to see great scenes like: in Empire Strikes Back, Vader gets off his shuttle at the end and is greeted by an actor from Jedi (and on the set of the Death Star from Jedi no less) who's lips are moving, but no words are audible. In Jedi, you'll see, hands down, the worst musical number ever heard and seen in cinema (Lucas's child like humor is NOT funny). The scene between Greedo and Solo from Star Wars, which now looks \\"hokey\\" to say the least. <BR>The best digital release of these films was the expensive widescreen edition on laserdisc...that did the right thing, and kept the extra scenes (like the original Jabba scene from IV) on a bonus disc. <BR>I HATE how film makers like Lucas and Spielberg have remade their classic films to turn a buck, how much money do these guys need? Don't mess with the classics guys.<BR>This wont do any good, but fans should NOT purchase this DVD set to send Lucas a message. We want the originals, not this  tripe.

B00006SFBD|4.0|...but still very solid. Opeth is to me a thing of beauty, the insanely brilliant structure and progression of their work is something unrivaled in metal. The melding of extremes is what makes this band something to fall in love with. This album seems to be missing some of this magic. All previous Opeth albums had a degree of emotion to them that was simply breathtaking, and although i can appreciate that this was to be a \\"darker\\" album, it seem to pale in comparison to Opeth's previous attempts. MAYH was at least on par with this in the \\"dark\\" category, and several notches up in the \\"emotionally deep\\" category... Deliverance just seems to be lacking the depth that Opeth is known for.<br />Delieverance, A Fair Judgement, and For Absent Friends are all quality tracks that do live up mostly to the standards Opeth has set for themselves. For Absent Friends is a short 2:17 long instrumental which actually does a better job of capturing the Opeth spirit. It's sombre, very introspective, and i'll be damned if those chords and melody weren't destined to be together. Some call this one a \\"throwout\\" track which doesn't fit in, and that seems very odd to me :p it's bloody brilliant! ya just gotta be in the right frame of mind.<br />A Fair Judgement also comes close to what Opeth is capable of. Starting out with a soft piano part, it slowly builds to a climax in the middle where the music comes crashing down and through the middle of it all you hear, with transistor radio like sound a beautiful guitar interlude. The mood shifts slightly here to a less dark sound, unfortunately the song does tend to lose a bit of steam towards the end and never reaches a high like the middle section.<br />Deliverance is a mammoth of a song, being Opeth's longest since Black Rose Immortal and has more of the mood shifts and suprises we are used to! It starts with heavy guitars and dissonance abound and eventually resolves into a jazzy clean part, which quite frankly is sort of disturbing... i love it! The song ends with a long repeated riff with some piano backing it, and sets a mood that Opeth has not really used much since Morningrise... you know, that one where the backing takes the foreground and every little blip of sound is taken note of. Repitition with slight variation... a very awesome way to end the song.<br />Besides these 3, i'm not actually that fond of this album. Opeth really did shed most of the \\"emotion\\" they had and replaced it for a much \\"lighter\\" sound that i don't really think suits them. I listen to Opeth because they make me feel things other bands cannot, not because i can headbang to them... there's plenty of bands out there who are less serious and more just fun to listen to whenever. Opeth is reserved for something more special, and this album doesn't have enough of those qualities that make Opeth special to me. Not reccomended unless you are already an Opeth fan and own all the others. Their worst record thus far.
0618526412|5.0|Carson McCullers took her place long ago along side the other Southern greats-Faulkner, O'Connor, Capote, Williams, Welty, Lee, just to name a few.  And while she shares themes and interests with the best of them, her work is somehow different, colored by her own personal neurosis and demons.  As with O'Connor, Capote, Faulkner, or even more contemporary Southern authors like Conroy or McCrae, there is the ever-present element of gothic horror-that underbelly of dank and dark mental instability and fear that only comes from having been a child of the South.  It's something akin to the idea that African-Americans have more \\"soul\\" than the rest of us because they've suffered and been victimized by years of oppression and unfairness. And in a sense, this is also true for the Southern writer, for when it comes to talent, geography will tell.  But state borders along are not enough-timing is important too. Enter Carson McCullers.  Right time, right place.  She, along with Capote, rode the perfect wave of \\"Southernism\\" that was sweeping the country from the 30s through the 60s (although it's never really gone away).  The time seemed perfect for what they were offering, and with burgeoning civil rights movements, war, changing economic times, and above all, an interest in literature-more so than now-the fascination with Southern life, and in particular, that dark underside of things, took hold and swept them and a few others along to stardom.  When \\"The Heart\\" came out, McCullers was an instant celebrity, much in the same way that Capote was when his \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\" appeared on the scene.  Few authors, Southern or not, will ever received that level of attention again.  But McCullers wholly deserved hers, as did Capote.  And while many of McCuller's other works veer off into the totally bizarre and extreme gothic (think \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" or \\"Ballad of the Sad Caf\\") \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" offers us something different.  It's as if the authorhad gleaned her innermost moments and those of the people she's known and loved at just the right time-before life has had a chance to discolor and embitter everything.  \\"Heart\\" is probably one of the most \\"even\\" books I've ever come across-it's sweet without sappiness, yet strong without being overpowering.  The premise alone is brilliant-the two mutes, and Greek no less-outsiders in every way imaginable in a small Southern town, trying to live among narrow-minded and distrustful Southerners.  Talk about a situation pregnant with possibilities.  But the execution is what takes the reader's breath away.  It's as if McCullers were not writing the story at all, but rather channeling this beautiful and mysterious tale, totally unaware of what the outcome would be; totally unashamed and unbiased.  The result is stunning in its simplicity and yet underlying psychological complexity.  Few author have ever attained this level of insight with the possible exception of Flannery O'Connor in her short stories or perhaps Jackson McCrae in \\"The Bark of the Dogwood.\\"  And McCrae, along with every other Southern writer who has come along since the time of McCullers (Conroy, Styron, Grisham, to name a few) owes more than a modicum of debt to this great author.  She, along with the older clan of Faulkner, Wolfe, Tennessee Williams, and others, paved the way for the exemplary storytelling we have today.  That aside, \\"Heart\\" is a book that should never be out of print-one that should take its place alongside Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"  No, \\"Heart\\" is not a \\"Mockingbird,\\" (we only need one), but rather another Southern writer's own story, filtered through a tradition of great writing, colored by geography and the \\"one of a kind\\" way that Southerners have of looking at their world and ours.

055321277X|4.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr.  Hyde was the book of the century.  It was a novel that did a great job dealing with the good versus evil controversy that is within all of us.  The character of Mr. Hyde showed that even someone as good as Dr. Jekyll had a side that wasn't perfect.  The characters had to struggle through the times of the Victorian period when people were very opinionated and were a lot like the people of society today.  Everyone has another side to them  and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde can help you find that side.  I highly recommend reading this great novel.  It can help you deal with the good versus evil that is within you.
0486266885|3.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Review<br /> Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a thought provoking, entertaining novel by Robert Louis Stevenson.  His intricate plot, themes, and use of symbolism make the novel fascinating to read.  The concept is extremely mature and well developed.  Also, Stevenson's unique point of view makes the novel even more interesting.<br /> The themes of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are important in the novel.  The basic and rather obvious main theme is the duality between good and evil.  The duality is manifested in two different ways: the respectable Dr. Jekyll and the evil Mr. Hyde.  Dr. Jekyll is a hypocritical doctor who has an evil deep in side of him that he desperately tries to get rid of throughout the novel.   He transforms into Mr. Hyde hoping to reduce his aggressions and obsession with his evilness. This, however, proves to be fatal.<BR> <BR> Stevenson's unique point of view reinforces the mystery of the novel.  The main point of view is of Mr.Utterson.  He is a quiet, respectable lawyer who is extremely observant to his surroundings.  Through his point of view, we see things just as they appear to him, making the novel interesting to read.  Towards the end of the novel, we are introduced to two different narrators, Mr. Lanyon and Dr. Jekyll.  Mr. Lanyon, the doctor, makes the novel clear and describes, in more detail, the process that transformed Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde.  The last chapter, narrated by Dr. Jekyll brings the novel together.  Dr. Jekyll plainly describes how the soul is made of two separate distinctions: the good and the evil.  Dr. Jekyll's experiments with good and evil turn out completely failed.
055321277X|2.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one of  a kind.  I could not get very interested in the book because I am not  in to science fiction novels.  Another reason I did not enjoy it is because it was kind of scary with all of the killilng and evil.  It did have a plot that could keep a readers attention, but it was too evil to keep it very long.  Personally I did not take very well to the fact that that the evil side was brought out in such a good man.  I do not recommend reading Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde unless you enjoy mystery and science fiction.
B0000CFW87|5.0|To all you folks out there who think that Josh is a star now because of his 'good looks', you obviously haven't even LISTENED to his CD's. Closer is STUNNING. His voice is the most beautiful thing I have heard in 30 years of listening to music!! I first heard his voice on my car radio and I was so stunned that I almost ran off the road!! I BOUGHT HIS CD BEFORE I KNEW WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE or knew ANYTHING about him. Since that time I have become a huge fan because he's also a wonderful human being: kind, humble, generous, funny, and dedicated to his family, friends, fans, and profession.<br />And one more thing--to all you rap, hard rock, and classical music fans who come here and review this CD and give it one star and say Josh has no talent: if you don't like Josh's kind of music, then WHY are you coming here dissing it?? Why don't you critique CD's in YOUR world?? I would never consider reviewing a rap CD, because I would give ALL rap CD's one star--I simply don't like that kind of music. To come here and do that to Josh's CD is just plain hatefulness!! And note to classical music folks: this is NOT a classical album, it has NO classical songs on it, and Josh himself says he DOES NOT sing classical music. So stop comparing him to classical vocalists, etc.<br />So, in summary, Closer is just a CD filled with beautiful love songs in different languages (half in English), and if you like that kind of music, you WILL NOT be disappointed in this CD!!!!

Through Ender's story, and the men monitoring him, we learn all the lessons of strategy and command; and how to grab every available resource.  At first, he realizes gravity has no meaning in a null-gravity situation.  Upon promotion and denied an opportunity to learn, he trains with a sub-class, defying convention.  When he first disobeys stupid commands, he turns defeat into stalemate.  When a sub-leader recognizes his value, but the commander doesn't, he turns a suicide mission into a strategic advantage for his army.  When he is finally given command, he throws out the rulebook in favor of what works.  <br />Ultimately, his genius is not just by understanding strategies and tactics that work but also how to utlitze other people in his favor.  He trains his subcommanders how to lead and recognize strategic and tactical opportunites, but also gains their respect as a commander.  When the wargames are rigged more and more against his favor, he simply responds by adopting new, innovative, and effective methods against his enemeies.  <br />I found the end-game predictable, but beyond the military victory, I found a kind of solice.  Ender never really wanted to beat an enemy; he wanted them to stop fighting and live in peace.  Perhaps that is the true genius of Ender's Game - he never wanted war, but when forced into it, he played to win the war forever.  <br />I haven't read the sequels, but I hope in them Ender focuses his mind toward creating peace instead of war.  There is just as much strategy in winning a cold war and living in peace as there is to a hot war and fighting with many dead on each side.
1592400876|5.0|I'm the ideal audience for this book:  I'm a stickler for grammar and punctuation.  The book is a light and enteraining read, and I was surprised at how much I learned, since I'm a professional writer and I thought I had paid attention in school.  Every English-speaker needs to read this book!
B0001N1RU8|1.0|Diana is a great piano player and he is a great writer. (the latter has never been proven to me) I don't LOVE her voice at the best of times, but on this album she sounds really bad. The lyrics are terrible too. If Declan is such a talented writer, he sure isn't instructing his amateur wife very well. Diana needs to get back to her roots, forget her over-inflated ego husbands desperate attempt at horning in on her career, and do what she does best, playing the piano and singing low bluesy songs.  I love DK, but this album makes me wish I was a downloader. If only he was as great as they think he is. Maybe she should hire her 'best friend' Elton JOHN's friend Bernie Taupin and fire the guy she lives with. I really think she believes Declan is an assett to her if he involves himself in her music, I hope this makes her think twice about that.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|&quot;Big Fish&quot; wants to be so much bigger and better than it is. Indeed, the audience wants it to be too - what movie afficionado didn't go into &quot;Big Fish&quot; secretly hoping for Tim Burton to redeem his recently terrible judgment? And yet at the end, I at least was left unsatisfied.<br />Oddly, the comparison that leaps to mind is &quot;Road to Perdition,&quot; Alan Ball's well-intentioned and beautifully crafted movie that suffers from too much telling and not enough story. Both &quot;Big Fish&quot; and &quot;Perdition&quot; are stories about fathers and sons trying to come to grips with one another and their relationship as death slowly creeps up. Both revolve around sons who don't really know their fathers, and fathers who don't know their sons. And both end up feeling hollow and empty at the end.<br />Make no mistake - &quot;Perdition&quot; was well-acted (with a cast that includes Tom Hanks, Jude Law, Paul Newman and talented newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, it would be hard NOT to be), and so is &quot;Fish&quot; (Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny Devito, and Helena Bonham-Carter all turn in fine performances, though McGregor's is the only role with any real substance). And both &quot;Perdition&quot; and &quot;Fish&quot; boast beautifully crafted visuals (&quot;Perdition&quot; owing to the legendary Conrad Hall, &quot;Fish&quot; presumably to the mind of Burton himself and the team he works with). For all their emptiness, both movies are candy to the eyes.<br />The story is where they fall flat. &quot;Fish&quot; seems like a movie that was poorly edited. The story aims to focus on Billy Crudup and Albert Finney's relationship as son and father respectively, trying to overcome years of estrangement before Finney succumbs to cancer. Crudup tries to sort the mythical stories his father has always told from the man himself, to find footing for his own memories of his dad. Good premise. But Burton drops the ball. Their relationship is never really fleshed out - I don't think they spend more than ten minutes on screen together. As Crudup's character points out himself at one point, he is a footnote in his dad's story, which (for all its perhaps poetic discourse on the son's life itself) only leaves us with little or no sympathy for the character at the end.<br />The &quot;voyage&quot; in the movie is nothing more than a rehashing of his father's flashback-style tales, which Crudup complains bitterly about having heard thousands of times before - yet this time he somehow finds meaning in them? Perhaps part of the problem is Crudup's flat performance, but it seems that the movie would have been better served by a few more scenes between father and son.<br />Make no mistake, there are scenes of breathtaking beauty in this film. The moment when Ewan McGregor spies his future wife is magnificent. Finney's voice, aged and sickly, drapes over the scene, dipping from world-weary and misty recollection to sudden and poignant tenderness, his obvious adoration for the woman untouched by his long years of life and current painful suffering. Another comes when Finney and Lange share a fully-clothed moment in a tub together, one of the few moments of truly raw emotion in the movie.<br />The ending feels forced and contrived - the movie plummets rather than eases into a climax that is less of an easing out than a frenzied victory march pushed to a run. It seems like Burton suddenly realized the movie was coming up on two hours and decided to pull the plug. For once, I think an extra half hour of celluloid would have better served the movie as a whole.<br />Burton's talents as a filmmaker are undeniable - and considering his other works, which dive heavily into fantasy, this first attempt at a new style is admirably deft and well-crafted (though certainly it contains fantastical elements). I leave it to the viewer to decide ultimately whether that admiration of filmmaking stylistics is enough to call this a success.
B000148KK2|2.0|After waiting for this CD with anticipation I am so sorry to have to say that this one &quot;bit the big one&quot; for me. When I purchase a DK CD it is for her outstanding voice, and to appreciate the music that she (and her band) plays. I got neither of these with this CD. The words on some of the songs were like.... what the heck is she singing about??? and her voice in general on this overall CD was different as well as if she were trying something new (I'm sure that this is due to Elvis Costello's influence) I was trying to figure out what exactly I didn't like about it... and I think she was singing weird.. minor inflexions with her tone and range, that just did not help some of the songs. I can say that I'm not the type of fan that can't handle my favorite songstress trying something different but darn it!!! I just couldn't get the &quot;feel&quot; of this one. I listened to it at least 5 - 6 times since getting this CD.<br />SO to the possible buyers out there if you are a &quot;die-hard&quot; fan of Mrs. Krall-Costello buy with caution this is not her typical music do not purchase with that in mind..... think different, you probably need to come to it as if it is a new singer that you are being introduced to.<br />Respectfully Reviewed
0385421982|3.0|i don't regard this as grisham's best novel, as it is a bit weak both in content and in narration.<BR>the pace is fast, but i won't consider them exciting enough... the usual stuff, like killers, sleazy reporters, innocent protagonists, dirty politicians etcetc. they are somewhat expected. and i'm espcially not happy with the ending, for the final romance is utterly unconvincing.<BR>i am also disappointed at the characterisation.  Darby Shaw lacks depth, and has the character of the average heroine. <BR>if you want grisham's best in words (not movies), go for THE CLIENT, THE RAINMAKER or THE FIRM. they're all my favourite.
B000066NW0|1.0|That is all I have to say about Avril. Her career is obviously at death's door, even though she never deserved any fame whatsoever. That is the only good thing about her, which is really quite sad. But really, is it possible for her upcoming album to match the insane success of &quot;Let Go&quot;? Avril's target audience is growing up, one day they will be embarassed to say they were once a fan of hers. One thing does scare me though: when Avril's career has ended, who will be taking her place? That really is a scary thought. If you like this album, I'd suggest listening to some other, better artists, and you will forget this little notalent ever existed (even that new Courtney Love album is better than this!). And for those of you who have never heard Avril (probably few), steer clear of this atrocity!
0671027344|5.0|This haunting novel is about the dilemma of passivity and growing up. The protagonist, Charlie, is entering a new world. He's entering high school for the first time and he learns about who he is to the rest of the world. Charlie is a wallflower. He's different from everyone else and he shares his feelings and thoughts to us through letters. This book is more intimate than a diary, though we don't know where Charlie lives, or who he's writing to. Charlie goes through uncharted territory, living his life and running from it all at the same time. It's a great coming-of-age story. It shows the hardships and trials of growing up in life, and competing to fit in. This novel demonstrates what it's like to grow up through a teenager's mind.
B00005JMSE|5.0|i have one word for this magnificent masterpiece that guilermo del toro has prepared us for (guilermo might Probably the best director of all time especially with horror, Now that i have seen most of guilermos films i have put my other favorite director Paul Verhoeven at second place and guilermo at Number one! Guilermo is the king... for instance look at the genius's work in blade 2 it was much better then the first. Whoever thinks this movie blows they honestly,seriously,truthfully need to get there head examined because this film is powerful. To be honest with you THIS FILM ROCKS. I am definitely going to get this film when it comes out on DVD i will not miss out on this. Hellboy was much much better then daredevil and spiderman. I dont know if it was better then the punisher though. Whoever hasent seen this masterpiece go see it u will be in for a good treat. Just sit back and enjoy the ride take my advice do not miss out on this film this is a must see pull out your wallets and go watch this Excellent film.
0385504209|3.0|I don't usually read &quot;bestsellers&quot; but my wife brought this home from the library and as an author myself, though not nearly so successful a one as Dan Brown (author of this book), I was moved to take a look. I started reading it and was swept right up. It was fast paced, polished and intriguing. In fact, I put down another book I was reading to finish this one, so it certainly worked for me at that level.<br />But it didn't work at a deeper level. In the end The Da Vinci Code seemed highly artificial in construction, with characters that were barely more than ciphers inserted in the plot to play their parts but capable of little more. They had no inner life to speak of and nothing about them to make me believe in their lives or experiences.<br />The plot itself hinges on an idea of conspiracies and secret societies that span millenia and involve a hidden history of Christianity. But the notions presented in relation to this are all relatively common place to anyone already familiar with the history of religion and do not suggest any real conspiracy of ancient secrets. I won't say too much here about them, for fear of giving away the story's thrust, which, after all, is its one real virtue. But suffice it to say that the endless puzzles within puzzles, the seemingly arcane expositions when individuals who should have a better handle on facts seemingly don't, the mystery of people who are not what they seem, the idea of hidden beliefs about a &quot;sacred feminine&quot; (whatever that is) that have been long suppressed by institutional religion, and the endless bait and switch tactics of the exposition begin to grate. It got to the point where I knew that, as soon as one thing was revealed to us, it would only prove another way-station in an intellectual treasure hunt that was seemingly premised on all sorts of forced allusions and esoteric interpretations that could not be guessed in advance (a rather unfair trick, it seems to me).<br />About two thirds of the way through, I did guess the identity of the hidden bad guy and after that it was just a matter of waiting to see how the author brought this to the surface. When he finally did, it proved an anti-climax that left me somewhat cold. And the book's final end, itself, which follows the revelation of the hero's antagonist, struck me as particularly forced and a let-down. There wasn't much of a secret there, when all the sound and fury had blown itself out.<br />Still, I have to acknowledge that the book kept me reading and was interesting. Is that enough to warrant bestseller status? Well, perhaps it is, when conjoined with a lot of pseudo-speculation about religion and belief. At the least the book entertained and that, I suppose, is why it sells. Mr. Brown has my admiration for that.<br />SWMthe way through, I did guess the identity of the hidden bad guy and after that it was just a matter of waiting to see how the author brought this to the surface.

B000021YQV|3.0|I haven't heard in this album in well over a year so I'm going strictly off memory. I borrowed this cd for about two months and listented to it constantly. Its has some pretty good tunes, the singles, &quot;Chop Suey&quot; &quot;aerials&quot; and &quot;toxicity&quot; are probably the best tracks, I like the boundless aggression of Deer Dance and the pleading vocals of &quot;Forest&quot;. But often the political messages cause the music to suffer, and about half of these songs lack a semblance of melody and end up sounding the same. This album's often made out to be some sort of epic, its good, but nothing spectacular.

B00006JKOL|5.0|Jethro Tull was definitely on a winning streak in the 1970's beginning with 1971's &quot;Aqualung&quot; through 1979's &quot;Stormwatch&quot;. Their 1975 classic &quot;Minstrel In The Gallery&quot; continues on with the progressive elements and adds a heavy dose of medieval folk music into the picture. While there are more acoustic moments here than on previous Tull albums, there is still plenty of heavy electrifying rock and roll here as well.<br />The album's 8-minute title track effortlessly fuses the folk and rock elements with Ian Anderson's tender acoustic opening followed by a stellar hard-rock workout with great guitar work from Martin Barre and tight ensemble playing. &quot;Cold Wind To Valhalla&quot; and &quot;Black Satin Dancer&quot; feature similar musicality. Ian's flute work on the latter track is particularly striking. &quot;Requiem&quot; takes things down a notch with Ian's gentle acoustic guitar and vocal accompanied by a string and wind ensemble led by future Tull member David Palmer. Simply beautiful.<br />&quot;One White Duck/010=Nothing At All&quot; is also an all acoustic piece with a slight Irish Celtic vibe to it. Then, it's off into progressive rock territory once again with the nearly 17-minute &quot;Baker Street Muse&quot;. This long piece is similar to &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; in parts but is not a rewrite or retread of that famous epic. The entire band as a whole shines its brightest on this track especially Anderson, Barre and drummer Barriemore Barlow. David Palmer's orchestral arrangements further enhance the excitement of this piece.<br />The entire album closes with a brief 40-second epilogue entitle &quot;Grace&quot; which features Anderson singing in a echoing vibrato.<br />In addition to the original album tracks, the remastered CD of &quot;Minstrel In The Gallery&quot; includes five additional tracks, the all-acoustic &quot;Summerday Sands&quot; and &quot;March Of the Mad Scientist&quot;, the instrumental flute tour-de-force &quot;Pan Dance&quot; (which once again features great orchestral arrangements) and brief live extracts from &quot;Cold Wind To Valhalla&quot; and the title track.<br />Without a doubt, this is a great album and is quite enjoyable. The album displays Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull expanding their musical pallette in a positive manner. With its fusing of hard rock with acoustic folk stylings, &quot;Minstrel In The Gallery&quot; is one of Jethro Tull's finest albums.

B00005M989|5.0|It took me 20 years to catch up to Prince's stuff. <BR>Back in the day, his music--much less some of his album covers (for instance, what WAS he thinking with the &quot;Lovesexy&quot; cover???)--were a bit too racy for little kids (and I was a little kid back in the early 80s when the Purple One's most groundbreaking stuff was coming out.) So, I never really got into his music until much later on.<BR>Anyway, 20 years later, I realize both that &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; ain't about a car and that this dude from Minneapolis is a freakin' genius. The gems on this 17-song album are a great primer into the wild world of Prince. Such essential tunes included here are &quot;Purple Rain,&quot; &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; (although in its abridged single version), &quot;Kiss,&quot; &quot;Alphabet Street,&quot; &quot;Sign 'O' The Times,&quot; and &quot;Gett Off&quot; (a song I love simply because of the slick little reference he makes to James Brown's &quot;Mother Popcorn.&quot;) <BR>That said, this is by no means a complete anthology of his work. &quot;I Feel For You,&quot; &quot;Soft and Wet,&quot; and &quot;Adore&quot; are essential Prince songs and are nowhere to be found here. In fact, if it had been left up to me, I would have included &quot;If Was Your Girlfriend&quot; from &quot;Sign 'O' the Times&quot; instead of &quot;U Got the Look.&quot; But that's just me...<BR>Paraphrasing a previous reviewer, this is a great starter kit for casual fans or people looking to replace those singles that got lost, scratched, or broken from the 80s.<BR>In a word: essential.
B0000074GK|5.0|I had this CD about 10 years ago when I was going through some tough times. And borrowed it to a friend who miss placed it. I have been looking for it ever since. This is one of the BEST Cd's that I have ever owned. It took me 10 years but I finally found it. And that alone should say something for the music on this CD. I love it, It is one of the best music CD's that I have ever owned, And will now again own. And you if like Bad Company, You will love this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought Firefly for myself recently because the box looked pretty and I remembered catching maybe 5 minutes of it while it was on TV.  Boy, am I glad I picked up that 'pretty box.'<br />The reason Firefly is so good is good storytelling.  Now, that may sound like a simple enough thing to have, but few TV shows in recent memory can claim to tell their story well.<br />Picture it like this, Firefly is what a show like X-Files could have been if X-Files' 'startling plot revelations' were actually going somewhere.  I DID like X-Files, it just went nowhere fast, which is something Firefly can never be accused of.  If there is a startling revelation on Firefly is actually does mean something and isn't just included to be shocking.  As a viewer I appreciate that.<br />Firefly is well crafted with wonderfully deep characters you will care about, and a plot that has a definite direction but is NEVER predictable.  And THAT is the reason I love Firefly and eagerly share it with my friends and family. ^_^

B0000AQVCL|3.0|It's clear from listening to _Get Born_ that the members of Jet wear their influences on their sleeves, chests, legs, and pretty much any easily visible surface on their body.  One can hear elements of T-Rex, Iggy Pop (I'm still convinced that &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl?&quot; is their take on Pop's &quot;Lust For Life&quot;), The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and fellow Aussies AC/DC.  But considering how many of their contemporaries share those influences and craft similar-sounding music, it's hard to call this a standout album.  But at the heart of it, _Get Born_ is good, straightforward rock.
B000002J0N|4.0|These past members of such seemingly divergent folk/pop/rock bands as Buffalo Springfield and The Hollies had forged an unlikely yet satisfying alliance in the late 1960s and blazed an unexpected trail into the world of acid rock, melding three-part harmony with radical lyrics and backing that ranged from blistering guitar to a capella.<br />So it's understandable that their semi-amicable breakup in 1971 left a hole in our hearts.  While they recorded solo and in varying pairs, CSN(Y) was clearly more than the sum of its parts.  The 1977 release &quot;CSN&quot; made this ultimately clear.<br />There are a handful of tracks here that are relatively weak, but that's certainly a matter of opinion.  Crosby's playfully self-deprecating (but still drug-muddled) &quot;Anything At All&quot; is worth skipping, IMO, as are &quot;Carried Away&quot; and &quot;Cold Rain.&quot;  But heck, that's not bad, three nominal filler tunes surrounded by this much brilliance (in spite of their often obtuse lyrics).<br />Crosby's shining moment is &quot;In My Dreams,&quot; where he fights through his longtime addiction problems to connect with everyone on a visceral level:  That moment where you meet That Someone who you think could be The One.  Stills has more memorable moments, such as the gorgeous and poignant &quot;See the Changes&quot; and the hopeful rocker &quot;I Give You Give Blind,&quot; as well as the underrated &quot;Run From Tears.&quot;  Nash penned the biggest radio hit from this set, a bittersweet song called &quot;Just a Song Before I Go,&quot; and also the emotionally charged &quot;Cathedral,&quot; a sad song about a man who can't see Christ clearly because of the sins of those who have worn His name like a shield to hide their evil. (Crusade, televangelists, etc.)<br />All in all a very satisfying set, memorable and well worth an honored place in the collection of any fan of classic rock.
B0001N1RU8|2.0|I have all of Diana Krall's CD's, and you can see her evolution as an artist with each one. For me, the two brilliant CDs The Look Of Love and When I Look In Your Eyes were the pinnacle of her achievement. This one I don't like.

So i bought d12 world and loved it then since i had some good dough on me i bought 8mile soundtrack devils night slim shady lp and this disc and loved em all. Theres allotta funny songs on this album and the other 1s. Im also glad eminem dissed the Insane clown posse cuz they remind me of the KKK and should rot in hell.eminem is not the best rapper tho lots of people are better than him but hes got a good career a head of him. this album was great lyrically and beatwise. i think when eminem raps with his assertive voice and flow and good lyrics you just get into it. great album peace.

0451199871|5.0|Dolly Bantry was slowly waking to the usual sounds of her well run household.  Her peaceful, predictable life was thoroughly disrupted when her maid entered, bringing not the expected morning tea, but news of a body in the library!  Not only a body, but a young woman! Platinum blonde no less!   When her husband could supply no explanation for this occurance Dolly did the only sensible thing - she called her friend and neighbor, Jane Marple.<br />Miss Marple set about her inquiries and, aided by the police, began to sort out the mess.  The trail led to the film industry and then to the nearby seaside resort of Danemouth where the wealthy guests and the staff of the Majestic Hotel become embroiled in the mystery.  Ultimately Miss Marple solves the crime, bringing the culprits to justice and saving her friends from a life time of suspicion.<br />This 1941 work reflects small town English life and morals of the time.  The reader needs to keep this mind and not try to see the story in a more contremporary light.  It mattered very much at that time whether or not a couple was married or living in sin, teenage girls could be convinced that a talent scout could pick them out of a crowd and the suspicion of a middle-aged man's daliance with a young woman would lead to social exclusion for the whole family.  <br />The plot is, as always in a Christie mystery, fairly laid out with all the clues available to the reader.  While the reader may get a suspicion of a red herring and even narrow the field of suspects I doubt that any will arrive at all the answers before Miss Marple reveals all.
B000060K4O|5.0|After 20 years GHOSTBUSTERS holds up even with the pre-digital special effects, etc.  The film works because it is just plain funny, inventive (the E.P.A. are the baddies in the film...How inventive is that?!), and original. Also it has a great cast (with Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis, and Annie Potts) and great New York City locations (even though the Ghostbusters headquarters, the abandoned fire house, is actually a Las Angeles location). The DVD has all the &quot;bells and whistles&quot;, but there is something missing and that the producers of the disc did not include the music video for Ray Parker's theme song.  This was a top-ten video back in 1984 and was played constantly on MTV and all other music video shows way back when. It was just as funny as the film as all four Ghostbusters (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson) appear with singer Ray Parker Jr. near the end of the video dancing down Times Square. If the music video had been included, the DVD would have been complete.  Otherwise the film itself is a classic that has stood the test of time.

Easily among the lines of classics like Passion &amp; Warfare, Surfing with the Alien, Texas Food, etc. Opens up with Yngwie's classic &quot;Black Star&quot;, which has a riding rhythm and killer guitar work. &quot;Icarus' Dream Suite op. 4&quot; and &quot;Now Your Ships are Burned&quot; are also killer tracks. The whole album is an inspired masterpiece.
B00005V9HH|3.0|&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; is perfectly watchable, but far from great. It probably didn't help that I watched this in 2004, well past all the breathless hoopla and the awards. It probably also doesn't help that I'm not a big Kevin Spacey fan-he is a bit histrionic for my taste. Gabrile Bryne was excellent in this movie though, as was Stephen Baldwin. The plot moves reasonably fast, but is ultimately unsatisfactory. Everyone's heard of the plot by  now:  5 random guys (the &quot;usual suspects') are brought in for questioning on a crime, then get together to plot a new crime. Only one-Spacey-survives at the end and tells his tale of a super bad guy who engineered all of it. The problem with the plot is that it has a lot of holes in it, isn't as clever as it purports to be, and ultimately fails to make sufficient sense. The thing with having a twist at the end is that the whole movie still needs to make perfect sense upon reviewing, which in my opinion, this movie failed to do! The motives of the characters (especially Soze) were far from clear---does a mastermind of that sort need these 2 bit criminals to help him along? How could he ensure that he wouldn't get caught up in it at the end? How does the Steve Baldwin character come up with the plot in the first place? How do the cops even get their hands on Soze if he's so good? Wasn't there a better, less elaborate way for him to off the witness?, etc. etc. There are just way too many questions...and the plot ultimately proves to be dull and contrived. Some of the scenes are just too self-important and not clever enough by half (much in the way that &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is not clever enough, to use a recent analogy!). The only redeeming factors are an engaging cast and a quick (if rambling and somewhat pointless) plot. This isn't a bad movie but it doesn't live upto the hype. If you really want a well-crafted movie with a big surprise at the end, watch &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. If you want a clever movie that makes you work to put everything together, watch &quot;Memento&quot;.
B000089RVX|5.0|It would seem people either love the CD or simply don't care for it.  I personally enjoy the music, but I think the band has some catching up to do with the lead singer.  The music isn't all that intricate, but I personally base the majority of my opinion on lyrics when assessing music.  The lyrics appeal to a smaller audience, which is why I believe there are so many negative things to say about them.  These people simply don't understand the mind set behind the lyrics.  I should hope musically there will be improvements, but lyrically I'm overly impressed...
B00008CLOA|5.0|FINDING DARK SIDE IN SACD WAS WHAT PROMPTED ME TO FINALLY PUT OUT SOME CASH FOR A PLAYER, AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.  THE SOUND QUALITY AND DYNAMIC PRESENCE OF THIS MIX IN MULTI-CHANNEL WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE FIRST FEW SECONDS OF PLAY AND WHAT A JOY IT WAS.  FLOYD MAY HAVE IT'S DETRACTORS, BUT US TRUE FANS KNOW THAT FLOYD WAS THE GREATEST BAND OF THE LAST CENTURY.  FOR THOSE OF YOU BUYING SACD BEWARE!!!  MANY OF THE REMIXES ARE NOT IN MULTI-CHANNEL FORMAT AND EVEN THOUGH THE STEREO QUALITY IS BETTER YOU WILL FEEL RIPPED-OFF---ARE YOU LISTENING SONY-PHILLIPS?  CHECK<BR>THE PACKAGE SACD BEFORE YOU BUY-MAKE SURE IT SAYS MULTI-CHANNEL.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The first Matrix was incredible. The second one sucked but i sat through that one without too much of a fuss.  But this one was basically &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; with a gun here or there.  Trust me, if you liked the first Matrix dont watch this one.
B000002AS3|5.0|i've had it for years and it rarely leaves my side. If I were placed on a desert island and had to pick a few CD's to be left with, this would be the first. The definition of a rock album.
B0000WN0VY|2.0|By looking at the reviews, it seems like most of the people that own this album are cult fans that have seen Damien in concert and things. I first heard of Damien Rice on VH1, where I saw the video for \\"Volcano\\". I decided to check the album out to see what it was like, and I just couldn't get into it.<br />I tried to give this album a chance, but I just think it's boring. In fact, I almost fell asleep a couple of times while I was listening to it. Also, Damien doesn't have the greatest singing voice, so it's really annoying to hear him oversinging in songs like \\"I Remember\\". Speaking of which, things don't get much better with the insane production in that song, not to mention the terrible tenor chorus in \\"Cold Water\\". And \\"Cannonball\\" ends really abruptly.<br />Most of the songs on here seem to blow right by you without being very memorable. And the last song, \\"Eskimo\\", is followed by not one, but TWO hidden tracks, which are okay. Too bad I can't say the same for this album. Maybe it should have been called Z (as in sleeping) instead of O.<br />Anthony Rupert
B00000IBVC|4.0|Turandot is an excellent opera and this production does it justice. The spectacle of it all, and the occasion (on the original site!!!) combine to make it near-to-perfect.<BR>The only things that keep it from that beloved fifth star:<BR>Larin's acting leaves a good deal to be desired.<BR>Casolla's singing is not bad, but is much less than ideal.<BR>Mehta's choices in conducting, especially his tempos, are exaggerated and inaccurate.<BR>But aside from that, Larin's singing is heavenly, and Fritolli's voice and her acting are superb. Yimou's stage direction is the perfect combination of Chinoiserie and operatic refinement, and is visually stunning.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Hey, so is it comming for xmast??<BR>that would be great, does any one know when will be available as an advance order? Amazon knows about this??anyone know a date.<BR>This is a great new. i garantee this will be a best seller<BR>cheers
B00006LJ72|5.0|I absolutely love this box set. Ever since I got it, I haven't been able to stop listening to all of its CDs. I would recommend this to anybody who is either Irish, loves Gaelic music, or just plain loves Enya's music. Trust me, you will cherish this collection just as I have for as long as you own it.
B000089RVX|5.0|How so many young guys (15-30) with the macho ego take their time to bash this cd because of 2 reasons.<br />1- They can't stomach the thought of a woman fronting a &quot;hard&quot; edged band. <br />   This is due in part to the image that Rock has held over the last 30 years. Guys disregarding law, being rebels and bragging about their conquests and adventures behind guitar riffs and drum solos. So when a woman shows that it's not just a &quot;guy thing&quot; the entire philosophy is confussing to the young adolesant man and we all know they hate confussion so they get angry and then aggressive (don't believe me then read some of their &quot;reviews&quot;)<br />2 - The anti Linkin Park stance.<br />    This band has been hit with as much net hate as I've ever seen (that includes the Backstreet Boys and NSync). I can only attribute this resentment to the fact that A: women their age love it (paying less attention to these young guys) and B: They feel that they too could do the same and it takes &quot;zero talent&quot; <br />Jealousy is a horrible thing. <br />I drive to work on my 77 Indian , have had long hair since as far back as I can remember and have seen all types of music become so popular that it was news worthy then fade away because fashion and trends fade over time.<br />Evanescense may be very popular right now , but that shouldn't dispell you from giving this entire cd a fair listen through.<BR>Without expectation, without regard, no heresay or preconcieved notions about what it &quot;should be&quot; and you will be more than impressed. You'll probably do what most people who enjoy creative innovative music do. Hit play and start the excitement over agian.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Great movie... a lot of action, great storyline, some a little bit &quot;out there&quot;, but what else would you expect from the guy that created Pulp Fiction and Reservior Dogs (sp?).<br />At least Neo flew off after he saw that the odds were starting to look grim... one would think Uma would've done the same. :-)<br />I can't believe I waited for this to get to video to see it... #2 will definitely be seen in the theater.
0345350499|5.0|I received this book in the early 90's as a birthday present - and have loved it ever since.  I've read it through at least 10 times, each time picking up a little bit more (which is easy to do given the length!)  It puts a whole new spin on King Arthur's half sister, Moragaine, aka Morgan le Fey.  I think the introuduction where Morgaine speaks really adds a lot to this story that is filled with love, deception, pride, loyalty, revenge and amazing strengths and weaknesses of character. I do believe Arthur could have been portrayed as a bit stronger - he was strongly influenced by so many people, I often wondered if he ever made any decisions on his own.  Now that the prequels are out, I recommend reading them first.  They set the tone and help you understand Vivaine's reasons behind actions that otherwise make your heart scream.  I also recommend the reading the book before seeing the movie.  There were many scenes cut out of the movie and much that needed explanation.  This book was - by far - MZB's masterpiece!
B00011RPB0|5.0|For those of you who didn't enjoy this film and put it down to it &quot;bores the heck out of almost everyone that sees the thing&quot;, &quot;...a montage of seemingly unrelated scenes&quot;, well,  quite frankly you are lacking in culture. Perhaps you should stop watching so many Hollywood blockbusters and try foreign films for variety. You may just learn something! There is a lot of beauty simply in the way Sophia has shot this film, the cinematography, the mood she captures (the actors, both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson did a brilliant job!), the humour in experiencing different cultures, it is a work of art and Sophia should be (as she was at the Oscars) commended for her work!
B00005A0N5|1.0|It appears this band got 40 of their friends to write reviews because there's nothing on this album worth listening to. This album is the musical equivalent of the tuner car. Like the morons who put $15,000 rims on a $10,000 Honda Civic, the dynamics of the band don't make any sense. Blending a good opera voice with a decent metal band is like putting shrimp in a milkshake...you might like both things, but mixing them together only makes you want to throw up. The only people who should buy this CD are people living with their parent's who feel the need to drive them insane with their music.
055321277X|4.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was an good book. It wasn't a great book because I thought that telling the story through someone else's, Mr. Utterson, who wasn't really part of the story except for being Jekyll's lawer. I am not sure that I liked the way the novel was organized.  It skipped from place to place and was moderately difficult to follow. Even though the plot was scattered around I enjoyed the thought of a man having two separate lives.  I also enjoyed the violence.  I am a violence type of guy.  I enjoy violent killing sprees.  The trampling that Mr. Hyde did to the little girl made me want to read more.  Things like that caught me by surprise.  All in all it was a great novel.  I recommend this novel to anyone who hasn't read it before.
B000089RVX|5.0|This one of those rare CDs that you can listen to over and over. This band is hard to classify because they have such a wide range. Some times they sound almost classical and sometimes they sound like Metallica. Regardless of the pace of the song, the vocals of Amy Lee are superb.
0385472951|1.0|I see that used hardcover versions of this book are being sold for one penny.  Save your money!  Who wants to read a book without one likable character?  Once the story is established, it is a predictable march to the finish line.  Oh, I forgot the  stupid ironic ending thrown in for good measure.  Skip this one and get one of Grisham's better books.
B000002J2F|5.0|Well, I heard Genesis for the first time in my life in 1989, I was 8 years old, and I was immersed in the AOR/Hard/Glam/Pop universe of the 80's. I'm still a fan of the sound of the 80's, but with the course of the years, the musical evolution is inevitable, I discovered the progressive rock and discovered fantastic bands and artists, like Yes, Pink Floyd, ELP, King Crimson, Spock's Beard, Transatlantic, and of course, the old school Genesis, and others. So, I started to explore these bands, and the Genesis discography as well, and fantastic albums like \\"Selling England By The Pound\\", \\"Nursery Crime\\", \\"Foxtrot\\", \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\", \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\", and also the pop Genesis, witch I heard a little bit before, with excelent releases like \\"Abacab\\", \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"Genesis\\", as well as the transition albums, like \\"And Then There Were Three\\" and this one, \\"Duke\\". With my ecletic taste of music, I can say that I continue to love every Genesis eras, with no distinction, so I don't see what's the poin of people who make noise, just because the band decided to go through different directions. So, it's pop music, so what? It's good pop music, not the crap that TV and radio tries to push to us these days (Britney \\"Bitch\\" Spears, new metal bands, boy bands and so on). Yes, good pop music really exists, it's not a legend, for those who don't know! I can tell you a lot of good examples, like Brian Adams, Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Seal (my favorite pop artist), Elton John, Lionel Ritchie, Richie Kotzen, Tina Turner, Michael Jackson (of early days), and the pop Genesis era, as well. I don't care about labels, they only exist for me as a way of organize the things, but in my opinion, good music is good music, no matter what label they give. And this is, for sure, good music! If you consider a song like \\"Man Of Our Times\\" like crap, excuse me, but you're not human! The whole album, in my opinion is a gem. I think people have to open their minds and try to appreciate music better. So, if you like real good music, I think you might give this album a try. And for those who continue to bother about the prog transition, yes, this album still have good prog moments, like the three first songs, the masterpiece \\"Man Of Our Times\\", \\"Heathaze\\", the awesome \\"Duke's travels\\" and \\"Duke's End\\". It also have the pop gems, like the hit \\"Turn It On Again\\", \\"Misunderstanding\\", \\"Alone Tonight\\" and other gems. It's really bad that after the release of the good \\"Calling All Stations\\" they decided to end up the band.
B0001Z53CY|4.0|I'll buy anything Eminem does, and this CD is fantastic.  The opening song 'Git Up' is powerful, and 'My Band' is absolutely hilarious.  I am loving the bonus DVD you get with extra footage and the video to 'My Band'.  There is simply no rapper that comes close to Eminem.  His clever lyrics never cease to amaze me, and I am in love with his very strong, distinctive voice.  He only gets better and better with time.  And, oh yeah, D12 is great too.  :)  Sorry to say it, but the song 'My Band' says it all...at least for me.  I bought this CD because it features Eminem.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|I bought it because of the many high rating reviews, tried very hard to like it but in truth I found it too slow and in fact boring, a real waste (...).
1400034779|5.0|I read this book in 2 days, maybe a day and half! :) <BR>I barely know how to describe this book. You settle in, open to the first page, and you just feel warmth surround you. It is the first book I've read in a very long while where I feel the author is a storyteller. I feel as though he has tucked me into bed and is telling me this wonderful story, and I can see the landscapes he describes, and the sweat that drips off of Mma Ramotswe's forehead. It is beautifully written, funny, insightful and just a pleasure to read. I can't wait to start the next one! And the next one!...
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton is back. The macabe genius has slipped up here lately with his re-make of \\"Planet Of The Apes\\", but the man is back and in a big way. Burton has always been able to take his audience on an incredible journey into the minds of oddball characters(Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) and into the presence of magical worlds and fairy tales. Never has he done so with such brilliance as he has with this latest offering. The movie is about Edward Bloom, a man who is seen young(played by Ewan McGregor), and as his older present day self(played by Albert Finney). Edward is not long for this world, and his estranged son Will(Billy Crudup), comes back home with his expecting wife, to see his father and patch things up before it's too late. Will has always been hearing his father's wild tall tales, and has had enough. He wants the truth. He wants to know the man that his father really is before the man himself is no more. From his bed, Edward Sr. talks with his son and the discussion takes us through the life and journeys he has been in. Young Edward is seen as a young man with ambition and determination with a lot left over to spare. He is seen journeying through the world into haunted woods, enchanting towns, working in a traveling circus, and coming across people such as a giant, witches, werewolves, and other interesting characters. Will tries to get to the bottom of these tall tales that his father has been telling and claiming are as true as they can be. It's a son hoping to reconcile with the man, the father, that he never really knew. This is like \\"Forrest Gump\\", but in a way that only Tim Burton could tell it. The story and screenplay is solid and laced with delicate writing, settings, and colorful characterizations. The fact that this wonderful film was so overlooked during 'Awards' time was downright criminal. Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, appears in the film, as does Burton regular, Danny DeVito, who plays a circus ringleader. Jessica Lange plays Edward's wife in present day, Sandra, and that character is played in the past by Alison Lohman. Jessica is such a fine actress, and it's too bad she wasn't given more to do. They did a fine job of getting the two actresses to play the same character. Crudup is a fine young actor and he does a solid job as the confused son searching for answers. Who wouldn't be in his place?. Who would believe the stories, or some of them, would be true?. Every frame is flawlessly choreographed, and the sets and art direction are magical, clear, colorful, and have a very serene feel. This is definitley Burton's masterpiece. It is a film that seems more human than anything he has done. The acting is sincere. Ewan brings an enthusiasm and down home charm to his role as the younger Edward, and he is enigmatic throughout. You are instantly charmed and even though you already know how he turns out, you root for him and wish him the best on his journey in life. Albert Finney does a fine job as the older, ailing Edward. He comes across as a very likeable old man who just embraces life. That's what the film is. Embrace life. Live it to it's fullest. One other review stated that Finney was unpleasant. I find that so untrue. This is pure gold. I haven't been this enchanted with a film in a long time. Thank you Tim Burton. Can't wait for the next one.
0060012234|5.0|Russel Middlebrook is a 16 year old high school sophomore hiding a big secret: he's gay. He keeps a low profile because he doesn't want to be treated like the school outcast and scapegoat Brian Bund upon whom all manner of dirty tricks and teenage cruelties are visited. Instead, Russel spends his time with Gunnar and Min, a guy and girl known for their brains, but who are also \\"occasional visitors to the border region of high school respectability\\" (p. 6).  Russel is not eager to leave that border. Ever.<br />By a fluke Russel learns that another student is also gay, and he embarks upon that universally heady, intense journey where falling in love seems oh-so-right. He joins the baseball team to be with his boyfriend-even hits a home run-and suddenly he's living in the Land of the Popular. But he also meets some other kids who are gay and lonely. They have an inspiration to start a gay/lesbian support group, but in order to keep out those who would mock and exile them, they call it Geography Club. Unfortunately, the secret does not stay confidential, and the fallout is more than Russel thinks he can bear. Will he choose to take the coward's way out? Or can he stand up to the ignorant people all around?<br />With a light touch and a sense of humor, Hartinger tells a very serious story, one that is being played out in high schools across the country. With unerring accuracy, he depicts the isolation and fear first of one young man, then of a small group, and he reveals the courage and support it takes for any gay or lesbian high school student to stand up to the crowd. By the end of this novel, I had tears in my eyes. The story is moving, the characters are classic, and the discoveries Russel makes are ones that both high schoolers and adults should all learn. Highly recommended.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|It's hard to take the music seriously when I doubt that they're even being honest about their sexuality. <BR>Music-wise, it sounds like old-school Britney Spears trying to rock out - horrible on paper, even horribler live (I know that horribler isn't a word, but this stuff is so bad, that it deserves a new word for bad that means ten thousand times worse than CRAP!) Clever idea, trying to capitalize on an industry driven by sex appeal, but little more than that. Even watching them make out on stage gets boring after a while.
1594200106|5.0|I read the spanish edition as soon as it was available. From the first pages, Ruiz-Zafon grabs your attention in such a way that you JUST CANNOT PUT IT DOWN!!  He is able to transport you to Barcelona, the details of the post war lady of the Mediterranean imprints in your mind the horror of a fraticidal war.  The plot, which innocently enough, begins with a father and his child sharing a secret, grows in scope and characters that eventually share a common thread.  AND just when you think you know what is going to happen next, Ruiz-Zafon turns you and your new found world (the novel) upside down!<br />READ IT! READ IT! I will read it Again.  SOON.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|I've never given a second review before, but I forgot something I wanted to mention.<BR>Because Devil's Night, D12's first album, was a commercial failure, I assumed that D12 would step up their game on the second LP. It saddens me, as I am a big Eminem fan, but this wasn't the case (they did get better lyrically, as I said in the first review, but the production seems less than before). <BR>It saddens me also, that upon hearing this album, I've reached a conclusion (I hope I'm wrong, but this is what I think): Eminem has reached a rut. He's hit the creative wall that everyone hits. He reached his peak too early, and now, he's lost it. Proof of this is found in the first single, My Band - his lyrics seem less intelligent and witty, and they don't rhyme in as many places as they have in the past. Plus, there was a time - albeit a short one - in which Eminem could do no wrong when it came to producing and choosing beats. Even Without Me, the first single off of The Eminem Show, was a catchy track, though it was a step down from The Real Slim Shady. My Band is not catchy and fun, it's just annoying. And Eminem doesn't save it with his Andy Kaufman impression at the end (when he's singing about his Salsa - if you've seen Taxi, you know what I mean).<BR>The only things that save this album for me are the Kanye West track, and The Good Die Young, in which Proof produces. I hope I've made my feelings clear.
B00003CXCT|5.0|OK, first off, the original trilogy needed to be brought to DVD, period!  Next off, as far as the special effects in the special edition go, good try, maybe they were shotty at times, but it's infinitely better than watching The Lord of the Rings (any of them) on a Saturday night.  As far as which movie is the best, I can't even say that.  Without one you wouldn't have the other.  After all this, I think it goes without saying, this trilogy is awesome, none better, end of story.
0451169514|5.0|It, by Stephen King as far as i am concerned is a very srong book, the characters are also the most powerful link of the book. The losers club is made up of rejects in the modern life, and this is what makes it so powerful. Definitly not for the weak minded. i couldnt go into any dark areas for a month and now, im stil scared of drains. Stephen King has done it again.<BR>   Although i am for the fact that the characters should not have returned to finish off the evil, it is a wonderful book. A must read.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|i'm sure you've heard about them by now...and yes, all the hype is true. they rock, and you just cant deny it. very catchy, very hyper, very dance-able. buy it, you will love it, you will let your hair down and dance like no one is watching.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This is an excellent (make that very excellent) remake of an old movie.  I sometimes wonder if Lindsay Lohan realizes what a versatile and talented actress she is; she has yet to make a bad movie.  Freaky Friday is no exception to that rule.<br />Now, add Jamie Lee Curtis, and you have entertainment, ten-fold.  The two work really well on screen together, and of course the movie's message is one that never ages; kids think parents have it made, and parents think kids have it made.  This movie, as the old one, demonstrate that neither child nor parent have it made.<br />The acting is good.<br />The storyline moves along well.<br />The supporting actors perform well.<br />The music is good.<br />The DVD contains some nice extras: bloopers, deleted scenes, music videos, and alternate ending.  This is a DVD worth the money!  Buy it, and watch it over and over with the family!<br />See ya next review!<br />[...]
055321277X|2.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a very unique book.  It was hard for me to get interested in it because in the beginning it was kind of confusing.  As th book goes on it pieces itself together and starts making since.  I didn't really enjoy Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde because it wasn't the kind of book I would usually read.  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde would be a great book for people who enjoy science fiction, confusing books, and like jumping from different character's points of view.  I would probably have liked the book more if it didn't jump from the different points of view and different subjects so much.  The part of the bookkk I dislliked the most was the last chapter when Dr. Jekyll was telling the storyy in his point of view.  The best part of the book was in the middle whenn everything started piecing itself together and making since to me.  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was an okay book for me, but I couldn't really get interesssted in it.  If you like to read science fiction yoou should probably take the chance and reaad the book.  I hope that the other people who read this book find it more enjoyable that I did.  Good Luck!!!
B000002C4J|5.0|Celine.<br />The last name is not needed.<br />After purchasing her prior album, I know she would not let me down and I was correct.<br />From her duet with Carole King on &quot;The Reason&quot;, &quot;Immortality&quot; with the Bee Gees and the ahhhh breathless &quot;I hate you, then I love you&quot; with the man himself Mr. LUCIANO PAVAROTTI, Celine's powerful vocals blows you away with every note, every pitch, and every lyric.<br />Be prepared to fall in love with &quot;Immortality&quot;, &quot;Us&quot;, &quot;Love is on the Way&quot;, &quot;Why Oh Why&quot; AND OF COURSE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;My Heart will go on&quot; from Titanic ( which elevated her to SUPER DUPER STAR STATUS OVER NITE).You will see why, the world is a songful place because of her.<br />You wanna git down?<br />Yeah, Celine has been know you get fiesty at times, and boy, can see  S I N G  when she does... (She just an all rounded singer which makes her a great artist). With her uptempo songs like &quot; Treat her like a lady&quot; and &quot;Just a Lil Bit of Love&quot;, you will see why Celine can both throw down and get down. Laters...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the year of 2003 Britney returned to the music scene from her wild year of antics with the infamous MTV kiss with Madonna. In November 2003 Britney released her stunning Cd `In The Zone'. Britney released her best album yet. She transformed herself from a sexy young teenager to a provocative young woman. In the Zone takes listeners though a journey of different styles of music. From Hard hitting dance tracks, to dirty ghetto Hip Hop to viby trance tracks to beautiful peaceful ballads. This album shows Britney at her best. This album made critics label her \\"The New Madonna\\".<br />Me Against The Music - This is the lead single from the album. It is the infamous duet featuring Madonna. It is a hard hitting club dance track any is very different from what is on the radios these days. The track is just about being in a club and being oblivious to everyone and freestyling. I couldn't think of a better way for a come back song. Britney could have released a typical R&B track for her return, but she wanted to be unique. She has definetly succeeded. This is my 2nd Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. 10/10<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom - This track is an Up-tempo Hip Hop track perfect for the clubs. The track has also has an Indian vibe to it. This track features the Ying Yang Twins, which gives the track a dirty ghetto, feel to it. This song is my 3rd Favourite song on the album, and is one of the best Hip Hop songs I have ever heard. 10/10<br />Showdown - The famous UK producers Bloodshy & Avant produced this track. It is a great sexy dance track which features Britney whispering \\"I don't wanna be a tease. Would you undo my zipper please\\" This track is done very well. Again very unique. 9/10<br />Breathe On Me - This song is very club-savvy orientated and is one of the most sensual tracks on the album. The song has a HOT beat and is reminiscent to Kylie's Can't Get You Out Of My Head. This track describes the intensity of a relationshipso hot that they don't even need to touch, just breathe. This is my Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. I can automatically see this song go #1 in Europe if it is released. 10/10<br />Early Mornin - The second this track commences you will automatically know that it is Moby produced. This track is very sexy and has a trance feel to it. The song is very vibey and is about the next morning after a big night out. 8.5/10<br />Toxic - This is the second single from the album which is produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The song is HOT and fits Britney perfectly. The track is a hard hitting dance track which could easily be used as the theme song to Alias or the next bond movie.This is the track responsible for rising her album sales all around the world. Critics are describing it the best song Britney has released since I'm A Slave For You. I love this track so much because of its uniqueness. 10/10<br />Outrageous - This is a typical R&B penned track. The second the song commences you will automatically realise it is R Kelly produced. This song is again perfect for the clubs and has an Indian vibe to it. The chorus is very catchy. 10/10<br />Touch Of My Hard -This is the most sensual song on the album. This song is a beautiful dance ballad reminiscent to Madonna's The Power Of Goodbye & Janet's That's The Way Love Goes.(...) The song is Britney's most mature song to date and has a sexy vibe to it. This is definitely a stand out track on the album. 10/10.<br />The Hook-Up - Redzone, the famous team behind the Britney/Madonna duet, produced this track. This song has an R&B reggae feel to it and is fairly uptempo. This Is what we call a filler track and one of the less memorable on the album. 5/10<br />Shadow - This track is a beautiful ballad produced by The Matrix. This is very reminiscent to Avril's I'm With You. This track shows Britney's vocals at its best. I personally think this is her best ballad since Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know.10/10<br />Brave New Girl - This song brings back the days Britney was innocent. In every album she has to bring out the stupidness in her. She has done exactly that in this track. This track is very pop driven and could be used as the theme song to Legally Blonde. I personally think it is The worst song on the album and one of the worst songs I have ever heard. 1/10 The only reason I give it a 1 is because it is Britney.<br />Every Time - This song is very peaceful and pleasant. It tells the story of heartbreak. The track features a beautiful harmony and goes well with the mood of the sound. She sings in lower key although it fits the song perfectly. Again another brilliant ballad from Britney. 10/10<br />Me Against The Music (Remix) - This is remix to the First Single. The song was remixed by Peter Rishi and an Indian vibe has been added to it. The song is still very clubby and is probably one of the best remixes I have ever heard. 10/10<br />The Answer - This is the Australian bonus track and is produced by P Diddy. The song has an R&B mid tempo flow to it. I really liked this song, but I was disappointed at the same time. When I heard the idea of Britney & P Diddy working together I was expecting an up tempo R&B track, although it was completely the opposite. 9/10<br />Don't Hang Up - This is another Australian bonus track. The song is mid tempo and again has an R&B pop flow to it.This song is about Phone Sex. This song was produced by the same team behind Brave New Girl. I personally don't like this song and think she should never work with Brian & Josh again. 3/10.<br />ALL IN ALL I LOVE THIS CD AND I DON'T THINK IT COULD HAVE GOTTEN ANY BETTER. THIS ALBUM IS VERY UNQIUE AND IS BRITNEY'S BEST ALBUM SO FAR. OVERALL I GIVE IT A 10/10
B000002BHE|5.0|Now, Now, Celine's TRUE Fans know that she has had a string of HITS even before this album, but it was with this album, the world took serious notice.<br />(Although all the songs are great, these are my absolute favs)<br />&quot;Its all coming back to me now&quot; 10/10 - This is the best love song of all time. Remember the video? Very captivating.<br />&quot;Because you love me&quot; From the movie &quot;Up Close and Personnal&quot;  9.5/10 - This is a classic. This is still a hit on the radios, and the lyrics are so timeless, you can't help but sing along to it.<br />&quot; Falling Into You&quot; 11/10 - Yeah, you heard me. This song starts out with these &quot;SICK&quot; tongo drums; kinda reminds me of this exotic goddess of the woods luring in the darkness and dancing infront of her man. AHhhh beautiful....<br />&quot;Make Me Happy&quot; 10/10 - Slightly upbeat, and filed with some &quot;Oh My Goodness&quot;  chords and some &quot;ILL&quot; notes (Musicians, you know what I mean)...that woman can  S A N G...<br />&quot;Seduces me&quot; 11/10 - Um...Self explanatory...NEXT<br />&quot;All By Myself&quot; 12/10 - You wanna hear the beautiful range of Celine, listen to this soft, carefree song in its entire. Such a great remake of a timeless classic.<br />...Ok, so all the songs on this album are just such a KNOCKOUT so I can't rate all of them ( no more space!!!).. One more thing, if this album gets you all teary-eyed and love-sick for more, get Celine's &quot;Lets Talk About Love&quot; as well. C-YA
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I`ve always been a beatlemaniac ever since I was interduced to the fab four by my dad who was born back in 1950 and knows every thing about their incredible hits so I`m insane over buying anything that says beatles on it. When I found out about the beatles 1 cd and the tracks that are on it I just had to comment about it because if your a true beatle fan you just have to buy this cd!! there isn`t one song on it that doesn`t pass my rating of 5 stars!!!!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|I don't mind the comparisons between Interpol and other bands like Joy Division or Echo and the Bunnymen.  I loved those bands in their heydays, and I have been hoping for something to give me that same kind of vibe since the mid-late-80's.  Interpol somewhat fills that musical/emotional void with &quot;Turn On The Bright Lights&quot;.  <br />While there are several cuts on this CD which sound cold, mechanical and repetitive, there are more which I find to be real standouts.  One of these is the album-closer, &quot;Leif Erikson&quot;.  The lyrics on that one just kill me...  they must have been written from a desperate, desolate place during the dark night of the soul.  I'm not sure I've heard such resignation in lyrics since Joy Division's &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;.  Another example is &quot;PDA&quot;.  It fills me with a sense of mystery;  what are they singing about as the gritty, determined rhythm guitars move along?  <br />The atmospheric production throughout the CD makes me think of big places:  warehouses... beaches... deserts... forests... skies.  This is a great disc for traveling.  Try it in your car on a long drive through a sparsely-populated area.  It works!<br />Interpol doesn't use flashy guitar solos;  they don't have to in order to get their point across.  And it may be that their point is to pour their guts out for all to see and hear, with the voice and the instruments mapping out dark and uncharted emotional territories.  Throbbing rhythms, honest vocals and steady guitarwork guide them on their way.<br />While this may not be a perfect CD, it shows us a band with incredible promise.  If you allow yourself into the world Interpol creates with their music, it might touch your soul;  I find some truly transcendent moments here.  It is for this reason I give it a 5-star rating despite imperfections.  <br />This is a good starting place for the band, and for their listeners.  Many thanks to Matador Records for signing this band and releasing their CD!  It will be in my &quot;CD rotation&quot; for a long time to come.
0393057658|5.0|This book is full of both theory and anecdotes. I recommend it not just for serious baseball fans but also marginal fans who don't know much about the nitty-gritty of the game. Yet. It is totally entertaining.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|In the first Matrix, the W brothers took time away from the special effects and action sequences to EXPLAIN what was going on. There was a lot of explaining to do, and they made sure they did it. That's why people loved The Matrix. It was complex but it made sense.<br />In this film, the second sequel to the original, nothing is explained. Nothing makes sense. Characters show up and talk about philosophical concepts, making the plot pointlessly murky. The Oracle is a new woman, but it's not clear why (other than the fact that the original actress died). As the movie goes on, you find yourself collecting questions. Why is THAT happening? Why did they go THERE? Entire scenes have nothing to do with the plot. (Just try to figure out why the Merovingian is back. There's no explanation.)<br />Rather than clear things up, you get one of the most overblown action sequences in the history of film. And it's boring. Yes, the special effects are impressive, but they seem too computerized (or stolen from other sci-fi movies) to hold your attention. In the documentary on the second disc, the filmmakers show how most of these effects were created with models, not on a computer. How could the models look so fake? It's an amazing feat to turn something real into something that seems artificial.<br />I highly recommend avoiding this movie. It's simply a crude, thoughtless cash-in on the popularity of the first film. This movie (and Reloaded) will go down in history as the two worst sequels ever. The difference in quality between the first film and these sequels is so great, you can't help but wonder: What happened?
B0001BKAEE|1.0|NOTE: I saw an edited version of this film, with swear words, sex scenes, nudity, and very graphic violence deleted. I can't vouch for the content of the unedited film, and as a Christian I would advise looking into it before viewing this movie. Also, this review will spoil the plot for those who haven't seen the movie yet.<br />  2003 seemed to be the year of third installments. We had Return of the King, T3, and then the Matrix Revolutions-at least. I haven't followed every movie out there, so there may have been even more.<br />  So how does Revolutions measure up? After only one viewing I can tell you-it didn't. Which is to say-it was really, really bad. Not only was it one of the most unsatisfactory ends to a trilogy that I have seen, but it was just one of the more poorly made, stupid, and pretentious films in my experience-exceeded only by a couple of other bombshells my family and I walked in to without knowing their lack of worth.<br />  What made it so bad? It wasn't the plot. It had its faults-most plots have some-but better directors could have done more with it. A sketchy form of it is as follows.<br />  The human city of Zion is within twenty hours of being attacked by a quarter million sentinels, the machines' most ubiquitous `soldiers'. The citizens prepare for an attack, and it comes in due course. The humans get the worst of it until one of their own hovercraft gains a temporary reprieve by setting off its Electro-Magnetic Pulse, a weapon that disables all the machines in its blast radius. But the machines aren't about to give up, and the humans know it's only a matter of time before they are attacked again.<br />  Meanwhile, Neo has had some sort of vision or other that he is supposed to go to the machine city. Several people tell him it's suicide to go there, but one of the hovercraft captains who believes in him gives him a ship, and he and Trinity leave. Neo is confronted on the ship by another incarnation of his old nemesis, Agent Smith-but this time Smith has copied himself into someone in the real world. Smith ends up blinding Neo with some laser gun or electric instrument, but the man he copied himself into dies in the encounter.<br />  Somehow Neo can still see, although everything appears to him as orange flame. They reach their destination, where Trinity is killed after their hovercraft crashes. Neo continues his quest despite his grief, and after a talk with the Source, where he makes a deal that, if he defeats Smith, the Source will call off the attack on Zion, he is plugged into the Matrix, where he has a final confrontation with Smith.<br />  A plot like this could have been worked with-although all the stuff about the Source was lame-but the Wachowski Brothers seem bent on making this movie bad.<br />  One of the primary concerns of a movie is acting-a movie is a group of people pretending to be what they are not, caught on camera. Nobody should think of them as true, and no ordinary film maker tries to do so. But a level of realism should be attempted which Revolutions does not achieve. With the exception of Hugo Weaving, who gives a refreshingly professional performance as Agent Smith, and the actor playing the man Smith has `inhabited' in the real world, the rest of the acting is wooden and unconvincing. Keanu Reeves was never any great shakes on the acting score. If he just keeps his mouth shut and fights, he's O.K., and his one-liners are at least indifferent, but when he is forced to handle anything longer, he starts to break down. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is even worse. Her predictably wooden lines are laughable. One has to wonder...did she go to acting school?<br />  Another thing this movie misses is the masculinity of Morpheus in the original Matrix film. Here he is little more than a leather jacket with a pretentious voice, who isn't much of a leader at all any more, at least in the real world. Trinity, who looked up to him before, seems to just ignore him.<br />  Now as to the philosophy of this film. It is even more ridiculous than the acting. Most of it are labyrinthine phrases that are virtually, if not completely, meaningless. Perhaps their intricacies make them sound deep, but this is nothing more than a gaudy chest with promises of treasure on the outside, which, when opened, is empty. No peace, no security, no meaning can be found in the philosophy of Revolutions. The veiled allusion to the crucifixion, when Agent Smith copies himself into Neo and then is destroyed afterwards, when checked against the Wachowski brother's previous record, is blasphemous, not laudable. Nothing Christian here at all-or if it is intended to be, it is the form of Christianity only and not the real thing. There would have been vastly more fruit here if the Wachowski's were Christians.<br />  Even the action scenes get a bit old by the third installment. The new stunts introduced in an attempt to make it innovative were sometimes rather silly-for example, the men of the Frenchman Merovingian have the ability to walk upside-down on walls. Maybe in some movies it could have been effective, but not in this one. Neo and Agent Smith both have acquired the ability to fly-and once again, in some other films this can be effective. Even a movie like Superman, with much inferior special effects, seems to use this better. Perhaps this is merely my bias against the bad parts of this film-which constitutes pretty much everything-but I'm not sure. I'm not going to see it again to find out.<br />  It does seem a good question: \\"Why, why, Mr. Anderson, why get up?\\" Why indeed? He might have done better just to stay in the mud.R>     Now as to the philosophy of this film. It is even more ridiculous than the acting.

0393317552|4.0|This book is the beginning of a long and necessary effort to answer the question: Why did Spaniards destroy and/or enslave people in South America --- and not the other way around? It makes sense to generalize and ask, Why did ANY particular group of people consistently dominate another in history?<br />There has already been a lot of research into this topic that centered around intelligence: The Spaniards were smarter, that's why they dominated. But Jared Diamond rejects this conclusion immediately. Based on his experience, he doesn't think the colonizers have bigger or better brains, or higher IQs. So he goes looking for a materialist explanation, searching for the way that climate, crops, and animal domestication led to better immune systems and superior technology.<br />This theoretical stuff isn't a large part of the book. Diamond makes his case briefly and then spends 90% of the book on facts to back it up. And the facts are impressive. Diamond knows a lot about agriculture and animal domestication. He writes about it clearly. The information is important and interesting, which makes the bulk of the book very easy to read.<br />But does he prove his case? Well, obviously you'll have to decide for yourself. Personally, I think he came to his conclusions too quickly. The evidence is very good, but it's simply not enough. That leads me back to the beginning of this review --- this book is the START of a long research project, not the end. Reading this book is very easy, and it's likely to inspire you to read more on the topic. Jared Diamond might not convince you 100% that materialistic factors decided who dominated who, but you can't help but be impressed with the amount of information he's collected to back up his theory. My guess is that the IQ approach will wither away as this book begins to dominate the debate.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I was a huge fan of the first movie.  The second came along and although I wasn't thrilled with it, I found it watchable.  This final episode in the triligy was too awful to describe.....Boring, trite, utterly uncreative, it was a total waste.  Pass on this one.  You won't be missing anything.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This was acually the lowest selling roth era album, but many VH fans say it is by far their favorite.  This album is more dominated by eddie and not dave (Women and Children &amp; Diver Down)  It is the heaviest and darkest VH album.  The later albums were much more pop oriented.  If Van Halen ever got to be a heavy metal band, this was the closest they got.  IT'S A TRUE GEM
B000148KK2|5.0|One of the notable pleasures of great artists is enjoying their creative development.  Diana Krall's previous work can be very much enjoyed without insisting that new performances simply repeat what has gone before.  I disagree strongly with the reviewer from Nashville, TN who claims that the nays have it.  If one does not insist on hearing with preset expectations, one will find this new collection both delightful and truly rewarding.  From pieces in more familiar style like Temptation and Love me Like a Man to new territory such as Narrow Daylight, I'm Coming Through, and the remarkable Departure Bay, this offering is worth both appreciation and many listenings.  Singing and at the piano, Krall is wonderful.  The ensemble playing could not be better.  Jazz has always combined the capacities for deep appreciation of the past and openness to new directions.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Out of all the albums that DLR was singing for VH, this is by far the best.  Any roth era album is killer, but this one is a standout!!  It's a must have for any TRUE Van Halen fan
B00008S2VG|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST MADONNA ALBUM, ABSOLUTELLY THE BEST, IT CANT BE COMPARED TO PREVIOUS CHEESY RECORDS LIKE LIKE A VIRGIN AND WHOS THAT GIRL, ITS JUST PERFECT AND AS POETIC AND FRESH AS MUSIC AND RAY OF LIGHT AND BEDTIME STORIES BUT MUCH MUCH BETTER!!!
B000002H72|5.0|give this album a few listen-throughs and you'll know why they're one of the best bands ever.  their influence on nirvana, weezer, everyone is incredibly obvious after you've obsessed over this one for a minute or two.
0380002930|5.0|I had this book sitting on my shelf for years and steered clear of it because it was a 'book about rabbits'.  I just finished reading it with my 12 year old son and we both adored it.  It is realistic, suspenseful and at times funny.  I know both of us will read it over and over.  I just ordered the DVD as well.
0767827902|3.0|An amazing movie. Frankly, I agree with the glowing reviews of the film and I have nothing to add to them. However, concerning the quality of the restoration to DVD I must say that it appears that the widescreen formatting was done incorrectly. If you compare the image of the film's opening with that in the documentary(disregarding the full frame), you will notice that the area below the steps of the moviehouse, in the documentary, reveals the begining of the street. In the film itself, this has been cut off. You can also compare the image of Cybill Shepherd on the back of the DVD cover that shows her feet as she steps out of her car. In the film, this is also cut off.
B00000JCOV|1.0|You know, I'm not very fond of the state of the world right now, but I don't throw trite little temper tantrums like Slipknot does. I mean really, there are people out there that suck and yes, we've all felt depressed, but I've never once felt the desire to write a bad diary entry about killing everyone. And that's what this album is. A dismal, inane, angsty mess wrapped-up in a blanket of fake death metal.<BR>I mean, I'm all for songs about emotional strife, but I prefer something a little more mature or challenging. Serious, powerful music this is not. Come on, if you want extreme metal, you may as well buy a Napalm Death record. Want noise? Listen to The Boredoms, early Sonic Youth, or Lightning Bolt. Slipknot is one of those bands that might be appealing in those angsty teenage years (I don't really see how though), but really, it's quite ridiculous. Trust me, this is stuff you'll grow out of. If gimmicky, \\"please look at how shocking we are\\" nonsense if your cup of tea, dive right in.
055321277X|4.0|This controversial novel, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, shows the battle between the supernatural and rational thought. In this story Dr. Jekyll, a deranged scientist, creates a potion that separates his body into two people, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  This controversial theory of the body being divided into good and evil is clearly depicted in Stevenson's work.  Many people would dispute the worth of this novel due to the fact the story is widely read and depicted as clearly as Stevenson has wrote.  I truly enjoyed the true story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, showing the true reasons Dr. Jekyll had for his transformation.
B00006IU73|5.0|Brillant.<br />If you're a fan on 70s progressive rock (Genesis, Yes, Pink Floyd) this is a must have.  I have almost all their studio albums and this one is my favorite.  The other ones are great as well, but this one is the pinnacle of the genere or at least the modern incarnation.  It's far better than anything Radiohead has done.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JN02|5.0|Wolfgang Becker's \\"Goodbye Leinin!\\" was a phenomenon is Germany, packing theaters and sweeping the 2003 European Film Awards in Berlin.  In light of that success, it was disappointing to have to wait well over a year for it to arrive in U.S. theaters.<br />The U.S. trailer depicts a goofy comedy, but this is actually a touching movie about one family in the former East Germany struggling through the changes brought on in 1989 by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the DDR state.  In addition, it's a great little history lesson - there are great intermingled clips of East German leaders Erich Honecker, Egon Krenz and of other leaders like Mikhail Gorbachev and Helmut Kohl.  Footage of \\"Ossies\\" stampeding into friendly Embassies right before the Wall tumbles are turned inside-out and artfully presented as Westerners clamoring to get into the \\"socialist paradise.\\"<br />Even though this is Daniel Bruehl's movie (as the lead character 'Alex,' he appears in everyone of the scenes), it's his comic foil (and new 'Wessie' pal) Denis (as wonderfully played by Florian Lukas) who stands out.  Whether it's his unbridled delight at sneaking his low-budget '2001' homage into a wedding video, or his portrayal as a spot-on, faux East German network newsreader, Lukas' brand of humor is one that transcends any language gap.  He must have had them howling in the theaters in Germany.<br />To get a real sense of the German experience since 1989, I highly recommend you catch 'Goodbye Lenin' while it's still in theaters.
0780020685|5.0|I've loved this movie since the first time i saw it. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie - Action, great acting, Romance, and a cast of characters that you will be absolutely captivated with. The directors excellent choices of landscapes and beautiful scenery as well as his excellent sense of timing and mood in weather. You can't go wrong with this movie. It is the greatest movie ever made in IMHO. If you are a movie collector you MUST have this movie
B00018D44U|1.0|I loved the first CD so much, that I couldn't wait for this one.  It was an absolute disappointment.  It will be difficult for her to recover from this fiasco.
0743454529|5.0|This book was very much a page turner. It takes you through all the thoughts of each character, as if they've wrote them themselves. My favorite book so far. It made me laugh and cry and the ending is a shock! Wow!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Well, what we have now is this guy called &quot;West.&quot;  Although, Kayne has yet to reach the status of Tribe - he has the elements to be in that prestigous class of Hip-Hop artists.  His producing skillz are definitely changing the game but it's unknown if his rhyming skillz will ever do the same.<br />Nevertheless, his music has the depth that so much Hip-Hop lacks these days.  If you like ODB, Juvinelle, and Too-$hort - you're sure to hate this CD :) If you like Mos Def, Roots, Tribe, De La - you're sure to like this CD.
B00005ONMO|5.0|I'm often amused by the fatuous pretentions of university wits and would-be conservatory aesthetes who see fit to weigh empty claims over one of the more controversial conductors in recent memory. Sinopoli is a titanic presence on these recordings, which hold one's attention rapt over the full 17+ hours of these shimmering, bold, and brilliant interpretations. His legacy is replete with unique achievements, and this Mahler set ranks among the best. Few in the throes of armchair fetishism realize that this resurgimiento of Mahler commenced forty years ago, largely thanks to Lenny and the NYP. Yes, not every conductor embraces all ten symphonies of Mahler, but not every conductor has the formidable quality of a sustained attention span.<br />While the 7th, 8th, 9th, and Das Lied Von der Erde are definitive, I would have to call attention to the meticulous and exquisite reading of the 3rd, especially the closing Langsam section, which stands up easily to Zander and Bernstein. The excerpted, unfinished 10th is similarly exalted, and the 2nd is overwhelming, superior even to Kaplan. <br />The Kubelik import box is an equally forceful document--I can't comment on the domestic release issue as my copy of Sinopoli, like the Kubelik, was made in Germany.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I have never been much of a fan of Neil Young, especially with Crazy Horse.  Countless friends have tried to convert me over the years, but it just never happened.  But when I heard Greendale a few months back, I immediately fell in love with it.  The songwriting is amazing and the sound itself is just so relaxed and simple.  The entire album is great, not one low point on it.  I highly recommend this to everyone, especially if you never cared for Neil before.
0345440900|1.0|This book is one amazingly bad piece of parenting advice after another. The author pays lip service to loving guidance and breastfeeding, and yet page after page involves reasons not to do either.<br />Written by a nanny who abandoned her children (if you don't believe it, do a search on the 'net - it's all verifiable), this is a classic approach to how to make dysfunction a part of every home.
0385336810|5.0|....with the newest character that Ms. Kinsella has created.  Emma Corrigan is a lowly marketing secretary; she shares a flat with the brilliant but naive Lissy, who is her best friend, and Jemima, a designer-clad dodo whose entire life is geared towards getting a &quot;rock&quot; on her finger.  Emma's life is blah; she is dating the handsome but dull Connor (who secretly reminds her of Ken, of Barbie and Ken fame) with whom she secretly has nothing in common.  Her lack of career/personal success is magnified by cousin Kerry's (who lived with the Corrigans throughout her childhood and is like a second daughter to Emma's parents)  entrepenurial/marital achievements. Then she encounters a stranger on an tumultuous plane ride to whom she divulges all of her biggest secrets (she secretly only pretends to like jazz, since Connor loves it, she is really NOT a size 4, and G-strings hurt).  When the plane lands safely after all, Emma breathes a sigh of relief and thinks that is the end of it.  Until she shows up at her job at the Panther Corporation and discovers that the &quot;stranger&quot; on the plane is actually one of the company's founding fathers...and Emma's life is soon thrown into complete chaos...!!<br />Fans of Becky Bloomwood from Kinsella's &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series will find the secretive Emma Corrigan equally adorable.  Dare we hope that this is the start of yet another fabulous series?!?<br />DYB
0385512104|5.0|I found Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time an amazing read.  The author's writing skillfully conveys the frustrations and concerns of the protagonist, an autistic teenager, with his world and those of his caregivers with him.  This is done while maintaining the protagonist's point of view and addressing the general themes of trust and safety.<br />I am a special educator, and, as I read this book, I am reminded of students, past and present, with whom I have worked and work.   Their seemingly pointless rituals and behaviors are just as important to them as my morning cup of coffee is to me.  They are able to make sense of and feel safe with the world around them by providing it with a structure.  The protagonist of the book, Christopher Boone, does this by using his abilities, perceptions, and logic.  While using Christopher's words to describe his world and responses to it, the author provides the reader with insight and empathy for the people--including Christopher--in that world.  I strongly recommend this book to people working with those who have \\"special needs.\\"<br />The author also addresses the universal needs of trust and safety.  What happens when trust is loss and feelings of safety, so related to trust, shattered?  How are these restored when they are destroyed?  Christopher's responses to these losses may be unorthodox, but they are human.  The behaviors of those around Christopher are also human.  This story is an empathetic portrayal of a human situation.  It is, in short, a book to read.
B000002OX7|5.0|Nineteen seventy-one was without a doubt a milestone year for rock and roll. The Rolling Stones indulged themselves in the heyday of their decadent blues rock on \\"Sticky Fingers\\", Led Zeppelin delivered their epic masterpiece \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" and, of course, The Who gave their rivals a run for their money with \\"Who's Next\\". Born out of the shattered, larger-than-life ambitions of Pete Townshend's \\"Lifehouse\\" project, which collapsed under its own enormous weight,  \\"Who's Next\\" is where the band wisely decided to cut back their rock opera excesses and let the songs speak for themselves. <br />          The resulting album is simply The Who at their very best. Almost every song could function as a single. From the shimmering keyboards on \\"Baba O'Riley\\" - showcasing the band's willingness to expand their musical vision, as well as Townshend's fascination with electronic minimalism of Terry Riley and Steve Reich - to \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", an earnest ballad (which is The Who's own mini version of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" of sorts) that builds up from minor chord arpeggios, modulates into a cathartic climax with crushing guitars and breaking rhythm before returning to the keynote, the band never sounded so exuberant. Other notable tracks are \\"Bargain\\", a straight-up hard rock number and the band's most recognizable hit, \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\"; an entity onto itself filled with synthesizers, Townshend's signature spinning \\"windmill\\" chords, Moon's manic drumming and Daltrey's vocals in top form. <br />          Many albums get undeserved \\"legend\\" labels but \\"Who's Next\\" more than lives up to it. If there is any doubt about its status as one the pinnacles of classic rock, just listen to about two minutes into the opening track - as Pete Townshend cries  \\"it's only teenage wasteland\\" and Keith Moon unleashes savage fury on drums - and you'll know what the legend was all about. A masterpiece.
0345440900|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, after my two-week old infant girl was spending most of her daytime hours awake, and getting very-overtired (her eyes looked like match sticks were holding them open), and nothing would settle her to sleep except rocking or singing.  Then she would always wake up crying again after a short nap.  A few days of this (one day she barely slept in 12 hours!), and I was pulling my hair out.  This book may not have all the answers, but it completely changed our house in a few days.  I learned how to read her cues BEFORE she was too tired, and to calm her so was ready and able to accept sleep, in her own crib, so I could actually put her down and take a shower while she slept.  This was a lifesaver for me.  Now, at four weeks, we're still learning, and I will be reading more books, as she still occasionally needs up to half an hour of help before falling asleep for a nap, but at least she always naps for 2-3 good long naps a day (a few hours each), and she even wakes up smiling instead of cranky all the time.  Sometimes now I can even just put her in her crib and walk out, and when I check back in, she's asleep.  No crying at all!  It's so much easier to appreciate your beautiful baby when you see a smile and some nice nap time.  <br />This book gave us some immediate specific strategies, and taught us how to keep a little log of her feed and eat times, so we could figure out what she was doing.  It was extremely helpful in our case, and I would recommend it to any other mothers who have &quot;fussy&quot; babies (our doctor called it colic, but she's so easily soothed now that I think she just gets overstimulated and overtired easily).  Perhaps once you already know how to recognize the different cries and states of your infant, then this book isn't as necessary.  It was perfect for me, and we're now ready to read some of the other books and keep learning, as I do get a bit tired of the strategy of going it to settle her every time she cries now.  Anyway, it worked wonders for us this month.  Thank you Tracy!
B00005YW4H|2.0|I wouldn't say this album is particularly dissapointing unless of course you had very high expectations due to unrealistic promotion by the music business claiming she's the next big thing; in which case you probably deserved to get ripped off anyway. No, my low rating is not due to lack of quality - it's more the lack of soul; soul being an intangible thing which you cannot mimmick - sorry Norah. Due to this lack of soul I keep dozing off halfway through track 5 - the furthermost point I have got in the album. She's sort of mastered the technicalities of her art but not given enough of her soul; maybe she needs to slum it for a while.
B0001ENYKS|2.0|1 good song (Take Me Out) does not a great band make!<BR>And by the way what the hell is a homoerotic dance punk bliss anyway? This is the kind of band you'd have at your prom back in the 80's. Of course since most of today's music is so bad it's not even funny, you get press hyping glorified bums like FF beyond belief. I heard people in subways play better.
B000002LCX|4.0|As you so often find on Amazon, the reviews tumble down one side or the other. Some proclaim this to be the Smiths best and can't understand why others were disappointed. Others consider it a sad, pale effort at self-imitation. Well please allow arrogant me to set you straight, for I am \\"someone with a big nose who knows\\".  Smiths' best? I don't think so. The album lacks the creativity and spark of earlier efforts. However the real crime to most fans is the extreme amount of production polish that was applied here. The Smiths were admired for their ability to craft witty, beautiful music that somehow remained raw and jagged. Also there is some truth that Morrissey seems to be doing more than a little bit of self parody. Occasionally it seems as if he took lyrics from past songs and played a game of Jumble just mixing up the order of the words.  Still let's not pile on too much. By any fair standard this is certainly a very good album. The first 2 tracks are up-tempo, jaunts similar to past songs except that they worked keys and horns into the mix. \\"Death of a Disco Dancer\\" is a slow number that some could view as the boys just going through the motions; the band is so minimal here that to me this felt like the first Morrissey solo song. I fail to understand any criticism of \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\", one of the most ironically upbeat tunes in pop history. The playful, bouncey melody betrayed the vocals \\"I know it's serious.\\" The late 80's MTV success of this video was hilarious because by the time they flashed the info on the screen to introduce the video (Band Name, Song Title, etc.) they were immediately flashing it up again to remind you what you had seen - the gap between intro and extro was seriously maybe 30 seconds. \\"Stop Me...\\" is a brilliant hit that would have been the perfect evolution in the Smiths-pop style had they continued. \\"Stop Me...\\" also presents some of the strongest lyrical content on the album with likely the fastest flow you've ever heard from Morrissey. Marr has rarely sounded crisper.  OK that's halfway through the CD (listen I just needed a paragraph break somewhere). Some have discounted \\"Last Night I Dreamt...\\" as excessive bombast, but that's unfair. This is an epic piece of artfully presented melancholy. \\"Last night I dreamt that somebody loved me. No hope, no harm, just another false alarm.\\" Sure it's more self-pitying than your least favorite Goth song, but it's also hopelessly romantic, beautifully sung and when you heard this as a teenager it was true to your life. Well you're older now and you're a clever swine, but screw you if you don't like this one. \\"Unhappy Birthday\\" is Steven at his most cynical but it's also pretty funny; Marr sparkles on this. \\"Paint a Vulgar Picture\\" is an attack on the music industry in general but specifically a story about their knack for cashing in on the death of a star... think Tupac... no wait 2-Pac. Strangely it is also somewhat hypocritical. To wit.. \\"reissue, repackage... extra track and a tacky badge\\". Hasn't Morrissey done this about 10 different times by now (with his own music and the Smiths legacy)? \\"Death at One's Elbow\\" is simply the worst Smiths' song ever written. There is no reason they should have written this. The album ends with the lovely \\"I Won't Share You\\". Was this Morrissey speaking about his art? \\"I won't share you... with the drive and ambition, the zeal I feel, this is my time.\\" Hmm, the final song on the final Smiths album. Coincidence?
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls was a long time coming.  A quirky, smart, sensitive show that anyone can watch.  The show is about a single mom, Lorelai who at the tender age of sixteen gave birth to Rory(Lorelai)Gilmore.  Against her rich parents wishes she chooses to raise Rory alone and not marry her boyfriend Christopher.  Fast forward sixteen years later, Rory is sixteen and incredibly well adjusted and Lorelai runs the local inn. Rory gets accepted to the Chilton School and Lorelai can't afford the tuition, so she must submit to her parent's wishes and share her life with them again after years of estrangement.  The small town of Stars Hollow, houses many quirky characters, Luke, the local owner of the diner and holds a torch for Lorelai.  Miss Patty, the dance teacher. Sookie, Lorelai's klutzy best friend and chef at the inn.  Lane, Rory's best friend and the daughter of healthy religious mother who secretly wishes to rebel.  Then there's Dean, Rory's first love who works at the local Doosey's market. (In my opinon he's almost too perfect.)  Then there's Paris, Rory's nemisis at school, but really isn't as lethal as she seems.  The first season contains some great story arcs, including the return of Rory's father and the relationship between Lorelai and Rory's teacher Max.  My favorite episode is Rory's Dance when Rory and Dean accidently fall asleep in the dance studio and the wrong idea is assumed dragging up all the old fears and feelings for Lorelai.  This is a truly great show and it should get some Emmy recognition. Combining snappy dialogue and good storytelling, Gilmore Girls is a show everyone should watch and the dvd everyone should own.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|i love this movie, it is such a mind trip. every time i watch it i see something new something that changes my opinion about whats going on. even after the 1000th time (no im not exadurating that) it is still cool to see how the charachters lives twist and intertwine with each other. i would reccomend this to anyone at all.
0330485385|3.0|I found the book to be quite good. It starts well, and improves halfway through, and then suddenly deflates. It leaves the reader wanting more. It's like taking you up a mountain, the scenic route, to the top. It's beautiful all the way up there. But as soon as you're up there, you look down and it is empty. You get dizzy and you feel like the whole trip amounted to naught.<BR>The last quarter was disappointing.

B0001Z53CY|3.0|D12 - D12 World (Shady, 2004)<br />Right off the bat, the beats are better on here, which is more than I can say for their last album, Devil's Night. Eminem doesn't rap much on here and it's a good thing because (1) it gives his group more chance to shine and (2) his delivery is the same in every song he's in. I used to like him for switching up his style every so often but he doesn't even do that anymore. All I'm left to do now is check out his lyrics, which are still on point but I think that Eminem's starting to wear out. He shines, though, on &quot;How Come&quot; and the lead single, &quot;My Band&quot;. <br />Speaking of that track, the chorus goes, &quot;These chicks don't even know the name of my band.&quot; It's not that they don't know the name of it, it's the fact that we can't tell the difference between any of the other members. It's been three years and two albums and I still can't tell who's who in the group. All I know is who's the leader (Eminem) and who's the wack one (Bizarre--I can't BELIEVE I initially thought of him as a great rapper). And the only way I remember Proof is from his underground Promatic album. If you take a look at Wu-Tang Clan, each member has their own individuality. The members of D12 don't, at least it can't be seen yet. You also have to look at it from a solo rapper's perspective: he has to prove that he's different from every other rapper out there in the game, and that is what each member of this group should do.<br />Unlike their last album though, there are some listenable and actually good songs like &quot;B***h&quot; and &quot;Loyalty&quot;, and the group doesn't resort to shock rap as much this time around (except for Bizarre; please get rid of Bizarre). Actually, Em, just get rid of everyone, keep Proof and bring in Obie Trice (who shines on &quot;Loyalty&quot;). This album is definitely better than their first, but in the end, that's still not saying much. -EJR
0425170349|5.0|This book was basically about an anti-terrorist group in England that were all recruited because they are the best of the best. This group works hard to get to the best they can be and there skill are put to the test when a terrorist hires other terrorist gropus to take hostages at various parts of the world. In the meantime the same terrorist is creating a deadly disease and testing this disease on random homeless people they find on the street. <BR> The good points of this book is the action and close inspection to detail. The details in this story are really accurate and you can tell that the writer researched his information well. Another point that is good is his style of writing. You aren't just reading from the perspective of the anti-terrorist group or from the terrorists, you get a view from both sides.<BR> Some points that I didn't really like is how it gets confusing at some points. I read this book before and I didn't understand some of the things because its very military. But after enlisting into the military and learned a lot I read this again and I understood it a lot better. <BR> I would recommend this book to anyone that is into action books or military books. It is a good read and it will keep you entertained the whole time you read it. Although some points of the story are confusing the book is generally an easy read.<BR>Kevin Adams
0671004107|5.0|I would never have guessed that Sagan, a hardheaded, agnostic, scientific type would have in him a book with such a fine sense of character development and emotional pitch. Having read many of his nonfiction books, I was not surprised by the social and religious commentary, which I found to be both perceptive and very even-handed.<br />The science was interesting -- particularly the mode of travel described -- and I found the use of messages buried in irrational numbers to be an imaginative concept that I've never seen before. As a sci-fi story, I would compare this favorably with some of Arthur C. Clarke's best work, including &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous With Rama,&quot; in terms of the scope and majesty of the universe he creates.<br />My only problem with the story, in fact, is that it is a little bit too derivative of Clarke; the space/dimensional traveling sequence seems to be imitative of &quot;2001,&quot; and there are other similarities to Clarke novels, such as &quot;Childhood's End,&quot; that were a little distracting (that's why, on a scale of 1-10, Contact would get a 9, rather than the full 10 rating). Nonetheless, I found this a very moving story that has more genuine feeling in it than almost any S-F story I've read.<br />This is a novel that is visionary and almost religious in its awe of the universe -- the movie was also enjoyable, but as is almost always the case, it can't capture the numinous feeling that the book has, despite a great performance from Jodie Foster.<br />Don't let some of the religious nuts' reactions scare you away from this book -- it has more genuine spirituality in it than a whole room full of Baptists and 700 Club members.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I just loved it!<BR>I loved the movie, i loved the soundtrack. Especially the duduk that was played in the soundtrack. I belive it is an ancient musical instrument from Azerbaijan.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|a slightly confusing, but overall very entertaining and fascinating film. the cast is pretty good, although drew barrymore is absolutely appalling and not quite believable as a high school teacher. <BR>amusing conversations, interesting plot and overall weirdness make this an almost-excellent-but-not-quite movie.
0800177363|5.0|Robert De Niro and Robin Williams both did a great job in this movie.  Robin Williams plays the role of a doctor, a very shy doctor at that!  De Niro plays a patient with sleeping sickness who hasnt said a word or done anything on his own is 30 years.<br />Robin Williams dedicates his time to finding a cure or at least something to help these patients like somewhat of a normal life.  I dont want to ruin the movie for those who havent seen it some Im gonna stop there.<br />But Robert De Niro does an excellent job with his role in this movie.  He his famous for his roles in The Godfather Part II, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, Heat, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Untouchables, and Casino.  In all of these movies he plays either a gangster or a bad@$$ of some sort.  So seeing this movie really shows the acting ability that he has.<br />I dont usually watch movies like this but I had De Niro in it so I had to watch it.  And coming from someone who loves Gangster Movies; this is one of Robert De Niro's best performances and I recommend this movie to everyone, this is a must see!!!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|How's that?  The title covers everything I felt when I saw this film.  Yes, there are too many storylines.  Yes, the &quot;porn stand-ins in love&quot; story was tacky (not to mention the Brit going to get laid in the USA).  Yes, Richard Curtis doesn't allow us to get to know the characters enough. BUT I know I saw myself in at least one of those stories, and I'll bet most everyone else will, too.  <br />Perhaps Curtis didn't want us to get to know those characters too well, since it would allow us to separate ourselves a little too much from those we identified with.  Using little more depth than merely sketching in some of the characters, we the viewers are able to recall ourselves in those similar situations.  I found myself thinking more about the characters in the film long after it was over than I did when I was watching it for the first time.  <br />Now, I doubt Curtis intended to be too terribly &quot;deep&quot; with this film, but like an onion, there are a lot of layers to peel off if one chooses to look at it that way.  <br />I went to see &quot;Love Actually&quot; to see Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson as husband and wife.  The two of them did such a superb job of it that the &quot;ho-hummness&quot; of their marriage was actually quite riveting.  Theirs was without question the most interesting of all the stories -- and the most real.  Their story alone makes &quot;Love Actually&quot; worth viewing.  I don't think you'll regret seeing it at least once, and I believe you'll find yourself drawn to seeing it a few more times to unpeel those layers.<br />Oh, and remember, onions sometimes make you cry....
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Not being a huge fan of Broadway, and musicals, I am often very picky about the musicals I enjoy, but I have absolutely been sucked in by this amazing, enjoyable score and cast. I think that Kristen Chenowith, was the cutest and most addictive witch I've ever herd in my life, and although I've herd small bites, I would never have expected such power and force from Idina Menzel. This is the first I've really herd her, but hopefully won't be the last.  Norbert Leo Butz, one of my favorite male singers, who I loved in The Last 5 Years, was great, I only wished we herd him more. But, I felt the story and it's ironic twists were just hilarious and entoxicating. Overall I give it 5 stars and would recommend that everyone not only get the soundtrack, but get to NYC and see it NOW!
B0000VAFO0|1.0|this movie was laughable at best.  no one paid attention to any of the rules of vampires, except that they drink blood.  none of the vampires were superhuman (the main character passed out after losing a little blood).  the special effects were terrible.  the only ability that the vampires had was jumping in slow motion.  in one scene, a vampire actually looked at herself in the mirror, in the mirror!  last i heard, vampires don't have reflections.  like i said, laughable.  i agree that the guns added to this horror-of-a-movie.  the &quot;lycans&quot; were ok, but that was only because the vampires were so weak.  don't waste your time or your money.  people should be ashamed that a movie like this was actually made.

6305633177|5.0|i got into metallica when i was a teen in the early 90s. back then, the black album had just come out... late 91. the first real experience i had with the band was with kill em all, a metal friend lent it to me. in this time i was a &quot;hard rocker&quot; i.e van halen, guns n roses, etc. the first thing i heard of metallica was enter sandman, in this same time smells like teen spirit by nirvana was around. the mystery of metallica intrigued me... and so i went to kill em all. later ride the lightning, master, and so forth. metallica changed me into a &quot;metal kid&quot;. they were not my favorite band, my &quot;second&quot;, but i gotta give em credit for the great musical influence &amp; change that ocurred in those years. i remember in those early days hanging out at a friend's house, the same guy who lent me kill em all, and watching cliff em all when it was extremely rare, on vhs... dvds did not exist. now my point.<BR>i stopped liking metal around the time metallica came out with load. nontheless, as a person who greatly respected one of the best rock bands of my time, i was dissapointed with them after black. to all newbie metallica fans out there(post-black fans),<BR>i dont blame them for their mainstream route... they turned older and tasted fame. i understand it. but my point is simple, to all these new kids digging on present-day metallica and the whole plascticized new-metal scene, i got this to say: if you consider yourself a true lover of meatllica, tune in to cliff em all. check out the band when they were REALLY metallica, when metal was newborn and innovavtive... music that helped changed the world of rock into what it is today. to REAL metallica fans, study your past!! thats what i got to say. peace
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie was very entertaining. I loved every minute of it and can watch it over &amp; over again. In my opinion, this is Quentin Tarantino's best film. The action is great, the stunts are terrific, Uma is dazzling, the humor is hilarious and the last sentence in the movie left me in quite a shock. You have to see this movie, no question about it. The critics were right about this film. The special features are also pretty damn cool which include: the making of Kill Bill Vol. 1, music performances by the 5,6,7,8's (or whatever) and Tarantino trailers. Definitley worth your cash. Now stop reading this and go watch this classic and amazing film now!!!!!!! Also check out Kill Bill Vol. 2 and other Tarantino films!!!

0393324818|5.0|Ever since free agency became integrated into baseball culture, the current wisdom has always been that the small-market teams must finish at the bottom because they don't have the resources to compete with larger market teams such as the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Chicago White Sox. The 1997 Florida Marlins spent their way to winning the World Series, but had to conduct a fire sale the next year in order to avoid bankruptcy. This, say the pundits, is in keeping with the current wisdom.<br />But there is an exception, and a rather large one at that. The Oakland A's, for years the epitome of the small market team, sharing a small market with the National League San Francisco Giants, have managed to win more games (553) from 1998 through 2003 than any other team save for the large market New York Yankees (598) and the Atlanta Braves (594). Now here's the kicker: In 2002, Oakland won 103 games, as many as the Yankees and two more than the Braves, with a payroll ($42M) only one-third the size of the Yankees ($133M) and half that of the Braves ($94M). Is this merely the exception that proves the rule, or is something else going on here?<br />\\"Moneyball\\" provides some of the answers. It is an in-depth look at how the Oakland A's, without the money of the Yankees, managed to win as many games by just looking at the baseball universe in a different way. The old rule was \\"you gotta spend money to make money.\\" The '97 Florida Marlins spent their way to the World Series, and lost about $30 million in the process. They were forced to dump salary the next year and ended up alienation an already small fan base, which cut attendance even further. Billy Beane, the GM of the Athletics, realized early on that you can't spend what you don't have; thus consistency is the ideal. In this case, consistency is gained by getting the best players for the least money. To achieve this, Beane just looked at the same thing in a different way. Judge players by the things they can control rather than the things they can't control.<br />This is vividly illustrated in the case of Jeremy Brown, a catcher with the University of Alabama who was pooh-poohed by major league scouts, including Oakland's, as a \\"bad body catcher.\\" But when Beane and his staff looked at Brown, they saw the only player in the history of the SEC with three hundred hits and two hundred walks. For Beane, the ability to control the strike zone was the best predicator of future success, and the large number of walks was an indicator of how well Brown was able to control the strike zone. The same held true for a pitcher. The speed of his fastball wasn't as important as the ratio of walks to strikeouts. Brown may have been slightly overweight and slow afoot, but he understood the strike zone. The same with pitcher Barry Zito, another overlooked Beane discovery. Zito may not have had that blazing fastball, but he knew how to manipulate the strike zone. What Beane and his staff did was simple: take statistics that already exist and rank them differently. If the game from the hitter's view is not to make outs, then the stat of on-base percentage becomes the best indicator of plate success.<br />What Beane and his staff knew that the others didn't was that, when humans are involved, the physics of baseball changes dramatically. There are an almost endless variety of books on the physics of baseball, illustrating the Newtonian principles of the curve ball, but when the human factor is computed the game comes down to probabilities. Newton ceases to reign. Heisenberg rules. While Beane's methods do not assure absolute success they do cut down on the probabilities, and that for the serious baseball fan is what the game is all about.<br />The paperback edition contains a beautifully written postscript entitled \\"Inside Baseball's Religious War.\\" It is a counter-attack against the critics of the book and at the same time a devastating example of why baseball is in the mess it's in. The critics missed the point, seeing \\"Moneyball\\" as an exaltation of Billy Beane instead of as an examination of his system and why it has worked as well as it has. If baseball is to prosper, it has to forego the myopia that plagues it, and that is the real point Lewis is making.tics missed the point, seeing \\"Moneyball\\" as an exaltation of Billy Beane instead of as an examination of his system and why it has worked as well as it has.

0486266885|4.0|The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a great book.  I thought it was strange that the author would kill Hyde/Jekyll off so early in the book, but he pulled it together nicely with the two narratives in the end.  I also thought the wording in the book was very easy to understand, and it gave you a defiant sense of suspense throughout the book.<BR> I did,  however, feel that Hyde could have been more evil.  I just always thought of Hyde as a horribly disfigured and large man.  Therefore, when you see only two murders and a dwarf as the villain you are somewhat disappointed.  Hollywood has played him up as a huge man , and that is one thing I realized by reading this novel. He is a small individual.

1401300901|5.0|I heard about this book from a friend, and picked it up thinking it would be a good entertaining book to pass time.  So, I picked it up and then put it down when I was done!  Although I can't relate to the character, oftentimes the writing reminded me of others I had lost, relating to my friends and family, and just sucked me in.  Most enjoyable was the banter between Holly and her friends, and the lingo from native UK. <BR>What I found most surprising, is that someone as young as Ms. Ahern could write with such depth, and put this kind of life experience in to words, writing with what one would assume is the is the knowledge of someone who has lived much longer and experience so much more.  Bravo, and keep them coming!

0486266885|5.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. hyde is a story that is told in weird scenario.  This is a book that is told in a collection of letters.  the letters compile to make a great scary story for people of all ages.  The fact that this story is told the way it is gives it a real life feeling.  When I was reading it I felt like it was a real case that happened in the streets of London.  The letters that are made make it seem like that the case happened because it gives the tail of many people from the story.  Even though the story is well known around Europe and the US the ending is still classic.  The fact that the story is ended in a letter is quite original on Stevenson's part.  It probably would have been more of a thriller if I had known the ending. The ending is probably the most well known in literature history and that kind of stinks.  This book will actually make you touch a little on you evil side.<BR>            By:  Alex Cruce

I felt like Grisham's writing was almost fluid, his character development being some of the best I can remember from any of his books.  At the end when Callie's family was gathered around her bed at the hospital, I felt like I was standing there in the room with them, and that I would recognize any of them on the street if I were to pass them.<BR>Overall, this book was just fun to read!
0345440900|4.0|Being a new mom this book was very helpful to me.  I felt it was less legalistic than some of the other books I had read (example - Becoming Babywise).  However, it offered some great tips on understanding my newborn.  She has a chart in there that describes the connection between certain physical signs and what the baby is saying.  For example when baby arches her back, it means she is tired.  I refered to this chart more than once a day.  It was amazing how true it was. It helped me catch what my daughter needed before she became frustrated.  She also had a wonderful tool that helped me teach my baby how to fall asleep on her own.  I had seen other tools that do this, but hers added extra steps to calm my daughter - so she wouldn't go to bed screaming.  It worked great!  And my daughter and I learned so much that she started falling asleep on her own within 5 minutes of putting her down and she was sleeping through the night at 6 weeks.  I recommend this to any new mom -in fact I am purchasing it for a baby shower gift!

0425170349|3.0|True to form, Tom Clancy has cooked up yet another super-tense technothriller.  This time the threat is bioterrorism on a global scale, all part of a nefarious plot hatched by a gaggle of environmentalist wacko intelligentsia types that frequently find themselves on the receiving end of some unflattering commentary by Rush Limbaugh and his contemporaries. These \\"characters\\" are really more like caricatures, with their off-the-wall ideas and somewhat corny dialogue.  But when you throw in the ultra-sexy element of high-end, world class special ops, you have all the makings of an awesome read -- until the end.<br /><br />The basic premise is that a group of self-styled defenders of Mother Earth are conspiring to restore her to her pristine, unsullied state by eliminating the chief cause of her defilement -- humanity.  They will do this by developing and deploying an ultravirulent bioagent designed to render mankind extinct -- except for themselves and a few \\"chosen\\".  These will be immunized with an appropriate vaccine, and will whether the storm in a \\"biodome\\" type of facility.  After the cycle of bio-death has run its course, they will emerge to rebuild humanity and civilization \\"as it was meant to be\\", in an environmentally sound and sensitive way.<br /><br />These goings-on just happen to coincide with the assembly of a multinational force of special ops experts built around John Clark, with Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez (of \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" fame) as the XO and senior field operative.  This organization, known as \\"Rainbow\\", will fill the gaps in counterterrorism efforts of other individual nations by providing an integrated rapid-response team with all the necessary jurisdictional and diplomatic details hammered out in advance.  As luck would have it, little hints begin to drop and little pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together over time, allowing the goods guys ultimately to stymie the evildoers.<br /><br />This one is chock full of suspense and gritty action sequences, with some slick operations involving all manner of high tech weapons and gadgetry -- you would expect nothing less from Clancy.  There are also some pulse pounding hostage rescue situations where the Rainbow team shows just how good it is -- but not perfect.  Generally speaking it's a great read and a good time, but I was incredibly disappointed by the anticlimactic ending -- Clancy definitely dropped the ball on this one.  I'm not sure what happened, but he had an opportunity to make this a top-notch thriller and he just plain blew it.  I've read only about a third to a half of what Clancy has in print, so I'll just get over it and hope the next one of his books I pick up doesn't have the same flaw.lick operations involving all manner of high tech weapons and gadgetry -- you would expect nothing less from Clancy.

B0001N1RU8|5.0|I found this to be an excellent CD. Some people seem to be upset because of the original material on the CD.  I happen to like new music, the old tunes being redone over and over is getting very boring. About the only track I did not like was Black Crow, but I still think this CD deserves 5 stars.
0688163173|2.0|As someone who has read and loved every other single piece of Dennis Lehane's work - almost fanatically - this book is a huge disappointment and hopefully not a harbinger of things to come. The plot is transparent, cliched, and the characters can neither be liked nor hated, nor anything in between - there is no complexity to this novel at all - I saw the end coming a mile away and could barely rouse the energy to finish it. At the end, I didn't care what was real or what wasn't, nor did I spend any time imgaining what could have happened next - I was just glad it was over and even considered putting back onto Amazon marketplace for sale which is nearly unheard of for me. I hope Lehane isn't letting his publishers pressure him to produce too much too fast - he has built an amazing reputation; a few stumbles along the way like Shutter Island are OK - I just hope they don't become the norm.

0671027344|5.0|Amazing is one word to describe this book in my opinion.<br />I have read many books based on guys opinions and usually their feelings are not expressed as well. Charlie in this book is the sweetest, cutest boy you will ever &quot;know&quot;.<BR>He seems to be very caring and he is always worried about other people's lives and is always carrying other people's problems on his shoulders.<BR>Throughout the whole book we learn about his life by reading letters he is writing to us I suppose? So we begin to see things in his eyes and feel things the way he does.<BR>I don't know what it was about this book but it made me love the main character and in a way feel very bad for him because he cared about people so much yet no one really seemed to care about him too much.<BR>I thought this was a very good book and everybody should definately read it!

B00005BL2A|4.0|People have to realize that romantically dark Depeche Mode of the 80s, teenagers' darlings of &quot;Violator&quot; period, and uneasy sounding Depeche Mode of today are 3 entirely different bands. Part of it must have something to do with the band leaders becoming clean of substance abuse. This important move always impacts the music in some way or another, and Depeche Mode is not an exception.<br />The sad truth is, &quot;Exciter&quot; is inferior to such timeless classics as &quot;Violator&quot; or &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;. It doesn't even reach the high mark set by &quot;Ultra&quot;. However, it's quite an enjoyable album with several very strong songs. Its production is different from anything the band has released before. It's very guitar-oriented and contains plenty of industrial clicks and noises. David Gahan's voice also has a different sound, not so sensual as in the 80s. Though mellow sounding, this album also develops some subconscious uneasy feeling of tension, which is due to the guitar-playing style and the background clicks. It works very well in a number of songs, but fails to produce a credible result in some other. I also got the feeling that the band tried to create an illusionary 3-dimensional soundscape of various noises, guitar string sounds and percussion. It works best in &quot;Shine&quot;, but this effect is present in all the songs. However, you need a high-quality stereo-system in order to fully appreciate the effect.<br />To me, this album's feel is very introspective and intimate. Several songs are written with no drums or percussion at all. Even the harder tracks &quot;Dream On&quot; and &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; aren't aggressive. My favorite tracks here are &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;Freelove&quot;, both of which I'll put anywhere in the 10 best songs by Depeche Mode ever. &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; and &quot;Shine&quot; are also good. But sadly, the songwriting is inconsistent, and there are some very weak and unmemorable songs on the album. This inconsistency is perhaps the main reason for this album's relatively low final result. Let's hope, next time Depeche Mode will be more focused on songwriting.
0385512104|5.0|This book will knock your socks off!  I guarentee you've never read anything like this before.  Christopher gives Rain Man a run for his money!<br />Mark Haddon has done a superb job of creating the character of Autistic Christopher.  What's more, as you start reading, he's not a character any longer, he's real...In this book Christopher has found his neighbor's dog murdered, so he decides to play detective, like his idol Sherlock Holmes, and find out who killed him.  So begins the journey, which actually leads into ta much larger adventure, as Christopher begins to uncover that things in his life are not as they seem.  You see, Christopher may be autistic, but he's a wiz at math and science and he's also unusually perceptive.  The way Haddon goes through Chris's thought process and daily activities is pure genius.  And to add depth to the story, I found his parents &amp; some of the other characters in this book, also very &quot;real&quot;.  There aren't any perfect people in this book, this is real life.<br />I sincerely recommend this book to you.  It's a quick read at only 220 pages, and the wit at which Haddon writes, makes those pages fly by.  Very rarely does a book make me laugh out-loud, and this book did that several times.  Bravo!

B000003EUL|5.0|What can we add to this performance? Apart of its undeniable virtues, the essence of this version is that Richter is always seeking in every one of his achievements. Try with his two performances of Pictures at exhibition (Spofia and Bucarest) with only a week between the two concerts in 1958.<br />The discography about the second concert is one of the widest in the main repertoire for the keyboard.<br />But, however there are so very few fortunate achievements. And Richter prints his skills not only his passionate fire and evil technique, but he illuminates the score. And that's the key why you are able to listen this Symphony with piano obligatto without an atom of indifference.<br />This work demands an exceptional imagination , due to its length, who doubts about the beauty of the slow movement? Richter walks all along the piece avoiding all kind of effectism, and over all in the last movement , he adds histamina and strong conviction.<br />Leinsdorff deserves a just mention. Because in every moment he conducts the orchestra with the precise approach of being performing chamber music. This is the clue for getting a happy performing, because if you conduct the orchestra in piano's service, you are taking an inmense risk and probably you get a standard version but never outstanding like this one.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Wow! What a spectacular adventure! I thought to myself after seeing this movie. Even the slow parts kept my attention. It could have been a six-hour mini-series and I still would have sat through it!<br />Within the short time of watching life abroad the HMS Surprise, I felt as if I was part of the crew, I knew the men so well. The studious ship surgeon, salty old seamen, insecure junior officers, and the crusty cook. Of course, none commanded the respect of the captain, \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey.<br />Russell Crowe demands the same respect from the audience as he did in \\"Gladiator,\\" as someone who leads by his presence, strength, and umimpeachable sense of duty. The viewer feels his conviction as he orders his men to pursue the French \\"Acheron,\\" a more powerful warship that has already crippled his ship. In a desperate race, he patches up the ship and pursues it around South America chasing it into deadly high seas contest.<br />Even though Aubrey comes across as a \\"nice guy\\" much of the time, it's clear he is \\"master and commander\\" and tolerates no disrespect, be it a mouthy seaman or his best friend.<br />While Crowe drives much of the movie, it is also fueled by an equally strong performance by Paul Bettany, who plays the ship's surgeon and naturalist. What makes him such a strong foil for Crowe is not their differences, but their similarities. Both are driven by a sense of duty, but their goals are different and conflicting. Knowing they are close friends makes their conflict all the more intense.<br />The sense of realism strikes true for much of the film too. You can feel the freezing winds of the Horn, experience the loneliness of a professional sailor's heart, hear the snapping lines in the gale, smell the stench of gunpowder, and feel the heat of the doldrums. I think the only thing I couldn't experience was the food, (these guys eat all the time!) which was probably a good thing. (Saused pig's head? Yeach!)
B00005JKQ6|5.0|This film is unique in all the american filmography. You may exhibit several examples about the question of the loneliness , like Sunset boulevard, Midnight cowboy, the naked kiss or even Butterfield 8. These films are worthy. But no film before and even thirty six years (with the exceptions of Paris Texas and American beauty) had approached the question in just so brutally dramatic, showing the naked soul of a mature man in a suden decadence.<br />Perry had the Midas touch when the story goes through all the swimming pool of Kentucky.<br />An intimate portrayal,a collage that describes like a few, the roughness, the cruelty the indifference of the human condition around a man who lost his center, his eaning for living, and surviving just by feeding his memories.<br />His ancient friends, his old love affairs , show us with no mercy the unboreble loneliness of this man who was once and now he's just a post card human, a colection piece , a lost specimen<br />from an old tale.<br />Lancaster gives us an unforgettable performing. I{m absolutely sure that the character of Lancaster in Atlantic city, was so easy to Burt, due he applied the emotive memory, apart his notable skills.<br />The swimmer is a cult movie. It's a acid view about a society who doesn't accept the failure, which runs from a lonely man who doesn't have to say excepts his memories.<br />Do you remember the sequence when he tries to get into the swimming pool in which he must to clean his feet before to get in? . The metaphor is so absorbing and fascinating that you can not forget easily. And the ending is very close to a horror film.<br />Please, don't forget this ending and try to tie with the end of 21 grams.<br />Momma dearest was made several years after. But in my particular opinion. Frank Perry will be remembered by this unvaluable gem of the best artistic expression american cinema.
0790729644|1.0|Unforgiven is an appropriate title for this mess, only it's Eastwood who should be UNFORGIVEN for turning out such a ghastly production. Clint, you've done MUCH BETTER.(&quot;Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; for one) But either star in or direct, don't do both! Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman were the only saving graces here and to be blunt, Freeman did the better job. He reminded me somewhat of the character &quot;Grave Digger&quot; from &quot;Glory&quot; in that he didn't have the advantage of a great deal of &quot;book learning&quot; but he was WISER than most. The idea of a worn out gunfighter forced to return to his &quot;trade&quot; has been done plenty of times and it HAS worked, but I've said it before, I'll say it again, Hollywood can't make a decent Western anymore.
B000148KK2|5.0|Can there be anything more beautifully bittersweet than the emotional dichotomy of a death and a marriage? The resulting album as those emotions are explored and exposed is here in Ms. Kralls newest tangent. Some of the more scathing review(ers) are perhaps feeling what I did at first listen...whoa, this album is personal, perhaps too personal. The collaborations with Mr. Costello bring forth what diehard fans have known for a long time...there is a raw emotion that has served Ms. Krall well with past offerings of standards...this album brings forth (lyrically) the deepest of those emotions...thank god Ms. Krall has the chops to make it work.<br />The swinging piano continues with this offering (though lacks the solos of all instruments that I associate with Ms. Krall)...as close as you can get to a live performance, a la \\"Live in Paris\\". Jeff Hamilton works his magic, as does John Clayton on three select tracks...sounds like old times. That's the key here...the old times were great...the new times, with the release of this album, are sure to be greater as Ms. Krall explores the depth of her songwriting talents. She must, however, keep offering her exquisite interpretations of standards. That is what made her...that's her core...that's not too much to ask.<br />If you are a longtime listener be prepared for something totally different with this album, a la \\"The Look of Love\\". If you're not ready for the emotional depth of the offerings then buy it, shelf it and wait for a death or marriage to give it a listen. Harsh? Well, maybe..but as we all mature (even Ms. Krall feels the blows of life) our emotional experiences become deeper and more meaningful...too bad we all don't have the artistic outlet to reveal and release those emotions. Thankfully we have Ms. Krall to help us through those times.<br />I've seen that others are having the same difficulty as me with this CD not playing on certain players. I drive about 4 hours a day and wanted to relish this CD alone inmy car...by lo and behold, this is the ONLY CD in my collection that WILL NOT play in my car. It plays on my cheapy office CD player...I haven't dared try it on my computer. Come on folks pressing and releasing this CD...if enhanced means it only plays on CERTAIN players, then I will be most likely NEVER buy an enhanced CD from you again. P.S. My Josh Groban enhanced CD plays on everything I own...now, why's that? Figure it out and release a CD that plays on all players!!!!!!!
081541028X|5.0|There have been several excellent Apollo astronaut memoirs, especially Gene Cernan's &quot;The Last Man on the Moon&quot; and Jim Lovell's &quot;Lost Moon,&quot; which was made into the feature film &quot;Apollo 13.&quot; This one is still the most honest and reflective of them all. It extends a tradition of the aviator as litterateur into the age of space travel.<br />Collins had an illustrious career as an astronaut. Chosen in the third group of astronauts in 1963, he served as backup pilot for Gemini VII, pilot for Gemini X, and command module pilot for Apollo 11. On that last mission he became the loneliest man in the universe when his two crewmates, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, landed on the Moon while he remained in orbit around the Moon in the Command Module. In &quot;Carrying the Fire&quot; Collins writes of his solitude in lunar orbit in July 1969. As he disappeared on the backside of the Moon from Earth, he recalled, \\"I am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life, I am it. If a count were taken, the score would be three billion plus two over on the other side of the moon, and one plus God only knows what on this side. I feel this powerfully-not as fear or loneliness-but as awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation. I like the feeling. Outside my window I can see stars-and that is all. Where I know the moon to be, there is simply a black void, the moon's presence is defined solely by the absence of stars.\\" He compared it to being in a skiff in the middle of the ocean with only the stars above and black water below. It proved a profoundly moving experience for him.<br />Michael Collins left NASA in 1970 and became the first director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, continuing to write eloquently of the possibilities of spaceflight. Among other works he published &quot;Liftoff: The Story of America's Adventure in Space&quot; (1988) and &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; (1990), a powerful exposition on the value of a human mission to Mars.<br />&quot;Carrying the Fire&quot; is the first candid book about life as an astronaut. The author comments on other astronauts, describes the seemingly endless preparations for flights to the Moon, and assesses the results. He also describes what he thinks of as the most important perspective that emerged from his flight, a realization of the fragility of the Earth. He wrote that \\"from space there is no hint of ruggedness to it; smooth as a billiard ball, it seems delicately poised on its circular journey around the Sun, and above all it seems fragile...Is the sea water clean enough to pour over your head, or is there a glaze of oil on its surface?...Is the riverbank a delight or an obscenity? The difference between a blue-and-white planet and a black-and-brown one is delicate indeed.\\"<br />It is a powerful and moving memoir. Read it more than once and lend copies to your friends.

With everything that occurs in this book there's never a dull moment.  I liked the idea of how Stevenson used one man, but transformed him into someone else.  The mystery of finding Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is what I enjoyed.  Mr. Utterson and Enfield thought there were two different people when there was only one.  If your wanting to read a book that keeps you wandering and guessing, well this is the perfect book.  I really enjoyed reading this book.
B000003ER4|5.0|All that has remained in the repertoire of this excellent work are the duly famous 4 minutes of `Marietta's Lied`, hailed by some as one of the most beautiful things in all 20th century opera. It certainly packs an emotional punch worthy of Puccini at his peak, and its return at the very end is heart wrenching. I've seen critics regret the fact that the rest of Die Tote Stadt is 'not on the same level', but really, that's a bit like complaining the rest of Turandot is not quite like Nessun dorma... In fact, the opera was a huge success at its premiere and widely admired by contemporary composers, Puccini as well as Alban Berg among them. And rightly so, which can only make us wonder more at its subsequent neglect. Korngold is just one of those composers who never really made it into the limelight, even though he wrote much that is instantly accessible and quite exciting.<br />Indeed, the whole two hours of this piece are enthralling, mainly on the strength of the expert and colourful writing for the (gargantuan) orchestra. Imagine a kind of Elektra meets Gurrelieder cocktail with an added dash of Zemlinsky, Mahler and, yes, Puccini, and you may get some idea of what to expect. I was also put in mind of that other forgotten great opera, Pfitzner's Palestrina. It doesn't make for relaxed listening: the general tone is a bit too excited and even hysterical for that, as befits an opera exploring the obviously Freudian theme of mourning gone haywire. But it's anything but monotonous. One moment a boating song plunges you straight into the world of Viennese light operetta, the next this gay party is subsumed by the extraordinary and spectacular sounds of an organ and a plethora of bells, and you are in a sound world that is as modern as it is captivating.<br />The vocal parts are extremely agitated and rather highly strung; I cannot help but feel they occasionally overtax the lead singers. Both Neblett and Kollo produce some very strained, even shrill top notes, and there are many top notes in both parts! On the whole, however, the singing is admirable, and the orchestral playing is of an even higher order. The recording, too, though 30 years old, is quite good: it allows you to hear lots of detail, and has an ample dynamic range. We ought to be rightly grateful for having it, and as long as there is no competition other than Segerstam's live recording on Naxos, this set is very much worth acquiring. Meanwhile, there certainly is room for a high profile modern remake. Wouldn't it be a perfect way for Chailly to start his tenure at the helm of the Leipzig Opera and Gewandhausorchester? If Decca would then be so kind as to hire Ren&eacute;e Fleming as Marietta, something truly wonderful might come out...e many top notes in both parts!

0393312836|4.0|I've heard from many people that after the first chapter or so of &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; they gave up because of the NADSAT.  Nadsat is a slang invented by Burgess, that is a mixture of Russian and, well, nonsense.  There are resources available to define these nadsat words, but in most cases it is not even necessary.  Many of the words, in context, are self-explanatory, and those which are not can often be passed by without tainting the reader's experience.<br />If you can get past the brilliant but difficult slang, this book is definitely a good read.  Burgess also wrote symphonies, and this is apparent in his works.  This book is no exception.  The book serves almost as a mirror:  the first section is a slow build, the second section is the middle ground--and also where much of the action takes place, and the third section is a slow decline to the end:  much like a reversal of the first section.  <br />&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is incredibly thought-provoking--it really makes you look to yourself, check your own values and beliefs.  What is right?  Is free will more important than a safe society?  This book is great, and I would recommend it for both classroom reading as well as reading for pleasure.
0553579908|4.0|I have no idea why Martin continues to talk about his love of Tolkien (even calling him the greatest author of the 20th century), despite having de-throned his minions (pretty much any current fantasy writer) with no Tolkien standard black-and-white characters, no Dwarves, and no Elves, and being on the verge of ridding fantasy forever of the blowhard (and forget your delusions of Tolkien inventing fantasy, Robert Howard wrote long before him).<br />This second volume is another masterpiece.  Once again Martin manages to blur the lines of good and evil, most prominently in Tyrion and Varys, but in virtually everyone else too.  There are no truly &quot;good&quot; characters, and the only purely &quot;evil&quot; character is Joffrey.<br />I've said his previous volume was reminescent of &quot;Dune&quot;, in fact the only reason it got four stars instead of five was because the parrallels between Leto and Eddard made Eddard's fate obvious, and the chapters spent developing him seem somewhat redundant (of course the character's whose deaths surprise me are fine).  Anyway, this second volume no longer mirror's &quot;Dune&quot;, but that's fine with me because the whole message of Dune was &quot;YOU FREAKIN' IDIOTIC HUMANS, WHY ARE YOU STANDING AROUND WAITING TO KILL FANATICALLY FOR THE FIRST SO-CALLED MESSIAH THAT COMES ALONG!!!  THINK FOR YOUR SEEEELLLLLVVVEEESSS!!!!&quot; So I won't hold it against Martin that he thinks for himself.<br />From what I've read of the other reviews the most popular character is Tyrion, and his fans get plenty of him in this book.  Unfortunately though, my favorite character, Daenarys, is an underused element who seems to be waiting for a later book to DO something, and that cost Martin one star from me.

If you're never really sure just where that comma goes, or when to use a semi-colon, this book is for you, too!<br />This book was really entertaining, plus it included the basic rules for the correct use of punctuation.  The author includes LOTS of examples of both correct and incorrect usage.  Just keep in mind that the author is British so some of the rules are slightly different.  She generally points those differences out.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was fortunate enough to find a fellow Zeppelin fan on the absolutely terrifying first day of grade 9 who actually had this album, and knew something about Led Zeppelin.  I tended to shy away from live albums, mostly because I thought all bands were dreadful live, so when I read on the back that it was \\"performed,\\" I wasn't as excited.  I listened to it anyways, of course, and I was blown away... THIS album is what turned me into an absurdly die-hard Zeppelin fanatic. <br />It starts out with a bunch of screaming fans, (\\"L.A. Drone\\") and then goes right into \\"Immigrant Song.\\" The vocals on the part of Plant are, as always, amazing, and Page's guitaring is phemonenal.  After that, you have \\"Heartbreaker,\\" one of my favourites.  I actually like the live version better than the regular one.  \\"Black Dog,\\" the next song, is absolutely, and I say this without hyperbole, the SINGLE BEST SONG EVER.  You have Page's extremely rock-tastic riffs, and Plant wailing \\"oh yeah, oh yeah.\\" What could get better than that?!  Once again, I thought it was better than the regular version.  Sure, the lyrics aren't amazing or deep or anything, but it's a great song.  \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" is another classic, the guitaring is still (and always will be) terrific, and Plant's singing brings it all together.  \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" is mellow and soulful and mournful and everything else a Zeppelin song should be... I particularlily thought Page did a great job here (as always).  Next, we have the classic.  \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is just as it should be... Especially the amazing solo.  A classic, to be sure.  \\"Going to California\\" is next... This isn't one of my all-time favourite songs, but I still enjoy it.  \\"That's the Way\\" ...I don't have much to say about this song, other than that it's alright... Just alright.  \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp!!!!!!\\"  Oh my this is a great song.  It makes you want to dance around, (This may be the crazy 14-Year-Old girl talking) and it's so... Gripping.  Idon't think thats the correct word but I always listen to it all the way through.  \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" is another classic.  Great bass line, unique song, and Plant's crooning is the icing on the cake, if this song were a cake.  This song also has \\"Walter's Walk\\" and \\"The Crunge\\" in it, but I can't recall much singing, just a lot of guitaring and such. <br />Oh dear... \\"What is and What Should Never Be\\" is so extraordinary that only people with Acute Die-Hard Zeppelin Fan Syndrome should listen to it.  You have great guitar, bass, vocals, and drumming... What more could you ask for?!  \\"Dancing Days\\" is next, and yet again an splendid song.  This album is so good I am running out of positive adjectives; therefore, it is very...er...SUPERB.  \\"Moby Dick\\" is next.  This song is pretty substantial at 19 minutes... but it has some great guitaring, and Bonham's drum solo is very memorable.  <br />Almost done... Four more songs so analyze!  \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is next. WOW! What a great song!  If you get this album, and listen to \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" fir the first time, the opening guitar will blow you away!  As well as the awesome guitaring, you of course have Plant's voice, Bonham's percussion, and Jones' bass all molded into some sort of super-fantastic song.  There are other little songs on this 23-minute track. You also have Boogie Chillun/Let's Have a Party/Hello Marylou/Going.  They consist of a lot of guitar solos, a lot of bass, and lots of other good stuff like that.  \\"Rock and Roll!!!!!!!!!\\"  Well, if there was ever a song that made you want to get up and do some sort of humiliating dance, this is it.  Do not take this album to work and play it, because you will dance to this song... As well as doing some embarassing air-guitar... Not that I would know, of course.  I'm far too cool for that.  i just sing up high in a Robert Plant-esque voice.  The nest song is \\"The Ocean.\\"  It's not too long (in Zeppelin terms) And the guitaring is once again great, as well as thesinging, the bass, percussion... EVERYTHING. \\"Bring it on Home/Bring it on Back\\" is good n' bluesy. It's a grand finale to a grand album. I thought the harmonica was surprisingly great! After all everyone knows that the Beatles got immeasurably better after John learned he was not a skilled harmonica-ist... But not in Zeppelin's case!  After a while, this song becomes more rock-like, not that it's a bad thing.  <br />Sorry for the rather long review, but I'm quite passionate about this album.  I hope you'll go out and buy it, or if you don't like the price just convince your friend to get it and then just snatch it and commit a bit of piracy music-wise.<br />In conclusion, I shall end with a quote.  As Otto, the school bus driver from the Simpsons once said:  \\"ZEPPELIN RUUUULLLLES!!!!\\"  (As well as How the West was Won)
0451526295|3.0|This book starts off slowly but picks up its pace after the marriage of one of its character.  Fanny, the book's heroine, is bland and boring in the beginning but becomes increasingly interesting as the book moves along.  There are two obvious couples in this book that the reader can cheer for, Henry with Fanny and Mary with Edmund.  Just when it seems that Jane Austen would transform Henry from an arrogant gentleman into a thoughtful and sensitive suitor for Fanny (like Mr. Darcy in P&amp;B) and Mary from a money-hungry woman to someone succumbing to the power of love, she drops the bomb on all of us with a scandal that leaves everyone in the end not completely happy.  Sure, Fanny eventually marries someone she loves, but do we really want our heroine to marry someone who only thinks of her as a sister and loves her only after another woman breaks his heart?  If it's a tragic ending that Jane Austen wants, then make it tragic.  If it's supposed to be a happy ending, then please make it all-out happy.  This middle-of-the-road kind of happy ending is most unsatisfying.
B00000DOZH|4.0|Bon and Angus and the rest of the gang at their finest.  Mark my words: I may be an ignorant, stupid, 14 year old girl... but I know what's good.  This is better than good.  <br />1) Highway to Hell - Excellent song, a classic.  Of course, you have Angus' guitar to thank for that.<BR>2) Girls Got Rhythm - What a coincidence!  Another great song!  <BR>3) Walk all Over You - What can I say?!  It's great!<BR>4) Touch too Much - I must think of more positive adjectives.  Angus is God.<BR>5) Beating Around the Bush - Superb guitaring... THIS is why Angus should be revered as a GOD!<BR>6) Shot Down in Flames - If they play this song in public, you have to suppress the urge to humiliate yourself playing air guitar.<BR>7) Get it Hot - I don't know why this song reminds me of the Rolling Stones.  Maybe it's the tune.  Great tune by the way.  Why did Bon have to die?<BR>8) If You want Blood - Oh my this song is great. Splendid splendid splendid.  You have to sing along to the chorus in a Bon-like voice.  (&quot;BLOOOOD on the streets, BLOOOOD on the rocks, BLOOOOD in the gutter, EVERY LAST DROP!!!!!!&quot;)<BR>9) Love Hungry Man - I don't see why they were so love-hungry.  They could easily pay for a lifetime of debauchery.  OH WELL!  At least it inspired them to create a great song.<BR>10) Night Prowler - This is THE song.  An excellent stalking song if there ever was one.  A grand finale... and a grand album indeed.  <br />This album is too short.
B000067FP7|4.0|Gremlins is a movie that you should have seen already by now, you either love it or hate it, and i love it! Both of them. <br />by now youve seen 100 reviews of the movie. So i'll skip that and just review what i think of the speichel edition.<br />The bonus features arnt really worth it. There is a couple of audio comentarys. The featurette is a short forgettable little thing from on the set, but dont expect there to be anything about how things where done or anything, its a featurette from while the movie was beeing made. The photos I never take intrest to. Theres 3 trailers, whoopie! and a few deleted scenes that are very forgettable, but most disapoitning about that, is if you listen to the audio commentary, they admit there are alot more deleted scenes that arnt on the disc!<br />Overall, I really dont see why this is called the special edition? It really should have been presented the way it is here in the first place. but there honestly isnt really anything special about it! its a basic DVD layout really! If your hanging out to see the bonus features, then you might be like me and just agree that there could have been much more?<br />But overall, the movie is still great, and thats always worth the price.... if your intrested in the bonus features, then go for this S.E version, if your not at all intrested....then the regular edition might be better, if it's cheaper? But this classic will always remain a classic! But I do wish they could have added a lot more bonus material and shown some more in-depth looks at puppets and enginering.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|This cd is nowhere near any eminem solo album. The beats are too repetitive, and the hooks too annoying. But overall, its still a solid. the last 2 tracks and the 1st track are some of the best ive heard from D12. Buy this cd if you need a new rap album.
B00008ADPF|5.0|As an old geezer, I can't say I am a big fan of grunge rock, but having seen Nickelback in concert on MTV, there was something about  their great driving rock and super percussion riffs that lead me to buy this album.  Now it has a permanent spot in my car CD player. I turn it on almost every time I hit the road, and it never fails to put me in a good mood. Cuts like Someday; Feelin' Way Too Damn Good; and Figured You Out keep growing on you until they're like ear bugs I can't help humming throughout the day. Like any album, a couple of songs could have been left out, but overall this album is great.
0618526412|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the few perfect books.  While I love Oprah's picks, some of them haven't resonated with me.  But \\"The Heat is a Lonely Hunter\\" does, along with \\"East of Eden.\\"  By far, this pick is long overdue.  Having initially read this novel in high school, it was a great pleasure to revisit it once again.  Thank you Oprah for bringing this great work of fiction back into our lives (...)
B00005JMTN|5.0|This movie was one I expected to hate.  Okay, maybe I just expected to be bored and disappointed for my ten dollars.  What I didn't expect was that it would capture me from the very improbable beginning, and keep me hooked throughout the entire film.  The writing is superb; it flows seamlessly from one scene to the next, and each scene builds on the one before it.  There are many tall tales to be had in this movie, yet you will find yourself believing in the unbelievable.  There are tender and touching scenes, laugh-out-loud scenes, and \\"where is my kleenex when I need it\\" scenes, yet all are woven together in a masterfully told tale of truth.  This movie is definitely a keeper, and I intend to own it, so that I can watch it again and again.  The acting was excellent, the directing was beyond measure, yet I still believe it was the STORY of the Big Fish that made this such a terrifically enjoyable movie. I give it a resounding A+++
B00003CXA6|4.0|To understand this film one first has to come to the understanding that trying to fit the entire battle of Gettysburg in one film is impossable. The battle was 3 days long spread out over a very large area involving over 200,000 men. This film does not try to tell that entire story. Instead what the filmakers have done is take Michael Shaara's historical novel and literary masterpiece 'Killer Angels', and turned it into a first rate film.<br />What the film Gettysburg does (and what the book it's based on did) is view the battle from personal perspectives. In this case the perspectives of General James Longstreet and his commanders on the Confederate side and Col Joshua Chamberlain, General Winfield Hancock and General John Buford on the Federal side. We see the battle through their eyes and thus we're able to see it in a human perspective. While this make the battle easier for us to follow, it does leave out certain important areas of the battle such as Culp's Hill.<br />In the end however we do get a film that captures the spirit of the men who fought at Gettysburg and a film that surprisingly keeps very close to the book it's based on. There are historical inaccuracies of course in the film and a few myths are reinforced here and there but for the most part these do not detract to much from the film.<br />So sit back and enjoy this fine film and if you enjoy it enough that you want to learn more about Gettysburg then pick up Edwin Coddington's or Stephen Sears's book on the battle. Both have written first rate books that cover the entire Gettysburg campaign in one volume.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|One must have viewed all the previous Matrix releases before fully understanding this final (?) motion picture. It is obvious that each subsequent picture should actually lead to a conclusion that can be realistic.<br />One would think after KR's ability at the end of Matrix 1, that how can there actually be anymore Matrix pictures. Well, they came up with a grand plot, and the trilogy is a must see.<br />Even with the Oracle passing away in her real life, the makers of the Matrix did an excellent job in her replacement, and her dedication. Some people see the surface of this picture, while others see behind the screen. I like to say that I can see them connected in each scene. That's what I get for being a Poet.
0062502182|1.0|I read this book to find out what all the fuss was about. What followed was sour disappointment. <br />Storyline: No more sophisticated than those shortened bible stories for five-year olds. <BR>Style: I have read microwave oven instructions with more literary flair. <BR>Characterization: Flat, lifeless \\"characters\\", distinguishable only through phrases like \\"the boy\\", \\"the girl\\", or \\"the Englishman\\". <BR>Tone: Preachy and patronizing to the point of being irritating. <BR>Message: \\"Follow your dreams\\". How deep, and original.<BR>Further Peeve: Coelho encourages men to follow their dreams, while a woman's destiny is to await her man (\\"She never asked you to stay because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man\\" - p. 126). This is not taken out of context. Throughout the book, the whole \\"follow your dreams\\" motto is limited to male protagonists.  <br />Don't be duped by the 'warm fuzzy feeling' Coelho tries to leave you with. This book is as deep as a puddle.(...)
B00005JMEW|5.0|The movie barely made it into 5 stars according to me, obviously. It is made seemingly different than other motion pictures, and I would have changed at least one thing in the movie- but I can't give that away.<br />This movie is action packed with a twist of laughter that one can't get away from. Buy it, rent it, borrow it, either way this movie is a must see. If you like an action movie with a hook, then this one will sure to keep you clued to your TV.
0312995423|3.0|This book was not horrible but the facts and details it contained really felt like they had been &quot;dumbed down&quot;.<BR>This book feels like it is destined to become a &quot;made for T.V. movie.&quot;  Oh well, perhaps it will have some interesting footage of Spain!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I fail to understand how this movie got so much euphoria around it. The movie is incredibly slow moving, no well filmed, and just plain out boring. ITs the type of movie to watch when you're really depressed and just feel moping about. OK, so the acting might be good, but i mean, whats a movie without a plot?<br />Lost in Translation was terrible.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Oh man! Listening to it right now... Not one song is bad. All of it so powerful. Definitely beats out the Gladiator Soundtrack! This music makes my imagination fly! If you like Hans Zimmer, then Klaus Badelt is your man! This ties with Con-Air as my favorite soundtrack.
B000059MEK|5.0|Honestly, I tend to like house and think this sort of techno is good to listen to but not good music.  However, this Daft Punk album is undisputedly fun to listen/dance to, and actually a very skillfully done blend.  My favorites are Veridis quo-meaningfully melodic- and Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger-insane robot voice
B0000DD7LB|4.0|First off,I'm 16yr old male.I've always enjoyed Britney's music.She always just a lotta fun to watch and listen to.Then she made an artistic move with amazing,unique Neptunes(which have becaome a little too mainstream lately).With &quot;IN THE ZONE&quot; she's still growing artistically,but slowly.I didn't like this CD at first,now it's one of my favorite albums from 2004.This CD is actually a lot of fun to listen to,you'll enjoy it.There's some great uptempo dance hits('Toxic''Showdown'Brave New Girl').Haunting and emotional ballads('Everytime''Shadow').Hip-hop beated tracks like R.Kelly's pimpin' 'Outrageous,' and YingYang Twins 'Boom Boom.'I think the tracks that adults will favour are Moby's fabulous 'Early Morning' and impressive 'Touch of my Hand'(which are 2 of my favorites).She's written more on this album then her previous three and her writing isn't bad at all.I just think that because of her smoking her vocals are a bit rusty.Overall this CD is enjoying and I personally like it a lot.
B00013RC9I|4.0|this pretty much continues on the &quot;robots in love&quot; theme of &quot;10,000 hz legend&quot; and shows very little of the clubby synth funkiness of &quot;moon safari.&quot;  i really don't understand the reviewers that are hearing the opposite.  more beck vocals could seamlessly fit on on &quot;talkie walkie&quot; whereas they'd have no place on &quot;moon safari.&quot; highlights for me are &quot;run&quot; which sounds like a combination of radiohead head's &quot;kid a&quot; repititive chime songs and one of air's robot love songs, and the electronic minimalist-inspired &quot;mike mills.&quot;  overall, it's a little more catchy and infectious than &quot;10,000 hz legend&quot; but it lacks the absorbing quality of &quot;moon safari.&quot; and bigger picture for me is that this confirms &quot;moon safary&quot; will always be the band's best effort.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I'm so glad this movie is fimally on DVD. I loved it when I first saw it as a child. I hadn't seen it in several years and loved watching it again when I bought the DVD. I'm glad I now have a copy to share with my children.
6305508550|5.0|If you've ever worked in a corporate environment, Office Space'll have you cracking up and peeing your pants! It's one of those kind of silly movies that tells so much truth that you can't help but laugh. <br />Definitely a hit... a great gift for grads starting out in the &quot;real world&quot;, and for the seasoned veteran of the corporate world.
B000000OAN|5.0|The first time I heard this CD....I picked it up at the library on vinyl.  Didnt really pay much attention to it until years later when i really started getting into Queen.  Especially the re-issue of Bohemian Rhapsody for the film Wayne's World.  Afterwards, I set out to search out a copy of this CD and finally obtained a copy of it on CD<br />1. Death On Two Legs - 9/10<BR>Good start to this CD.  Notice the chords at the beginning and you'll hear the 'Psycho Theme'<br />2. Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon - 9/10<BR>Very nice follow-up to Death On Two Legs.  <br />3. I'm In Love With My Car - 7/10<BR>Good Song<br />4. You're My Best Friend - 9/10<BR>Another great song.  <br />5. '39 - 8/10<BR>The journey continues w/this track<br />6. Sweet Lady - 9/10<br />7. Seaside Rendezvous - 9/10<BR>Along the same lines as Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon.  <br />8. The Prophet's Song - 10/10<BR>Definitely Paints a dark picture much like Death On Two Legs.  Especially the voices which were layered over each other during the recording of this track.  Try listening to this one through a set of headphones<br />9. Love Of My Life - 9/10<BR>Soft waltz like track<br />10. Good Company - 8/10<BR>Good track<br />11. Bohemian Rhapsody - 10/10<BR>One Of the best tracks on this CD.  Of course re-issued for Wayne's World.  This song is what inspired me search out more Queen CDs.  It all started with Bohemian Rhapsody.  And then i just had to get a copy of We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions.  <br />12. God Save The Queen - 9/10<BR>Nice Ending to this classic CD.  Queen's rendition of England's  National Anthem.
B0001I55OC|3.0|Time-travellin yarn about a group of modern day students who travel back to 1357 France to save their history professor. After becoming quickly embroiled with bloodthirsty knights, the bubonic plague, and a full-fledged war, the movie sets itself up to be a reasonable attempt at the already overdone time traveling theme. Unfortunately, despite the pedigree of the Michael Crichton bestseller on which it was based, the movie rapidly becomes bland and predictable, and too reliant on the viewers willing suspension of disbelief. Suffering from a surprisingly weak script (considering the book for a moment) and fairly average performances the movie struggles to really get going which is a shame. Although the representation of a war torn Middle Ages Europe is visually impressive, the rest of it just gets rather numbing, and one feels that the movie was deservedly chewed by the critics after it's cinematic release last year. Paul Walker (The Fast &amp; the Furious) may wish to forget that he picked this movie as a vehicle to catapult his growing stardom, as only his most ardent fans will find much to shout about. Very Disappointing.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Hollywood is well known for its ability to mangle perfectly good stories but this one seems to set the bar even lower that usual. If you've read Michael Crichton's delicious novel, from which the title (but little else) of this flick was stolen you'll probably start thinking of spending your time more productively sometime during the first 3 minutes - not counting all of the FBI warnings of course. But being a glutton for punishment I watched it all the way through. <br />Crichton's novel is beautifully worked out with lots of historical & scientific information, decent character development and plenty of action. The screenplay, by Jeff Maguire thoroughly butchers, or to put it more charitably - ignores 90% of this. In fairness though one doesn't know if this is Maguire's fault or his being under orders from the higher-ups at Paramount that insist that scripts be crafted for imbeciles. In any event the end result is a never-ending series of fights & battles, all accompanied by a constant low-frequency rumble (is this supposed to be the scary bit?) that rarely lets up. With all of the slashing, burning & fighting you would think that Maguire - or director Richard Donner (it's tough to know whom to credit for some of these inspirations) would have found a spot for the joust that Chris gets himself involved in - a hilarious bit (in the book of course) - that would have been a relief from the rest of this dribble. But nooooooo, this film takes itself very seriously (ah ha! THAT'S why we have the low rumble going! Serious, foreboding) - no laughing matters here. Another bit that was needlessly changed was how the heroes back at the lab dealt with Doniger. It was a (dare I say) cute, ironic manner of fixing him that would bring a smile to most faces.<br />As to the acting: Well, what can I say? Do you blast the actors for an inane script that they're hired to read? How many times can you say \\"Oh my God!\\" before your audience begins rolling their eyes? The girls are cute,the boys have the required look of today. I WAS taken aback by the total absence of any sex scenes. I mean Richard, you've got two great looking gals and at least a couple of studs who would compliment them beautifully. Surely you could have found 3 minutes somewhere to insert something. Hey that scene where they run into the building that is burned down by the soldiers. Chris & Kate could easily have gotten it on right there. Then they could have made their escape in the nude! Come on man, where's your vision? That little bit could have been excised from the TV version - or better still, left in. Think of the ratings!<br />Then there is the music. Ah yes, the required inspiration of the post-Star Wars flicks. Lots of low brass - for that ominous feel - vamping endlessly on . . . on . . . well, nothing really. \\"Composed\\" - using the word loosely of course - by one Brian Tyler. Is Mr. Tyler a real composer or, as they say in the Hollywood music community, \\"a hummer?\\" An \\"advanced\\" hummer being one that plays around with a synthesizer until he happens upon some suitable noise that the director (or some other genius involved with the flick) approves, and a \\"basic\\" hummer that well, hums. Neither is known for their real ability to write or even read music. But who needs to read music when we can get \\"the computer to do it?\\" The obligatory, quasi marching, meanderings are all there of course. Doesn't matter whether we're in the 21st or 13th century - one size fits all. The state of film music is in such a sorry state. It's easy to lay the blame on incompetent \\"composers,\\" and judging by what we hear, there are quite a few active these days. However, the real blame for the dreck that we so often hear must go to the directors and executives who demand that their own \\"tastes\\" be quenched.<br />So, I'm sorry that Michael Crichton's work was so thoroughly abused, though I suppose he was paid handsomely to stay away from the project. After all, we ARE a civilization that playsby the rules of the almighty dollar.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Starring Ewan McGregor, and Albert Finney in an offbeat story about an estranged son who returns home to visit his dying father, and learns more about him by piecing together the stories he has gathered over the years. In a typical Tim Burton offbeat and colorful way, McGregor (playing his father as a younger man in flashback) helps the son (played by Billy Crudup) by re-creating his father's elusive life in a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts he knows, the result of which is often funny but also beautifully poignant. Burton's quirky signature is ever prevalent here, in this often lavish and wonderfully ridiculous story which raises a few smiles, and leaves the viewer with a warm (if confused) feeling at times.<br />The main thrust of the script is how the initial \\"Fish Stories\\" relayed by the aging man to his son ultimately come to teach him the real truth about the life of the man he has regrettably not known, and the end result is a very entertaining movie for the whole family, or singular audience.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This was a movie I saw for the first time in high school.  I think it is an excellenct movie, especially for the creative arts type of person.  It was created with a wonderful imagination and is a one of a kind type of movie.  Highly recommended for anyone open to interpretation or interested in art of all kinds.
B0000062GE|5.0|This is probably the best cd ever realeased by the group. It has a dark heavy metal aspect not found on their later cd's. The #1 song of course is &quot;drug store&quot; listen and be amazed.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Well, it seems like war out there! Everyone is taking sides, either by claiming Lucas has raped their childhood or by making fun of this statement.<br />I'll try to stay somewhere in the middle because I feel it's time to go past this useless confrontation. First, I love Star Wars, OT and Prequels too. I liked a lot of the SE tweaks (mostly in ESB and some in JEDI), and disliked some of them (the Jabba scene in ANH and Greedo and some of the Mos Eisley sound effects). It's like Phantom Menace. I didn't like Jar Jar or some of the kiddy stuff. But I love the movie in spite of that.<br />I guess G. Lucas has the right to claim these are the movies he wants. I guess people have the right to ask for the editions they like the most. My personal choice would be a mixed release: the SE with a few changes, like the ones I mentioned. That would be MY choice. Since they aren't going for it, I accept these movies for what they are. <br />I saw the originals like 20+ times each before the SE. I loved them and they were a constitutive part of my childhood. And that feeling will be with me forever, with or without Greedo shooting first. Again, I would have preferred Han doing it the old way. But I feel my love for these movies and the great imagination where they came from will be intact with or without this.<br />So I understand and respect Lucas for his bold statement. I don't think it is a spit on the fans. I think it is a personal choice. The one he changed the most is the one he directed. If two years from now he releases the originals on dvd then I will think it was all about money. If he stays true to that statement, then I will respect his choice, like it or not. After all, I can think of a thousand ways to make money with the franchise if he wanted to (sequels, anyone?). <br />My point is, it is alright. Everyone here can see both sides. In like 600 reviews, it has been made clear. So let's start talking about what WILL BE released and not so much about what SHOULD BE. I, for one, don't really like that much the extras. I expected rough footage and deleted scenes. The fourth disc maybe turn out to be great, but it doesn't really impress me that much. On the other hand, the Lowry transfer they are doing for the films means we are going to experience the movies in a way we never even dreamed we could (at home, anyway).<br />Anyway, I will be buying this dvd set. I still have the originals in VHS, which is not that good I reckon. I love the new films too, and think they really add to the whole star wars experience. I am grateful that in my late twenties, I am about to see one final SW movie. I am grateful it isn't over, and when it is, I'll be grateful for the ride. <br />These movies mean that much for me as they mean to you. That's why we are reading all these reviews. Now let's go past these words and watch the films. And be amazed, one more time.
B000002J09|5.0|Just listen to it once.  This album explains itself.  If you are just discovering Led Zeppelin, the band made the world move on from the Beatles, start with Led Zep IV.  You will then want I, II, III....
B00000JPH6|5.0|This is from a woman who is NOT a fan of muppets.  Almost twenty years ago, I and my then 21 month old (who normally didn't sit down long enough to watch commercials let alone cartoons) watched this movie absolutely spellbound on cable.  (My son didn't sit still for another full-length feature until he was 4.) It's full of amazing creatures, heroic adventures and I found the basic ideology innovative.  A must-get for anyone who likes fantasy, adventure tales, still holds a bit of kid in their heart or need their own children to stay out of their hair for an hour and a half!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Two reviewers recently classifying some of these songs as karaoke favorites is a great perspective on how significantly this music has aged, however, many listeners in their 50s and 60s will find some good memories here like She Loves You and I Want to Hold Your Hand.
B000059QY2|4.0|I bought this dvd because, when i saw it for the first time (like 10 ten years ago) was the best sung version and the cast was superb. My favorites are the direction of Chailly (i find it great, dinamic and precise), the voice of Pavarotti (ONLY the voice, the acting sucks) especially singing my favorite aria \\"possente amor mi chiama\\", and giving a high D that i liked much. Now, i prefer the on-stage versions, so i don't like this DVD anymore. But i consider that this could be, in some way, a referencial version about what Rigoletto is musically...
B000002UAU|3.0|The list of albums from this era that have stood the test of time better than this is simply too lengthy to mention.  Maybe it sounded good at one time but there is better 1960s music than this.
B0001Z53CY|4.0|First off Eminem is by far one of the top lyricists in the game and the only one that even comes close is Canibus and we all know it even the haters. Second issue Bizarre never claimed to be Biggie because he's not even comparible and he knows it!<BR>As for the D12 World album it is not as good as Devils Night but worth copping the lyrics are pretty tight, don't let the hater at the top sway you from this purchase you'd be missing out on a good listen.<BR>There are five lyricists and one smart ass (Bizarre)in the group if your ok with that then you'll like it.<br />P.S. I challenge you to show me one verse the Beastie Boys ever did that would compare to any of Eminem's.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is no doubt, the greatest album of all time. A great mix of Slash's guitar and Axl's voice makes this essential to any true rock n' roll admirer. The album is GNR's best, and you can truly listen to it all the way through over and over again. Trust me, listen just once, and you'll be on the Nightrain never to return.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I appreciate the set very much, but I'll leave it to others to express opinions on the 4 movies.<br />I regret that my relatively new, near-top-of-the-line Pioneer player encounters a fatal error at the layer change in both versions of Alien. I find it interesting that the layer change is at the same point in the dialogue in both versions, which ends up being in different chapters and times because of the different elements of the 2 versions of the movie.<br />I could get around the problem by pressing fast forward (scan) just before the layer change (after identifying it) and bypassing the &quot;change.&quot; This is weird, too: why should the player be able to &quot;skip&quot; the layer change and continue successfully if I scan, but it can't survive the layer change as it exists on the disc (#1 of 9)?<br />As usual with a layer change, there's a brief freeze, with &quot;SEARCH&quot; displayed on my DVD player. Only instead of the movie continuing, at that point I get a blue (i.e., no-disc-playing) screen that simply says DVD in the upper left. Restarting the disc is necessary. This is a real drag.<br />Further, disc #4 (the supplemental disc for Aliens) has problems in following the navigation option of going by Pre-Production, Production &amp; Post-Production organization. The menu broke up digitally after the first level, with some submenus being black and causing me to guess what I was selecting. Eventually I stumbled into &quot;nexting&quot; between elements and ended up watching everything. Still, out of 9 discs, 2 have problems. I didn't ask to exchange the set because I don't have time to watch the 9 discs all over again (yes, I watched every single item, including still frames, except for some of the original screenplays). And, as I said, I can see all the material now that I've learned the tricks of how to do it.<br />I'm glad I have the set and glad I watched it all. I just wish I had the peace of mind knowing that all the discs are in perfect condition.
B00018D44U|1.0|PLEASE TELL ME THIS ALBUM IS A JOKE.  MUSIC IS BORING AS HELL. HER SINGING IS BORING AS HELL.  THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS BORING AS HELL.  CANNOT BELIEVE SHE WON SO MANY GRAMMYS.  I'D RATHER LISTEN TO ALICIA KEYS AT LEAST SHE'S CREATIVE AND TRIES SOMETHING...THIS CD CONTAINS THE SAME SONG, STYLE, AGAIN AND AGAIN.  <BR>COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I bought 3 of her albums. Yes she can sing but she is not using all of her vocal abilities at all! Its all about image and shockery. I think the reason why her latest album has gone bad is<br />because she has been making some real stupid decisions and perhaps has pushed aside those who were being protective of her as well as their counsel-perhaps her parents. The MTV kiss so grossed me out and saddened me that I broke all of the CD's I have ever bought of her. She really does not care about her base fans and I don't see the need for her to be continually slutty.<br />I am sure that most that buy her albums are men. I am not surprised that her albums do not sound like music. The music has stopped after her<br />3rd CD.
B000148KK2|1.0|After so much hype about Dianna Krall from newspapers and magazines I decided to forego my collection of Kitty Margolis's latest CD and try Krall out.  Well all I can say is that she might look &quot;pretty&quot;...but she sure can't sing for the life of her.  She sings like she just woke up from a 1,000 year sleep.  Her music is the worst I've heart from &quot;Jazz&quot;...by the way this isn't jazz~<br />Jazz has certain pezzaz that gets you either humming or tapping you feet....Krall's music had me sleeping in 5 minutes.<br />and believe me I tried listening to it again and again...but its total elevator music (and the worst kind too).  If you want JAZZ GO LISTEN TO ELLA FITZGERALD, BIILIE HOLIDAY...CARMEN MCRAE, ETC..IF YOU WANT MODERN JAZZ INTERPRETERS, LISTEN TO DIANNE REEVES, KITTY MARGOLIS, OR MS. PATTI AUSTIN.<br />SAVE YOUR EARS....BEWARE...VERY BEWARE OF THIS AWFUL CD.
B00012QM9K|5.0|Hey Maxhazard, chill out, M R Hocker was only expressing an opinion. You might not like it but keep your arrogant head on!<BR>Maybe he wasn't aware of the situation over there-here we can use PAL or NTSC films on our multi region players. Do try not to be such a tool.
B00007LTIA|5.0|essential prog rock.  2 cd's and 4 long trippy songs
B000002L9M|4.0|Remember the year 1986 in the music industry and if you have some memory you will notice that not much happened over that years. Well, with this album was for Depeche Mode the beginning of a series of fantastic recordings. Martin Gore always says that he pretty much like everything DM put out since Black Celebration. The song itself and the whole album represents a lot to the dark community. I could split the album in two pieces:<BR>1- The ballads (all sang by Mr. Gore)<BR>- A question of lust: Great song, I did not like much the video for this song, but Martin's lyrics are amazing.<BR>-Sometimes: I would not be fair if I say this was another song in the album, it's a very simple song, with no additional production because the song was good as it was, there's anything else to say about it.<BR>-It doesn't matter II: It was great to listened to Martin performing this song again on the Exciter tour, this time an acoustic version with Peter Gordeno in keyboards. <BR>-World full of nothing: Another song Martin performed in the Excited tour (I think it was in Germany). My favourite ballad from Black celebration.<BR>2-The &quot;dark songs&quot;: The opening song is a classic nowadays. If you say Black Celebration you say Depeche Mode. What can I say? The song was inspired by that time and the Germany of the eighties (Martin lived in Berlin in the mid eighties), but it's a song with no time or place.<BR>-Fly on the windscreen:&quot;Death is everywhere&quot;: I remember the version from the Devotional tour of this song, what a performance! In these kind of songs you see the touch of Gareth Jones, Daniel Miller and of course Alan Wilder.<BR>-Stripped: the first single, another classic. &quot;Let me see you stripped down to the bones&quot;. Say no more.<BR>-Here is the house: I listened to the demo of this song and the album version is very similar. The song was good from the beginning so why change it?<BR>-Dressed in black, New dress: two more dark songs, I prefer not to makeany comment about the second one.<BR>-But not tonight: soundtrack from the film &quot;Modern girls&quot;. It's really good to play this song when you are driving in your car at night. It's a very optimistic song to me. It's a good decision that band made by including this song to the album, it was originally a b-side.
B00009Z574|4.0|One of the extra tracks:  conuntriside, has one of the most memorable bass lines that chris squore ever wrote.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I've been a fan of No Doubt for about four years now, and they're the best.<br />Intro - 10/10 - Though it's only 27 seconds long, it's still a pretty good opener.<br />Hella Good - 9/10 - Everytime I hear this song, I imagine myself in a club, the only lights shining are the strobe lights.  No one is sitting down or lounging.  And during the chorus, everyone jumps up and down.<br />Hey Baby - 10/10 - ALWAYS fun to dance to.  The video is awesome too.  I love the way in the beginning, the words Hey Baby comes out of Gwen's and Adrian's mouths, like the catepillar from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.<br />Making Out - 9/10 - Great song to make out to. ;) =P<br />Underneath it All - 10/10 - I could listen to this song for HOURS when it rains.  Lie on my bed, curtains open and watch the rain fall as this song plays.<br />Detective - 10/10 - One of my favorites.  I could imagine how the video could go with this song.  Gwen is the detective, checking up on her boyfriends: Tom, Tony, and Adrian, seeing them with other girls.  But, the thing is, they're cheating on her with others while she's cheating on them with each other.  It's more elaborate in my mind than that, but that's the gist of it.<br />Don't Let Me Down - 10/10 - A very good song to listen to when you're just feeling good. =)<br />Start the Fire - 10/10 - Another one of my favorites.  It's another good song to dance to.<br />Running - 10/10 - I love the way the song starts out.  Sounds like a video game.  It's another good rainy day song.<br />In My Head - 9/10 - Actually quite a depressing song.  Especailly, with the gun shot at the end. =(<br />Platinum Blonde Life - 10/10 - I just could see a video for this song.  Gwen dressed like Joan Jett, standing on a jukebox, hold a chain as she sang.<br />Waiting Room - 10/10 - I have no idea what to say about this song.  It's kinda weird, but good.<br />Rock Steady - 10/10 - A great way to end this CD.  I love this song.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|This band(along with the Hives,the Darkness, Stripes, Kings of Leon, Strokes and Vines)are the only true rockers we have in this age of Linkin Stinkin and Limp Rock. Most bands these days swear by fast rapping, power chords and techno flavored beats and lets not forget how they all love to whine about life. Thats why when bands release albums such as these that its a godsend. Compared to Sticky Fingers and Led Zeppelin's self titled it doesnt hold a flame but when you look at all the other manufactured noise that people deem as rock these days its simply great. Jet have also not forgoten that its rock AND roll, most bands just favor fuzzy power chords and a few beats and dub it rock and then you wonder what ever happened to the roll part. No swinging beat or foot tapping rythms. This record thankfully doesnt have that problem. Most of the upbeat numbers have a great beat and swing to them. Its also noticable that Jet have done their homework b/c comparisons of styles leads one to think of the Stones whom Jet proudly flaunt as their main influence. Another great thing to come about with these bands is their rejection of modern technology. Jack White in particular deserves some regonition for recording his latest release Elephant on two track with no assistance from computers. He obviously knows that many of rock's epic masterpieces werent drowned in computers and studio gimmicks. If you are new to this band and you purchased the cd and enjoyed it, check out the Stones albums Sticky Fingers and Let It Bleed for an even better rock and roll experience.
B0001N1RU8|1.0|As a Diana Krall fan and an Elvis fan all I can say is what were they thinking? I could have written better songs than this. I bought it the morning it came out with huge anticipation, and I think I will find out if there is any way they can recycle cd's because it is just going to collect dust on my shelf otherwise. Too bad because I have never in my life been excited enough about an album to actually go out the day it is released and buy it. MAYBE  I will find someone who will appreciate to give it to, but I doubt it. If this album does well, it is proof that a name can take you a LONG way. If this was a debut album for a new artist, it would be laughed right out of the business and off the charts. Diana does a great job once again of name dropping. What could Elton possibly have to do with this album? That's why I was so surprised to see Elvis being called Declan.
B000002UD0|5.0|Any one who enjoys the genius of John Lennon will enjoy this album.<br />Ignore the naysayers who compare this album to his other work and criticise it because it is not the same.  It is not the same because John did not want it ot be the same.  It has deep background and heavy production because John wanted it that way.<br />The ultimate artist, with a mind of his own, John created this album exactly the way that he wanted it.  If that does not appeal to some, then they do not understand John Lennon and his genius...<br />Buy it, listen, really listen, and enjoy...
0743454529|5.0|Jodi Picoult has masterfully covered yet another controversial topic in her novel &quot;My Sister's Keeper.&quot; This time, young Kate is diagnosed with a severe form of leukemia. Her parents then have a baby, Anna, who is genetically selected to be a close donor match for Kate. From her birth onward into her early teens, Anna is called upon to undergo increasingly invasive and dangerous procedures to provide blood, bone marrow, and other tissues to sustain her older sister's life. Now, a kidney is needed, and Anna brings a lawsuit against her parents, claiming the right to her make own decision about what medical procedures can be performed on her. Anna's mother Sara, an attorney, decides to represent her own daughter Kate at the trial.<br />There are some very difficult questions raised in this story. Does Anna have the obligation to risk her own health to save her sister?  Do her parents have the right to make the medical decisions about Anna's donor role, and where should their loyalties lie? Where is the fine line between what is legal and what is ethical in a situation like this? There seem to be no right or wrong answers here, and the ensuing trial recounts all the physical, moral, psychological, and familial struggles that are brought to bear on the issue. Picoult paints a powerfully emotional picture of a family in turmoil. She adds additional tension to the story through brother Jesse, whose drug taking and criminal tendencies add even more burdens to an already overwrought situation. The story also includes the love/hate relationship between Anna's lawyer and her legal guardian.<br />The narrative switches from character to character so that the reader hears the voices of each family member, as well as that of Anna's lawyer and of the legal guardian appointed to watch out for her interests. Sara's narrative includes flashbacks on the history of Kate's illness, Anna's role in providing medical support, and the toll that the constant threat of Kate's death takes on the family. There are several shocking twists to the plot that make the story even more riveting. This is Picoult's best book yet!<br />Eileen Riebacktakes on the family.

B000001E7T|1.0|I know it's not me, but I found nothing on this CD even remotely listenable. This is horrible crap. Apparently, those who deem it great and all must have all of their taste in their mouth. After I listened to my copy I am now using it as a coaster. Works better that way.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|I have been a long time fan of EC since the Yardbirds, and have enjoyed many of his contributions to rock, especially those made with Cream, Blind Faith, and Derek &amp; the Dominoes.<br />  However, although I realize he is regarded as an elder statesman of the electric guitar, there are FAR better examples of blues guitarists worthy of carrying Robert Johnson's torch - John Hammond, Jr. for example, who has been doing it for years! Clapton's recent output (other than a few blues &quot;tributes&quot;) is pretty much the same recycled commercial stuff he started with &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; (one of his faves, tellingly enough). To my ears, most of &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; is a cluttered mess - the stark, haunting beauty of the originals is gone, replaced by cacophonous, competing riffery.<br />  I think Clapton needs to get together with a few REAL young blues musicians out there so they can teach the ol' dog some new licks...
B0001I55OC|4.0|This movie has been panned by quite a few Michael Crichton purists.  Well, I'm a Michael Crichton fan myself, but I thought that this was a pretty good movie.  Not perfect, but then again neither was the book.  But very thought-provoking (like most Crichton science fiction novels) with a skillful use of science and scientific speculation.<br />The story is simple enough (no spoilers here).  A limited form of time travel has accidentally been discovered, and a leading scientist has become trapped in the past--specifically A.D. 1357 France.  A rescue team is formed to go back and get him.  But when they arrive, they discover that the era they have entered is a violent, tumultuous one, and they quickly lose control of their mission and are swept into the violent world around them.  More would be telling, but this is a pretty good yarn.  It also avoids most of the pitfalls of other time travel stories, i.e. the paradoxes and the incredulity that arises from them.<br />The book did an incomparably better job explaining the time travel technology (in Crichton's peerless fashion) than did the movie, which I thought gave this component of the story short shrift.  However, the book got pretty bogged down about midway through, while the movie maintained better continuity of story.  Further, I thought the movie ending was incomparably better than that of the book, and was in fact beautifully done.<br />The special effects in the movie are not bad either.  The catapults, the Greek Fire, and the battle scenes were very well done, and quite realistic.  They managed to convey the central concept of the story--that this was a violent place and time, a time of war and conquest.  I thought that the acting was pretty OK, if not exceptional.<br />Overall, quite a good movie; one that I'll watch more than once.
B00005QZWI|4.0|The FotR soundtrack is near the top of the list of my favorite movie soundtracks, along with The Two Towers and  Whale Rider. The only complaints I have about it are that some of the pieces are obviously different versions than are heard in the movie, which would be alright except that some are truncated, such as the Bridge Of Khazad-Dum track. Obviously all the music in the movie can't be included on one cd, but it's just a little dissapointing. Otherwise, I highly recommend it as one of the best movie scores ever.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|Finally, a good hiphop album! Track after track of great beats and lyrics.  The crew is back!
B00005A46T|5.0|Everyone on here bashing Slipknot because they got big is a joke.  So what?  They still sound like Slipknot and that's whats important.  Everyone knocking the talent (except the drummer as I think we all agree hes wicked), is missing the whole point.  As a musician I appreciate talent, but as someone who likes to blow off steam once in awhile I also appreciate the atmosphere that certain bands project.  That's slipknot.  When I listen to them I feel like motor revving at 15,000 RPMS.  If you want talent, go listen to Tool.. If you want to fill the void left by a departing Pantera, Slipknot is the one to do that.
0385510438|1.0|I was convinced by a friend to start reading books from John Grisham. I haven't read that many, but this one was AWEFUL.  It was sooo drawn out, and basically a waste of my time.<br />However, I must say that I liked &quot;The Summons&quot;, &quot;The Testament&quot;, and so far I'm liking &quot;The King of Torts.&quot;
B00009V7T2|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I like John Cage, Rush, Gabriel-era Genesis, Opeth, and Bjork as much as the next guy. I like that relatively popular musicians are trying to come up with ways to make the average Joe raise an eyebrow and say &quot;What the heck?&quot;  On the other hand, I honestly think this CD doesn't live up to what it wants to be.  The vocals stay in that upper register and are always delivered with as much force as it can project in the &quot;climax moments&quot; and the effect-laden band noodle about however they feel like.  <br />To the more open-minded ear, this hodgepodge of ADD-induced cut-and-paste songwriting is bliss to zonk out to.  Either my mind isn't so open these days or what started off as ambitious and grin-inducing quickly devolved into a bad musical interpretation of &quot;Piper At The Gates of Dawn&quot; meets &quot;Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; halfway through.  And, well, big words don't always make good lyrics.  Big words wailed with poor enunciation (or mixing) make for unintentionally hilarious moments.  Their subject isn't exactly much to write home against, either. If the 90s taught us anything, it's that rarely anything positive can come out of heroin use.<br />This is interesting music, don't get me wrong. Sometimes trying new things is its own reward, and did they ever try.  I just wish that someone came clean with the band and told them to write different songs instead of different facets of the same template.  I can only take so much of soft verse, loud chorus, jam, loud chorus.
B00009TB5G|1.0|It is a bad story line.  It is boring.  Too much action= boring.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful book.  Don't let anyone tell you it's not.  A review in here got me thinking though.  They said there is no such thing as books that are better than others because it's all subjective.  This person is wrong, simple as that.  Certain books are not literary towers because people have said &quot;wow! amazing!&quot; people say that about Harry Potter!  I mean really!  What distinguishes a book and makes it &quot;better&quot; than others, is if it's around in fifty, one hundred years.  Pride and Prejudice has done this.  It is &quot;better&quot; than other books.
B0000009SY|5.0|First off, if you are a drummer, you must own this record.  Vinnie Caliauta invents some of the most ingenious grooves ever recorded.  Check out the absolute madness at the end of &quot;Keep it Greasy.&quot;  <br />That said, this is an extremely enjoyable record in every way.  &quot;Joe's Garage&quot; is Zappa's Pop, concept album.  It follows our hero Joe from teen rocker to washed up criminal, trying to cope with an Orwellian society in which music is illegal.  The story is stream of conscious and extremely silly at times.  It is a funny record, but let's forget about that.<br />It is also an extremely well-written and well played collection of music that deserves major attention.  Frank Zappa is not just a sardonic, iconoclast rock star; he is one of the great American composers.  He is also my favorite guitarist.  Joe's last imaginary guitar solo, &quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay&quot; is simply beautiful and brings a touch of real sentiment to an otherwise completely irreverent record.
B0000D96NW|5.0|This cd is pure metal at its finest. This cd will blow you away, and keep you listening to it over and over again. If you are a fan of Lamb of God, Slayer or metal in general you'll love this cd trust me.(I would say metallica, but you'll realize how weak metallica has become in the presence of Through the Ashes of Empires.) Overall just pick up this cd and find out for yourself, Machine Head is back and better than ever!
0385510438|2.0|The book tells a good story, with some thrilling parts. However, don't expect &quot;The Runaway Jury&quot;, &quot;The Firm&quot; or &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;. This book is nowhere close to the quality of Grisham's other books. Most of the story is uneventful, without the action levels we are used to.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Jaimee Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence star in this horrfying movie about a Pyschotic man named Michael Myers. As a child Michael Myers brutally stabbed his sister which resulted in her death on Halloween night. Years later, On the same night Michael Myers escapes from the instute where he is currently kept and starts on a brutal and most frightning killing spree. Eventually as the night wears on Michael Myers reaches a house inhabbited with a group of teenagers having sex and drinking only to brutally slaughter each and everyone. Jaimee lee Curtis is the last victim to be chased by Michael Myers, Somehow though she escapes her fate on a whim as a police man (Pleasence) arrives at the house and shoots Michael in the chest 6 times...Only to find out that Myers was unaffected and is again on the loose...Over all this is one of the scariest and most delightfuly entrancing movies I have ever seen and I am sure that someday this will become a classic.
0385510438|4.0|My favorite Grisham novels are, in this order:  THE FIRM, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, and this one, THE LAST JUROR.  As you can see, I'm somewhat eclectic in my tastes, and this may be the reason for liking three completely different books by the same author.  But what I like is not so much Grisham's plots, but his writing style, for even when he changes, there's something there that rings true--some Grishamness that comes to the surface.  Perhaps it's excellent writing, perhaps it the way his characters move through his landscapes of not only geography, but the mind.  For whatever reason I liked this book.  My advice?  Get past the fact that not everything will be a thriller on the level of THE FIRM, and read this book for what it is:  a well-crafted piece of fiction.<br />Also recommended:  BARK OF THE DOGWOOD
B0001ENY6M|5.0|The music was the greatest part of the movie to my opinion; John Debney made a great work with an Azerbaijanian instrument of duduk and also using Azerbaijanian folklore for his music.<br />(...)

B00020QIKY|5.0|Awesome cd, but the song &quot;My Band&quot; has been getting played like every 30 mins. or so and it is already getting annoying. All and all I would buy the cd again, it is well worth it because the song &quot;My Band&quot; is actually one of the weakest songs on the cd. So go with what ya feel but if ya like D12 this is a must have cd.
0440238609|5.0|Not the book, you fantastic God Squad members - particularly the ones who think they are undercover by saying \\"I'm not very religious but...\\".<br />Christiane Hendriksen displays her ignorance by refusing to believe the church would \\"cut off the genitals of children\\" (at least that was what she was trying to say): refuse to believe all you want - it's still true.  I particularly like the line of that fine argument since it's probably the one the God Squad will use on an unbeliever like me.<br />Stefanos Erini does a great impression of Gollum - unless of course it's the royal \\"we\\" he's talking about, my precious.<br />Best of all though, are those who hate the book for it's lack of factual basis or evidence for Pullman's theory.  As opposed to the Bible which, co-incidentally, is far more poorly written and full of plot holes.<br />Those who are offended by this \\"anti-religious\\" (sic) propoganda betray their underlying insecurities in their own faiths - when was the last time you saw an atheist or agnostic scream and rant that the Bible was published?  Hmm?  That's because they can cope with those who have different beliefs.<br />As for the book not being suitable for children until they reach the right age not to be sucked in by its \\"brain-washing\\" potential, I completely agree.  But, while we're at it, I think we also need to ban them from reading the Bible in that case.  Surely that's fair?<br />Bottom line is, keep your reviews based on the creativeness of the story and the skill with which it is told.  Whether you agree or disagree with the author's take on religion is totally irrelevant.  <br />Idiots.

He has a deformity but no one is able to describe it.<BR> I belivie that every one has a good and a bad side.  One side is shown a lot more than the other side.  I do not understand why someone would try to separate their good from their bad.  If it were possible, many people would try to separate their to sides, and if they did, then if our bad side is like that of Mr. Hyde, there would be a lot crimes to day.
B000002J2F|4.0|I really don't think this website should be used as a discussion forum, but I feel that \\"trickoftail\\"'s last \\"review\\" was more or less a response to my post, so I'm going to reply here just this once.<br />Smallcreep's Day is a nice album, but there really isn't anything \\"progressive\\" about it (not that that necessarily matters.)  A Curious Feeling I agree is excellent, and possibly the best Genesis solo album overall.  Not sure if it's \\"progressive\\" or not, but it's still wonderful.<br />My bottom line is that some Genesis fans have too narrow of a definition of \\"progressive\\".  They seem to think it's all about the long compositions and grandiose arrangements and keyboard and guitar solos, etc. etc...but progressive music is really more about *attitude*, and the willingness to creatively incorporate various styles and ideas into rock music.  At this point in their career (1980), Genesis was still doing that. To say that Genesis \\"sold out\\" at this point in their career is simply wrong.  \\"Selling out\\" means to compromise your standards and principles solely for the purpose of making money.  Genesis had always been writing pop songs and trying to get songs on the radio ever since their heyday - so if songs like Misunderstanding, Turn It On Again, Please Don't Ask etc. are examples of selling out, then you might as well say songs like Happy The Man, I Know What I Like, Counting Out Time, Carpet Crawlers etc. are sellouts too.  Even if they are somewhat accessible, they certainly aren't formatted for Top 40 radio.<br />Another reason this album isn't a sellout is because it dares to take risks and move Genesis' music into a different direction, while still retaining some of their classic qualities (something which Yes and ELP failed to do nearly as well.)  It seems to me like a lot of Genesis fans would have rather had them keep repeating their old ideas over and over again than actually PROGRESS.<br />Case in point: the Spot The Pigeon EP.  Inside And Out has to be theMOST overrated Genesis song ever.  That song is simply a pale imitation of PG-era Genesis, it just takes a bunch of the hallmarks from that era (the 12-string acoustic section, the fast instrumental section, the keyboard solo, the guitar solo) and throws them together in a diluted fashion without adding much of anything new.  On the other hand, there's Pigeons, which is a much more creative song with a lot of clever ideas.  But because it doesn't have the obvious hallmarks of classic Genesis or \\"progressive\\" music, people think it's crap.  And that's why lumping early Genesis in the same category with Yes/ELP/King Crimson etc. is doing them a major disservice.  Sure, they share some of the same elements as those bands, but all in all, Genesis' music is much closer to that of experimental pop bands like the Beatles.  \\"Pop\\" and \\"progressive\\" are NOT opposites, and bands like the Beatles and Genesis proved that.<br />Also, FWIW, Steve Hackett did NOT try to get the rest of Genesis to let him write with the band - he wanted to write songs on his own and have Genesis perform them.  Genesis didn't want to do things that way, so he left.  It had little or nothing to do with artistic differences.  And if you think there isn't any \\"variety\\" in Genesis music after he left, you're not listening very closely.<br />So again, my bottom line is that Genesis' music shouldn't be judged on whether or not it conforms to some prescribed definition of \\"prog.\\"  It should be judged (like all music) on honesty, originality and inspiration, and as far as I can tell, there's plenty of that on Duke, as I've shown in my last review.  I can agree that by the time of IT and WCD, Genesis did become more caught up in the pumping-out-hit-after-hit routine, so maybe the term \\"sellout\\" is more accurate for that period.  But not for Duke.<br />If trickoftail or anyone else feels like responding to this, feel free to e-mail me at jhill524@hotmail.com...I'm sure most readers would rather we keep this off-site.
B000002I4S|5.0|My purpose here is not to simply add more superlatives to this legendary album's justly proud reputation -- it's everything and more that has been written about it of a praiseworthy nature; and you'll find plenty of praise here in these reviews (see especially the insightful words from Samuel Chell). But there remains one rather 'technical', and curiously long-lived misconception about GIANT STEPS which, as a serious student of jazz and avid music collector, myself (I have virtually all of Coltrane's impressive recorded output), I have wanted to correct  for years -- a misunderstanding which, I hasten to add, in NO way diminishes the brilliance and stature of this pivotal milestone in Coltrane's prolific career.     The problem is this: over the years, repeated references (and you'll find some of them in these reviews) to this classic album's being the ultimate representation of Coltrane's famous  'sheets of sound' phase, or technique, are simply mistaken. The so-called 'sheets of sound' effect that so startled early Coltrane audiences, in fact, emerged in his late '50s albums for Prestige -- not yet fully developed in the '56-'57 sides with the early Miles Davis Quintet (not even on that groundbreaking group's final recording, Miles' first for Columbia, 'ROUND ABOUT MIDNIGHT), but very well documented, even dominating, in Coltrane's prolific late '57-'58 period on Prestige, where the best examples of his 'sheets of sound' are to be found.    Technically, 'Trane's much-touted 'sheets of sound' amounted to his simply (!) shifting into a 'higher gear', at slow-to-medium-fast tempos -- essentially, playing more 16th notes (i.e., 4 notes to every beat), instead of relying on the more typical  8th-note orientation (i.e., 2 notes to each beat) of most modern jazz solos from early be-bop onward. Coltrane's solos during this period often used this technique to the point of letting those rapid-fire, 16th-note runs dominate his playing -- giving rise to the description, 'sheets of sound', or, sometimes, the more pejorative (and unjust) charge from critics that he was just 'running scales'. Upon even cursory examination, Coltrane's solos on GIANT STEPS, on the contrary -- despite the prevalence of furious tempos (which should not be confused with how many notes PER BEAT are being played!) -- actually do NOT contain a preponderance of the notorious 16th-note passages. In fact, the relatively spare use of his well-established, '4-to-the-beat' phrases on this 1960 classic might be viewed as one of the more 'unexpected' aspects of this landmark entry in the great Coltrane legacy. His wonderfully agile, complex, and justly famous solos on such pieces as the title track, and even the demonically paced 'Countdown', in fact, consist of predominantly 8th notes; and, while the fast tempos, themselves, of course, may dictate a rapid torrent of notes, they still mostly come at 'only' 2 to the beat -- not the daunting 4 per beat that really define the 'sheets of sound' effect. It may be suggested that the generally fast tempos on GIANT STEPS are largely responsible for the relative absence of 16th-note runs throughout the album (as a practical limitation, even for Coltrane!); yet, it also is true that even the more moderately paced pieces -- normally more conducive to 'sheets of sound' flights -- are relatively free of that effect, compared to Coltrane's previous work on Prestige.    At this album's date, the intense, multi-noted, and profoundly influential explorations that would largely define Coltrane's approach, even to the end, were yet to be applied in still other musical contexts, as this jazz giant's expansive music evolved from the 'interim' Atlantic years into the final, long Impulse! period of cutting-edge experimentation. The initial shock of those earlier 'sheets of sound' would dissipate, and seem 'tame' by comparison -- or, perhaps, just 'inevitable' building blocks in the larger scheme of things ... and the legend would only grow.
B000002GW5|5.0|This is the only Jackson Browne cd I've got and I really don't care if certain fans dismiss it as bland or catchy - everytime I play it (very often by the way) takes me somewhere I'm only while listening to it. Great singing by Browne and a top notch band. It's a very original concept album (Recorded live either on stage, in the tour bus, in hotel rooms and backstage too) about life on the road. <br />Highlights for me include the title track, The Road, Shaky Town and especially Nothing But Time - how moving is Browne's introduction and his performance (On piano and vocals) is unlike anything else you may have heard. The other tracks are great too - listen to the weary and stoned singing on Cocaine, for instance. The only complain I have is that Stay was cut off.<br />All in all, a very emotional and enjoyable album. Get it.

B00008CLOA|5.0|take this. you take any floyd song and you can never have a better one. The ones who dont understand him, should n't listen to it. I feel you would need more maturity than listening to the most popular music that is plain dumb and poinless. Some lunatics who dunt know nuthing abt music come out singing songs and writing reviews.    The message is clear, if you can't take the heat, give it up and stick to black eyed peas, lady gaga or whatever. Don't even come near the masters of music!!!

World War II was a war not to be forgotten and niether will this book when you read it. A little hard to follow however, when you get it, a wonderfully written story. John Hershy gives very factual details of the war, and handles the characters point of view well. He is a genious.

B00005JMEW|3.0|If there is any word to describe my reaction to Kill Bill Vol. 1, it is this: Underwhelmed.<br />Oh, there was plenty to like. Superb cinematography, really nice character and set design, and some very stylish sequences ...<br />... but ultimately I was left shrugging my shoulders and saying, \\"yeah, it was alright.\\" Following this film, I won't make any great effort to see Vol. 2, though I'll watch it if it comes my way.<br />There was a lot of style and gloss and swagger, which is fine, but it was empty style and gloss and swagger. I didn't much care about the story or characters, I didn't find the humor funny, and I never felt drawn into the story or interested to see what happens next. About 45 minutes in I just wanted to see the bloodbath at the end everybody was talking about and be done with it.<br />(Take note, I am not a fan of many of the genres Tarantino was referencing in Kill Bill, so things that would make a fan of Sunday Matinee Kung Fu smile would not do much for me).<br />Still, there were some camera shots that were just fantastic - the car and motorcycles racing through Japan, the long single-shot sequence, the pan over the slaughtered wedding party, among others - and the score and soundtrack was flawless in every way, probably the best yet in a Tarantino film. The action sequences were well choreographed, and the special effects were delightfully campish.<br />Yet in the end I felt a bit empty. Unlike my first viewings of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, when I knew I had just watched something special, Kill Bill Vol. 1 struck me as just ... good. And the hype claims much more than \\"good.\\"<br />Certainly an argument can be made that Vol. I was just the first half of the film, and hence is incomplete. The second half may well put the first in perspective. But this review focuses solely on Vol. I as a standalone film, and as a standalone film, it did not work for me.<br />The film's merits aside, the quality of the DVD was outstanding, with a crisppicture and excellent sound. Techphiles will not be disappointed with the presentation in any way. The extras are sparse, but what is here is solid enough to tide Kill Bill fans over until the Special Edition is released.<br />If you already know you like this movie, purchasing this is a no-brainer - great DVD presentation, good picture, and, well, it's Kill Bill. If you're unsure if you will like this, a rental is recommended before plunking down the cash on a purchase, because for this viewer, the reality did not live up to the hype.
0375760067|1.0|Modern novels can be so pretentious, with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no, it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence, melodrama, and, as the afterword in my edition puts it, &quot;the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.&quot; I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption, it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started, but the crazy, unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters, ever. You learn nothing in the end, except life is cruel and if something can go wrong, it will. Read something else.
630460288X|4.0|Stallone in one of his better roles as a cop frozen in suspended animation as part of a jail sentence.  He is awakened several years later because his arch-nemesis (Wesley Snipes)was also awakened from suspended animation and the pacifist future cops have no clue how to stop him.  Stallone's rough ways do not bode well for those in charge but he is worshipped as a hero by his new partner (Sandra Bullock).  Great exchanges of dialogue and action scenes between Stallone and Snipes.  A great deal of comic relief as old commercial jingles have become popular music and Stallone doesn't know how to use the future bathroom or bond with a future woman (Bullock).
6305508550|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time.  I think anyone who has ever worked in an office will identify with all of the characters.  There are days when I feel that the lead character played by Ron Livingston was based on my life.  I must be &quot;having a case of the Mondays&quot;  I used to work with a guy who insisted on only using his personal antique stapler. If anyone ever finds a hypnotist that can zap me into not knowing I went to work - please find me. Until then, I will continue to arrive late to work, enter through the back door, zone out for an hour pretending to work, and get an actual fifteen minutes of work done every day.  This movie gets funnier every time. Everyone who commutes to work, especially in California, will also identify with the traffic scenes. After seein the movie, I can now at least smile a little thinking about how funny everyday, mundane life can really be.
B000148KK2|5.0|Wow, &quot;The Girl In The Other Room&quot; is a sheer musical delight. Her raw talent shines throughout the entire CD. It's a much better offering than stupid Norah Jones' horrible CD &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; which I had such high expections for. Krall however delivers the goods and she delivers them with incredible heart, soul and of course talent. Brave Diana!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I was pretty disappointed with this film. All the critics raved about this movie, gave it five stars, and touted Bill Murray for Oscar consideration.  So I endured two hours on my couch, watching the DVD. I just didn't see what everyone was raving about. There really is no plot aside from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson wandering aimlessly around their hotel and Tokyo together. Murray is basically playing the same character he has been doing since &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; and &quot;Rushmore&quot;, etc, except he isn't really very funny this time.  I thought Bill Murray was great in &quot;Rushmore&quot;.  Although there are a few funny moments, the overall movie wasn't that funny. I kept waiting for something to really funny to happen but nothing ever did. I was also a bit embarassed about the caricaturish portrayal of Japanese people.  This movie wasn't for me, but apparently some people really loved it.  Go figure.
0679746048|4.0|This book gives a truthful look into the mind of a disturbed young woman who finds herself in a mental hospital due to a struggle with her inner emotions.  Ms. Kaysen makes no effort to sugarcoat the conditions or situations involving her and the other patients at the hospital. Everything she writes is honest and extremely vivid. One account in which we see a frightening and true depiction of a patient's situation is in the chapter entitled, \\"Calais Is Engraved In My Heart.\\" After a girl named Alice Calais has a severe mental breakdown she is sent to maximum security. The other girls go to visit her, and what they find leaves the reader with an unsettling vision of the lives of these young women. Kaysen makes no excuses for herself, or anyone else, she simply tells her story the way it happened. Another aspect of Ms. Kaysen's writing, that separates her from the rest, is her ability to covey abstract thoughts and theories in a very personal way. Using unique metaphors, symbols, and her own experiences, she is able to address such topics as the inner Id, the cause and effect of her condition, and the thin line that divides normality from insanity. In a place that seems so dark and unhappy Kaysen manages to insert light and humor. One of Kaysen's fellow patients, Lisa, while extremely disturbed, is also very witty and sharp. Kaysen herself also has a very humorous side. A weaker point of the novel is that in some cases Kaysen's writing becomes so internal that it seems scattered and is difficult to follow.  Another point that may turn readers away is the extremely graphic and unapologetic accounts of the effects of illness in the hospital.  However, this book was an informative, creative, and groundbreaking piece of literature that is certainly worth reading.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I love Madonna. Shes so powerfull, so emmotional, so sincere in her songs, specially in this album. For me its Madonna peaking with American Life, doing her best work as a result of years of musical and artistic developement and creativity.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|This movie was so fascinating and intelligent. The idea put forth was incredibaly clever. The fact of her judging her patients and claiming that they are &quot;crazy&quot; until she wakes up one day to find herself in their position. The whole movie is about how halle berry unravels the case that has caused her and her patients paranoia.<BR>It is the best movie I have ever seen. It's very meaningful influential and powerful. I would definitly advise you to buy it so you can be inspired, just like i was.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quention Tarantino masterfully blends 70s grindhouse, classic Hong Kong cinema, and Western elements together into a film that is visually and developmentally stunning.  The story itself is simple.  We KNOW that the Bride will kill off everyone, and yet we don't care that she does, we care HOW she does it.  It is this aspect of Tarantino that makes his directorial eye pure genius.  His ability to turn a simple plot and turn it upside down with complexity into it is just incredible.<br />The acting here is top-notch.  Anyone who has ever doubted Uma Thurman's acting need only re-watch the scene where the Bride awakens from her four-year coma and realizes that the baby she was pregnant with is gone.  Her raw emotion and screams of grief display Thurman's abilities as an actor in a film where acting is often limited due to the amount of action.  No one can say that Thurman didn't deserve the Golden Globe nomination after watching this scene.<br />The rest of the group of Deadly Viper Assasains is rounded out with the Vivica A. Fox as the street-smart Vernita Green and Lucy Liu as the cold-faced O-ren Ishii.  Tarantino does a good job at making these highly unlikeable characters sympathetic in the end.  You feel compassion and hatred for them at the same time.  We also see a hint of the two other deadly vipers, the eyepatch toting Elle Driver and Bill's brooding brother Budd, played by Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen.  Their parts are minor, but they serve to set up interesting character arcs for their main spotlight in Vol. 2.  <br />Since Vol. 1 is more action-orientated and Vol. 2 is more storyline-orientated, the general consensus has been that if you enjoy all the action, you won't like the second film.  However, considering that these two films were originally promoted as one until Miramax forced Tarantino to split up the movie due to timing constraints (or else the film would have been about 5 hours long).  However, I found Vol. 1 to be a great start to the KillBill saga, and yes, while it does have more action, the storyline IS there.  This is probably Taratino's greatest work yet, so be sure to check this one out as well as the equally great Vol. 2.
074325144X|5.0|This is one of the most refreshing books of the subject of running I have ever read. I heard the author speak on CNN and was very intrigued by his technical and philosophical running advice. After reading the book, I tried incorporating many of the ideas into my running form. It really seemed to help lift me to a higher level of running right away. I really feel the difference in my stride and agility, as my running seems more fluid now and less mechanical. I would reccommend this book to any beginner, intermediate or advanced runner looking for a new approach to improving their running performance.
B000002KON|5.0|5 stars may seem excessive to some, but for my money, this is one of the best, if not THE best rock album I've ever heard... definitely on a par with The Beatles, The Stones, The Who, etc. In fact, in my opinon, The Kinks are better than all those bands.<br />  Planned as the soundtrack to a television play that never came to pass, Arthur is a tale of broken promises and unfulfilled dreams, seen through the eyes of a middle-aged man who feels betrayed by the country he once loved. It sounds impenetrable, but Ray Davies uses universal themes and catchy melodies to make this material resonate with anyone who has a heart. There are no wasted notes, and no throwaway lyrics: everything is very economical and carefully crafted for maximum effect. The lyrics are intelligent without ever being ponderous or pretentious, and even though it's a \\"concept album\\" every single track stands on its own merit as well.  <br />     \\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\", a damning indictment of war and the British class system, is one of the finest songs the head Kink ever penned, featuring some of his most barbed lyrics: \\"Let them feel that they're important to the cause/ but let them know that they are fighting for their homes / just be sure that they're contributing their own. / Give the scum a gun and make the bugger fight / and be sure to have deserters shot on sight / If he dies, we'll send a medal to his wife.\\" <br />     That song is immediately followed up by the one-two punch of \\"Some Mother's Son\\", probably the most touching anti-war song in rock history, which features a gorgeous middle eight section and some of Ray Davies' most accomplished chord changes to date. Elsewhere, muted desperation gives way to 60's-soaked rock freak-outs like \\"Brainwashed\\" and \\"Australia\\". And that's just the A side! <br />     Flip it over (track 7 on cd) and you'll find the album's centerpiece, \\"Shangri-la\\". Over mournful arpeggiations, Ray Davies practically sighs, rather than sings, heartbreaking lyrics that detail Arthur's plight: he is mired in bills that he can barely pay, trapped in a soul-destroying job, frightened that he'll lose everything, and too numbed to contemplate any of it. Then, just before the listener can slip into quiet resignation along with Arthur, the Kinks jolt us awake with a harrowing bridge section complete with Ray screaming \\"Life ain't so happy in your little Shangri-la!\\"<br />    Humor is also one of the most effective weapons in the Kinks' arsenal, and there's plenty to be found on cuts like \\"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\\" (another study of class relations) and \\"Nothing to Say\\".  <br />    Arthur, the album, didn't do very well at the time of its release, and very much like Arthur, struggled to be heard. It is a testament to the breadth and depth of Ray Davies' vision that time has only amplified the power that lies between the grooves of this extraordinary album. It needs to be amplified, because the power in these songs is sometimes very quiet indeed. \\"Young and Innocent Days\\" sums it up best, as the Kinks long for \\"the way I used to look at life, soft white dreams with sugar-coated outside\\". In reality, sugar coated delights are hidden all over this album, but beneath the sugar is some real food for thought. Stand out tracks include: \\"Victoria\\", \\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\", \\"Brainwashed\\", \\"Shangri-la\\", and \\"Some Mother's Son\\".

055321277X|3.0|I find classics rather confusing. I believe that is just the language of the time that it was written in. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde does have a rather interesting plot line but, like some of the other reveiw topics, it is a very common Horror plot. But I did enjoy the psycological theme of a persons darker side in Dr. Jekyll's experiment.  Yet, this story has become rather cliche and predictable. It just seems as if we already know what is going to happen because this story is so well known.  We read and studied this book in British Literature and will be tested on it. It was a rather good book but I still find classics rather confusing.

No, Eminem rocks, Bizzare rocks, Proof rocks, Kon Artist rocks, Kuniva rocks, and Swift rocks! They are all so great I can barely stop listening to there CD! BUY IT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That's part of the fun, no?<br />Facts:<BR>- Yes, it's over the top, but in a fun way.<BR>- The CSI parody is hilarious.<BR>- It's got fast cars.<BR>- It's well filmed.<BR>- It's sort of retro styled, but in a modern way (?).<BR>- It's got some good fight scenes.<BR>- It's got some good bikini scenes.<BR>- The Angels are HOT!<BR>- That scene with the close up of Cameron Diaz's twirling behind has to be the single-most sexy picture in the history of movie-making.<BR>- And Lucy Liu is of course a fox. Period.<br />Yeah, too bad Bill Murray's not in it, but then Bernie Mac does a good job.<br />This is a good \\"Friday night movie\\". You know? When you've been working all week and you're dog-tired and all you wanna do is crash on the couch with a cold one?<br />That's when you need to watch this movie. It'll perk you right up again.<br />So don't take yourself so seriously (that's how you get lines on your forehead!) and enjoy this piece of entertainment!<br />Amen!

For the FOOL from FT Lauderdale Florida.. retirement capital of the world saying its a horrible cd.. clean out your ears.. anything with Eminem is going to be great, even if it is D12.  Id like to see you try and do better. Im sure Simon Cowell would be all over your a**. Have a great day!  <BR>ps. noone talks about Eminem like that.
B00005A46T|1.0|Firstly the packaging is poor, it's supposed to be dark and scary, to scare all the 12 year old kids who think because they bought an album made by people in masks, jump suits, and put a black ram on their CD, they've made their own personal anarchy. What amazes me the most about Slipknot is they've already released one 'thrash metal' disaster, why bring out the same album twice? Not Original, already been done, just because it sounds aggressive and violent doesnt make it good metal. Heres my runthrough:<br />515 - I swear I've heard this before?<br />People=**** - yes people such as you my friends.<br />Disasterpiece - Now you're telling the truth about the songs.<br />My Plague - Your plague is not so much a plague, more just being crap and producing pieces of wankery such as this.<br />Ah God, I need to stop, getting too angry!<br />All you little 12 year old monsters, open your eyes and buy some good metal music, Tool, Metallica or even try relaxing to some R.E.M or something, JUST NOT THIS!
B00005QDW1|5.0|&quot;Rock Steady&quot; is not as good as &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;.  That doesn't mean that it's a sell out people!  No Doubt have nothing to sell out from!  Tragic Kingdom was a gigantic commericial hit, and Return Of Saturn was critically acclaimed.  So get your facts together!  Anyway,  this album is a pop/reggae/tri hop experiment.  No Doubt doesn't always have to be alternative pop/rock people!  Besides, they've got &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; on here, don't they?  Maybe instead of glorifying Gwen and Tony's break up or singing about a near thirty year old woman's life they wanted to dance and have fun!  Why is that such a bad thing?  This album is very nice (though I wish the band was more visible; a lot of songs on the album are basically Gwen and a synthesized beat.  Makes ya wonder what the guys did while the CD was being recorded).  My fave tracks are Hella Good, In My Head, and Detective.  This album is way better than it's three and a half stars average rating makes it seem like.
B00004Z459|2.0|The cut being listenable music, which this CD has an abundance of. This is good music if you're 12, and rebellious. So is Slipknot and Papa Roach, but people grow up. Or do they. Or is it just that people are blinded by all the crap we see on our TV, that they can't appreciate good music. Probably both. But many 12+ year olds like this, screaming angst, which is disturbing and shows that people can be easily manipulated.<br />So, the band itself, the turntables give it that 'hip hop' feel, the noisy guitars try and make it metal, the drums are good, but the other two guys should leave, simply because thay make the band sink. The 'back up' singer doesn't really do much except occasionally do a poor rap or something, and the lead singer screams his head off until all the veins in his head burst. I like rock and metal and I don't mind some screaming, but what I don't like is somebody screaming 'shut up when I'm talking to you, shut up when I'm talking to you'. The only listenable song on the album is With You, good guitars and drums, a catchy chorus and best of all no angry screaming like a baby.<br />I gave it a generous 2 stars simply because the rest of the band are worth about 4, but the idiot with the mike moaning about his (wonderfully rich) life!
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|This movie has an excellent cast, an intriguing premise, and a chilling &quot;gothic&quot; visual appeal, but a small child could point out the plotholes, many of which could've been resolved quite easily.  The director seems to forget that even a ghost-story must obey its own internal logic.  The storytelling in this movie is sloppy, which is a shame.  If the story had held up, this could've been one of the best movies of the year.  After the initial premise is setup, the movie deteriorates into nonsense, until the ending where people are rushing around for no other reason than to wind up the movie.
B0000028RR|5.0|First off I want to start off by correcting DepressionClinic, who was correcting another member on saying that the Evil Empire referred to in the title of the album &quot;Evil Empire&quot; was the United States. He said that it wasn't, it was the nicknamed that leaders in the United States used to refer to the Soviet Union. While this is a true statement, it misses the irony in the cover. There is a star representing the United States/capitalism in the background of the cover along with a typical American looking boy, juxtaposing the Evil Empire, making the statement that the United States has become what it once opposed, or that it always was an Evil Empire. I'm not really sure. La Roca (sp?) is a Mexican and is obviously quite unhappy with the U.S government treatment of the Mexican people.<br />Back to the review: I really like the sound of the band, and this is one of the best rock albums of the 90's. For that it gets my 5 stars. Being a diehard conservative myself, I strongly disagree with the band's message, but I do respect the fact that they are expressing their views (isn't that what America is all about?).
B0001DI0FI|3.0|M&C is not the best film you will ever see, nor is it the best marine film you will ever see, or the best war film you will ever see, but it is nautical miles ahead of the other disastrous `pirate movies' (M&C is a mix of oldskool pirate films and war on the sea genres), except for the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" which has set a standard that M&C can not seem to match - except on the acting/dialogue front and possibly the cinematography, however the choreography for the action sequences is not good, appears disjointed, and many elements of the story are simply left to drift ashore while we sail through a boring patch of the four seasons.<br />M&C is a film of many elements (Darwin, science vs war, superstitions, commanders matching wits), but sadly remains somewhat disengaging throughout the whole affair and this is a problem of not fleshing out the characters enough... or trying to cope with too many characters. In fact we learn very little, if nothing, of our heroic sailors save for the various moments in Captain Jack's (Crowe) dining quarters where he makes some philosophical statements about sailing and that is that. Emotions are derived from watching children die in the heat of battle and although at times this is gruelling to watch, you will soon get board of this theme.<br />Film director Peter Weir does miss the mark as many critics have pointed out. While correctly opting for lots of battle sequences, he doesn't pull everything off so well and confusion reigns in several key action moments. So when the camera is not focused on cannon shells flying through masts it is drifting between umpteen characters and ship hands who all have a line, but little more than that. Even one of our favourite hobbits (Boyd) only shows up for a few scenes. Also Crowe's role is almost eclipsed by Paul Bettany playing Dr. Stephen Maturin the Surgeon who becomes a major pivotal character and a plot device, but this is because M&C looses control of who should be at the helm at times but never really tries to be anything more than just a battle between two boats on the sea (The Brits on the `Surprise' vs Napoleon's `Acheron'). For this reason many who go to see the acting will get a little of what they wanted. Those who want to see planks splinter and riggings hurtling through the air will get their fair share of that too. However together the gel doesn't really glue and something tells this reviewer that some more character development on the pivotal roles would have a gone a long way.... even to the far side of the world. While this movie has mammoth production values (everything looks sublime and the boats awesome) a finely tuned script would not have hurt this piece one little bit.<br />Weir has given us a good movie that is well worth watching but does not really register as something you will remember the next day. As far as the DVD release goes, you will certainly find a lot worse and for all intensive purposes this is a family film with some moderate historical violence. I guess if you are looking for a more gung-ho \\"Gladiator\\" type of film you will disappointed.

0385336810|5.0|Sophie Kinsella manages to do it again. She yet again had produced a book that I find myself unable to put down. Her cute quirky comments never fail to make you smile. The romantic swist at the end is the icing on the cake. I found myself wanting more once it was over.
1577311523|5.0|I grew up in a moderate Baptist church. But, it wasn't until I was 40 years old that I consciously and decidedly surrendered my life fully to God. I made an absolute commitment at that point to follow, as best I knew how, the living Spirit of the living God. This was the real beginning of my deeper spiritual search.<br /><br />I studied the Bible, reading and praying over it many, many times. I involved myself in numerous Christian organizations, seeking to serve the God I knew. Also, I worked in the effort to restore the lives of the homeless and addicted. My sincere desire has always been to serve God and bring God's Unconditional Love to all people and all creation.<br /><br />Eventually I attended divinity school and graduated with a master of divinity degree. I learned to research the Scriptures and other historical and relevant literature with an open minded and spirited critique. After divinity school I continued my search, deeply exploring other religious traditions as well as more current writings concerning the Spirit of God and how that Spirit works within each of us and in our world as a whole.<br /><br />The teachings of Jesus, because of my Christian background, have always deeply touched me... \\"may they be One as we are One,\\"... \\"the Kingdom of God is inside you\\"... you must die to yourself to find real life. Also, I found a deep resonance with these more spiritual teachings of Jesus within some aspects of Buddhism, Taoism, and Sufism.<br /><br />All this is proper background to my sense of truth contained in \\"The Power of Now.\\" I have read hundreds of books in my search for greater truth... none, I believe, have been written in a more direct, relevant, and accurate way. Eckhart has put together a deeply enlightened and accurate instruction manual for reaching the highest stages of faith and consciousness. I cannot recommend it more highly for those who are ready. The readiness required is that the personal shell of ego, and ethnocentricity (which would include one's attachment to one's own faith tradition), must be broken. This is the shell that has blinded me in the past... and serves to blind everyone still centered in his or her own separate identity.<br /><br />When your shell has been broken, or when you feel that you are ready for this kind of challenge... the challenge to transcend your own current stage of faith or level of awareness, please read this book.

B000002C2E|5.0|This album's loveliness has wounded me - I'm reelin from the blow... Yes I'm a dedicated Bob fan and this is a definitive piece that is not even remotely depressing to me.  Bob has always defied traditional songwriting and this is no exception.  'Highlands' is in fact a hilarious song/spoken word that is an example of the man's brilliant diversity.  No other artist could win a Grammy for such inanity.  This one ranks up there with the best of his works if not at the top.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This movie was so interesting. I watched it more than once. There are so many wonderful points to be learned in this film, but the most important of all is to be true to who you are. Pai, the main character, is convinced that she is to be the next leader, and sets out to become just that. It isn't an easy road, which I am glad to see, because it mirrors true life, which is never that easy. However, she stays true to herself, and overcomes a big obstacle to achieve her goal.<br />The setting, and the film itself, are beautiful.
B0001Z53CY|2.0|Dont get me wrong, i like eminem and i like D12. This album out of the 21 tracks maybe has 5 good ones. The albums best are &quot;how come&quot; and &quot;good die young&quot;. I was just very disapointed with the CD. With 21 tracks you know that there are gonna be many pointless skits and bad songs. I almost gave this album 3 stars, but it isnt worth that. What ever happened to the great songs like &quot;fight music&quot;, &quot;Revelation&quot;, &quot;Pistol Pistol&quot; and &quot;That's How...&quot; from Devils Night. I know this isnt the real D12 so hopefully they will come back strong.
0316921173|1.0|Ok - I am pretty hard to chase away from a book, espically one that got as much hype as Infinite Jest.  Is the praise for this book some kind of publisher-sponsored cabal?  <br />This thing wanders around worse than Blog.  Does the next wave of fiction not require editing?  Is there a voice in there?  I confess, I couldn't even pick it up anymore after 150 pages.  I came to this site just so I could rant somewhere.  <br />Comparisons to Pynchon are perhaps the greatest jest of all.  Pynchon's work has a voice and a world.  This book reads, at best, like the notes for a book.   The first draft maybe, or the spewings of someone with a serious case of hypergraphia.<br />And what's up with the middle name?  Why doesn't the author just go all the way and call himself D. Foster Wallace?  That's the pinnacle of pretense, which perhaps is the wellspring of this tedious tome.  <br />A bit harsh, to be sure, but with so many pages, I expected so much good reading.  This soup needs reduction.  There - now I can move on.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I saw this show on broadway in nyc about a month ago, and I have to say, the first half hour or so is really slow.  In fact, I almost walked out, but i'm glad that i diddnt because it gets really good once the background story in the beginning finishes.  I loved the book, and the concept is great, so I was a little disappointed that the musical wasnt a little more sophisticated. It seemed to me like it wouldnt have taken that much more of an effort to make some of the lyrics a bit more, well, relevant.   A couple of the songs (particularly the chorus) is a little cheesy, but after listening to the cd a few times, the soundtrack grows on you, and it will make you want to see the show again.   Overall it is a cool show, in fact, probably the best of the new broadway musicals.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is quite possibly the WORST film ever made. The only reason it was made is because Sofia's daddy could help her with the financing. Don't waste your time.
B0001EBXBK|5.0|A MASTERPIECE IF THERE EVER WAS ONE.<BR>This movie is brilliantly conceived and wonderfully excuted in everyway imaginable. The storyline is your classic revenge epic and is powerful and moving. <BR>Characters are well developed; you either love them or really hate them. You really feel \\"The Bride\\"'s (Uma) from the moment the movie begins and you really want her to kick some arse after seeing what happend to her, and Quintin doesn't let you down there. O-Ren is great, the cartoon showing her background was unexpected yet suitable for the movie and I really ejoyed it. Gogo is great, a take no crap psycho cutie that can really dish it out. I love her.<BR>This movie really is very beautiful once you get past all the blood and gore which is almost cartoonish.f the most beautiful movies I have ever scene. It is also hilarious at times too. The scene with Hatori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba) had me in stitches it was so funny. <BR>The fight scenes are some of the best stuff I've scene since Iron Monkey. Showdown at House of Blue Leaves is my favourite movie scene of all time. Bodies everywhere! Amazingly excuted by all involved. Just awesome. The final fight scene with O-Ren is so beautiful. Pure white snow falling on a moon-lit japanese garden with sounds of trickling water and the clashing of swords. O-Ren's pure white dress and Uma's blood-stained copy of the outfit Bruce Lee wore in his final fight scene are great too.<BR>I love the music in all parts of the movie. The speghetti western, samurai and other borrowed music was well selected and the original tracks are also awesome. I especially love the \\"5,6,7s and 8s\\", there's just something about Japanese girls singing surf music...<BR> BEST MOVIE EVER!!!

076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was an excellent book. It is very down to earth, very easy to relate to. By the end of my reading I felt like I almost knew Morrie personally. I honestly hate to read but with this particular novel I could not put it down.  <BR>Morrie Schwatz was a history professor at Brandeis University. Mitch Albom, a former student of Morrie's and a well known sports writer. Mitch was reunited with Morrie several years later after the doctors diagnosed Morrie with ALS. Mitch had heard about Morrie's diagnoses from an interview with Ted Koppel on Nightline. Once Mitch got wind of the news he decided to go and visit Morrie. Mitch's job had gone on strike so that allowed him the time to go and visit Morrie. The visit actually turned into a regular meeting every Tuesday.  <br />Morrie was a well spoken man he was so full of wisdom and knowledge. If I was a character in the book I believe that I could just sit all day and listen to Morrie talk. Morrie would always talk to Mitch about different subjects, some of their conversations were on the touchy side and others were not. Due to Morrie's diagnoses every Tuesday that Mitch would go to visit him, Mitch would noticed that Morrie's health was on a decline each time.  <br />Morrie always told Mitch what was on his mind. Morrie I guess you could say was real or well more real than other people out there in today's world. Morrie once went to a funeral and said, \\"what a waste all those people saying wonderful thing and the guy that died didn't even get to hear them.\\" Morrie said to Mitch as a word of knowledge, \\"forgive yourself, forgive others, don't wait.\\" Morrie said, \\"the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let it come in.\\"  <br />Morrie said that the one thing he hated most about his disease was knowing that one day he would not be able to go to the bathroom by himself. Toward the end of Morrie's life he actually saw that day. In the book it says that on the 14 Tuesday Morrie andMitch more or less say good bye to each other. Morrie passed away on the following Saturday and was buried the following Tuesday.  <br />Morrie's main thing was to teach Mitch the right ways of life. How not to be tied up in all the hustle and bustle of the world today. But to actually sit down and look at what's around. To look at the meaningful things in live and what they bring to you. Its crazy how our society works that it takes someone dying or a tragedy for people to realize what life really means.
B000148KK2|5.0|As my public nick name suggests, I usually stick to reviewing books. My taste in music is so eclectic as to border on the bizzare. So I accept that albums I love are not to everyones taste. But the reviews I glanced at for this CD are so far out of line I HAD to &quot;write in&quot; and disagree.<br />I suppose if you want to pigeon hole Krall as a very talented singer who only covers Jazz standards, then you cannot fail to dislike this CD. But if you insist an artist only do what they did on their earlier CDs, how can one call yourself a fan of the artist? You may be a fan of the singers style when doing Jazz standards, but not of the artist. But on to the important stuff, the new CD.<br />This is a real departure from Kralls' previous recordings. 7 of the 12 offerings are written or co-written by Krall and Costello. And the other 5 do not fall under the heading of Jazz standards.<br />You still have the spare instrumentation of the music. Kralls' voice is as seductive and beguiling as ever showing off her consumate vocal skills. What you do not get is an &quot;easy listen&quot;. These are not songs you know well. It requires you to actually listen to the words. Yes, listen to the words - although many seem to find this concept either to much effort or strangely offensive.<br />This album reflects the changes going on in Kralls' life over the past few years ( loss of her mother to cancer, new love). So there is a certain rawness in song and sound. A large part of that may be that these are not covers of songs she has had the chance to polish smooth in numerous live performances. This is new stuff. In an interview she has said that these songs are already changing through performance and she expects them to change even more during her current concert tour. I would love to hear what would result if she went into the studio after her tour and re-recorded this entire album. I will admit that I was torn between 4 or 5 stars, since as I say: there is a certain raw, unpolished feeling since she has not had the opportunity to polish these in concert as usual. But I went with 5 as an aknowledgement of the risk she took in not sticking to the tried and true.<br />So, if you are looking for the same old Krall, the critics are correct - look else where, look backwards. If you want to see what is going on with Krall and are willing to actually listen to the artist, give this a listen. It plays now as I write this and it will be playing as I drive into Vancouver to hear (you know, that thing that happens as you actually listen to an artist) how it has changed, evolved from the studio on her current concert tour.
0671646788|5.0|This book started it all.  Without a doubt one of the best book ever written.  I just love it.  This book is about realizing your potential as an individual, and it makes a wonderful companion to other books on the market.  One such book is, \\"How to find your dream job and make it a reality: solutions for a rewarding and meaningful career\\" by Jason McClure.  Of course, this book about realizing your career potential, which is very important. <br />In his book Jason takes the complexity out of the job/career search, and makes it easy and doable, which is why I highly recommend Jason's book.  If you buy any book as a complement to the \\"Magic of thinking big\\" I would recommend Jason's book.  Both books are classics, and both books offer proven solutions.
B000063JDE|5.0|I just thought that I would take the time to boast that us English folk who tend to never get anything right when it comes to packaging and what not, have recently had a special edition of Blue Velvet released, and hard as this is to believe, It's better than yours.

HOW COOL IS THAT!<BR>Anyway, just thought some of you might be interested to know that.<br />&quot;You're so F*****G suave&quot;
B00005JKLZ|5.0|This is a movie which everyone must see... I recently saw this (April 2004) and realized that this movie was released in 2002.   The special effects are stunning and Jeremy Irons brings about an intensity and brings life the uberMorlock character.  Guy is excellent and his traumatic look at the lost of his loved one is  well-expressed and his desire to bring his love back by travelling back in time and his failure to rescue her makes him look inconsolable... <BR>Tragedy, combined with comedy, visual effects make this movie a truly memorable one!
B00005JKES|5.0|This is arguably the greatest Television program in history. You don't have to take my word for it, I don't really agree with this, but if it is not the best, it is definetely one of the best.<BR>If you love a great story you'll love this and if you don't then you'll love it anyway.<BR>Twin Peaks is fantastic. The script and story was adapted from the short book &quot;The secret diary of Laura Palmer&quot; and it was done to the best it possibly could have been.<BR>David Lynch is not fully responsible for the birth of this great television series, however he is the person most talked about for being part of it.<BR>The episodes he directs all seem so real that you feel like you know the town of twin peaks and the people in it. He is a genius when it comes to directing, and it certainly shows in this.<BR>The series is perfectly orchestrated, you will never get bored, you will be biting your nails and sitting on the edge of your seat, It's funny where necassery and the cliffhangers will leave you desperate for more.<BR>Do yourself a favour and buy this. You won't regret it and you will also decrease the treacherously long gap that is constantly increasing over the production of season 2.<BR>So save your money, put any ideas about getting season 8 and 9 of The X Files on hold (forever), don't bother with the latest dragged out and hollow Buffy seasons and buy this. It's brilliant!<BR>The story follows the unravelling of the mystery of Laura Palmers death. Thier are many twists and turns along the way that surprisingly never lose thier tension and appeal when you watch them more than once.(Unlike 24)<br />P.S<BR>I reccomend getting your hands on the English version since it contains the pilot episode that the U.S version doesn't. It is overpriced (Just like everything else in my crappy country) but it is the best version you can get.<BR>If you do take my advice and buy either the English or U.S version DO NOT WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURES if you havn't seen all of the showbefore.<BR>Whoever designed the set left in features that give away major twists that happen much later in the show. Take my advice on this, you will be very angry at whoever designed this set if you watch them and haven't seen all of twin peaks before. (They aren't very good special features anyway)<BR>I hope this review has been useful, now scroll back to the top of the page, and click buy.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This is one heck of a movie.  If you liked XMen the movie, part 2 will just leave you waiting for part 3.  The plot is good, the special effects are great, and the cast goes together perfect.  5 Stars for a deserving movie.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton is a master of movies that blur genre lines.   Burton's Batman and Batman Returns were action-adventure-superhero movies with a twist of black humor provided by Nicholson's Joker and DeVito's Penguin, respectively.  Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow were horror-comedies, and Mars Attacks was kitsch-scifi-comedy.  I could go on, but will get to the point.  Big Fish contains elements of tragedy, comedy, adventure, fantasy, and drama, and mixes them up into a delightful and sensitive tall tale unlike any of Burton's other works.<br />The casting is immaculate: Ewan McGregor makes a great younger version of Albert Finney, and Allison Lohman is a dead ringer for a young Jessica Lange.  Other members of this stellar cast include Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Billy Crudup, Helena Bonham Carter, and Robert Guillaume.   <br />Although the story is a bit uneven at times, spending a few moments too long in the fantastical reconstructions of Finney's youth, the stories are so worthwhile and entertaining that the viewer is willing to overlook this shortcoming.  The movie also runs a bit long at just over two hours, but the final scenes tie the movie together neatly and give the viewer a sense of completeness and satisfaction with the outcome. <br />The primary theme of the film is the stories that we tell and how they affect other people's lives, a topic in which I have long had a casual interest.  A secondary, but nonetheless important theme is one of a son reconciling with, coming to grips with, and ultimately accepting his father for who he is, not who the son wants his father to be.  This theme alone makes the film worthwhile, and causes the viewer to reflect on his or her own parental relationship.<br />Viewed with a less critical eye, the movie is still very entertaining and the sort of wildly imaginative story to which only Burton could do justice.  Probably the best film I've seen since The Passion of the Christ.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has done it, again! Kill Bill, Volume 1 is a trademark masterpiece that has the morbid blend of excessive violence and wicked humor a la only Mr. Tarantino.<br />Well displayed are the acts of revenge executed by a woman whose mission it is to nurse her scorn against all enemies that have dared to stand in her way and ruin her future hopes. Graphic and bloody scenes, action-packed anime, and the preoccupation with daydreams full of vengeance are all elements that create the psychological interplay among the characters.<br />Never before have I known for there to be such a combination of vengeance, sadism, megalomania, and narcissism, all rolled up in one package. At the beginning, Uma Thurman's Black Mamba sets the stage for how the tone of the movie is going to be set. She makes it clear that though she is rational when it comes to dealing with her enemies, her rationality is not the kind that includes mercy, compassion, or forgiveness. And this overture gives the viewer only a taste of what is to come.<br />Without giving the details away, this movie is so violent that it is, without question, not for children to view.<br />Central to the developing storyline in Kill Bill, Volume I is world-renowned, Japanese martial artist and actor, Sonny Chiba, whom Quentin Tarantino has regarded as one of the main inspirations for his particular brand of motion picture outputs.<br />Kill Bill, Volume I, all in all, is a great movie. If there is any down side or sour note, it is that the movie was filmed roughly half a decade after the death of the leading Japanese actor, Toshirô Mifune, who, in America, is perhaps most famous for his role as Toranaga in the 1980 miniseries, Shogun.<br />Potentially, there might have otherwise been an opportunity for Tarantino to provide another actor the chance to earn the level of recognition that was highly deserved, just as he had done with John Travolta in Pulp Fiction. It is reported that though Mifune could speak English, his lines were always dubbed in the American films in which he appeared, a major disappointment that would plague him until his death in 1997.
B000148KK2|1.0|I really like Diana Krall's music and her intepretations of jazz classics.  This album is supposed to be based on her life experiences, at least that was what she said in her interview about the album.  It is the first album of hers that I regretted purchasing. It has one song that would be good as an instrumental but it is so unmemorable that I forgot the name.  My musical tastes are very eclectic but this collage of music has no snap, none the pizazz of her previous albums, and it is frankly, just plain boring.
1592400876|1.0|My headline says it all. Another author riding their 15 minutes. If you are serious about writing then pick up the NY Times Style Guide. It is a soild, time tested piece of work that many wirting professionals refer to again and again. It is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the industry. If you want a quick read with references that those here in America will have trouble relating to, then get this.
B00005JMSE|3.0|If they stuck to the graphic novel. The core storyline was there, true, but there was lots that were changed, unnecessarily.<br />Here is a spoiler so don't read on if you don't want to know: Broom dies earlier in the story and much more painfully. His death is what sets off Hellboy (wonderful Ron Pearlman at his best) to inverstigate the frogmen and their origin, and how they are involved in the whole Nazi plot. Also Liz Sherman (Sweet and sensual selma Blair) should have been kept the way she was in the story.<br />I guess my feeling is that other than minor design changes, the story that was in the comic book was pretty damn perfect for screen adaptation. It should have been no problem to pull off specially for Del torro.<br />When I went to see the movie, I was expecting a darker, more claustrophobic and much more intimate movie, like Aliens, and also more horror than action. The narrative could have been done like the comic book, being done by Hellboy at one point and by Abe Sapien at another part and so on.<br />Another thing that bothered me was this: among all those visual effects and great performances, some of the details that would make the story much clearer and less confusing were lost. Also sorely missing is the bloody history of Cavendish Hall (where the story in the comics takes place, in volume one of Hellboy, highly revcommended read).<br />So...my recommendation? See the movie first, then read the comicbook. I know it sounds backwards, but you'll enjoy yourself better this way, since the comics are way much better and will leave you wanting to read up all the Hellboy you can get your hands on.
B00005JLYW|5.0|Don't take them seriously.  They're Charlies's Angels for cryin' out loud.  Look at the casting and you'll understand.  We're meant to have a good chuckle while looking at all the beauties (beauties known for comic talent not they're olympic metals.)  I can't take my eyes off of this movie when ever I see it playing.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, and the music in it was well chosen and worked great with the action.  I never buy soundtracks, but I loved the song &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; in this movie, and bought the CD strictly for that.  Overall the CD is very good, and right now it's spending alot of time in my CD player -- but I rated it down to 4 stars primarily for one reason.  I felt that the dialogue sections on the CD not only were not neccesary, but detract from it.  Otherwise I would've given it 5 stars.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|This film has lots of memorable scenes and moments, visually and imaginatively---the problem is that they don't really mesh to form a cohesive whole.  Tim Burton's technical prowess is unquestionable, but his storytelling leaves something to be desired.<br />Ewan McGregor (how the Scotsman pulled off the Alabama accent is amazing) and the talented cast do a great job, it's just that the story kind of fizzles out towards the last 30 minutes.  All spectacle and no real center, no real soul.
B0000203YT|5.0|I did not know who playwright Tom Stoppard was until after viewing this movie.  Now I know.  This movie will define his work in future years for all students of film.  It is a very subtle satire of the life of one of the greatest writers who has ever lived.
B000089RVX|5.0|It seems everyone wants to talk about how Evanescence is lacking creativity or that they are so over-rated and what not...<br />well let me assure you, I did not buy this because it was popular, I did not buy this because they won awards and all that good stuff....I bought this simply because I enjoyed the tracks I heard, I thought they made beautiful music, and after hearing the whole cd, I still stand by that, every song on this cd is amazing, and I can easily say that if they had never became popular and I discovered this one on my own, I'd still like it just as much as I do now.  So for the people who say they're too over-rated, I'd like to see you try and attempt what they did,  they're obviously doing something right if they attracted as many fans as they did.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|It's not normal for me to go see a movie in theater twice. This was the exception.  I have recommended it to many of my friends who have also enjoyed the movie.  While sad at parts, it's a movie that you walk out of with a huge smile on your face.<br />Needless to say, I'm picking up the DVD.
B00006RINF|5.0|A friend recently introduced me to Lacuna Coil. He and I are both big fans of female singers, particularly those with powerful and melodic voices. <br />So, when he referred me to a band he'd &quot;discovered&quot; named Lacuna Coil and recommended I check them out, I didn't second-guess him. And I'm glad I didn't.<br />What can I say about this band and, in particular, Comalies? Well, it's powerful, it's melodic, it's heavy, it's layered.. it's overall amazing. I'm so glad to have it in my collection.<br />Their music has oft been compared to Evanescence and, while I wouldn't say that's a poor comparison in a general sense (as I like Evanescence as well), I would also say it isn't entirely accurate.<br />Lacuna Coil's sound seems much &quot;bigger&quot;. Much more full.. it could be described as a &quot;wall of sound&quot;. Alot of that, for sure has to do with production. But, I would imagine it's also due, in large part, to the fact that it's a 6-piece band. However, that wall of sound is also *quite* melodic, heavy and what I guess earns it a &quot;goth&quot; label, it has a bit of a &quot;darkness&quot; to it. Whatever it is... it works.<br />As many have noted, the band has two singers, the clear &quot;lead&quot; being the striking *and* amazingly gifted Cristina Scabbia. I mentioned earlier that I'm a fan of female singers and, man.. Cristina floored me the first time I heard her... and continues to. Her voice is powerful, crystal-clear, pitch-perfect, melodic, deeply emotive and smooth as silk. It's something you just have to hear. In my opinion, the clearest example is track #8 &quot;The Ghost Woman and The Hunter&quot;. Beautiful. Along with music that is layered, moving and quite powerful, the emotion released in just that one song gives me goose-bumps every time. Another example is the chorus for track #7 &quot;Tight Rope&quot; - her voice cuts right through you - in a good way. It's amazing.<br />I did mention that there are two singers. Sharing vocal duties with Cristina is Andrea Ferro. Where Cristina is the passion and emotion, Andrea is the the power and &quot;anger&quot;. No less emotive, he too is a talented vocalist. Together they make a great duo, providing Lacuna Coil's music with a very interesting dynamic.<br />Musically, the rest of the band are no slouches, either. Throughout the entire CD are solid songs, with some intricate, layered and very in-your-face, &quot;full&quot; sounding pieces. These guys   know their instruments.<br />All in all, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone as a &quot;genre&quot; album, because that could turn people away who may really enjoy it. While I'm not necessarily a fan of &quot;goth rock&quot;, I am definitely a fan of good, memorable and powerful music. And, that is exactly how I classify Lacuna Coil.<br />I highly reccomend this album.
B0000542D1|5.0|I have only one question to ask the &quot;Pop Fan from the U.S. of A beeyatch!&quot; who left the review titled &quot;not for pop fans&quot; on August 5, 2002:  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
B00005ATQH|4.0|Do yourself a favor-and see this version of Lolita before you, or if you ever do get around to watching the 1997 film.This movie captures the novel's essence a whole lot more; not to mention, it's superbly acted and written, and feautures an array of great scenes.<br />James Mason is wonderful as Humbert Humbert. Stiff and charming and doomed all at the same time, he conveys his characters' feelings perfectly.Shelly Winters is an absolute riot and adds all the spunk and humor to the first part of the film.Peter Sellers works in some great lines as the pathetic Quilty, and Sue Lyons; well, she's not much of an actress, and she's a tad too old for the part.But the age gap is hardly noticeable, and one doesn't need to be much of an actress in order to convey the part of Lolita-she's more like a backdrop to the movie than an actual character. Yes, things get a bit drab in the end-the movie is certainly a whole lot more fun and irresistable in the beginning,due partly to the presence of Shelly Winters. And this film lacks the emotional impact, although I'm pretty sure it was intended as more of a dark comedy than a drama.<br />I don't think this movie is worthy of classic status or anything, but it's quite a great film.It's got great performances, and the script is absolute perfection,a marvel, I can't tell you how good it is(written by Nabokov himself).It's definately worth a watch, whatever your tastes.Don't expect to be blown away, but do expect to be fairly pleased, as all in all, this is a fine film.And if you're really,really curious, well then read the novel, which is more dense and difficult than one would imagine.
B0000507R2|5.0|First off, let me say Natalie Merchant is one of the best song writers out there. Her lyrics are so personal and emotional that one can feel the emotion in each of her songs.  Her voice is made for emotion. When  she sings River you can feel the pain she felt losing a friend and the anger at a world that looks for the &quot;dirt&quot; in what is simply a tragedy for those who loved him.<BR>I have both the CD version and the DVD-Audio version and the DVD-A is remarkable. The crispness of the instruments as well as Natalies' voice is truly beautiful.<BR>The DVD-A is well mixed with a natural presence.<BR>I reccomend this title in DVD-A because it is such a beautiful CD. To hear it in 96/24 is a real prize. The representation of all the instruments is impeccable. You will not be sorry.
B0000028P8|4.0|With this, Mariah's third album, Mariah proved that she was just as dynamic as a live performer. 'Emotions' begins, which sees Mariah hitting those incredible high notes. Followed by 'If It's Over', a very emotional and well sung song, the album continues the pace with 'Someday'. Mariah's version of 'Vision Of Love' is the only disappoint, as the tempo has been slowed, but is still a very nice presentation. 'Make It Happen' is excellently sung here, and is a great tune, with very inspirational lyrics. 'I'll Be There' is an amazing and extremely touching song, this song completely blew the critics away and gave Mariah her sixth number one single. Ending with 'Can't Let Go', a brilliant way to end, and very well sung. This set is very good, and a very relaxing album. As it is short, it leaves you wanting more, which is always a good sign. Mariah show-cases her incredible talent here, and is a great album for all music fans. Another triumph.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Nora Jones will go down in music history as one of the greats.  Listening to her music will give you that same wonderful almost haunting feeling that you get when you listen to the true greats like Janis Joplin or even Nick Drake. Its unfortunate that we only have dead singers to compare her to. Some reviewers have said she is \\"no Eva Cassidy\\", but she isn't Eva Cassidy, Janis or any great before her  , she is simply Nora Jones with her own sound and she deserves to be respected for that.  I would love to be able to look forward to a new Janis CD, or a concert but I can't, but I do have Nora, she is something to look forward to......lets hope she makes it past 27.   Buy her CD, you won't be disappointed
B0000028VT|5.0|Imagine it is 1993. You are eagerly awaiting the release of Mariah Carey's new disc, and love 'Dreamlover'. All is nice and sweet, the music and vocal talent apparant and excellent. Fast-forward to 2004, and 'Music Box' is still one of the best albums ever made, having sold over 25 million copies world-wide. 'Dreamlover' is the starter here, a brilliant and catchy pop song. The lyrics and vocals here are impressive. 'Hero' is one of Mariah's trade-mark ballads, along with 'Butterfly', 'Can't Take That Away' and 'Through The Rain'. 'Anytime You Need A Friend' has a gorgeous gospel feel to it, and has a very meaningful message. 'MusicBox' is a beautiful and subtle ballad, a soothing and romantic 4 mins. of pure bliss. 'Now That I Know' returns to party form; Mariah is one of only a few artists who go between ballads and up tempo numbers so effortlessly. 'Without You' is a massive favourite with fans. My favourite track, though, is 'All I've Ever Wanted'. This is an epic ballad, and once again shows us the talent and strength of Mariah's voice, when she chooses to unleash it. The ballads don't over-dominate the album because the up beat numbers are so effective. Although I feel that 'Daydream' and 'Butterfly' were better, this album is still a pure delight. Congratulations Mariah.
0385006896|5.0|The greatest detective in all of literature is between the covers of this excellent edition of the complete stories of Sherlock Holmes.  Of all the editions out currently out there, the Doubleday hardcover version is by far the best.  With 1122 pages, it's a hefty tome, but packed between the covers, in an edition that won't give you eye-strain to read, are all four full-length novels and fifty-six short stories, plus an excellent introduction by Christopher Morley.  This is the version to get.<br />There has never been anything quite like Sherlock Holmes; he's in a class by himself.  We meet him first in his late twenties, just starting a career as the world's only consulting detective, when he's introduced to his invaluable chronicler Dr. Watson.  What is Holmes without Watson?  He's not nearly as interesting alone; Watson is an absolute necessity.  Holmes needs Watson's obtuseness as a foil for his own razor-sharp brilliance.  In some of the later volumes, Holmes narrates a couple of his own cases.  They fall flatter than a pancake.  Let Holmes stick to what he knows; we must have Watson to show him to best effect.<br />There are so many great stories included in this volume that probably no two people's list of personal favorites will match; my own are &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; and &quot;The Copper Beeches&quot; from &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;; &quot;The Yellow Face&quot;, &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem&quot; from &quot;Memoirs&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; and &quot;The Second Stain&quot; from &quot;The Return&quot;, and &quot;His Last Bow&quot; from the volume of the same title.  The incomparable &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; rates as my favorite long novel.  Conan Doyle not only gave us some wonderful tales, but some unforgettable secondary characters as well: the pea-brained detectives Gregson and Lestrade; brother Mycroft, even more brilliant as Sherlock and even more eccentric; and the scruffy gang of street kids known as the Baker Street Irregulars.<br />Holmes himself is one of the most fascinating and enigmatic characters in all fiction.  Why doesn't he have (or seem to want)a life outside of solving crimes?  We know he has an off-and-on cocaine problem, not to mention some peculiar habits, such as shooting holes in his parlor walls to spell out VR (Victoria Regina) in bullet pocks (why his landlady didn't throw him out is never explained), and except for the inscrutable Irene Adler, he seems to have a marked aversion towards women.  Well, maybe it's just as well that his whole life was detecting and solving crimes, else how could he have been involved in so many delightful adventures?<br />As Morley says in his introduction to this volume, we should be grateful to those ophthalmic patients who kept missing their appointments with Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle, leaving him with enough spare time on his hands to write these stories.  In the lanky figure of his consulting detective, Conan Doyle created one of the most popular characters of all modern fiction.  There is no more compelling crime-buster, and never has been, and probably never will be, than Sherlock Holmes.more eccentric; and the scruffy gang of street kids known as the Baker Street Irregulars.  <br />Holmes himself is one of the most fascinating and enigmatic characters in all fiction.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|This album is good. It's just not great. The songs I love I REALLY love, but the songs I don't like I REALLY hate. The best track here is 'Toxic', but other high-lights include 'Me Against The Music', 'Breathe On Me', 'Outrageous', 'Shadow' and 'Everytime'. These are really fine songs, with some good ideas. But some songs are catastrophes, '(I Got That) Boom Boom' and 'Brave New Girl' being two. If you like the singles, get this album. It is good, not terrible, but could have been much better. This album is certainly Britney's best offering to date, and is more mature and interestin than Britney's past efforts.

0140386335|5.0|\\"The Neverending Story\\" is probably best known to the general public through Wolfgang Peterson's movie, whereas the original novel by Michael Ende is less well known. Despite the horrid sequels and the even worse television series that Michael Ende desperately tried to prevent in the last years of his life, Wolfgang Peterson's first attempt at bringing the book to the big screen was successful and popular. However, fans of the book will know that it only records the first part of the story - though Peterson compensates by telling us in the final segment of the film \\"Bastian had many more adventures before finally returning to the ordinary world. But that's another story...\\"<br />Since it's likely that you've seen the movie but not read the book, I highly recommend that you track down the original story - the movie stands on its own, but the book takes Bastian on a deeper and more dangerous journey into Fantastica and the inner regions of the soul, both adding detail into the movie's progression, and continuing into a larger and more fascinating adventure. Usually I always suggest reading books before watching any movies that they are based on, but in the case of \\"The Neverending Story\\" I make an exception - it is much better to scratch the surface of Ende's imagination in Peterson's very good interpretation of the book's first half, and then immerse yourself in the deeper book-within-a-book that Ende wrote, filled with adventure, intrigue, possibilities, mystery, thought-provoking ideas, beloved characters and probing into the depths of the human psyche.<br />Bastian Balthazar Bux is a rather tubby, unpopular victim of bullying at the school, with a deceased mother and a grieving father. His one consolation in life is books, his absolute passion. This love of stories and the magic they bring is the reason why he runs off with \\"The Neverending Story\\", the large volume he finds in Mr Coreander's old book store. Hiding himself in the attic of his school, he is soon intoxicated by the story that unfolds: a young warrior named Atreyu is chosen to seek out a cure for the deathly ill Child-like Empress, the ruler of the realm of Fantastica. In a quest filled with danger, and joined by the joyful luck-dragon Falkor, Atreyu must also avoid the growing threat of the mysterious \\"Nothing\\" - a force that is slowly eating up his world. What the Nothing truly is, what the elusive cure for the Empress is, as well as the nature of Fantastica and Bastian's role to play in its fate are mysteries gradually unfolded as he finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into the story. As it progresses, he finds himself wondering - could this particular story be *real*?<br />\\"The Neverending Story\\" is a work of true children's literature, and anyone who loves books for their own sakes and appreciates the importance of imagination is sure to find this a favourite. It is filled to the brim with memorable characters - Falkor, Atreyu, Engywook, Grograman, Yikka, and my personal favourite, the sinister, elusive Gmork, and touches on some of the most primitive questions of the human mind: life and death, hope and despair, existence and oblivion, the corruption of power, the basic needs of humanity...I could go on. In terms of sheer imagination and stark visual beauty, Ende rides to the top of the list along with Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Phillip Pullman and other authors of this calibre.<br />If there is one issue that brings fault, it is that the original manuscript was written in German - therefore the rhyming verses that are prevalant in the text feel rather disjointed, with the translator struggling to convey the content of the German version (which would have been more fluid and rhythmic) whilst forcing rhyme into the English.<br />But this is irrelevant in the bigger picture, for this is a must read, just as Peterson's film is a must-watch. It is nothing less than a tragedy that money-hungry producers were allowed to exploit Ende's book into the appallingly badsequels and series, and I do my best to pretend that they don't exist. But here, fans of Peterson's movie, or those that have never heard of \\"The Neverending Story\\" before, will be well rewarded if they read Ende's book - the width and length that your imagination will expand after reading makes it well worth the effort.sequels and series, and I do my best to pretend that they don't exist.

B00006RU5B|5.0|I bought this after listening to &quot;show me how to live&quot; and &quot;Like a stone&quot;. When I first listened to Cochise, I knew it was going to be a good CD.

B00004XOWM|1.0|I had the misfortune of being stuck in a car while the driver played this steaming pile.  In all seriousness, knowing that he owned it forever diminished my respect for the guy.<br />This album probably has the corniest lyrics I've ever heard.  It seems like Durst bought a Fisher-Price &quot;My First Rock Song&quot; kit and used it to compose each track.  In fact, some of the tunes are so childish they sound like a louder version of Adam Sandler. <br />I know what you're thinking: Which song is the worst?  That's a tough question.  &quot;My Way&quot; is certainly a worthy contender for worst song, that is until you hear &quot;Rollin'&quot; without the benefit of being deaf.  One could also make a strong case for &quot;My Generation,&quot; until he's subjected to &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; (it's even worse than it sounds).  <br />It doesn't matter which song is the worst, really.  By record's end, you won't be able to tell them apart anyway.  They all just become white noise after a while.  And no matter how happy you are in life, this album will leave you contemplating suicide.  Maybe that's why Durst has a Cobain tattoo.<br />Now I know why it's called CHOCOLATE STARFISH AND THE HOT DOG FLAVORED WATER...because it feels like sodomy.
0099443244|5.0|This 10-year study with volunteers reveals that good fortune is not due to talent, hard work or intelligence. This scientific investigation is based upon interviews and experiments with people who consider themselves lucky; the author concludes that luck is a state of mind.<br />Wiseman identifies four principles that underlie a life of good fortune, adherence to which will draw good luck into the life of the individual. These are 1. The belief that you are lucky. Lucky people create, notice and act upon chance opportunities. They also have a relaxed attitude to life. 2. Lucky people make success happen by using their intuition and gut feelings. 3. One must expect good fortune, hold fast to this belief and persevere in attempting to achieve your goals. 4. Lucky people have a knack for transforming back luck into good luck. One must affirm your good fortune and have a strong conviction that everything will work out for the best.<br />The text is illustrated by graphs from the research plus some black and white illustrations of playing cards. Overall the conclusions are quite impressive and I find the results of the study very convincing. There are plenty of exercises and the book concludes with notes that include bibliographic references. It is heartening to finally see scientific proof of the claims made by sages and esotericists down the ages.
0441009425|5.0|I take issue with those who say that Reynolds can't write or is unimaginative. It's amazing writing, and one of the most creative books I've read in some time. The style is highly literate (even if your vocab is large you may learn a word or two). And every page contains at least one technology, circumstance, or invention so fascinating and unexpected that you'll have to stop and read the section over again.<br />Yes, Reynolds does use semicolons when he should be using commas, dashes, or periods. It's a stylistic choice, though. Anyone who can string a sentence together as well as this guy certainly knows punctuation protocol. Think of his semicolon usage as a far-future convention. A forthcoming change in 'the rules.' It's a pretty flexible little mark anyway, and people love to take license with it.<br />His writing is definitely on par with that of Dan Simmons--it's just colder. The story demands it. Revelation Space is a lonely, dark, and chilling book. The characters are fully developed and complicated people, but the tone of the book is such that most of them have some kind of a defensive wall around themselves. Not so different from modern society, a lot of the time. Here, it's taken to the extreme, as the plot revolves around deception and hidden agendas. <br />This book is tight. And very, very complex. I put Reynolds up there with Simmons and Robert Charles Wilson--writers whose authorial abilities are as interesting as the stories themselves.
B0000073I5|3.0|After finishing &quot;Duke&quot; with Genesis at ABBA's now-defunct Polar Studios in Sweden, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks stayed to record their solo debuts.  They had other vocalists sing lead, in this case Noel MacCalla.  The album has some of the sounds you hear in Genesis in this time period, but it's not quite the same.  Half the LP is a concept based on a book about a middle-aged factory worker's adventures.  Paul Carrack, then in Squeeze and later Mike &amp; the Mechanics, was originally considered to do the vocals, but had other engagements.  This is for hardcore fans only.  The LP was released in the U.S. by Passport/Jem Records.  I once saw the UK CD, but I didn't bother to get it.
B000003TAL|4.0|Much of Sonic Youth's career has been a resounding confirmation of the fact that noisy, discordant music can be extremely fun to listen to, and &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; is among the most convincing testaments to their talents.  More than anything else, Sonic Youth are notable for their ability to blend unpredictable, unconventional songwriting with a keen pop sensibility and their uniquely stream-of-consciousness lyricism.  &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; is certainly classifiable as a rock album, but it also shows the roots of the modern post-rock movement that has produced such acts as Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor.  Yes, the songs here are typically pretty long, with a few hovering around the seven-minute mark, but the Youth generally manage to pack in enough twists and turns to avoid monotony, and it doesn't hurt that there are some mighty catchy hooks here to chew on.  Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo have become a legendary guitar duo for a reason, and &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; sees them unleashing an array of their typically intricate and memorable sounds.  Their guitars intertwine, clash, and drop in and out of each other in endlessly fascinating ways, slicing and dicing genre cliches at every turn.  Conventional rock riffage is in short supply here, replaced by a blurry fuzz of microtonal screeches and skronks that somehow manages to perfectly balance beauty and aggression.  On tunes like the powerhouse opener &quot;Teenage Riot,&quot; &quot;Eric's Trip,&quot; &quot;Hey Joni,&quot; and &quot;Candle,&quot; the guitars wrap themselves tightly around Thurston's effortless vocals, while Kim Gordon's rumbling bass and the dexterous drumming of the shamefully underrated Steve Shelley provide a rock-solid rhythmic background.  The warp-speed &quot;Silver Rocket&quot; provides the album's best illustration of Sonic Youth's punk influences, with Thurston barking out the lyrics over a furious backbeat.  &quot;'Cross The Breeze&quot; is a flat-out masterpiece, with a raging intro giving way to Kim's forceful vocals and freaky imagery before Thurston and Lee embark on an extended guitar freakout that's blinding in its brilliance.  &quot;Rain King&quot; is dark and edgy, filled with ominous vocals and swirling guitars that bite down hard.  The concluding &quot;Trilogy,&quot; true to its title, is an awe-inspiring epic in three parts that perfectly encapsulates everything this band can do, from its hard-rocking opening to its textured instrumental passages to its trippy conclusion.  Now, Sonic Youth have gained a reputation in some circles as being pretentious, and they do occasionally provide some support for such claims (witness &quot;The Sprawl&quot; and &quot;Providence&quot;).  However, since they set their ambition so high, it's easy to tolerate some occasional overreaching.  I wouldn't say &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; is quite as good the band's masterpiece, the magnum opus &quot;Dirty,&quot; but it's certainly worth checking out.  If it's sonic adventurism you're looking for, you could do a whole lot worse.with a raging intro giving way to Kim's forceful vocals and freaky imagery before Thurston and Lee embark on an extended guitar freakout that's blinding in its brilliance.  &quot;Rain King&quot; is dark and edgy, filled with ominous vocals and swirling guitars that bite down hard.

But if great dialogue and raw emotion hold your interest, it doesn't get any better than this.  Every one of these guys should have won an award for their roles in this movie.  Not sure if this particular DVD contains the interview with Jack Lemmon that was included after one of the cable TV broadcasts of the film.  If not, it should!
0425098532|5.0|This 1939 novel has been compared to the 1930 STRONG POISON by Dorothy Sayers.  Both novels begin with the courtroom observations of a young woman accused of murder by poisoning.  Both young women are befriended by a young man who sets out to clear her of the crime and fall in love with her in the process.  Christie's rescuer is named Peter Lord while Sayers' is, of course, Lord Peter.  Even with these similarities the two stories, although both excellent, are vastly different.<br />Elinor Carlisle had an understanding with her cousin-by-marriage Roderick Welman, that one day they would wed, live happily in their mutual Aunt Laura's country house with her considerable fortune somehow split between them.  The plan suited them all, Elinor, Roddy and Aunt Laura. Aunt Laura was now in failing health and was being cared for by nurses, her servants, a doctor and Mary, a young woman who had grown up on the estate and of whom Aunt Laura had always been quite fond...perhaps too fond for Elinor and Roddy's own good.<br />Aunt Laura died, not to anyone's surprise but had left no will, much to everyone's surprise.  As her only living blood relative Elinor inherited everything - lucky Elinor!  Except Mary was so lovely, and Roddy so smitten with her that the engagement was called off.  Then Mary died, of poison and Elinor was the only one of could have committed the crime.<br />Dr. Lord made an impassioned plea to Hercule Poirot to prove Elinor innocent - if she was in fact innocent.  Poirot reluctantly agrees and begins to sort through motives, love affairs and long buried secrets to arrive at the truth.<br />The opening is dramatic altough it causes the problem of making the most sympathetic character, Mary, known to the read as the victim.  The questions remain, however, of who did it, why, and how for the reader to try to puzzle through before Poirot reveals all.
B00008NG5V|5.0|From song 1 to song 16 jack johnson did an awsome job. If you are looking for a cd to just relax too this is the one for you. He has done two videos of On and On. Taylor was an awsome video he had ben stiller in it. If you get a chance check it out. The Horizon has Been Defeated was the other one. Also good. Just listening to the cd gives you good vibes. You listen to one song and its very hard to not listen to the rest. Pick it up if you don't have it.
B00013PHGS|5.0|The first Time I heard of Air was on a review on Rollingstone earlier this year, without any information or back up of this French duo I decided to get a copy via Amazon at &quot;My own Risk&quot;,<br />I like David Bowie's &quot;Low&quot; so the Influence in  this Album RS mentioned on their review was good enough for me to adventure,<br /> The first Track &quot;Venus&quot; did not impress me much but I soon as I listened to the first haunting notes on &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot;<br />I knew I had acquired a winner, and further listening to  the other tracks  they did not disappoint at all! , &quot;Run&quot; with the robotic Voice and atmospheric keyboards made an even better impression, &quot;Universal Traveller&quot; became a superb  piece after a couple of listens  and after the Excellent (and My Favorite Track) &quot;Mike Mills&quot; were enough to convince myself that I was up to an excellent talented band on the downtempo genre as to get the rest on thir catalogue, later I got all at once (&quot;Moon Safari&quot;,&quot;Premiere Symptoms&quot;,&quot;Virgin Suicides&quot; And &quot;10000 Hertz Legends&quot;) I found Gems and excellent pieces of music in all of them but not as consistenly as I did On &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot;  maybe because it was my first introduction to this French Duo or because is the one that mostly appeals to my taste or simply because it is just excellent!, Well back to TW there are also other very good Electro/Downtempo/Pop tracks like &quot;Surfing on a rocket&quot; ( A favorite at first listen) &quot;Alpha Beta Gaga&quot; and &quot;Biological&quot; , in all it is a good listen from Begining to end.Give this album a couple of good listens and you will be hooked, I hope that they maintain this quality and looking forward to their future works.Highly Recommended.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|The whole soundtrack is of course a must-own for any music lover. John Debney made a truly remarkable job in bringing the music from all over the world and fuse it into one in this CD. Of particular interest, is the \\"Song of Complaint\\", which has music from distant Azerbaijan, played by Goksel Baktagir and Yurdal Tokcan, and internally known as the \\"Azeri\\" song. (...). The instrument used, duduk, is an ancient one used in the Caucasus, particularly in Western Azerbaijan. Here's how the \\"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\\" defined it in its last, 3rd edition (1973, in English): \\"DUDUK (from the Turkish du:du:k), a wind instrument having a pipe about 300 mm in length with nine fingerholes and a double reed. Usually twoduduks are played--one performer plays the melody while the other holds a single tone (the pedal point). The dudk is widespread amon the people of the Caucasus. (vol. 8, p. 438)\\".<BR>One of the best duduk players from Azerbaijan, Alihan Samedov, can be heard here: (...).<BR>The relevance of such music in the OMS for the film is that Azerbaijan, known as Caucasian Albania in ancient times, was one of the first - and some say the first - nations in the world to make Christianity as their official religion, back in 4th century A.D. The oldest church in the whole region is also located in the north-east of Azerbaijan, in the village of Kish. This is the ancient land visited by the apostle's and contemporaries of Christ. (...)
B000089RVX|5.0|Anyone with suicidal issues and depression need to buy this album. This album is only for the deep-minded. Hollow-heads won't understand a thing of it. Don't think that all the songs sound like \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" because they don't. Each one is unique and very spiritual. And when I heard \\"Tourniquet\\" I was really blown away, cause this song was so simple and and yet so deep. God used this album to touch my heart. I don't think I'll ever get tired of this album, because I don't listen to it for the entertainment. <BR>And check this: \\"Bring Me To Life\\" has been turned in to a worship song. This band is awesome! They deserve every good review they get. It's good that somebody's singing about real issues and not about sex and swearing. If you talk crap about this album you need to get over the fact that Evanescence is more popular than you, and that they're making more money than you ever will.

B00004Z459|5.0|This is defiently the best of all the linkin park albums. This is one of the few CDs that i can listen to from the first track to the last! Their debut is an awsome album to listen too for many reasons. One is the sound that is unique to linkin park alone. The mix between rap/singing/turntables is one that linkpark has perfected. Each song on this album has awsome lyrics that you can relate to. The songs are not too hard metal, but they are very instrumental. In my opinion, the best songs on this album are; with you, forgotten, and pushing me away. I would recomend this album to anyone who is looking for a good CD to buy that they will listen to often.
B0000AEKAW|5.0|This CD will blow you away. This woman has amazing talent and a wonderful and peaceful voice. Her songs are so peaceful and melodic, and the lyrics are incredible. Here is my overall outlook of the CD.<br />Since I got the regular version, however, Work It Out (one of my fave Beyonce songs) and '03 Bonnie & Clyde aren't on my list.<br />1.Crazy In Love- 6/10  This song is great. I used to like it a lot when it was made, but since I got the CD a few weeks ago, I kind of dislike it now. But I LOVE the hook.<br />2.Naughty Girl- 4/10  I don't really like this song that much. It just didn't grab my attention. <br />3.Baby Boy- 8/10  I LOVE this song. This song has to be one of the best songs on the album. It has that middle-eastern vibe, which I love, and Sean Paul is on it. Even though I can't understand a word he's saying, I love the beat, and Beyonce just makes it even better.<br />4.Hip Hop Star- 8/10  Another GREAT song. Great beat, but Beyonce didn't put a lot into it vocally. It's still great, though. Big Boi and Sleepy Brown are on this one, and I LOVE Outkast, so it makes it even better.<br />5.Be With You- 7/10  This song is good. The beat isn't much, but her lyrics are. She copied part of this song from an old school song that I don't know the name of. I love the way she sings, and her lyrics are fantastic.<br />6.Me, Myself, And I- 3/10  I didn't like this song AT ALL. To me, it was WAY overplayed, and a song like Hip Hop Star could have been put in its place. It was annoying listening to this song over and over again on the radio, but hey, there will be better songs.<br />7.Yes- 9/10  This song was just great. She sings about her ex-boyfriend, who is obviously rushing into sex, as the songs goes. This song relates to me, because I'm not a fan of rushing into physical things AT ALL. Plus, I like the beat of it.<br />8.Signs- 8/10  This song is also good. I like the beat, and the way she rhymes everything. (Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries) Missy Elliot, one of my FAVE female rappers is also on this song. However, I did hear a little reversing of the lyrics (Missy's touch, probably.) which made her sound like she was saying something in Chinese. But, the song was excellent.<br />9.Speechless- 8/10  This is a straight-up LOVE-MAKING song. This song is great! I love the lyrics, especially, and from the beat of the song, I knew it suggested something sexual. The first time I listened to it, I was thinking, WOW! At first I thought it was nasty (only sweat between us.....) , but now I think it's just good.<br />10.That's How You Like It- 6/10  This song is okay. It was nothing special, but I liked the beat of it. Jay-Z, her boyfriend (or should I say husband?) lended some words on the song. It was an okay song.<br />11.The Closer I Get To You- 2/10  I didn't like this song not ONE BIT. It was kind of boring, and I always skip this song. It's the only song on the album that I will completely skip.<br />12.Dangerously In Love- 6/10  This song is pretty good. Once again, her lyrical flow proves successful. She sings about her ex-boyfriend (because in the song, she sings, \\"you loved me before I became who I am.\\"). It was good, but it tooker like 20 MINUTES to sing the end of the song. When she performed it on the Grammys (which she won 5 AWARDS! Go girl!), I was laughing because everyone was clapping even though she wasn't done. I don't know if she was stalling for that dove to come, or if it was part of the song, but it was a good performance. I'm getting away from the point. Good song, but not that special to me.<br />13.Beyonce Interlude-  7/10  Although she was just talking, she said something that I really liked: Your love goes beyond what I can say. That was so beautiful. She really loves the guy she's singing about.<br />14.Gift From Virgo- 10/10  This song is SO GOOD! It made me CRY once. She loves this guy sooo much! The part that made me tear up was when she goes, \\"when it's time to leave, it's so hard to say goodbye..\\". It was TOO beautiful. I wish this was the end of the CD though, because the next song made me cry even harder.<br />15.Daddy- 10/10  I give this song a full score, because it had great lyrics, and made me cry. HARD. She sings about her father, and I was just thinking about my dad when she sang it. I got teary when I heard it. Such a beautiful song. However, I can't listen to it anymore because I don't wanna cry from it!<br />Overall Score:110  Possible Score:150<br />This CD was just great. I bought it beause I love Beyonce, and because I just KNOW who she is talking about in every song. (Jay-Z) I love hearing her voice, and I know I didn't waste my money on this album.
B00018D44U|1.0|I don't even own this CD.  I've just heard it like 500 times because a lot of my less musically-inclined friends enjoy it.  Other reivews of this CD are right, this is boring, uninteresting, and extremely unchallenging music.  This &quot;music&quot; is so boring it would put coffee to sleep.  It's just that regular morons dislike to be challenged when listening to music and prefer to never get any smarter.  This crap is just plain watered down.  Why listen to Norah Jones's version of Duke Ellington's Melancholia (intelligently renamed &quot;Don't Miss You at All&quot;) when you can listen to the original, which is 10 times better and 10 times more musically advanced.  It's like the difference between reading a picture book about Hamlet or the real play.
B000148KK2|1.0|After Live in Paris I was so excited to get this album. What a waste of my money. Unfortunatley you can't get refunds on opened music. Elvis Costello..well..lets just say..if this is supposed to be great music, I'll never buy music again! What a dissapointment. I'll file this one under G for garbage. What blows me away is the critics will hail this as a great piece, and I will use it for a coaster.
0780622553|4.0|First off, it is gratifying to see such a high, collective  rating for this film.  For the longest time I thought I was with a select few who appreciated this gothic Sci-fi tale from director Alex Proyas.  Alex Proyas also directed &quot;The Crow&quot; which has a similar ambience.  But &quot;Dark City&quot; is a different animal, altogether.  Take the gothic texture from &quot;The Crow,&quot; add an eerie touch of &quot;Hellraiser,&quot; just a dash of &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; and a vague understanding of this film begins to emerge.  The title character played by Rufus Sewell is searching for his past, constantly pursued by &quot;The Strangers,&quot; and slowly the mystery unfolds.  I've heard some say that they knew what was happening long before the end, but when I saw this in the theater I had no idea what to expect so I let the story play itself out.  Eventually I was rewarded for my patience with a superb plot revelation.  As for the acting, Rufus Sewell is excellent, almost single-handedly carrying the film.  All of &quot;The Strangers&quot; are memorable, particularly the lead characters who bring a seriously evil feeling to these nightmarish beings.  Jennifer Connelly is passable, seeing that she really has nothing to work with here; that, and she can't lip-sync to save her life.  William Hurt is good here, adding a slightly cynical perspective and depth to the grand mystery.  But the eye-sore of the film is Kiefer Sutherland.  He overacts in every scene, apparently gasping for air...between...every...word(or phrase)...he...says.  It gets annoying fast.  As for the visual effects, some are outstanding while others need a little more work.  The look of the movie, from the costumes to the dark city-scape, are all well-thought out and memorable.  &quot;The Strangers&quot; are some of the creepiest creations in recent memory: pale incarnations walking slowly after their prey while wearing long, black trenchcoats and black hats.  More than once they hover and fly through the air, other times wielding switch-blade knives.  All in all, this is a worthy edition to the Sci-fi genre, very nearly (at least in my mind) achieving Cult Film status.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Gripe, gripe, gripe...which is something we could do all day long. I realize that many people (including myself) are passionate about these films, but hey, that's it fellas THEY ARE ONLY MOVIES, great movies nonetheless, but still just movies. I've had it about up to here with \\"Han shooting first\\", or \\"TPM sucked\\", or \\"Jar-Jar this & that\\". Guess what? Lucas created them, Lucas made them, and he can damn well do whatever he pleases with HIS movies. And if we don't like it, we can STOP buying his, tapes, toys, DVD's, collectables, OR make our own movies. Let's put it this way, the expanded universe: comics, graphic novels, short films, books, etc certainly can fill whatever gap is left by any shortcomings you preceive in the films. So enjoy for the sake of what they are, and LIVE WITH IT.
B00000JCOV|3.0|Slipknot isn't as great as said. 9 people isn't that great of an accomplishment. Mushroomhead has 9, also. And no, MH didn't rip off Slipknot. MH actually came out shortly before 'Knot. Then again, I'm not saying they outright suck. When I first heard them, I liked it. They are a great band to just break s*** to, y'know? But personally, they aren't a band to obsess over, just to have in your collection and listen to when you're stressed/pissed.

B000002QWD|5.0|Bing was an eclectic singer who dabbled extensively in many genres of music: Hawaiian, Irish, cowboy songs and of course, Christmas music, which is showcased here. This is an excellent introduction for those who don't have other Crosby CD's in your collection or who want to hear his &quot;holiday&quot; side. It contains his standard hits which have been recycled time and again on other anthologies. Most Bing-ologists will have all these songs in their collection, some of them many times over. But if you are new to Crosby, this is an acceptable choice and I guarantee that you will become hooked on Bing's magnificent voice. It's quite weak on his earlier work and it does contain some curious omissions, but then again, Bing didn't sing Christmas music much until the early 1940's. Yet there are some stellar songs included as well, like one of personal favorites, &quot;I'll Be Home For Christmas,&quot; One of his greatest recordings.<br />For the novice Crosby-Christmas fan, this set is perfect for several reasons: not only does it give you a fine overview of Bing's career, the sound quality is exceptional. The packaging of the set is excellent and it even includes some nicely written liner notes with a synopsis of Bing's Christmas songs and musical style, as well as an explanation of his tremendous musical impact upon the 20th century.<br />Other reviewers have complained about the sound quality on this set. I am puzzled at this criticism. I have most of these songs on casette, vinyl and some even on their original 78 and 45 issues. The sound quality here is quite acceptable and good on most tracks. This set will give you many hours of enjoyable listening and help you branch off into other Crosby CD's which includes his lesser-known vocals. Hopefully this collection will convince you that Bing's vocal mastery was unparalled. Then you can sample his earlier, jazz-influenced work during his Columbia years in the early 30's and branch off into his 20's work with the Rhythm Boys. But for the beginning Crosby listener, this is as good a choice as any. I highly recommend this set. Enjoy!Boys. But for the beginning Crosby listener, this is as good a choice as any. I highly recommend this set. Enjoy!
B000066NW0|1.0|Since this is NOT real music, it doesn't deserve to be rated on the same level as real music. Therefore, 0 stars all the way!!! Real music lasts forever. Just wait and see how many people will be listening to this in a year!

B0001DI0FI|2.0|When I saw the previews of the movie, I expected to see action and adventure. This movie was boring and I found myself wanting to leave the theater. The beginning of the movie started of strong, but as the movie wore on, it began to lose its momentum. If you want to get an historical perspective on how it was to live at sea back then, then this movie is an A+, if you want action and adventure get The Last Samurai.
B000002ITG|4.0|I am not a die-hard Led Zeppelin fan.  But I have come to have enormous respect for the quartet of Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham.  I have come to realize that the efforts of a great work ethic have produced some of the stuff that legends are made of - and Led Zep takes the cake.   As a 30 something music fan, I decided this would be one of my first entry points into the Led Zeppelin music library.   'Remasters' seemed like the perfect entry point - most of Zeppelin's great songs remastered on 2 CDs - plus a third 'Interviews' CD to get insight into the band.    This box set is very good.  It doesn't deliver that knockout punch or homerun, but it is very good.<br />First the packaging - It seems that nowadays everything that is above 2 CDs that is considered a &quot;Boxed Set&quot;. There really have become 2 categories of Boxed Sets. The first is a &quot;Classic Boxed Set&quot;. This comes in a covered box about the size of an LP and contains CDs (sometimes in jewel cases, sometimes just on the bottom of the box) and a book about the same size. The second type is more like a 5.5&quot; x 10&quot; hardcover book which I term &quot;Hardcover Box Set'. The CDs basically are stored in the hardcover binding and the book is in the middle. I much prefer what I call the Classic Boxed Set to the Hardcover format. The 'Led Zeppelin Remasters' set is a subset of Hardcover format.  The disappointing thing - no book in the middle.   Just two little booklets in the upper left corner.   I know Led Zeppelin has more comprehensive boxed sets (The Complete Set and the 4 CD set), but I still would have liked to see a little more here.<br />The music is on 2 CDs and basically is divided into Early Zeppelin and Late Zeppelin.   The first CD encompasses songs through the 'Led Zeppelin IV' album while the 2nd CD takes us to the end with songs from 'In Through the Out Door'.   I think the Zeppelin fan will be satisfied here.   I am more of a fan of the later stuff.  I was very disappointed to find that 'Fool in the Rain' was not included on this set.    However if you want to hear remastered versions of 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Kashmir', and 'Trampled Underfoot' - you won't be disappointed.   On a side note, I think those are the three best Zep songs.<br />The third CD is divided into 3 sections over 43 tracks.  The first section is a profile of the band which is 28 minutes long, but much of that is taken up by replaying songs such as Kashmir.  I think it would have been nicer to go deeper with the band profile.   The 2nd section is Station Liners and if you are a die-hard fan, this is perfect.  I wish more boxed sets had preserved this type of stuff.   The third section is individual Q&amp;A with Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, and John Paul Jones.  Much like the first section, it doesn't go as deep as I would have liked to hear.  The potential is there, it just doesn't deliver the depth.<br />All and all, I'm still happy I got this and it left me for wanting more.
B00013F38K|5.0|&quot;Work. Wander. Rest when I can.&quot; Shaolin priest Kwai Chang Caine starts his journey after he murders  the Chinese Emperor's cousin. I watched the re-run when I was a very small kid. I only recalled some cool fighting scenses, the flashbacks of Caine's Shaolin beginnings with Master Kan &amp; Master Po, and Caine always beats up the bad guys and continues his journey. I didn't appreciate much. <br />I purchased and watched this DVD set 20 years later. Wow, I couldn't believe that every single episode is telling brillant and intelligent philosopy. You wouldn't be surprised to find lots of good and rich dialogs from each episode as well. I really think this is a great TV series. As Master Kan tells the young Caine, &quot;Snatch the pebble from my hand. If you can, you're ready to go.&quot; I think after twenty years later, I can snatch the pebble and I'm ready to fully appreciate this Kung Fu series now. I look forward the second complete season coming out.<br />Picture quality in this DVD set is amazingly crystal clear. Sound is excellent and it also provides different subtitles. This complete first season DVD set contains 15 episodes in 3 double-sided disc as below:<br />[Disc 1: Side A]<BR>- Pilot Movie (original airdate: 2/22/72)<BR>- Documentary: The Tao of Caine (Production and Beyond)<br />[Disc 1: Side B]<BR>- King Of The Mountain (original airdate: 10/14/72)<BR>- Dark Angel (original airdate: 11/11/72)<BR>- Blood Brother (original airdate: 1/18/73)<BR>- Documentary: From Grasshopper to Caine (Creaing Kung Fu)<br />[Disc 2: Side A]<BR>- An Eye For An Eye (original airdate: 1/25/73)<BR>- The Tide (original airdate: 2/1/73)<BR>- The Soul Is The Warrior (original airdate: 2/8/73)<br />[Disc 2: Side B]<BR>- Nine Lives (original airdate: 2/15/73)<BR>- Sun And Cloud Shadow (original airdate: 2/22/73)<BR>- Chains (original airdate: 3/15/73)<br />[Disc 3: Side A]<BR>- Alethea (original airdate: 3/22/73)<BR>- The Praying Mantis Kills (original airdate: 3/29/73)<BR>- Superstition (original airdate: 4/5/73)<br />[Disc 3: Side B]<BR>- The Stone (original airdate: 4/12/73)<BR>- The Third Man (original airdate: 4/26/73)<BR>- The Ancient Warrior (original airdate: 5/3/73)<br />Overall, highly recommended!
B00004W50T|5.0|From the excellent harmony and musicianship to the lyrics and arrangements (though the latter are a slight bit dated), &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; is a journey through an America you simply cannot find anymore. This is the perfect album that could never be released today. If you want to hear talent, pick this up. Any individual member of the Band had more talent than nearly any band out there today.<br />Imagine five great players, three great singers, two great songwriters and mix it all up in a garish pink house in the Catskills, and you get &quot;Music From Big Pink.&quot;
B00005JMJ4|4.0|In her second directorial project Sofia Coppola shows that her skills as a director were no mere fluke. This time she delves into the art of character study focusing on the lives of has-been actor Bob Harris, and unhappy and recently married Charlotte. What they both have in common is their feelings of unfulfillment in their lives, and this is magnified by their stay in Tokyo, Japan.<br />Many complain of the lack of plot to this movie, but as I see it, the action of the movie lies not in what happens, but rather in how the characters interact with each other. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson play off each other well, as they look to each other to find something familiar to hold on to. These characters are definitely three dimensional, living and breathing on their own due to the excellent casting. This is probably Bill Murray's finest work due to the similarity of his character to himself. It is a shame that he didn't get the oscar for this part.<br />The screenplay for this movie was simple and real, focusing on subtleties of commuinication and interacting, while giving us a glimpse of Japan's urban lifestyle. One must remember that this is the theme of the movie. We actually feel for Bob and Charlotte as they are unable to connect emotionally with the people around them. This is emphasized by the fact that they can't speak the language. The foreign aspect of Japan becomes a metaphor for their feelings of displacement in their lives. Often is the source of many of the humourous events in the movie, but it is done is a respectful manner showing Sofia's love for this city and country. And so it is that in finding each other they also find a new appreciation for life in general.
B00012FXB8|1.0|Awful, awful, awful, awful.  It was rumoured prior to the making of Alien 3 that Ms. Weaver was unwilling to grind out more Alien sequels.  Perhaps this is why she helped co-produce this abomination - to kill the series!  Amazingly Ms. Weaver was honored with an Oscar nomination for her Ripley role in &quot;Aliens&quot;, who becomes a juggernaut of a protective mother when pushed (either to protect the marines lost in the maze of Aliens at the plant or protecting Newt.  Obviously the &quot;Alien 3&quot; filmmakers decided the mother daughter plot in that film didn't warrant further exploration and instead turned Ripley into a weakling.    This was a major psychological mistake since people who jump into the fray are generally very strong characters internally, so it's unlikely Ripley would have ever retreated in the scared bunny routine that begins this tale of so much woe. Pity, there was a lot more potential in the mother daughter relationship than this mess. <br />Furthermore, no matter what anyone suggests about this DVD version with additional footage,  there is NO satisfactory EXPLANATION given for a supposedly laid egg by the Alien Queen to GET INSIDE the ship when she was located in a crevice OUTSIDE the SHIP piloted by Lance Henriksen.  Not to mention Ripley DESTROYING the Queen's EGG SACK that the QUEEN actually SEPARATED HERSELF FROM before chasing after Ripley carrying Newt in the exploding air manufacturing plant.  You see it works like this, NO egg sack, NO eggs.  Sad, just sad.  Next, how the hell did the Face hugger from this egg that couldn't have existed get inside Ripley's hybernation chamber?  Remember that in &quot;Alien&quot; it dissolved through John Hurt's helmet to get to his face, yet Ripley's chamber cover had not been melted or damaged in any way, so how? HOW? HOW?  Regardless what you think of the acting ability of Dutton or Weaver, if a film begins on a screwed up premise (remember Highlander II and the orginal Highlander?) nothing theactors can do will save it.  Don't even get me started on Alien 4 -- a parasitic host zenomorph that combines at DNA level?  To quote another sci-fi great &quot;Don't insult my intelligence!&quot;
B00008J4P5|4.0|It just makes me sad and angry to read about how &quot;Meg is a bad drummer who has no sense of rhythm&quot; and how White Stripes is not a refreshing, excellent band, when IT IS! I had totally lost faith in any good bands coming out ever again but when I listened to this cd for the first time I couldn't help but saying aloud: god bless the white stripes.
0345347951|5.0|This is an absolutly wonderful book dealing with the asscention of the human race into &quot;the ultimate being&quot; their most perfect existance. It covers politcal and emotional subjects that some people may not agree with but I believe the point of this book is not to fall in love with the charecters but to reflect on your own actions. It is an eye opening book and vey well written in classic sci-fi form.
B000148KK2|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Diana Krall. I own all of her other CDS and love them all. This CD is just a huge disappointment. After listening to it 4 times, I cannot find one song that I really enjoy. I'm not sure if this is because Elvis Costello, her husband, wrote/cowrote 7 of the 12 tracks. I'm not a Costello fan, so I cannot say if these songs are like his other music--but it certainly is lacking the enjoyability of hers. True fans will buy this CD, but if you are new to Diana Krall's music, I would steer clear of this CD and get one of her previous ones.
B000050FEN|5.0|Most people here praise this movie for the creepiness, cleverness, and strong relationship portrayals.  What I haven't yet seen is anyone mention the strong literary message that all of that is wrapped around.  Namely, that there is so much wrong in the world that is carried out under the guise of right.  We see this problem in both opposing moral forces in this movie:  in the killer, who pretends to be doing the world a favor by revealing the evilness of sin, and in the police department, which follows the letter of the law more than the spirit that created said law, and by doing so, only helps the killer attain his goals.
B00006LI4S|4.0|You seem very concerned about the bass player's fingernails, is that something you;d like to share with us?<br />You said &quot; I was horrified to see my hero(s) look so human&quot;<br />You are not a pink floyd fan but an everyday moron, give your collection to someone who deserves it.
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie was Mel Gibson's first at directing, and it was really well made. The scenes were breathtaking, and the soundtrack was moving. The ending is one that you would never forget. The acting was outstanding. Mel Gibson's scottish accent was especially good. There is a reason this movie won so many awards.<br />Regarding historical accuracy, you dont go to hollywood to have a history lesson. You go to get entertained. Any average joe would know that hollywood always takes liberties when making their movies. This is a fictinal legendary potrayal of William Wallice, not a documentary. I am sure there are books and documentaries if you want to know about the real William Wallace, but dont bring your grudges to this and turn this movie into a bad movie because of that fact.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is probably the best Limp Bizkit Album. Their use of smack talk and Rap metal style earns them five stars. If you like hard rock you need to add this too your CD collection.
0385512104|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. For me, I loved it- it was perfectly human and perfectly written and it made me feel when reading it.
0385336810|5.0|I've recently read this book, for the reason that I wanted to read something light and romantic for a change. The secret is out...it was absolutely hilarious! I couldn't put the book down -Sophie Kinsella did a great job with Emma Corrigan, the quirky funny 20-something character along with her drama w/ her family, dull boyfriend, backstabber officemates, and romantic tensions with Jack.  If you need a good laugh and feel better for not lying about your underwear size, I highly recommend this book a must read.
0446310786|5.0|I consider To Kill a Mockingbird my favorite novel of all-time, and for good reason.  Like the film starring Gregory Peck, it shines as one of literature's finest Classics.  A must-read and a must-buy for any book lover!
B00000J7S8|5.0|I've had this album for a while now.. and still love it! &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot; proves to have no weak song, it's a perfect CD to listen to relax and unwind with red wine by the fire place.  Diana Krall has this very sultry sound..very soothing,  Absolutely cozy! My favourites are &quot;Let's Face The Music And Dance&quot;, &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot;, &quot;When I look in your eyes&quot;.  Diana Krall also brings all the emotions in &quot;Why Should I care&quot;...very touching.  Whether you consider Diana Krall's music as Jazz or not, this album is one of her best work, worth to have in everyone's collection.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|If Prince's 1999 comeback album, Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic, was more of a commerical disaster, then his next release would be his most daring and darkest album to date. The Rainbow Children is Prince's return to his jazz, rock, and funk roots. Though, it didn't sell that well like his previous works, the album has a big influence on his jazz-funk formula. It's like the continuation of his 1988, LoveSexy album. He sings a lot of spritual themes. While the lyrics sound weird and sometimes even spritual, the music speaks for itself. Take a listen to the jazzy, \\"Rainbow Children\\". The instruments played throughout the song would make a great jazz instrumental tune. The distorted bass voice of the narrator is kind of gripping and strange at the same time. Once again, Prince doesn't break any new ground. The Rainbow Children has some great soulful tracks. \\"The Work Pt.1\\" is the best one on here. It's a wonderful tribute to James Brown. I like how the drums, bass, guitars, and horns were mixed. The NPG band sounds just like the James Brown band, The JB's. \\"Family Name\\" is a funky number with a string of funky synthesizers and drums. \\"1+1+1=3\\" has a rhythmic yet off-the-wall vocals and guitars, that will have a listener's jaw drop with awe. \\"Everywhere\\" is an exciting, but up-tempo tune that has some amazing drum and horn work. It is very catchy. \\"Mellow\\" is a smooth jazz tune that is kind of clever, but exuberant as well. The finale, \\"Last December\\" is astonishing all the way through. It has a terrific musical structure. \\"Muse 2 The Pharoah\\" is a stroke of genuis. The poetry is 100% perfect. It's really his introduction to the neo-soul genre, in my opinion. \\"She Loves Me For Me\\" is a well-written love song. The guitar licks are sweet. There is just one thing I didn't like about this album. The silly, \\"Wedding Feast\\" is one of the songs I hate on this album. Prince should have omitted the song. The whole album is electrifying, but it's not as groundbreaking as Sign 'O' TheTimes, Purple Rain, or even his 1992 classic, The Love Symbol Album. It has a darker tone to it. It is often considered as his most controversial album. So, go buy it because this is a record that will broaden your musical horzions completely. It's a genuine piece of art. It has a deverse mix of ballads, without the sexual content and some funk/jazz jams. A+
B00006JDS4|5.0|i give this 5 starts because men who rape women deserve an awful death.
B000002KET|4.0|ahhhh black sabbath the band the started it all and this is one of their greatest albums.it gave me a bit of a headache cause the vocals were too loud to handle on the album and gave me a bit of a headache but the guitars and everything else managed to keep me from getting a HUGE headache.lots of great tunes after some of the greatest sabbath albums.sabbath bloddy sabbath is definitly the best song here.there is one light song called fluff and it was repetive but good.all the other songs were awesome too.this is one of the greatest sabbath albums of the 70's so if your a big fan of sabbath or heavy metal,this is one of the heavy metal albums you MUST own!!.
B000001FA4|5.0|Some rate Joshua Tree higher, but for me this is the quintessential must-have U2 album.  Every song is a classic, with the highlights Bad and Pride... you won't get any better than this
0156013983|5.0|I read this book a year ago with my French 4 Advanced Placement class.  It is still sitting on the head of my bed, because I have read it multiple times and refer to it often.  I have never been more inspired, nor more changed, by any one novel.  The lessons that are meant  to help children grow into admirable adults can teach us adults so much more.  I looked at everything differently once I finished reading this book.  I learned so many invaluable lessons that I will carry with me forever.  I am absolutely sure that I will read this to my children someday. The lessons I learned, from not judging someone by what they look like to getting my priorities straight, have forever changed the way I treat people and the way I live.  I believe I am more mature now because of the impact this book had on me.
B0000C9ZSV|5.0|Jimi Hendrix live at Berekeley is a lot better than what reviewers have been saying on Amazon. This show is pretty incredible and has a great flow to it. After the introduction, it starts out with an early version of Straight Ahead, which was dubbed Pass It On in it's early stages. This song is definitely welcome since I doubt it was performed often during the 1970 US tour. It has some intresting jams, but nothing mesmorizing (that's saved for later.) As I said before many songs flow into eachother, a good example of this would be Hey Baby (New Rising Sun) taking off right where Pass It On took off, this version of Hey Baby doesn't have any extended jams or improvised riffs, but it has a gorgeous beauty to it and is a highlight of this show for sure. Right after the last note of Hey Baby is played Lover Man starts, and I must tell this vesion is killer, it's electrifying and performed at a lightning pace, this one sure won over the crowd and should win you over as well. Next is Stone Free, yes I said Stone Free, I was really suprised that they played this since I've never heard Jimi and Mitch play this one with Billy Cox, it's a great version with an amazing solo, simply fantastic, and a higlight of this performance. Following is Hey Joe, sure we've all heard live versions of Hey Joe many times before, but this one has a blues flavor and a distictive power and aggression in its deliverence. Definitely a track that all Hendrix fans will enjoy. Next is I Don't Live Today, I've been waiting for another live version to come since the Experience Box Set, and my wish is granted. This version of I Don't Live Today is agressive, incredible, and thrilling in it's performance. And I should say better than the one on the box set. Surely a highlight. Next is Machine Gun, any Hendrix fan knows any version of Machine Gun is mind-boggling, exhilarating, and full of jams and revelations. I can't describe this in words, you have to listen to it. Highlight, I THINK SO!!! Then is Foxey Lady, yes Jimi does mess up the lyrics on this one, but I think it makes it more interesting to listen to. This version of Foxey really has a blues feel to it. You'll love it. Next is the Star Spangled Banner, not as long as the woodstock version, but just as enjoyable. Following is Purple Haze which is performed in at an aggressive tempo, I've never heard a version of Purple Haze that I don't enjoy, and this is no exception. Lastly, is Voodoo Child (Slight Return) this is one foot-stomping, barn-burning version, it jams. All of the solos are simply incredible. A Highlight, YES. Jimi Hendrix: Live At Bekeley is a powerful, electrifying, aggressive performance with a touch of grace and beauty to the songs performed. Sure it's only one of the two shows he played at Bekeley, and it isn't one of Hendrix's &quot;Super Shows&quot; (Woodstock, Fillmore East , Isle of Wight) but it's great in it's own right. <br />Highly Recommended! <br />(Especially if you're just starting out, let this be the first live album you buy)
B000002L5I|4.0|Kenny Wayne Shepherd is without a doubt a great guitarist with alot of potenital, but he copies Stevie Ray Vaughan too much. I think he is the next best young guitarist out their proving his skills with the debut album Trouble Is. He is a great blues guitarist with a style of both himself, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. I will not knock him down for having influences such as Jimi Hendrix, and Steive Ray Vaughan I think every guitarist should carry on the guitar trait but I dont agree with copying anybody's style. This album is full of blues/rock including songs such as (Long Gone), hendrix's cover I Dont Live Today, and True Lies. This album will soothe any guitarist weither you like Hendrix, or Steive Ray Vaughan this one is most defiently for you. The only reason I gave this a 4 is because his copying of Steive Ray Vaughan other than that he is the next best guitarist. My favorite song on the album is Somehow,Somewhere,Someway. Other than that go buy this album and enjoy. Highly Recomened!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I kept waiting for the movie to begin... and then it ended. In the meantime I had to endure a tiresome barrage of &quot;isn't Japan weird,&quot; pseudo-quirky, stereotypical tripe. Add to this the fact that I'm supposed to be empathizing with the two lead characters, both of whom are your average, everyday wealthy globetrotters, and the sum is a movie that I could barely sit through. There wasn't even any nudity relief.<BR> <BR>Makes me wonder what the big reviewers would have said if the director didn't have a famous last name. Or what would have been said if the movie had given a different ethnic group the same belittling treatment.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|D12's second effort is definitely worth your money (although it took me two listens to realise how great this cd is). if you see it at a cd shop and are pondering whether to pick it up, my advice is to cop it. no joke this cd is tight. props to em and his crew once again
B00008PX8P|5.0|I am giving it 5 stars for reasons many people have written already about. I will add these: excellent renditions of Whole Lotta Love (Knebworth) - the best Whole Lotta on record, Achilles Last Stand (now I rate this song among the 6 best of LZ), Since, Ocean, Kashmir, Stairways. Jimmy's movements on the stage are extremely good and let us mention it at last, for this is a video not just an audio recording. The way Page moves in Over the Hill, Achilles etc.  is a pure joy to watch. One major minus: Why on earth no No Quarter in this collection ? One of 6 best LZ songs. More feedback: Plant is a great man and a perfect vocal, Bonham and John Paul Jones are awsome in providing rythm.<BR>A post scriptum. I talked to Coverdale on an occasion and I asked him, as a souvenire instead of an autograph, I asked him a question: What do you think about Jimmy Page as a person ? Oh, I love him very much! - was Coverdale's reply. I think Page is the best rythm guitarist there has been, and precisely because I put rythm above all other elements in music Led Zeppelin is my favourite rock band of all time (JS Bach is my favourite classical act for the same reason). Enjoy this collection, there are moments in it I frankly consider a proof of God's presence in this world, because such talent can be only derived from His might.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation is a stylized version of real life. Two Americans find a peculiar kind of romance in Tokyo, shuffling from their hotel rooms to the hotel lounge to a night on the town. No matter where they go, there's a sense of loneliness. After all, they are both leaving soon, so there's no way they establish anything permanent while they're together. It's an ironic moment for both characters.<br />All of this stuff --- the mood, the characters' feelings, and their actions --- is filmed at the pace of real life. It's unlike  most films, where the boring parts of life are ditched, leaving only the exciting stuff. It's as if the director wanted to take a close look at being bored and out of place. That's not everyone's idea of a good time at the movies, so this film had received a mixed reaction.<br />But it's worth a look --- or maybe two. Underneath it all, it's a romantic comedy. If you watch it closely and get into the rhythm of it, you'll see a unique movie that takes the standard romantic comedy conventions and flips them upside down.
0375758992|5.0|This is an interestingly rich book about small, real lives in big Africa. Fuller captures the continent from the eyes of a white, definitely not rich, farm family around the time of the collapse of colonialism and the rise of strange despotism. There are no apologies for racism, for warmth, for mistakes, for family, for violence, for nature, for politics, for life. She takes you to hot, humid, dusty, rainy, cold Africa, makes you live there, makes you feel hot, humid, dusty, rainy, cold. I lived there; I recognized the feelings she was presenting as soon as I understood her quirky, understatedly complex style.<br />  The picture on the jacket (ruined by Amazon's marketing in the picture of the book on this website) is the best photo I've ever seen on a book. Before I read, I thought it was just a quirky, stylish picture. After I read a few chapters, I could see it lists the style and story exactly. A black-and-white of a scrubby, dirty stone wall, stained, rutted road, littered with unkempt grass and detritus. You can smell the sheep, the lions, the pee, the dampness. A little girl, dressed in a scruffy playsuit, hair discombobulated by play and let drift by a mother with love but other things to accomplish, grins noisily just inside the photograph. The photographer caught perfectly the solipsism, trust, joy and candor of her. She exists as if someone pasted her picture on the picture of the background, but clues inform you the image fits seamlessly. Then you notice that the wall is where she lives, and that her comfort is because she knows where she is.<br />  Ms. Fuller's child lives in Africa. She only has adventures that involve living, not a grand romance. It's just that her family's living is in Africa, not Montana or London. Africa shapes just living into small heroism. It's a small great book.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Truman Capote's little gems of insight about the proper rules of grammar make this movie one of my favorites. I watch Murder by Death for the subtle and not-so subtle puns and language twists.
0800141660|5.0|I love movie adaptations of Jane Austen classics. I don't like reading her books, because they are too lengthy (eg. Mansfield Park), but watching movies based on them is a whole different story. <br />Ang Lee added his delicate touch to this one. The story flows on scene by scene smoothly, and he had a great cast. Emma Thompson is able to show Eleanor to be a strong-willed woman, introverted, but nevertheless sensible. Kate Winslet gave a strong performance as the impulsive, free-spirited Marianne. The contrast provided by both actresses is what drives the movie. After all, Marianne is Sense, for she relies on the senses of her heart, and Eleanor is Sensibility. Alan Rickman, as always, gives us a spectacular portrayal of the Colonel - wise and old, and deeply in love with Marianne. We feel and at the same time, comprehend his concern for Marianne, and at once, he gains our sympathy as well as respect. <br />Hugh Grant is disappointing as usual. I'm not a fan of Hugh, so perhaps I'm being biased here, but I find his stammering, and blinky eyes really annoying (the guy can't even speak right!). Half the time he is mumbling, and his enunciation is so poor it is hard to catch what he is saying. <br />If Hugh doesn't get too much on your nerves, and if you love a little bit of romance, drama, and comedy, this is definitely your cup of tea. At some points, it had me close to tears, while at others, I couldn't help but smile. I love the contrasting personalities of Charlotte and her husband, as well as the direct similarities between Charlotte and her mother, Mrs Jennings. Brilliant. <br />Care for a cuppa, anyone?
B00005JMEW|4.0|Writer-director Quentin Tarantino indulges his love for revenge flicks and martial arts movies in the story of a former member of an assassination squad (Uma Thurman) who seeks revenge against her former teammates (Viveca Fox and Lucy Liu) after they wipe out the members of her wedding party.  The result is highly watchable, but somehow sterile and unsatisfying.  <br />Tarentino's films have always been more about style and homage than substance, but with &quot;Kill Bill&quot; he threatens to tip over into self-parody.  Has he been reading too many worshipful articles about himself?  His films have always been exercises in hip and cool, but this one seems especially self-consciously so.  The characterization of previous films is gone, replaced by iconic cartoon cutouts that are motivated by the demands of stereotype.  His dialogue is always cited as a strength, full of quirky details and impassioned defenses of odd world views.  In KB, however, the dialogue is simply terrible.  The actors are given ridiculous things to say, full of posturing and bluster and stilted syntax.  None of the profanity sounds organic or natural; each F-word seems as carefully arranged and artificial as a flower arrangement.  <br />What does work is the action, which comprises the majority of the film.  Tarentino may be all about style, but he is a master of style.  So for me, watching this film was a schizophrenic experience.  I would be caught up in it, then jarred out of it again by a particularly bad piece of dialogue or gimmicky technique whose only reason for being there is that someone did the same thing in a 60s kung-fu movie.
B00005JMEW|4.0|The movie is a joyride of pure action-packed wonderment, with blood on-screen measured in gallons per second.  Uma Thurman has never looked better, as does most of the rest of the cast.  Beautifully shot and lit.<br />This DVD kind of falls through, however; the quality of sound and video is just fine, but there's essentially nil for extras.  Trailers for other Tarantino films, and some very throwaway videos for the musical group playing at the beginning of the hotel scene.<br />With all the extras on Reservoir Dogs, I expect more of Tarantino.  Wait for a special edition of the film, hopefully containing both volumes packaged together.  If you liked the first one, you'll probably dig the second... though a three-hour long cut with the two movies together would be ideal.  Can that come out on DVD, Mr. Tarantino?
B0000DZ3IG|2.0|How could anyone produce a sound track of &quot;Love Actually&quot; and not include Olivia Olson's  &quot;All I want for Christmas&quot; is beyond me.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|From all the movie critic reviews, I thought I was getting either an artsy film or a comedy.  I got nothing instead.  This is the most pointless and boring film I've seen since &quot;About Schmidt&quot;.  I know where Coppola was going with the film, as I have been stuck alone in Tokyo and other foreign cities numerous times, but she just wasn't able to pull it off.  The only thing she got right with this one was the quirkiness of modern Japanese pop culture.  The plot was too loose, and the only funny scene was the one in the exercise room.  This was an extremely disappointing film, particularly since it got so many rave reviews from critics.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The title of this film also happens to describe the feeling I got after watching it and then reading all the glowing reviews about it. There is some nice cinematography, a few insights about Japanese culture, and an out of character (but one-note) performance from Bill Murray. Otherwise this movie is a complete waste of time, with no plot to speak of, characters I couldn't care less about, and observations on life and stardom that have all been made a million times before. But then again, maybe something's been lost in translation...
B00001OH7M|5.0|It is the fusion of music genres that makes this work outstand among other 1969 albums.Is it pure rock or is it a mix of folk and glam?David Bowie brought us this gift with his first hit ever,Space Oddity in it.It  was a good sign of great things to come.The Great Thin Duke spawned gems such as Don't Sit Down and Occasionally as well.It is a 5!
B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic is an excellent example of grand movie-making at its finest! James Cameron perfectly balanced historical accuracy (many historians have stated that the sinking is shown accurately here for the first time) with a wonderful love story to bring in modern audiences and make them really relate to this oft told tale. Cameron rigthly aimed for a classic hollywood, epic feel to his tale of doomed love aboard the most famous ship in history. His success is obvious from the films incredible world-wide success, and amazing and much deserved 11 Oscar wins!<br />Much of the films success lies in intelligent casting - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent and have wonderful chemestry as the star-crossed lovers. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, especially the ever reliable Kathy Bates as Molly Brown.<br />The sinking is an edge-of-your seat experience so effectively done that you will feel like you are on the ship! Of course the special effects are great and the music is appropriately wistful and heart-breakingly poignant.<br />I always get a kick out of reading the bad reviews the silly little critics of the movie write on this site. Who are they? Always nerds. Usually teenage or twenty something pimply  boys, although occassionaly a sad-sack older nerd, and sometimes a pathetic, female desperately needing attention. Have you ever met one of these people in real life? They are always obnoxious and unlikeable. They uaually have an excess of body hair (even the females)  are usually paunchy, always have rancid breath, and have usually never been in love in their sad little lives, hence their impatience with the love story in Titanic. They really should go floss and shut up.<br />It kills them that Titanic is number one, and baffles them how their favorite films, usually some Star Wars opus, can't seem to measure up.<br />We'll have some real fun listening to their impotent ranting when Titanic is re-released in theaters soon and makes another mint! (Hee Hee)!<br />Titanic the BEST MOVIE ever, forever! Can't wait for the special edition dvd!Hee Hee)!<br />Titanic the BEST MOVIE ever, forever! Can't wait for the special edition dvd!
B0000630YA|5.0|&quot;Welcome to my nightmare. I think you're gonna like it. I think you're gonna feel you belong.&quot; So starts out the first track as Alice Cooper invites us into his classic concept album of the seventies. It begins with the soft picking and strumming of guitar strings accompanied by the slow tapping of a cymbal, and continues as Alice joins the instruments, singing in a soft, quiet voice as if to avoid waking a sleeping person. Gradually the song picks up pace and volume as Alice introduces us to his &quot;breakdown&quot; and opens the door to the rest of the journey through this album.<br />After you've entered the album through the first song, &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare,&quot; you'll find youself in the second track, &quot;Devil's Food.&quot; Don't worry, the devil's not there. At least not in person. No, you'll find yourself in far better company than Satan, for Vincent Price awaits you as the curator of a deadly reptile and insect museum. As the voice of this master actor of old black and white horror films guides you on the tour, you come to realize that you are the &quot;food&quot; being led into the next song, &quot;The Black Widow,&quot; to be eaten by a spider. <br />If you've escaped song three, you might find refuge in song four, &quot;Some Folks.&quot; But I doubt it. Here we find Alice pleading, &quot;Baby, come on and save me.&quot; But the lyrics are ambiguous. Does he want to be saved from celabacy? &quot;Some folks crave a blue lady... I'm just no good without it, I'm not a man at all.&quot; Or does he want to be rescued from the nightmare he's caught in? &quot;Some folks love to feel pain, some folks wake up every morning. Some folks live for no reason, some folks die without a warning.&quot; The message isn't clear, except for the fact that the character in the song is not in a happy predicament.<br />And don't assume that song five, &quot;Only Women Bleed,&quot;  will save you. Of course, you'll be better of if you're the man in the song, who &quot;smokes and drinks and don't come home and all.&quot; But if you're the abused women, you just get to bleed on those occasions when he does come home.<br />But you could make your way to the &quot;Department Of Youth,&quot; track six, an anthem of youth rebellion against adult authority. Perhaps you could hide among the juvenile delinquents as they sing along with Alice about how they've got the power. (The Summerhill Children's Choir join Cooper on vocals)<br />But when the department of youth closes and you have nowhere to go but song seven, &quot;Cold Ethyl,&quot;  you might want to walk fast and get out of there quickly. The song is only two minutes and fiftyone seconds long; but for those three minutes you'll be doing husband and wife things with Ethyl. That wouldn't be a problem, if not for the fact that the reason Ethyl is cold is because she's a corpse.<br />In &quot;Years Ago,&quot; track eight, you'll mentally regress to your childhood. You'll long for that era. You'll think you're there, yet, somehow know you're not. &quot;I'm a little boy. No, I'm a great big man. You will realize that all your &quot;friends went home - years ago.&quot; You'll admit that &quot;all my toys are broken. And so am I inside, mom.&quot; You'll hear your mother calling for you to come home as you wander into the next track. <br />Song nine is &quot;Steven.&quot; He's you. He's the one trapped in this album; this nightmare. He's struggling to grow up. Part of this unhappy adventure is the struggle, in song nine, to accept the death of a loved one, most likely Steven's mother. He keeps hearing her, or someone else calling his name. The lyrics of this song might lead you to believe that Steven is losing the battle against the demons of his mind.<br />But then you wake up in song ten, &quot;The Awakening.&quot; You're in the basement and don't know how you got there. You think that perhaps you're sleep walking. You get up from the chair to look for your wife. You followa trail of blood and realize it's dripping from your hands. Is Ethyl your wife? Is she dead because of you? Did you kill your mother? Are you the reason that only women bleed? <br />But then song eleven, &quot;Escape,&quot; brings freedom from the nightmare. After this song, you can exit the record and re-enter reality. You can finally pinch yourself and know that it was all just a rock and roll dream. You're safe at home in front of your stereo.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|Scarlett Johansson proves herself an actress of the highest caliber in this simple, but profound film. She says more with her eyes and facial expressions than with her lines. On top of that, she is a beautiful young woman. Bill Murray plays the lost middle-age man to the hilt, maybe going overboard a bit with the sadness routine. We sometimes get a slight hint of his SNL wiseguy persona. I resisted the feeling that this unlikely pair were in love until she knocks on his door and hears the other woman's voice. The look of hurt in her eyes expressed her feelings perfectly. This is not a great movie, but it is worth watching at least once. Like another reviewer, I recommend only renting.
B000002MG1|5.0|Well, the last reviewer CLEARLY showed his lack of knowledge on REM or his good taste. So, where to start?<br />REM had hit their high point twice in the past. The first time was MURMUR, an indie rock classic that was influential to many bands. The second time was their commercial breakthrough, DOCUMENT, when a large amount of confused people turned &quot;The One I Love&quot; into a hit. Now, AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE has become a melancholy classic.<br />Track by track, this is REM's best album lyrically, and it benefits from the reliance on acoustic instruments. &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot; and &quot;Nightswimming&quot; are among REM's best songs. &quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot;, &quot;Monty Got A Raw Deal&quot; and &quot;Find The River&quot; are probably REM&quot;s best songs that nobody knows about. If you are an REM fan and you don't own this, buy it as soon as possible.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the first aired episode of this show two years ago and dismissed it: characters enjoying a camaraderie that hadn't been fully established yet, and a bizarre Wild West in Space setting that struck me as derivative and gimmicky. So I tuned out -- as I suspect a lot of viewers did. And Fox probably used me as a statistic to justify cancelling the show. Little did I know this episode wasn't the pilot, which did a great job of easing viewers into the universe. Little did I know Fox showed the pilot just before cancelling the show, effectively screwing any continuity they could've built for viewers. And little did I know how damn good this show was, until its release on DVD. Not since BABYLON 5 has something this fresh and exciting come down the sci-fi airwaves. Intelligence, humor, action, emotion, great F/X -- FIRELY has it all. Aside from their right-wing wacko news channel, the cancellation of FIREFLY is yet another reason to hate Fox. Do yourself a favor and watch these 13 episodes. Then let's keep our fingers crossed for next year's movie. Stay shiny!
B00005JLSE|3.0|Chicago was a decent movie with some good music.  The story is a little simplistic and nothing that hasn't been done before, but the  fact that this is a &quot;modern&quot; musical makes the film somewhat unique.<br />The acting is just &quot;okay&quot;, and there are some parts where the lip-syncing is pretty obvious--a big distraction.  The music was quite good; however.<br />Where Chicago stumbles a bit is in the uninteresting, simplistic story line.  This is almost redeemed by wrapping the story in it's musical elements, but not quite.  Another problem is that the story, once again, in the modern Hollywood way, glorifies a couple of murders and attempts to turn them into the &quot;good guys&quot;.  This is a common Hollywood formula that is pretty tired at this point and illustrates why movies such as &quot;Sea Biscuit&quot; are so much better.<br />Remove the musical elements of Chicago and you end up with a boring, predictable, 8th grade level story-line.
B00005U8EM|4.0|Yes, this is an entertaining movie, very well made, and has a lot of funny variables on the recurring events of GROUNDHOG DAY.  Murray is good in his role; Andie McDowell even better.  But I can't call it a &quot;classic&quot; because there are times when enough is enough.  With no explanation for the time warp or its resolution, it's hard to understand just why Bill is reliving each day.  Even as the story progresses and Bill finally becomes a decent, caring man, we've had to wade through a lot of redundancy that the screenplay didn't necessitate.  But I'd be a Scrooge to say it isn't a happy entertainment.  Some of the supporting characters in Puxta..whatever? are fun, and it's unique the way director Harold Ramis alters some of the recurring scenes, especially obnoxious Stephen Tobolowsky's, Hi I'm (I've forgotten his name already).<br />Admittedly enjoyable, but not the &quot;best comedy ever!&quot;
B00009MGQL|2.0|He may be one of the best guitar players around, but he needs the firm hand of a band to guide him in the proper direction.  Really brilliant people sometimes make big mistakes...and keep making them.  <br />This brilliant rock guitarist does nothing for rock.  I can't understand this apparent love affair he has with techno, since techno A) saw it's hey-day in the mid to late 90's and B) lacked the ability to carry the same emotion, depth, and richness that other forms of music, especially rock and blues can and do.  This cd doesn't really break new ground in that genre, and it really doesn't rescue techno from it's slow decline.  Whereas &quot;Guitar Shop...&quot; anticipated the rise of techno music (a much better cd), this album merely rehashes every distortion that's ever come from the studio.<br />Where are the solos?  I found it so hard to distinguish a guitar &quot;sound&quot; from some other kind of &quot;sound&quot; at times.  Maybe this is what he wants, but if he thinks that this is enough to satisfy his long time fans (or new fans fond of his early work), it's not.  Maybe if he had invested some time into lyrics NOT about cars, this cd would be a LITTLE better off.  As it stands, I feel that Beck is merely toying with us.  He's taken the time to record an album, but has done everything possible to turn it into a joke.  Not very nice.
0156027321|5.0|Simply put, if you do not believe in a higher power, this story will make you believe. Even though Pi experiences the most incredible of circumstances, he remains faithful and that faith, as well as respect for his traveling companion, helps him survive. The lessons written here are applicable to anyone's life as a human being. The first quarter of the book is a bit slow with a lot of setting up of the story. If you can make it through, you will come to read a truly inspirational and touching story. This is easily one of the best books I have ever read.
B00005KFUM|5.0|my favorite song is bliss, but they are brilliant.  Muse sound like a futuristic band with there drums, guitars, and some songs have orgins.  They way matt bellamy looks at the world is very artistic like this ablum, probably the best muse album
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Being a big fan of Robert Johnson, I was thrilled to hear that virtuoso guitarist (and legend in his own right) Eric Clapton decided to do a cover album of 14 Robert Johnson songs. My thought was: 'Well, I'm either going to love this or I'm going to hate it...' Fortunately for me it was the former! Clapton has Johnson down to a T --- from his falsetto voice, wailing moans and of course his superb guitar licks. In my opinion, the songs 'Come On In My Kitchen', 'They're Red Hot', 'Hell Hound On My Trail', '32-20' &amp; 'When You've Got A Good Friend' are the best. But the truth is, fans of the blues &amp; Johnson won't be disappointed by any of them. If ever a true musical genius like Robert Johnson 'The King of the Delta Blues Singers' needed a contemporary re-rendering with a little more umph and pizazz --- Eric Clapton shows why he was the ideal choice to do it!
B0001ENYKS|5.0|I first heard this album last evening. I was exhausted from working on two papers and grading fifty others, and I'm planning my wedding, which is in two weeks. Three seconds into the first song, I took off my shoes, grabbed my bridesmaid's 11-year-old sister, and started dancing like a maniac around their house. Being 38 years old, I don't do that sort of thing very often.<br />Yeah. This is a cool, cool record. Buy it if you think you may not mind taking part in uncontrollable dancing in other people's homes. Thanks, Nathan, for the experience.
B000002JKA|5.0|To stay from overredundance I'll say that the instrumentals in this album are amazing, but that has been constituted by the other reviews of this album.<BR>Many people are known to dislike vocalist's singing, but I would rather say that he is a very talanted singer.  Unlike most vocalists in metal he is a professional, which makes him sound significantly different.  His highest notes are quite amazing, and he does realize that he cannot go below a certain note and stays away from it, while many metallists just turn to a scream or a roar, which has nothing to do with singing and you cannot understand a single word they say.<BR>I would personally give this album a 4.5, but the choices are either 4 or 5.  My reasoning is that the vocalists managed to mess up certain parts of 2 tracks, but that is my opinion.  Most people I know say that he does everything flawlessly.<br />If you are new to progressive metal, this is the first thing you want to give a try.  If you are just new to Dream Theater but already are a fan of Progressive Metal, then this you definetly want as it will hit the top of your lists.
0613279816|2.0|First of all let me tell you that this book could be written in 100 pages less, taking that little part away, how could ten art experts buy a fake copy of a paint. They don't study how to recognize a fake?<br />The book has too many stories and everybody make wrong things and they go against all the laws and nobody does nothing, that is unreal.<br /><br />S P O I L E R: don't read the next text unless you already read the book<br /><br />How can anybody steal one million dollars and no one does nothing? Or even worse, they forgive the thieves just for the value of the real paints. That is pathetic.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Since the plot of \\"Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World\\" is easily available on this website, I will reserved my comments for the DVD. IMO it is wonderful! I am one who seeks out widescreen DVDs rather than full screen, and I found the picture and sound quality to be nearly identical to what I experienced upon first seeing the movie in the theatre. Those who found the movie \\"too dark\\" or had trouble understanding some of the dialogue will no doubt have the same criticism of the DVD presentation, but neither were a problem for me. The bonus material is excellent in my opinion. I particularly enjoyed the made-for-DVD documentary \\"The Hundred Days,\\" which takes the viewer behind the scenes of the making of the movie, and \\"In The Wake of O'Brian,\\" a shorter documentary where Weir answers some of the questions about the focus of the movie that bothered many devotees of the canon. There are also short documentaries that cover the battle scenes, audio effects, and the storm scene, which are of especial interest to movie buffs. There is a companion booklet that would be helpful for those not familiar with the series and/or the careers of Peter Weir and Patrick O'Brian. The small map included is a little gimicky in my opinion, but your children or grandchildren might like it! I feel that the two-disc set is well worth the few extra dollars, especially for those of us who are interested in the art and science of movie production.
B000002KB8|5.0|Some albums make you wonder if a band had something more than their own ideas behind writing great songs.  I'm not talking about the ideas of other people or record companies, but a spiritual force.  In Black Sabbaths' case, it may have been Satan or God.  <br />There aren't that many great bands out there, so it's important to find the ones who are.  Not only did Black Sabbath define heavy metal, they did it in a time when it was very unacceptable to speak of the things they did.  The songs were not written for radio consumption because of the length.  <BR>Moreover, they didn't have the benefit of MTV and high dollar promotions that exist today.  They had to reach fame with their creativity and live shows.  These guys worked their butts off.<BR>Also, it was a big risk to write songs about darkness and evil, with gloomy music to back it, in a time when the trend was being positive with the whole peace and love hippie movement.  Black Sabbath blazed a path of nihilism that still exists today.  They lived in reality more so than any of the hippies with their utopian dreams.<br />Ozzy Osbornes' voice was the best it has ever been on this debut recording.  The vocals got higher from this point on.  The higher his voice got, the less it matched the heavy riffs and dark lyrics.  Tony Iommi's simple and slow riffs embody the power of the electric guitar.  The music was so heavy and loud it could shake every bone in your body.<br />The opening track, \\"Black Sabbath,\\" is a song that no Goth band has ever been able to top.  The way the guitar hits in unison with the bell and then hums go right through the listener.  In other words, it's simply powerful.  \\"The Wizard\\" is a strange track because of the harmonic, but has an overall druggy feeling.  The following song, written in four parts, locks you into the album and carries you away.  \\"N.I.B.\\" will leave you shaken.  The following songs are not the best Black Sabbath has written, but still very easy to listen to that help thelistener transition back into reality.<br />Lester Bangs may have been correct when he called Black Sabbath the first Catholic rock band.  It scared people with the Satanic songs and then turned around with a Christian message.  The switch in themes more than likely confused most people.  Their spirituality mixed with drugs created something very unique, even if they didn't get any help from any higher powers.  But, it's hard to imagine any mortal men having so much impact on music and society in general.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Okey-dokey . . . I became a No Doubt fan way back whenever because I liked their funky-fun ska-style music circa _No Doubt_ and _Beacon Street Collection_, so Rocksteady sort of took me by surprise.  &quot;Hella Good,&quot; &quot;Making Out,&quot; and &quot;Underneath It All&quot; were enjoyable, but some of the songs were just a little too blinged-out for me, and the entire album was almost completely devoid of any ska elements from their previos releases. Even Return of Saturn still had a lot of ska beats and horns in it.  The only song I could really do without was &quot;Hey Baby.&quot; Just not my cup of tea. <br />I guess I'm disappointed mostly because I was expecting ska (it's called &quot;Rocksteady&quot; for crying out loud!) and I got some blingin' r&amp;b party music instead.
B00005ASIL|5.0|Ian Anderson's hand-picked version of \\"The Very Best of Jethro Tull\\" is an honest beginner's manual, a history lesson, a modest musical snapshot. There is a difference between the terms \\"greatest hits\\" and \\"best of\\"-the former refers to the successful singles, while the latter refers to songs that represent a band at their high point whether those songs were popular or not. This 20-track, single disc collection excels due to its honesty and Anderson's refusal to become a hypocrite; as he explains in his humorous liner notes, he stopped bashing compilations because he realized that half of his own CD collection consists of best-of and/or hits packages. \\"The Very Best of Jethro Tull\\" does its best to describe various points in the band's lexicon to the lucky new listener. There are moments that range from the legendary (`Aqualung,' a shortened `Thick as a Brick,' `Locomotive Breath'), then to what Anderson aptly calls \\"spectacular duds\\"-from the critically dismissed (the short masterpiece `Too Old To Rock N' Roll: Too Young To Die'), to some pieces from the later parts of Tull's career (`Roots To Branches,' `Steel Monkey'--headbangers were horrified that Tull won a Grammy for Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Performance). Some pieces of the Jethro Tull puzzle have been excluded however; albums such as \\"A\\" and \\"Under Wraps\\" may not have been successful but are still noteworthy points in the band's thirty-plus years; some of these albums may be shown on the front cover collage but are missing from the gallery of album covers in the CD booklet. But perhaps they are being reserved for a worthwhile sequel.<br />The tracks are not in chronological order for once, but rather the sequencing has been chosen to make a balanced tapestry of different signatures, moods, and themes, which is much more creative than simply putting the songs in the order they were released. Some songs have been newly edited but that doesn't make them any less enjoyable; Anderson compares the reasons for the edits to the reason one might castrate a family dog. Aside from all this, there's little more one can say without repeating himself; \\"The Very Best of Jethro Tull\\" is an honest compilation, and thankfully doesn't tout itself as an \\"essential\\" history disc.e edits to the reason one might castrate a family dog. Aside from all this, there's little more one can say without repeating himself; \\"The Very Best of Jethro Tull\\" is an honest compilation, and thankfully doesn't tout itself as an \\"essential\\" history disc.

0385336810|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and the Shopaholic series.  I finished this book in a day and laughed out loud throughout it.  I even woke my husband up a few times laughing!  This was the best!
B000148KK2|4.0|This is the best Krall CD since her first. At last she is doing something different and interesting. Her last two studio CD's were really good at putting me to sleep because they were too smooth and over produced. This is an excellent production with very smart jazz/blues tunes. The only problem I have is that its like listening to an Elvis Costello CD.Dont get me wrong Elvis Costello is an excellent song  writer and has produced some excellent music, but his voice really gets overpowering like a knife scratching on a dinner plate. Hearing Diana's voice  taking his place is a breath of fresh air, but I cant give it five stars because of the Costello style being coppied. Anyway for music I give it 90% and sound it gets 92%.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I don't like the SE releases, the original is just better. I wish they'd release them in their original form and let people decide themselves. The other thing about this release is that it doesn't even say Special Edition on the cover and I think it should. It seems everything released after the original releases on VHS that Lucas Films have lost their attention to detail.
B000003TA4|5.0|Ah, Nevermind. Nirvana at it's best, with 13 wonderful, catchy songs with great lrics, climaxing with the first song, the anthem, the hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit.<br />Before ending this, I gotta ask one thing to &quot;a music fan&quot;, from Houston, Texas. Where in any rule book in Rock history does it say that Rock songs have to have a guitar solo? Huh? I don' think I saw that anywhere, did you? And who cares if it's easy or not? That was the beauty of Nirvana. They took something insanely easy, and mad something great out of it. And if they doesn't show for a halfway decent - great band, nothing does.
B000002TPS|4.0|Megadeth went for a different sound than in Countdown, by making themselves  more melodic.  This goes especially in the vocal department, with Dave making his finest effort - he obviously poured a lot of passion into them.  The solos are great and technical as always, included at the right times, and Dave's more melodic solos are really beginning to shine on this CD (the way they're structured is original and creative).  (Marty's melodies great as always)  The choruses are really well done, all instruments intricately timed and arranged , something Megadeth has not done so well before and Ellefsons' bass performance is very pleasing (yes, you can hear the bass and he does some interesting stuff with it, unlike some bands).  The production is fantastic, too.  Most songs have different guitar sounds to them in certain parts, and in this way the production helps songs stand out and express themselves more. The 1 star knockoff is for tracks 5-7, which aren't anything special.  Again, the vocals really set this one apart because their melody really changes how the band is heard, and I guess they also set tone for the more melodic guitars.  Dave and co. also throw in nice riff changes, licks and bridges to keep songs dynamic and fresh.  The lyrics are more personal this time around, centering more about pain and lessons in life.  Overall, this is absolutely essential to any Megadeth fan.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Do not pay attention to the amazon.com editorial review. First of all, they do not even list all of the band members--they leave out kon artis. Second, they do not have their information correct on the production--proof did not produce good die young, mr. porter did. I refuse to listen to a review that doesn't even know anything about the group. <br />Now for the good stuff. This is much better than d12's first album. The entire group has stepped up in terms of lyricism. Denaun Porter (kon artis) produces three of his own tracks for this album which are a significant addition. All of the outside producers contributed some good beats and of course, eminem brought out the best of the beats. This album is very eclectic in terms of beats and rhyme patterns, cadence, and verse set-ups. All of D12 really stepped up to the plate. Some highlights are Git up, Loyalty, How Come, Bitch, and Get my Gun. Dre's beat is also hot but that is to be expected. This album does not surpass eminem's last lp, but it is a 5 star rating none the less. Go buy it!
B0000025ZK|3.0|There is nothing really wrong with this cd, but it lacks all the other influences that make pink floyd good.<br />I think David Gilmour is at his best when he's working with others and so it just dosen't work on a solo effort.<br />That's not to say it won't stop me from picking up his _other_ solo effort next time i find it.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|I realize this was based on a fantasy novel and was not a 100% pure Tim Burton creation, however BIG FISH misses the boat.<br />Lavish production and great cinema techniques can't save this film from being just a random mish-mash of fantasy dream elements strung together in the semblance of a story.<br />There is no empathy for characters and the story just gets old real quick.<br />After about an hour you just want to turn it off and go do something else as the movie does not &quot;suck you in&quot;.<br />I get the impression the original creator for BIG FISH has spent their life with a notebook by their bed and whenever they wake up in the middle of the night from a dream, quickly mkes notes about the dream before they forgot them.<br />Then years later took that notebook of random dream elements and tried to weave a story around them.<br />My wife and I waited for this movie with anticipation but were deeply dissapointed.<br />One always hates writing a bad movie review because it is clear how much work and effort went into making it..... but like they say &quot;There are no E's for effort in the real world... the only thing that matters is the final result&quot;.<br />Despite the hard work and effort that went into making this movie (which I can respect)... it is simply forgetable and not entertaining.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|This was probably one of the best Wrestlemanias of all time. There was really only one terrible match and it was not expected to be a 5 star match.<br />U.S. Title- Big Show vs. John Cena-  This match was a good opener.  The pace was just a little slower than most due to Big Show.  John Cena's usual antics also made the match entertaining and the crowd was on.  3.5/5.<br />Fatal Four-Way World Tag Titles- RVD & Booker T vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade vs. La Resistance-  Good match with false finishes and blind tags.  A lot of action but a hard format to have a great match.  3.5/5.<br />Chris Jericho vs. Christian- Awesome match with nonstop action.  Style reminded me a little of a faster Michaels vs. Jericho from WMXIX.  I was 50/50 on whether Trish would turn or not.  4/5.<br />Rock'n'Sock Connection vs. Evolution-  Very good match especially for a tag/handicap match.  Foley looked good and Rock and Flair were hilarious.  4/5.<br />Playboy Evening Gown Match-  Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler vs. Jackie-  This was the terrible match.  Torrie used the O'Conoroll, no joke.  For Torrie's flying cross body and the hot Divas 1/5.<br />Cruiserweight Open with the 10 best WWE cruiserweights-  Action packed match.  A little rushed with the finishes but a lot of high-flying stuff.  4/5.<br />Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold Steve Austin as Guest Referee- Good but definitely not the best match.  They were stupid to stand around for 6 minutes(I timed it) staring at each allowing the fans to bash them.  Other than that it was fairly good.  3/5.<br />Fatal Four-Way WWE Tag Titles- Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi vs. APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Basham Brothers- Good but not as good as RAW's.  A little slower and shorter and some guys are less involved.  3/5.<br />Women's Championship- Victioria vs. Molly Holly- Good women's match but not as good as their Rumble one from HeAT.  2.5/5.<br />WWE Championship- Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle- Awesome technical match with plenty of action.  You've got to love the champ.  4.5/5.<br />Undertaker vs. Kane- Good return match for Taker.  Of course it's a little slower but it's the perfect length.  A classic Wrestlemania moment for the future with Taker's return.  3.5/5.<br />Triple-Threat World Heavyweight Championship Match- Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit- Great match especially for a triple-threat. Nonstop action.  One of the greatest Wrestlemania matches of all time.  5/5.<br />All in all, one of the most solid PPVs you'll see.  Easily in the top 5 Wrestlemanias, maybe in the top 2 or 3.  A pure masterpiece.  Really one for the collection.  Just watching this shows doubters why people love wrestling.
0440180295|3.0|The hero, or antihero, of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is Billy Pilgrim, a time traveling idiot savant.  The central event in Billy's life is the firebombing of Dresden, Germany, an event he witnesses with little emotion.  Billy has the sense to cry when he sees a pair of horses suffering but he is unnaturally passive in war, in his marriage, in raising his son, in being kidnapped and taken to the planet of Tralfamadore, and so on.  From his experiences on Tralfamadore, Billy comes to perceive time in a different way that is very comforting to him and perhaps to Vonnegut as well.<br />First published in 1969, Slaughterhouse-Five has an experimental feel to it.  Billy's time travel leads to some unconventional juxtaposition of scenes, and Vonnegut makes frequent use of asides to the reader to tell us about himself and why he wrote the book.  Tragic events are described in flat, emotionless terms.  <br />Slaughterhouse-Five is a quick and entertaining read, and it educates the reader about the horrors of bombing directed against civilians.  Because of the flat tone, though, and because the characters are so unattractive, there doesn't seem to be much of a message here except to say that men are fools.
B000148KK2|2.0|I know that musicians like to branch out, try different things. This is how they evolve and change. However this is certainly not Diana's best work. Let Elvis write his songs and sing his way and Diana you stick with what you are best at. I am glad this is not her first recording. The CD is not without its good points, but not what I really want when I buy a Dianna Krall CD.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Steph isn't mature enough to broaden her musical horizons and open her mind and ears to anything other than the cliche that is Nirvana and the twisted morals of Kurt Cobain. He repeatedly told interviewers that musicians who glorify drugs will go to hell. It happened to him, so I guess he was right. Kurt Cobain was a preachy little hypocrite. Nirvana is nothing to waste your time on. Despite what Steph thinks, Nirvana is very tame and traditional. I suggest New Wave and real Punk, so go for something meaningful and experimental like PIL or The B-52's. Ever notice how young Nirvana's fanbase always has been? Ever wonder why? Because we all grow up and end up getting a job and/or devoting our lives to something other than a guy like Kurt Cobain who wasn't man enough to accept our love and adoration. This Greatest Hits package is fine for the kids who like the band, but be forewarned-- you'll grow out of it the second you get a job, have a kid, deal with the death of a loved one, or have a term paper to do-- basically whenever life hits you smack in the face. Music (especially superficial music like Nirvana) doesn't matter when you have to live life day-to-day. But Nirvana fans can't understand any of that because they are surround by the protective bubble that is the homelife they say they hate but actually are terrified to lose.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a very solid, important and long due work deserving the best aknowledgement.  Yes, there are some shortcomings there but they are very minor compairing with the overall result.  I liked it considerably and I wish there was more of the same type of films.  What I really would like to see is something more international covering Russians, French, English, Polish and even the enemies as Germans, Italians, Turks and the Japanese.  I would love to see that.  And the Band of Brothers is quite satisfying already.  Thank you for keeping the memory of these heroes alive.
B000148KK2|4.0|I'm going to edit my original review and let you know that this CD is growing on me. I left the original text below so you can see my first impressions. After reading the other reviews, I went back and listened more carefully... some of the lyrics are still hard on my ears, but the music is beautiful. Her phrasing is spot-on and her musicianship is awesome.<br />If you disliked it, listen again. If you don't have it, give it an honest try... you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------<BR>After listening to this CD several times, I have to agree that there isn't a single cut that I like. The combination of great music, incredible arranging and a truly awesome mix can't overcome the awful lyrics. I can't agree with the Diana Krall Fan who said that we just want her to play the standards... that's BS.<br />Lose the bad poetry and make it an instrumental.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I am not a big fan of Diane Keaton, but I think she did a good job in this movie; Though I don't think she deserved the golden globe for best female performance. I disliked the plot of old guy dating young female. It was SO BORING!!! I also thought the scene where Diane Keaton was nude was uncalled for.     In spite of some predictable moments, however, this movie was good. The beginning storyline of old-guy/young-girl gets a twist as Diane Keatons character starts to date a young guy. There were some really funny moments in this movie! Jack Nicholson was his usual entertaining self.     When I watched the movie the first time my impression was different than after my second watching. I enjoyed the movie more the second time.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|My friends and I have seen Michael perform live at venues in the US, Canada and England. We are in the mid 30's - 40's age range and totally devoted.<BR>He is one of the most unique entertainers I have ever seen. His voice is simply golden, mellow, contagious. He can sing just about anything and have your attention. The DVD is representative of who he is, a charismatic, friendly, fun-loving guy who has a real heart. I find him totally 'refreshing'. There are some cuts on the DVD that simply don't showcase his vocals enough, but if you have seen him perform live and have listened to his self-entitled CD, the DVD is another dimension to his natural talent and showcases the insides of who he is as a person. His band is not only talented, but very obviously devoted to him and he likewise adores them and treats them with the utmost of respect and recognition. As far as I can see it, he will have a long lasting career just being who he is...a genuine, fun-loving guy with a voice that will go on forever. Keep up the good work, Michael.
B000001IPL|5.0|I'm by no means a big punk fan, but this album has just about everything a metal fan wants to appreciate punk.  I have always appreciated the Offspring for creating anthemic punk with great riffs and really catchy lyrics.  This album is really a standard of rock.  Songs like Self-Esteem, Bad Habit, Gotta Get Away, Smash &amp; Come Out And Play still hold up the same they did when it was released some 10 years ago.  This is an album anyone can listen to and love.  MANDATORY LISTENING!
B0001LJCPC|5.0|L'Arena and Il Mercenario are two differeny compositions. However they are from the same film also called Il Mercenario!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears is one of the few artists who can create such a huge buzz everytime she comes back out.  With \\"In The Zone\\", Britney shows us a diversity of tracks that also demonstrate how she has grown up and changed throughout the years.  The only dissapointment would be that there is no collaboration with the Neptunes.  However the collaboration with Madonna some what makes up for it. Here's the run-down:<br />1. Me Against The Music ft. Madonna (5/5)- The lead single shows an interesting collabo that gets you on your feet.<BR>2. Boom Boom ft. Ying Yang Twins (5/5)- A good dance track with a southern crunk beat.<BR>3. Showdown (3/5)- It's okay, I generally skip it.<BR>4. Breathe On Me (5/5)- Extremely sexy breathy vocals that make it a good listen<BR>5. Early Mornin' (4/5)- Her collaboration with Moby is pretty good, not a highlight but still good.<BR>6. Toxic (5/5)- THE BEST SONG HERE!! It makes you wanna dance until your feet fall off, very sexy song!<BR>7. Outrageous (4/5)- Not my favorite but R. Kelly makes it pretty good.<BR>8. Touch Of My Hand (5/5)- Well... Uhh... yeah.  Good song.<BR>9. The Hook Up (3/5)- Tried to do a reggae thing but I didn't enjoy it too much.<BR>10. Shadow (5/5)- Amazing ballad, good vocals<BR>11. Brave New Girl (3/5)- Tacky, not that great of a song<BR>12. Everytime (5/5)- Sad break up song and really good too.
B000003S5H|5.0|Thursday, April 29, 2004 found me at Paramount Theatre in Seattle to experience Air live.  It was a truly emotional experience to see the people who changed the way I thought about music.  It was nearly five years ago when I first heard &quot;Moon Safari.&quot;  Nearly five years later I still am listening to it on a regular basis.<br />With &quot;Moon Safari,&quot; Air has managed to produce an album that is modern with countless references to the past.  There are many references to Jazz and Rock, but they never overshadow the ultra mellow electronic aspect.  This album is perfect for anything from 'background socialization' music to 'do nothing but listen to music' music.<br />One listen will tell anyone why this (as of today) is ranked 441 on Amazon.com's sales list (out of severl hundred thousand).  Air's critical acclaim across many countries is evidence that they produce music that is something special to humankind.
0894803123|5.0|Only tried the Oreos and Cream recipe so far (we're supposed to be on a diet...) but it is WONDERFUL. And incredibly easy to make. Beats any custard-based ice-cream I've ever made or had. And if you are squeamish about using raw eggs, just use pasteurized eggs or egg substitutes and get over it!
B00008PX8P|1.0|Led Zeppelin is the second greatest band of all time, (better than everyone except The Beatles) but this DVD is awful. The performances ramble on for much longer than the studio recordings. I am a diehard Zep fan, but seeing Page play a guitar with a violin bow for more than ten minutes gets a little tedious, to say the least. Disc 1 is worthless. The only good song on it is &quot;Whole Lotta Love.&quot; Besides the one performance, the only other extras are of the band playing &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; THREE different times at THREE different locations. Disc 2 has the other three concerts, which are a little better. Although they do perform some of the best-loved Zep songs, these performances just don't capture the imagination or anything like that. Good thing I only rented it and didn't buy it.
B000001Y5X|3.0|I lisen 2 a lot a metal  and merilyn manson and this was not even close 2 his best!!!
0671027387|1.0|Great techno-thriller writers like Michael Crichton have the amazing ability to make a tale which is not even remotely plausible and make it seem extremely plausible.<br />Dan Brown clearly doesn't get that.<br />\\"Deception Point\\" is the biggest piece of garbage I've read in years. Aside from dropping every cliche known to man, giving characters names like dad soap operas (Sedgewick Sexton...pulleez) and getting stuck somewhere between a Lifetime Network movie and a James Bond film, the book is so badly conceived that when the real villain is finally unveiled, the reader has already figured it out to utter boredom 150 pages earlier.<br />This book will keep me from ever reading a Dan Brown novel again. If you want to avoid the same fate, pass this one by.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I enjoyed Reservoir Dogs, and was hoping this movie was of the same calibre.  Unfortunately, this movie was not nearly as clever, interesting, or rich in plot as Reservoir Dogs.  In fact, if you took out the gratuitous violence, and replaced the overdone and unrealistic fighting scenes with something that resembles a plot, it would still just barely qualify as a movie.
B000148KK2|1.0|I was a major fan of the silky and tender voice of Diana Krall... a talent who had the guts to take the sadly neglected \\"sensuous and classic\\" ballads of the 50s and 60s and give them a full orchestral treatment they deserve by master arranger Claus Ogerman. Her perfect vocal phrasing and piano bridges were simply magnificent and in the process she sold countless CDs of \\"The Look of Love\\", \\"Live in Paris\\" and \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" to romance-starved fans the world over. It was so refreshing to hear an artist who could take these masterpieces of music and interpret them so genuinely and so romanticly.<br />So now we have her anxiously awaited new album... \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" which many of her fans thought would continue the soft romantic sounds of \\"The Look of Love\\" and and instead, we are given pedestrian \\"b-side\\" songs, mainly written by her new husband Elvis Costello, a man who is known to be occasionally innovative, but clearly a pop musician with little charm, zero romance and who's simple songs show little emotional content. <br />On this outing Diana veinly attempts to sing in a style that would be far better suited to the fine vocalizations of Norah Jones, Sarah McLachlan, Stevie Nicks, Bonnie Raitt or Rickie Lee Jones... all of whom excell at this rural-pop style... Diana does not. Whats worse is that  the original Costello/Krall collaborations seem amateur ... the melodies go nowhere and the lyrics seem to ramble. The performance by Diana herself is detached and dry... perhaps because she is trying to emulate a female vocal sound that is in vogue at the moment.  There is nothing vivacious, romantic, innovative or particularly moving on this CD and it is clear Diana is aiming at the larger, but less demanding pop audience with this effort... but this album is not even good pop music, its sad, dripping with melancoly and lamenting and dull, unlike the women I mentioned above.  Diana is a huge talent, and she gave us some premium quality performancesthe last few albums and if this album is a big seller, it is because so many of us expected this album to be exceptional... it clearly is not.... it is quite pedestrian and not up to what Diana has the talent to create.
B000002UAX|2.0|Don't put this in your cd player while driving. you spend more time hitting the skip button than listening to the few good songs.
B0000009RX|1.0|What are you people listening too,there is not one redeeming song on this disc and I love ZAPPA.This does not come close to Overnite Sensation,One Size Fits All and APOSTROPHE just too mention a few.Spend your money eleswhere.
B0001Z53CY|1.0|Damn this album is a huge let down. Songs range from mediocre to plain wack. This is not a good album
B000148KK2|5.0|This goes out to all of those (self-proclaimed) jazz-enthusiasts that have been putting this recording down in reviews here on Amazon.com.  You have no idea what Jazz is and if your looking for freshly vomitted-up regurgitations that are pretty and well-produced fodder for the recording industry to pacify you who lack the curiousity or fortitude to challenge yourselves to remain open to something new and fresh then don't bother me and thousands of others by placing your closed-minded drivel you try to pass off as a review.  This record is a daring leap for Dianna Krall...kudos, Mrs. Krall-Costello...thank you for taking a chance...I was under the impression that taking chances and exploration was what was at the very core of Jazz...
B0001LJCPC|5.0|it's an instrumental loop of a RZA/Wu Tang track, the normal version of which is on the soundtrack. (it's the last song, it's listed on the inside of the tray sleeve. It's not worth it though, RZA is an idiot and rap should not have anything to do with Tarantino.<br />if you're talking about either of the two other songs played during the half-hour of credits, they're both on the soundtrack too.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is night.  Listen to it in the middle of the day, and if you look out the window you will be surprised to see that it is not dark out.  It exudes a sense of after-hours, when the sun has set and the day's work is over.  That being said, does that mean that this CD is boring?  Not at all.  Night, yes, but this night is one that crackles with energy.  It is night in the big city-- dark, but gloriously alive.  It is cool, and yet--somehow-- fiery.  It is blue, but vigorously so.  Finally, it is perfect... or nearly as perfect as music made by humans can be.

B0001ZX0PG|4.0|This is one flick that I am happy I saw. Although the story did seem to jump from one thing to another, everything else about the movie seemed fine. The acting was very good in this movie, esspecially Tim Robbins character. I hope that this DVD comes out soon so that I can watch again and maybe I'll understand the story a little bit better.
B000000WHX|5.0|Massive Attack -Blue Lines. I first heard this album about 2 months after it was released in 1991 when my sister bought a copy. I sat down and listened to the album from start to finnish, i loved it. No, i mean I LOVED IT! I knew from that moment that i was listening to a ground breaking album.<br />To produce a volume of work of this quality and vision in 1991 was incredible when you consider some of the tosh that was floating around then. For it still to be great, fresh at every listen over a decade on, tells its own story. I still listen to this album at least once a week, i enjoy new music and have some other classics that rate up there, but this album makes me shiver with delight. It's a classic...end of story. Anyone who cannot see this may as well go grab a muti pack, discount bundle of Britney Spears &amp; Robbie Williams albums and catch a first class ticket to musical hell.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Have never read one single Daredevil comic book in my life I guess my review is kind of unbiased. Okay, I am certainly NOT a fan of Ben Affleck but his presence in this film was an indifferent one rather than an aggravating one.<br />For those of you who are unfamiliar Daredevil is also known as Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer. But though his eyes do not work his other 4 sense do to a superhuman degree. Sounds, smells, touches and tastes go together to form a bizarre sight that has pros and cons over normal vision. It's pretty cool concept and it's reasonably well done.<br />But Daredevil has NO plot! It's a swift 90 minutes of practically nothing. The most involving part of the film is the romance between Affleck and Garner but it's cut short with the arrival of Colin Farrell who plays Bullseye, a paper-thin but funny character. Many have been annoyed at the fact that the Kingpin is played by a Black-American actor. But what does THAT matter? Who cares if he's white in the comic book? Michael Clarke Duncan brings some formidable integrity to the role but does come off as a bit too cuddly at the same time.<br />A tiny bit of story is set up but it's over very soon. I guess the best you could say is that Daredevil doesn't outstay its welcome. But you'll not remember it 5 minutes after seeing it. And I don't like the fact they chose to separate all Daredevil and Spiderman links just because they were licensed to different studios.<br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a very powerful DTS 5.1 track. Plus a bunch of extras I don't care about.
B000089RVX|5.0|I think it's ridiculous all the criticism Evanescence is undergoing.  People ridicule Evanescence for supposedly having &quot;no talent.&quot;  No talent?!  Evanescence is one of the first truly talented new rock bands I've seen in a while.  Amy Lee (Evanescence's Lead Vocalist) has the most beautiful, powerful, and unique voice I've ever heard, it can touch your heart and maybe even bring tears to your eyes.  Yet there are so many other so-called &quot;musicians&quot; out there with absolutely no talent that they don't even deserve to be labeled a musician.  So why bash Evanescence?<br />Then there are the ones who say &quot;Who wants to listen to depressed Goth crap?&quot;  So what if gothic, depressed music isn't your thing?  The majority of rockaholics ARE depressed, and they turn to music for comfort.  So leave Evanescence alone and save your criticism for someone truly non-talented.<br />Fallen is a great CD, so just because you're sick of hearing &quot;My Immortal&quot; or &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; (which are both great songs) doesn't mean you shouldn't give the rest of their album a chance.  So don't let the &quot;Evanescence-bashing&quot; reviews shape your view of Evanescence before you get a chance to actually check them out.
B00005V0X5|2.0|This is a band that says it has talent simply because it can make a lot of noise. A monkey can learn to pull strings on a piece of plastic, or hit cans with two sticks. This band just throws together the same old vocals with a little different variation everytime. <br />Just because they have been playing for a long time does not make them good. Emotion is where true talent lies, this band is just a shadow consisting of men who cant do anything beyond their pathedic band so they capitalize on people who liked their previous work. They have no emotion and are poor because of it. <br />I would give them one star, but there is one nice riff on the album, nothing special but its a nice ten seconds compared to the rest of the cd.
B000002I53|3.0|If you only own 20 jazz albums you probably feel that you have covered the many bases of this music. But just listen to Coltrane's Impulse, or Prestige recordings!! It's as though John's Atlantic material was the precursor to his greatest work- Love Supreme, Crescent, w/ Duke .E, all on Impulse. His work with Miles for Colombia Records isn't too bad either! This record is OK, more for the romantic listener than the seasoned jazz collector. As another reviewer said, it's an easy introduction to jazz music; enough said.  cheers- jb
B000089RVX|5.0|It astounds me that there is so much confrontation over Evanescence's ability to compose music.  I believe they are a great band, if you're into gothic hard rock.<br />I bought their CD before nominations and extreme popularity, and I loved it. Even if I hadn't bought it until now, I would still buy their album reguardless of awards or popularity, and would ignore any criticism towards Evanescence.
B00005A46T|5.0|I can't understand why people hate this band. This cd blends together everything I love about music. Some is brutal and hard, some is soft and sick, an the rest is a perfect balance between the two. Not seince Emperor have I seen such detail and quality given to every song.<br />All of this and it has raw, emotional lyrics that eclipse even the hardest riffs. This cd is simply one of the best ever made.
B00005A46T|4.0|With this Cd it seems you love it or hate it. The truth is that alot of the people who hate it just don't like nu-metal. So I ask the question, why the hell did you buy it then?! I don't listen to country because I know I will hate it and be compeled to write a reveiew bashing on it (that happened to me with rap, just read my reveiw of the black album from jay-z). For the CD itself...it is a good, CD probably 9 or 10 good songs, but it has its problems. First off slipknot tries to make up for lyrics with cussing. That isn't a horrible thing but it gets annoying after awhile. Plus they try way to hard to be satanic, and when they have satanic lyrics it sounds like it was written by a drunk ten year old who was mad at God. So aside from the lyrics this CD is great, but the lyrics are so dumb i had to take off 1 1/2 stars. Oh yeah, if your'e looking for a CD that you can listen to when your'e angry this is perfect. People=sxxt is my favorite angry song.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I loved Tarantino movies like &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; so I paid 20 bucks for the DVD thinking this movie would be great too.  WRONG!!  This movie is so bad that I had to turn it off after about 45 minutes.  Probably only the 3rd or 4th time I've had to do that in my life, so that's pretty bad.  It is very slow-moving and boring, and it constantly strays away from the point.  You have to sit through about 15 minutes of cartoon-fighting which I thought was retarded.  If I wanted to watch cartoons I'd borrow my nephew's DVDs.  There wasn't nearly as much fighting or violence as in his other movies (at least in the first half) but of what violence it did have sucked.  And the parts where he tried to make it funny were not at all funny.  They were stupid.  I can't believe this movie sucked so bad!  What a huge disppointment.  Don't waste your money - it sucks!

B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I just bought Thirteenth Step, having only heard about four songs from the CD.  I was impressed by the amazing almost gothic lyrics and subtle melodies.  <BR>My favorite tracks are The Noose, Blue, A Stranger, The Outsider, The Nurse Who Loved Me, Pet, and Gravity.<BR>If you like bands like Incubus and Soundgarden, you'll love APC.
B00000JCOV|4.0|This cd is very hard and raw. It combines the most brutal music in america to this point and takes it to another level. <br />But unlike talentless repedative bands like metalica and megadeth, Slipknot actualy have something to say. Even with their hard sound they keep lyrics that are very in-depth and emotional. No other band has been able to blend poetry, emotion and a hard unique sound into one cd as slipknot have.<br />I would give this five stars, but the only thing I did not like was the Purity wasn't included here. Not to say I dont love the rest of the cd, but that song would have made it even better.
B00000JBCP|5.0|Man is one of my favorite bands, and this is by far their best CD. If you are buying this, I would also suggest MTV Unplugged by Shakira (also incredible) and by 10,000 Maniacs.
B000148KK2|1.0|I can't review the music on this cd because I CAN'T play this cd on anything I own! Am I the only one who is having this problem? This cd will not play on my computer, my car system OR my home system. Well, a few songs played on my home system before it screwed up and wouldn't play at all. Out of 600 plus cd's that I own this is the ONLY one I have ever had that will not play. And this is my SECOND copy! I noticed on the fine print on the cd that the record company is now stating that they are not responsible for any damage this cd may cause. I've never noticed that warning before. What's going on here? Anti-piracy crap on the cd now to make it unplayable? This cd is &quot;enhanced&quot;, to use that word very loosely. The only enhancement on it, and the only part that played on my pc was a link to her website. That's it! I don't know, but I would be very careful about buying this cd. I will now return this, for the second time, this time for a refund. I am not a happy camper.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW. if you're into singers like John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Josh Kelley, and Jason Mraz, etc... you will love this CD and Gavin DeGraw will quickly become your favorite of the &quot;group.&quot; Gavin has a raw, edgy, feel to his beats and voice which makes him stand out among other artists &quot;like him.&quot; you know how on most CDs these days there are only a few good songs, and you end up skipping over the CD to listen to those same five songs? not with Gavin's CD. every song on his CD is single material, and I love every one. you can listen to this CD all of the way through without wanting to skip a song (that is rare these days). you can tell he put time, thought, and talent into this work. I love how Gavin's personality comes out through each song. and every song's truly different, you can go from the soft, sweet, melodic &quot;Follow Through&quot; to an edgier &quot;Chemical Party&quot; and &quot;I Don't Wanna Be&quot; to a soulful song like &quot;Belief&quot; to a feel good song like &quot;Crush.&quot; THIS ALBUM IS GOLD. pick it up today. you won't be disappointed.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I have been a fan for a while now. I recently met Gavin and he is one of the nicest people EVER! His music is amazing and he is an awsome live performer. Best CD You could ever buy.
B00006G8G1|5.0|This show just goes off!!!!<BR>And opening with &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; rocks!!! Such a good song, my band's learning it now to cover it!!! <br />There's a lot of &quot;Brave New World&quot; tracks on here, and although it's cool when bands play more oldschool stuff, I like these songs! I haven't heard the whole album, just the live ones but it sounds like it must be a good one.<br />The DTS mix is unreal!! It's so loud and clear, I haven't even tried the Dolby 5.1 mix!! &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; makes my sub want to explode so that's cool hahaha<br />Watching Bruce use the stage is really good to see, he's a champ!! I hear he's a little uptight in person but I don't give a damn!!! Nicko's always cool to watch, even though the audiance must have barely seen him behind his huge cage of percussion! It's funny when he starts dancing behind the kit on &quot;The Clansman.&quot;<br />Highlight songs to me are probably: The Wicker Man, The Trooper, Sign of the Cross, Dream of Mirrors, good ol' Hallowed, and I don't know...the rest of the show!<br />The only thing I didn't like about this DVD was the damn price!! Everywhere I see it it's about $AUS 50 - 60!! Too much man, too much. But damn it those Maiden boys are good!! I wish they'd bring their damn &quot;Dance of Death&quot; tour down under!! When the hell were they last here??? Oh well, I'll just have to keep watching &quot;Rock In Rio&quot; until they do!

B00000AFDW|1.0|This is the rockin' equivelent to the lame pop unmasked. the only good song is psycho circus and who knows who the heck is playing on it because Kiss can never be honest to their local sucker fans like me. For years i thought sweet pain was one of ace's best solos and it turned out that it was dick wagner of alice cooper fame.<br />This album doesn't have any melodic highs points whatsoever.<br />It's pathetic lame pop goo like \\"We are one' which sounds like a Barney song.<br />Then there's into the void which is dead on arrival ace spew.<br />This album is just a big piece of crap.<br />Kiss has lost their guts and passion for music making due to their sick greed.<br />Hey gene, why don't you let Ace put some of his real rockin' tunes on an album???<br />Maybe you're just scared that he'll destroy you like he detroyed the band with his monster 1978 solo album<br />Ace is the man.<br />This album is just a sad pile of puke.<br />Hey Paul,go call Bob Ezrin and listen to Destroyer so you can remember how it used to be when you loved rock n' roll instead of using rock n' roll just as a tool to make you some more dough!<br />This album stinks like a pile of goat turd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0790729628|5.0|For everyone who says that they don't know what's going on in this fantastic scifi classic, you must also read the book that inspired the movie--I'm sure it's available here at Amazon.  It's titled:\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"  by Phillip K. Dick.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is an amazing book. It's about the life of a boy named Jonas and the society in which he lives. Jonas lives in a world where they choose sameness over risk. Everyone has the same amount of people in their family. Everyone can only see black and white. Everyone follows rules exactly. No one can hear music. No one has individual birthdays, instead everyone is born in the same year and all become \\"ones\\" together, then \\"twos\\" together, then \\"threes\\". There is a ceremony for each year. At the ceremony for \\"nines,\\" everyone receives the same birthday gift, a bicycle. This society does not know real death, does not know pain and does not know love. Everyone thinks the same and acts the same. They choose sameness over individuality because there are no risks. No one can get hurt. There are no problems.<BR>At the ceremony of \\"12's,\\" the kids get assigned jobs. Jonas is assigned to be the Receiver, a very honored job, but does not know what the Receiver does. As Jonas trained with the elderly Receiver, he learned that the receiver held all the people's memories of when there was pain, suffering, death and war.  The Receiver also held all the memories of real love, true happiness and individuality. As the Receiver, Jonas learned of these emotions, as well as learned the existence of color and music. The Receiver kept all the memories away from the society to protect the people from suffering, but for years the Receiver had been trying to think of someway to allow society to share the memories, so the society could learn real pain and true love and get rid of sameness. <BR>Once Jonas started his training, the Receiver became the Giver and Jonas became the Receiver. Together they came up with a plan for Jonas to run away to the true world which existed outside the boundaries of the community and as he ran the memories would be released into the community and sameness would be lost forever. <BR>What is so interesting is that this story could take place in the past, present or future. Perhaps our society evolved from Jonas' society, from sameness to individuality. On the other hand, Jonas' society could exist in the present, existing as we speak. Or this society could take place in the future and we are the people from which the society of sameness evolved into individuality.<BR>I recommend this book to teens and adults. Both age groups can relate to the story and reflect deeply about life, the way we choose to live and the experiences, both good and bad, that we share. This book makes you think about what a society without pain, color, suffering, love or joy would be like would be like. Would you rather choose sameness with no risks, or a world where you can be yourself, take chances, a life with risk where people are hurt and hated, but where there is color, happiness, music and true love?<BR>You decide!
B00005JMSE|5.0|When I first heard about HELLBOY, I wasn't very impressed and had no intentions of seeing the movie. Then I saw some of the previews and my interest was piqued. After talking with some friends who had seen the film, I decided I really wanted to see this movie. I was not disappointed.<br />HELLBOY begins in 1944 Scotland. Hitler has been organizing a paranormal team for sometime, led by the infamous Russian Zarist advisor, Rasputin. President Roosevelt has dispatched a team to stop the evil scum before they release the dark powers from another realm. The Americans succeed in thwarting the Nazis' plan and Rasputin is sucked into the nether regions. However, before the victory, something from the great beyond came through the portal. That something turns out to be a little red demon with a huge stone fist. The Americans are entranced by the creature and name him Hellboy. Hellboy is adopted and raised by Professor Trevor Bloom (John Hurt) and the two become prominent, but hidden members of the secret paranormal branch of the FBI. Years later Rasputin is resurrected and it's up to Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Professor Bloom, Agent John Myers, and their staff to rid the world of the Rasputin menance.<br />Ron Perlman portrays Hellboy and he's embodies the character just as good, if not better than Tobey Maguire as Spiderman or Christopher Reeves as Superman. I don't think there is any other actor alive who could have captured the nuances of Hellboy so well. Heck, I'll go so far as to say that if Hollywood ever really seriously considered acting nominations for action/sci-fi pictures (they should consider all films, but they don't), Perlman would have one in the bag. The other supporting actors do a good job, too, but besides Perlman I especially enjoyed the performance of John Hurt, he's one of the most underrated character actors of our time.<br />The action in HELLBOY is typical of a comic book flick and some might hold that against the movie. Still, it is a comic book flick and for that, it's pretty good stuff. There is some fairly witty and original dialogue in the script and the direction of Guillermo del Toro holds everything in place. There are a few words of foul language here and there, but nothing that is out of place.<br />In fact, my only complaint about the film is that the villans are completely underdeveloped.  Most of the good guys have some sort of character development during the screen time (though Abe Sapien doesn't get a whole lot). However, the bad guys; and especially Rasputin, don't get any development at all. This is a little disappointing because Rasputin is such an interesting character and the film could have been even better with just a little more character development upon him. Other than that, though, HELLBOY is one rip-roaring good time.book flick and for that, it's pretty good stuff.

B000021YQV|2.0|Like all nu metal, this album is weak and stupid. The lyrics are dumb, and the stupid singer is yellin' like some sort of a maniac. There are a couple of okay songs that save this from being a one star album, but a word of warning to metal newbies: this is not real metal. Go get some good old school metal instead, like Iron Maiden or Ozzy Osbourne.
B00005ATZT|5.0|This is one of the best-crafted action/suspense films I've ever seen.  I've viewed this many many times and have been rewarded each time by picking up on different subtle nuances.<br />Every element of this film works in unison and are what make this a great film and give it the punch that it has.  There's the story which is as finely crafted as they get, a cast that couldn't have been any better (and boy do the actors deliver in their performances), tight pacing, great photography, and some unbelievable effects.<br />This is a modern masterpiece!
B0000085N4|5.0|Hard rock at its fullest. While in the band's earlier years, they had sounded more post-punk, on 1989's Sonic Temple (as the title and cover suggest), the band turns into a full-fledged heavy metal band. The songs are well written and well played. Ian Astbury is a singer that can very well entertain you. The guitars are energetic, and have a sound that can make you want to bang your head. Some of the Cult's finest material is on here like Sun King, Fire Woman, and Edie. Some less heard of songs on here that are just as good are American Horse and New York City. Go buy this.
B000035Z3K|5.0|This a cool movie about a vampire who sucks peoples blood and kills them. There's a old guy named Van Helsing who tries to kill Dracula. I think everyone has seen this, which is good, beacuse it's a great film. You should go but it.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|This band figures among the recent wave of heavy metal bands who make music like old metal. Although this is not exactly metal, it could be called hard rock. It is pretty much garage-rock with heavy AC/DC influences. It would be a 5-star album, but I think there are too many ballads. They should have just kept it with Look What Youv'e Done and Move On. However, the heavier songs whack you like a ten-pound wallop. You may have heard Are You Gonna Be My Girl on the radio, because it's a big hit. The best songs on the album are Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Lazy Gun, and Cold Hard [B****].
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The original \\"Matrix\\" effectively combined stylistic action with philosophy and spirituality, and although it resorted to action-film formula more than a few times, it remains an impressive effort. Naturally, expectations were high for the two sequels, filmed simultaneously at large expense. Would the first sequel, \\"Matrix Reloaded,\\" expound upon the impressive premise established in the first film? <br />To be blunt: I can see why the word \\"load\\" is in the title.  <br />This murky, confusing sequel undermines nearly everything established in the first film. Gone are the subtle references to Zen Buddhism and Gnostic Christianity that gave the series broad appeal. Instead, we're treated to vague euphemisms for--and references to--free will and choice. The Wachowskis abandoned the more philosophical bent of the original in favor of more action, and that ends up making this film nearly unwatchable. The non-action segments are stupefyingly dull, featuring wretched dialogue that is uncomfortably similar to the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels, and inane plot development that is merely a sideshow to all the action. Some parts are truly bad: The \\"rave orgy\\" near the beginning of the movie may be the worst segment in any of the three films, accompanied by perhaps the most unsexy sex scene in recent memory. There's no passion in Neo and Trinity's lovemaking, and the same could be said for the Wachowski's script and direction: Apart from the action segments the movie slows to an utter, stultifying crawl. It's a labor to watch. The one exception is when Neo meets the Architect, and discovers what may be some unsettling truths about the Matrix and the nature of reality. There's more plot development and intrigue packed into the Architect's few minutes of dialogue than in the rest of the film combined.<br />Not that all of the film was bad, however. While the film fails to deliver the goods where plot, dialogue, and characterization are concerned, it does offer some excellent action sequences. Three in particular stand out: Neo vs. the Merovingian's men, the dynamic highway chase, and Neo vs. multiple (and I do mean MULTIPLE) Agent Smiths in what has become known as \\"the Burly Brawl.\\" The highway chase is an exciting twelve minute set piece full of dizzying action and unbelievable stunts and effects, all delivered in a nearly flawless manner. The \\"burly brawl,\\" perhaps the best-know segment from Reloaded, is sensational, with Neo duking it out in dynamic fashion with the rogue Smith and his innumerable duplicates. The famous \\"wire-fu\\" effects are used to great results here; Neo and Smith defy gravity and physical laws in an impressive battle. But those scenes are merely small punctuations in the overall dullness of this film. Ultimately, \\"Reloaded\\" is done in by its own pretentiousness and total lack of subtext. Fortunately, the third film would bring some of the energy and subtle mysticism back to the series. But it cannot make up for the gargantuan misstep that \\"Reloaded\\" comprises.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Ah! Just listen to the pure rock fury pounded upon your ears in every living second of this heavy metal classic. This truly sums up metal in every sense of the word: screaming, deafening guitars, pounding drums, and thick, heavy bass. While some people might say Van Halen is just a classic rock band, they are very wrong. They might have gone a little light later on, but this is definitely no Steve Miller cd. I just can't believe how heavy this is. Itwas probably one of the heaviest albums around at the time of its 1978 release. Only Judas Priest was heavier. So go buy it. Your ears will thank you.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|The facts derivated from the story put us before a man who wants to get away his destiny , but (in a mgnificent shakesperian mood), nobody can escape from his past.<br />There is no doubt that this film has multiple virtues. Sean Penn grew up like actor al least two thousands steps. His role is so well made like the sinister lawyer without a drop of scruples, and this is the fate's arm that literally takes to Carlitos Brigante and throws to hell.<br />In my personal view, I think Sean Penn deserved an Academy award by this role.<br />It is a sinister view about the redemption given by Montana since he leaves the jail.<br />Pacino gives one of his more relevant roles all along his career.<br />He gives us that crude sensation of walking in the edge of the knife through all the film. Will it be necessary to say that in this film like in others, Pacino is much more than an actor, he is a force of the nature and elevates the standard performance of every one of his partners?.<br />Watch for instance one of my favorite beauties of the cinema: Penelope Ann Miller.<br />There are several unforgettable sequences in the film. The first of these belongs to that claustrophobic situation in which we find Carlitos, when he decides to rescue the money of his beloved friend. In his honor code, Carlitos can not give a \\"no\\" like answer. And that is the road to his perdition.<br />The other anthology scene is that made in the hospital when he visits to the lawyer by last time. The slow camera describes all the movements of the false police who revenges to his father and we can see how the bullets are released by Carlitos just before.<br />The final shots camera in the chase when he has planned everything and runs with the clock dictating its final minutes. The angles of camera and the tension produced in the train station for me is above his tribute to Potemkin in \\"The untouchables\\".<br />Carlitos way is a cult movie. But also you can consider like the shakespearian spirit made present in what I would design  together with Road to Perdition , the most original \\"film noir\\" movies in the last fifteen years.ith Road to Perdition , the most original \\"film noir\\" movies in the last fifteen years.
B000002JS6|4.0|This is supposed to be one of the greatest metal albums ever, and they are half right. Although I don't think this is the best album ever, it does have a certain sound that draws you into the metal. Side One is better than side two. Side One features Hell's Bells, Shoot To Thrill and more. Side Two, while featuring You Shook Me and Back In Black, is slightly weaker than the previous side. A cool album by any standards. go and buy it. But a word of warning: this is a little bit overrated, so don't expect anything like Number Of The Beast on here.
B00005QAPH|5.0|You'll find this movie a real tour de force with a script that doesn't seem get old, but becomes so fresh forty one years after being filmed. The presence of this mytical actor like Mastroinanni, giving one of his three best performances in his carrer. The charisma and beuuty of Claudia Cardinale (The italian image of Anna Karina), and the absolutely irreverent script supported by a cinematic progress in the narrative, the surrealistic elipsis that engage us with the different stages in the life of our undecided and troubled director. His dreams, fantasies of his childhood and youth, are described with elegant insolence.<br />Together with Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, Fellini makes a couple of directors who told all what they wanted without restrictions , with absolute liberty.<br />Amarcord in my opinion is Fellini's masterpiece, but it's just to recognize that cinematographily is less border edge than 8 1/2.<br />If you really want to have a real treasure cinematheque, don't think it over.<br />Buy this , because this film owns the landmark of the inmortality.<br />One of the best one hundred films of any age.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I agree that it was an ok season....and since I want the entire series I must buy Season 5, but my gosh..... why pay so much for so less??????
B0000YEEHG|5.0|The first five minutes talks about the genesis of the film (fracture, demolition)like a dream into another, one but also deals with the chaotic beginning until reaches its own balance with the blurried images of a woman in the lense.<br /><br />Bergman begins the film with a shocking image, that constitutes one of the keys to make us drown in this bergmanian ocean.<br /><br />Persona is the film in which Liv Ullman makes his actoral debut. And what kind of performance! .<br /><br />In her role of nurse, Bibi Anderson tries to get some rapport with Elizabeth Vogler (Liv Ulman)  who is literally shocked by a awful TV scene, previous to her characterization as Elektra.<br /><br />Andrei Tarkovski, considered this film the best of Bergman. Somehow, the opening scene of \\"The mirror\\" , Tarkovski pays a sincere homagge to Bergman. Watch it and link with Persona.<br /><br />Returning with Persona, the film is the reconstruction of a disordered puzzle of hidden emotions and feelings of the opera singer. The deep admiration of the nurse by this artist, engages her in a commitment that goes beyond her mission.<br /><br />You can watch how slowly this troubled soul shows before us with all its ugliness .<br /><br />The speches are so well written that will leave you open-mouthed, photography and ilumination are the third actor, and the camera work is apealling and fluid.<br /><br />But when you arrive to the peak of the film and admire that melt of images, you'll check once more why Bergman (1918) is one of the supreme filmmakers of the Cinema History.
0316548189|5.0|I was impressed by the author's struggle against apartheid, but I was more impressed by his struggle to rise above hatred.  His vision for the future of South Africa included freeing the South African people of color from opression and freeing the white South Africans from fear.  Paraphrasing Bishop Tutu: Nelson Mandela is perhaps the icon of forgiveness.  His generosity of spirit was inspiring and the history was fascinating.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|To say it in few words: Patton is the most genuine state of epic spirit you feel since the first shots. The supeb visual impact you receive when Patton gives his speech with the american flag behind him still remain in our memory.<br /><br />What can we add underlying the superb performing of George C. Scott? . More than an actor, Scott was a model. You feel Patton and forget half an hour after to Scott, because he melts with the character and disappears before us, in a mesmerizing way that you could compare without any effort to Marlon Brando.<br />Franklin Schaffner was a talented director. Imagine the caleidoscopic twist that means going from The planet of the apes to Patton and ending with Nicholas and Alexandra.<br /><br />The camera' s handling , the brilliant sequences of the desert{s battle, the insights of the General are described and supported by a genial script.<br /><br />There's a worthy point which deserves to mention: the reflections of Patton when he's in the battlefield remembering that somehow he was there, reminding the echoes of the Greeks who fought centuries ago. It's a powerful metaphor but told with such kind of force that you remind to Alejandro Magno and Achilles with making use of the emotive memories.<br /><br />What has it happened then after this movie?<br /><br />Patton is an emblematic personality the hero' s essence encarnated in the middle of the XX Century.<br /><br />The epic sense reachs his goals through the great triumphs, the innovative strategies, that only you can establish another brilliant soldier who was Mc Arthur in the other side of the world.<br /><br />I' m sure that Moshe Dayan understood the essence of this General since his student days. I haven't seen any interview in this sense but somehow in my mind and in my spirit tells me that I'm right.
B000148KK2|3.0|Let me preface my comment by saying I've been a fan of Diana Krall since &quot;All For You,&quot; and I despised the appeal to popularism that was &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes.&quot;  Oh, those schlocky 1001 strings!!!  And don't even ask me about &quot;The Look of Love.&quot;  With that in mind, it is not surprising that for a new Diana Krall album I would *love* to hear a return to her jazz-trio roots.  <br />Regarding this new album, the other commentators are correct when they say it is not a return to the swinging standards I enjoy so much.  And for that I am disappointed.  However, I must admit I find this new album much more musically honest, deep, complex and challenging than &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love.&quot;  It's not what I was hoping for, but it's interesting nonetheless.

B00006RU5B|3.0|... somehow, it's lacking.<br />  Let me start by stating i loved Soundgarden, and i regard Chris Cornell as one of the best r'n'r voices of all time. I never liked RATM as much, through i could certainly appreciate their music.<BR>  So, you have these amazing talents releasing a rock album... i was eager in expectance. I first heard &quot;Cochise&quot; on the radio; i thought it sounded great, very professional, but for some reason, it didn't hook me. Then, after a while &quot;Show me how to live&quot; started rotating and i *HAD* to buy the album. It was a round, excellent song. Amazing rocker, try driving to it: you will need to step on the gas!<br />  The thing is, it happens with all of the album. On one hand, you have tracks as the mentioned &quot;Show me how to live&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the sun&quot;, &quot;Light my way&quot;, &quot;Set it off&quot;, and a few others, and then there's the rest, which is NOT bad, but doesn't feel right. It has no spark to it. When it's good, it soars; when it's not, it becomes bleak, even boring. The vocals are excellent, the musicanship and production are top notch, but it's only &quot;fresh&quot; in doses. <BR>  It should have been expected anyway; it's a new band and a debut album, no matter the credentials of the members. Be positive that they will no doubt improve a lot with time, as the band &quot;loosens up&quot;. I'm dying to hear what they have coming out on their second album.<br />  Still, i like it. I like it more than most of the stuff that came out on 2002. Just don't approach it with uber-high expectatives, and certainly not expecting RATM nor Soundgardens' new album. There is some damn fine music here.

Then I have some good news for you, if you havent already discovered this?<br />If you go to the special features, go down and highlight the GAG REEL, then press right -&gt; and you should have highlighted the gremlins hands...push OK and you can veiw the scene from the video version where the gremlins take over the movie, and go into the John Wayne film ..ect, instead of the bit where Hulk Hogan tells the gremlins off! So those of you who where disapointed that wasnt included....well, it is! and thats how to find it!!!!
B000059XY5|4.0|Let's face it, once Michael Keaton and Tim Burton parted the Batman films were horrible. Keaton may not have made the best superhero but he was better than Val Kilmer and George Clooney who both struggled to fill Keaton's shoes.  Batman Returns is a very entertaining sequel. I bought the drinking cups, the poster, everything. It was a major event back in 1992. It is one film that will be around and one no one should miss whether they are a fan of Batman or not.

B000148KK2|5.0|After the very disappointing &quot;The Look of Love&quot; Diana is back with a good studio effort. I'm not surprised this record disappoints some people, as they would prefer to hear her sing some standards again. The truth is this could be her best record so far, the songs are intimate and very creative. Her choices of cover songs are more contemporary and less commercial however they are wonderfully played and sung and not as syrupy as her last effort. Her cover of Elvis's classic Almost Blue (once covered by Chet Baker) is beautiful and complements their original compositions.<BR>Elvis Costello's lyrics were inspired by Diana's direction however surprisingly they are dark not that it should be unexpected as typically Elvis writes melancholy lyrics. Also with the recent passing of Diana's Mother some songs reflect that loss. I thought however their recent found love for each other would be more evident on their co-written songs.<BR>This is a great new direction for Diana and a positive step forward for Jazz. Jazz can not continue to simply repeat standards and keep it self a stagnate art of another time. Perhaps the jazz purist will be disappointed but more important this might turn a new generation on to the Jazz of their time and the classics of tomorrow.
0312995423|1.0|If you make it to the end, you'll understand my title. During the \\"crisis\\" at the end, this was all I could think of yet, for some reason, the characters wouldn't do it. Brown evidently forgot that to write a good book, some research into your subject is necessary and that the plot lines have to be some what plausible.<br />NSA computers connected to the internet. Lame computer-ese. Shallow characters. Ridiculous plot twists. A puzzle at the end a 7 year old could solve. This book has 'em all. If this book were made into a movie, the'd show the actors typing on computer keyboards that make teletype noises and monitors that show the characters they type so large, there are only a few lines of text on the screen.<br />Avoid this book like a virus. I wish I had. In fact, I think Dan Brown, the author, owes me a couple of hours of my life back. The only good thing it didn't cost me any money. I borrowed it from the library.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|The ending of the movie was wonderful, but I would have enjoyed this movie much more if it hadn't been so sexed up. The sex aspect did not contribute one tiny bit to the \\"love\\" focus of the movie, in fact, it highly distracted from it and cheapend it. Get real movie makers...start making movies we want to feel. The old standby that \\"sex sells\\" is getting old. This movie is just littered in bad taste.
0553381709|5.0|Let me start by saying that i consider the Song of Ice and Fire series to be the finest fantasy ive ever had the pleasure of reading. While i understand the complaints made by previous readers of its graphical and vulgar nature far from being repulsed by Martins style of writing i consider it to be one of his greatest strengths. I remember being blown away by A Game of Thrones simply because the characters acted and spoke like real people and sitting slack jawed when Ned Stark was executed(What!!???! a major good guy actually DYING in a fantasy novel!)While i respect and have enjoyed the work of David Eddings, Robert Jordan etc one book or series always follows the usual pattern (prophecy stories particularly grate) with cliched good guys and equally unoriginal and transparent opponents. One of the compliments paid to George Martins series is that it is fantasy reminescent of history, namely the Wars of the Roses in England which demonstrate his ability to create a truly believable world - a rare skill among writers of the genre. If you like your books full of princes raised as peasants only to fulfill a prophecy to save the fair(but secretly dangerous) maiden and righteously defeat the evil king then steer clear of this series, what sets Martin apart from the standard writers of fantasy is that he writes for mature readers, this is no happy good versus evil childrens book.

B000148KK2|4.0|Although I agree with many reviewers that the lack of standards is a change when listening to Diana, they are forgetting that if no one ever attempted to write anything new we will have those same standards until the end of time.  The music itself has wonderful flow and is worth listening to on it's own merit.  The lyrics do come up lacking in certain places, but not enough to be troubling.  Overall a decent addition to Krall's discography and something nice to add to your collection.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|This second feature by Satoshi Kon, like &quot;Ice Age&quot;, spins off of John Ford's 1948 western &quot;Three Godfathers&quot; as a Christmas allegory of three grown men trying to deal with an orphaned baby.  This time, we have a runaway teenaged girl, an alcoholic ex-athlete and a middle-aged drag queen who form a kind of family in the underworld of Tokyo's homeless.  The discovery of a baby in a trash dump takes them all over town for the week between Christmas and New Years (thus starting on a Christmas holy day and ending on a Shinto/Buddhist holiday), with the coincidences and miracles becoming more and more improbable yet ultimately satisfying.<br />This hasn't been dubbed into English, which is just as well, because the original voices are perfect, from the hysterics of the runaway to the completely unfeminine voice of the drag queen (if it HAS to be dubbed in future, better that Harvey Fierstein takes the role of Hana).  And while this movie and the anime series &quot;Witch Hunter Robin&quot; give intriguing glimpses into post-Bubble homelessness in Japan, and a feature on the subject would have been a welcome extra, I can see why the DVD producers didn't dwell on it.  Still, a great movie from a great director.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|Chariot is an amazing CD by a truly amazing artist. Gavin's voice is beautiful. There isn't a single bad song on the CD. It's really that great. Gavin DeGraw is a truly unique and wonderful talent that you don't get to hear very often. I give it 11 out of 10. It's brilliant.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|D12 World is an aight album and some pretty dope tracks but definetely cannot be labeled as a classic piece of hip-hop history. Eminem handles the majority of the production on the album but there are also tracks by Dre, Trackmasterz, Denaun Porter e.t.c. The beats create a very different feel to their previous LP and some can be quite annoying, but is overall pretty tight. The best track on the LP is 'Good Die Young' which displays a lot of emotion and the Bugz skit is damn dope.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Peter Jackson pulled off the impossible -- he translated an over-written yet beloved epic into a riveting trilogy.  And yet even with dividing &quot;LOTR&quot; into three long films, Jackson was forced to make dramatic cuts in the story in order to make it fit.  Fans of the books will love this extended version of the film, as it fleshes out the story.  Extended scenes between the hobbits and the Ents, Faramir and Boromir, the relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn, and Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor are treats.<br />Did Jackson make some departures from Tolkein's novels?  Sure -- he had to, if for no other reason than Tolkein's dialogue is about as dull as can be imagined.  Still, Jackson has faithfully recreated Middle Earth and its stock of beloved characters.  The ensemble cast throws themselves into the roles with gusto, and the special effects are amazing.  <br />The major surprise in this film is the emergence of Gollum (formerly Smeagol), the tortured Ring Bearer from whom Bilbo stole the Ring in &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;  Using CGI, Jackson uses a boffo performance from Andy Serkis (even though Mr. Serkis is never seen because Jackson superimposed CGI over Serkis' form) to create the most fully realized computer-generated character ever.  <br />The extra DVD discs show that this project was obviously a labor of love for those concerned, and their cinematic accomplishments are even more amazing when you see the process of how the film was made.  These DVD extras are worth it!
B00005JMSE|5.0|As far as comic book adaptations go, Hellboy might just be on the top three ever. In spite of it being one of the lesser known characters in the comic world, Guillermo del Toro has gone and made an awesome movie that can easily appeal to both fans and non-fans alike.<br />Back in the waning days of WWII, the Nazis tried to bring to life the son of the devil to help them win the war and rule the world, but the allies luckily were able to stop them and instead took the creature under their protection. Thus, the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense was born and Hellboy, as we became known, was raised under the tutelage of Professor Broom (Hurt). He grows up to become a fighter against all evil things paranormal in the company of a couple of other 'freaks', Abe Sapien (Jones / Hyde Pierce), the fish-man with telepathic abilites, and Liz Sheridan (Blair), the fire starter for whom Hellboy has feelings.<br />It all goes awry when Rasputin (Roden) comes back from the dark side and schemes to use Hellboy to open the gates of hell. For this he uses the help of Kroenen (Beran), a creepy, almost immortal being and Ilsa (Hodson), his lover and servant, to set free the demon Sammael.<br />Del Toro manages to bring to life one of the most farfetched mythologies in comic book-dom by using the perfect actors to play the characters, writing an encapturing screenplay and using great make-up (Rick Baker!) and vissual effects teams to create Hellboy's world (filmed mostly in Prague). Ron Perlman simply IS Hellboy. His arrogance and teenage immaturity come through perfectly. Blair is gorgeous as the troubled Liz, although she is given very little screen time.<br />In a world were most films based on comic books turn out to be crap, Hellboy is truly a triumph. A great story, with great characters, beautifully filmed by a filmmaker who devoted seven years to this project.<br />If you're not already a fan of this character, you will be one by the time you finish watching this movie!ie!
1592400876|5.0|I have not yet read the substance of this book, though I have ordered it.  But in reading reviews of it as well as descriptions of the content, I am enormously impressed.  As a senior psychologist now having done professional work for 46 years it is axiomatic to me that human beings, while being emotionally neurotic and even psychotic in a variety of ways, inevitably also have enormous difficulties with REALITY.  (As of course do all living organisms.)  (To counter the absurd idea that &quot;no one really knows what REALITY is&quot; I offer the simple definition: REALITY is &quot;what exists.&quot;)  In this regard it is language -- including words, meanings, concepts, punctuation -- which help our brains understand and interpret external (and internal) REALITY.  The more precise and accurately we use language, in its various forms, the more effective we may potentially be in dealing with the difficulties of what has been called our being-in-the-world.  This book, obviously interesting and written with great charm, has an additional and unusually important value in calling our attention to the difficulties of perceiving, understanding and interpreting REALITY -- so that we, as human beings, may be more self-benefiting and less self-defeating. Even before reading it fully, I can say I LOVE this book.

0790729628|5.0|Someday he'll be Sir Ridley, no doubt, but now he's just Tony Scott's big brother. Blade Runner is one of better movies made either of the science fiction genre or of the noir mystery genre, or both. I imagine of the science fiction-mystery noir genre it may be the only one.<br />It is a thinking persons movie because it doesn't leave all the questions answered. Is Sean Young a Replicant? Is Harrison Ford a Replicant? Is there a secondary or tertiary meaning in Rutger Hauer's escaped Replicant that is not dissimilar to Pierre Boulle's &quot;Planet of the Apes?&quot;<br />That Ford argued with Scott on the emphasis of &quot;to be or not to be&quot; regarding his role as a/the 'blade runner' along with the silly voiceover about which art regrettably had to bow to money has given the story of the movie almost as much interest as the story.<br />All characters are well played; the movie is stark and surreal; highly recommended. Larry Scantlebury
0393307050|4.0|On second reading: the prose is still splendid and the wry humor is now more understandable (full of allusive lingo and obscure situations). Capt. Aubrey's meaty speech and amusing malapropisms more intensely entertain. On the other hand, the shockingly unexpected situations are of course less so now. This is perhaps the most exciting volume in O'Brian's 20-book series. This first volume is awash in emotional extremes of hope and despair, women, allusions to sexual escapades, frequent battles, swashbuckling adventures, challenges to authority, and a surprising number of floggings (these are all toned down in later, more languid volumes). O'Brian includes a few explanations of the characters' backgrounds and motives, and, unusually, a few helpful comments on seamanship under sail occasioned by the ignorant landsman and ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin, who strikes up a happy acquaintance with Capt. Jack Aubrey. I also realize now that O'Brian shamefully gives Jack a great pass, nay two, at his court-martial, where the matter neither of his orders nor his conduct of a convoy is raised. <br />If this is your first entry into the Age of Fighting Sail, I urge you to study carefully the single illustration of a square-rigged sail plan, committing to memory their names and puzzling the use of each rope in the standing and the running rigging. O'Brian's stories are so much more more enjoyable if they are intelligible! He  does immerse us directly in an antique world without so much as a by your leave. <br />If you like O'Brian's prose and pace, I pray you go back and read his The Golden Ocean and The Unknown Shore before continuing, in which you will gain the acquaintance, sir, of both an earlier Royal Navy and your illustrious author developing the prototypes of our prodigious heroes, Jack and Stephen. Acquiring a copy of Dean King's compendium, A Sea of Words, is also not amiss.
B0001Z363W|5.0|It is interesting seeing differing takes on this album.  I do agree that is album is different from Zakk's Book of Shadows. Hangover Music vol. VI gets five stars because the music is developed and I find myself listening to it over and over again. This is a BLS album and takes a great direction. There is music growth and experimentation here. Zakk expands blending sounds on this ablum, his solos are showing growth here. The main problem a lot of folks that are down on this album are having that is it is mellower and down toned.  This is the wrong reason to rip on this album. Versitility are becoming rare with big name musicans these days, Zakk does a great job expanding and showing his versitility on this album.  I have many guitar influences myself. I love the metal side blended with the Allman Brothers band feel (listen to &quot;Woman don't cry&quot;, close your eyes you can hear Duane Allman). Listen to this cd over and over again, as a musician you have to appreciate this album, I definitely feel it. There have been a couple of very ignorant reviews of this cd, disregard them. Grab your cold ones and kick back with BLS. This album is a keeper and worth your cash!
B0001ENYKS|5.0|There is not much to say about Franz Ferdinand that hasn't been already mentioned on the press, tv, radio, etc. This album is simply exquisite, ellegant and overall enjoyable. The electro-pop music spiced up with some of the most sensual lines in music lyricism only serves to rocket this tiny piece of fiber to the place it belongs: up there with the great ones. Franz cannot afford to make a dull song or write a silly chorus line. They are changing music now.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|If you just want to see how the people lived, joked and dressed during napoleonic times, it's a good movie. If you want to watch an action movie, or a movie that has a line to follow and will keep you on the edge of your seat, look elsewhere. This is not the movie. It's more documentary type than anything else. Not worth the money to rent it!
B00008PW2D|4.0|I tend to think I am a lot of things in life. But ultimately I am the brown eyed Boston girl with one exception; I hate the Boston Red Sox. I watch Sex and the City because I feel as though I was switched at birth, I feel that NYC is my home. This has to do with my Yankees obsession and my love of Fifth Avenue. <BR>    I will not dispute that this season was too short however it was still full of the same smart witty oneliners and plots that I not only know but love. My favorite is I Love A Charade because I feel a part of someone's wedding charade. I take great pleasure in the fact that I am living this episode only it is not over in 24 minutes but ends in August when 'L' marries 'M'. We collectively know it will not last but something within us all wants it to last and want L to be happy. <BR>    I cannot stand in the way of someone's happiness even if I do not agree with it. I think we would all play along with the sad and distrubing picture of L's wedding than tell her she is wrong. She is all about be in an and relationship and making we appointments. I am not one for this because this city girl values fashion, Newbury Street, walks in the Charles and lives in the Fens. I am independent and find great comfort in the comfort of my friends. So in the grand scheme of things I conclude with a toast. <BR>    I tip my apple martini to that episode for relationships that have a bit of hope, for singeltons on the dance floor and for the lilacs and butterflies that add beauty to the city that never sleeps and to her, the city girl within us all.
B000002JOF|4.0|With his Mark Knophler style smoky baritone voice with a cool, mellow delivery, Chris Rea puts together a dark semi-concept album with \\"The Road To Hell\\" that flows very smoothly with some of his best material of his career. Hard to believe this is the same artist that did the 1978 hit \\"Fool (If You Think It's Over)\\" as most of his career has taken place in the U.K. with very little exposure here in the U.S. Rea's tight band cooks very well with a bluesy assault throughout \\"The Road To Hell\\". <br />Though each song is enjoyable with the usual Rea wistful sentimentality, one song that stands out for all-time for me is the fantastic, smooth \\"Texas\\". This classic track starts out with Rea's mellow voice and dialog accompanied with a very enjoyable, keen vibe-keyboard rhythm groove backdrop as he \\"talks\\" to his wife to consider moving the family to Texas. The song eventually smoothly energizes with a tight Joe Walsh-like sounding/style bluesy guitar that again flows so smooth and is absolutely awesome. The state of Texas should be proud of \\"Texas\\"!!! You will enjoy this album!!!
B00005JMSE|2.0|Usually, I find comic book adaptations incredibly corny and campy. One of the main reasons why a comic book should stay a comic book is because of the difficulties of translating the visuals into live-action sets and actors. Being a Mike Mignola fan, I decided to watch this film, but with reservations about dropping 10 bucks on a potentially, lame-looking movie. First of all, if Hellboy was real, he?ll look exactly like Ron Perlman. Mr. Perlman isn?t as tall as he looks in movies (he?s about 6?, maybe a hair less, but a giant compared to Tom Cruise) and he isn?t exactly muscular. As Hellboy, however, he looks exactly like the hero from the comic book.<br />For some reason, Guillermo Del Toro?s Spanish films have more sophisticated plot and character developments. Films like Cronos and The Devil?s Backbone are filled with subtle nuances that are quite enjoyable and unexpected. The minute he takes his work to Hollywood, they becomes big budgeted B-movies. The greatest thing about Mignola?s Hellboy was the fact that it was based on actual historical myths and the occult, which gave it a real dark edge.<br />In the movie adaptation, all these things are missing, which isn?t hard to explain, because they tend to be things that cannot translate to film. I found the inclusion of Agent John Meyers to be incredibly dull, although Rupert Evans might just be a bad actor. I also found the script boring and lacking of any true depth. The romance between Hellboy and Liz Sherman seemed very unnecessary. Also in the comic book, the evil villian, Rasputin was a horrific character, that was truly insane and truly frightening. In the movie, he is a whimpy bald-headed fellow with stupid looking sunglasses. Not to say that this movie wasn?t entertaining (the scene with the talking corpse comes to mind.) But, if you had a choice to see this movie or go out for a cheeseburger with fries, I would suggest spending your money at your favorite diner.
B00005JKHN|4.0|I love this movie. It's one of my favorite earlier Disney films. I love all of the colors and the music. I personally think that this is one of Disney's better Fairy Tale adaptation. The movie just really flowed well with every thing.
B00005Y228|5.0|I have never been a fan of Kylie Minogue, in fact, after her saccharine rendition of &quot;Locomotion&quot;, I would never imagine myself actually buying anything associated with Ms. Minogue. However, maybe the television commercials for the gym franchise which featured her moved me to buy it. Maybe it was a  post 9-11 attempt at an aural happy pill. Either way, once purchased, this cd spent many moons spinning on my stereo. My friends and I enjoyed playing every track repeatedly and rather loud. Weight was lost with the booty shakin' and throats were parched with the bad karaoke. Fun was had by all! Just wish her earlier work was as interesting and well produced.
B000002J1H|5.0|Yes released this magnificent, often overlooked gem in 1977: a time when art rock was being scoffed at as pretentious and overblown. Punk had surged forth, and Johnny Rotten & Co. had a field day ripping Yes, Pink Floyd, Queen and others. It would appear during that time (at least during the making of this album), the members of Yes didn't give a darn about the trends of the day, as their usual cosmic, soaring, mystical aesthetic pervades the album in a big way (which is a good thing.)<br /><br />The music on here is splendid - soaring, lush, illuminating -- an orgasm for the soul. Jon Anderson's vocals soar high, Steve Howe's guitar playing stuns as usual, and is very fluid, Chris Squire's (and Steve's) backing, majestic vocals blend magnificently with Jon's (and not to mention the man's bass playing), Rick Wakeman (who makes his return with Yes for the first time since 1973's _Tales From Topographic Oceans_) supplies his virtuosic, classically-oriented flourishes not just through synthesizers, but also a church organ, and other types of keyboards.<br /><br />Alan White is possibly one of the most underacknowledged drummers out there. His drumming skills possibly go largely unnoticed due to the overpowering cosmic front brought on by the other members of the band. With this powerfully compelling, lush exterior Yes possesses, how could one possibly be fully aware of subtle nuances that are arguably beneath the surface? While many of us are being lifted higher to some heavenly place, it is all too common to miss the technical brilliance that is going on. Alan's drumming is the perfect example for this. While all of the cosmic stuff is knocking us sideways, Alan is in the background doing all sorts of creative and impressive things on the kit: his sense of time, the creative use (and placement) of the cymbals and snare hits during a certain meter, and other subtle things should not be taken lightly. This is just one of the many, many, many reasons why I think Yes are special: they possess technical brilliance, but they have something else as well -- something that's arguably even more powerful and intangible than their technical abilities.<br /><br />The title track, while cosmic and grand, is quite raucous, mostly due to the steel guitar musings from Steve Howe. It can be grating at times, but it also helps to give the track a harder edge. The rhythmical quality of the vocals during the bridge (repeated once more before the ending) is quite creative and seductive. This, and more, help to lead up to the orgasmic, goosebump-inducing climax of the song, which feature choral effects from the vocal harmonies.<br /><br />\\"Turn of The Century\\" is a smooth, mystical, ballad with a new age aesthetic. The lyrics on here are touching, and the soundscapes are ethereal and image-inducing as ever. Jon's vocals are outstanding as always. Sonic textures mostly brought on by Steve's musings during the middle of the track give way to the ethereal, majestic climax near the end of the song.<br /><br />\\"Parallels\\" is written by Chris Squire, and is grand and soaring as ever. Rick's use of the church organ here certainly adds more of a mystical, spiritual and regal quality to the track. This track, while cosmic on the outside, is quite busy underneath it all. Check out the time changes, the multiple vocal layers, and the instrumentation that is going on all at once -- Rick's keyboard lines, Steve's guitar lines, Chris' basslines, and Alan's drumming.<br /><br />\\"Wonderous Stories\\" is much like \\"Turn of The Century\\" -- a ballad with a mystical, new age aesthetic. Jon's vocals, as always, are precious and moving. Steve's guitar lines here are quite melodic, and what's impressive are how well they blend in with the rest of the instrumentation.<br /><br />\\"Awaken\\" is classic. Like the rest of the album -- but more specifically, here --  it is almost impossible to put into account the effect it has on me. It's the 15-minute closer of the album, and boy,is it ever so good. Grand, lush, soaring, illuminating -- this track soars, and it shines as bright as the sun. The massive bed of sound just smothers your senses, and does not let go. Yes even got a church choir to add their voices in certain parts of the track. It is the most goosebump-inducing song on the album, and is also my favorite Yes song. There is quite a bit of stuff going on here -- the vocal harmonies are penetrating, the basslines tasteful, Steve's solos orgasmic. On a different listening session, when you're not being seduced by the powerful cosmic aura of this music -- or when you're trying your hardest not to be -- pay attention to the technical stuff going on in these songs. In this track, one of the many things I'd like to talk about is Alan's drumming: pay special attention to what Alan is doing on the drum kit, especially during the \\"suns high streams thru,\\" \\"strong dreams reign here,\\" and \\"star, song, age, less\\" sections of the track. It's quite nifty.<br /><br />This is an excellent album from Yes. Highly recommended -- that is, if you are a Yes fan, own (and love) all of their studio albums, particularly from the 1971-1974 period, but do not own this. Don't pass it by.-- this track soars, and it shines as bright as the sun. The massive bed of sound just smothers your senses, and does not let go.

B00005R2M3|2.0|I give this cd two stars because there are only two tracks of merit. Underneath Your Clothes and Whenever, Wherever are fresh, funky and fun. The rest of the cd is a total sucky letdown. However, those two tracks are very different, which means there's hope for Shakira that she may yet have a few surprises in store for fans. That is an as yet unproven mathematic probability, but a probability none the less. Besides, with Gloria Estefan holding your hand, how can you fail?
B0000X81ZI|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this film, and when it started with its 'ShawScope' logo, its 'Feature Presentation' card, and its opening statement 'A Band Apart' I thought I was watching a completely different movie. But when I finally released that yes, it WAS Kill Bill Volume 1, I loved the whole thing. And is it just me, or is the warning of requirements for strong stomachs just added to praise the excellent Quentin Tarantino? There's no denying it is gory, and graphic, especially when the Bride cuts a woman's arm off with a samurai sword, but I never felt the urge to leave the room and go throw up. Anyone under 12 probably will though, so don't let kids watch it. But Tarantino has still created another flawless masterpiece filled with action and great acting, which satisfies me right now because I haven't seen Volume 2 yet.
0517122707|5.0|This book made me laugh.<br />Rather a lot actually. Ignatius Reilly is disgusting in just about every way imaginable, and man is it funny. His extraordinary opinions (about everything), plots, mannerisms, size, hygiene, and friends bring him and the people around him into the most absurd situations imaginable, and it's all you can do to keep from getting a stomach ache laughing at them so hard (the ab exercise this novel offers is truly remarkable). Each of the characters, Jones (my favorite), Ignatius's mother, Trixi (my other favorite), Mr. and Mrs. Levy, Patrolman Mancuso, strikes me as a literary comic marvel. The whirlwind plot ensnaring all of these lives is so brilliant. You can feel the comic tensions building and building until a final explosion hits that is as large as Ignatius himself.<br />The book is also sad. Walker Percy (my favorite author) mentions in the introduction the suicide of the author, and that is part of the sadness. But there's more. The humor in the novel springs from the latent despair in each characters lives and their (for the most part) stuggle to change something. It feels as though the fates are in control of the novel, and they are out to offer a bit of sorrow and a bit of hope.<br />Confederacy of Dunces is a book that can be taken a lot of ways. As entertainment, this is one of the most funny books I've read, but there is a sense of gravity here making this one of the most remarkable novels I've read. It's quite a masterpiece that I'll read again and again.
B000067J24|5.0|&quot;Woman on Top&quot; was one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The bedroom love scenes were some of the most beautifully portrayed and sensual that I've ever seen without all of the nudity and vulgarity usually portrayed in American made movies.  The scenes of the beautiful,Bahia,Brazil especially it's Peulorinho district where Isabella and Toninho live are also very beautifully portrayed and no place in the world is more lovely than the Peulorinho at night. Having travelled to Bahia I can testify that Bahia definitely has a magical feel and visitors to Bahia often remark,&quot;Bahia Enfeitica&quot; which means &quot;Bahia casts its spell on you&quot; and well it might given the number of African deities called Orixas that are worshipped in Bahia.  Yemanja is often referred to as the &quot;Mother of the Orixas&quot; and offerings are frequently made to Her by Brazilians to incur Her blessings especially on New Year's Eve where everyone in Brazil goes to the beach at night with their offerings in hand all dressed in white. This movie is far from a fairytale as it beautifully portrays how the Orixas are very much appreciated in the daily lives of Brazilians.The directors of this movie were thoughtful enough to engage well-known Candomble priestesses Mae Lucia and Mae Stella to get an accurate portrayal of Candodmble and it's rituals.  I thought that Penelope Cruz and Murilo Benicio did a wonderful job as a married couple and they have a wonderful chemistry together on the screen and although both have their flaws as individuals they learn by combining their strengths how to create the perfect dish.  I highly recommend this DVD to people especially those that have an interest in Bahia and Candomble or just want to view a beautifully,portrayed love story. The soundtrack is also a wonderful addition to the movie. Yemanja be praised!!!
B000056TKD|5.0|Among recommended recordings of Also Sprach Zarathrustra by Richard Strauss, this is one seldom mentioned. Before this recording, I listened to Tennstedt, Reiner (1964) and Karajan and only this recording blows me away. Listening it in my car, living room stereo, or even through my Discman, this recording is exciting. There is lush lyricism, massive voices and fiery passion, despite the speed of this recording that could turn off seasoned Straussians. The famous introduction has the best organ chord at the end, I think largely due to the accoustics of Boston Symphony Hall, one of the best in the world. The strings surprisingly has Viennese nuances and the highlight is Joseph Silverstein's solo performance, which is a delight to listen to and my favorite *concertmaster* violinist. The recording has sardonical wit and humor that all Zarathrustra recordings I hear lacked. <br />The Planets, no need to for me to add, is a reference performance, although \\"Jupiter\\" for me is too dry and lacked the excitement of Boult and Rattle has. Sadly there are too few of Steinberg's recordings with Boston Symphony and they're finished when Ozawa took over. Can James Levine bring them back to the former glory of kouzzevetsky, Munch or Steinberg?
B0000CGV00|5.0|This innovative programme works.  If more CDs can provide new perspectives to modern and classic canon through such careful (though risky) programming, the Internet will not be so much of a threat to the industry. Much we can learn from Hlne Grimaud.<BR>Grimaud's Beethoven is powerful, and Avon Part's finale is a joy.  Some may not like his allusion to Bach, but I find it refreshing of the greatest moments of Bach, Charles Ives, as well as Part himself.
B000002H6C|5.0|And if you disagree with me..that's okay. But you're wrong. But seriously, I find it quite odd that me, a bassist, would feel that this is even the best Metallica record ever, let alone the best metal record. This is the first post-Cliff Burton Metallica effort, and new bassist Jason Newsted can't be heard anywhere on it. But the wierd thing is, everything fits together on this album so well, you don't miss it at all. &quot;Blackened,&quot; a classic Metallica thrasher, opens the record and immediately commands your full attention. &quot;One,&quot; the band's first single and video, might have become their signature song had the band not taken a radically different direction on later albums. The massive length of the songs, coupled with the listener's total lack of desire to hit the skip button, says a lot about the songwriting skills of these guys. The music of &quot;....And Justice For All&quot; is more closely related to classical pieces than standard heavy metal. And though a lot of people bemoan the unorthodox sound of this record, I think that it works beautifully for these songs. I can't very well place this one above &quot;Master Of Puppets,&quot; but given a choice, &quot;Justice&quot; will always be the one I put in my changer.
0743454529|1.0|I could not put this book down. I thought the premise was intriguing and the way that the author switched narrators very clever.  <BR>I was so upset at the ending that I felt like throwing the book against the wall. What a cop-out.

1592400876|5.0|Only an Englishwoman would vent for two hundred pages on the proper uses of the comma and the apostrophe. <br />&quot;Two hundred pages of apostrophes!&quot; you exclaim. <BR>&quot;Yes, and commas,&quot; come the reply.<BR>&quot;What on earth could she say in two hundred pages that which a fourth former could not learn in a semester at Hotchkiss?&quot; you muse.<br />And indeed that is the very point Ms. Truss raises. A book like this is necessary because grammar and punctuation are no longer taught in school, even in England. So a review is necessary before we Americans drown in a sea of missed directions and misplaced modifiers.<br />Fortunately for fourth formers at Hotchkiss, and even Andover and Woodberry Forest, Ms. Truss is funny in the dry, boring way that the British are most often funny. Now I know about Monty Python and if you are expecting that kind of humor, you will be sorely disappointed. If, however, you simply wish to laugh as you write the last great prep school novel in a form that indicates you in fact attended prep school, buy this book. If that seems like a lot to ask for the sake of a comma, check it out of the library.<br />Thank you.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I rented this movie and I really liked it!! The storyline was well written and brought out. I was not bored at all with this movie...every scene I wanted to know what will happen or just the scenes were just very interesting to me. Big Fish is a kind of movie where you stop and think about certain things because its soo unusual and different. I thought Ewan McGregor did a great job and Albert Finney. They protrayed their characters really well and made me part of their adventurous journey. I wouldn't mind to see it again!!! If you like fantasy, humor, and something touching...watch it!!! Recommend you rent it first though...to see if you REALLY enjoy it! And if you do love it...don't hesitate...BUY IT!!!
B000002J09|5.0|This is the Zeppelin CD with their biggest hits, and it is also one of their best.  There is no excess baggage...you can crank it up and let it play without having to worry about skipping over a sub-par track (this comes in quite handy at parties).  The last two songs are especially awesome, so don't think you can pop it out after &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;
B00005YUNY|4.0|I was hesitant to buy this, I'm wary of wheeling out old rock stars, no matter how much I used to like them. But I paid my money and I haven't regreted it. This is an outstanding performance of many of their classics. 'Gates of Delirium' is terrific. If you ever liked Yes, you will enjoy this. The animations are a dud though.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I have to say that if you buy this album you won't be disapointed. Most of the song's on this album just blew my mind. Songs like I'll Be Damned, 6 in the Morning, Get My Gun, 40oz., Difently American Psycho II with (B-Real) is awsome. So if you are thinkin' about buying this album it is worth the money.

B000000WF0|5.0|Like most people, I fell in love with The Verve after hearing &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot;. I heard it on Cruel Intentions, and then bought the soundtrack. I'd never heard anything like it before, because it was so beautiful and powerful and dreamlike all at the same time. Slowly, I had heard other songs from them, and I was thinking &quot;This is a REALLY good band!&quot; And then, for Christmas, I got this album.<BR>This has to be one of the best albums ever made. The songs are beautiful, every single one of them. I don't get bored or irritated with any of them. <BR>They band has a unique sound. It's comforting, beautiful, psychedelic, blurry.. it takes complete grasp of your senses and takes it somewhere wonderful.<BR>I reccomend it to anyone who's heard something by them before. They may end up being an aquired taste, but they're one hell of an aquired taste!
B00005JLKN|5.0|Hannibal the Cannibal is back with a vengeance, though in fact it is his first episode. This thriller is marvellously well done. The killer aims at women, but the FBI agent who is going to solve the problem has retired after arresting Doctor Lecter, after finding out Doctor Lecter was the criminal he was looking for with the doctor's help, misguiding help, of course. It is when the cop understands that the killer kills his victims to eat them, in fact to serve them to his guests that he understands the Doctor is the killer. But this retired FBI agent who goes back into service in this new case discovers with imagination, vision, intelligence and observation some facts about and characteristics of the killer. But this is not enough. He has to profile the killer psychologically and this is very difficult. So he tries to cut the task short with the help of Doctor Lecter and this help is expensive in privileges or in manipulations. The doctor even goes beyond and becomes really dangerous, looking for his own vengeance. But this is not enough, yet, to arrest the killer. The cops have to sweep wide and comb thin to get across small details that become big opportunities. Once again it is observation that is essential, but with imagination and inspiration. Once the cops have found the small detail that is going to lead them on the road to the killer things are easier, though not at all less dangerous. And the killer plans the reactions of the cops and takes them into account in his own plans, which enables him to come with an ending that is quite different from what we are all expecting. This film, like the book behind, is interesting because it reveals that serial killers have to be intelligent, creative and extremely good chess players. They have to plan ahead enormously and foresee the reactions of the police. In other words, these killers would have been good cops if they were not moved by the desire to kill or even make other people suffer. But this film insists on the severe childhood years this killer has been through and how he inherited of his killing instinct from the mistreatment he got from his own relatives. What happens when he finds himself alone, no longer dominated and controled by these relatives ? He is haunted by them and kills in order to pacify them. And it is understanding this that makes the cop able to solve the last stage in the thriller. We can even wonder if a cop does not have to become a bodydouble or a clone of the killer to be able to find him and arrest or stop him.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUsevere childhood years this killer has been through and how he inherited of his killing instinct from the mistreatment he got from his own relatives.

B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Alirght, well its not fair to compare Perfect Circle to Tool because they are 2 different bands that both are trying to do different things musically. But Maynard makes me think Tool every time he opens his mouth, so comparing is natural. Anyway, great CD if you want a more mellow style of Tool. Ratings are below...<br />1. The Package  3.5/5-  Good song, very long, reminds you of a Tool intro to a CD, about 8 minutes long.<BR>2. Weak and Powerless 4/5- awesome song, the first single on the CD<BR>3. The Noose  4.5/5-  Awesome song. I overlooked it for the first few weeks of having this CD. The chorus is amazing.<BR>4. Blue    3.5/5-  Another good song, gets a bit old, great musically though.<BR>5. Vanishing  3.5/5- Acutally reminds me a lot of &quot;Blue&quot;<BR>6. Stranger - Hard to rank because it is only about 2 1/2 minutes and more of an intro to the next song.<BR>7. The Outsider  5/5- Just a great song, amazing lyrics, great chorus. Good all around.<BR>8. Crimes- intro type song again<BR>9. The Nurse Who Loved me  1/5- Where the HELL did this song come in, its terrible!!<BR>10. Pet  4/5-  Heavier than most on the track, good song<BR>11. Lullaby- Intro<BR>12. Gravity  3.5/5-  Good song, not heavy enough to end a CD though, just my opinion.
B00008LDPU|4.0|Well, even if you don't ignore the second and third movies you HAVE to include this as an important part of the series.  Not all the episodes are brilliant, but a few give valuable insight into the background of the film story.  My favorite may be the kids playing in a \\"broken\\" area of the matrix, where the rules of physics don't seem to apply.  But others include the history or the human/robot war and an incident reffered to briefly in the second film.<br />You cannot consider yourself a fan of the Matrix and not include this in your library.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I was completely blown away when I first heard Gavin's CD. It's absolutly incredible. Sheer musical delight from the moment the first note is struck to the last. Gavin's voice and lyrics seem beyound his years and his talent undeniable. &quot;Chariot&quot; is an album sprinked with just the right ingredients to become one of those rare albums that manage to touch your entire being. &quot;This is the start of something good, don't you agree?&quot; One listen to this record and you will no doubt be yelling yes at the top of your lungs.
B00005NOOH|5.0|This is a great series about WWII. However, the boxed set came with a missing volume 2. The set contained a second volume 1 DVD instead of volume 2. This was very disappointing.

6303022901|5.0|Having spent a year in China (1948), I admit to a soft spot for the Chinese people and their stories, and especially for Amy Tan, whose books I have read and loved.  This superlative movie was based on her book of the same name.<br /><br />In this story (the script was written by Tan and Ronald Bass) the tension between four Chinese women, who were born in China and later came to the United States, and their Americanized daughters, is the foundation of the story, and is the theme that epitomizes Amy Tan's stories.  She has noted in an interview that such tension existed in her own life between her and her own mother.<br /><br />Much of the tension is due to the cultural clash.  Times in China were hard a few short decades ago, and life was harsh. Starvation and disease was rife even in later years, when I was there in the late 'forties.  When Americans today refer to poverty or hunger in this country, they have no conception of the real poverty and hunger that existed in China in the 'thirties and 'forties, or customs like the very painful historical binding of women's feet, which in effect crippled them for life, in the name of beauty, or the custom of wealthy Chinese men often having multiple wives and concubines, or the total degradation of women which existed and was totally accepted throughout the culture. Not to mention the impact of continuing warfare between warlords, the nationalists (Kuomintang) and communists, and the Japanese occupation all of which lasted for generations.<br /><br />This is an emotion evoking story.  It is more than simply entertainment; it is a story with which you will identify, with characters with which you will empathize.<br /><br />Amy Tan knows whereof she writes, and her stories are compelling and sympathy evoking.  Another Chinese woman who wrote her autobiography which touched on some of the same themes, who was in Tsingtao when I was, and whose tale enchanted me, was Dr. H. Mei Lu, who now lives in Honolulu, and whose book was titled, \\"Grandfather's Microscope\\" q.v.  Coming from a humble background, in China, she became an esteemed pathologist in the United States.  I heartily recommend her book as well as Amy Tan's, for any Sinophile.  These ladies both write extremely well, and have immensely interesting things to say.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus<br />and other booksse book was titled, \\"Grandfather's Microscope\\" q.v.

B0001Z53CY|1.0|I Only Give This Album 1 Star Because It had Some OK Joints. Overall It Is A Huge Letdown, It Seems Like Its All Over The Place, No Real Direction And The Album Has Some Just Plain Wack Verses, Eminem Didn't Even Come Off Nice Here. Really Disappointing After Devil's Night, Which I Thought Was A Pretty Good Album. The Production Is Very Mediocre, With Cuts Like My Band And 40Oz With Very Simple And Repetitive Beats. D12 Seemed Like Even They Didn't Know What They Were Doing. The One Track I Wanted To Really Like Was &quot;American Psycho 2&quot; Featuring B-Real But Even That Song Got On My Nerves, The Hook Was Very Simple And Annoying VERY Annoying. Not Impressed At All, Hopefully Eminem's Solo Album Will Be Better.
B0000029GA|5.0|As a fan of rap music, I consider Nas to be gifted with the art of making music.  That reviewer, peterjah, hasn't listened completely to Nas's lyrics to even know what he rapping about.  Nas reaches out to the community and to put him down is a disservice.  Sure there are artists that get carried away, but this one is damn good enough for me!
B0000009S3|5.0|This is the first FZ album I heard, and after 3 listens, I was hooked.  The open-jams &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot; and &quot;Gumbo Variations&quot; are sweet grooving sweat-sessions.  And this album has smooth polished compositions &quot;Peaches&quot; and &quot;Little Umbrellas&quot; and &quot;It Must Be A Camel&quot; making this a well-rounded album for those unfamiliar with the established genius of Frank Zappa.  <BR>  That's Captain Beefheart singing on &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot; and that's Shugie Otis playing bass on &quot;Peaches.&quot;<BR>  After this album, you might check out &quot;Apostrophe&quot; and &quot;Overnight Sensation.&quot; Especially if you can get them both on one disk (look around this bargain)!<br />  Now, repeat after me...<BR>&quot;I'm a little pimp with my hair gassed back<BR>Pair a khaki pants with my shoe shined black..&quot;
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I would have to agree with Michael Elliot about that one blindly &quot;patriotic&quot; guy, A Music Fan, who wrote a negative review, probably without even hearing the album, just because there's an upside-down american flag. What an pathetically ignorant bandwagoner. I bet he's the type that never gave the flag a second look or thought if ever he once glanced up to look at it before 9/11, yet now stubbornly defends it from any perceived offence, regardless of logic or foundation. Stuff like that simply pisses me off. Bet he was one of those ethnocentric jackasses who had, like, twelve flags on his truck too.<br />Anyway, on to that album. This one is my personal favorite from Ryan Adams' rather prolific career. &quot;New York, New York&quot; was the first Ryan Adams song I ever heard, and it's the reason I bought this record. Kind of a big risk for a college student with access to both iTunes and MyTunes (which I have since deleted), but I believe a very few musicians actually deserve this money.<br />Adams' music could be called rather loosely constructed one-take alt-country. It's like lo-fi, if lo-fi albums were recorded with decent equipment. You almost can't tell if there's a group of professional musicians in a multi-million dollar studio, or if it's some guy in his basement with a tape loop jammin' out. The musical spectrum Ryan Adams has recorded here is quite broad; soft crooners like &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot; and mid-tempo sing-alongs like &quot;Answering Bell&quot; are placed next to each other. Yet at no point does this album feel disjointed or meandering. As a whole the album rises and falls like waves until it hits its high-water mark at &quot;Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; and slides slowly back into the sea with &quot;Goodnight, Sunset Blvd.&quot; The lyrics, however, are the highlight. Adams said in an interview that he views the actual song as the lyrics, that the music is only a vehicle for the lyrics. What are the lyrics like? Depressed,mostly, but at all times poetic and graceful. Great album, you really ought to check it out if you're into Wilco or MMJ. The burgeoning alt-country scene is picking up right now, following Wilco's lead, and I hope Ryan Adams gets his due for this incredible work.<br />Also, I wonder if that idiot realizes that the reason we have soldiers dying in Iraq is because there are too many people who, like him, believe the crap the president is trying to sell us.  Sadly, he is a part of the problem, and is too blind to realize it. Oh, the irony. I have never flaunted my nationality, even when in Europe, where they're used to guys like him, the ugly american. But I've never been ashamed to be American until people like him came about.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This is a magnificent movie, but the presentation of this special edition is amazing... loads of extras and so forth... but the best part is the near pristine print and clear sound. Special mention to the great Margaret O'Brien (who won an Oscar for this performance) and Judy, who never looked more beautiful or sang with more pizzazz. The songs are fantastic, some written for the film, and others from the period of the St. Louis Fair. Special mention is the song &quot;You and I&quot; sung by Mary Astor and Leon Ames... a lovely melody and nearly forgotten by many, but haunting and beautiful and worth a second listen. This DVD is a clear winner on every account.
B000024D4R|5.0|Wow! Every time I listen to this it gets better!<br />1-Pigs on the wing (part 1): A short yet sweet acoustic song<br />2-Dogs: The best song on the album, with great guitar<br />3-Pigs (Three different ones): Good lyrics, with weird pig noises<br />4-Sheep: Good keyboard intro<br />5-Pigs on the wing (part 2): Same as 1, but adds balance to the album<br />Go out and buy it if you haven't already! It's as good as The Wall or Dark Side!
0201633612|4.0|It is to my eternal shame that I have been a computer scientist for this long, but before this January, I had never been exposed to the Gang of Four's DESIGN PATTERNS.  In a few short months, the patterns I have learned from this book have become invaluable.  I've already started going back through my legacy code looking for badly designed structures and have gradually been upgrading my work.  If only I had known about this stuff years ago, I could have saved myself time, both during the creation of code and now, when I'm maintaining it.  <br />Software patterns are a way of preventing the programmer from reinventing the wheel.  Many of the patterns discussed in this book are refinements of procedures that have been tried and tested thousands of times over the years.  The idea is that by studying these prototypes, we can save ourselves time by standing on the shoulders of those noble computer scientists who came before us.  And it really works too.  Reading about these patterns instantly drove into my head all the places in the past where I should have been using an elegant pattern as described here, rather than the ramshackle, jury-rigged solution I created.  And I even learned more about the patterns that I was already familiar with.  Every Java programmer knows about, say, Iterator, but I found it fascinating to read about how powerful that little routine can be.<br />The book is divided into three main forms of patterns: creational patterns, structural patterns and behavioral patterns.  The patterns discussed span all portions of an object's life (the book is geared towards Object-Oriented Programming).  We learn the best way of creating objects, the best way to have them communicate with other objects, and the best way to have them running their own algorithms.  It really encourages the writing of clean code.  Decoupling objects is the order of the day, and while I already knew vaguely that this was a good idea, this book showed me why exactly this is desirable, and equally importantly, it showed me how best to implement it.<br />I was introduced to this book by enrolling in an excellent class, which walked us through the various patterns.  Given that the book has a tendency towards dryness, I would recommend this learning method to anyone.  The examples proposed on these pages are, perhaps, a little esoteric and can at times be obscure.  Because the book was written way back in the dark ages of 1994, the sample code is written in C++ and Smalltalk; we can assume that if this same book were written today, Java would reign supreme.  An instructor who has used these patterns in real applications should be able to provide the student with a plethora of easy-to-understand scenarios, to really drive home how and where these patterns should be implemented.<br />Again, don't let the relative age fool you; get this book and take a class that explains it.  If you can't find a class that teaches from this, then try to learn on your own.  The skills you'll pick up from this will be immensely rewarding.  Just be prepared to have the inevitable realization of: &quot;Oh, so that's what I should have been doing all this time!  Now where am I going to find the time to go back and fix it?&quot;
B00005JMEW|2.0|The title of this review expresses both my expectations for this movie and the expectations of many people who I know.  In the end, I am shocked because I definitely did NOT like it.  I'd like to share my experience so that you can better judge whether this movie is for you, not because I wish to demean it.<br />I love martial arts.  I usually like martial arts films, especially in the rare instances where you can use fighting effectively without completely sacrificing plot...Heck, even an attempt at plot. (Now THAT's a parody of the genre - something this movie was hailed as by some but failed to live up to.)  Thus, when several people who know me and my martial preoccupation recommended this movie very highly, it began to sound like a sure hit.  Indeed, it has all the makings of such a hit, employing many an action and/or kung fu cliché as it winds its way along.<br />Alright, I'm going to start with the good, because I don't want it to seem that I'm laying into this movie without having thought about it.<br />1. Quentin Tarentino clearly has a good handle on what makes film visually interesting.  He employs anime-styled animation, black and white, and uses color contrast to maintain variety and keep things appealing to the eye.  (Note the yellow or white on red contrast in this film used repeatedly.)  This helps keep your eyes on the screen for the most part.<br />2. The sound quality is excellent, especially the choice in music.  Because the movie is nearly constantly in motion, the music appropriately beats along with an up-tempo rhythm and serves the movie well.  You may want to get up and bust out the glo-sticks, or you may just tap your foot subconsciously.  Either way, I thought the use of sounds also drove the movie.<br />3. There's at least an attempt to justify the violence.<br />Now, my complaints.<br />1. There is simply too much gory violence for my taste, and the justification for it is weak.  I don't care if it's only bad people being killed.  I don't care if it's bad people killing bad people.  That aspect of the film didn't interest me and actually verged on bothering me.  The violence wasn't a fake, disconnected kind, and being dragged through 90-some murders isn't fun.<br />2. Uma Thurman's acting felt bland, and Lucy Liu wasn't convincing.  Ultimately, the dialogue struck me as very poor, I guess.  It serves to move the viewer from one bloody encounter to the next and lend fragments of insight as to why everyone's fighting, but aside from that it's often unnatural sounding and uninteresting.  If I bought Ms. Thurman or Ms. Liu as &quot;tough&quot;, (a failing more of the script than their acting) maybe that wouldn't have been the case.  Perhaps then this movie might have transcended to &quot;cool&quot; status, but as such it's relegated to &quot;I Bought This Without Renting It?&quot; purgatory.<br />3. A sword?  On a plane?  Yeah...Right...<br />4. The choreography is simply nothing special, and that's coming from someone who likes martial arts.  If you don't like wire work, this isn't your movie certainly, because in typical Woo Ping fashion, it's abundant here.  Also, there are the typical high-arcing sword swings which are clearly intended to make clanging sword sounds for the camera rather than to injure an opponent.  Perhaps this complaint ultimately stems from not being able to relate to any of the characters, but I couldn't suspend my disbelief and found the action boring as a result.<br />The above are really only building to this conclusion: It's sad to me that of all the things Tarantino chose to emphasize about martial arts, he chose to merely show it as violent.  And, ultimately what I got from this movie reflected just that - empty violence.  I couldn't buy the justification for it, and as such it mostly offended me.<br />Your miles may vary.  As I tried to say, the visual and audio presentation of this movie make it quite &quot;watchable&quot; - an accomplishment of its own.  If you like other Tarantino films, you'll likely enjoy this, especially if martial arts or yakuza films also interest you.<br />I can only say that the violence may also be a significant turn-off for others, and if you can't get past that, you'll likely start to look for flaws as I did above and enjoy it less.  I mean, other than violence, very little else happens in this movie, so just know what you're getting into and make your own choice.
0767020308|5.0|I was thrilled when the Gwenyth Paltrow version of \\"Emma\\" came out.  After all, I knew from reading the book that it was a great story and I was one of those Austenites reveling in the rich array of Austen adaptations created in the mid to late 90's.  When my husband bought me this version, my first thought was, \\"Emma doesn't look gorgeous.\\"  She was supposed to be breathtakingly so.  But as soon as I stopped looking at the cover and popped the movie into the VCR, I was hooked (as I realized that the beautiful Ms. Beckinsale might have just taken a less-than-worthy photograph for the cover).  Not was I only hooked, but this version became by far my favorite.<br /><br />For one thing, it is much truer to the book. It baffled me that the screenwriters of the Paltrow version had the chutzpah to think they could improve on Jane Austen.  This major flaw somehow slipped past me during my adaptation-induced euphoria and became apparent only after I watched the Paltrow film again after viewing the A&E, a film that remains wonderfully faithful to the book in every possible way.  And although much had to be cut, one never gets that sense of choppiness that inevitably comes with the adaptation territory.  There is genuine inventiveness involved in shortening the story; it moves quickly, but never feels rushed or cut up and pasted.<br /><br />Some of the characters in the Gwenyth Paltrow version at times seem either ill-cast or two-dimensional.  Jane Fairfax is supposed to be reserved but generally admired.  Emma doesn't like her, but that is simply because Emma is still maturing.  In the A&E version, you can see why Emma dislikes her: she's elegant, poised, musically skilled and yes, rather reserved, but there is nothing in her personality that would generally give cause to complaint.  Jane, in the Paltrow version, appears sneaky and suspicious in a very two-dimensional way, as if desperate to show the audience that she's hiding something.<br /><br />Harriet Smith is only slightly miscast in the Paltrow film but the actress's biggest problem here are the writers who felt the need to create gratuitously ridiculous scenes for her which added nothing but a few laughs.  How hysterical!:  Harriet is helping Emma minister to the poor and sick and she's freaking out so badly she's falling over!  Now she's posing for her portrait dressed in a ridiculous outfit and looking confused!<br /><br />Samantha Morton, A&E's Harriet, is exactly as I pictured her: attractive, innocent, naive and because these screenwriters had more respect for the book, she is always placed exactly where Austen meant her to be.<br /><br />Sophie Thompson is a wonderful actress and does a humorous, if somewhat two-dimensional portrayal of the chattery Miss Bates in the Paltrow version.  But just putting some spectacles on her face and tying up her hair in a bun can't hide the fact that she's much too young for the part.  The Paltrow version also erroneously shows her snubbing Emma after the infamously rude comment on Box Hill.  Miss Bates was much more gracious and forgiving than that, a fact well portrayed by the more accurate A&E version, whose Miss Bates is perfectly cast and who gives a wonderful performance.<br /><br />Who is the superior Emma?  My opinion is Kate Beckensale.  My husband, a Jane Austen fan by marriage, would vote for Paltrow.  Paltrow does bring a certain ditziness to the character which is very much in keeping with the book.  Beckensale comes off more sure of herself, but Emma was quite headstrong in her wrong-headness, so both potrayals are valid.<br /><br />One very nice touch, not in the book, mind you, but nice all the same is the ending: a supper/engagement party/dance at Mr. Knightly's.  All the major players are there and it wraps up the story perfectly.ltrow film but the actress's biggest problem here are the writers who felt the need to create gratuitously ridiculous scenes for her which added nothing but a few laughs.

B00000JTB2|5.0|This album tells the age old story of the old man and the boy. Or, more accurately, the gifted teacher and his brilliant student. The teacher knows the boy is better than he is (or ever was), but is not at all intimidated by that fact. He encourages the boy to reach his full potential and continue the blues tradition. The student has way too much respect and admiration to ever consider embarrassing his mentor, so he has to tone his playing down just a bit. The resulting balance is perfection -- Albert's thick, full Flying V leads intermixed with Stevie Ray's searing Stratocaster solos and plenty of great rhythm parts by both. If you like the electric guitar you MUST own this album. Play it LOUD and play it OFTEN!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|jet is amazing. they are the first rock group in over a decade to really go back to their roots. they show the influences of several of rock n roll's finest artists in each of their songs. also, they made a real album, not just a bunch of good hits. each song works together to make Get Born an album you can really get into like the who's tommy or the Beatles sgt. peppers. overal, they give hope to the future of rock and roll.

0790729636|4.0|Some movies are made as excused to play with special effects, which is a pretty good explanation for &quot;Twister.&quot;  This film was basically sold to the American public on the basis of two special effects shots in the trailer: a tornado demolishing a barn plank by plank and a tire heading right through a windshield at the camera.  The latter was not in the film, but that was beside the point.  In 1939 Arnold Gillespe used a stocking to terrify children for the rest of the century with the tornado in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;  In 1996 &quot;Twister&quot; intended to up the ante with computerized effects (of course there are lots of homages to the previous film, with &quot;Dorothy&quot; being the name of the tornado device that measures the wind speeds of the tornado and the cow blowing around in the air just like what Dorothy saw out her window when her twister lifted up the house).<br />Director Jan de Bont was making his second film after the smash hit &quot;Speed,&quot; so basically he needed some action.  But the script by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin decides to overload the script with melodramatic elements.  Helen Hunt plays Dr. JoAnne &quot;Jo&quot; Thorton-Harding, who has been chasing tornadoes ever since the night one of them took her daddy away.  Her scientific purpose is to study them so that meterologists can make more accurate predictions and warn people in time to save lives, but obviously she has deep psychological demons driving her as well.  This is one of the reasons that her husband, William Harding (Bill Paxton) is trying to get her to sign divorce papers.  He is hoping to build a new life with Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jamie Gertz), but being able to study tornadoes in peace without Jo going crazy would be nice too.  But if Helen Hunt wants to see what the inside of a tornado looks like, then that is what she should get to do.  Besides, even Melissa knows that Jo and Bill still love each other.<br />If this was not enough to give a whole new dimension to what is already an exciting proposition (these people want to chase tornadoes; what more do you need to get excited about in a movie?), the script sets up the &quot;good&quot; tornado chasers, including Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dustin Davis and Alan Ruck as Robert &quot;Rabbit&quot; Nurick, and the &quot;bad&quot; tornado chasers, led by Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), who is more interested in corporate sponsorship and television specials than in the holy grail of pure scientific research.  The &quot;bad&quot; guys even drive black vehicles in precision formations, while the &quot;good&quot; guys drive vehicles that each have to have at least 100,000 miles on them.<br />Consequently we have personal and professional circumstances that drive these people to put themselves in the path of oncoming hurricanes, which is, ultimately, the whole point of the movie.  &quot;Twister&quot; is not about a single hurricane, but several, all apparently different, with the biggest and baddest of them all, the Level 5 &quot;Finger of God,&quot; coming at the end.  You have to be impressed that not only our hero and heroine survive these tornadoes, but that the script manages to make it reasonable that their lives are imperiled repeatedly in this film.  That is what makes this a fun film, because even if the plot is on the level of a theme park ride, the special effects come fast and furious.  Just think Tornadoes 5 (three levels of meaning there, people), Plot 3, and &quot;Twister&quot; grades out at a 4.<br />Final Note: At some point in the past the ratings board decided that saying a movie was PG-13 was not enough information for warning parents.  The PG-13 rating for &quot;Twister&quot; is &quot;for intense depiction of very bad weather.&quot;  I leave you to ponder what a film would have to show in terms of bad weather to warrant an R rating (or higher).a whole new dimension to what is already an exciting proposition (these people want to chase tornadoes; what more do you need to get excited about in a movie?), the script sets up the &quot;good&quot; tornado chasers, including Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dustin Davis and Alan Ruck as Robert &quot;Rabbit&quot; Nurick, and the &quot;bad&quot; tornado chasers, led by Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), who is more interested in corporate sponsorship and television specials than in the holy grail of pure scientific research.

B000059ZLH|5.0|As a guitar player, I ordered this DVD for my son who is drummer. I decided to listen to it. What can I say. Petrucci, Portnoy, singer,,, keyboard.. are a perfect match. Singer adds a lot of punch to the song. Music is tight and high energy. One of the best DVD's I have heard so far. Worth every penny. Portnoy...what can you say !!! He ,along with the bass player drive like a transmission on a car. Superb. Hope to but another DVD soon. On a scale 1-10.... I give 15-18... way over the scale.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|&quot;Gothika&quot; is one of those movies that is not as bad as you heard that it was although certainly it has some major problems.  For one thing the movie tries so relentlessly to be eerie with all the spooky lighting and music that it threatens to be carried along by the style rather than the substance.  Then there is the fact that we know that in the &quot;real world&quot; a prison psychiatrist is not going to end up in the same prison where they practiced if the world decides that they are insane.  Doing so would mess up the treatment of every patient she had been working with, so we know that Halle Berry's Miranda Grey is there for a reason, which gets us thinking ahead of the plot and trying to figure out whodunnit.  Is director Mathieu Kassovitz being so heavy handed that he is obvious or is he skillfully setting up a red herring?  Good question.  You can answer it for yourself after you see the film.<br />Miranda is a psychiatrist in a dark and dreary prison where we are introduced to her as she is working with patient Chloe Sava (Penelope Cruz).  Miranda seems clinical and cool, if not cold.  One of the other staff psychiatrists, Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.) seems interested in her, but she has recently wed her boss, Dr. Douglas Grey (Charles S. Dutton).  That night, after taking a swim in the prison pool, she drives home during a thunderstorm and is forced to take a detour.  The figure of a ghostly girl appears in the middle of the road and Miranda crashes her car.  Miranda tries to help the girl, who looks like she has been the victim of something horrible, but then the girl bursts into flames.  The next thing Miranda knows she wakes up a prisoner in her own institution where she is told by Pete that she has been accused of brutally murdering her husband with an axe.  Miranda remembers nothing.<br />Chloe explains to Miranda that once you are declared to be officially insane anything you say will automatically be considered to be the ravings of a lunatic.  Miranda is put in the impossible position of convincing her captors that she is sane.  However, that is really not much of a problem because she is so distraught and confused that she convinces both herself and the viewers that maybe she is insane, and if that is true, then maybe it is true that she killed her husband.  Berry's performance bounces back and forth between screaming hysteria and a guarded detachment in an effort to survive everything that is being thrown at her by not only the authorities trying to convict her of murder but also of her own mind.  For those that thought Berry's Oscar for &quot;Monster's Ball&quot; did not prove she was a real actress, &quot;Gothika&quot; proves she is clearly more than a pretty face.<br />There is a paradox in this film, what some may consider a fatal flaw, in that in the final analysis all of the pieces do not fit.  Even once you know what is going on it does not really explain everything that is happening.  Watch the film a second time and you will see this is clearly the case.  However I think this was really more a question of keeping us guessing rather than having problems with story construction.  Kassovitz and screenwriter Sebastian Gutierrez are developing a sense of mystery and terror that literally extends to the end of the film where the final scene provides another piece of what is really an unfinished puzzle.  Listen to Kassovitz's commentary on this DVD and he will repeatedly talk about what they did to make individual scenes scary, without a clear regard for what it meant for the logic of the film.  Either you buy into the end result or this movie is going to grossly offend you.  There probably is not going to be any middle ground on this one.<br />Final Note: Kassovitz earns points by filming a group shower scene with Berry, Cruz, and over a dozen other women that is totally in keeping with the atmosphere of the film.  These women are all naked, but the scene is filmed in such a way that they arenot nude (that will make sense when you see it).  When that scene started I was mentally rolling my eyes at what I thought was going to be coming up next and Kassovitz simply did not go there.  That says something.are not nude (that will make sense when you see it).

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought Gavin's cd almost a year ago and it was by far the most interesting cd I've ever owned. I can put it on and no matter what mood I'm in, it always cheers me up. His songs all have a different beat to them and tell wonderful stories that you can actually relate to. Whether it's 'crush' about a crush that you may have or any of the other magnificent songs, Gavin DeGraw is definately the next Big Thing. He's not like all of those other pop singers out there, for his music is all written by him, with real emotion and feeling put into each and every lyric. I'd definately reccomend this cd if you are sick of listening to the same old reptition over and over again. Once you go GAVIN, you'll never go back! :)
B00005MP58|1.0|I am a little bit disappointed they omitted several tiny but important details in the original book. It should have been put into the screenwriting.<BR> <BR>1. In her first evening at Netherfield, Caroline Bingley was trying to get the attention of Darcy, to no avail. She finally asked Elizabeth to walk around the room, which prompted Darcy to unconsciously close the book he was reading, and looked up. This small detail is not in the movie.<BR> <BR>2. During her visit to Pemberley, it is not shown in the movie that Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner was shocked that Darcy gave so much attention to Elizabeth. They knew Elizabeth hated Darcy and they were told how evil he is, yet they are not surprised or suspicious enough that Darcy is so kind, gracious, and pay so much attention to her.<BR> <BR>I know this scene is very different from the book, because in the book it is what I will say a little bit unnatural. How can Elizabeth still managed to walk around the garden for a long time when Darcy suddenly appeared, is so unnatural. The movie version is much better and closer to real life.<BR> <BR>3. In the movie, it is very disappointing they ignore how Elizabeth informed her mother about Darcy's proposal. In the book it was outlined in great detail, I mean it's very long and special. Yet, in the movie suddenly after Elizabeth being questioned by her father about Darcy's proposal, we were given the scene at the wedding. And they show us the face of her mother, cold, unhappy (it looks like that to me). W<BR> <BR>What was her reaction? Did she realize that Darcy spent a fortune for her family without anyone knowing? That he was the one saving Lydia? All these details are ignored in the movie. Too bad.<BR> <BR>4. Casting is difficult, and critical too. Although in general I am very happy with the choice of the actors, I am disappointed with Mr. Wickham. He was supposed to be 28 years old, but in the movie he looks like 40 to me, and not handsome enough. In the book, Wickham is more handsome than Darcy.<BR> <BR>Even Colin Firth, playing Darcy, during shooting he was already 35, a little too old for a 28 years old. As for their acting, I cannot say anything but SUPERB. I love this movie.
