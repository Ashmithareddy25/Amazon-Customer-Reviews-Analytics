B002X3V4P2|5.0|Okay, she doesn't really &#34;rock&#34; in the sense of making that &#34;rock and roll&#34; music that the kids are so into these days. She doesn't use electric guitars and a pounding bass line. Nope. But she &#34;rocks&#34; in a more quiet and contemplative sense. Now you might argue that one can't exactly &#34;rock&#34; in a spiritual or meditative way but I say you can. Okay? Just sayin.
B00B769XB8|4.0|This movie put an interesting twist on a much beloved fairy tale.  The 3D version wasn't that amazing, but the story was interesting enough.  Take your classic Hansel and Gretel and turn them into ninja fighters with weapons and you have this take on the tale. The witches were well done and offered some graphic eye candy.  There was a love interest for Hansel and a little suprise at the end that differs from our classic story.  All in all I was entertained and would watch this again.
0385349947|5.0|I suggested this for my book club because I wanted us to have a conversation about it and I wanted to get past all the heated debate online that I had read.  Our book club was divided about who liked it - those who worked in male dominated fields (including me) liked it and those who didn't (teachers and psychologists) found the suggestions pretty strange or even counterproductive.  That was pretty interesting right there.<br /><br />As a scientist, I wish I could have read this book years ago - my career would be in a better place and I imagine I would feel less guilty about the spots where I can do better.  I am going to keep the book and reread it often so the lessons really sink in.  Oh, I think I should mention that I'm NOT someone who wants to give as much to my career as she has or become the CEO of anything.  She is a very driven woman but I value balance a bit more.  That said, the things she has learned as an über successful business woman translate well to lessons for me.<br /><br />I am also going to suggest my fiancé read it so he has a better understanding of what I and his female colleagues (in software/computer engineering) go through.
0553296981|4.0|This is the diary of a VERY young girl who had to go into hiding during Nazi Germany. What's interesting about this book is how you see Anne Frank evolve from an immature young girl into a young adult. I'm also grateful that the publishers put a prologue in about how her life ended. Because-the diary just ends....& unless you research it-you don't know what happens.
B000QUUD60|5.0|This is a great documentary of Elvis Life and all he went thru.<br />From Military to big concert's and come-backs until his life's end.<br />We Love & miss him!
B00C5WR6JE|4.0|As the title suggests, this album is a musical tribute to that most stunning part of the California coast. Located two hours south of San Francisco, Big Sur is a fabled place of natural beauty and bohemian inspiration. Before Bill Frisell, the area attracted writers like Hunter S. Thompson, Henry Miller and Jack Kerouac. In the same vein, all of the music on this album was written at the Glen Deven Ranch in Big Sur. With titles like 'Highway 1,' 'Hawks,' and 'A Beautiful View,' the songs sonically describe the place. Musically, the band plays Americana rock that is infused with Frisell's signature blend of jazz and chamber aesthetics. 'The Big One' even employs surf music. Songs like 'Sing Together Like a Family' and 'We All Love Neil Young' express a tender sense of nostalgia. On \\"Big Sur,\\" the mood is generally light. Indeed, it's been a long time since Frisell has done anything so upbeat. The Big Sur Quintet is filled with long-time Frisell veterans including Jenny Scheinman (violin), Eyvind Kang (viola), Hank Roberts (cello) and Rudy Royston (drums). Comparatively, this group's musical vision is most similar to sounds found on albums like \\"[[ASIN:B005F9CORS All We Are Saying...]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B006Z949UW Floratone II]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0029358HQ Disfarmer]].\\" Thus \\"Big Sur\\" sits comfortably among Bill Frisell's more accessible projects. Highlights include 'The Music of Glen Deven Ranch,' 'The Big One,' and 'Going to California' which is actually not the Led Zeppelin tune. Filled with originality and nuance, the cerebral performance is strong. Bill Frisell has been working on this incarnation of his sound for some time. For the artist, \\"Big Sur\\" may be the most magnificent expression of this beloved time period. With Frisell as your tour guide, take a drive on Highway 1. Let Bill Frisell guide you through one of the country's most scenic areas with an equally sublime soundtrack.
B005OSUKSA|5.0|I am very happy with my Garrett cd, and this is the first one that I ordered, but most of his cds are expensive,  so tjhis ws  good deal.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very challenging game.  Each level has any where from 3 to 7 puzzles to exit to next floor.  The difficulty could use a hint feature but that is only complaint.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|The film itself is great but this isn't a place to review the movie. Although the special features are a little small on this, you get a high def version of the film with the extended version included. Those interested in seeing the big ape in HD will highly enjoy this.
B0042ESTQW|5.0|Nifty little case.  It is thick enough and soft enough that it can do a pretty good job of protecting your Garmin 800.  I wouldn't want to use the Garmin without this protection.
0143038583|5.0|All I can say is that every American needs to read this book. In fact, every citizen of a first-world country needs to read this. What we eat is certainly something we think about every day, although some of us not as much so. This book will guide you to begin questioning the foods you eat based not only on their nutritional value, but also on their sustainability, ethical/moral issues, and their cultural significance. Please read this!
B009Y4JGFI|5.0|From opening to closing, this album keeps you moving. Each track is in the perfect spot and by the time you get to the end, it's sad that it's over.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I cannot compare the recent movie to the novel, but I will tell you that I enjoyed the novel quite a lot. The way Mitchell organized this novel is intriguing, though by the end you're looking so hard for connections that they loose a little of their &#34;gasp!&#34; appeal, but still I was so invested in the characters by then that I devoured the book faster and faster to see what would happen to them in the end. I was left wanting a little more, but I think that's what all good novels do. I would recommend this as a fun summer read.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|QOTSA managed to put out a great album that isn't a carbon copy of any of their previous ones. It gets better with every listen. I wish it was a little onger though...it's been so long since their last album!
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|If I had actually paid for this I'd fee ripped off. Cheesy sounds that correspond to a equally cheesy background. I have no idea why someone would want to use this.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|There is NO album like - this music is completely unprecedented !!  If you enjoy the excitement of live music and the exploration of sound mixed with a classical flavor - you will LOVE YANNI !!!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Great series, glad it can finally all be found in one place! 10/10 would recommend to any Daria fans out there.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I Love games like this. I also like Nemo. A great game for the kids. In my opinion, no flaws... except for the fact that it starts you off with 10 pearls. I Love to use the Extraordinary Mystery Seed. That costs 10 pearls.
B0076HM3ZA|4.0|After \\"Blue Velvet\\" David Lynch was still exploring the rotten underbelly of small town America.  The pilot could lead almost anywhere and the murderer could be almost anybody.  But Lynch took too much advantage of having hours to unravel this mystery.  No matter how good his dialogue or cinematography was, by 2013 audiences lose interest if the pace stays at a crawl.  I already know what a small town looks and feels like.  Editing 10 or 20% of the bland stuff out would improve it.  But it's better than most tv then or now.
B001F12J0C|5.0|very good movies Matt Damon is a great actor in these movies I would recommend them for anyone who likes action
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Disney is finally starting to learn that high speed action and manic dialogue are inferior to just having good ideas to start with.  Granted, those ideas are all impossible but you gladly go along with it just for fun.  I only subtract a star because the floating house voyage and the final blimp battle were the most visually interesting scenes, yet they took up less time than the endless dog chases. The old man should have brought his own clever dog.
B007QXU0ZO|2.0|Again I found all but the first two songs BORING AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF I COULD HAVE LISTNED TO A BIT OF EACH SONG BEFOR BUYING THE ENTIRE CD
0670026603|5.0|Although this book is about a person who wishes to die, it is actually a book about life.<br />The story shows how bringing others happiness can actually make you happy and how life<br />is something to be lived - not just watched.  I am a neuro nurse who also works with<br />caregivers - and thought this book did a great job of describing how difficult it is to<br /> live in this world with disabilities. Still, it was an uplifting book.  Quick enjoyable<br /> read.
B002AOWXQ8|2.0|The songs were to boring except for &#34;home&#34; and I expected more upbeat music.  I would have liked the option to buy only song.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Granted, this is a surprisingly funny and uplifting story, considering it centers around two teenagers with cancer who meet in a support group and fall in love. And there were numerous times I laughed out loud. It is so smartly written, making you think about things just a little while thoroughly entertaining you the entire way. But it is also the only book I can ever remember that made me sob out loud, uncontrollably, and more than once. (Thank God I was alone.) Of course, part of it is that the lead boy's name is Gus, same as my 5-year old, who is blessedly healthy... something I am emphatically more grateful for after reading this gem of a novel. But it is also so honest and raw and beautiful and gut-wrenching and inspiring and yes, very, very funny. It is technically considered a Young Adult novel, and all I can say is we are so lucky to have authors like John Green writing such exquisite books for our children to read. But make no mistake, this book is for any lover of literature.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Cool game would recommend it for the kids to pass time time when travelling<br />Keeps then busy and the game goes on forever
B003HARV3Y|4.0|My students watched the movie after reading the book. They really liked the movie even though it was different from the book. I liked the movie but I liked the book more. It will be a good series if they decide to finish it!
B00BC24NT4|3.0|This is a ponderous and predictable tale sprinkled with polemics. Unless you're a devoted le Carre fan it will require commitment to complete. Keep a British-English dictionary handy.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Everything in the store is way to expensive, but on the ios version of the same game its cheaper, that's bs like the same armour on a ipod is less than it is on here, way too expensive game loft, other than that bs its an awsome iron man game
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|The only negative I can say is that I need to install drivers for this to work. it isn't plug and play. But other then that I have had no problems with it. Over USB3 it is gigabit and it meets what I was looking for. A USB 3 LAN adapter with a sleek look.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|What a great deal buying this collection of Cd's instead of purchasing each individually. Sound quality is excellent! Great Deal!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is a really great movie have watched it a couple times!!!<br />Have not been upset purchasing this movie at all.
B00B6OEDS4|4.0|This artist has a nice mellow voice. She sounds much like the artist Sade. A bit of mellow type jazz influence.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this one the best. there are many versions but I was really pleased CAN YOU ESCAPE is not overloaded with commercials or ads. theres no interruptions of ads.. I consider this a big deal with a lot of the free games. fun for you if you have an hour to waste.. :)
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I didn't realize this was a teenager book when I purchased for my Kindle.  Story line was ok, but dialogue was unrealistic for teenagers.  The author invented a lot of terms and then assumed you knew what they were without explaining what they meant. Overall a dece read but a bit slow.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|AWESOME JOB SUZANNE COLLINS!<br />Amazing books.<br />READ These BOOKS<br />Honestly WAY better then the movie<br />You should read it so READ IT
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I haven't got bored with this yet. usually after awhile there all the same but its challenging enough so you won't get bored . plus it's free what can be better.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Worthwhile documentary. This gives a good overview of the food system in North America - if you are already aware of most of these issues its a good documentary to watch with someone who is perhaps less aware. If not I highly recommend.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I use this on my kindle fire when traveling so I can keep in touch with everyone I speak to
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I have now purchased two of these products - one as a gift. They work well and take a little getting used to. Once you practice on a few bottles you will get it down.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|When I first started to read this book I couldn't put it down, because of how amazing the story line was.
0345529057|5.0|These books are awesome, even better than the show. If you like fantasy at all, these are definitely for you.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Florida Georgia Line is awesome! The rest of the cd is as good as their singles! I highly recommend it to any country fan or anyone who just started listening to country music!

B000IU3XTW|5.0|As a superfan of the Foo Fighters and a lover of the acoustic genre, I love this album! And Dave Grohl's voice is amazing. He is a talented musician, but his talents are demontrated in this album like never before. This is a must-have album for any true Foo Fighter fan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game and everyone has to play it well not everyone but it is a good game.
B0000CAXID|5.0|The Foo Fighters are amazing. Thank God, if not for anything else, thank God for Dave Grohl coming out on his own to give us the Foo Fighters. This first album is wonderful, and I was ecstatic to hear it. I LOVE this album!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just started playing this game today and I love it. It's not too hard but not too easy either. It makes you think and has no technical problems so far.
0062082353|5.0|This was a very interesting read. I would recommend this book to anyone. I am sharing the book now with a friend.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie is hysterical. I loved it. It's Romeo and Juliette with zombies.... (I can't tell you the difference besides zombies though with out spoiling the ending.) :-) ENJOY!!!!!!!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|This download made it extremely easy to locate files on my kindle fire hd. I would reccommend getting this download.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Love this show!!!!! Like it even better without the commercials, that's one of the reasons to buy the CDs. Great show!!!! From the serious side to the funny side this is the complete package!!!!! Can't wait for Season 3 to start!!!!!!!
B00DF0POXA|1.0|This could possibly the worst album I have ever listened to in my entire life. How people are giving this thing anything other than 1 or 2 stars is beyond me. I am guessing they are just Kanye fans with blind loyalty because there is nothing on this album that is even a slight step above hot garbage. The beats are all complete experiments gone wrong and the lyrics are less than appealing. I would not recommend this album to anyone and the music industry would be better off if nobody purchased it.
0061733199|5.0|This is the final authority on survival in almost any situation. This is also available as an app but hey, when the cell towers go down you are left with nothing. Get this as a back up for the worst situations.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I really enjoy the Good Wife series. Looking forward to the new season starting up. I started watching the series on Amazon and now I am up to speed for the new season. :D
0061900656|5.0|Toddler son lives this book. Quotes parts of it while we re taking care of his infant sister. Fun to read and cuddle with the little man.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good way to teach kids responsibilities and if you are debating whether or not to get a horse you can just use the game to see
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Fun book to read, I know the movie will be coming out soon and I can't wait to compare the two
B006YB9VJU|5.0|the items is amazing perfect  cool i love it thank you very much i will give 5 star for that thanks , thank you very much
B009NY43NY|1.0|Ok, maybe I exaggerate. But I have waited SO LONG. Perhaps it would be ok if this wasn't the last book... but it is. I don't know what to do. This. Is. HORRIBLE.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Watching this movie reminded me of my childhood .and my children as little kids. It brought back so many memories Love it
B0091HVMVO|2.0|The remastering was short of a disaster. For example, the Beetoven Violin Concerto the violin sounds anything like a violin and the orchestra sounds like it was recorded through a can.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Although I absolutely love [[ASIN:B001OMJGD0 Superman Returns]], I realize now that doing it the way they did (Staying true to the feel of the 1978 Classic) would not be enjoyed by a modern movie-going audience. Now, seven years removed from the previous attempt to reignite the Superman franchise, Producer Christopher Nolan, Director of the acclaimed [[ASIN:B009JBZH54 The Dark Knight Trilogy (Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / The Dark Knight Rises) [Blu-ray]]]), teams up with \\"Batman Begins\\" screenwriter David S. Goyer, and Director Zack Snyder ([[ASIN:B002EDH0FE Watchmen]], [[ASIN:B000V39KDO 300]]) to reboot the Superman saga for a modern audience. And overall, their effort, \\"Man of Steel,\\" delivers on the promise of making Superman accessible to a modern audience.<br /><br />The major problem the film has is, unlike \\"Superman Returns,\\" where the focus was on character and story, at the expense of action and spectacle, \\"Man of Steel\\" is the exact opposite, focusing on action and spectacle, at the expense of character and story. The filmmakers seemed to be working hard at making a \\"Batman Begins\\" version of a Superman film, which sadly does not entirely work. While the action and visual effects are awesome to behold, it turns out that there are just too many action sequences. And as a result, there is a good lack of character development and story. For me, I'm still trying to decide if I like actors in certain roles. Henry Cavill as Kal-el/Clark Kent/Superman is one of those I'm still trying to figure out. I'll admit, he does great with what character moments he has. But when we are thrust into action sequence after action sequence, it becomes hard to focus squarely on the characters. This movie could definitely have used either ten minutes less action and spectacle, or ten minutes more character and story, to help balance out the epic story that Nolan, Goyer and Snyder were attempting to tell.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, the movie still comes out as good. Although there are too many of them, the action is definitely exciting and, in some cases, unlike anything seen so far on film. And there are a number of good performances in the bunch. Michael Shannon surprisingly does a great job as General Zod, the main villain of the piece. While nobody could match Terence Stamp from the first two films, he does a great job of making Zod both villainous, but also understandable. Amy Adams is really good as Lois Lane. And although they are not in it all that long, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane do a fine job as Jonathan and Martha Kent, the human parents of Superman, who instill their adopted son with a strong moral core. But to me, the highlight of the cast was Russell Crowe as Jor-el, Superman's Kryptonian father. He gives the film a truly iconic screen presence, similar to what Marlon Brando did with [[ASIN:B0012QVJXS Superman: The Movie]]. His gravitas gives the film a good emotional jolt, and his scenes are truly memorable. Christopher Meloni, Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Richard Schiff also turn in great performances.<br /><br />Another fantastic element of the film is Hans Zimmer's remarkable score. While not as memorable as John Williams' classic, it is still a truly remarkable addition to the film, adding additional excitement and emotion to the story. Zimmer is definitely a force to be reckoned with when it comes to film scores, and his work for \\"Man of Steel\\" is definitely destined to be another classic work of his. In particular, the scene where Clark flies for the first time in the suit is truly exciting and awe-inspiring, even more so with Zimmer's music playing over it. This helped to make that scene the best in the film.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Man of Steel\\" is a good-but-not-great return for Superman to the big screen. Despite having too much action and spectacle, some strong performances and a great Hans Zimmer score make up for the weaknesses in the story. If you are a fan of Superman and comic book/superhero/action-adventure films, then \\"Man of Steel\\" is one you're sure to enjoy.<br /><br />Grade: B+ion-adventure films, then \\"Man of Steel\\" is one you're sure to enjoy.<br /><br />Grade: B+
B00133KHCY|5.0|This was a great gift at a great price for my father.  He loves the movie and has it on DVD to loan out to those with DVD players and now he has the Blu-ray player to review or loan to others when they have a Blu-ray player.  This was what he asked for his birthday.<br /><br />The product arrived on time and in good condition with no damage or incident during the ordering and shipping process.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I love older Killers stuff, but thought this was a great new album with many hints of older music. A good listen!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This is one of the finest boards available, if you get the latest revision which in this case is 3.0 but this board I just received is a 1.1. So I sent it back to Amazon.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|There is no warning that you cannot play this on a regular blurry player especially when you pre ordered in April it said bluray3d, bluray3d, did and digital copy. It's a total lie. Inside there is an offer to enter a code and get the bluray disk for 5.99 this is a total scam I will never buy another Disney movie again
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I very much enjoy Sylvia's books.  Looking forward to next one!!!!! I'm sure it will be as good as the rest.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|A really Great book.  It is easy to read.<br />I would absolutely recommend it to all!!<br />I am from Aruba and I have to say the way I raise my Aruba-American kids is similar to this author.  I wish i had the money and the time to do more i.e music lessons etc.  But I have to say there is nothing wrong with expecting more from your kids than what the American society expects from them!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm not one to write reviews, as a matter of fact I think this is my first. I'm a book worm and love these romance novels. But this is by far the most disappointing book I have read in a long time. I kept waiting for something to happen, either good or bad. Eva and Gideon keep allowing people to intrude in their lives and everything is more important than their relationship. I get that their relationship is somewhat dysfunctional but come on!! there is so much you can allow, and everything can not be solved with mind-blowing sex. I felt like the author stretched out just to make another book. I was also surprised to find out there are two more books, really? I don't think I will be buying the next two. Farewell to Eva and Gideon, I hope they can be happy some day!!
B005J0VPNC|2.0|This app was working fine until I changed my phone to Samsung Galaxy S4.  Now, it's VERY grainy and pictures look really bad compared to the previously created ones on my previous phone.  Looks like Google Play Store has newer v3.4.3.  From its \\"What's new\\" section, it \\"Fixed several problems on the Galaxy S4\\".<br /><br />I want to update to v3.4.3.  When Amazon gets this update?
0920668372|5.0|I bought this book for a gal that is having a baby. I read it when it first came out. There was a room of us teachers at a daycare. Not a dry eye after the book was read. Bought one and gave it to my son. It is one I would recommend very highly. Such a special book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I couldn't get myself away from this game once I got it!I love it soooo much ! It has better graphics than any other games I know
B008FSCNTK|3.0|Her Glad Rag Doll concert was fabulous and I have tremendous respect for Ms. Krall.<br /><br />I just personally don't enjoy most of the songs on this album ... but I'm glad that artistic freedom still lives.<br /><br />My favorites are Glad Rag Doll, Prarie Lullaby and Wide River To Cross.  The rest of the album I could do without.  Wish she had chosen her songs more wisely or at least stayed with a theme.  One can get whiplash from the tempo/mood changes.<br /><br />I will always and forever be a fan of the lovely, talented, intelligent and funny Diana Krall.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I would if I could! I just discovered this wonderful album, and I'm totally mesmerized. It is near perfect, I am in awe of Dido's songwriting. I love every song, though I sometimes skip \\"Thank You\\" because I have heard it so much on the radio. Words cannot describe the exquisiteness of the tracks here, like \\"Isobel\\" or \\"Take My Hand\\", you really must listen for yourself. Best of all is that it is one of those records with great flow, and a real sense of cohesion.<br /><br />highly recommended, enjoy!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is just plain well done. Creepy as hell, great characters. Another great family program (at least for my family).
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was able to take my completed file, format it properly, save it, and upload it in under two hours. Now, OWN BIG RED is a reality, and I am a published author. Other books have more complicated instructions, and instruct you to use MOBIPOCKET to make your book Kindle-compatible. Well, first, it doesn't work, and second, you don't need to, now that you can upload your book in HTML format. SOOO much easier. Excellent resource, will continue to use this as my standard reference.
B005F9TQBU|5.0|Santana's fourth album, Caravanserai released in October 1972, marked a change in styles as well as a line up change during the sessions. This album saw Tom Coster joining the band as well as the last with Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon as part of the band. The band had always had a jazzy side and this album was the first to explore that more in depth. A fantastic album!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I can access folders read from multiple accounts, pretty much everything I can do on Yahoo's web interface. I think this is an excellent app. It delivers exactly what it promises. Kudos.
B001CNFZEK|5.0|Santana's third album marks the addition of Neal Schon and would also be the last from the band's first album line up. The band would change members and go into a more jazz filled direction after this. While I don't like this one quite as much as Abraxas, it's still great and has a few tunes that were all over FM radio back in the '70's. The version I'm reviewing here is the Legacy edition which comes with a second disc containing the band's last concert at the Fillmore West on July 4th, 1971 which is a fantastic performance and features a burning performance of In A Silent Way which appeared on Fillmore: The Last Days. In fact, this is the show that those performances come from.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This was fantastic to watch in 3D, I have the Lord of the Rings trilogy, read the books watched the movies, I also read the Hobbit and now to see it as a movie was fantastic, it is brilliant and shot over the trench again with stunning scenery and brilliant graphics, I cannot wait for the second installment, the only gripe I had really was that it was on two DVD's for the 3D movie but that is the price you pay if you want to watch it in 3D.
B0000062FL|5.0|Santana's second album, first released in September 1970, may be the band's best studio effort in my opinion. While the first record is a great debut, this is the one where everything hits perfection. Opening with the cool instrumental Singing Winds, Crying Beasts before dropping us into a classic cover of Fleetwood Mac's Black Magic Woman. There is not a bad note on here and most of the songs are standards in the band is still known by. The album is a classic mixture of Latin rock mixed in with jazz leanings. A stellar release and a must own!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found this a little slow in the beginning but it turned into a book I couldn't put down. Very interesting
B0000027D5|5.0|I really love the Caravanserai/Welcome jazz era of Santana so it's no surprise that this is right up my alley. Recorded over two shows in Japan from July 1973, the album features some of the band's most exploratory work. This is the line up that recorded Welcome. The album contains absolutely BURNING versions of songs like Every Step Of The Way, Incident at Neshabur, and Toussaint L'Overture among the rest. If you like shorter more traditional songs, you might want to look elsewhere. If you like longer jammed out jazzy stuff, this is the place. One of the best albums Santana ever released.

0345803485|2.0|I really didnt enjoy reading this. The story is unbelievably boring and not as entertaining as my girl friends said it'd be.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Get it. You really can't go wrong with James Patterson books or movies. I have been reading them for years  andhave not been disappointed yet.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very fun and addicting. I had a great time playing it. But at first it was a little confusing how the game is set up, but it's a good thing that this game has a person to guide you through the game.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Emeli has a way of building on the foundation of soul and gospel that brings an undeniable ring of truth to her melodies and lyrics. Music for your every day and for your more reflective moments as well
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have not read a book in years and when my wife let me use here Kindle Fire I choose the Fifty Shades Trilogy. Let me tell you that I could not put the book down.  I would recommend this store for anyone who loves a great story with twist and turns not knowing what's next.  I would love to see the next Trilogy E L James puts out! This one is going to be tough to beat!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Full, basic functionality.  Looks and acts like the real thing without any crazy add-ons.  Easy to use.  Experienced no problems.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|It's been a while since I've read this series, but a recent sale made me revisit the book.  Very engaging characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game wad kind of fun. Though I did get stuck on level seven before I managed to figure out how to escape. I will admit that I did go looking for a feat app, but when I didn't find one I went back and tried to advance again. I will say that it really does need more levels, very short game that only took me about half an hour to finish those eight levels.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|If you like Youtube there's plenty of clips and music video's you most likely want to download to a mobile device, especially a Tablet. While on a computer you can download relatively easily not so with Android unless you have an App like TubeMate. It works almost flawlessly, and it's simple to use. Just surf Youtube from within this app, start playing the video and if you want it, simply hit the green arrow. You can predetermine where to have it downloaded, and seems most any video player will play it. (I highly recommend MX player if you are not going to use whatever built in player you have)<br />It also lets you pick what resolution to download at, depending of course how high the resolution was originally recorded in.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Enjoyable read, looking forward to the next book in the series. Wish it would come out sooner then latter. I sense there is more on the story, hoping for a great ending.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|Boy am I late to the party! As you probably know, Amazon groups ALL reviews of a film together, whether it is DVD, Bluray, 3D or the theater version. So, even though the home video version wasn't released until June 11th, there are already 527 reviews here before this one! I'm sure you don't have time in your life to read them all and I'll try to make mine productive. As I remind those who read my reviews, it is often best to sort by date (choose \\"most recent\\") to separate a home video review from a theater version. And you can see which version of the home video the reviewer is referring to. This is of the BD/DVD combo pack.<br /><br />As for the film, I have to say I \\"liked\\" it but didn't love it. As you will learn from the best \\"Bonus feature\\" - \\"Walt Disney and the Road to Oz\\", a new 10-minute documentary- which DOES appear on the single DVD version as well as the Blu-ray, Disney wanted make a film music of the Oz books since the 1930s and even bought the rights to some of them. He was fascinated with the idea. (I won't tell you more - it would spoil the fun). The new folks at Disney went way too far with CGI effects for me and you can easily see the scenes they included for the 3D effect in that version.<br />Like the Broadway musical \\"Wicked\\" - which I'll be seeing on stage next week for the third time! - OTG&P is a prequel to the famous 1939 Judy Garland vehicle. And it drops hints of what is to come. And like most Disney films, the main character, Oz (James Franco) has an animal companion (a monkey this time) who cracks jokes. This is not a kids' picture per se though they will like the color and special effects. I think it's worth watching but it won't be a Disney \\"Classic\\".<br />Now for the bonuses:<br /><br />The DVD has the aforementioned \\"Walt Disney and...\\" plus five minutes of bloopers<br />The BD has the above plus a 21 minute \\"My Journey in Oz\\" film which Franco filmed, directed and narrates. (It's more of a vanity project IMHO)<br /><br />There a 5 minute feature on the \\"china Girl\\", 11 minutes on design and effects, 7-minutes on makeup design, and 7 minutes about the music score from Danny Elfman.<br />So, lots of bonuses for those who want the story behind the \\"magic\\" on the screen.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"minute feature on the \\"china Girl\\", 11 minutes on design and effects, 7-minutes on makeup design, and 7 minutes about the music score from Danny Elfman.<br />So, lots of bonuses for those who want the story behind the \\"magic\\" on the screen.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Puzzles were challenging without being so hard that u want to throw ur electronic device. cant wait for more levels. Love it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of crime mysteries, but I was looking for a good read and Amazon recommended this. I'm glad they did. This was a book I struggled to put down almost from the minute I picked it up.<br /><br />The story alternates between grand jury testimony given by the main character, Andy Barber, and Andy's first-person narrative of the events surrounding his son Jacob being accused of a classmate's murder. The technique works, and little breadcrumbs are dropped throughout both the transcript and the narrative, hinting that things don't end well. As in real life, there are a multitude of ways in which things can end poorly, and I did not see this particular ending coming.<br /><br />Sometimes in a book, the reason you didn't predict the ending is that it's utterly implausible based on what you've been told about the situation and the characters. In this case, however, the ending manages both to surprise and to make perfect sense.<br /><br />The characters are pretty well-drawn, although the narrator expresses a little more insight into what others think and feel than one would expect him to have. I suppose that's a danger in a first-person narrative; if the narrator can't tell us about certain things, it's hard for us to know them. This was a minor flaw in the book as far as I was concerned, and it didn't affect my enjoyment of it.<br /><br />Mr. Landay is a good storyteller, and a master at using language--you get caught up in the story, not the language being used to tell it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would recommend this Bible for students who would like to control the way that they study the Bible. They can personalize the system of studying and save it to share or go over it again.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Easy and fun!!  Glad to have this feature! This is a great idea and happy to be able to use it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My dad says that I spend to much time playing this games but I cant take my eyes of the screen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A376BB2|5.0|An awful lot of misconceptions and false beliefs appeared around relational database theory and RDBMSes almost as soon as the technology itself arrived in the late '70s. People patiently explained and demonstrated why those ideas were wrong then. And they did the same in the '80s. And in the '90s. Unfortunately, those bad ideas are still common today.<br /><br />Every day, it seems like, you get self-appointed experts asserting that &#34;indexes slow you down&#34;, or &#34;going past second normal form is unnecessary and bad for performance&#34;, or &#34;we don't need a primary key on this table&#34;, and on and on. (My favorite piece of wrong-headedness, for an OLTP system: &#34;we shouldn't use transactions--we can just do a filesystem sync() after each update.&#34; Almost beautiful, in its many layers of wrongness.)  The fact that a lot of very smart people have thought long and hard about these issues, have measured the alternatives, and have come to different conclusions, never seems to occur to these blow-hards.<br /><br />In the '70s, '80s, and early-to-mid '90s, project cycle times were much longer than they are now, so it was easier to give new developers one-on-one tuition in the elements of DBMS usage--which is what we're talking about here. Since the Web took off, though, everyone's been too busy doing things to learn how to do them.<br /><br />We sorely needed someone to take the essence of that old-time one-on-one tuition, write it down, and publish it. And now, Bill has.<br /><br />He did it well, too. The tone of the book is just right, that of a tutor rather than an expert pontificating from on high. The language is plain and direct. The content is all essential. The information density is high, and Bill points you in the direction of further information when appropriate.<br /><br />Study this book, and believe what Bill says. He's not writing from his own experience only, but giving you the hard-won wisdom of generations of database architects, administrators, and developers.  If you are a project leader, make up a test sheet with examples of the anti-patterns on it, and don't let anyone develop for you, unless they can fix at least 20 out of the 25.<br /><br />The book is that good, and the advice that fundamental.<br /><br />Quibbles.  Of course, there has to be something - the 'architect' personality type guarantees it. :-)<br /><br />While I recognize the constraints imposed by the publishing process, and the attraction of marketing by buzzword, I found the format of the book confining.<br /><br />There are four sections, covering logical database design, physical design, queries, and application design, each with between three and eight chapters. Each chapter follows a set pattern: a problem; a common obvious-but-wrong solution, the anti-pattern; clues (for onlookers, I guess) that the anti-pattern is being used; what to do instead.  Bill knows his material, he writes well, and the organization and sequencing is logical, but at times the rigid format makes the treatment a little awkward or cursory.<br /><br />There are two anti-patterns that really should be front and center. But they're buried near the back, numbers 20 and 21 (out of 25). I'm talking, of course, about SQL Injection and Storing Readable Passwords.<br /><br />In terms of risk, these have to be by far the most egregious anti-patterns, and they deserve maximum prominence for that reason. But the &#34;functional&#34; readers among us are likely to miss those two chapters, simply because of where they are--and those are the people who really need to read them, for all our sakes. The book's concept, unfortunately, fixes those topics where they appear.<br /><br />Another quibble is with the (non)treatment of database roles, privileges, and schemas.  Bill touches on these matters briefly in some chapters, but they deserve more attention. Risk optimisation requires defense in depth, and these are some of the key tools. Unfortunately, they are rarely discussed, let alone discussed systematically, in RDBMS or SQL books.  I was hoping for some discussion from Bill, but it wasn't to be. This is where the format of the book is most irritating: because there's no anti-pattern--these things are not done badly, they're not done at all--it's hard to give database security its own chapter.<br /><br />There are many, many other omitted topics, of course. Relational theory and the use of RDBMSes are big enough subjects to require at least nine months' study for competence, a few years' study for skill, and longer still for mastery.  This book is aimed at those in months six to nine, perhaps. But security is so important these days that its omission (as a whole topic) pains me. I hope we get something in Volume II.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I say the first book was better but overall it was pretty good<br />I can't wait to read the  third book though
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|This album had the strangest effect on me out of any of their previous efforts.<br /><br />Is This It? obviously was love at first listen. Room on Fire had 5 or 6 track that stood out while the remainder grew over time. Ditto for First Impressions (I think You Only Live Once is still their best track period). Angles grew on me over time. It took a while.<br /><br />My experience on Comedown Machine was bizarre to say the least. My first listen through I wasn't sure I liked any of it. Then my second listen something changed. By the time I finished my second listen I was hands down convinced this the the best thing they have done yet. That has never happened to me with any album. I either love it, it grows on me, or I hate it. Comedown Machine really changed the way I receive the music of The Strokes.  I have now listened to the album no less than 20 times and it gets better with each go around.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Great Gift for someone . make for a great Chirstmas Gift or Birthday Gift . The Fifth Season leave you wanting more and more!!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|If you like dragons and enjoy world-building games, you'll love Dragon Story. As you feed your dragon, it will go through 10 levels of growth and 4 stages of evolution, from adorable little baby dragon all the way to awesome epic dragon. You can purchase them as eggs, or breed them yourself, crossing breeds to get new ones. Visit neighbors, play with their dragons, fill your island with dragon habitats, and expand your dragon world; there's so much to do, it's hard to leave this game alone.<br /><br />DRAWBACKS: If you play on a Kindle, be aware that the program is not as fully developed as it is for other platforms. There are items & dragons not available to Kindle players, and visiting neighbors who play on certain platforms will cause your game to stop, which can be annoying. There appears to be some bugs with the game for Kindle that the developers need to work out, including crashes at high levels causing loss of all progress in game, so beware spending any money on purchasing gold. Since neighbors gift gold to you, with patience, all items can be purchased without spending real money.<br /><br />Aside from those issues, the game is great fun.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Fun group of songs!!!!<br />To me, this is the black keys best CD.<br />Every song is strong and, simply, fun to listen to.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Top notch fantasy, very well done.  My only complaint is that it would have a wider audience if they would tone down the sex and violence.  Overall very well done.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I highly recommend it. Very, very funny! We really enjoyed watching it. My only regret is that we didn't order the other seasons at the same time.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I Recieved this watch about a week ago.  When I pulled it out of the box I was slightly disapointed with the size of the watch itself and actually thought about sending it back.  I figured i would give it a couple days to give it a chance.  Its been a full week now and the watch has yet to leave my wrist.  Although i did replace the band that came with it (due to it being very thin and femenin looking).  After i replaced the band with the 20mm &#34;the band&#34; strap it made the watch look better.  As far as performance of the watch goes, I couldnt be happier.  It keeps outstanding time and is very quick and simple to read.  The automatic movement is awesome.  The deciding factor for me buying the watch was the automatic movement and the fact that the watch displays the date AND the day of the week.  One thing i didnt expect was the fact that this little watch is incredibly tough.  My second day owning it I scraped it against a concrete barrier. I looked down in terror thinking my brand new watch was going to need a new face within 48 hours of recieving it.  But where i expected there to be a deep gash there was a prestine crystal in mint condition.  All in all a great little watch.  the only reason i gave it a four star review is the size of the face but that is very minute in comparison to the performance of the watch itself.  Hope this was helpful
B000W91RUG|5.0|We watched it within a few days. The laughter never stopped. Couldn't wait to watch the next season. We just ordered two more seasons. I'm sure we will love those just as much.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Much like the 1 & 2 star reviews I just read,  I was rather let down with the book. Not to mention annoyed at the poor attempts to bring unnecessary twists into a storyline in an effort to squeeze out more books from a story  that was originally intended to be a trilogy. What happened to ending something on a high note?!?!By book five this series will be remembered as a drawn out story with one sex scene after another while lacking any meaningful substance. Greed at its finest!  What's sucks for me (the reader), is that I became attached to the characters.  I liked the bond between Eva and Gideon. Rooted for their relationship, and was eager to read the ending. Whether I'll stay patient and see this love story through to the end remains to be seen. Perhaps my curiosity will get best of me. But  considering my disappointment, I have an inkling that by the time the next installment is out, my fascination with these characters will long be gone.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Ever since I got the cord I have been able to download the pictures and songs to my kindle tablet with no problem. Can't wait to use it when I transfer movies from my computer to the kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed the game. Only problem I found was I wished there were more levels took part. However the levels available were really fun.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put it down. One of the best reads I read in a long time. Great job Hugh Howey!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It was amazing!!! Very detailed and very interesting. I thought is was one of the best books I have ever read
B000FBJAEG|5.0|A good read, even tho the practical mind tells you the end is WAY too convoluted to be believable.  Likable main characters.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Great story!!!  Great performance!!!  Her story should be mandatory reading or viewing in every school.  A great lesson in overcoming adversity.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I learned so much I had no idea I didn't know before. Very well done. Very moving as well. The thoughts and feelings of all kinds of people make the history live.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really love this app for my kindle fire!! it is really fun!!! hope whoever teas this is convinced to buy the app!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|A good way to spend a few minutes before a doctor visit. I use it to go to sleep. Great but I hate the adds.
B00992CF6W|1.0|who the heck would play a game that is 7 bucks??!!! NOT ME!!! out of all the games in the appstore people want to buy the most expensive one!!!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I had it for like 30 seconds and i already didn't like it. Back to the long way:/ (internet Google)
1455523003|5.0|A myth exposed.<br />Christopher Hitchens a militant atheist at his best.<br />I thought the book really well documented and written.
B00594XOZU|4.0|It's great! But....<br /><br />I don't like that you can't log out. The only way to do that is to log onto your kik on a different device. If you don't have one, you can't log out.<br /><br />Also, i wish you could search people by their names, not just their usernames. Because sometimes you don't know their username so it's hard to find them.<br /><br />Fix these and it'd be so much more helpful.
B006LSZECO|5.0|At first, this book didn't pull me in, but after few chapters, I read the rest in a day. It realy has unbeliavable twist and turns, even after you think there can be no more...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is and when I was reading it was amazing. How Suzanne Collins wrote it was such amazing that she could make the reader felt as if they were in Panem. I would recommend this book to all my friends but they have read it!! You should read it!!!!!
B0067R0APK|4.0|For a paid app it is OK. Hard to refresh and reader only works about half the time. But the weather reporting is accurate.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|This game looked like a lot of fun, but I've had nothing but problems with the servers. It often won't connect, and then signs me out of gameloft. Kindle fire HD.
B0058VW36U|5.0|i love this is the bset game ever its so easy and fun i love this game its cool and awesome its just the WOW!
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I saw Papa Roach on \\"Guitar Center Presents\\" and was totally wowed by their tightness, energy and power.  So I went to Amazon and found I could buy MP3 version of this release for $5.  I downloaded it and started listening.  After the first time through I listened to it 2 or 3 times a day for a couple of weeks and never got tired of it.  I still pick it up when I need a lift and it always satisfies.  I have since bought a bunch of their older stuff and still like this one the best.  Jacoby uses his adventures in life to produce lyrics that touch me and the rest of them are AMAZING musicians.<br /><br />I'm more of a Progressive and Symphonic Metal person so I have high standards for musicianship.  Everybody in this band can really play and sing.  They are pretty much a \\"One-trick Pony\\" but they are so good at what they do I am never disappointed.  I never liked \\"Rap Rock\\" but this is so more than talking over music.  I'm OK with talking at points in the song if it feels right and in Papa Roach it always does.<br /><br />Addendum - Still loving this album and I will also recommend \\"The Paramour Sessions\\" and \\"Time for Annihilation\\".  Paramour is another album with a great songs and performance and Time has five excellent new songs and live killer versions of their biggest singles.<br /><br />Addendum - October - Still listen to this album 3-4 times a week.  It's one of the best Hard Rock/Metal albums I own. (And I own a lot of albums.)
034580404X|5.0|Loved everything about this series. What's not to love about this three volume set.  I bought two sets, one for my daughter and one for myself.
B000BISBDY|4.0|The only song I don't like is the remastered verson of &#34;The Man Comes Around&#34;, the rest are &#34;must have's&#34;.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I tried to download this app it won't let me install it. so now i have to hlgo on my computer if i want to watch a video. Thanks a lot voyage apps!!!!! i hate this stupid app!!!!
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|First of all. these are great movies transferred onto Blu-ray with excellent sound. Watching these movies again now in HD with THX sound makes for great viewing.<br /><br />Since I already like these movies (as probably most people here) I won't go into the content of the movies. Besides, there are plenty of true movie reviews available on actual movie review sites. I will rate the product (movies as well as format and quality) I received.<br /><br />This &#34;boxed&#34; set is exactly that...a cardboard boxed set with a pull-out DVD holder. It is firm quality (strong) cardboard with smooth coated inserts for the DVDs. The movies are a pretty good transfer considering the age of the originals. The sound quality really enhances the enjoyment of these movies.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy having these Indy movies on Blu-ray in my collection. I don't think you will be disappointed either especially if you already like Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Although I love the movies (I even like Crystal Skull), I rate the entire product only 4 stars because it's not perfect and does not have as much &#34;extra&#34; information as I had hoped. Also, oddly,  these DVDs do not resume play where I left off if I turn my DVD player off and then back on again while the disc is in the tray.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|Thank you Amazon for a wonderful FAOTD!!! Great, quick workout and free to boot. I really like thAt there's but one permission too! Will reevaluate and may up my rating after trying it more. Fantastic - this would have been a great one for Mother's Day but the thought is appreciated anytime.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I think this is a very good game it helps me get stronger and I take one step at a time so I really like that
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|The music is solid, the creativity sends these recordings over the top.  If you have the first album, you need the 2nd.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This new series is exciting; being well written and well acted!  Although the story is not as complicated as the Game of Throne series, the beautiful costumes, drama, acting, directing, and stunning scenery are very comparable.  I started watching episode 1 on a plane trip, and finished the season by the end of the trip, it's just that good.  My husband and son will love it as well, so I'll be watching the season again with them.  I just wish the season had more episodes, I wasn't ready for it to end!!  Way to go History Channel, you've got a winner!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a great app.  Once it takes you thru the tutorial, it is really fun!  I would recommend this game.
B00A3T5CGU|3.0|have not have tihe opporunity to use it yet.  if i can remember to put the kindle in the car maybe i can use it
B004LWZVZC|5.0|This is so educational. We grew up learning about the assassination but not the things that came afterward. Very good movie
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|So, I was very concerned about this book considering the reviews I'd read. I'm glad to say it wasn't quite as bad as that. Considering the major issues that Eva and Gideon have during the first two books of the series, I find it totally believable that they would not be able to work through them in a single book. Additionally, I really like the characters so having a bit more to the story is not a bad thing IMHO. The main reason why I'm giving this book a 4 rather than a five is because it was JUST shy of too much sex and not enough plot. (I know, TOO much sex?? Who knew I'd be saying that!) Anyway, I encourage you to judge for yourself.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|This was a very funny romantic comedy. It's older but still very funny. Had to also order one for my son.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Having to write a review before you can move on is a bit stupid.  Otherwise it is entertaining and addictive. Kept me up past bedtime.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This was a great movie. It's full of action, has a great story line and a superb cast. Denzel is fantastic as always
B00CHILW64|3.0|Not sure what I was expecting, but if you want a feel good story don't go here! Probably a close portrayal of events. Good movie but grim details.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This was a fantastic movie. It's an excerpt from history that our younger generation knows nothing about. Was a great story with a different point of view.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I THINK THIS APP IS FUN. I like trying to find my way through the rooms. Just the right level of difficulty.
B00867GJYK|5.0|An excellent movie for young children. There's an interactive game menu after the movie. My 5 yr. old Grandson and I were playing the games and all of a sudden we had answers from everyone in the house. Older kids & adults were watching and we didn't even realize it. Very entertaining day.
B008602KQI|1.0|I can't believe that after so much evil that the Roman empire did in the coliseum and after so much emulation of those Roman evils by the Nazis during WWII, Hollywood has the audacity to make a movie that promotes and commemorates those evils with love and sensuality mixed in it.<br /><br />Shame on Hollywood for producing such an evil film.<br /><br />People: Stop subscribing to these garbage promotions of evil from Hollywood so that the financial pressures will convince the stupid producers to promote something good.  This country has lost its sense of good and bad.<br /><br />Shame on Hollywood for this stupid Nazi-promoting film.  There was no condemnation of the barbaric behavior of gladiator games in the film, so it is evil.  Shame on Hollywood!!!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This was a really good action movie. Kudos to Ben Affleck for a great movie. He's another very versatile actor
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this is a pretty cool little app. I'm enjoying myself figuring stuff out. And it's nice that I was able to try it out for free. ADS are not bothersome so far.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the pinterest app! Considering I am a self-proclaimed Pinterest addict, being able to access the site from my kindle fire &amp; my phone has been wonderful. I use it for everything, from planning my wedding to figuring out dinners. Can't wait until you can send pins to people on the kindle app like you can on the phone app.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|The writer and director must be huge fans of Sam Raimi as this has the campy (and funny) humor of the Evil Dead series.  This began fairly tame and quite frankly kind of stupid.  But, I stuck with it (after some serious eye rolling) and am so glad I did.  I ended up laughing a lot...and pretty hard.<br /><br />This is a low budget 2 star movie at first glance.  yes, it is completely absurd.  But I had to give it 4 stars because it made me laugh so hard and so often.  I'm 48 and this is stupid mixed with smart humor.  Very much in the vein of the Sam Raimi Evil Dead series, especially in tune with Army of Darkness (Evil Dead 3).<br /><br />Rent it or buy it and enjoy the ride!.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|overall good game as levels got higher it was more difficult- fun the only negative is I wish there were more levels
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game. love escape games. challenging and fun to play. wish there were more games like this on kindle soon.
B002QFYJF4|5.0|I remember going to see this movie in the theater when it came out. There are many movies that have several people who's live intertwine in many ways.  The characters and their emotions, how they feel about themselves. Their past and their present circumstance. People struggling to come to terms with who they are and who they want to be. Regret over life choices and negative consequences that ripple through other peoples lives.  Suppose I might get more in depth with my opinion of why I like this movie so much, but I'm tired. ;)
B005Y423ZC|5.0|It is rare for me to be able to write to vocal music, but Adele strikes the balance between wirk and play.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This movie is fantastic for those interested in reincarnation and the effects of one life on future ones.  It is well produced, well acted, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is very fast paced and moves along quickly.  You can't miss any of it or you will be lost because it is a very complicated plot line.  This is the kind of movie you could watch several times and still get more out of it.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|This movie will make you stupid. You would have to be REALLY drunk to watch this movie. I watched it for free and felt like I paid to much money. I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie that I'll never get back. I'd recommend watching Showgirls instead. At least Showgirls has a better plot.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I was into reading this book.  I was expecting something exceptional to happen, but it never did!  I would have loved to learn more about the characters and their purpose.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had played this on my dad's iPad a couple days ago and I decided to get it on my kindle. Even though it is short it is awesome.
B00CT2P6VA|3.0|Why, without touching the screen does the pearl move on its own or 'bounce' back in the opposite direction. This is using turns and ruins the scoring. The premise is fine but the narrative is annoying. A disappointment. It may function better on other devices but my Galaxy Note must not like it.
B00656C6KK|5.0|I was very please with this cd.  It is very touching as most of the songs were written by Doris Day's late son.  The quality of her voice is beautiful and some of the songs were compositions I had never heard before. What a talented and wonderful lady!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|AWESOME, GREAT with my Kindle Fire HD. I wanted to print from my tablet and my Samsung Galaxy S3. My phone kept requesting a Samsung printer which I don't own. Wonderful app.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|My first automatic, my first Seiko so take my thoughts for what they are worth.<br /><br />For the price, I am very happy with this watch.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- As mentioned by other reviewers the strap is the weak point on this watch.  It may be short for some, and the lower quality doesn't match with the watch.  I find the strap sufficient for the price point and may replace later depending the on the longevity of the watch.<br />- The product description says you can manually wind the watch by turning the crown, the watch I received DOES NOT have that feature.  To wind the watch, if you are unable to wear it, you have to 'swing the watch from side to side in a horizontal arc' according to the instructions included.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great looking watch.<br />- For timekeeping mine lost &#60;15 seconds over a week.<br />- I do wear it every day and have not had it stop on me yet. I do work a desk job.
0553386794|5.0|George R. R. Martin is an absolutely fantastic author and I am a devoted fan of his books. If you like fantasy novels and don't mind a bit of vulgar, vile and vivid imagery in a book, then I highly recommend it.
B00005NKKV|5.0|Makes you wonder why they broke up the duo when they could make such beautiful music together. The harmonies Art Garfunkle lends to the music are priceless!
0446310786|5.0|I had to buy another &#34;Mockingbird.&#34;  I read it at least once a year and my last outing was with pages falling apart.  It is one of those books that is endlessly entertaining and endlessly heartbreaking.
0470474874|5.0|I'm sure that the book is really great, but I'm new to Excel, and Windows 8. My goodness it's 2013, you can't even buy Word 2010 anymore. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm Leary about buying the book because, in my view, when I look at the new version of Excel, it appears quite different than older versions. I know plenty of people who recommend this book. It is not my goal to speak poorly of the author. I just wish he would publish a newer version for 2013. If the author had an updated version, I would buy it.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|Before I begin, let me just say that I gave this album 3 stars based on the fact that I appreciate the fact that Kanye kept his word and created an absolutely chaotic and polarizing album that has little to no chance of any form of mainstream success. With that said, listeners will either love or hate the album and I highly suggest you preview it before spending your hard earned money on it.<br /><br />Now, many critics and some die hard Kanye fans are raving that this album is a \\"classic\\", a \\"game changer\\" and \\"revolutionary\\"; that Kanye is taking it to \\"the next level\\", \\"an artistic genius\\", and \\"a rap god\\"... I won't argue that the album is definitely on another level but to call it a game changer and a classic, well a couple things are wrong about this:<br /><br />First off, the album seemed very dark and schizophrenic to me. If you haven't heard it yet, let me try to paint a picture of it for you: Imagine being in a large dark warehouse, the air heavy with the sweet/putrid scent of sweat and blood; your head is pounding with the sounds of heavy bass and distorted grimy synth echoing to atmospheric sounds of heavy breathing and manic screeching that sends shivers down your spine and grates at you like the sounds of a dying pig. After what seems like an eternity of relentless sonic assaults on your eardrums, the noise abruptly stops and and the silence is filled with the sounds of an old vinyl record and the scratchy soundtrack to an old jazz song your grandfather used to listen to when you were a kid. Your heart begins to calm down, you relax and begin to enjoy the music and nostalgic memories it brings when the record suddenly scratches and your ears are assaulted once again with the chaotic cacophony that is now known simply as Yeezus.<br /><br />Like I said before, you will either love it or hate it, and the album is definitely different than any mainstream hip hop, or album you've heard. Now, the fact that critics are hailing Kanye for his creativity, however, does bother me. The fact is, that the majority of the tracks were not produced by Kanye, and the ones that were, share the credits with at least two other producers. His lyrics on the album are fairly weak and his days of socially conscience rap are gone, replaced with crude lyrics littered with racial epitaphs and misogyny. One could argue that Eminem built his career on this type of lyricism but one also has to remember that his Relapse Album was one of his worst to date...even according to him. Now with an album title like Yeezus and a song called \\"I Am A God\\", I was hoping for more of a solid concept to the album, similar to J Cole's Born Sinner (definitely worth buying). However, both titles like the rest of the album fell short of \\"genius\\" for me and seem to be created more for controversy and album sales rather than commentary and story telling. And like the overall album, everything feels extremely disjointed and out of place. Some critics are saying that the album seamlessly alternates through genres, I call it abrupt and polarizing breakdowns that feel like there is no rhyme or reason to the madness.<br /><br />Some people will tell you that the album needs to be absorbed and listened to a couple times before the genius of the project sets in, and here's where I will argue with those who are saying that the album is an \\"instant classic\\". A \\"classic\\" is something that immediately grabs you the moment you hear it, something that instantly makes you smile, get out of your seat and dance like there's no tomorrow. A classic is something that you can play 20 years from now and still feel the exact same excitement as when you first heard it. Yeezus is not a classic nor anywhere near \\"album of the year.\\" I highly doubt that any other artist will follow in Kanye's footsteps on this one and this is definitely not the new face of hip hop nor was it meant to be. This album was and is a big F-You to the industry. A dark joke if you will, created by a mad artist teetering on the edge of insanity/genius. Just like the documentary \\"Exit Through The Gift Shop\\", Yeezus proves that regardless of whether or not your creation is good or not, it will sell on the basis of the artist's reputation and popularity. The album is definitely worth listening to simply because it is so out there. Will I listen to it again? Probably not. But if I did, my top picks from the album would be New Slaves, Blood on the Leaves and maybe Bound 2 (which, by the way, is a horrible closer to the album in my opinion).
B005UBNKWO|1.0|When I recived the pacage it did not come with the fan it only with the AMD!This is the worst thing I have ever goten from amazon and I am not happy with this at all.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Usual greatness from Grisham. Kept me hooked throughout the book, and left me wanting more. Theo Boone is a great series
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game and cute too!I have never had a game like this one. Everybody should try this very very wonderful cute game to play on your device
B0038AUY96|4.0|The Snowman was brilliant, again i was lead into Harry Hole's life of detective work and trying to find the killer while becoming attached to the characters and gripping the book at times when i was caught in the suspense of it all.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I would have given this give stars, but there were sections I found tedious. The mini-games were quite good! I look forward to the sequel.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I found this book really amusing in a delightful way, the main character does not seem to realize that he has aspergers and his interactions with rosie are awkward and heart warmingly hilarious. It was an easy read where you easily became attached to the characters which in my eyes is what makes for a good book :)
B009A87ZKG|5.0|The movie does an outstanding job in portraying a very important commander during WWII,  George C. Scott OWNED the role, as did many of the other actors.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|It was bitter sweet reading the last book, especially after becoming so attached to the main characters through out the series of books, It took me down paths where i thought i had the killer pinned but then it would twist and turn and surprise me. I have really enjoyed reading Jo Nesbo's books from the first sequence through to this one.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I enjoy the Bad Piggies HD games because the presentation of the game is so colorful and also challenging.  It's really fun to play.
1616550414|5.0|Love The Book,Fast Delivery no problem at all.if your a fan you must buy this epic of awesomeness book. Love it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked this game. If you like the game clue you will like this game. wish there was more levels.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Every chapter ends with a hanger making it hard to put the book down ever. One of the best books i have ever read.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Had a difficult time putting this book down between time to read on. What a talent for creating a complicated mystery. Truly enjoyed it.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Action packed! clint eastwood style. Goverment FBI loses bad guy, and passes through town. The sheriff has to take care of it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Was definitely worth the wait. Hope the next one is out soon! Can't get enough of Gideon Cross! He is yummy.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I loved the game for months and  was totally addicted, right up to Level 23.  Out of the  blue, my park was lost, with nothing but the cryptic &quot;Log into Facebook with your e-mail&quot; to hint at how to get it back.  Sorry, but I don't appreciate such cruelty.  I'm off to play better games...
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not your typical Grisham novel. Completely unbelievable but I couldn't help but wonder what was coming next!  A good beach read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Cool Game your Dragons if you get to level 11 you get second Island<br />plus Doesn't allow updates. Best part is buy stuff for your Dragon.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Ben Afflect did an amazing job in thhis movie. This is a nail biter.Adults only-violence.Once again ,Jimmy Carter wasn't given the credit he deserved for the release of the Americans,but other than that, I loved the Movie.
B000P0J0A6|3.0|I remember the show being a lot better when I watched it years ago.  Watched with a couple of teenagers and other family members everyone laughed at how bad it is.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This movie really follows what we were told happened. I loved the the main character was female. I would watch it again.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|One of the all-time classics it really is a must have for classic film lovers. Thank you for a great experience.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|This app works just like it is supposed to as far as I know on my phone and tablet. Minimal user, usually am on my laptop.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|i have another game just like this game so I got this game and what you do in it is like play pirates. *my sons words*
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I first bought Wool #1 and read it a couple of years ago.  I remembered it and when I saw the Omnibus, I had to buy it.  This book cost me a lot of sleep and a couple of groggy days at work.  It was so hard to put down each time I picked it up.  The characters are well-formed.  My curiosity about the silo and the people who lived there was skillfully fed, pulling me along, eager to uncover the next nugget of understanding.  I cared about the principal characters.  I am excited to know there will be more to come and I look forward to reading them.  I highly recommend this.  It is a solid read, a good and unusual story line.
B004BLTNM0|5.0|WOW! This was a great film.Remember,this is a female revenge film,they weren't going for the oscar! This is America's answer to the Scorpion films. Lot's of blood,sex,blood,nudity,and revenge! A must for anyone's cult collection.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Still cannot find it, so it does not work for me!!!!!!!!<br />worst app ever, maybe Amazon  should fix their apps to make sure they work!!!!
B004SIMNF0|5.0|I had recommended this one to people when they saw me using it. It is easy, very well made and constructed...excellent quality from  all the way around.I love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good. game makes you think. I liked it . my kids. liked it. to  but. was very easy,I give it a 4 1/2 .
B008745B32|3.0|Book seemed to drag on with a very disappointing ending. I enjoyed the style of writing, just not the way I expected this book to turn out.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I honestly read this book as if I was watching a movie. (I hope they make it into a movie!) I've never read a book that was written in this style, and I enjoyed it very much! I didn't want it to end!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am totally addicted and only 10 levels in...not too easy and not too challenging.  keep them coming mobigrow!  Please add more levels so I don't have to quit playing...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have finished with the first 8 levels and am left wanting more! Need more levels! fun game for all Ages.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|This was my husband's idea and I could not be happier! We started using this camera when our baby boy was born, the great thing is that we can log in from anywhere (cellphone, computer at work, from overseas when traveling) and still be able to check on our baby. with this camera you are able to listen, watch, speak, set motion sensors and infrared light and alarms to be sent to your email account. It works with a wifi connection, so be aware that the wifi/network must be on at all times. If you what a backup plan I would recommend buying a cheap audio monitor. We got this one NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor. Now we own 2 more... one for our dog and it works great when we are not home!
B0097BY3K6|4.0|Blending classical and modern pop songs together is simply amazing. I absolutely love his passion for this genre of music.  He's brilliant.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|While I was sufficiently caught up in this story, it didn't have the the same grab for me as the authors previous two books...particularly &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;. I would probably recommend it to friend but would not classify it as one that &#34;I just couldn't put down&#34;.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game it is addicting and challenging and fast paced which is what  i like but when  I paid  for the full version I thought I would get all the levels but you have to pay 99 cents if you want more I wish they would change that
B004MPJZ1O|5.0|I remember being told about this film in the high school cafeteria and thinking how rude it was to talk of such a film nevermind to watch this film.  I intentionally ignored it whenever I would see it on the shelf at the video rental store.  Funnily enough after so many Walking Dead episodes, I saw it on netflix and hit play and discovered an incredible kindness on the part of the filmmaker and the lead actor, Camille Keaton.<br /><br />Folks, THIS is what gangrape looks like.  This is what African women experienced in America, this is what the Germans called \\"Joy Division\\" and the Japanese called \\"Comfort Women.\\"<br /><br />This SHOULD have been talked about at Womyn Center meetings.  This movie said everything about rape and it was made by an Israeli man and performed by a brave woman who evoked Boadicea in her performance.  I did NOT see anything that was described in Roger Ebert's review of the film.  I never heard of any reviews before seeing this film last night.  But I NEEDED to be educated about the Holocaust before I could have seen this film and INSTANTLY recognize it for what it is.  It's about that small town bullying that went on in backwater German hamlets where the townspeople would abuse the outsider without remorse, it's about the official start of the annhilation of foreign women as a matter of policy with no compunction or concern and the true face of the perpetrators. I found myself AMUSED by how stupid the rapists were throughout the film momentarily distracted from the crime they were committing because they are so absurd and so petty and so DIRTY.<br /><br />Finally, this film that I saw for the first and only time as an adult - it is not about licentiousness or exploitation.  It is DEFINITELY from the side of the rape victim.  It is not gratuitous, the woman does not go on a spree.  I wouldn't even call it revenge but we do see something inside the person that I believe was naturally already inside the lead actor - call it courage maybe - butit's a natural warrior and this is what it looks like when she is offended and you left her alive.<br /><br />This is a movie for feminist not for sadists or vigilantes.  This movie shows what all those episodes of Law and Order: SVU can never communicate by FORCING us to watch them gangrape her.  This is what it is like to be forced to watch Nanjing, to be forced to be lined up in NEAT rows while your fellow camp inmates are raped during a party when German soldiers want a little R&R and head for the nearest concentration camp - maybe that's why they weren't concentrated in Germany.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this app. I like brain teasers and hidden objects games. This was a great combo of both. Four stars, because there just wasn't enough levels.
B006ZB3V2C|2.0|I saw this on the free app of the day and checked it out. The screenshots it has on the site are not accurate and the options are few, which leaves me to guess this &quot;free&quot; version was a misleading demo. It was not worth being on my Kindle for a day since there's a better program on it.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|I wanted to view this for my interest in 3d animation and ended up liking it for the warm fuzzies. Only corny in a few parts and well done as a feature, it was worth watching and funny. Laughing out loud funny. Good jokes, good timing.<br />And they lived happily ever after, almost.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I did'nt hear much about this movie and what a complete shame. My daughter is crazy about it and to be honest so is my whole family.
0689829590|5.0|It came promptly and I was able to read it to my grandson several times before we had to leave to return home.  The book was in good shape.
B0015FQZJE|5.0|To listen to it in vinyl is 100 times better, there are so many details in the background of the composition going on with the guitars that are not so noticeable on the cd. The drums sound amazing!  Next I'm getting As the palaces burn
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a Very fun game though it's kind of easy. Great for a free game but it needs more levels
0345423496|4.0|Light summertime reading recommended only for fans of Clarke.  It was entertaining and a fast read.  I wanted to finish out the trilogy but not a book I'd keep on the shelf.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|The auto reverse do not work and this was a use one and I wanted new.<br />Not happy with that.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm not usually one for True Crime books, but found myself staying up until very early in the morning to finish reading this. Once I opened Gone Girl, I couldn't put it down! Delightful twists, prose written for the 21st Century Audience and a novel take on a genre that has been done to death.
B00COQKE2M|5.0|It takes a lot of courage to release an album like this.  It would have been easy for Falling in Reverse to just keep with the formula they established on \\"The Drug In Me Is You.\\"  Instead they took a risk and the results are an album that is easily the best of 2013 so far.  Rap, glam metal, 80's pop, metalcore, and MCR/Blink182 style punk are all mashed together to come up with a killer sound.  Fun (and at times) hard hitting lyrics about a guy who self reflects on his demons, his recovery, and why he is the man he is.  I am also impressed with the lead guitarist.  Based on the last album and on parts on this one...you know the guy has the chops reminiscent of the 80's \\"Shrapnel\\" artists.  He has the restraint not to over shadow the magic that is happening on this album.  The one thing that is unfair is this album will be brushed aside and over looked being released the same week as Kanye's \\"Yeezus.\\"  \\"Fashionably Late\\" is a better album.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|This inspiring soundtrack takes you to the Island of Berk with it's orchestral sound mixed with traditional Celtic instruments. A must have for anyone who loved the movie.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|finally got this app after waiting for around 3 months. its the best app i have tried so far that can do tts text to speech and annotations so well. will update my review with specifics as I explore it more in coming days.
B004U52VPS|3.0|We play various games several times a week (everything from scrabble to battlemasters). I bought this game as a surprise gift for my better half who plays the cellphone version even in bed at 3am.<br /><br />This is a neat little gift. It's great for small parties and game nights with small children (4yrs+ recommended because of small parts). It's not something that us regular serious gamers will keep in rotation through the week but we'll pull it out once in awhile for some mindless fun! Although, I'm tempted to keep one fort assembled and have us take turns to see who does the dishes each week. Or maybe bring to work for some lunchtime rounds with coworkers.<br /><br />The pigs, \\"logs\\", and extra point thingies are hard plastic with the birds being rubbery (think pet toys) and you only need a place to set them up (away from anything valuable is wise). The cards are easy to read and there are a few difficulty levels to choose from. It may seem like it's messy once things get knocked down but we didn't drop any parts off our little breakfast table. After about 30 mins and five rounds, we were ready to move on to something else.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good buy.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this app its fun and very hard at the beggining to shoot and move at the same time but I like a challenge
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|love the movie  saw the remake a few weeks ago a little bit defferent but i still enjoyed it will buy it when it comes on dvd
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I NEEDED ONE FOR MY GRANDSON KINDLE.  HE LEFT THE ONE THAT CAME WITH THE KINDLE AT HIS OTHER GRANDMOTHER HOME. IT'S NICE TO HAVE TWO SO HE DOES NOT HAVE TO REMEMBER TO CARRY IT WITH HIM. HE IS ONLY EIGHT AND HIS MIND IS SOMETIME ASLEEP.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great graphics easy to use. Great free solitare game to download on kindle fire. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a game to help pass some time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved reading this book!  Once I started I couldn't put it down.  I was surprised at some of the twists, but found the story of Sky and Holders life inspiring.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|This game is so awesome my little brother keeps taking my tablet to play it.anyway I like it.you should get it. It's really really good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Coolest game ever I play it everyday I love this game<br />Omg I wish there was a three everyone should play this game I hope ever one play this game
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great game but, it goes to update, and about 2 percent from being complete, it always says connection is lost, I believe it's because they updated it, and the updated version is not in the Amazon market, please look into it
B00992CF6W|3.0|Well it's a cool game at first but it gets a little boring I mean graphics are terrible survivalcraft is just like real life unlike this and survivalcraft is way cheeper for only $3.99 instead of $6.99 get it instead
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This was definitely a fun, fast paced read - but I really think you need to like your computer games to enjoy this book. Even more than that, the target group for this book is for those who know/lived through the early days of computer games. The references to such games really is non-stop and I have a hard time believing it would be as enjoyable if you've never heard of games like bards tale - and most of the games referenced are far more obscure.
159463176X|2.0|I thought, as I sailed through the first 150 pages of the book this was going to top the first two.<br />So disappointed.  Will I buy the next one.  No.  Editing was off, the predictable was poorly done<br />and I was bored.
0920668372|5.0|I found this book many years ago, when I was teaching in an inner city school.  It's a great book for children up to 2nd or 3rd grade.
0525425772|5.0|Thank you for once again giving a teacher a wonderful teaching tool.  Putting Theo in, not making him perfect but with a backbone<br />of  knowing what is right and what is wrong and to have the courage to stand by his conviction gives all of us the faith that we too can do something good.
B006PFSVYQ|3.0|I bought the Hop Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy + Ultraviolet set for my son, not because I like this movie (I don't really care for it-- it's just silly), but because he's little and loves it.  A few years from now he'll be wanting movies with babes and explosions, so I'm enjoying this while I can.<br /><br />This review is to comment on the download code for the Digital Copy + UltraViolet access.  If this feature is very important to you, proceed with caution.  I was able to download the digital copy today (June 18, 2013) and also add it to my UltraViolet account.  However, the expiration date listed on the enclosed flyer is August 27, 2012.  So the download code could cease to be valid at any time.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Isnt the green lantern suppose to be black?? I didnt even watch the movie for that reason, because hes white. im not racist, im just remembering what i saw on the cartoons.
0385535147|5.0|Grisham has done it again--intriguing and easy reading book.  Anyone who enjoys reading down-to-earth stories with a twist should enjoy this book.
1401941893|5.0|I bought this at the airport in Australia and I enjoyed reading every word of it!! The affirmations in this book absolutely work and Miranda is a huge inspiration. Attitude really is everything. Thank you Miranda, now I'm starting to TREASURE MYSELF.
1451695195|4.0|This story has all the credibility that a scientist requires, with all the mystery need to satisfy a spiritualist. The book has a large appendix of other resources and references and so seems longer than it is.  The writing is clear and straightforward - easy enough for any lay person. A good place to look for the answers we all seek.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it so much awesome game need to get best hide and find game yet cant quit playing this game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book! I wish I could enter the book to meet the characters . I almost didn't read it because it sounded so sad, but I'm so glad I did.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is fun and gives you lots of opportunity to exercise your imagination. Very colorful graphics. You can easily progress through the various levels.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game for android is great. It downloaded and installed effortlessly. I haven't had any problems with it. The graphics look beautiful and the colors are nice. I enjoy playing the game to see the scenery and try to work up the levels. The game is fun and entertaining, but some levels are proving to be pretty difficult. Some I can't seem to get past. Overall I'm satisfied with the game, and hope to download more games from Rovio. If you're wondering about this game, I would say try it, because I think you'll like it.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|its fun and cute I have fun and my 2 yr old son has fun helping me<br />its easy and fun my son like the bright colors. and its cool that you get to keep going even if you lost the last battle in the tournament

159463176X|5.0|Indeed, a beautifully written piece by an acclaimed author. Hosseini's writing is extraordinary because while reading his novels, the reader gets into a visible journey, as if he was watching a movie. This book is a masterpiece. It tells a story of family bonds and sad destiny of the actors. The author professionally ties one actor to another through various times from earlier in the century to early 2000's. Many reviewers stated they disliked the jumping from one period to another. I must disagree. Especially for jumping from one period to another is what makes the reading of this book a pleasant journey. Experience it.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The Dark Knight trilogy is hands down the best of all the Batman movies. It gives you the background of Batman. I thought it was great and now I have all of them together in one set.

B000024TFY|3.0|I used to own this record, back in the late seventies decade.  My review here is going to be a lot shorter, than usual.<br /><br />Highlights on this album include:<br /><br />\\"Victim Of Changes\\"...This song is probably the VERY BEST, on this album. It is very powerful, vocally, ESP. w/ the explosive scream, @ the END of this song.  Musically, this could remind me of a PERFECT Black Sabbath tune. And yet, it could also remind me \\"Stranglehold\\" OR \\"Writing On The Wall\\", by Ted Nugent, somewhat.<br /><br />\\"The Ripper\\"...Another very good song here, that I was disappointed with @ first, but it did grow on me.  This tells the story of Jack The Ripper & vocally, this song could remind me of a song that Uriah Heep could sing perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Tyrant\\"...This song is still as excellent as ever.  I've always loved this song, very much.<br /><br />\\"Genocide\\"...I love this song a lot too. The title of Judas Priest's 3rd album, \\"Sin After Sin\\", came from this song, lyrically.<br /><br />\\"Prelude\\"...This is an INSTRUMENTAL song, that WASN'T incl., on the ORIG. record.  It's pretty good, I think.<br /><br />The REMAINING songs are okay...only passable in my opinion.<br /><br />This 2nd album by Judas Priest is recommended.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I am able to see my email, sent, draft, trash, and other folders. I really like it, I'll keep it.
B00005K9LK|3.0|It took me 31 years to finally buy this 1982 album on a remastered CD format.  I would like to offer my review & opinions of each song, as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"The Hellion\\"...A very short instrumental intro to this album, which is pretty good.<br /><br />2.  \\"Electric Eye\\"...Continuation of \\"The Hellion\\", both of these songs were usually played together, when I heard them in 1982.  This song is pretty good.<br /><br />3.  \\"Riding On The Wind\\"...This song is pretty good.<br /><br />4.  \\"Bloodstone\\"...This song is pretty good.<br /><br />5.  \\"(Take These) Chains\\"...This song WASN\\"T written by Judas Priest.  I remember this from 1982 & it is also one of my top favorites, on this album.<br /><br />6.  \\"Pain & Pleasure\\"...This song is pretty good.<br /><br />7.  \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\"...This is the title track & I'm NOT too crazy about THIS song @ all.<br /><br />8.  \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin\\"...I still love this song just as much NOW, as I did 31 years ago. This was out in 1982. It is the very BEST song, on this ENTIRE album & rightfully so. I could always understand why this was such a GREAT hit. And how could I forget to mention that this is definitely my TOP favorite song, on THIS album.<br /><br />9.  \\"Fever\\"...This song is pretty good.<br /><br />10.  \\"Devil's Child\\"...This song is okay, but definitely NOT one of my favorites, either.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks<br /><br />11.  \\"Prisoner Of Your Eyes\\"...This song is TOO long & nothing too spectacular, either.<br /><br />12.  \\"Devil's Child\\"...recorded Live in 1982 & same opinion as #10 above.<br /><br />This album is recommended.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Well what can you say from a sony product, simply amazing. I have not had any trouble with this control and I have 30+ hours a week of gaming time.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game. The puzzles were awesome. The sound was even a bit scary and mysterious. Well worth the time and money!
B002UNMWAG|4.0|I really enjoyed the first Boondock Saints movie and was worried that this movie wouldn't be as good as the first.  I must say that this movie has the same amount of action as the first one. It also has almost all of the original characters from the first movie in it which is something seeing as how this movie came out nearly 10 years after the first one.  The only thing that really bothered me was that the movie just seemed \\"generic\\". From the cheesy lines, the goofy Hispanic man (who I assume is taking the role of Rocko from the first movie), to the way they have the FBI agent (who is a woman) acting just like the male FBI agent in the first one.  I think if they just made another movie without trying to tie every single little thing to the first movie, it would've been ok.  You may love this movie, but like I said, it came across to me as a cheesy sequel.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|This is the best Halford an the boys have sound in years, with all the classic hits are here, plus some rear back never heard live stuffs \M /
B00BEXB18M|5.0|From start to finish this album captures the band's signature sound hands down? Not sure about the negative buzz on song writing failures/lack of effort? WHAT? REALLY? ARE YOU KIDDING? What the hell are some of you looking for? Are you listening to the same stuff I hear! This is red-hot & heavy rock & roll which is what these guys are known for! If it were lame/that one thing, but it's not even close! Once again too much emphasis on matching up to the past and we all know new material always get over-critiqued and downplayed vs. past material gone by that sets a band's foundation! C'mon, there's lots of great riffs to sink your teeth into right away here! I noticed this immediately and I'm not even a diehard fan! Didn't need to listen much here to get into the grooves! This effort from Dave M. & co. delivers with ramming speed/rocking heavy! It's all good/worth checking out!

0143120581|5.0|Expecting my first child in a couple of weeks, I decide to use my last bit of leisure time to read some books. This book jumps into my mind. I used to think I surely knew what Chinese moms are, being a product of one. Sure, they have sky-high standard and expectation and they are persistent and strict. What else to be learned in such a book? Turns out I learned a lot. First, it connects my memories of my past to the specific points in the tiger-mothering that proved so useful in empowering the children. There are two points she made that I especially like and truly experienced myself growing up:<br /><br />1. There is no need to use praise/reward to motivate: when the kids improve and win, they will taste the sweetest reward in the world.<br /><br />2. Criticism is the best boost for self-esteem: it shows that the parents or teachers have high expectation and the kid is assumed to be able to do better.<br /><br />I would add to these two points a third one: do the hard parenting work at the beginning. A pursuit of high standard at the age of 7 or 8 means that there is no need to motivate at the age of 13 or 14. When I reached that age, my parents had to secretly alter the time on the clock in an attempt to persuade me to go to bed earlier and not study as hard as I was.<br /><br />Moreover, this book is a great conversation starter for me (a Chinese) and my white husband. We discovered that we shared a lot of views on how to raise our daughter. When I told him that Amy objects to sleepovers, to my surprise, after a few minutes of serious thinking, he wholeheartedly agreed with her and recounted to me how his own experience of sleepovers taught him that they brought more harm than benefit to a child/teenager.<br /><br />The negative comments on this webpage only highlighted the importance of this book. Raising a hard-working and responsible child will meet a lot of objection or sneer in the modern US. Tiger moms are forced to be tigers exactly because of the indulgent and lazy parenting style much of the richer world has embraced. Kudos to the one who speaks out.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Orson Scott card captures the imagination so you can visually see it in your mind like a movie I would recommend the whole ender series....
0385342071|4.0|(Contains light spoilers, nothing that to me -- isn't obvious based on the premise of the story -- but just a warning nonetheless)<br /><br />I enjoyed this book for the most part. It started off pretty slow.  I wasn't all that interested in Magnus and his family.  You already knew the storyline was shaping up that she wasn't going to end up with him, so I really hated investing time in that storyline.<br /><br />It wasn't until around page 180 or so, that the story line actually picked up for me.  I held out because I'm a firm believer in finishing a book and I'm glad I did.  I really enjoyed how the story played out with Sam, I really enjoyed Sam's character and wish I could have more of him!!  I also loved the office drama that played out and I did actually enjoy snooping through Sam's email along with Poppy.<br /><br />I found Poppy likable, but like others have mentioned, she's quite a bit like the other female leads in Kinsella's books.  However, I enjoy those female leads, so it didn't bother me and I still enjoyed Poppy.  I found her to be an enjoyable character and all the times she \\"meant well\\", I fully believed in the book.<br /><br />I think if she had sped up the drama between Magnus and Poppy and then used the office drama as the beginning relationship for Sam and Poppy, I would have preferred that.  The story line as is kind of drags until you get to the end of the book.  The first 200 pages, the book felt like it was never going to end.  Then the last 200 pages felt way too short and rushed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Okay so it's full of little plot holes and silly things and even places where it gets the geek mechanics wrong, but it's such pure fun good-guys-win geek adventure that you have to love it.  (Given that nothing ever happened with that Big Red Button, I gotta think we're getting a sequel, too...)
B004JN1D2I|5.0|One of my favorite modern works. Take the time to read the series. You won't regret it. How stupid is the word count requirement for this review platform?
B005TVYVI2|4.0|My trainer suggested this for timing my swimming motions. It works well. I wish it had a metal hook to clip onto my strap of my goggles instead of the plastic retainer and clip. The plastic retainer is hard to use, and the manual advises not using it for swimming. I prefer not to wear a swim cap, so my only option is the supplied clip.
0811876373|3.0|I purchased the cake pop maker and found that this book gives instructions for cake pops by combining frosting with baked cake.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|Anyone who has suffered the sort of loss that Yossi has will \\"get\\" this movie. Yossi's day-to-day grind with nothing to look forward to, his allowing himself to go to seed, his belief that no one could love him again, his fear that if he comes out of his shell or comes out of the closet, he will be scorned by his friends and co-workers  -- all these suggest that he's defeated from the start. But he's not. There's a small flame burning, and this movie follows his painful progression. Yossi reaches an important milestone when he makes contact with Jagger's parents and confesses to them his love for Jagger and the truth of their relationship, something Jagger himself would have done had he lived. This marks the moment of Yossi's actual coming out with mixed results -- Jagger's mother rejects, Jagger's father innately understands. From then on, the changes occurring inside Yossi speed up until he's able to respond to a younger \\"out\\" soldier who sees in him the value he is unable to see in himself. Eytan Fox's direction is flawless, as usual. Ohad Knoller gives a heart-breaking performance as Yossi, and Oz Zehavi is charming as the young soldier who could bring \\"joie de vivre\\" back into anyone's life.

B005DOL0R0|5.0|The Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve is well made and good looking.  Most importantly it protects the Kindle Fire very well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a great sequel to temple run. There are new obstacles, more places, and more fun than the first run. Instead of monkeys there is a big ape<br />.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the by the hour 24 hour view of the day.  Also the radar views are really neat as well as an accurate 7 day forecast.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Now the series becomes logic, because Fast 3 (Tokio Drift) don´t have any sense until now, that makes of this franchise better than ever. Fast 6, is an excellent film action-packed, it might to much like Michael Bay´s films, which really I don´t like,  because defies the laws of physics and falls into an amounts of meaningless action without direction, only to leave you astounded, playing with your intelligence. That is why I prefer the other 5 films.

1451695195|5.0|I've talked about this book to almost everybody I know. Proof of Heaven is a mind-expanding look at what happened when a neurosurgeon who didn't believe in an afterlife, survives a rare, almost always fatal infection, and experiences a glorious NDE himself.<br /><br />He was hospitalized in the facility at which he performs surgery. The other doctors were his close peers. Dr. Alexander had complete access to the medical data from his own brain scans, and what that data reveals was happening to his brain during his 7 days in coma makes an NDE impossible unless it occurred outside of his brain.<br /><br />Fortunately his son had the foresight to suggest that after having had the NDE and coming out of the coma, Dr. Alexander should not read stories about other people's NDEs until he had taken the time to write down in great detail what happened during his own.  What happened is riveting.

B006ZB3V2C|3.0|Product tested on 3 phones, Samsung Galaxy SII stock with Jelly Bean, SII running Cyanogen Mod with Jelly Bean, and HTC Sensation 4G Cyanogen Mod ICS. Immediately upon launch, crashed on all 3 devices. This version is actually 3 updates behind the one in Google Play store (that one is 2.9.4 and Amazon still has 2.9.1).<br /><br />I downloaded and tried the version in Google Play (it's free because you do not get all of the plug-ins for free like you do with the Amazon version) and it worked immediately upon launch. So, until the version on Amazon is updated, I won't be able to use the app, but it will remain in the cloud.<br /><br />I read the permissions and I also read why some of the questionable ones are needed. Maybe some of the folks that are freaked out about giving their location should read why it is needed...weather. If you want the weather, they need to know where you are (roughly, they only use latitude and longitude based on network location) so that you can get it, makes sense, right???<br /><br />***Update***<br /><br />The app still does not work on my Galaxy S2, but it does work on my Galaxy S4 and my HTC Sensation. Not sure what the difference is, I am using Jellybean on both Galaxy devices and the Sensation. So, if you have tried it before and have a new device, try it again. I like the app, I just don't like the fact that they have not updated their app on Amazon, and despite contact with the developer by many users, they have not released a fix. I will update my rating, but it's still not a five star app since it still immediately crashes on my other device.

B0053FANQS|5.0|And i didnt think much of it, I recently seen fast 6 and realized this FF movie was one i didnt have in my collection, so i ordered it up on AMAZON !! On to the movie itself, A little ***spoiler*** for those that may not have seen this.. This FF is the turning point movie in the series and frankly its probably one of my favorites, It brings most of the old crew back together for the first time since FF#1.  and frankly its a little darker, its not all neon lights and street races.. Its still alot about the cars and alot of car action for us guys that fell in love with this series for the cars and the car action (some of the latest FF is less about the cars and more about action adventure) and ive said that before in a few other reviews.  But this movie Fast 4  feels more serious, you deffinately get the impression that the series is taking a turn with this one.  I rewatched this today and its a great movie, There is alot that happens in this movie that you need to know and remember to understand fast #6, there are alot of references in Fast #6 to this particular movie in the series.  Most of you can watch fast #1 #2 (skip 3) watch #4 #5 and #6 and maintain the story line at this point. there are references in fast #6 in the end to Fast #3 Tokyo Drift so i may eat my words later on down the road.. guess we will just have to tune in and see what happens..

B008NR8YTQ|5.0|It's a great listen and really a good encapsulated history of the influence of, not just Jimi, but a number of musicians<br />who have helped to shape our modern day understanding of what the &#34;classic rock&#34; guitarists and artists were after.  The feel of the concert is friendly and there are actually moments when, if you close your eyes, you can see Gary, Billy and Mitch smiling as they feel each other out on &#34;Red House&#34;.  Good listening here.  Real good.

B00DF0POXA|3.0|I usually don't write reviews but i wanted to go out of my way to write about Yeezus because i have strong opinions about it<br /><br />If you liked 808's this album is probably for you. Kanye went back to using mostly distorted, electronic, auto-tune type music. Lyrically this album is great, Kanye has verses that have great flow and meaning like always but this is what really upset me about the album:<br />If you're looking for piano, orchestra, or soul type beats like Kanye is best at; you won't find it. Now granted MBDTF is probably one of the greatest rap albums ever and probably the best Kanye has ever dropped, so any album following that one is going to be hard to top, but Yeezus really swung and missed. Kanye did not use any old type beats in the late registration and college dropout days, Yeezus had no variety in sound like graduation or mbdtf, literally every song on yeezus sounds very similar.<br /><br />Kanyes lyrics and flow saved this album which is why id give it a 5-10 stars. I also respect him trying new styles and stuff but it really did not flow well with me, at least compared to what i know Kanye is capable of. Especially only having 10 tracks on the album, he even has more room for error. Give it a try, but for me its a disappointment.
1609611543|5.0|I consider myself a rational, intelligent person.  I understand the scientific theory and how to apply it.  I can see through most of the oprah-style hype about this or that diet or beauty product.<br />This book's title caught my eye: \\"Wheat Belly\\".  I am asked at least monthly when my baby is due.  I'm not pregnant.  I exercise regularly and really truly watch what I eat.  I have relatively skinny arms and legs but I look like I'm 5 months pregnant.  This weighs on my mind  and cannot figure out why this is.  In addition, I am ALWAYS TIRED.  A feel like I need a nap after breakfast.  And 2 hours after breakfast, I am consistently shaky, irritable, and STARVING.  I've always known carbs were part of the problem, so I try not to go crazy with carbs.  I rarely eat dessert and I pretty much don't eat sweets.  The name of this book piqued my interest because it seemed to encapsulate my problem.  I read it objectively, highly skeptical of things like this.  I am not a hippie nor a gullible housewife.  Dr. Davis made VERY COMPELLING points (including an actual example of mistaking someone with \\"Wheat Belly\\" for being pregnant), so, I decided to go wheat-free for one week to see what happened.<br />I am 5 days in, and in ALL HONESTY, my life has changed.  It took a few days.  The first few days I had withdrawal symptoms:  Headache, fuzzy-headed.  But, my gut felt AMAZING.  I had always thought discomfort after eating was just how life was.  I thought always being hungry and sluggish was just my unfortunate lot in life.  I did not eliminate all carbs, and still my gut felt, well, NORMAL.  I felt like MYSELF, not in constant discomfort.  Lunch would come and I was able to just realize it was lunch and eat it, instead of shakily unwrapping fast food in a starved panic.  Then, a couple days ago, I went to a sushi restaurant planning to have rice and fish, but it was closed.  My friend and I decided to go to an american-style restaurant where I pretty much had to order a sandwich and just \\"go off the diet today\\".  5 minutes after eating, I felt HORRIBLE.  My stomach hurt, it ballooned out, and I felt EXHAUSTED the rest of the afternoon.  It was then that I was convinced.<br />It has been 5 days, and I have lost 1 pound.  I realize if I eliminated all carbs, i would lose more weight.  But for now, just not having a bloated, crampy digestive system is good enough.  Also I am not utterly exhausted after eating.  These wonderful effects have completely convinced me that Wheat was the problem all along!!  And I am not one to follow fad diets or buy \\"hope in a jar\\".  This is not a fad diet, it is the real deal.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book, read it and decide for yourself.  I want to shout it from the rooftops!!ich and just \\"go off the diet today\\".  5 minutes after eating, I felt HORRIBLE.

For the first time in a long time I got a hold of a book that I absolutely could not put down. Sure some of this was predictable, but it was so well written that did not bother me. For a really good read that will probably be over much too quickly pick up this book. Please be aware this is never going to be great literature, but sit back and enjoy the ride.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|I think Ridley Scott ended up trying to make 3 movies here.  It's a shame, because the concept is an interesting one, but it is so full of unnecessary &#34;sensationalist&#34; rubbish that the original story gets clouded.  R-S, you need to make up your mind if you're making a Sci-Fi mystery (with a little shock & horror for good measure) or simply making a bad horror movie.<br /><br />If you go back & re-watch (Director's Cut) Aliens you will see the slow build of suspense and pure simplicity that made it the Classic it is today.
B000OLX4SU|4.0|Frankenstein's Monster is brought back to life in the 1994 retelling of Mary Shelley's classic tale. Kenneth Branagh stars as Doctor Victor Frankenstein, a man who becomes wholly consumed with the notion of cheating death after his mother dies during childbirth. Neither the love of his life nor his friends and colleagues can deter him from his quest to create new life, until the abomination that results from his blasphemous experiments escapes to seek revenge! Unlike in Francis Ford Coppola's stylized revision of Bram Stoker's DRACULA, Branagh's film returns to the Gothic traditions of the genre with a number of wonderful set designs and gloomy exteriors that call back to the Universal classics. As the lead, Branagh's overly dramatized portrayal of the obsessed doctor can be a bit mushy at times, but he pulls through with a surprising amount of pathos as he is confronted with the corrupt ethics and morality of his actions. While he may seem like an odd choice, as well, Robert De Niro commands the role of the vengeful monster, also bringing an air of sympathy and compassion to the creature before his vile contempt for Frankenstein sets in towards the fiery finale. Steph Lady and Frank Darabont's collaborated screenplay remains considerably closer to the text than most other adaptations, although it certainly takes its own liberties with the plot and characters. In spite of its strengths, however, this version is mostly unmemorable, and fails to produce the iconic imagery of the 1931 classic. It is nevertheless a worthwhile watch for fans of Gothic Horror.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Trust Robert Downey Jnr to add a twist to what could have been a pretty mundane movie.  His ability to treat his character with a balance of tongue-in-cheek and dark intensity really works well.  The scripting is clever & never too lame.  The chemistry between the main protagonists is electric.  All in all a great movie !
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|David and his group of friends head out to his family's cabin, where they think they can help his sister Mia get through her drug withdrawals in peace. It is there that David and Eric discover an evil book in the cellar, whose ancient incantations awaken the demonic forces that are lurking in the woods and cause each of their friends to become possessed! Fede Alvarez' new set up in the EVIL DEAD remake poses way too many logical inconsistencies to be ignored. A series of silly subplots are introduced to overcomplicate an otherwise simple and straightforward story. Cheap plot contrivances like Mia's history of mental health issues keep the teens locked in the cabin despite her desperate pleas to leave. EVIL DEAD is only saved by two things, but those two things sure make up for a lot. The shocking make-up and horrific special effects that are featured here are beyond compare, living up to (and even surpassing) the original in many ways. Alvarez also adds disgusting new twists to the gags from the first two films in this grueling and unrelenting splatterfest. While it is far from perfect, the EVIL DEAD remake is as good as any Horror fan could really hope for, and is enough to drive new audiences back to the classics.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B00B8PMWJI|3.0|26 films are gathered to tell THE ABCS OF DEATH, a Horror anthology that looks at death in its many splendid forms throughout a variety of shorts from around the world. Unfortunately, THE ABCS OF DEATH is a major upset that offers fewer hits than misses. While the themes and subject matter provide viewers with a wide range of different styles, it is perhaps too varied and inconsistent to work. A quick trip to your local film festival will generate far more interest, and it is difficult to dismiss the overall lack of quality based solely on the directors' budgetary constraints. While most have put a great deal of thought and time in to their brief segments, others seem to have been burdened by the entire process.<br /><br />\\"Apocalypse\\" kicks the series off with a bloody bang, then it's down hill from there. Angela Bettis' spindly short, \\"Exterminate,\\" is all-too-expected. ROBOGEISHA director Noboru Iguchi delivers something that is offensively tasteless and immature in \\"Fart.\\" \\"Gravity\\" sinks, but newcomer Thomas Cappelen Malling then offers the utterly fresh and original \\"Hyrdo-Electric Diffusion,\\" which combines the Acme-antics of two furry creatures together with a tinge of Nazisploitation. Fast-forward to \\"K,\\" and you'll get a Youtube-worthy animation about a killer s***. Timo Tjahjanto takes one of the few risks in the series to bring us \\"Libido,\\" a shocking short that brings us back to the days of Pasolini's SALO. Ti West must have run with the money, since the aptly-named \\"Miscarriage\\" is a sloppy and uninspired mess. Banjong Pisanthanakun counters with a worthy piece of Horror/Comedy in \\"Nuptials,\\" where a trained bird spoils the fun for its master. \\"Orgasm\\" is too artistic for its own good. \\"Pressure\\" comes off as a rushes and inadequate attempt to recreate the controversy found in A SERBIAN FILM. And then, there's \\"Quack.\\" Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett bring us the one film that feels like it fits in a sharp, witty, and purely entertaining short. Srdjan Spasojevic moves for a more meaningful approach with his own take on Body Horror in \\"Removed.\\" \\"S,\\" \\"T,\\" and \\"U\\" can best be described as \\"amateur,\\" to put it nicely. Comic artist Kaare Andrews follows in the footsteps of Richard Stanley and Ridley Scott with his Cyberpunk entry entitled \\"Vagitus.\\" \\"XXL\\" takes a stab at self image in Xavier Gens' bloody social commentary. Jason Eisener taps into his warped sense of humor once more in the mildly disturbing \\"Youngbuck.\\" And the series comes to a close in the on-screen insanity that is \\"Zetsumetsu (Extinction),\\" taking the nuclear fallout of Post-WWII Japan to outrageous new heights as only Yoshihiro Nishimura can.<br /><br />Concept outweighs execution when there is no guiding hand that is overseeing the entire production in THE ABCS OF DEATH. This experiment in Horror has generated a few noteworthy pieces, but on the whole, the anthology does not offer much replay value or staying power.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesc moves for a more meaningful approach with his own take on Body Horror in \\"Removed.\\" \\"S,\\" \\"T,\\" and \\"U\\" can best be described as \\"amateur,\\" to put it nicely.

B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Two feral children are discovered years after their father abandoned them in the woods, but they bring along an unexpected guest when they are taken in by their uncle in the supernatural thriller MAMA, from 2013. MAMA is a chilling and frightful ghost story whose most horrific moments come out of the children's eerie performances, rather than the sudden appearances of the spindly apparition. Victoria and Lilly have regressed in to an animal-like state, which causes them to run around on all fours and lash out aggressively. Their discovery within the dilapidated cabin makes for a truly unnerving experience. Director Andr&eacute;s Muschietti drowns each scene with oppressive feelings of tension and dread, and creates a number of disturbing images along the way. Where he falters most is in the storytelling, itself. MAMA is a simple rehash of so many other similar tales of ghostly revenge, with a familiar structure that rarely deviates from the status quo. The film's subtler moments are infinitely more effective than the outright shocks, due to the heavy reliance on computerized imaging that dispels all feelings of suspended disbelief. If it were to be rated solely on atmosphere and mood, however, MAMA would surely top the charts.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B003IWRE3I|5.0|In THE ROAD, a father and son embark on a perilous journey south in the hopes of finding food and shelter as the world dies around them. With no plants or animals left alive, the few people that they encounter have shed all signs of civilization as they resort to thievery and cannibalism in order to survive, leaving it up to the boy and his dad to keep the last flame of humanity alive within them. Few films are as bleak and unforgiving as John Hillcoat's adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel, THE ROAD. Fewer, still, possess the same emotionally uplifting feelings of love and hope despite their dark surroundings. THE ROAD is a beautiful and touching story depicting the undying love between a father and son, who are literally willing to die to protect one another after witnessing the end of the world. Viggo Mortensen proves, once again, that he is one of the finest actors of his generation in another devastating performance. The gut-wrenching scenes where his character must choose between mercifully killing his son or risking his capture at the hands of many evil men drive the emotional tension to its veritable extreme. Robert Duvall also makes an Oscar-worthy appearance in a supporting role, as well. While the finely-written characters and remarkable cast certainly serve as the film's core, it is the incredible art direction and utter desolation found in the production design that lead us to believe this truly is the end of the world. Hillcoat delivers on all fronts, and leaves us in a state of emotional shock from this deeply moving yet equally painful struggle to keep hope and love alive.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|A new family begins experiencing strange happenings in their suburban home after taking in one of their son's playmates from across the street in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4, the latest (and easily the worst) in the popular Horror franchise. The story has already strayed so far from the initial haunting that it is becoming a bore, especially when decreasing amounts of progress are made throughout each episode in revealing the secret occult origins behind the curse. The hand-held technique is no longer relevant, and it is used even more ineffectually when it comes to inciting any form of terror this time around, save for a single disturbing moment involving the Xbox Kinect in the living room. The \\"surprise\\" ending has been spoiled by casting Brady Allen as Robbie, who is far too evil from the very start. One can only hope that the series will either come to an end or take a dramatic shift in direction with the next film if they have any plans to continue.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

Before I purchased them, I viewed the pics of the shoes to make sure that they were water and oil resistant, which is printed on the bottom of the shoe. However, they are NOT. I had to watch my step all day at work, especially when dealing with the dish room and the marble floors in the bar. Water seemed to be more dangerous than oil. I'm now stuck with these shoes that I've only worn once and will never wear again.

B00D8KNG4Q|4.0|\\"Hanson's seventh studio album, 'Anthem', is jam-packed with breezy and organ-fueled summer tunes that perfectly combine fizzy saxophones and catchy melodies with slick guitar licks and effective drum patterns in order to create the ultimate dose of \\"feel-good\\"-happiness. Most of the tracks could easily become instant radio hits, and although a couple of the songs feel a bit too lyrically safe, the album as a whole provides plenty of highlights as well as overall musical consistency from start to finish. 'Anthem' is by far the most accomplished work the band has ever done, even if it doesn't quite reach its musical peak. However, it does get very close to perfection! This is just another proof of the magic and freshness that Hanson keeps bringing to the table, and if the evolution continues, their next album might just reach the top and rank as a true masterpiece. For now, we get to enjoy this cool compound of funk, rock and jazz, which is undoubtedly the most upbeat, soulful and positive record of 2013 (thus far).<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars.

0307476464|4.0|This was my first time reading anything by this author, and my first read of a book originally written in a non English language.  Likewise, this has been my first long book read on an e-book device.  Lots of first for this one.  On to the review.<br /><br />What first got me interested in 1Q84 was the title.  For those that do not know, \\"Q\\" is Japanese for 9. Ku or kyu in this place, makes the title a play on words thus equaling 1984.  Although this has a similar title to George Orwell's 1984 I think they are about as similar as flour and powdered sugar despite some of the snobby critic reviews saying otherwise.  I guess the most important part to mention is the translation is  surprisingly smooth and not much seems to be lost in translation nor does it ever really appear to be a translation with awkward lengths of text.<br /><br />This book was fun and kept me engaged, guessing, hoping, and wishing the best for the characters.  At times it felt that perhaps one thing was happening but I could never decide.  The author did a great job at keeping me trying to figure out why everything was happening.  Is it a dream?  Is it time travel?  Parallel worlds?  Purgatory?  I really couldn't appreciate the book until I finished it which also happens to be when everything actually made sense, for the most part.  This is of course how books should be, I should not know how the book will end before it ends.  This is a reflection of the author's great skill.  I think for the most part keeping an audience until the end is harder than one would think- especially for books.<br /><br />With all these great points for the book, one would wonder why 4 stars instead of 5.  Well to put it simply- the book just drags on relentlessly several times during the read.  I think the page count is something like 1100 pages; honestly, I think the author could have done fine if he cropped off a solid 300-400 pages.<br /><br />I also feel like it's worth mentioning Anton Chekhov's Sakhalin Island.I got the book after becoming interested in it after some of the characters were reading it in 1Q84.  This is just another point for how great the author is by making Anton Chekhov's travel journal sound so interesting.  I have got through the first 60 pages or so and it is slow  as dirt and about as dry as a dessert.  It definitely is not a pleasant read especially being a translation that reads as one would expect with several annotations and asterisks. I digress.<br /><br />If you have time to read, enjoy mystery, sci-fi, parallel universes and talking goats then this is definitely worth the effort.  I read this on my Kindle which made a difference.  I suspect I would have given up after a few hundred pages if I was reading it paperback; definitely wouldn't have attempted it hardcover.  This is one of the first times I felt the benefit of a kindle over traditional physical copies.<br /><br />Haruki Murakami, genius author: mad genius.

While his songs aren't bad, it just most of the songs didn't have real life issues like his previous albums as much. Crooked smile, and Born Sinner both were deep, but the rest of the stuff just felt like regular rap songs. I want him to sing deeper, like Lights Please, Dreams, Cheer Up, so  maybe his next album will be better.

B00C7JFIRC|4.0|Ever wonder what the 1939 \\"Wizard of Oz\\" would have been like if first choices W.C. Fields (as the Wizard) and an 11-year-old Shirley Temple (as Dorothy) were cast? Now we have some idea with \\"Oz the Great and Powerful,\\" the 2013 prequel. No, we don't have Dorothy. But even she might have been upstaged in a 1939 version centered on W.C. Fields. Instead, we have been spoiled by a mature-voiced Judy Garland singing her iconic \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" along with the less-intrusive Frank Morgan as the Wizard. Had the 1939 film not been so good, I think more reviewers might have enjoyed this prequel for what it is.<br /><br />James Franco, like Fields would have been, is a sleazy operator as the Wizard. He does improve as the going gets tough, but even his friends still think he will fly the coop rather than risk his life in a showdown with two wicked witches. To his credit, he uses early 20th century technology to put on a dazzling performance that wins the day for the people of Oz. Other, more endearing characters include the china girl, the flying monkey, and the chief tinker. The three witches are well played and help set up the coming remake of the \\"Wizard of Oz.\\" Add to this a lot of brilliantly colorful, Avatar-like computerized graphics and you have clean, solid entertainment.

Though there are a few episodes that if the show didn't preview the next episode at the end of the current episode I would have quit watching, I highly suggest watching more than half of the episodes. I highly recommend this show to sci-fi fans who like good, clean, adventurous fun that keeps its audience interested.
B000002C2E|5.0|In reading the reviews for this album you'll probably see a lot of reviews say that Time Out of Mind is Dylan's best since Blood on the Tracks. And for good reason. It really is his best since Blood on the Tracks.<br />Not only that, Time Out of Mind has a staying power that gets richer with every new listen. It's one of his most listenable albums from start to finish. Time Out of Mind is, at heart, a blues album. It is heavily steeped in the blues, in fact about every other track on the album is a blues song. But it's the non-blues tracks that are the real standouts. Trying to Get to Heaven Before They Close the Door and Standing in the Doorway are two of Dylan's all time best. And Not Dark Yet may be the best on the album and one of his top ten songs of all time. Really, it's that good.<br />Daniel Llanois' production adds to the album immensely. Its a very dark record. One in which we hear a man sing about his own mortality and a life filled with regret. But if we know anything about Dylan, it's that it's in these albums, one's of heart ache and loss, that Dylan shines brightest. If you don't own Time Out of Mind, you're missing out on one of Dylan's finest.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|would have given it 5 stars if it lasted longer hope there is more to come but zoomed through it in about 2 hours. I couldn't put it down though in those 2 hours :)

B00DF0POXA|1.0|I listened to all the songs on youtube and boy are they all just horrible. All the reviewers giving this anything more than 3 stars are reviewing Kanye the image and legend rather than the musical content. Convincing themselves that this is an artistic step forward for a genius of an artist. It's unlistenable. If this wasn't Kanye and the record was released with these tracks anonymously produced the album would get trashed. It sounds like background filler for a horror movie. It isn't clever and I have no idea why he thinks he is as great as he is.
B00364K6YW|4.0|Great movie (anything with Colin Firth!), however it had a section that froze. I sent it back and Amazon sent me a new one. I haven't watched it yet.

B00BBA6FOI|5.0|This book paints Sheryl's picture in a very relevant and even entertaining manner. It's an engaging read with very pertinent lessons that can be used at any stage of your career.
B00005JNJV|5.0|In this franchise reboot instigated by writer-producer-director and film magician Christopher Nolan, the dark knight is given a new face, a detailed back story, and, most of all, a newer, fresher, and darker tone. Fueled by a knockout performance by Christian Bale and a great supporting cast that includes Katie Holmes, Tom Wilkinson, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, and the magnificent Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler, Nolan's first installment in his acclaimed \\"Dark Knight\\" Trilogy set up audiences for an incredible introspective take on the character, and changed superhero movies forever.<br />I own the single-disc version of the film, which is a great package for the low price you're paying for it. It comes with no real bonus features other than the theatrical trailer, but it's fine because the film is the real gem here. While do love most of Nolan's special features (Memento's 2-Disc Edition is a masterpiece in its own right apart from the equally magnificent film), it's just such a great deal to get the single-disc version. If you feel so inclined go right ahead and buy the 2-disc version, Nolan has a way of making even the making-of documentaries on his films interesting (see the Prestige single-disc DVD for some pretty cool set designing).

B000M341QO|5.0|Winner of Four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. Featuring an ensemble of great performances including Leonardo DiCaprio as an undercover cop infiltrating thug leader Jack Nicholson's crime syndicate, a snake in the grass crooked cop Matt Damon who's on Nicholson's payroll, Martin Sheen as one of DiCaprio's handlers, and a foul-mouthed Mark Wahlburg in what is undeniably his best performance, Scorcese's 2006 crime saga is a remake of a Hong Kong-made trilogy called Infernal Affairs [[ASIN:B000LXS6H0 The Infernal Affairs Trilogy (Infernal Affairs 1 / Infernal Affairs 2 / Infernal Affairs 3) (Special Collector's Edition Box Set)]].<br /><br />At 2 hours and 31 minutes, this film is rather lengthy, but it feels about as half as long as it really is, with incredible suspense and intense scenes of violence that make Goodfellas look like the Wizard of Oz. What's really so great about this film is that it feels like it's been around for decades instead of just a few years. From the time it came out it felt like a classic, not only because of Scorcese's signature style of homage and innovation but also for the well-written script by screenwriter William Monahan.<br /><br />I own the single-disc Full Screen copy, and my only complaint with it is that it is full-screen. You really need to see this film at it's original aspect ratio to appreciate how wonderfully it is made. Buy the widescreen single disc version or the double-disc widescreen version, you'll be a lot happier. Other than that it's an incredible product![[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)]][[ASIN:B000M5AJQS The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
B0038YWPZS|5.0|Sad? Watch it. Happy? Watch it. It's one of the best movies out there. You can watch over and over again.
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|After a few singles and a very enjoyable EP released in the last few years, Charli XCX makes her major debut with True Romance, borrowing its title from the 1993 Quentin Tarantino penned Tony Scott film of the same name. It's refreshing to hear \\"pop music\\" that is so unafraid to go into some serious terrain, with the 20-year-old Brit not afraid to sing lines that may make the average listener rewind the music and ask themselves \\"Did she really say THAT?\\"<br />Tracks that stand our in particular are the darkly catchy and hauntingly beautiful \\"Stay Away\\", the slurring and sprawling \\"Grins\\", the surprisingly retro \\"So Far Away\\", and the one-two punch of opening track \\"Nuclear Seasons\\" followed by the equally catchy \\"You - Ha Ha Ha\\". Really though, all of these songs are catchy, brave, beautiful, and refreshingly independent, yet somehow fit together nicely enough to preserve the feel of an album that so many artists these days seem to be shy of achieving.<br />At times very dark yet equally beautiful, Charli XCX's first official album is a winning combination of catchy melodies, drum-bass-fuzz music characteristic of Lady Gaga or Robyn, and the singer's characteristic ballsy bravery. What really sets this album apart from her contemporaries, however, is her truthfulness and her refreshing approach to themes and lyricism. This is no ordinary \\"pop\\" album, and it's one that's going to be seen in years to come as the acknowledgement of a new yet soon to be celebrated voice.<br />Great product!
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|It is a good movie with a plot, character development, good acting and musical numbers with talented dancers and some action and suspense.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Vampire Weekend's third album, titled Modern Vampires of the City, is a bit of a game changer for the band, who decided to update their sound a bit and use different methods of music production to create a new soundscape for themselves. While not a complete makeover, there are some large surprises on the record (all of them wonderful) and add to the effect of making the album both a new approach from the band and a treat for their audience.<br />Album opener Obvious Bicycle opens with much room to breathe, featuring sparse instrumentation and decidedly calm lyrics by the band's frontman. From the first second of the opening track though, we hear a different Vampire Weekend. The band has changed, and for the better (not that their first two records weren't masterpieces in their own right). In an album full of gems, however, the band's first single Diane Young stands out as a change of style and instrumentation for the band. This album should be seen almost as a direct reaction to VP's debut eponymous album and their sophomore record Contra. The first album was a baroque pop love fest, while Contra was obviously inspired by world music, in particular that of South America. Here, Vampire Weekend makes a new sound for themselves, with nods to 80's British and American music (Joy Division and Tears for Fears are two bands that I for some reason see as influences). Influences aside, this album owes everything to the band members, who have created an album that is eerily reminiscent of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in its unified yet sprawling sound and epic quality.<br />Overall this album is perhaps Vampire Weekend's best yet, and can be said more to be a nod to to the Wes Anderson films the group obviously adore so much, at least in terms of pacing. I'm excited to see what they do next!
1401216676|5.0|Product is a must have in any Batman collectors collection. It's a good read, plus the artistry is one of a kind!!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Everything about this film is genius. The visual effects, the story, the characters, and, of course, Heath Ledger's career role as The Joker. From the moment we first see the eternally smiling villain, we are captivated by him, partly because of the way he looks and that he seemingly has no past, and partly because of the downright amazing performance by the ill-fated actor.<br /><br />Nolan himself said that Michael Mann's crime thriller Heat was a heavy inspiration on his second installment, and it's easy to see what he means. Like Mann's 1995 classic, this film has intense scenes of mayhem, violence, and peril, but what really makes them both so great is that they have so much time to breathe, to be calm before the storm. It is in these moments of quiet that hide the real intensity, and what made Nolan's trilogy so suspenseful.<br />The DVD itself is just fine, it's a bare-bones presentation of the film, with no director's commentary or special features, which is fine. While I do love most of Nolan's special features the single-disc version can't be beat because of the price. However if you so desire stepping it up to get the two-disc set just for the bonus features isn't a bad idea. Nolan has a way of making even the extra features on his DVD's pretty interesting (the Memento 2-Disc Edition is itself a masterpiece apart from the film).<br /><br />Overall, this was a great buy that I was very pleased with, as I'm a huge fan of the film! Enjoy it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun different kind of game.  There are no hints but you don't need them.  Fun and addicting......short..but was free and fun.
B003BKF6AU|5.0|From start to finish, The National's 2010 album High Violet does what the band do best. It's an emotional, calculated, and downright lovely addition to their catalog, and an album that will for years be seen as a masterpiece of soundscapes. The record's opener, Terrible Love, features driving guitar rhythm and the lead singer's characteristic baritone voice reaching for higher places, with the song slowly escalating to a pretty wonderful climax before moving on to the ever more impressive second track, the optimistic downer Sorrow, which may be the album's lyrical highlight. Anyone's Ghost utilizes a very catchy chorus, while Little Faith's greatest asset is how much room it leaves for breath. The next track, Afraid of Everyone, shows the lead singer's fears of being a new father, while Bloodbuzz Ohio's temporary glimpse into light brings the song out of darkness, if just for a second, before thrusting the listener head on into the most optimistic track on the record, Lemonworld, which is so catchy and lovely that it almost feels like a sing-a-long song. Next, the band almost makes the album with the track Runaway, with its slowly rising tension building to a calculated and slow-paced chorus that almost writes itself, before moving on to the almost chaotic Conversation 16. Finally, the album reaches its climax with the epic England, which is the high point in an album full of gems. Almost every word of this track is reminiscent of songwriting so good you'd think Lennon and McCartney would have penned it. After England, Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks acts more like an epilogue than a closing track, quietly saying good night to its listener.<br /><br />I bought this record on vinyl, and it was worth the extra money I shelled out for the it! Listening on vinyl really magnifies the beautiful and organic nature of this album, making it sound even more open yet somehow contained. Do yourself a favor and buy the vinyl version! You'll be glad you did.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood deliver very good performances as the father-n-daughter in a fractured relationship that heals ones each accepts and overcome their fears.
B00008438V|4.0|One of John Hughes' most creative films sees two high school brainiacs creating the perfect woman using technology, an event that changes their lives forever. Simultaneously the goofiest and possibly the most fun out of all of Hughes' films, Weird Science also saw a spin-off television series that is worth a look.<br />What makes this film so great is how much fun it haves, and how little it takes itself seriously. This is Hughes' goofiest film, and one of his most enjoyable to watch. While not as well done as The Breakfast Club or even Sixteen Candles, Weird Science does a good job of entertaining and making us laugh.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Unlike his recent albums, this album has less experimentation with different styles.  Instead, it is like classic Satriani stuff -- rocking guitar.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|awesome game!! it reminds me of temple run 2, except there are bad guys to shoot.<br />the graphics are great! there are lots of different environments and bad guys. the controls are easy to master, and the objectives aren't too difficult to reach. my only complaint is that is that it takes a long time to earn enough to buy new armors. (of course you can buy them with real money if you can't wait)<br />absolutely recommend, can't believe this is free!!!

B0045NDVFE|5.0|I just recently heard about this band and checked out some of their songs before buying the album.  What talent!  Kimberly's voice has amazing range, and the three siblings harmonize beautifully. Whether singing the mournful &#34;If I Die Young&#34; or the uplifting &#34;All Your Life,&#34; this group shines.  Anyone who likes &#34;modern&#34; country music, strong vocals, and catchy lyrics should check out this album.  It's a keeper.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers keeps us entertained!! I play it almost every single day. I like that you can connect to Facebook and see what place you and your friends are in
B00DF0POXA|5.0|This album is way out there in terms of its creativity.  Also, Mr. West paints very vivid pictures of his seemingly invincible lifestyle.  They're definitely not for the faint of heart, especially when references to street substances are copiously mentioned.<br /><br />I could not describe it upon first listen, but it's definitely a work of art.<br /><br />Also, I both love and hate that there are only 10 tracks.  I just wanted so much more at the end.  But at the same time, I understand the concept of leaving out on top.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I thought that the blu ray version is so much improved quality than the original movie and that is cool with the documentaries
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this game. It reminds me of the fair. I still play this game at the fair when I go, this is just a little better because I don't have to play with real money. Brings out the kid in me. Just wish it had more coins to play with.

B00D3V5V7U|4.0|Ozzy and Black Sabbath reunite for their first studio album since 1978.<br />Honestly, it took a few plays for &#34;13&#34; to grow on me.<br />These songs initially sounded forced to my ears, like the band tried too hard to reproduce their early sound without pushing the envelope any further than they have in the past.<br />You can hear the influence of classic Tony Iommi guitar riffs from &#34; &#34;N.I.B.,&#34; &#34;War Pigs,&#34; and &#34;Black Sabbath&#34; on new tracks like &#34;Loner,&#34; &#34;Age of Reason,&#34; and &#34;The End of the Beginning.&#34;<br />While the riffs on &#34;13&#34; are good, I never experienced the warm euphoric feeling like when I first heard the intro of &#34;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,&#34; &#34;Symptom of the Universe,&#34; or &#34;After Forever.&#34;<br />Then again, it can be difficult to top the greatest guitar riffs of all-time when you already wrote them.<br />Geezer Butler is still amazing on bass.<br />It is great to hear Iommi jam out on the 7- and 8-minute tracks.<br />Ozzy's voice is fine on &#34;13,&#34; not washed up like some have suggested.<br />After I finished crying about missing Bill Ward on drums, I was able to admit that Brad Wilk keeps the band's original feel in tact. Although I wonder why Black Sabbath opted for Wilk over the super-talented touring drummer, Tommy Clufetos. I think that was Rick Rubin's doing.<br />In the end, I am very happy that Black Sabbath is back in business. &#34;13&#34; still beats everything else that's out these days.
B003L16FAE|5.0|I have the Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu Ray of this. I don't know if this is the same transfer as the version the angry circa-2008 edition that has so many angry 1-star reviews here, but mine looks fine. Yes, there is grain. This is a gritty film, literally and figuratively -- my god, that shot where Arnold cliff-dives off the waterfall looks (and has always looked) like it was shot on 8mm in low light on a humid evening sometime in the 1960s, then developed in a sawdust factory. Until the Smithsonian recognizes Predator as the significant piece of filmmaking history it is, a true frame-by-frame artisanal restoration of of the original film is unlikely. This is the best Predator will probably ever look. And I had no problem with what some reviewers see as fake-looking faces or movements in this digital restoration.<br /><br />Everyone just needs to step back and appreciate what John McTiernan did with this film. The pacing, storytelling, interesting-but-unobtrusive camera work. And most importantly, the relative lack of hand-holding in the narrative. Look at McTiernan's trifecta of ahead-of-their-times masterpieces: Predator, Die Hard, Hunt For Red October. All three let subtle clues tell very important parts of the story, without beating you over the head with them. And for my money, each of those three remain the pinnacle of the genres they redefined (Sci-Fi, Action, Spy/Thriller).<br /><br />I hope when John McTiernan gets out of prison, the Hollywood machine allows him to make films like this again. No one else seems to be able to.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This release is clearly the best heavy metal album of 2013 hands down!!!  Just get it already! The argument right now is whether this is the best album of their career altogether?

First off, there are a TON of adds popping up and they want you to buy gems. Second, I think it would be Easy to just press a button to add someone just like in roblox. Recommend they do that AND I recommend  you put on parental settings so u don't accidentally hit 1 cuz if u do, your out of lick but other than that fun. Plz add me, treepig49 is my name.

B00B4804KS|3.0|I would have rated this a 5 but my Blu Ray disk wasn't encoded in 7.1 as advertised. The SubWoofer part was missing from the encoding. At first I thought it was my setup, but all other movies have huge explosion sounds, so it was the disk.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|I enjoy this record from a production stand-point. Lyrically, the album is borderline brain-damaged. How old is this guy? 35, 40? Isn't it time to look outside himself? All he talks about is his inflated tabloid persona, which comes across as paranoid and dumb.<br /><br />Pitchfork's 9.5 review was sycophantic to say the least. 9.5? Sweet Jesus.<br /><br />To me, this sounds like an easy listening version of Death Grips. That is to say, Death Grips shellacked with candy floss. The record might sound abrasive to an audience reared on radio music, but for anyone who listens to left-of-the-dial stuff, you've heard all of this before. Some of the sounds are interesting, as are some of the beats, and I like the energy of the delivery, despite nothing of real substance being behind the angst.<br /><br />He should listen to some EL-P. Now, that's a relevant group. Here, West is taking many of his cues from others.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I have always been a fan of Cirque du Soleil and have seen every show in Las Vegas and a few traveling ones. This DVD has some of the best parts of those shows and blends them together with a new &#34;storyline&#34;. Beautiful to watch
193700788X|1.0|This was a disappointing book.  Eric should have ended up with the girl that is obvious - no believable chemistry with Sam.  Otherwise just an aweful burdensome read.  Shame, shame, shame on you for dumping on your fans Ms. Harris.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|This little gadget that the doctor carries around with him is pretty nifty with the pen and all on it.The reviews people give it are rubbish and my pens were not dried up and the batteries were very easy to install and there were no loose pieces on it that looked even remotely like they would fall off. The lights and sounds were just like in the tv show and the whole thing is pretty well accurate.The ultraviolet light on it is the best part not only for writing secret messages but for seeing other things that can only be seen in ultraviolet light.Of course mine was the most recent and newest version before the eleventh doctors screwdriver as well.Be sure if you intend on buying one that it is the most recent sonic screwdriver that doesn't come with the psychic paper.
B008G3N71W|1.0|Thank goodness I got this for free. If I'd paid money for this degradation, I'd be horrified.<br />I love (LOVE) smutty romance. This is not that.<br />I read about 8 chapters before I couldn't take any more. In that time, the main character had submitted to being beaten, whipped, urinated on, and spit on.<br />I do not find humiliation erotic. If that's your thing- this is your book. But if it's not, don't waste your time or money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. No time limits, no hints, gets more challenging as you go. Much like 100 floors but less math so far and that's a good thing! Please make more levels :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really great game. It is even better because you have no hints and it really makes you have to think. Can't wait for the updates
0345529057|5.0|You cant beat the price on this! i would say that if you want to have this on your book shelf for years get the hardcover editions, but these are great for travelling or reading while commuting
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think Subway Surfers is a very addicting but fun game. I love to play Subway Surfers, and try to beat my friend's scores. I hope you get this game, because I know you will love it. :)
0553801473|5.0|Not much to say that hasnt been said that is, if you like the overall story, of course this is a must, the physical book itself is big and sturdy, for a bookshelf and collection,not something to be traveled with. I personally cant wait for the next book
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Love this app, I have used it for years,  perfect next to the bed or on the desk with phone in dock,  knock you rite out if your in need if some white noise to get to sleep
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't believe so many people are mad there is going to be another book.  I was so happy to find that out.  I'm glad this book wasn't the last book of the Crossfire series.  I can't wait for more of Gideon and Eva.  Thank you Sylvia Day for giving us more.<br /><br />Wow, just when I thought I couldn't love Gideon more this book just proved me wrong.  I loved this book and I hope the next book is just as good.  I like the strength of their love.  I love how they live and breathe for one another and can't seem to survive without each other.<br /><br />I like the trust they put in one another even though they seem to have one problem after another. They defiantly don't have drama free lives and it seems to come at them in all angles with everyone in their lives.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva both go out of their way to prove their love for one another.  This book shows that love can conquer all; you just have to be willing to adapt and accept people for who they are and where they come from.  You can't change ones past or who they are, you can only go on as one and hope your love is enough to hold on.  To me that's what they give to each other enough love to keep going even when there seems to be no more hope.<br /><br />This book is full of amazing surprises and I would suggest not only this book but this series to anyone.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Thoughts on this game are great. Love the different types of challenges for the hidden object part. Great time waster too. Don't like how you have to pay for things though to continue the game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game.  It gets you thinking.  Not too hard but not super easy either. Hope they add more to it!
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|I was pretty surprised to see that this advertised product is probably a counterfeit.<br />The only indication that it's BluRay is a piece of printed cardboard that is laid over the container.<br />It fell off once the cellophane was removed.<br />No where else is there any reference to this movie being BluRay.<br />And the video quality shows it.<br />It is either a very poor transfer or it's nothing but a fake.<br />At the start of the movie there is a 2 second screen shown that says something about it being HD, but nothing about BluRay.<br />The color is rendered worse than an old Laser Disc I also own.<br />If you still want to buy this, be prepared to be disappointed in the quality. It's no better than the regular DVD.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great story lines. Couldn't put it down. Always lots of twists and turns that make this a fast paced read.
0345410025|5.0|I absolutely love this Memory Book and have given this book as a gift to many friends, who all were so grateful.<br /> I was so angry after I learned this system, angry that I had not been taught any of this as a child who was super smart but unknowingly had ADD and no innate memorizing skills and so I had poor grades.  I believed I was \\"lazy and stupid\\" (my teachers and siblings description) into my 40's. I had struggled in school my whole life, except for math which doesn't require memorization and can be figured out and understood. I am visual and creative so art was easy also but I failed languages and history and anything that required rote memory.<br />At age 39 I went back to school to learn Traditional Chinese Medicine to become a Licensed Acupuncturist and Herbalist. It took a lot of hard work, long hours and I did mostly A's except for Chinese Herbalism which was like learning chemistry in Chinese (I'm not Asian). It was the hardest subject for most students because you couldn't figure it out, you had to just memorize the enormous amount of rote data.  After 4 years of study I was preparing to take my State Board exams for licensing, studying 12 to 14 hours a day because most people don't pass it the first time and financially I had to.  A friend gave me this book and it took courage to stop studying and read it instead.  I took a whole weekend, read each chapter, and practiced and mastered that before I went on to the next chapter. Harry Loraine doesn't teach you how to memorize Chinese Herbs, but he teaches you how to MEMORIZE!  I then had to figure out how to apply his techniques to Chinese Herbs. Using creativity and visual images I created a system that was funny (you can become Stephen Spielberg,or the cartoonist Gary Larson, or Tim Burton, etc.) and efficient.  I learned more herbs in the next 3 months than I had learned in the past 3 years!! And with a fraction of the time, and a fraction of the stress! Half of the time I was laughing out loud doing it because my images were so funny. Most importantly IT STUCK.  And I passed my Boards handily, the first time.<br />I cannot recommend this book enough. Please give this book to all elementary or high school kids to save them from heartache and trouble. Especially problem kids, but even top students.  It is a life saver, a stress reducer, a money maker, a health improver, an enormous time saver, and a self-esteem rescuer.  It simply makes learning a pleasure.
0735327793|3.0|Based on many positive reviews, I bought this puzzle for my two year old daughter (The recommended age for this puzzle is 3-5yrs old, but my daughter has been putting together 60 piece puzzle by herself, so I thought this would be appropriate for her) The puzzle is very beautiful, but I was disappointed in the way the puzzle pieces are cut.  When you pick up the pieces, many times there are no way to tell what you are holding, so you have to go by the shape rather than the picture to put it together.  Eg. one piece has just a colorful dot - with just this information, you cannot visually look for the next piece since it is not a continuation of a picture. You either have to consult the picture on the box to see which dot comes next, or try out each piece until you happen to come across the shape that fits the piece (which is my daughter's method).<br /><br />Similarly, the body part of the caterpillar is cut in such a way that you are looking at a green puzzle piece that all looks similar except for the different cut. No way to tell whether you are holding the caterpillar's neck, back, tail or the belly. So the way to complete this puzzle is mainly to work from the corner/side and find the pieces that fit each other by shapes.  While my daughter can complete the puzzle, this is not my (nor my daughter's) favorite.  I prefer puzzle pieces that when you pick up, you can tell what part of the picture you are holding and visually look for the next piece.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Beautiful shiny surface with brilliant color<br />- Nice thick cardboard pieces (about 2mm thick) that is durable but not hard to put together or pull apart<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Abstract picture.  Except for the face of the caterpillar and the fruits, you have to put the puzzle together by the shape rather than the picture.<br /><br />I bought this puzzle a little cheaper at Barnes & Nobles for $11.95 (instead of the current Amazon price of $15.99).<br />I have bought puzzles by Ravensburger, Melissa & Doug, Mudpuppy and Kumon but our all time favorite is Briarpatch's \\"The Good Night Moon\\" puzzle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is really fun and addictive.  my daughter and I enjoy playing this together!  I will recommend this to my friends!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Easy to use, gives good info<br />I downloaded it as a free app of the day and it's very helpful, especially when I was traveling because it gave usage time as well as battery level.
B0041D843M|5.0|Just wish I had read this comprehensive nutritional study years ago.  Also now wish my parents would have raised me this this study in mind.  Wish I had known about this for my kids' sake too.  I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this app it is so much fun i play it with all of my friends they all love it so i think you should buy it is free so get it
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I love it it is the best game I have that has a car to drive so get it it is cool
0375869026|5.0|I read \\"Wonder\\" so I could discuss with my daughter who was assigned the book for school.  I was engrossed and recommend this to all ages, the challenges and lessons transcend age, this is a story filled with developed characters and humanity.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Engrossing!!  Intellectually stimulating.  Reminds me of Myst. Has a spooky existential quality. I must admit I have become an immediate fan and I'm only on level 4.
0670014893|1.0|Difficult read but very compelling; until the ending. What happened to the ending? Some people describe this as profound. I describe it as unfulfilling.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is great but don't  buy catch the candy that is a copyright of<br />this game don't buy  that crap.
1603400265|5.0|It has pictures and larger print which makes it easier for these grandmother to read with a ten year old.  This is his first novel he has read - sort of finds it boring, but it is a classic.
B004XISI4A|5.0|And now we wait for book 6 , so many characters to keep up with. Waiting to see what happens with little finger and sansa.
B005HSL626|4.0|this app is so cool and I am a fruit lover myself and when I saw this app ky love for fruit went higher than ever
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i am up to level five and so far its a cool game. challenging. But not incredibly hard that they cant be solved.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|IF you have even one prejudiced bone in your body...I urge you to watch THIS movie. The Boy in the Stripped Pajamas is a shocker and a wake up call for all. xoxoxo's
0393057658|5.0|Michael Lewis is a very compelling writer;  I believe I will read everything he writes.  He has the ability to bring the people he writes about to life, whether they be bankers or baseball players.  I happened to see the very fine film &#34;Moneyball&#34; prior to ordering the book,( OK, I actually saw the film 5 times since I love baseball)  and that was just the right order to do so, since the book has a great deal of information not found in the film.  I enjoy baseball books,and have read most of the better ones available, but I believe this is the very best.  Highly informative, highly entertaining and a real &#34;page turner&#34; as well.
B002ZG997C|5.0|We should all walk with THAT much \\"faith\\" in our hearts and in our minds! xoxoxox's One of THE best movies in our library!
B000FBJAOG|1.0|Not at all like world war z. Just goes on and on like instructions for setting up a stereo. Stopped reading after two chapters. Not worth the money at all. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed it and would have given it five stars if there were more levels.  I hope more are added soon.
B00846REIS|5.0|The book was an easy read and I c wouldn't put it down. It definitely kept me guessing! I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. its a lot of fun and wont bore you. I really have a hard time getting good puzzle games but I like this one
B004ZNB12O|1.0|Can't believe that not one song from \\"Obscured by clouds\\" in on this cd.<br />The song \\"The Gold is in the...\\" should be played on the radio, but for some reason it's not.<br />If you are a fan of Pink Floyd do yourself a favor and buy their collection. Also get their solo stuff as well.<br />I'm only want to see how much better they are after being remastered, and I'll find out as soon as I get my copy from my local library.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Excellent story!... I was so hoping that this story wouldn't end just yet...so thrilled there will be a book 4!!!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|While not the first book in the series, this is the first book I have read and I really enjoyed.  From the many reviews of this book and others in the series, I am not alone.  Rounded characters, satisfying plot, not a teaser, not everything at once but the progression is natural and I did not feel &#34;cheated&#34;  with an &#34;out of the blue&#34; ending.  I did not guess it but I did feel it.  I also like that I could enjoy this book on its own without the background of having read the others (though I bought two more).
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. You need a lot of time or a lot of money. The graphics are great.
B005ERX1Z0|5.0|These are things I love in a movie nonscence, comedy, slapstick, car chases, beautiful women, Burt Reynolds, karate, 007, the rat pack, all of those are in this movie blended up and thrown in your face. just the out takes at the end is worth the price of this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyed this book immensely. Can't recommend it enough. Can't wait to read the other books in the series as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A little short but promises to add more levels in the future. Can't wait to see the new rooms and challenges! Fun free game.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoy the story to this game. I have played several similar games but this one has one of the best stories. The hidden object games and mini-games are pretty cool too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice lil ap a bit short but not too easy or too hard. Glad it was free cuz I'd . Like more levels before I pay for it
B00BKTFABE|3.0|Great so you can go right to the camera part of the kindle it is free so why<br />Not get it
1439152802|4.0|This is the first book by Kate Morton that I've read.  I did like the story but felt as the middle of the book really dragged.  My rating should really be a 3 1/2.  Ms. Morton did a great job with the character analysis and pulled you in with her knowledge of the war experience for the average citizen during the air raids, etc.  There is a mystery to this story, one that I thought I had figured out but oh there was much more than I presumed.  I couldn't quit reading until I finished.  Great ending!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love this game similar to diamond quest but alot better personally. I love opening new levels and new jewels. Can become addicting
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|Others may disagree but to me Zep IV is the standout album from the group.  Even considering the way radio stations overplayed Stairway To Heaven, the tune still stands proud as a pinnacle of Zep's talent.  Also, in the early days of DJ's and hip-hop the beginning drum beat of When The Levee Breaks was &#34;the&#34; riff for DJ's to crank up loud and get the audience going.<br /><br />There isn't a bad song on this album.  A 'must have&#34; for any Zep fan!
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|i hate that the board ends after the last pig dies even if the destruction of additional objects is still tabulating. fix please
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game, wish there was more rooms to escape from. You can't go wrong with a great game for free.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game it makes me think sometimes I need hints but it a fun game I have other games like this.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|started off slow not very good direction, but once you start clicking on things it starts to connect together and you canfigure more out
B00APUYWYA|5.0|basically the best movie ever made. i thought it was going to be crazy lame but i am in love with every single character and everything about this movie. Fabulous.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|games pretty fun. plus its free.if you like these kind of games you'll like this one.so download this app right away
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The graphics of this game are amazing.I love temple run oz. You go to the land of oz, winkie country and the dark forest I would totally recommend this game for anyone!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|best game little short but awsesome all of my friends and family love it everybody should get it I love it
B00BESM14U|4.0|I love when movies stick to the book and this one did a great job of that.  I thought the casting was well done and the performances sincere.  I recommend for young people especially!
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|If you like Arnie, add a star or two.  I judge movies by whether or not I fall asleep.  Eyes wide open all the way.  Too bad he was Govenor all those years, could have been putting out more of these gems instead.  Fun all the way.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I rented this after seeing it in the theatre because it was so good.  I rented it to watch with my family and my dad (just turned 80) loved it!  Great performances, great love story.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Rock of Ages is certainly one of the guiltiest pleasures.  It is cheesy, stereotypical and who has a course of bus passengers who act as your backup singers.  It's a wonderfully funny satire that is way over the top and very well acted.  For an evening of laughs, great fun and well done rock'n roll you cannot beat this movie.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This CPU compliments my Black series MB & my AMD graphics card along with my SSD, the stock cooling works as it should, but if  you intend to overclock you should consider better cooling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the game I will never forget because it gives u a good time to have when u r board
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this show! I'm glad I had the option to purchase just one episode because i didn't need the whole season!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'm so excited for my sister to try this cool app!!<br /><br />I've been having so much fun with this. It's addicting, everyone should try it!
B005XN31LY|5.0|Love this show! I'm glad I had the option to purchase just one episode because i didn't need the whole season!
B00BYISQTO|5.0|When you have a wife you love, sometimes you come home and she has a new outfit and a new haircut and its like being married to a brand new woman. That is what \\"Trouble Will Find me,\\" is.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|What a great journey you are taken on in this book. I think all of us go through these stages of exploring ourselves and this beautifully written tale takes you through all the emotions and discoveries of life. Well done!
0062255657|5.0|Many of Neil's characters are versions of myths, so here too with the Hemstock women. At least they feel like certain mythological beings, what with all the snipping and threads and such. Of course they're not. They're versions.<br /><br />I could not have loved this book so well if I had not first read Neil's wife, Amanda Palmer's blog post/review of it. It's here http://amandapalmer.net/blog/20130618/ I think you should definitely read it too. It makes the book make sense. It makes me love all the little pieces of this story that come from real life.<br /><br />I don't think this would be the best book for a newcomer to Neil Gaiman's work to start with. It's quite short, and might be a bit of a let down, if you don't already know and love Gaiman's cadence, style, and motifs. Neverwhere was my introduction, and after that I voraciously started reading everything he had written. (I *think* there is a little nod-off to Neverwhere in here, in which he states \\"A door is a dangerous thing to be.\\")<br /><br />I was surprised to have finished it in the span of an evening. I might wish that it could have been longer, but I think it's the perfect length for the story that it is. It was beautiful and sad and uplifting and otherworldly and distinctly Gaiman.<br /><br />And I'm about to go hear him read excerpts (!!! my heart!!! LOVE Neil's reading voice) and signy sign books on Thursday!!! :D
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Very well put together. I liked all the music on this CD. I like to use it to exercise to.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Downloaded to my Fire HD.  Every time I started to see how the app worked, I'd get a notification it stopped working.  After the 4th or 5th time, I just deleted it.  It might be great if it worked.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitely check it out this app. It will keep you busy while you're passing time. You won't regret trying it.
B00C7JG0KG|2.0|Only ONE disc is included in the package. Movie only. No other extras of any kind.<br /><br />The 3D quality was lackluster. A few shots within a scene would have good 3D depth but other shots seemed flat. If I paused the movie, the frame lost its 3D appearance. I have never had that happen with another video. The first views of the Emerald City looked like it was painted on a large canvas. No 3D depth at all. Mila Kunis' character seemed unemotional even when saying &#34;the prophecy is true&#34;. She did improve later on in the film. There were many blatant violations of the Laws of Physics. I do not mean things like flying critters and such. I do not want to spoil the plot but several things happen that would require people to be visible to the &#34;enemy&#34; prior to them &#34;surprising the enemy&#34;. Also, a projected image on a screen/cloud cannot &#34;see&#34; someone moving in front of them. So the projected person looking down to their left would not be able to see the movement, yet the character interacts as if they ARE seeing what is happening in front of their face. This is commonly done on TV shows with a person on a laptop screen seemingly &#34;looking&#34; at people to one side of the computer as if the they could see them. They can only see where the camera is aimed. In this occurance, people standing all around the cloud screen are seeing exactly the same image no matter where they are relative to the projector. That can't even happen with a hologram much less traditional movie projection.<br /><br />There was a lot of talk of killing as if it was no big deal. Characters eagerly joined up without understanding why the intended victim SHOULD be killed. There were a couple of funny moments but the major theme was of impending doom and annihilation. I never understood what caused the feud between the Main characters in the first place. But obviously killed people was the ONLY solution. As in the Batman Movies, OZ the Great and Powerful is starkly different  from the original Wizard of OZ. The original Batman TV show and Wizard of Oz were fun, happy and comical. Their Movie incarnations are dark, dreary and full of evil. I long for the days of happy characters having fun and adventures on the big screen. Positive role models. Children that actually learned life lessons from their parents and other adults. I may sell this one back to Amazon. I have no desire to see it ever again. This is a first. I have over 70 3D titles and commonly watch them again and again.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Received in great time.  Love this movie, have not watched the DVD yet, but saw it at the movies and had to have it.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|this a very sturdy, compact camera case.  it comes with shoulder strap.  it has an unusual, but interesting shape and design (to fit camera with large lenses) with narrowing, reinforced base. it won't handle much more than small accessories though.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great Chess program for beginners through experts.  The fact that it is free makes it even better.  I recommend this game highly.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Great read! I love Bourdain!!! Been meaning to read this book for a while. I can now safely say he is my hero!!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It's really hard to find a good book. I saw this one day a year ago and put it on the list. So glad I did it's wonderful eagerly awaiting the sequel!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|No initial helpful instructions or tutorials, but once you figure it out its a whole lot of fun. A little frustrating when you touch screen to look at something closely and it won't let you because it's not \\"supposed to be looked at\\". I wish it would zoom in on everything you look at even if it has no value for the level.
034580404X|2.0|No plot, not erotic. Just 2 people that have kinky sex and fight and have sex and fight...over and over. It provides a good case against unconditional love. The interplay between the 2 people was somewhat interesting. That gave it the 2 stars...otherwise, a 1 star.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|This was one of my demo LP's back when I sold High End audio in NY back in the early 70's. I have since switched over to CD's due to all my moving around I had over 2000 LP's and they just got to be too much to move all the time. Besides my old copy was scratched and had a lot of surface noise and pops. I didn't get back into LP's because of the cost to do so. Anyways this Deluxe 2 disc set, 1 disc remixed from the master tape has 3 audio formats superbly Re-mixed by Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree, the other a digital remix that contains the original release. there is no comparison to the master tape remix. I like the enhanced stereo version best, my self. Tank which is missing ( One of my favorite cuts ) because the original master tape was either damaged or missing is a loss but it's now one of my own demo CD's. Its kind of interesting to hear the 2 versions of &#34;Take a Pebble&#34;, another one of my favorites. Its so much quieter with out all the LP surface noise that you can pick up so much more detail than ever before that its scary. Vinyl lovers will hate my statement on that, but really give it a listen, absolutely superb. This is THE best audio version I can ever remember hearing of this fantastic recording, Super Highly Recommended!
0451450523|4.0|I thought this book was a very good book.  It is full of fantasy.  I do recommend it to anyone interested.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Other reviewers raved about this app, but for a new player it comes with no instructions, tips, or hints. So, while it does have some fun music, I am not loving it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|There is something about AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED that makes me think about Thomas Hardy, my favorite late nineteenth century novelist. A single radical decision at the very beginning drives all the characters to an inevitable denouement. Their several journeys are long, complicated, interesting in themselves, skillfully set out, but that they will converge is never in doubt.  This is a quieter, more personal novel than the shattering KITE RUNNER, with ample opportunity to get get to know a variety of interesting and very real people. It reads best in large doses.
B003R0MF5S|5.0|Its one of the best seasons of the best T.V. series in the history of Television ever. Nothing screams Nemesis like Volkov Industries.
1572816295|5.0|Such a beautiful deck, the paper isn't too glossy and the art tells a story. Because the images are so detailed, I don't need to refer to my book of tarot definitions so much! The characters are so whimsical and flamboyant, each card was created with alot of depth and meaning. I'm going to sit here all night flipping through each card! Thank you for creating such beautiful art and making it accessible through amazon :)
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|WoW this show is one of the best out there, they did really good job with tying everthing in and i loved the ending of season 3 and the begining of season 4. If your still not sure about this series then i suggest you buy season 1 and just watch the pilot episode and if your not hooked in the first 5 minutes then I dont know what to tell you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I Can't wait to see the movie and to read the 3rd book.  I'm going to start reading right now!
B001DHXT6G|4.0|It looks really cool but the disks can be a pain with the way the sleeves are set up.  if you like the series then its a definite buy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think. However, it was not so difficult that I felt foolish and had to look up the answers. I can't wait for more levels.
B00005NGAL|5.0|This item will keep your interest from start to finish. Every age group will love it. This is the second one I have bought for my granddaughter.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is short, but it is fun. It isn't very hard, but it isn't very easy either.  I was able to do the puzzles without feeling frustrated and giving up like some other games I'ved played.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the game it is hard, but not too hard. Makes you think to figure it, but with a little thought you can figure it out.
0440237688|5.0|I started reading this book as I am a substitute and was subbing in a classroom that was reading this book. I liked what I had read so I had to buy the book so I could read the whole thing. I then also borrowed the books that follow in the series from that teacher.
B004KKXMSI|4.0|These are three fun movies to watch and having all three together makes for a good addition to any DVD collection.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Very intense.  Because of the subject matter, difficult to watch, but an excellent movie.  The direction, acting, music, and all other aspects of this movie were first rate.  Definitely not for younger children.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A few different people recommended this book to me awhile ago, so I purchased it, but I have not read it until now. I don't know why I haven't read it sooner! I could not put it down. Sweet Enzo is so wise and his story is told so well. I'm ready to read the whole book over right now! This is a must-read for all types!
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I purchased the sticker pad for my granddaughter who loves stickers because these can be repositioned easily, unlike regular stickers.  Even though there are some small pieces they are not too difficult for her to use.  They also seem to be holding up well to small fingers tugging to separate the items.
159463176X|5.0|It is a must read for any fan of 'The Kite Runner' or &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns.&#34; Don't Expect the same style, but it's still amazingly created
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Absolutely thrilling and suspenseful the entire way through.  You feel connected and rooting for the characters, most of them at least.  Marvin's delivery and trickery keeps you reading hoping each moment is either true or a horrid prank.  Either way, there is nothing disappointing about this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's so awesome and their are slot more gadgets it's way better than the first one and it has people trust me you'll love it it's so cool thanks for reading love the choice
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love his game it is very addicting!!(: I'm very pleased with the results of this game me and my sitter both downloaded it it can be very tricky at times though.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I liked the first book a lot, but I absolutely loved \\"The Elite\\". This is story writing at it's best. For me a good book is something I can loose myself in and forget about the world around me and its problems. This book did that for me, I couldn't put it down. There were some surprises in this book that were unexpected and I'm excited to see where the story goes from here.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />America stays true to herself and her beliefs. She doesn't care if it's proper or expected behavior when it comes to what she feels is right.<br />America, Maxon and Aspen all have made mistakes whose consequences they have to live with, but they also learn from them.<br />America finds out what the reason behind the rebel attacks may be.<br />We finally get to see King Clarksons true colors.<br />Mary, Anne and Lucy. They remain completely loyal and true friends to America. I love them!<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />Her indecisiveness between Maxon and Aspen. It seems to be that she favors whomever she's with at the moment. I hope she sticks with the choice she makes at the end of the book and doesn't change her mind again in the next one.<br />Aspen, I really started despising him in this book. He keeps telling America things about Maxon that he really doesn't know, since he doesn't know the guy.<br />King Clarkson, he's humanity at its worst!!! I hope he gets put in his place in the next book.<br /><br />My favorite quote:<br />(Exchange between Marlee and America)<br />She sighed. \\"I give up. Sorry, America, you've been so patient, but I hate hearing myself play. It sounds like the piano is sick.\\"<br />\\"More like it's dying actually.\\"<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book. I can't wait to find out how the story ends and how America solves her current dilemmas.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is very addicting! I like that you really have to use your brain to solve each puzzle. Lots of fun!
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|This game is addicting and very fun! As it is a challenge. I wish it wasn't $1.99 though. Because it is kind of short. But very fun.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I read the reviews on this before I read it, that was my mistake. It's just more to their crazy love life. I'm actually glad that the story continues.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|In a day when many novels seem to almost be written from a similar outline, this story was different.  It is a gothic romantic tale, and bears some similarities to other books of this nature.  But it is also fresh and surprising...intriguing and interesting.  A very enjoyable read.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this app every night on my Kindle Fire. I love that you can set a timer and combine a variety of sounds. You can even set the individual volumes on your custom mix to get the sounds just how you like.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|Loved the movie and was very happy with the quality of the DVD. Great sound and image quality. Definately worth the $5 or so it cost me.
B00AEFY66U|4.0|I haven't watched this yet because I want to finish reading the book first since I haven't read it in quite a few years.  Whether it's a great adaptation or not doesn't matter because I'll have my students write a review either way!  I haven't seen other movie adaptations to even compare, so I have more work to do, too.
B008966SI0|5.0|A friend of mine introduced the band to me. I went to the São Paulo´s concert and there is not vinyl for sale so I ordered it in Amazon. Must have for new and old musicians and music lovers.<br /><br />Hope to watch their concert again soon.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is easy enough that you will not be frustrated and difficult enough that it isn't boring. The puzzles have altar pieces that must be freed to win the level. If you don't manage to get them to the bottom where they can fall out you must redo the level. There are also time bonuses and various smash tile bonuses to free which can help to finish a level if time is running out. This is a game you can replay again and again without losing interest.
B0055S348W|5.0|I like that you can test the app before spending the money for the app. Good support. Makes my Kindle Fire that much better. $13 for a good app is small price to pay for greater productivity. Well done.

B004QL7K8E|2.0|So I thought this would be a good way to spend a Saturday night evening, but halfway through the movie I wanted to end it. The acting was horrible as well as the entire plot of the movie. This is a typical teenager coming of age movie where parents leave for the weekend and the kid has a house party that gets out of control. The acting is beyond horrible to describe the annoying characters for this movie including all the wild antics portrayed which by the way is a bit over the top. The movie is shot in first person much like those low budget Blair Witch project flicks from the past. Overall if you have absolutely nothing to do or are bored out of your mind view it otherwise I'd ditch this at all cost. Glad I didn't pay full price to actually see this. Good attempt at a classic teenager movie set in the current time however poorly executed.

B002HJ9PTO|2.0|It didn't work the way I wanted it to.<br />I wanted to use it for a violin pick up, using an adaptor I plugged it into a practice amp first and it worked good.<br />But when I got it to church and plugged it into my mixing board I had to turn the volume almost all the way up and it<br />made a loud hissing sound, I could hear the violin but the hissing sound was unbearable, So I found another way to mic<br />the violin using something else.<br /><br />I believe the reason why the mic didn't work is because the plug on it is stereo and needs to be mono.<br />I don't know way it worked in the practice amp and not the mixing board.

B00D6OV57O|5.0|Note: I have not yet seen the movie.<br /><br />Academy Award winning composer Hans Zimmer steps in for John Williams to write a new score for a new Superman movie, and the question is, can Mr. Zimmer deliever, as he did with The Lion King, The Rock, The Prince Of Egypt, and the Pirates Of The Carribbean & The Dark Knight trilogies? After all, Mr. Williams wrote what many, myself included, consider to be the definitive score for what will always be the greatest Superman film ever made, SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE.<br /><br />The answer is a resounding YES. Mr. Zimmer delivers once again, crafting a score that is very reminiscent in tone to The Dark Knight Trilogy. There's anger, pain, loss, angst, fierce fighting, love, hate, revenge. Everything that comprised The Dark Knight Trilogy is present in tone here, which is appropriate, considering that David S. Goyer, co-writer of Batman Begins & co-story writer of The Dark Knight, wrote the treatment & screenplay for this new film. Christopher Nolan, the brilliant mastermind behind The Dark Knight movies, produces this motion picture, so it is absolutely appropriate that Mr. Zimmer deliver something reminiscent of his excellent work on the previous three BATMAN movies, which, in my opinion, blow Burton/Schumacher's Caped Crusader movies right out of the water and into movie hell.<br /><br />There is no reason to compare Mr. Zimmer & Mr. Williams' scores, as both scores are a product of the films they were written for, and as far as I've read some of the spoiler-free reviews on the new movie, this one is very very very different from SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, which is a lighthearted, but serious and respectful, take on Joe Siegel & Jerry Shuster's comic book creation. Enjoy both scores for what they are, and enjoy both movies as separate entities.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|I downloaded this app today because it was the &quot;free app of the day&quot; and I got very confused, I don't get the point of this app when all you see are wall papers and hear not so soothing music. Why do you need to open an app to see all of this? Why can't the kindle just have wall papers you can pick and make your own? That is exactly why I'm getting an iphone  because I'm sick of having apps that no one heard of and always last to get the updates. I mean really Amazon needs to step up their game or their losing and customer and its not going to be pretty not at all...
B0053JJLLC|1.0|I guess the author thought cramming a bunch of trivia about bugs into this book would make it feel more weighty.<br /><br />It didn't work.<br /><br />This book has all the ambience and weight of a 1970s Saturday morning cartoon.  The characters are washed out, two dimensional, stereotypical people you could not care less about.  The plot is boilerplate, and the story is chock full of holes.<br /><br />Additionally, the author asks you to go a bridge too far in the suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Horrible, horrible book.

B002AS466O|5.0|One of the best Willis/Silver collaborations.  One of the best Silver/Shane Black collaborations.  One of the best buddy movies ever.  One of Tony Scott's best.  One of the best films of the 90s.  Smart plot, witty banter, gratuitous violence.  Willis on top form, Scott directs the hell out of it giving the whole thing a late afternoon LA smog look.  Great soundtrack by Michael Kamen.  Everything about the film works and it still holds up 20 years later.<br />I don't know why this film wasn't a hit on release.  Too violent perhaps?  Shame we never got the sequel CRY ME A RIVER.<br />Bluray is nicely cleaned up.  VHS and DVD versions were faded and worn out looking, this cleaned up nicely, sharp colours and crisp sound.  Worth buying- and you get LAST MAN STANDING for free- SCORE!
B00D41H2PS|3.0|The game was good in that it was well drawn and you couldn't get &quot;lost&quot;. The puzzles themselves weren't hard at all but finding the clues sometimes frustrating. Way too short, but for the price it was acceptable. The game really needs a better clue system, at least in the beginning.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I can't in any honesty claim this if my favorite Bublé CD, but it is an decent offering. Perhaps an bit lackluster compared to his previous albums. If you are an fan, of either Michael, or this genre, still worth purchasing though. Hopefully his next offering will speak to us more effectively.

What [[ASIN:1591845572 The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business]] does for business basics [[ASIN:1591845556 The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything . . .

1423113454|5.0|Writing two different books let alone two completely different mythologies(Greek & Roman to Egyptian) almost at the same time is quite a hassle.<br /><br />Mr. Riordan knows how to incorporate facts into a good story and also makes it quite interesting. Shifting characters from Carter (the scared older brother who needs to step up and knows almost every Egyptian mythology)to Sadie(the very sarcastic British girl) for me is a good change. It gives me both sides of the story from each of the characters unique perspective.<br /><br />Though there is a pattern: From planning something ---> applying the plan ---> Something goes wrong (of course they're the Kanes, something always goes wrong) ---> to someone helping them fight or saving them (which I can understand seeing they are just novices)<br /><br />Although the pattern is there (and some predictable plot twists), there are some unpredictable situations which can either be baffling or simply quite entertaining.<br /><br />The Kane chronicles for me is a great book. This is a MUST read for mythology lovers such as myself.

Buy it because its dope!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I use Dropbox as well as other backup solutions, but I like having multiple backups in case something goes wrong.

0425263916|1.0|Entwined With You really deserves a rating of zero, but since that was not an option, I gave it one star.  To begin with, the premise that a child could be sexually abused for a period of years and never tell her mom, who was shown to be very loving toward her daughter, is hard to believe.  The story line is buried deeply among long, repetitive sex scenes.  I found myself constantly trying to make sense of Eva's actions. To name a few, she goes out with her ex boyfriend, Brett because she feels she should. He is the one that Gideon beat up after he found Eva and Brett kissing yet she constantly professes her love for Gideon. Brett should have been a non-issue. Next, she wants her best friend, Cary to live with she and Gideon after they're married.  Who does that?? Then there's the scene at the night club where she is on her way to meet Gideon, but she stops to dance suggestively with a stranger. I was never able to understand how the wrist restraints were used which I found was a copy from Shades of Gray by E.L. James.<br />The big difference is Ms. James' writing is very explicit.  The reader doesn't have to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />The writing is very poor. I wondered if Ms. Day was high while writing or if the book was written by multiple writers.  There were many sentences that created cognitive dissonance for me. For example, Eva's friend visits her and she takes her guest's purse to be put up.  My thinking is one takes one's guest's coat to be hung up, but women usually hold on to their purses.  In another sentence, Ms. Day writes, \\"Turning my head, I looked at Gideon only to find him gone.\\" I asked myself if she was trying to say that she looked for Gideon, only to find him gone.  Sentences like these permeate the book which I found annoying.<br /><br />To leave readers hanging at the end of the book without resolutions adds insult to injury.  After this book, I could care less what happens to the characters. I usually give my books away, but Entwined With You is going in the garbage. I won't put anyone else through the effort of trying to make sense of something so poorly written and illogical.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.  I went into it expecting a B rate movie at best and found it to be very engaging and actually one of the better sci-fi movies to come out lately. The actors did a good job of playing their parts of high school kids with normal issues and the overall story line was interesting with a few twists that added value.
3836538725|5.0|Salgado&#34;s photography is without current parallel.  His wife's editing is superb. This, his latest published effort prompted me<br />to &#34;fill in the blanks&#34; with many of his earlier works.

B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Back in the 1960's and early '70s I enjoyed just about every project that Eric Burdon ever worked on (i.e. The Animal and the jazz/soul band \\"War\\").  His voice is still in excellent condition and the subject matter for nearly all of the tunes was well versed in their respective songs.  I'm very, very glad that Mr. Burdon decided to finally make another excellent release for the younger generations and even for a lot of us \\"moldy,oldy\\" folks who are still hanging around this veil of tears.  Thanks Amazon for once again giving me a convenient avenue on which to purchase this excellent CD.

B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|The music is majestic and just as compelling as the movie. Some pieces blend the original television theme with the new movie theme and it works melodically. I think this sound track is more powerful than the 2009 movie score.

If you don't love it, well, you're probably not human. Sorry you had to learn this way.<br /><br />I just wanted to comment on one thing about the delivery. I ordered it tonight, and, suddenly, from nowhere, I have a free rental copy on my Amazon instant video collection. I don't know why I got it, but I love it. It may be a Prime benefit, but I purchased another DVD that could be rented over Amazon, and I didn't get anything for it. Anyway, a nice benefit any purchaser should be aware of.

B00005NKKZ|5.0|This is Simon and Garfunkle's last studio album and at a number of points it sounds more like a Paul Simon solo album rather than a Simon and Garfunkle Album.  Even so Art shines through on his solos, especially the title track.  Paul Simon makes his first forays into world beats with Cecilia and El Condor Pasa.  They do manage to harmonize like the old days on a couple tracks, but those are few and far between.<br /><br />This is a must own for any fan of either Paul Simon's solo work or Simon and Garfunkle.  Even though they're obviously coming apart, they managed to stick together for one last masterpiece.

B00026WU9Q|5.0|For half the album, at least, the other half is still acoustic.  Even so he's pushed beyond the boundaries of folk music and into the second phase of his career.  This is the first album of three albums in his rock and roll phase; while not as good as the next two (\\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and \\"Blonde on Blonde\\")this is still a strong album throughout.<br /><br />This album is a watershed.  He still has some simple folk songs (like Mr. Tambourine Man) but most of the album moves into the direction of abstract and personal lyrics that he would continue throughout most of his career.
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|I am an Evil Dead nut. I love the three original films and I have ALL 3 on Blu-ray and DVD. Now, I groaned when I heard a remake was coming. I lightened up when I found out Sam, Rob and Bruce were involved. I lightened up even more when people started talking this movie up and people hyping all the gore and grue this movie had. I decided to be open minded and give it a chance.<br />1. A remake is supposed to be MORE gory than the original. The original is FAR gorier than this movie. Sorry, the gore is a tad overrated. It is gory, but everyone made out like wall-to-wall gore.<br />2. The people are too stupid to sympathize with. Granted, the kids in the original were no geniuses, but these people are rock stupid. They're in a cabin with a bunch of rotting cats for quite a while, before someone finally notices? Everything tells the one numb nuts not to read the book, but he does anyway. In the original, creepy things were already going on, LONG before they find the tape.<br />3. They took away the scary suspenseful part. In the originals, it was scary that the evil force was everywhere and nowhere. It could possess you and un-possess you at any time. Even worse: no matter what you did, you could not destroy or get rid of it.<br />In this version, they come up with this thing of 'let's do this ritual' and you'll be un-possessed. Also, if you cut off a body part, you go back to normal. Then, the filmmakers screw that up when the girl cuts her arm off. She cuts it off, still possessed. They blow her other arm off, now she's fine.<br />I'm sorry, but Evil Dead 2013 doesn't work for me. I should've known it was gonna not be good, when one of the writers is Diablo Cody. You get the writer of Jennifer's Body and Juno to write this, you can't expect a good movie. Now, here it comes and we don't even get an unrated director's cut. That's okay, I'll go watch my originals.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Gets the job done. exactly what I needed and very handy tool. Was looking for a simple calculator for shopping and percentages and everyday budgeting and this was the perfect app for that
B0041KKYD8|3.0|I watched this movie, being a huge fan of the original. I found it compelling and entertaining. Sarah Butler is very easy on the eyes. The revenge scenes are very inventive and the effects are pretty cool. It's a watchable movie, but I have some problems with this movie.<br />1. You are asking too much from me, wanting me to sympathize with a group of rapists. There are parts in the movie where the filmmakers don't realize what they're doing and the sympathy factor is shifting away from her and going to the guys. For example: Why do they have to have a scene where she smokes a joint, then tells the sheriff that the GUYS are the ones who left it there? Why in the beginning when Johnny is harmlessly flirting with her, she comes off as a snarky smart-ass? (How's that line working out for you?)? Why don't they explain what happened to the sheriff's daughter? I HATE the sheriff in this movie, but I find myself actually feeling bad for HIM, because we don't know the fate of the innocent little girl. WTF?<br />2. The point of a rape-revenge movie is to make a PRO-female movie, not an ANTI-female movie. Jennifer disappears from the movie for a long time and we are stuck with the guys and it turns into like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. We don't see the pain and horror Jennifer endured, like in the original. We see the guys and are spending time with them and they start coming off as decent guys who did one stupid thing, like how in I.K.W.Y.D.L.S., the kids are supposed to be good kids who did one stupid thing and are covering it up.<br />3. Everyone complains about the LONG rape scene in the original, but trimming that section of the movie down, it comes off that the torture she inflicts on them is too much. One guy says he was raping her for 10 seconds, another said maybe 2 minutes, and she's out for most of it. Then look at the LONG, very gruesome torture she inflicts on the guys.<br />4. Did she hide a credit card inside of her, or something? She comes back with a whole new wardrobe, a new car. Where did she get this stuff when the guys supposedly destroyed all her stuff? If they left something of hers behind, would it kill the filmmakers to add a scene of showing her finding it? Also, you have one guy videotaping the whole thing. She gets hold of the tape. Does she take the tape, get it to people she knows she can trust, get these guys and stick 'em in jail for a LONG time? Nope. She gives them back the tape and horribly kills these guys. Again, it's taking my sympathy away from her and turning it to the guys. Rape victims still don't have all the rights they should have, but they have FAR MORE than they did in 1978.<br />To sum up: I am happy that the theme is still there: Rape is a terrible crime and if you rape a woman, you will pay consequences. It is there, but they complicated this movie too much and it shows just how much simpler the original is. Not a bad movie, but the original did a much better job making it's point than this one.

B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|The one thing I've always appreciated about Kanye has been his ability to experiment. The College Dropout was a great album and it is mind boggling that this man is the same artist. There are so many \\"artists\\" out there that are satisfied churning the same old stuff over & over again. If Kanye had done the same after the College Drop Out we would not have this record to appreciate. Is it polarizing, I don't think so. It is good music. If you have heard the Metal Box by Public Image Ltd, you know what to expect and am so glad someone finally took that record on as it is one of the best ever. Mr. West came out with something as dark yet danceable, if that makes any sense. I think the way Dylan described Blonde on Blonde serves Yeezus as well, \\"It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up.\\"

Word on the street is that Andrew Lloyd Webber himself chose him for the part of the Phantom due to his deep voice, btw he does sing.  Emmy Rossum, well, we all know she can sing and she was only 17 at the time, but as Christine she was simply outstanding. I must admit I never did care for the world famous Michael Crawford's voice, Yes, I am aware he is a trained voice, but as angelical as the Phantom's voice is to be, I fell in love with Gerard's voice, (I love his accent). Anyhow,in this movie you will fall in love with the character. You will suffer with him,you will feel his pain!! Now for those Broadway snobs who dissed the movie, you must watch it with an open mind and see it for what it is, a different yet alike version of Broadway. Raoul, the only time I saw emotion on his face and made you feel sorry for him was when Christine and The Phantom sing Point of No Return, I guess he realizes Christine is very much attracted to The Phantom.  I almost forgot Minnie Driver is simply amazing as the Diva Carlotta, unfortunately her voice was dubbed for the movie but she does sing the song \\"Learn to be Lonely\\" at the end credits, a song which could've been a bit longer it's beautiful. Oh, and don't forget to purchase the CD.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|The song &#34;Public enemy #1&#34; pays the whole album.  It is Megadeth recovering their best days.  Thanks Mustaine for coming back.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! Not too easy not too hard.  I don't get mad when stuck on a level. I read that it's only 8 levels though! Noooooooooooooo! Must....make.....more.......levels! Lol!
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Anthrax is returning to their best compositions and this album has a curios history that is about music to worship, and they scare.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have to say this book had me laughing out loud so many times my husband thought there was seriously something wrong with me.  I hightlighted some many funny quotes in my book it looks like a Christmas tree.  This book is hilarious.
B00992CF6W|5.0|His game is one of the best games on this mobile device and it has awesome generated worlds. The only thing they should do is put in updates like unlimited worlds and new mobs and maybe actual cave systems that lead strait to bedrock. Also they need to make it easier to find lava. Other than that, it's an awesome game that just needs a few more updates. Not a rip off. Buy this game!!!!!!!!
1401922732|5.0|These cards & guide book are perfectly accurate whatever your issue or problem. Very easy to work with these cards & super easy to understand meanings through the guide book & your own intuition. I recommend this deck to anyone interested in Angels.<br />Khara Whitead
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Excellent. Surpassed the first year. Do we have to wait until Feb 2014 for the third year to be available in BluRay format, sold at Amazon? If so, drat. Crank it out, guys.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app! It can keep you busy! It actually feels like ur a real detective! And, it is free!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|What a great collection of classics...and a fantastic sound.  It sounds great in the living room and in the car!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|As a huge fan of the previous games, I had high hopes for this one. It did not disappoint. The voiceover by Mr Pelmear was the thing that really pushed this over from being just another puzzler. The guys at Fallen Tree even emailed me when I had trouble finding the game on here. Great interaction with their customers. You outdid yourself, guys. Love it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I was concerned given the length and breadth of this book I would struggle to finish it. But Goodwin captured the Lincoln years so magnificently I was sad to see the book come to and end.  If you choose to read this book you will be rewarded with an amazing glimpse into the life of one of the worlds greatest heroes and statesman.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|thankfully it worked good on 2 others so for $4.00 it was a good value<br />but would have been a mistake if you only had 1 cd player it skipped on
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|I miss pressure sensitivity for getting good line quality but this does come with a lot of interesting brushes.  One has to adjust to its limitations compared to a Wacom tablet and deeper drawing/painting program but, once you do, you can do some nice work, and perhaps surprise yourself by trying a new approach.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm giving this rating because I love  the space that was created between the two characters! Gideon and Eva really are developed characters  by the end of this book, I can't wait to read more!!
B004EHZPEG|5.0|This book helps one think about game design from an almost overwhelming number of perspectives.  Very insightful - deserves to be read and then re-read as I'm sure it will become even more meaning the more experience one has in game design.  I rented it but plan to buy it now that I've read it.
B00AJMQSP0|4.0|till this album i had not listened to Helloween for a long time because for the last 10 years i had not liked any of their albums. this album though has a nice fresh sound from them and they still can bang out the metal even after all these years. if you like Helloween you will like this album. i have been a fan since 1987 and think they have a new fire lit under them with this new lineup.
1476734941|4.0|It explains well how fasting, both short-term and long-term, affects the body, and explains the benefits of each method, and how to lose weight and improve one's health at the same time.  I just received the book and have almost finished reading it.  It´s made me eager to try the \\"fast\\" diet!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|thanks a lot my friends......you know who you are.......a wonderfully addictive game. keeps you guessing. I don't know how long I was stuck on level 7.
015206396X|4.0|This book has a very very good concept and story line to it. The whole idea of a Graceling is awesome to me although it could be explained better in the book. My biggest issue with this book was the author's writing style. She just seemed terribly bad at expressing her characters for the first half or so of the book, but then she improves on this around the middle. The climax is very rapid, without notice, and over before you even know it. This may seem like poor writing to some but for me it just seemed...natural I suppose. It felt very real and true to the characters when it happened; she didn't draw it out to make for more suspense. As the title said I think this book left a ton of potential for it's successors if the writer can hone her skills into giving her characters more depth and thought. She also left many loose ends on characters and absolutely no hints or reasoning to their actions. I realize that the next two books in this series is already out and I have them ordered but have not read them at the time of writing this. I hope my wishes for the next book are realized.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Battery hd is a great app. It keeps me constantly inform of my tablets battery life, usage and more. I like this app
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great used product at a great price.  It plays without skipping and has no scratches, I have no regrets about the purchase.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|When I saw this book was being made into a movie, I couldn't wait to see it.  I can't tell you how disappointed I was by it.  Now, if you haven't read the books, the movie would actually be pretty good on its own.  But, unlike the Harry Potter and Twilight book to movie adaptations where some details were changed here and there to work better within the contraints of a film, beyond the character names and some of the same general plot lines, this movie is a complete departure from the novels.  Not only does the movie remove or entirely change at least half the elements from the novel, thereby deleting a great deal of the interest and intrigue from the story, but it also completely changes the plot at the end.  This movie destroys the possibility of what, if it had stuck truer to the book(s), had the potential to be an amazing set of three or more movies because the books were AMAZING.  If the movie hadn't been decent enough to stand on its own if you hadn't read the books, I would have given it only 1 star.
B00005JG6U|5.0|Great used product at a great price.  It plays without skipping and has no scratches, I have no regrets about the purchase.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I truly love this story it has captured me over and over. I can't wait till the next one. I don't know what else to say  but amazing. Till next time I guess!!!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great used product at a great price.  It plays without skipping and has no scratches, I have no regrets about the purchase.
1454701250|5.0|This is a great book for inspiration, as well as providing some useful templates for your own stamp designs.  It made me think outside the box in terms of what you could use stamps for.  Great for those starting out as well as those who hobby carve.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|T he game is fun, but it can get boring and hard in a lot of places but I still like this game.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|At least once on every DVD, there has been an area that skips, pauses, or the DVD stops and starts over. I'm only on the 4th DVD in the set.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game. I found it challenging enough to keep me wanting to play but not so challenging that it was frustrating. It definitely is too short and I hope they get more levels developed soon!
0525478817|5.0|all i can say is that this book is absolutely perfect. i am not even much of a reader, but i finished this book in 2 days (and thats incredibly fast for me). i fell in love with augustus waters. head over heals in love. he was absolutely perfect. since the moment i opened the book, i couldn't put it down. i went over to my grandparents house the next day, and all i could think about at my grandparents house is what happens next. all i wanted to to is read more. i cried, some parts were happy tears and many were sad tears. but it was a good sad, its hard to explain. now that the book is over, I'm happy and sad. I'm happy because its the best book i have ever read in my whole life. but I'm sad because i really want to read it again, but if i read it again, it won't be the same. i won't get to experience it the same way. so all i can say is read this book.
B00CSWA1PM|5.0|Such a fun, funny and touching show. The recording captures the fun of the stage and keeps you dancing! This has been on a repeat loop since I got it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I initially bought this book off of others reviews & will admit I almost put it down. If you are one of those people, don't do it. Stick with it! There is some odd language & dialog in the beginning but amazingly you get used to it. The main character, Thomas sort of got on my nerves as well in the beginning with all of his questioning but like I said, I stuck with it & I am so glad I did. I ended up reading this in 2 days. I couldn't put it down. It makes you think. The author does a great job of putting you in the middle of the action & developing his characters. When I hate a character, I know the author has done a great job. Oh my gosh, and the ending!!! Didn't see that coming!! Trust me, it's a great read! I just bought book 2. I hope it holds up as well as this one.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I have to admit that I thought that the first episode or two were enjoyable, certainly, but I was not rushing to watch Lark Rise.<br />Well now that I have gotten to know the characters I can say that it is something I really look forward to watching.  The storylines are engaging and you will begin to care about the charcters and their crazy day-to-day lives. With each episode you will see more and more of their hopes and wishes, you will feel their pain and laughter.  Also you will also see  some favorite BBC actors to add to the fun.
B007712XAU|5.0|Both my husband and myself enjoyed this series.  Each time we could find the time to watch it together we would!
B00ANQMZOK|5.0|This 2CD plus 1 DVD set contains The Who's performance at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. The 2 CDs contain the entire concert; the DVD contains most of it.<br /><br />This is The Who in the period following their appearance at Woodstock in 1969 and prior to the release of Who's Next in 1971. Two other live albums by The Who were also recorded in 1970: Live At Leeds and the more recently released Live At Hull.<br /><br />The Who were one of the best bands of the period and this concert shows the band at its best.<br /><br />It's all great material. This is a worthwhile purchase for any fan of The Who.
0744014549|5.0|not hard cover book but they really put great amount of information at this book.<br />Absolutely recommandable book to all game designers!!!
B00847KFDS|4.0|This is a very good album of CCR classics revisited by John Fogerty (or J.C. Fogerty as he used to be called when these CCR songs originally came out over 40 years ago) with a few new compositions added. The CCR classics on the album are done as duets with Fogerty and artists ranging from Foo Fighters, Keith Urban, Kid Rock to Bob Seger.<br /><br />John Fogerty's voice has held up well and his song writing skills are still in evidence on the new material. It's very interesting to hear how he treats the old CCR classics today but, to my ear, these new versions will never replace the old classics.<br /><br />As an aside, I'd also be interested in hearing about the legal arrangements which allowed Fogerty to record new covers of the old CCR material. Remember a decade or so back when the new owners of the copyright on CCR songs sued Fogerty for \\"copying\\" his own compositions from the CCR days. Fogerty won in court, as he should have, but I'd be curious to find out whether those who now own the copyrights on the CCR songs gave Fogerty a hard time over recording these new versions of his CCR compositions.
1781163243|3.0|i love hard book cover but images and contents are quite week compare to other art books.<br />but quite recommandable to Environment artists
B00CL68NOG|1.0|I know he's suppose to be angry but he looks like he needs a good laxative.  I really had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately it was not funny AT ALL! It just came across as a big ad for Gap and M&Ms. Truly terrible!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Time consuming but frustrating, which I like. My only issue is that there is only 8 levels and I was able to finish the game in one night
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Ah! What a story!<br /><br />I wept and wept!<br /><br />Thank you Rachel Joyce!<br /><br />I will give this book to all I love.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I was really disappointed because this book is not that good it think the character Greg is very very full of him self and selfish way more self conserned over himself and using Rowley the way he did when he is sick is terrible.
B003297I1U|5.0|My 3 year old son got this a few months before his 3rd bday.  He has loved it from day one!  He did break a piece, but it really hasn't affected his being able to play with it.  I would definitely recommend to all those machine, truck, construction lovers!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I will have to admit that I can be very very hard to pleas  but man. This might me one of the greatest book  I have  ever read. Just when I think it's solved BOOM something else comes up that blow  my mind. Great job Colleen Hoover!
B000P0J09W|4.0|This is one of those must have films for kids.  A little bit of inappropriate language.  My kids are obsessed with a few children's movies & this is one of them... the other is the &#34;Sand Lot&#34;.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is one of the books I could not put down.  I read the entire book in about 1 week...normally it takes me a little over a month. The first experiment brought me two blessings--a scholarship for my son and a report from my doctor of excellent health.  Simply amazing that all we want is already out there, we just have to ask for it and believe it's happened. Pam, you are funny and a great story teller. Thank you.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A truly timeless story, suitable for all ages. Take it along on a vacation or long car trip and read it aloud.  Your kids will thank you for it.
B007712XAU|5.0|My sister-in-law got me watching this series,  the story line moves along good, you don't get lost and you seem to get to know the people personally
B001LF3YQK|5.0|Looks great easy to use great size perfect for carry on.<br />Love that is clear so you can see when to refill.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game it is realy ineresting and i am only on level 10 but the snatches are realy annoying.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|just what I thought... amazing great stuff... I am so happy i bought this... if you are thinking about it... buy it!
0143119680|5.0|Discovery of Witches was certainly a worthy read! It unravels slowly, so if you are looking for a quick, easy, summer read this is not the book for you!<br />However, if you are interested in a solid plot with beautifully descriptive characters with historical and scientific references-then YES, try it!<br />Positives: Clean, crisp visuals. Colorfully developed & believable characters. A plot that even though unravels slowly (sometimes painfully slow) promises to bloom into a wonderful trilogy! I enjoyed this book so much that I immediately purchased the successor \\"Shadow of the Night.\\"<br />Negatives: The romance novel lover in me could have used some additional description in the bedroom/love scenes, in which there were sadly, very few. I would think that the underlying scientific agenda in this book would allow for an expanded explanation of the main character/love interests (Matthew) anatomy...I mean he IS a vampire and if we are being so very scientific then I want to KNOW how it works that he can have an erection even though he is technically dead and so cold the protagonist (Diana) feels actual snow on her body....just sayin'. But yeah, I felt like this book (while an incredible read) lacked passion and the sexuality between ALL characters was lackluster. With that said, it does NOT take away from the overall enchantment of this paranormal story!
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|didn't seen the movie in theaters... but was pleasantly surprised in my living room... this is soooo much better than Glee in soooo many ways!
B00916TU00|5.0|This is one of those CDs that every song is worth hearing. The extra CD is also pretty good. Great songs, good music, amazing singer.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|If you love games that tell a story through the atmosphere and simplistic gameplay, these are two games that are right up your alley. Each allows the player to explore a vast world, while subtly leading them through a great story.
1611761174|5.0|The characters are interesting and we receive an excellent history lesson as well.  Remember to check your gas gauge. Thanks.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I rented this movie from Amazon believing it was the entire show and not just a \\"first installment\\".  Obviously, I was pretty disappointed when the movie suddenly ended with them staring at a far off view of the mountain.  For a first installment, the movie was pretty good though. Just like in The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson seems to have lifted scenes right out of my imagination from when I read the books when I was younger.  Its pretty cool to see your imagination played out for you on a movie screen.  I don't think the movie had the same epic feel as The Lord of the Rings but the series is going to be good if it keeps on the same way it started.  As far as my experience watching it on Amazon, there was only one hiccup when I had to start the movie over and fast forward to the part where it locked up.  Otherwise I have no complaints.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really liked this game. The game play was smooth,  no flaws,  and kept you on your toes. Worth playing if you like puzzles.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I so loved A Thousand Splendid Suns and The Kite Runner- I expected more from this book. Still worth reading.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|*This is a review of the first commercial CD pressing of The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here.<br />Alice in Chains has done it again and released a very good second album with new singer William DuVall.<br /><br />The album itself has great tracks (Hollow, Stone, & Voices easily the top 3) that any fan of Alice in Chains can appreciate with their similar styles spreading from album to album. Also very pleasing are the acoustic sounding tunes that Voices and Scalpel, making me wish there were a few more available.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The reason I give this 4 stars is the quality of the album's audio and that it lacks some definite edge Black Gives Way to Blue had.<br /><br />1.) Jerry Cantrell, very amazing musician he is, has a tendency on this album to produce songs that follow kind of the same flow, regardless of differences in lyrics and such.<br /><br />2.) The audio levels of this album are absolutely horrible. Another causality of &#34;The Loudness Wars&#34;, the sounds are fatiguing to the listener with almost no dynamics present and an overall equal sound. It's just too damn loud, but that's how the record companies want them to sound like, making the consumers choose CD or Vinyl, lower levels always Vinyl.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Not bad app. Bugs for you to rate every time it opens or changes orientation. Lost star for pestering. Other than that not a bad app at all.
B000008CRU|5.0|Sap is by far the best EP to showcase Alice in Chains acoustic ventures into the dark and unforgiving relationships with drugs and people. Anyone who loves Alice in Chains must add this EP to their collection. Not only do the songs sound good, the audio mastering of these albums for the time period is very good, dynamics exist and allows for pleasurable listening experience.
B0088X7YU0|5.0|I like the CG Movie a lot better than all three of the Starship Trooper movies that came before. I even liked the nudity 'cause it's CG, thus much less easier to lust. Being a single Christian, I strive to avoid lust, (my Power Thought when viewing movies, etc. is: Jesus says don't look at the female images so I don't lust 'em). Another cool CG movie on Blu-ray is Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Farscape is my all time favorite. Misfits online at hulu is very funny. I love my 40\\" 1080p 60Hz Sony TV, and Sony Blu-ray Player. Amazon Prime Streaming Movies seems really cool, it only costs about 7 dollars a month total, plus you get other benefits as well.
B008HTQ28K|3.0|As always, John Grisham keeps me enthralled and entertained.  Love his work and will anxiously await the next Grishim tale.
6304698798|4.0|This employs the special talents of Clint Eastwood very well.  However, I believe it somewhat minimizes the sought effect somewhat by purposely holding back on the &#34;surprise&#34; ending.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I'm really out of shape because I have a hard time staying focused when I try to work out. This app is great because it has a set time to do each exercise and a video to teach you how to do it. It's also great that you can choose which type of exersize you want to do and how long. I'm still sore from using it yesterday.
B00005KAQP|5.0|A very entertaining movie which fully employs Whoopi Goldberg's talent as a musician and actress.  I am not sure Rome would approve, but the humor overshadows any reasonable abjections.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I hats so much!  I put one star because my family is a learning family. This does not make you learn anything at all!  ; (
6305128952|4.0|I could best describe the plot as &#34;A lot of horsing around&#34; but it's more than that.  Robert Redford made us believe that he was a horse expert, and at the same time showed his human side by be tempted to be involved in a touching but illicit love affair.  The unrealistic part was the priority that the horse-owner's family placed on saving a physically and emotionally wounded horse at the expense of possibly breaking up a home, both financially and emotionally.  It ended sadly but for the best.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Seriously? I could understand it if they hated the books from the get-go (in which case there's no way they would still be around to read the third book) but I do not believe for one second that so many people loved the first two books and then suddenly detested the third one, particularly when the storyline has progressed in a fluid, logical fashion and the character development is exactly what one would have come to expect from a well-executed and researched story where the main characters are emotionally complicated sex-abuse survivors. The author has tied up just enough threads at the end of this third installment to keep her real fans satisfied, and left enough loose threads to get us excited about the next book. There has been no sudden decline in the quality of writing, as some 1-star reviews have suggested. Ms Day's writing sparkles and sizzles (can you say hot sex?!) just as much as it ever has. And I don't buy the &#34;But it was supposed to be a trilogy&#34; argument for one second. No one who really, truly loves a book series ever actually wants it to end!<br /><br />So I smell BS with these &#34;Entwined With You&#34; 1-star whiners on Amazon, especially when I see the 4.11 out of 5 rating on Goodreads (with 24,061 ratings!!!). I think the real reason for all the 1-star whiners here is so they can try to justify returning their Kindle purchase for a refund within 7 days instead of owning up to the fact that they are all just basically CHEAP! I think it's particularly bad form to attack an author they previously claimed to love. What happened to integrity?? Sylvia Day has to make a living, just like the rest of us! And it's $10, people?!! The equivalent of a couple of Starbucks Frappuccinos!!! This whole returning kindle books for a refund is kind of like buying a party dress, wearing it out clubbing all weekend long, and then taking it back to the store for a refund on Monday morning. It's just not right!<br /><br />I hope Sylvia Day can see past all this shallow behavior and find comfort in the fact that her real fans loved this book just as much as the previous two. I for one can't wait for the next installment.
B005FUTC86|3.0|I was expecting something different, but it came as a bargain as an addition to my DVD collection.  I will show it to my great grandchildren.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Well thought out, perfectly funny, and delightful to read! I highly recommend this book.<br />I wasn't much of a Fey fan before but i must say,I'm a convert.

B006ZB3V2C|4.0|I'm not hung up on the permissions. Works fine on my Nexus 7. I've used several apps like this one it kind of a pain to navigate compared to Relax melodies but I like this apps sound loops, especially the lightening! too bad there wasn't more binaural beat patterns or an option that allows you to use a preprogrammed scene for the alarm ring tone. Meditation sounds are very nice, a welcome addition to my rotation of meditation/relaxation sounds.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|The Anker 8400mAh battery back is a powerful little wonder. It was sent with a 3/4 full charge and was able to charge up my BlackBerry Z10 from 5% to 75% in about 30 minutes or so right out of the package. I was able to take it with me for a 3 hour flight I was taking the following week and I kept it connected to my BB Z10 the whole time while I was watching a movie and playing some games. The BB Z10 stayed charged the whole time. The Anker battery back does have some heft to it. It is quite heavier than the BB Z10 but with 8400mAh of power, that's to be expected. I really like that it came with several charging adpaters and its own felt-like carrying pouch. The only problem that I have is that it wasn't able to charge my BlackBerry Playbook at all. The Playbook would recognize that it was receiving power for about five seconds or so and then would lose that connection. That was a little disapointing as I had some movies downloaded on the PlayBook but couldn't watch them all the way through since I didn't fully charge it and thought the Anker battery pack would be able to do so. I was, however, able to charge my Dad's Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet that he brought with him so that was a bit of good news. All in all, this is a great little product for the money and I just need to replace my Playbook with a Galaxy tablet and I'll be in better shape.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game. And keeps you very entertained for a long time. Very addicting. Very nice graphics and easy to play.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I think they were trying to make a talking teddy bear saying bad words shocking and funny.  But geez I watched for about 15 minutes every other word was something disgusting and rude.  If I was at the movies I would have asked for my money back.  It should have some endearing qualities, the main character was a jerk, the teddy bear was horrible, and all the supporting characters were just beyond ridiculously disgusting.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Good to know how much battery life you have like that it has it on the pull down  a'll so rates the health of the device.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I absolutely loved the John Williams score, that theme song is very hard to top. It's one of the most recognizable themes, but this album is absolutely amazing. It's fits the movie perfectly and is worth owning and listening to again and again. Major thanks to Amazon for giving me a free MP3 version so the limited edition can stay unopened lol
0316044695|5.0|Wonderful book about true American heros. I couldn't put it down, great story of perseverance triumph and compassion. Definitely worth it.
B001HN69AE|3.0|This movie was a mess...judging it as a Dragon Ball fan it was terrible. They did not capture Goku's personality at all, they botched the origin of the Saiyans and Nameks (read the manga...Ozaru never had any connection to the Nameks) and the story of Chi-Chi and Goku was not a love at first sight thing...Goku had only ever met 1 girl before her and still didn't know how to tell the difference from boys and girls.<br /><br />The casting in this movie was pretty bad as well, aside from Piccolo (James Marsters) and Mai (Eriko Tamura) who did good jobs as there characters. Most of this movies faults come from bad writing.<br /><br />The only reason I'm able to give this an &#34;okay&#34; rating is I knew going in it wasn't going to follow the comics.

B00DF0POXA|1.0|I like Kanye. I usually don't write reviews but this one I had to because I really don't get it. I liked college dropout, his collab with Jay-Z and even 808 (which this album has been compared to). But Yeezus, is really bad. I don't have a problem with electronic beats or autotune, but the beats he created have no apparent rhythm at times and his raps don't even blend well with beat on certain songs. In fact the only track I think is even listenable is \\"Hold your Liquor\\". I understand that he is experimenting with sounds which is great, but I am surprised nobody in his group of friends had the balls to tell him that some of these tracks just sound amateurish at times, and just plain bad. All of my friends agreed that this album is atrocious, that's why I am just in shock that critics love this album, no idea why.<br /><br />Sample this album on Youtube just to see if it's your thing, cause for all I know, I may not understand how genius this album is. That or I just don't buy into the hype. If this album came out under any other rapper or name, I bet it would get extremely low reviews.
0062255657|5.0|Gaiman's latest is a simple but beautiful little tale of a man's touchstone childhood memory. I would recommend it to adults and older readers (it might be too scary to be read to or by smaller children--you judge) without a qualm. If you find yourself beginning it again afterwards and reading it aloud to yourself, well, that's part of its charm.<br /><br />If there is any criticism of the book I can offer, it's that I hated to leave any of these characters behind at the end. But then I realized that more would require either a sequel or a more complex novel, and I'm not sure either would be a Good Thing. The characters will have to live on in my head--which is probably some of the highest praise I can give a book.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Chose the book because of a book club & was told it would be SO sad, to prepare, but after years working in the child welfare system (NYC), I didn't find it quite realistic. I would have actually expected a bit MORE tragedy  and betrayal. Nonetheless lots of true-enough and touching material on love, tenacity, and resilience. My one big complaint, and whole book club agreed, was that the conclusion wraps everything up too neatly and much too quickly for such a complex story.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|for 0ver 50 years<br />this is by far the best.<br />the chnage of venue and time, makes the action seem somehow much more important.<br />I have ordered two copies for friends as gifts.<br />I know a few people who also think that this is the best recorded Rigotetto
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Truly moving, touching, and you forget that you're even reading subtitles. The two men truly are a dynamic duo, and show the strength of an unlikely friendship bond. It's just that good- trust me. :)
B00860YICC|5.0|This is a movie for everyone who enjoys music, and everyone else too. I will not give away any secrets, but 1900 is the name of a young man played by Tim Roth (Lie to Me) who is a piano savant. He was born on board an ocean liner and has never set foot on land. The piano playing is superb as is the story, being told by the ship's trumpet player (Pruitt Taylor Vince). Watch this movie!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I have 4 girls, ages 15, 9, 5, & 3 and they love it.  So many hairstyles to create and imagine.  The possibilities are endless.  This is by far the best hair salon game.  Great design.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Never having seen Les Mis on stage, I was blown away by the quality of the singing in this movie. I was of course familiar with the story line but had never seen it performed. Get your tissues ready at the end...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games like this so this one was really awesome to try out. amazing game you should try it out.
B000001EC1|3.0|Good music to play while traveling down the road on a hot summer night with the top down on your convertible.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is fun. I like the challenge of putting the clues together. The graphics are decent. I hope there are more levels.
1472200314|4.0|This is one of those childhood fantasy/myths that Gaiman does so very well. The trouble is I'm not so sure he hasn't done it even better in The Graveyard Book, Coraline or Stardust.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok needs some improvements obviously but is decent and a good time consumer. Good thing it was free because I wouldn't buy it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy! Once I started reading it I could not put the book down. I am on the second installment of this book and it just gets better. Also, I like the fact that I can read it on my kindle. Can't wait to see what the ending will be!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. However, when I brought up the subject at a party this past Spring, other women said they couldn't finish it and found it very disturbing.  So beware.  I thought the lead character was very, very clever.  They called her several other names - use your imagination.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|this game is easy and a fun thinking game. I got my husband playing it. love the auto shuffle that it does.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|Except for the Wide Area Network cloud being a slow, it does what it needs to do.  Don't try looking a t mpegs or other movie files because it need to down load it completely before it will show it.  Not a streamer which would be a great improvement.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This series of books is an atrocity to the English language. The story is lacklustre and predictable. I don't know why I read this. I wish they could refund my brain cells.
B008K93302|3.0|Does the job in most cases but you have to download the video completely.  Not a streaming player.  Hoping for better products down the road for the kindle.
0316223239|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long while. I went through a wide range of emotions while reading the book - anger, sadness, joy. It has such a novel take on motherhood. I would highly recommend this book.
1863513418|5.0|I am thrilled to have a copy of this comprehensive work, a great teaching/learning book, easy to follow.<br />Thanks Amazon.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Ordered the set about 3 weeks ago and have just received it via extra slow mail. Have run a couple of the disks in my dvd player - the quality is excellent. Given the price and the quality, it's worth the discount and the time you have to wait to receive the product. would purchase from the seller again.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|i guess i would have liked it, but it is just not responding, it just so weird. but by reading all the reviews, it looks like a pretty good game.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|I liked this book more than The Heroes, actually. Abercrombie's characters are rude and gruff, but that's the charm. I really enjoy this author.
B000056JQE|1.0|Not what I really wanted. Description made it sound like it was a part 2 movie. Never heard of a movie being different based on a region.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I really liked the first season and had high hopes for the second. It wasn't that good. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't have spent the money to purchase the season pass.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|This was the best album so far although I have loved all the others even the one Michael didn't like,lol.
B000YH6YG8|3.0|Apparently this is the version of Edward Norton that my fiance always sees when we watch a movie with him in it. He does play unbalanced quite well. There are definitely twists and turns in the plot, and it resonates when done.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Lots of FUN,  could watch it again... thinking of buying it..husband loves action movies,  Yes, of course it was  over the top. Isn't that the point of being entertained?
B00BESM14U|3.0|I watched this movie while working on a research project and it actually managed to pull my attention away from the project a few times. Some parts were stereotypical coming of age, but I found it overall worth a watch.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I purchased the CD for my 5 year old daughter's birthday who absolutely loves Kelly Clarkson. She listens to it constantly and takes it with her everywhere we go. Couldn't be happier.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I went to lay down for bed and read the entire book instead. Lovely story, captivating. It's a book that I could read more than once, and soon, which is rare.
B007R41E8O|1.0|The resources portion seems to mostly download, then the next time I try to open it I see that it has looped and is beginning download of resources again!  This has been going on for two days!!!!  I want a refund!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love the Silo series. I initially purchased the first book because it was cheap, but it was surprisingly good.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I loved reading the continuation of Rachel and Darcy's story, this time the focus being on Darcy, and her perspective of the events leading up to the demise of their friendship. Darcy does a lot of growing up and finds out the true meaning of what being a friend is all about. Highly recommend.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very fun game. Everyone should play this game. I hope I can get the update really fast.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I was so excited when it arrived I did a Game of Thrones Marathon and and about a week later I viewed it again.  I am hooked on the show.  Can't wait for season 3
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love it its awesome I love building so much and this game lets you. this game game is just awesome.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed it although it was not the greatest one I have seen .The actors did a great job but didn't compare to the  25th anniversary version  .
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I just downloaded this last night and it is very addicting. I would very much recommend this game for everyone.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Love this game just wish I can get investment points fast.this game is really fun and you can spend hours playing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very cool. Lots of fun. I enjoy playing this game all the time and would never stop playing it ever
1610454812|5.0|Purchased for Father's Day. Consumers should know that this audio (and the book as well, obviously), contains some foul language. My husband loves the content of the book in spite of the disappointment over the cussing, and is preparing to send copies to friends. Every night he comes home and shares with me things from the book; he likes it well enough that although he hasn't finished listening yet, he has said he will listen to it again when he is done to make sure he didn't miss anything when distracted by outside interruptions.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I remember this because I broke out laughing, then realized nobody else was laughing.  Sorry.  At least I didn't text through the whole movie.<br /><br />This new Superman gets off to slow start, spending a fairly long time on Krypton.  It's an interesting Krypton though, with a sort of Dark City wardrobe.  A lot of gadgets that look like jellyfish with snow crab claws for legs.  Nice!  Jor-El uses a giant bird-like critter as a taxi, pretty much straight out of the Taarna sequence in Heavy Metal.  Suffice to say, this is not the type of Krypton where they have achieved peace and everyone walks around wearing a toga.<br /><br />Once Cal gets to earth, it's a different movie.  Instead of mapping things out the way they did on Krypton, on earth there are just a few flashbacks and (I guess) the assumption that maybe you've already heard Superman's story.  The rest is 90 minutes of special effect battle scenes.  While not much is new, they will be hard to top.  I particularly enjoyed the incredibly good looking Antje Traue.  The effects are academy award level and if they give an award for product placement, Nikon and iHop are a shoe-in.  There is also a religious vibe as Superman gets his strength from the sun and you can literally hear the angels singing.  By the way, we are also blessed with an atmosphere that's better than Krypton's which is surprising but nice to know.  For the type of movie it is, it's very good.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Funny how his books always have 1 or  2 interesting African American characters, always down to earth and no sooo stereotypical. I enjoyed Mr. Grisham trying to write from a black character's perspective since this was his main character. This was different and I really enjoyed it. A few surprises are always nice.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|This could have been a spectacular movie.  Emphasis on 'could', because the story line ties in beautifully with the original film, but you have to slog through so much else it almost isn't worth it.  The acting varies from average to just plain bad, the dialog is painful, and the sets often made me feel like I was watching the original.  This is the 21st century, right?  I had far too much trouble believing Oz was real.  We nearly gave up on things half way through, but I had to see how Oz pulled it off in the end.  It's just a shame someone didn't pause during the making and say \\"wait a minute, we can do better than this.\\"
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|For installation info: see review by Peggy A.<br />For permissions info: see review by Robert Reese.<br /><br />I downloaded this Lightning Bug - Sleep Clock as the faotd, but this is a good value at the regular price.<br />The sound quality is quite impressive and the pictures add to the experience.<br />Lightning Bug currently has 12 plug-ins available plus an update.<br />These 12 plug-ins are FREE with the Amazon version of this app.<br />Other versions of this app (from other sources), charge .99 to 1.49 for each plug-in making this quite a value.<br /><br />You will need to \\"play\\" with Lightning Bug to become familiar with the many options available (You won't break it). The help and FAQ files seem to only be available to Facebook users. This is a peeve of mine as I do not think that people should be required to use Facebook for product support. This is only a minor problem as the options are easily discovered.<br /><br />I installed this app on my Transformer Prime and my Nexus 7. Lightning Bug works well on both tablets.<br /><br />Lightning Bug has and option to display the local weather. This option requires network permissions and location information to work. This can be a nice feature when using this app as a clock. The weather feature works well on my Transformer Prime, but not at all on my Nexus 7. This indicates that the weather feature might or might not work for you.<br /><br />The network permission is also used to install plug-ins. If you do not install any plug-ins, you are missing out of one of the nice features of the Amazon version of Lightning Bug - Sleep Clock. The 12 plug-ins available are free and can add to your experience. You don't have to install all 12, but you probably will find a few that you will like. A network connection is needed to install plug-ins, but it is not needed to use the plug-ins.<br /><br />I placed my tablet in airplane mode, and this app worked quite well, to include the \\"installed\\" plug-ins. The weather feature did not work, (obviously), while in airplane mode.<br /><br />The sound and visuals are so nice with Lightning Bug that I am tempted to connect my tablet to my TV, just to see what the experience would be like. I have not done this yet, but I am tempted (It has possibilities).<br /><br />Lightning Bug - Sleep Clock is a good app that I think you will enjoy using.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series, Can't wait for the fourth series? They keep you on your toes.<br />I will keep watching.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wasn't too bad. I've played the same game online and this one has far less glitches. Only improvement would be more levels.
B00JPUUQVE|5.0|scanners is one of my favourite David cronenberg films, i still love watching the film today<br />i already have the Second sight films blu-ray version from last year which i think is the best version yet<br />when i found out that Criterion were also going to release this film on blu-ray i knew i had to buy it<br />just to check out the picture quality and the new special features<br />so i bought it this week off amazon.com and i've just finished watching it the blu-ray version not the 2 DVD'S<br />that come in the package i think that's ridiculous to add 2 dvd's discs with the blu-ray Disc.<br /><br />here's my Comparison review<br />The Criterion collection vs the Second sight films U.K. blu-ray version<br />the picture quality for criterion version is suppose to have 2k Digital transfer<br />well i found the Criterion picture quality very similar to the Second sight films version actually<br />the picture quality for the criterion & Second sight films are both excellent quality, very clean and crisp<br />as far as i'm concerned they both have the same aspect ratio aswell<br /><br />except for the Audio quality<br />there is only one Audio track for the Criterion version a Master Audio mono soundtrack<br />there is no new 5.1 surround sound mix on the criterion version which i think is Disgusting<br />the HD transfer maybe excellent but there is only a Master audio mono soundtrack<br />which is poor sound quality in my opinion, 5.1 surround sound mix is much better<br />now the Second sight films U.K. blu-ray<br />has both Master audio mono track and Master Audio 5.1 surround sound mix<br />so scanners fans can choose which Audio track they want<br />but tragically the Criterion release only has Master audio mono track, very pathetic.<br /><br />The special features are the Highlight with both blu-ray versions i think<br />the first U.S. dvd release by MGM had no extras anyway,<br />the first U.K. dvd release by Anchor bay had a Documentary on David cronenberg<br />and a small 10mins interview with film critic<br /><br />Criterion collection made the effort for scanners fans for sure on this U.S. blu-ray release<br />there is a new 22 mins Featurette on the special effects on scanners<br />explaining the Head exploding scene and the last scan scene between Michael ironside & Stephen lack<br />there's interviews with Chris Walas, Cinematographer Mark Irwin<br />Rick baker,Stephen Dupuis and other special effects make up assistants that worked on scanners<br />there's also a new interview with Michael ironside about his experience on scanners goes for 20mins<br />and a interview with Actor stephen Lack<br />There's also a 1981 interview with cronenberg on the Bob Mclean show<br />David cronenberg was the supervisor for the new HD transfer of the film<br />but was not interviewed for this blu-ray release for some reason.<br /><br />Now Second sight films from the U.K. have done a very similar thing with their blu-ray version<br />there's all new interviews with Mark Irwin and<br /> a first time interview with Producer Pierre David who talks about the production for scanners<br />talks about actress Jennifer o'neil very interesting interview<br />Interview with Stephen lack goes for 30mins<br />Interview with make up effects assistant Stephen Dupuis<br />and interview with Actor Lawrence Dane, 5mins<br /><br />i thought out of all the scanners dvd's releases  with MGM, Anchor bay which are pathetic releases<br />this Second sight films blu-ray of scanners is the best version to get for any scanners fan<br />excellent HD transfer and a new 5.1 Master audio track and all new interviews definitely worth the money<br />you can still buy it from amazon uk for sure<br />but now Criterion collection has now released their blu-ray of scanners<br />with all new interviews with the special effects make up team, Michael ironside & stephen lack<br /><br />the packaging for criterion version is pathetic, it's 3 Discs, 2 Discs and blu-ray Disc in fold out Digpak<br />i prefer a clamshell keepcase with 3 Discs inside<br />the U.K. blu-ray is just clamshell keepcase which i think is better<br />i have both this U.S. criterion release and the U.K. second sight films release blu-ray's<br />i think they're both worth 5 stars for sure No doubt it<br />for any scanners fans out there, your decision either get this new criterion release<br />or the second sight films U.K. release which you need a region free player for for region B U.K.<br /><br />definitely worth the cash to buy both.
0307476073|2.0|Seemed like a coming of age book by a 17/18 year-old, luckily it did not take too much time to read so the waste was not signficant
0802473156|4.0|Just got the book and started reading it... only on page 5 but seems interesting so far. Book came in good condition!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game.  Fun yet challenging. Great graphics. Easy to play yet not too early easy.  Great for all ages to play
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Free is good! I love a quick read! It is easy to download with just one click! My bookshelf is stocked with good free books!
B008KP6ENE|3.0|This is a fun game to play.  Great levels, nice graphics, and it's smooth playing as well.  However the dragon mini game is either not completed or is just broken.  After about 20 seconds in there is no land and you air walk to a game over.  Developers please fix!  Otherwise it would be a 5 star game for me.
1432794426|5.0|Thank you for this wonderful and so needed book.I had tears in my eyes reading it and my heart was aching once again for Michael's sweet, innocent and loving soul.If I were to write myself a book on Michael this is the kind of book I would have written, full of love, compassion and understanding for Michael and what he's been through all of his life .<br />Even if you read all the books out there about Michael, this is a must read for everyone.I only wish that non-fans would read it too.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Pros:<br />1. Great selection of scenes.<br />2. Good selection of the number of puzzle pieces.<br />3. Nice layout and display of puzzle types for play.<br />4. Can pay to remove ads or play with ads, users choice.<br />5. Nice piano music volume tone and tempo.<br />6. Plenty of free puzzles to keep interest.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Cannot add your own scenes. Could add HD photo support from camera.<br />2. Piano music gets old fast. No variety. Could add amazon playlist support.<br />3. No User input on puzzle picture requests. Elegant actress pictures?<br />4. Puzzle tray does not contrast pieces for easy viewing.<br />5. Did not find puzzle piece rotation during assembly of puzzle.<br />6. Magic Puzzles should list HD support for basic game on app store sales icon.<br />7. All add-ons should state add-on and requires magic puzzles basic or HD.<br /><br />FINALLY: I found this to be a very nice app for down times during appointments, camping, or travel e.t.c. I will recommend this app to everyone who asks. The app could be a lot better with some small changes. Thanks for reading this. \\"Mist\\"
B0058HDHAK|5.0|Brings back just how good the Beatles really performed.<br />They obviously put forth the effort to simply do their jobs perfectly
B001NLKT60|4.0|The book was great I can not wait to start the last book. The story line was better than I expected. The details and characters were awesome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game! I enjoyed the challenge not to hard not to easy  just right. I can't stop playing and I keep asking family and friend to try and escape the room. Very entertaining a MUST PLAY!
B00985E3UG|5.0|Fantastic history and disturbing insight re the food industry and how we have ceded control of our lives to entities that have very little (if any) regard for our well- being.  Well researched and written.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I knew Josh would be good but Julianne surprised me in a good way. These two together had great chemistry and the kids were great too. Definitely a &#34;chic flick&#34; but hey I'm a chic and I enjoyed it. :)
B00A81NFAS|4.0|This is a feel good movie. Two people with a lot of baggage leave their comfort zone and find a silver lining in life. If life doesn't come about the way you planned it,  see what you can do with what you have. There is always a reason when things happen although you might not understand it at the time. They changed when they saw how things were and didn't try to change the situation.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was different for me and I was a little hesitate to read it but OMG glad I did, it was funny, sweet and a great read....Seriously needs to be made into a movie or TV show
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it.  I've already made a tower, a secret hideout, a valcano,and an farm. it is amazingly heterodox then suvivlecraft

B007NESBK2|5.0|A feast for the eyes as well as the ears.  All your old favorites performed faithfully, with new classics prominently displayed.  The band is tight, the sound is crystal clear, the visuals are fresh, and Sade is as gorgeous as ever.

B00BSO2U1Y|1.0|I HAVE MORE THAN A SLIGHT SUSPICION THAT BARTOLI IS QUITE OVERATED AND HAS BECOME A ONE -WOMAN DOG AND PONY SHOW.  AFTER AN ENCHANTING CENERENTOLA, I GOT NINA, WHICH IS A TREATISE ON OVER-THE-TOP BAD ACTING AND STAGING.  AND NOW, THIS NORMA, WHICH BARTOLI INSISTS ON CALLING A RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL.  REALLY?  RATHER, IT IS BEL CANTO REWRITTEN TO SUIT BARTOLI'S IDIOSYNCRATIC VOCAL GIFTS. BYE TO THE NOTION OF LEGATO; WELCOME TO THE MANIC WORLD OF STACATTO.  GIOVANNI ANTONINI CONDUCTS AS IF HE WERE IN CHARGE OF A HORSE RACE. IN OTHER WORDS: BELLINI TURNED INTO ROSSINI.  SUMI JO'S COLORATURA SOPRANO DOES NOT CONTRAST ENOUGH WITH BARTOLI'S LIGHT MEZZO.  THEREFORE, MOST OF THE TIME THEY SOUND IDENTICAL.  AND WHO IS JOHN OSBORN? ON RECORDS: CALLAS STILL IS THE VERY BEST. ON DVD, I HAVE CABALLE/ VEASEY/ VICKERS AND SUTHERLAND/ TROYANOS/DIAZ/ORTIZ.

1423113462|5.0|I bought this book for my 11-year-old grandson for his birthday. The book arrived in excellent condition, and, since my grandson asked for it specifically, I'm sure that he will enjoy it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love this apps it lets me download all my favorite songs for free can use it any where is a very good app I recommend it to others
B00004SA8A|5.0|Uniformly indispensable..and since yet another glowing review seems pointless, I would instead like to suggest that at some point you invest in Radu Lupu's exploration of the best of these sonatas...they can only give you additional pleasure. If this seems like too much of a good thing, I can assure you that it isn't..., as both provide different insights and imaginative color to great music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and entertaining app. keeps you thinking. I would recommend this app. it is a nice time waster. I didn't like having to rate this app to continue on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awesome app it is so cool you have the awesome update so awesome you make whatever you want however you want. Just get the skill and your friends will be amazed . If you want to be noticed as a cool builder GET THIS APP imeanit
1616550414|5.0|First half of the book was all about Skyward Sword which took up alot of room. However, the rest of the book had interesting facts, theories, and artwork that conveyed a flash of nostalgia. I enjoyed this book and will be added to my collection!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging and frustrating...in a good way.  I will be excited to see more levels coming...and very soon I hope.
159463176X|3.0|I like his writing; his way with words, his philosophic comments.  The change from Afghanistan to France was a good contrast and certainly pointed out differences in opportunity and how education can elevate.  I could not keep up with all the characters and time periods.  This book is not as engaging as The Kite Runner.
B0082Z447U|4.0|Interesting being written from each of the characters perspective.  Language of that era different than todays but liked the book
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a very good app.  It gets me up in the morning with a variety of sounds and I can also add math problems before I cancel the alarm.  No more oversleeping for me!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is a great game. Really keeps you on your toes and your brain spinning. Definitely recommend to download this game.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen was amazing for her time.  This would be an incredible book even if it were written today.  I have read it twice and purchased the move as well.  LOVE IT!
0747599874|5.0|I am so happy to have this lovely book in my collection! I never liked the American paperback copies that Scholastic sold over here and when I saw a copy of this in a photo online I was insanely jealous. Now I have my own! The cover is gorgeous, the quality is great, and the illustrations are gorgeous! I also love that the cover pages continue the story, stating that the book is translated from the runes by Hermione Granger and from the collection of Albus Dumbledore. I could not be happier!

B00DF0POXA|5.0|Are you looking for the next \\"Gold Digger\\" or \\"Stronger?\\" You are not going to find it on this album.<br />Kanye West decided on having no radio singles, no music videos, no album cover and extremely minimal promotion for his latest effort, \\"Yeezus.\\"<br />It is official. Kanye has lost his mind and I'm in awe of this album.<br />After the triumph of his last album, \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\\" Kanye decides to delve deeper into the dark side for this whack job of an album.<br />The production is strange and out there and the lyrical content is something else.<br />As soon as you hear the first line on the opener \\"On Sight,\\" where he says \\"Yeezus season approaching,\\" hang on, it's going to be a crazy ride.<br />His anger increases on \\"Black Skinhead\\" and the most WTF song ever, \\"I Am A God.\\" Only Kanye can get away with saying \\"Hurry up with my damn massage. In a French a** restaurant. Hurry up with my damn croissants\\" and make it sound good.<br />All three of the above mentioned tracks got assistance from Daft Punk, which gives \\"Yeezus\\" an industrial feel.<br />\\"New Slaves\\" is one of the best tracks with what I think is the line of the year, \\"You see there's leaders and there's followers. But I'd rather be a d*** than a swallower.\\"<br />Then comes the mellow \\"Hold My Liquor\\" featuring Chief Keef and Justin Vernon. It's one of, probably two tracks, that may find its way on to radio. The other being another one of my favorite tracks, \\"Send It Up\\" featuring King Louie. Also produced by Daft Punk, this track is all over the place but you can't help but get sucked in by the beats backed up by Kanye's cockiness, which is on every track of this album.<br />The album finishes with the easiest breeziest track, \\"Bound 2,\\" which sounds like a lost track from \\"The College Dropout.\\" Gotta love the humor in the lyric, \\"Hey, you remember where we first met? Okay, I don't remember where we first met.\\"<br />The album is only 10 tracks. But I'll take the whole, \\"Less is more,\\" approach. This album is easily a \\"You're going to love it or hate it\\" type album.<br />It's always iffy when an artist decides to experiment with different sounds, but Kanye is a risk taker in the industry and he knows exactly what he's doing.<br /><br />Best tracks: \\"On Sight,\\" \\"New Slaves,\\" \\"Send It Up\\"<br />Worst tracks: Not really any, but if I have to pick a weak one, I'd go with \\"Guilt Trip.\\"

B000UX6THK|5.0|I've never called myself a &#34;Peaks Freak&#34; but I suppose I meet some of the criteria to fit under this moniker, and after indulging in the Definitive Gold Box Edition I do so with a certain enthusiasm that I had forgotten I had for this show and its characters. The boyish wonderment while lost in the Twin Peaks universe was swept into a fire of obsession just like it did when I first watched the program in Junior High and later, in its totality, in college, a flush of nostalgia for a unique pocket of pop culture history driving me to compulsively daydream at work about the episodes I had watched the night before. Even at its worst, and it does get pretty bad, its still a special journey unlike any other television drama. After a monstrous six or seven episode lag occurring immediately after Laura Palmer's killer is revealed in the second season, the series gains a bit of its original footing back at the finish line, wrapping up with a sensationally weird, cliffhanger finale directed by the mastermind himself. Twin Peaks was always loosely satirizing the soap opera genre by utilizing its style, but it took itself seriously enough to permit its audience to invest emotionally into those conventions. The style was a comical device but it was also the theater in which the authentic drama was displayed. The decision to reveal Laura Palmer's killer (the show's MacGuffin) was pressed onto David Lynch and Mark Frost by the Network, insisting on it due to the audience demand. In retrospect this is arguably the biggest blunder in television history. Lynch claims he had never intended to reveal the identity of the killer. Bitter over compromising his vision Lynch stepped back from the show as did Frost, affiliated only on a production level as they took on new projects. The show really idles in its lack of direction from its co-creators. I mean it becomes obvious during these post-Laura episodes that the show has gone into a tailspin with absolutely no compass. It's onlygoal seems to be to indulge in quirkiness and in doing so the show gets close to becoming annoying. The storylines during this span of episodes are contrived, disingenuous, absurd and nearly unwatchable. You would have had to have been the holiest of Peaks Freak during the original broadcast to hang through this schlock and even on DVD it gets tough but because you know there is an endpoint you hang out a little longer, even if the show isn't taking itself seriously anymore because for some reason you do, or you want to, and so you force yourself into believing its still legit, or on some &#34;next level&#34; trip, or that any episode now it will all turn around. And then something wonderful happens. It almost pulls off such a feat. The show, near its final arch, begins to gain momentum with a boost of magic. A huge attraction to Twin Peaks was its metaphysical elements. While watching the last five episodes of season two I couldn't help but to think of LOST, another program which relied on supernatural twists which I was a huge fan of. The last time I had seen these season two Twin Peaks episodes LOST hadn't been created yet so I never thought of any borrowed aspects of the Twin Peaks universe existing in other shows but watching the episodes now I definitely see a connection. My awareness of the influence Twin Peaks had on LOST added a thrill to the last three episodes. The show was heading in a direction that could have been beautiful again if allowed a season three, but unfortunately, it was too late. too much damage had been done from the lag. But then again maybe Twin Peaks is Twin Peaks because the way it left. One of the reasons the end of the second season remains enduring is probably because we'll never know how it was to continue and so we are left to imagine it on our own.<br /><br />The Extras included in the box set are very complementary and insightful to the series. I felt I learned a lot about the show that I didn't know from watching the making ofdocumentaries and seeing some of the cast at the time this was filmed was interesting as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game, just wish it had more levels. I beat it in about an hour. Looking forward to new levels!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great story, they characters are so very rich and complex, the plot is interesting and makes you wonder what will be Ender´s nect challenge, this a good story even if you´re not into sci fi books, just hpe the movie does the book justice and Hollywood does not cripple it.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a very fun and awesome app for anyone horse people or not. I'm a horse person, so that's why I was attracted to this app. There is a few things that are unrealistic but I probably only say that because I am around horses every day and own five of them, but it's stuff like it says it's a quarter horse but they are gated, see that's something only a horse person would realize :P. But I really enjoy this game. It has great graphics it's never blurry, but it can lag from time to time. But I do suggest this game to anyone who is interested in horses it is very great.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) is a former British Prime Minister who wants to have his biography written. A former aide of the Prime Minister, Mike McAra, is hired by publishers Rhinehart to do the biography, but he disappears from a ferry and is later found washed up on a beach. At the time it is assumed he committed suicide. Then a new ghost-writer (Ewan McGregor) is appointed. Lang is accused of assisting the U.S. in rendition of terrorists who were tortured for information, and this causes panic in his household sequestered on a U.S. island. Lang's personal secretary, Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall), insists that al the writing of the biography should be done within the confines of Lang's home. Then new information left by McAra comes to light and the new biographer becomes something of an investigative journalist. McAra's body doesn't wash up where it would be expected by the tidal flow. A woman who sees activity on the beach the night the body was discovered falls down stairs and ends up in a coma. An old Cambridge buddy of Lang's, Paul Emmett (Tom Wilkinson), turns out to be a CIA operative. The charges of Lang's complicity in the rendition are levelled by one of his former minister's that he sacked, Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh), and the ghost writer decides to assist him with his enquiries. This is a gripping political thriller, well acted and skilfully directed by Roman Polanski.

B00BXKOMT6|2.0|The book deals with a warrior, Vaelin Al Sorna,  who, as a young boy of ten, is dropped off by his father to serve in the \\"Sixth Order\\".  These are a group of fighters who are endure rigorous and dangerous training to become the elite fighters for the Kingdom. Vaelin becomes a legendary leader and finds himself involved in many moral and religious dilemmas.  I purchased this book because of the amazing proportion of 5 stars given by Amazon.com readers.  I enjoyed the beginning but after a while I simply became bored with the many battles.  There was some worthwhile intrigue and palace politics that kept my interest for a while, but by the end I just didn't care what happened.
1451648537|5.0|This is a great book and fully deserves all of the praise it received.  Steve Jobs was a fascinating individual.  The fact that impressed me most was that he could be so brilliant in certain areas and so completely clueless in others.  While most people know the broad outline of his life, Isaacson goes into a tremendous amount of detail about Jobs's rise, fall, and rise at Apple.  I use most of these products and while I certainly have issues with the company, there is no doubt that few can match Apple's for creativity and design.  Jobs also made some mistakes along the way and there is a least a strong suggestion that if he hadn't believed so much in the mystical power of diet, he might not have died of cancer.  Jobs could also be a real bastard and this also comes out very clearly in the book.  It's been a while since I've read any non-work related nonfiction.  This book was good enough to convince me that I need to find time for more of this genre.

Everyone should at least try dairy free cookies--they are surprisingly soft and yummy.  With the exception of traditional choc. chip cookies (can't beat grandma's dairy laden recipe), I have liked all the recipes I have tried.  Lots of savory tastes.  Give it a try, it's a tiny packable book that doesn't require that much room on the shelf.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is the best game because it lets you take care of a horse so you know what it's like to take care of a horse
1400069289|4.0|A fascinating study on habit and also of change. I enjoyed the ways the author integrated different aspects of habit whether it be social change like the Bus Boycott or personal change like AA. Read it alone for Target's marketing program....all in all, a great book!
B002APU580|5.0|This is one of the many versions of Pride & Prejudice you'll find on the market, but this is my favorite.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I love both NCIS shows. As of season 4, the characters are really well developed and I enjoy watching the subtle insertion of their past into the shows. LA models the original in many regards, including the underlying attraction between partners. If you like the original formula, you'll like this one.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|After I watched Hitchcock, about the making of this film, I pretty much had to watch Psycho again. Not sure when I first saw it, maybe in college, but I had forgotten pretty much everything except for the shower scene and the end. So it was nice to see it again and re-familiarize myself with the actual plot. Also great to experience the cultural zeitgeist of 1960 America, and to appreciate the gorgeous Janet Leigh. The most memorable parts are not of course nearly as powerful as the first time you watch it, but it's fun to analyze the whole structure of the film after watching Hitchcock.
B00BF11STU|4.0|The first half of Zero Dark Thirty is pretty confusing. So many Arab names. So many pieces of the puzzle to track. We start right in with the torture, and it is not fun. Gradually as many threads lead to dead ends, we start to get a more coherent picture. The narrative is punctuated by numerous terrorist bombings. Sometimes you know the explosion is coming, because you're familiar with the incident. But you never know exactly when, and each time it's a heart-stopping shock. Scenes of wandering through urban areas of Pakistan looking for a suspect are appropriately chaotic. And when we finally get to the raid on Bin Laden's compound, the mood is admirably reserved. No music through any of it, just terse commands and lots of night-vision shots. Jessica Chastain is convincing as Maya, the one who sees the search through from beginning to end. James Gandolfini is perfect as Leon Panetta, the CIA Director (although he is not named in the movie other than \\"CIA Director\\", similarly, Maya only has a first name). Especially haunting is the final scene, when Maya boards a plane back to the States and it's clear she has no idea what she's going to do now.

B00COHAUD4|5.0|I had to watch this movie while peeking through my fingers. It was very scary and it had a great storyline. The director who made this film has done many other films that I've really liked so I knew before I watched it that it almost had to be good. It didn't disappoint.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was expecting an ending, there was really no story. I was so disappointed, that I sent it back for a refund. I loved 50 Shades but when I read Sylvia's first two in the Crossfire Series, I liked the story line so much better. Now, I am just done and don't even care to read the next one.

1579128955|5.0|I checked them book out of the library in the hopes that it would have some neat photos of the elements.  I was shocked at how interesting the book is! I started reading it to my children (ages 5-10) and they didn't want me to stop reading.  My 10 year old has been reading the book in his spare time, with his younger siblings peaking over his shoulder and asking him to read it out loud to them.  He even tried to sneak to book into his bedroom tonight so that he could read it under his blanket with a flashlight.  I apprehended the book and stayed up late reading the book myself.  I am not a scientist and am not particularly interested in chemistry, but I loved this book.  The author is humorous in many of his descriptions, and I'm fascinated at seeing what is made from the various elements.  It is a rarity for me to check out a library book and love it so much that I purchase a copy for us to have at home.  I'm about to buy a couple copies of this book, one for my family and one to give as a gift.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read this book as soon as you possibly can. You will not be disappointed. I could not put it down.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|different from the previous one giving my h variety.  Then you have to build new parts of the village.  It is great fun and I was so surprised whe&ntilde; it was suddenly over.  It did not give me any indication that there was another part to it.  I think this copy of mine just got out without this info.  However I can't download the update.  It just won't load.  Otherwise it is a tremendous game that I wish would just go on and on forever.

B00AB7HESI|4.0|This is a great game but if it's paid it should have at least a little more content. There are fifty levels but the levels only take a minute to beat so it takes less than an hour to beat the whole game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Was a bit sceptical about a game based solely on the concept of escaping a room. But, I tell you what, it was just challenging enough to make you have to work the old noggen. But not so hard you wanted to give up. Try it. It is really fun. I do plan on keeping this app on my Kindle Fire. I can't wait for the updates.

159514188X|5.0|From the first page to the last, I could not put this book down. It was so unpredictable and I could not wait to find out what happened next. When the story was over I was disappointed that it ended because I wanted to keep reading! Definitely one of the best books I have ever read. It is honestly onle of those books that will make you think about the way you view things and could change your life.

B004XUMMFE|4.0|A classic space opera, complete with good guys, bad dudes, ladies of shady repute, guns, saloons, escapes from the law, shady dealings. In short, everything one might expect from a mix of Star Wars and Gunsmoke.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Let me start with the hot button: torture. It's in the movie. Done. Regardless of your view on any politics or human rights issues, this is a compelling movie. The need to live on the edge to locate information and hope (often without hope) that something will pan out is riveting. You're waiting for the next tidbit to plug into the &#34;big picture&#34; puzzle. Weighing the value of intel and the source is not as easy as it may sound. Jessica Chastain's character's development from a wide-eyed newbie to a focused (obsessed? fanatical?) terrorist hunter is the center point of the movie. She gets her man in the end but only after a long, winding and costly path. Character development could have been deeper for some of the ancillaries (Seal team, terrorists providing intel, etc.) as far as what drives them, what makes them tick. This is a solid, suspenseful drama.
193700788X|5.0|As sad as I am that this is the final &#34;episode&#34; of the Sookie Stackhouse novels I congratulate Ms Harris on the way she has drawn the series to an end.<br /><br />Not wishing to spoil it for anyone yet to read this book let me just say that I could hardly put it down and completed reading it within 2 days of receiving it from Amazon!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Having been alive during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, and remembering the sentiment at the time, this was an excellent movie. I was not aware (or don't recall the news stories) of the 6 Americans smuggled out, so there was some historical significance to me. Ironically, I knew of Tony Mendes from hearing about his book and his legendary status at the CIA. The boldness of the mission itself and the behind the scenes political and administrative machinations were intriguing. Adding to the drama was the ridiculousness of Hollywood in the late 70's (or of Hollywood in general) where a few good men did what their government needed them to without blowing it. Thankfully, there was no TMZ or Perez Hilton back then. Once in Iran, the suspense and feeling of claustrophobia for the 6 Americans are palpable. They're stuck in a house for months, unable to go outside, waiting to be saved or to die. When they're days away from escaping, will the maid sell them out? Will the Iranian citizens storm the ambassador's house? Will the citizens sense that they're not who they claim to be? Will they make it through the airport? Affleck did a tremendous job with this project and it deserves all the accolades it has received.

0823003590|4.0|The author's choice of materials (particularly the partnering of CarbOthello pencils with Starathmore's 'Charcoal' paper) is particularly inspirational: just pick up a CarboOthello  #645 or #100 and feel the quality of the mark going onto the paper! In the first chapter, he makes good points about chiaroscuro and sfumato. Thereafter, he preaches good, practical technique(s).<br />However, after that, it's just work, work, work!
B008J1QFLU|5.0|The set is a dream for Wagner fans for his 200th birthday year. It's extravagant packaging houses CD and Blu-ray recordings of the complete Ring cycle sung by old-school singers and an orchestra with the music in their blood. Solti tends toward the heavy sounding, pre-Boulez crash/bang approach, and it works. If any pieces prove that great music can sound good in a variety of performance styles that have integrity, the Ring Cycle does just that. Szell tends to be lighter, Furtwangler is heavier, Solti is somewhere in between  -- and they are all convincing and enjoyable so long as they are well-played, heartfelt and in the service of the composer's music. This set, with the performance, the commentary, the full libretto and excellent presentation is a joy. I have it on LP and would not part with this  new  set. Many bonuses are included - commentary, recording session footage, annotated score fragments, posters, and wonderful performances of other Wagner pieces made during the period when this Ring recording was being produced. The Siegrfried Idyll by itself  is a treasure, full of Viennese, virbrato-laden playing that works because it is also flawless in execution. I had to purchase three copies before I got it right. The first was listed as \\"Used-Like New\\" from Amazon Warehouse on Amazon Prime. It certainly was used, but hardy \\"Like New\\". The major container box was scuffed and torn - staple or packing knife marks, I could't tell which - some of the many CD's had thumb-prints - and the Blu-ray disk with the entire Ring would not play properly on either on my two Samsung Blu-ray players. I received a prompt return auth and pre-paid shipping label from Amazon Prime and got a prompt and full refund. My second purchase was from an Amazon listed third party vendor.  It was advertised as new, but arrived with the shrink-wrap burst and the presentation box crushed in one corner. The seller insisted it was new when it left his shop and he would \\"kick some butt\\" in his shipping department. He sent me a return auth but no prepaid shipping label; he issued a refund that did not include the return shipping fee I paid to UPS. He said that the Amazon refund system would not allow him to refund the return UPS charge; I had to resort to including \\"fraud alert\\" on my seller feed-back to get him to refund the $31.46 I spent on return UPS. The refund, that he somehow got processed when he said that it could not be done was marked as a \\"goodwill\\" refund, as if I wasn't really entitled to it. Yuk, what an ugly experience! Finally, I ordered a full-price copy from Amazon Prime. I ordered in on a Saturday, it arrived on the following Monday(!), inside of a snug fitting factory-labled cardboard box inside of a well-packaged shipping box. The contents were brand new, shrink-wrapped,  and in perfect condition - it smelled new and the spines on the books cracked as I turned the pages. The disks all play perfectly and sound magnificent. Now that I have the set to keep, I loaded them into iTunes and they play back at 48hz through my Apple TV attached to my Sony HDMI receiver. Heavenly. My advice is buy this and don't try to skimp on price as I did the first times. This is worth going long for, and with Amazon Prime you have an assurance that your investment will be rewarded with a VERY SATISFYING product. It turned out to be a happy Father's Day!!

The good thing about the Kindle is that a printed Bible weighs about the same, (well, the Kindle probably weighs less), but you can carry about a thousand versions of the Bible in the Kindle.  This one is King James, but there are many other varieties that you can also download for FREE! See - there are people out there that care about you, and they give away FREE Bibles!

I had alarms off and on all day keeping me on track and learned I have tons of time to do the things I want to do if I only get all the chores out of my way. It became bothersome to others so I uninstalled for awhile. When I really needed an alarm while on vacation, re-installed only to find it doesn't always go off when its supposed to.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I haven't completely mastered the art, but it is easy to put together & understand. It does what it says it will do!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy had my attention from the very first page! The more I read, the more intrigued I became. A fast and interesting read. Last book started out a bit slow....but it was worth it.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|I don't think there is a song on this album that I don't love!  Capital Cities is such a fun band!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Three of us watched it and we all had the same reaction. The story line was unique, the acting was perfect and the chemistry between the characters was beautiful, but the ending, holy cow..it was shocking and touching at the same time.<br />We all simply loved this movie. I think it was by far the best love story I have seen in a long while.<br />5 BIG STARS for all three of us.
B008GVSOCQ|5.0|Who doesn't love Sense And Sensibility?! I've seen just about every version of this movie that there is, and this remains my favorite!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I like the way this cover is made. You can also prop it up in the back which my son does when he watches videos on the Kindle. Well made and good quality!
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Another typical Nicholas Sparks movie, However, this one wasn't nearly as depressing as Dear John, because let's face it, girls are watching these movies for the sweet love story that ends perfectly, lol. Unlike the other Nicholas Sparks movies I've seen, this one actually had an element of suspense which was a nice change of pace.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book shows how a Doctor who didn't believe in heaven, first hand witnessed that there is a heaven.  It was good but Randy Alcorn's book Heaven is even better.
B00377E5R2|5.0|I don't usually like remakes of old movies, and I thought it would be close to impossible to top the version with Audrey Hepburn, but I actually liked this one better. :)
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Excellent series, always funny and has some social point to make into the bargain.<br />So far have seen all that is available and recommend it as a good enjoyable comedy.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I think it was a very good game to play because the animals really look like how they were in the movies and I saw one of the ice age movies not to long ago and as I was watching I was saying the animals names because when you buy an animal on the game it shows you the picture and the name for example the sneaky. On the Kong fu scrat game you shouldn't have to wait so long for and elephant coin and you should have more acorns in the snow piles. But this is a good review.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I bought this album the day it was released. I've been constantly listening to Red ever since and I haven't gotten tired of listening to it yet.<br /><br />Red was one of my favorite albums of 2012, and \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" was my second favorite song of 2012 (behind Gotye's song, \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\").  It's one of the few whole albums that I have on my MP3 player.<br /><br />What I like about Taylor Swift is that she has grown as an artist with each album.  Sure, Red is more pop than country, and that's not a bad thing.  The songs that I like the most are the pop songs.<br /><br />My favorite songs:<br /><br />\\"State of Grace\\" - An upbeat song, great way to start the album.<br />\\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" - This is my favorite song on the album!<br />\\"I Knew You Were Trouble.\\"<br />The title track, \\"Red\\"<br />\\"The Lucky One\\"<br />\\"Holy Ground\\"<br />\\"Stay Stay Stay\\" - I love to hear Taylor's laugh at the end of the song, that tells me that she had fun recording it!<br />\\"I Almost Do\\"<br />\\"All Too Well\\"<br />\\"22\\"<br />\\"Begin Again\\" - A nice ballad that closes the album.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I debated whether to read this or not thinking it was going to be one thing only to find out It was not what I expected.  This book really moved me and I am so glad I did decide to read it.  I have told all my friends about it and think most people will like the book. The author did an excellent job with the characters and it was a real page turner.  I highly recommend this book- just in case you haven't figured that out by now. I mostly read mystery book but this was just a really good story...
B00003CXB4|5.0|This video surprised me with an extra song that was not in the original. The Lion King is always great!
B005DCJ1J6|3.0|Dr Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) is the resident doctor in an orphanage for unwanted children. One of the babies in his care he tries to have adopted but after a couple of failed attempts he names the boy Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) and decides to keep him at the orphanage. The boy shows an interest in Larch's work and Larch uses him as his assistant when he grows up. Larch is primarily an obstetrician, but is also willing to perform abortions of unwanted babies. Homer assists Larch in this for several years but does not approve, so he leaves and joins a group of black migrant workers working in a cider factory. When he arrives, Wells takes it upon himself to establish a set of rules of conduct for the community. One of the women on whom Dr Larch performs an abortion is the lovely Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), who has become pregnant by Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd). When Homer meets Candy again with Worthington overseas, the two develop a relationship, but when Worthington sustains a crippling injury, Candy feels she must stay with him on his return home. The black community resent having rules imposed on them by Wells, but when one of the workers, Arthur Rose (Delroy Lindo), impregnates his own daughter who dies from complications of having an abortion, Rose realises the wisdom of imposing some rules for the community to live by. The acting was good in this interesting human drama about conscience and relationships, but I didn't find it an engrossing movie. For one thing it was too long.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Started out slow but picked up the pace nicely- we are Michael Connelly fans so its hard for the movie to be as good as the book-
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What I said about season 3 also goes for seasons 2 and 1 in my opinion. This is a well produced, directed and acted series.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Probably the single most influential science fiction show since Star Trek, Stargate SG-1 showed us a &#34;space traveling&#34; science fiction show could be fun, fantastic and long running. This is a show worth watching over and over again. I miss it on TV and I'm glad we have it here on Amazon so we can enjoy it once more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started by watching season 1 and got &#34;hooked&#34; on the characters and story line. I've now continued by watching seasons 2 and 3 and am eagerly awaiting season 4 which will commence in January 2014. I understand this series has been the highest rated show on PBS and I can understand why. The characters are believable and thereby make the story line believable as well. Downton Abbey gives us a glimpse of the life of English aristocracy in the early years of the 20th century, which lifestyle had the same foibles as our own citizenry in this country.
B004MPEFBE|5.0|I love Harry Potter! I just got the digital version of the movie  so I can watch it on my kindle!!
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Story is incomplete, stops at the finding of Roy's lawyer dead., How do I get the rest of the story ?
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Somewhat predictable, but as with Gillian Flynn, still a very interesting twist. Great book. Couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This was an interesting movie and did not reveal the true plot until the very end.  It certainly confirmed some of my thoughts about the pill pushing that goes on between practitioners and the big drug companies---it is still a problem!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed reading this excellent book.  Well written and well thought out.  Hope to read more from this author and look forward to his next book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is like 100 floors but better because you can apply logic and actually figure these out. I hope there are at least 100 levels.
B005Z9MH98|5.0|The best of the best, with a true story that tugs at your heart-strings.  A must have for your collection, and a must see if you never have.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book! Especially epilogue and getting to know grey, I would love a book written through his perspective
B002BSHWUU|5.0|You could spend years trying to collect this complete selection of all of the Beatles cds, but why waste your time, buy this set and your done.  And it sounds totally awesome as well !
B006LSZECO|4.0|I like mysteries, but love the ones witha lighter twist - not grisley.  This fit the bill. Very engaging, but witha fun though predictable twist.  I liked it.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Gotta love Mad Max, and this is the whole collection in one easy to keep set.  AAAAA+++++ collection of Mel Gibson at his best.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Although not &#34;heavy-all-time-classic&#34; it is well- worth reading because it portrays, in surprising and thoughtful ways, how life works.  We all have &#34; luggage&#34; we carry, hardly knowing how we managed to pack it, much less how or if we can unpack it.  Early on, you will probably ask, &#34;could this have happened?&#34;  As the characters are revealed and as they develop, the answer is &#34;yes&#34;.  The reader has a new look at his or her life.  Unpacking luggage is what brings freedom and a new lease on life.
B008LH4YYC|3.0|I like the fact that I can one click and save memory.  Wish it was automatic.  I am really lazy
B009RH9FR6|3.0|It makes a rather hefty package to hold and carry.  I would prefer a lighter weight, simple cover to protect the Kindle.
B0063IH60K|4.0|WHAT CAN U SAY BOUT SOLITARE? IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF FREE TIME ON UR HANDS THIS IS THE GAME FOR U.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I'm an American but I say &#34;OK&#34; only because of it being an &#34;English&#34; language movie.  As I've said before, I have trouble making sense of their words (lines) whenever the genuine dialog is used and often have to employ sub-titles.  I know many Brits in real life and have no problems understanding them!<br /><br />The movie is well acted by all and the storyline is honest and very good, it allows for more films to follow.  It does need work in the audio department, it goes up and down from loud to soft.
B005PMNBPY|3.0|My friend recently turned me on to Strays which I had but didn't care for after a few listens. I can say that after giving that album another chance I do rank it up there with the early stuff. My first JA album was Nothings Shocking and I was hooked from there on out. This new outing has a super overproduced sound which you will have to get used to. Upon first listen I was not happy and posted a one star review (it's always best to give a few listens!) After hearing it a few more times I must admit I really like the first three songs as well as Splash Some Water On It and Broken People as well. This is a worthy effort of the band but go in with an open mind not expecting it to live up to the earlier masterpieces. Three point five stars.
B00BLGZN1S|3.0|I say that only because of it being an English flick, I have trouble understanding when that dialog is used.
B004W1GCQO|1.0|Contrived and acting was not good. Could not finish watching. Only watched about 3 episodes.<br />Cannot recommend. Just watch the original again or for the first time if you have never seen it! Its worth it but this one \\"not so much!\\"
030758836X|2.0|This was an extremely involving plot, with two equally hatable people! There was no resolution at the end, which was vey unsatisfiying, even though the author clearly seemed to believe that was forthe best.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is such a great book.  I will probably read it again because I enjoyed it so much.  Very emotional and moving.
0316017930|5.0|I have recommended or given this book to at least a dozen friends or family.  I realized that many of us are Outliers in some ways, and that we should be proud of that.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|enjoyed this a lot. there weren't a lot of surprises but the plot moved along nicely and kept me wanting to come back to see how things were going to be resolved.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I haven't been this excited with a TV show since Harper's Island on CBS years ago. I am on the edge of my seat every week!
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Works.  Nothing special.  Should have a number display right on the icon.  Don't understand what is &#34;pro&#34; about this app.
B009AP2G26|4.0|I realize they have to trade out characters as kids only get 4 years in high school. That said, it would be nice to get some &#34;new&#34; characters instead of younger versions of the original. Even the first episode of the season is called &#34;The New Rachel.&#34;  The repeat of shy girl, mean cheerleader, jock, outcast, gay guy, etc, is getting old. Where is the creativity? I watched every episode of previous seasons but found myself having a ho-hum attitude about these, often going weeks without bothering to watch. Unless their audience evolves as quickly as kids go through high-school, I anticipate this show will fizzle out after season 6, which Fox has confirmed renewal for.<br /><br />I do love the positive story lines, the way tough issues are addressed, and the generation of conversation that comes with the show. For that, I bumped it from 3 to 4 stars.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app wouldn't even open. It doesn't even go to the log in screen. Very dissapointing. You would think since Facebook is a big thing they would have an app that would work.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read these after my kids did and was enthralled by the stories. I'll simply reiterate what others have said in that the ending was too predictable and formulary. As a closing to a great series, it was lacking.<br /><br />I almost didn't purchase this after reading the reviews, but I had to have closure ;)  I'd buy it again (I got it on Kindle), but wouldn't buy it in hardback as it isn't one I'll read more than once.
B0000048ZL|5.0|the most wonderful movie ever - I love the romance and love these two shared - I have watch this movie a dozen times
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|A great new take on Sherlock. You'll likely find him to be arrogant and irritating, but he grows on you. When you are &#34;just that good,&#34; being humble almost seems wrong. The female Watson, played by Lucy Lui is different but interesting. So much happens in the first season, I'm wondering how they could possibly keep me engaged for season 2, but I look forward to finding out this fall.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|this is one of the best movie ever - saw it at the theater with my granddaughter but had to own it
B009GX7IRA|5.0|After ten years, I'm still hooked. Rare for a TV series these days. Yes, it follows a formula (dead marine/officer/etc., get your gear, investigate, catch the bad guy), but if you love the show it's probably not because of the weekly plot line. It's the character development that holds me and makes me wait for the next episode. The murder mystery aspect has actually migrated to become the sub-plot and the characters' interaction and changes over time are the thread that keeps me coming back. Most of the weekly story could be overlooked and wouldn't be missed from week to week, but the character evolution is significant enough that I hate to watch an episode out of order. If by chance you are new to the series and like a few episodes, go back and watch it from the beginning if you can.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|My son loves this game!! It is very easy for him to play. I had it on my Android phone and decided to download it to my Kindle Fire HD. Good game!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've never been a fan of soap operas and unless my husband had pointed out that this qualifies as one, would continue to argue I never waste time on them. That said, the actors are far superior to American soaps' and the richness and detail of the sets, costumes and characters is incredible. This might sound implausible, but I actually think my diction is improving from watching this. I find I work harder to enunciate and my vocabulary usage has expanded. I'm not learning new words mind you, but something about listening to the Queen's English makes one want to sit up a little straighter and speak with clarity. I forget how lazy our day to day American English can be.<br /><br />As to the specifics of Season 3, I was disappointed in the ending, as were many. Without spoiling it for those who haven't watched, I'll just say that characters were written out for actors that no longer wanted to be part of the show. I hope the momentum continues with season 4 coming soon.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have tried at least a half dozen list apps, and never liked any of them.  Then one day, I asked on my facebook what list app my friends were using.  The almost unanimous answer was Evernote.<br /><br />I downloaded the app, and have loved it ever since.<br /><br />I love the ability to sync between all devices.  The only bad part of that was that it wore down the battery on my cell phone in only 8 hours.  The fix was easy, and now it just syncs once a day unless I push an important sync through.<br /><br />This is the last list app I will ever need!
B003SHUMRI|4.0|This movie is full of typical plot lines line &#34;uptown girl falls for downtown guy,&#34; and &#34;bad boy rises up from his background.&#34; That said, it works and it's fun to watch. If you are looking for deep character development or rich plots, this is not for you. But it's entertaining for a rainy Saturday afternoon or to watch on a boring flight.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Some people were upset by all the post production used.  But I think the tools were well used and the sound is great.  I only wish I will perform as good when I'm in my 60's.  This package had exactly what I wanted in it.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Love the characters, love the plot. Though there are times when I have to refrain from watching it as it can be disturbing. Sadly, a man in my town recently murdered his girlfriend and, in what the police are describing as an effort to copy the show, put her body in a tub of acid. I do wonder if the show actually offers tips to criminals (thus the reason I call it a guilty pleasure), but the character development is exceptional.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I am surprised at the amount of negative reviews that this movie has gotten. The movie was well done. Funny, Family friendly, and in the end just a good fun film. Ads well to the original story and answers a lot of questions the original may have left you with.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I fell in love with the first book after taking my kids to the movie and feeling the need to read the book. This is a good sequel but left you in too-obvious &#34;wait for the next book&#34; territory. I don't mind when a book leaves the story open to a sequel, but I prefer authors not take a single story and chop it in half to force the purchase of the next book. That's what I felt here. If you like the first one, read this one, but have book 3 on hand as you'll want to pick it up shortly after. Speaking of book 3, you might check the reviews on that before you commit yourself to book 2.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book is a fast reading.  I liked the first part of it and continued reading hoping for a resolution. But nothing happened.  The second and the last part felt fake.  I finished the last page with a feeling of wasted time.
B001NA6096|4.0|This little romance was slow getting started. It did capture my interest. The scenery and setting in Vienna was a good choice for filming. It really picked up in the last 40 minutes and captured my wife and my interest. We will be watching the sequels.
B008458O3S|5.0|My oldest (6) is a train fanatic! I grabbed this because it looked like something he might like. He likes it a lot but it's his younger brother (3) that is just bonkers for it. They have a Galaxy Tab 7 to use and the youngest will spend entire waiting room visits locked into this game and completely happy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun puzzles getvyour mind going. interactive real life situations are fun. I only wish there was a hint option for the tough ones.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I didn't want him clicking ads or whatnot in the free version. Seems to be identicle just ad free. It's a cute little physics game my 6 year old and husband alike enjoy.
B001R3YRG2|1.0|I give this DVD a failing grade, not because of the theatrical movie itself. Hell's no ! The movie was excellent !!! I am giving a bad rating because of the DVD format of this Deluxe Edition alone & that this DVD is presented in a centered rectangular mannered widescreen formatted version of this movie being extremely discriminative towards classic full screen box screen TV's like mine. Yeah, I have a box screen Tv still. So what. it still works perfectly. If it ain't broke, don't replace it. Right ? My box screen Tv works fine.<br />Anyways, there is nothing Deluxe about this movie at all other than the expected usual documentary of how the movie is made, which usually comes standard on most, if not the majority of un-Deluxe versioned movies on DVD as a whole.<br />I have been more successfully happy with the other DVD for which the DVD cover shows Michael Douglas standing on a small few feet tall brick wall of sorts with a baseball bat in one hand & a briefcase in the other hand with tall buildings in the background behind him while he stands on a few step perch. The original released DVD format. That is the one & only version you & everyone would be more happy with. This Deluxe Edition only offers a scrunched up smaller size film with dark bars on the top & bottom of the screen with the film in the center of the Tv screen. For widescreen owners, this movie might be a great fit, but for box screen Tv owners like myself, this here Deluxe Edition of this movie is not worth the money. The movie, again, is excellent, but I would ask everyone to invest in the other released DVD that offers both Widescreen & reverse side Full Screen formats. What I do is I turn over the disc once purchased & I put a CD / DVD label on the Full Screen side of the disc for easier handling & where I can print out the name of the movie title & paste the label on the DVD itself manually. That solves my dislike for the bias discriminative widescreen format that only tailors itself to widescreen Tv's for which I do not own. Again, 5 stars for the movie, but it never asked about how I liked the movie. It asked me \\"How I rated this item\\" not how I rate this movie popularity-wise. Which refers to the DVD itself & with the DVD they are referring to the presented format & any & all contents of this physical DVD as a whole. The format stinks in my opinion only because I don't own & cannot afford a widescreen Tv & my box Tv works just fine still, but the movie is great if you would just buy & invest into the other first initial DVD release of this movie. The normal optional full & wide screen choice version of this movie release. That is the best DVD to buy. At least you can choose from full screen , box TV's etc. , or widescreen for widescreen Tv buffs. The other DVD caters itself to both format preferences & all owners are mutually & respectively satisfied with either format.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I just hope that the actors team up to make more of these excellent movies<br />What else can I say?
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I found this an excellent read, with much new detailed information even though I thought I knew this period of American history. Anyone with interest in the years between the world wars, or American history in general, would appreciate this book. My compliments to author Lynne Olson.
B003L77FYS|5.0|If you enjoy Nathan and Stana you will surly enjoy this third season.They make for a winning combination.<br />etc,etc.period.<br />And that concludes my reviews.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|I would presume that most Americans are as unfamiliar with Balkan history as I am, so the opening chapters that detail the twists and turns of political maneuvering in the Balkans more than a century ago are slow going. Almost all the names of the political figures were unfamiliar to me. Now that I have moved beyond that segment of the book, I am in more-familiar terrain with the major European figures of the time and learning as I go.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I'm a die-hard Kanye fan, but like most fans I wasn't sure what to expect of his latest project from the outset.  'Yeezus' is a sonic assault, a disturbing, metallic, grimy symphony of rage and distortion.  Even if you end up loving this album you'll probably finish your first play through wondering what the hell just happened.  Like 808s and MBDTF, Kanye isn't content to operate inside of his comfort zone and 'Yeezus' pushes the listener deep into uncharted territory.<br /><br />Will you be disappointed and demand your money back?  Maybe, but like Kanye himself longtime fans should roll the dice on this one.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I've been trying to piece together the Weeknd's music only to find it finally show up on Amazon's mp3 collection a while back.  Arguably the most relevant R&B singer-poets of this decade, listeners will find he mixes haunting lyrics with the smoothness of a crooner circa 60's.<br /><br />With powerful songs like Rolling Stone, The Birds, Wicked Games, you feel as if you're being lulled into the brackish depths of moral grey zones.  With a few covers of &#34;High For This,&#34; from other singers like Ellie Goulding and Birdy, you should know the source.  I can't even begin to praise the powerful cover of MJ's &#34;Dirty Diana.&#34;<br /><br />While The Weeknd doesn't always make for great &#34;anytime&#34; music, it is certainly the most evocative of &#34;mood&#34; music.  You can crank this in the car late night or pour up your favorite scotch at home.  It certainly sets you in a particular zone.
B001EC0OMM|4.0|Feel-good movie with great actors. Funny and very enjoyable. The scene with Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart when Jimmy gets the hiccups was not planned when filming, and you can see Cary Grant trying not to lose it when they are talking.
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|I'm torn because I really want to rave about this like everyone else, but the music is so understated that it's actually underwhelming.  What Daft Punk has done with this album is demonstrate their mastery of their craft by essentially performing an era of music with alacrity.  In the process of showing their skill, I feel the album itself suffers from the impact of its predecessors.  Honestly, no song sounds bad, yet no song sounds truly awesome.<br /><br />&#34;Get Lucky&#34; was obviously their single smash, but I doubt much else will grace the airwaves except the most dedicated of EDM stations.<br /><br />Listen to the album, but download the single unless you're an old-school robot head like me.
B001V7SME2|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's one of the few movies where you care about the characters. I'm reading the book this was based from and so far it follows the book very closely. My opinion is that the movie is more about Oskar's and Eli's relationship than it is about vampires. If you're already looking at this on amazon then just watch it. I can't speak highly enough about this movie.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've been hearing good things about this series so I finally watched it. I love watching sci-fi any sci-fi watcher will love this. I was curious how the can change The Doctor, found out during the last scene of the last episode of season 1. Can't wait to start the next season.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put this book down. It touched on so many aspects of the human experience; relationships,family,fears,denial.  Absolutely excellent!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The movie was just ok, though it did have a good ending. Spoiler alert: there's a great twist. Also, Catherine Zeta Jones was over-acting.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled  Hosseini is a gifted writer and an imaginative story-teller.  To cover 60+ years of stories that interrelate through families makes for a fascinating read.  I just finished and want to reread it already!
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|The second season is not as good as the first. The plots have some minor flaws in it. But it is good entertainment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a nice game and I really did like it but I don't have patience but very challenge game
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very good series. A little too far fetched at times but it makes a good story. Enjoy the banter between the two stars.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I started watching this series after much nagging from my friends. After watching one episode it was obvious why everyone keeps saying you'll be hooked. Season one was wonderful, it made me laugh, cry, and I absolutely fell in love with the characters. Acting and story lines are all great. Would recommend to anyone!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a movie u will want to watch over and over again. But be sure to watch the seperate movies first cause they all rie in together.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Being influenced by the documentary, I then purchased \\"Cold Fact\\"  and \\"Coming from Reality\\". In an age where music lacks substance and fails to evoke anything but headaches, one can't help but feel as if a lost treasure was found... Indeed, his music is rich, and hopefully Rodriguez can spend the rest of his days knowing that ultimately, he was greatly appreciated and influential
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good final book . Not sure I liked the ending. I have read other books where the story was going along well ,then it's like the author realized they had an appointment to go to and rush the ending. The ending didn't seem to fit the character either . Hopefully they will rethink the ending for the movie . Still I would recommend the series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It goes to show loves endurance through the trials presented in the book. I enjoyed Grace standing up to Elena and showing her motherly love towards Christian.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|This is an excellent concert from and excellent European band.  The double bass drums really pound my chest with my subwoofer.  One of the best new live concerts I have seen from one of the best new bands.  I could go on and on, but will not.  If you like Kamelot at all you should really buy this DVD.  It has spent the most amount of time in my DVD player over about 10 other concert DVD's that are not as good.
B006LUCV4Q|5.0|engrossing melodies. great voice, heard on Echos and had to buy it. helps me excape the mundane worth a listen
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Great player. I can watch all my favorite movies anywhere now. The easy of use with Mobo is so simple, even for someone who has no computer knowledge.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This series is Showtime only so can be much more graphic and tough than even 'regular' cable programs. It keeps you guessing and develops characters more than 'regular' dramas. I watched the comments by the writers, producers and actors on the DVD. They really helped to increase my enjoyment of the series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It is so nice having an alarm like this. I'm never without it. For road trips or just those important dates you don't want to<br /> miss.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a large screen calculator that is very convenient to have on your Kindle.  It's always right there when you need it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Although the Fire has a battery life indicator.  This app accurately lets you know the exact percentage of life is left.  It is much easier to see than the built in feature.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I understand the disappointment expressed by many reviewers. This is not a BlueRay quality you may expect based on other more recent releases, But the overall quality played on BlueRay player is OK and for the special price that is far less that for 6 single DVDs (not even BlueRays) it is a good buy.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has everything I love about my childhood. There are literally 3-4 books I'll buy and read more than once. I read this one 5 times before I finally bought it for my kindle.
B00003CX95|5.0|Epic. Excellent cast, story, scenery, action in battle. So much treachery on the part of the English King, Longshanks, and the Scottish nobles who curried wealth and land by plotting with him. It was up to the common Scots, led by William Wallace (Mel Gibson), to free Scotland of English occupation. And what a reminder is the cry of \\"Freedom\\", considering the world of 2013 with NSA, the National Security Agency, collecting every phone call and email of citizens of the U.S. It feels like we've become guilty until proven innocent. Any freedom loving people would have to reject Big Brother, Big Sister, and tell them to butt the hell out. William Wallace had it right. We should have such courage.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|I read and loved the book. The skeleton of the book is in the movie but that's it. However, the movie is pretty good.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|All of the kids loved this cartoon, very funny without a lot of words. The adults loved it too. Very good.
1781162646|5.0|I love coming of age stories, and this is by far one of the best. Once again, King has cross genres and did it very well.
B002WSASIC|5.0|Very interesting, learned quite a bit. the really wild thing is that this is real and could be happening everywhere.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Very insightful treatise, covers both the political complications and the personal relations of this crucial period.<br /><br /> four more words required
B001NLKS16|4.0|I wasn't surprised to see all the lore in this book. It is John's journal after all. But I found it got in the way of the reason I bought it. I wanted to see his thoughts and relationships with the boys, which I got. I found a new respect for John, whom I did not care for for the longest time, after reading this book. I just wish I didn't have to skim through so much lore to find it.
B005HSL626|5.0|Get ready to slice, dice, and chop all sorts of fruits and watch out for those bombs.  I picked this one up since I had heard from friends that it was a lot of fun for the kids.  They enjoy playing it and trying to see which one of the will slice up the most fruit.  So very glad this version is free - not sure what the full pay version has different from this one.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Love the annimation and moral in the movie. The characters are unique and I watch it over and over again!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|On one level, this is an action-adventure film about a boy and a tiger stranded on a boat.  But if it's approached that way, the beginning and ending of the film seem hard to reconcile.  This film presents a question that gets to the heart of religious faith in a way that both the believer and the non-believer can appreciate.  It's about all religions, not just one.  Pi is serially attracted to several of the world's major faiths, but the unique dogma of each is not the appeal.  It's the idea of religion that is the subject of the film.  Soon after the scene is set, Pi endures a terrifying ordeal involving a tiger and a lifeboat.  When it's over, he tells his story to skeptical investigators.  What has really happened here?  By posing the question the way it does the film offers an answer that tries to unravel the nature of faith and the purpose of belief.  I can think of far less interesting ways of spending two hours than watching this beautiful, challenging and thought-provoking film.<br /><br />The story of the making of the movie (in the blu-ray edition) is as fascinating as the movie itself.  Yes, it's (mostly) a digital tiger, but the technology simply does not reveal itself.  At all.  Side-by-side footage of the real tiger and the digital one are indistinguishable.  This is one case in which the work put into the making of the film is justified by the depth and beauty of the story.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|At present this is my go to game.  It's my favorite while traveling.  I like trying to best my previous score
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love carefully engineered technical solutions that really work. This certainly meets that criteria in every respect. I would not be without it!  Another great Amazon app.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Liked the story line it was a twisted plot but made the reader root for the prisoner.  Couldn't wait to see the real culprits get there just deserves.  The ending was happy and what I wanted it to be.
0761169431|5.0|My son loves oragami and is very advanced.  He had so much fun we sometimes had to interrupt to get other things done
B0068FYZCA|4.0|This is such a great movie to watch.  It is so funny and such  a wonderful trip down memory lane, to see it again.  I loved seeing the actors again that I grew up watching on Happy Days, One Day at a Time, and Star Wars.  The music is upbeat and nostalgic too.  My teenagers enjoyed watching the movie too, and my husband and I were able to share about the &#34;good old days&#34; when as teenagers  we cruised the avenue with our friends.
B006IVBSBU|5.0|I read an amazing book awhile back entitled \\"The Hot Zone,\\" which I believe is mostly a non-fiction account of how a new strain of Ebola spread from Africa to the east coast of the United States.  The virus was contained, but just barely.  The potential consequences, laid out very nicely by the author of that work, were quite dire.  And so far for me, this film is the closest disaster-type film that demonstrates this same idea, albeit in pictures instead of words.<br /><br />I hate to flog a dead horse -- OK, so I lied -- but I wrote a review of the film \\"The Impossible\\" awhile back.  After I wrote that review, I was skewered by ad hominems and appeals to emotion by other viewers, obviously logical fallacies to the logicians out there.  But anyways, I juxtaposed that film in a review of \\"Aftershock\\" later, where I argued that the survivors in the former were impossibly kind, while the survivors in the latter were impossibly cruel.  I also wrote that I enjoyed \\"Aftershock\\" more because at least it showed human behavior more correctly in a time of crisis.  But this film is probably right in-between the two, and I believe that the looting and crime that they show here are spot-on in believability.<br /><br />And even Matt Damon, who usually plays the nice guy in most of his roles -- minus of course his role in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" (a film that I also really liked) -- actually does a little Bad-Will-Hunting here himself.  Even he breaks at one point as his family needs food and supplies, and so the film shows him breaking into a neighbor's house and rummaging through that neighbor's refrigerator.  Ah, I say that, given enough pressure, you could even break Mother Teresa (assuming she were still alive), and I even have some proof of that:  she endured an exorcism herself before she passed away.  Perhaps the Devil was able to break her.  \\"So there!\\" and \\"take that!\\" I say to you disbelievers out there of bad human behavior!<br /><br />Most disaster films just plain get it wrong.  \\"Contagion\\" just plain gets it right.  At least mostly so.  They show how the government tries to use disinformation to avoid a panic, and I also found this believable.  As a matter of fact, while watching, I was thinking about the whole asteroid thing that happened recently.  Supposedly, an earth-killer flew by at about a million miles away.  Luckily, it didn't hit us.  And the government was nice enough to tell us about it in advance, just as it was about to fly by at a very-safe-but-near-miss distance.  But I also thought the following:  what if the government knew that it WOULD have hit us?  Would they have given us that information?<br /><br />I believe they would have tried to hide it.  Americans are often biased to think that the government will divulge the information, but only since they have told us about the negative cases in the past.  Those are easy.  And after all, it took a contractor recently to spill the beans that the government is listening in on our phone conversations.  (I'm not much into conspiracy theories myself, but it's also wise to not completely discredit them out of hand.  Sometimes the government does bad things, such as save all of our emails, as an example.)<br /><br />Well, I say, \\"Contagion is Contagious!\\"  Maybe not as good as \\"The Hot Zone,\\" and perhaps more of a 4.5.  But I'm rounding up to a 5, since so many disaster movies are just so, well, disastrous, while this one is just so good.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|This is truly a classic. Love the romance and the whole plot of the movie. Would definitely recommend this for date night.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg gets to the heart of the most pressing gender issues in work and family life that prevent both men and women from achieving their goals and dreams without obstruction or judgment. This book is a powerful examination of the &#34;state of affairs&#34; in the gender wars, full of practical advice about how we can all play a part in finally achieving peace.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was so interesting, it was difficult to put down. The story was told through one Navy Seal but it is the telling of a team effort to complete their assignment. There is no sensationalism, just telling the events as they happened. The book explains why Osama was killed rather than taken alive. Reading this book it feels like you were right there with them. Highly recommend this book.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|Michael Giacchino is one of the great composers of movie scores of this generation. He is the next Jerry Goldsmith.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this series this one was the best.the love story between eva and gideon was amazing.  Great can't wait for the next one.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|fun way to kill time but could use a hint generator on some of the harder levels otherwise I would recommend it
B009P13RQY|4.0|I liked this album, and have listened to it over and over, but I still think that 'Age of Winters' or their self titled album had more inspiration behind them.  That being said, this album has no bad songs, and also ends with a bonus of a few live songs and a cover.  Pick it up.
B0010358CQ|5.0|I enjoy science fiction concepts about future societies were technology has helped people enjoy better lives, overcome damage to physical bodies with robotics, cloning to create better humans with no weaknesses and plain old good action sequences. I forsee a time when there is another major that nearly destroys the planet but a few visionaries still manage to hold society together and give hope for a better future. I would recommed DVD for your collection of the Appleseed chronicles.
B0063FGG22|5.0|THAT'S A MISTAKE. But buying this item wasn't. From a good film for many occasions to a memorable plot to some classic scenes, this film is worth owning. Also worth buying if you need to see how a suit should be properly worn.
B00BQI4AU6|2.0|Ozzy was wrong.  The road to nowhere leads to Tom Keifer.  This album goes nowhere.<br /><br />How I describe it:  Vocals by Tom Keifer, Lyrics by Celine Dion, Music by the latest dime-a-dozen countrified rock star.<br /><br />I wanted this based on Keifer's voice, and talent.  But, it's just a collection of trite, pointless recordings you will not remember.  He's also taken to incorporating a new, annoying vocal affectation on some songs where he sighs heavily, or hangs on the last word of a verse overlong.<br /><br />Hmmm, it occurs to me that if you like the trash Aerosmith was putting out once they got to their Crazy, Amazin', Cryin' era, you'll probably like this.  It's the same ball-less b.s.  Clich&eacute; and commercial.<br /><br />No one pushed this on me.  When I found out Keifer was making a solo album, I thought awesome!  I always imagined him to be the main creative force behind Cinderella's music.  I did not expect it to sound like Cinderella.  I had no expectations except that it would probably be good.  I can't get behind it...it did not move me in the least.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Not the best movie out but now a days good movies are hard to come by. Seems like everything is just a remake these days.
B00C7NKPPS|1.0|I'm disappointed with the fact that these two CDs were sent in a cardboard sleeve (no hard plastic CD case), where the CDs can slide out if not handled properly.  When I buy a new CD, I expect a plastic case.
0810979772|5.0|My son loved it and he was happy about it...he been writing it in from when we got it...He wanted it so bad and could not find in the store
1593082037|5.0|Loved the introduction to this Volume.  A background history on Mr. Doyle was very interesting.  I've always been fascinated with Sherlock Holmes and like the fact that so many of Doyle's stories are in this volume.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once I got into this game it was hard to put it down. I killed my whole lunch hour paying.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son love this game, what's not to like? Downloaded this for my Kindle. Hours of fun - this mom needs to spend more time figuring it out. Or maybe not? :) I hear it's addicting.
B000TEPKS4|4.0|This is a pretty good record.  I like the Band's second album (self-titled) better, but this one may grow on me as I listen to it more.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This is the kind of music that inspires, causes one to meditate and think. The artists are down to earth and<br />talented. I'd recommend the music to anyone interested in modern sounds
0062255657|5.0|I finished this book in two days.  I could not put it down.  Neil Gaiman writes like a shaman who takes you on a journey to find the magic that is hiding just around the corner.<br /><br />Written from the perspective of a seven-year-old boy, this book amazed me by making me feel his fear, sadness, wonder, and the trust that only a child can have.  Mr Gaiman, you are truly a hero of mine.  Thank you for writing stories that bring back the wonder that I felt as a child.  The wonder that knew the monsters in the closet were real, and that there are people who love you enough to do anything for you.
B00932A4XE|4.0|I recently had my second baby and my husband is a stay at home dad. This film, while not \\"art\\" resonates with me. I loved the small role Chris Rock played and the day's group generally was the highlight for me. Yes I've seen better movies but I've seen way worse too.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I can recall the moment when I saw the initial trailer for Kingdom of Heaven back when Ridley Scott was still riding on the coattails of Gladiator's success. What was promised was an epic adventure/drama that would rival the historical classics such as 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Ben Hur' and \\"Gladiator'. What movie audiences and critic's alike got was a watered down action adventure film that was bland, empty and made you wonder where the rest of the film had gone. Thankfully we have such a thing as the 'Director's Cut' which is a common misnomer due to the fact that many director's have little no power when it comes to what they want to keep in or cut from the theatrical release, as was the case with this film and the differences are worth the wait.<br /><br />For those of you who stomached their way through the theatrical release there is much to be salvaged upon viewing the now hour longer version of this film, which has been updated for Blu ray and DVD. What you get is a sometimes tragic yet epic look at the bloody history of the crusades which was ravaged with violence perpetrated in the name of religion and a unique character study of some very interesting and deep characters. This version takes a relatively 'run of the mill' action film and replaces it with a thoughtful look at religion, faith, and a world of ideas not much different than our own. The cast is tremendous all around with particularly good performances by it's supporting roles including: Edward Norton, David Thewlis, Liam Neeson, and Jeremy Irons. On Blu-ray the film looks tremendous on any television with gorgeous textures and visuals and audio to match. Running at a little over 3 hours Kingdom of Heaven is not one to be missed and is possibly one of Ridley Scott's best film to date. There are of course numerous differences to the plot but I'll those of you watch it without spoiling anything.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game. Very thought provoking. Only thing I would change is to have a bubble pop up and label what you pick up. Some things are hard to identify.
B00AK57N00|3.0|Gets a little monotonous after a bit.Probably a good program to keep kids busy rather than adults.Probably won't be using it that much.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Drives me crazy that I can't figure out how it is so accurate so quickly! Great game to amaze your friends and family.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Very good book I did not want to put it down. I found that all of the books I have read by Jodi Picoult are excellent
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fairly easy but you have to figure out what each clue means. ..then use the tool properly. I like it! Straitforward logic. Clever and satisfiying. Thanks.
B008MM9630|4.0|My granddaughter is 4 and likes to play this game but she does not really know what she is doing. I feel it is for someone a little older but she loves it.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Album is amazing! The production, lyrics, the entire package and presentation is superb! \\"Let Nas down\\" - Wow!! Excellent!! J. Cole dropped a jewel!!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Like most little girls my granddaughter of 4 loves putting on makeup and changing dresses. She loves this type of game.
B00D8WMASM|5.0|Album is amazing! The production, lyrics, the entire package and presentation is superb! \\"Let Nas down\\" - Wow!! Excellent!!  J. Cole dropped a jewel!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a hard-to-put-down book.  You will be drawn into the lives of the characters.  Interesting, interwoven life stories that bring the people and their country to life.  Loved this book.
B008602KQI|5.0|I did not read the book, so I'm sure there were nuances that I did not pick up in the movie. I struggled to understand what had happened that created the world that we enter in the movie. However, I thought the story and the characters were engaging. Contrary to what I thought might be the case, the heroine focuses on staying alive and assisting her friends rather than killing as many participants as she can.  I certainly will watch the next film (assuming that the sequel will be filmed) to see how things unfold!
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is fun and fast paced!  The only drawback is the inability to retry a level, you must re-try from the beginning.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read, hardly Amy drag , maybe a bit far far fetched .  But never pretended not to be . Great work , great author highly recommended
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie didn't &#34;grab me&#34; right away.  It took a little time to figure out what was going on between characters, but once into it, the movie was great.
