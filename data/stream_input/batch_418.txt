B0001UL7RY|2.0|ok...lets just get one thing straight here. this album is not any thing near being hardcore or rock. it's clearly pop! any one who says she has guitar driven music or an edge to her sound needs to consider buying a real hardcore cd. there are females out there who rock and avril is NOT one of them. her lyrics are fit for a two year old..take for example..&quot;this is when i start to bite my nails&quot;...&quot;walk around with your hands up in the air like u dont care&quot; (gag me!!) i bought this cd cause i read that it would be alot more &quot;hardcore&quot; than her last.  boy was i in for a surprize! her songs reminded me of something hillary duff might sing(who sux as well)<br />THIS IS NOT ROCK! may i suggest not buying this album if you disliked this girl before, or if you're looking for guitar driven rock edged music! u won't find that here. try distillers or kittie if u want a hardcore rock/punk vibed album.<br />i gave this album two stars because i had to give the girl some cred for at least trying to make a decent pop album. and thats what it is. pop. songs like &quot;take me away&quot; and &quot;forgotten&quot; may be the loudest tracks on here,but they're nowhere near being hardcore. more like a cheasy rip off of an evanescence song,minus the awesome vocals by amy lee. this girls voice can be so annoying at times. i mean come on girl..you're nearly 20!. stop singing like a two year old and actually try to right some decent/mature lyrics that fit someone more your age.  this girls act only works on an audience of nine year olds and posers.  any sane person would know that this is clearly NOT the best album ever made. sry to ruin your day! this album is not worth buying if you're a harcore/punk music fan, or even a rock fan for that matter. theres better music out there ppl. this little fake wannabe rebel is not as great as u think.<br />HAVE A NICE DAY!!!
0142004235|5.0|Steinbeck has managed to carry a biblical idea into the future, taking everyday characters and bringing them to life with ancient tradition while allowing his readers to see the commoness of man through both good and evil doings.<br />Not only is this book biblical in theory but it is biblical in proportion as well at 600 pages it is a testament to Steinbeck that he was able to sustain his idea for such a lengthy saga. I read the book voraciously and finished it within two weeks, a first for someone conducting a busy life. I will be forever haunted by the impressive characters I came to know so intimately in the pages of \\"East of Eden\\". Steinbeck mastered the art of transferring biblical characters into believable modern life, Adam and Eve, Moses, Cain and Abel etc... Steinbeck convinced me that all people hold within themselves a choice between good and evil and he further instilled in me the fact that I have a choice (timshel) to embark on whatever journey my soul so wishes. I once believed that evil stemmed from abuse or neglect but I am better able to realize now that evil sometimes is just inborn. Steinbeck's words make you question your own choices and prepare you to some extent for the outcome of those choices. Although a choice may seem easy today its repercussions can destroy you tomorrow. <br />I am amazed how this novel can actually apply to the modern day accusations about American life as well. I highlighted one paragraph and will refer to it often when I am finding that I have become spoiled by this American way of life, \\"Lee went on, `That's why I include myself. We all have that heritage, no matter what old land our fathers left. All colors and blends of Americans have somewhat the same tendencies. It's a breed-selected out by accident. And so we're overbrave and overfearful-we're kind and cruel as children. We're overfriendly and at the same time frightened of strangers. We boast and are impressed. We're oversentimental and realistic. We are mundaneand materialistic-and do you know of any other nation that acts for ideals? We eat too much. We have no taste, no sense of proportion. We throw our energy about like waste. In the old lands they say of us that we go from barbarism to decadence without intervening culture. Can it be that our critics have not the key or the language of our culture? That's what we are, Cal-all of us. You aren't very different\\" (Pg. 570).  As I search for connection in the world, not just as an American, but also as a human this paragraph says it all. We are a wasteful, ambitious and free nation that tends to exaggerate our excess and ignore our contribution to other nations in this world out of habit and a sense of security. These luxuries are something we have a choice to share or misrepresent. I can only pray that the novel of our lives ends with as much compassion and insight as did Steinbeck's, \\"East of Eden\\".
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album isn't just really good, it's the kind of album that could change your life. Open your eyes, for the Flaming Lips have put together another magical album that will stun you. Give the first track &quot;Fight Test&quot; a shot. On its own this one song is worth the money the whole album buys. From this first amazing track it only gets better. The first three tracks will amaze you, the fourth track will perplex you, the next few tracks take you somewhere else, and the final insturmental brings it all together in a way that makes you want to listen to it again. A truly addictive album. It may not change your life, but there's something magical about this album that keeps you comin back for more.
0393314804|4.0|I came to this novel after seeing the film. I read it, enjoyed it, and didn't think much else of it. I reread the novel in an English Lit class wherein we dissected the use of dialect, the choice to not have a central character, and the somewhat unredemptive closing. Trainspotting's tough going for the first few pages, but once you're accustomed to the varying dialects represented, you'll find yourselves entertained and shocked by the stories within. This novel is gritty and uncompromising in its representation of contemporary, Scottish, working-class youth, so if you're unfamiliar with the subject, or with Welsh's other works, take warning.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|With witty dialog, plots with actual surprise twists, an attractive cast, and interesting SF concepts, what's not to like? Add to this the fact that you quickly come to care for everyone in the series, and you NEED to see this show.<P>One of the best TV shows I've seen, and this set is more than complete, including all the episodes aired and some that were never shown, plus some nice extras. The Firefly movie, Serenity, comes out next spring (April 22, 2005). You want to be ready, don't you?
B000092ZYX|3.0|Hail to the Thief fails to reverse the downward trend in recent Radiohead releases.  Only two of the songs are flat-out brilliant (I will and Wolf at the door).  Another four or so that are really good.  After that, I could take or leave the rest.
078681859X|4.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been trying to find books in the meantime to carry me until the next book is released.  I bought this based on reviews here, as well as The Today Show.  I found the footnotes throughout the book extremely distracting and tiresome.  In most cases, they could have been incorporated into the text and sometimes were repititions of what the author had already stated.  Besides that though, I thought it was an enjoyable read, but I felt  like I was reading a pre-teen to teen novel, which I never felt while reading Harry Potter or even Eragon.  I did enjoy a new spin on the ability of magicians, in that, they had no power without summoning of spirits or demons.  Almost a genie in the bottle approach.  It will be interesting to see how this series continues and I will most likely get the second book.  As for recommendations: either get a used copy or borrow from a friend if you're an adult.  Or read your child's after they are through.
B00008YZYM|3.0|I absolutely love this movie. I've been waiting for this re-release to come out for a long time and am very disappointed to find it is not an anamorphic widescreen release. It actually says on the back of the packaging, &quot;Enhanced for 16X9 televisions&quot;. This is blatantly false. I have to wonder why Disney took the trouble to re-release this but couldn't be bothered to do it right. However, the picture quality was excellent for a non-anamorphic DVD.
0345404475|4.0|DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? is another classic science fiction novel that I only just got around to reading.  And once again, I find myself wishing that I'd gotten around to reading it earlier.  It was also my introduction to the writings of Philip K. Dick, and I also wish I had started exploring his output before now.  This novel demonstrates what science fiction can do at its best.  It tells an absorbing, thrilling story, but it also works on other levels.  <br />The book's protagonist is named Rick Deckard, and he's a police officer in a post-apocalyptic future whose job is to track down and destroy rouge androids.  Although this is clearly a science fiction work, I felt a strong flavor of noir creeping throughout the sections dealing with Deckard's career.  The trappings of the fantastic are present, but they're presented in a clearly thriller-type way.  Deckard may be a cop from the future, yet he owes a lot of his characterization to the hardboiled, fictional detectives who came before him.  This makes him an extremely entertaining character, as well as an immediately sympathetic one.<br />As has been noted, this novel is doing a little more than just telling another adventure story (although it does a great job at that).  While the themes of alienation and isolation and what it means to be a conscious, reasoning entity are well-developed and much discussed by readers, several other metaphors are also lurking beneath the surface.  This is a book very much influenced by its time (it was published 1968), but pieces of it seem almost timeless (the war which nearly destroys the world is caused by a right-wing policy group wielding too much influence at the Pentagon; boy, does that sound familiar).  The psychological testing done on the subjects to determine their identity (either human or robot) reminded me strongly of the infamous McCarthy hearings. <br />I was very impressed by the actual writing itself in this novel.  Dick's prose is very strong.  Science fiction writers often enjoy building up a new world/universe at the expense of characterization or plot, but that isn't the case here.  He excels at painting a bleak future, taking the attitudes of today and projecting them into a world with few people and fewer animals.  But he doesn't let this overwhelm the book.  It's a hard balance to maintain, yet he manages it well.  His satire is exactly what it should be: both hilarious and cuttingly accurate.  <br />Philip K. Dick is a writer that I've heard a lot of good things about, and I'm looking forward to diving deeper into his back catalog.  DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? impressed me in both its straightforward narrative and in the deeper topics that it touches on.  The \\"social commentary\\" aspect of the novel, which can be painful in books by lesser authors, is actually one of the book's best features.  There are a few sloppy points (the mechanical capabilities of the androids are a bit vaguely defined, and once or twice characters talk to themselves for no reason other than to convey plot-points to the audience), but overall I was a very happy reader.
B0000000LI|1.0|I was given this album by a friend for my birthday, I DID try listening to it (to give my above friend a chance, who adores Yanni) I found it to be laughably awful (or awfully laughable) I have to give Yanni credit though.....for laughing all the way to the bank!! All the songs have a &quot;sameness&quot; about them, not a whit of individuality anywhere, seems to cash in on the current trend for new age pretentious drivel.
076790592X|3.0|Good because it made a hard heart like me cry.  However I can see people feeling enlightened and then forgetting about it.  THat's what makes me sad.  Yet powerful enough to make me cry, perhaps I'm wrong about the previous comment.  It's a wonderful message, &quot;in order to live you must learn how to die&quot;.  Couldn't read it like a novel because me conscious was on me making me guilty.  That's why I gave it 3 *'s, more out of duty for there wasn't an exquisite quality.

B00007EBAG|5.0|It's all come together on this record.   Without question an artistic benchmark for Sananda.  Simply excellent songwriting that is heartfelt, diverse, and much else besides.  One can definitely tell that years of introspection, life, love, and release have gone into this art...and that this time he means it.<br />The &quot;Hardline&quot; years almost seem like another lifetime ago, as well as the famous boast that it was the &quot;best new record since Sgt. Pepper.&quot;  Ahh, the confidence of youth.  But in my mind, he's finally gotten there with this record.  Yes, it's that good.  <br />On a personal note, I saw Sananda in Austin at the (now gone) Liberty Lunch back in 1995, during the Vibrator tour, where for some reason the people let my friend and I in for free because they thought we were part of the band!  (Welcome to Austin! they said!)....ahhh please forgive the reminiscance....<br />I'm delighted and excited with this record, and with Sananda's excellent and open website as well.  Pay it a visit!  [...]<br />The twenty first century has gotten off to an excellent start, that's for sure.
B000099T2L|5.0|Well as we all know this was Beyonce's first solo album and man was it great! Her first hit from the CD (crazy in love) was a infections, awesome song that made you want to get up and dance every time you heard it! After that her next smash was Baby Boy, a sexy, urban, dance song that was a pleasure to hear. Then the slow, but sexy Me, Myself, and I was out and made every person who heard it feel like singing.  Now shes got her sexy, sensual, TRL retired hit, naughty girl, which in my opinion is the best song on the CD! With this CD Beyonce proves that she truly is amazing<BR>1-Crazy In Love (9/10): awesome song but the rap brings it down a piont<BR>2-Naughty Girl (10/10): Insane! how can anyone have so much talent and use all of it in one song!

Every word from her mouth is amazing<BR>5-Be With You (10/10): Best ballad of all time! if you are a sucker for a killer slow song that you can have in your head all day...this is it! man this girl can sing!<BR>6-Me, Myself, and I (10/10): A feel-good-about-yourself for all the ladies goin through a break up. Awesome song<BR>7-Yes (10/10): A great song! addicting and singable<BR>8-Signs (9/10): The song has a great beat but is inturupted by the totally random, totally annoying yelling of \\"REWIND!\\" by missy elliot...maybe she should stay in her own songs and leave the signing to the pros<BR>9-Speechless (10/10): At first it seems like it drahs on forever...but then after a few times of listening to it you will love it! great song<BR>10-Thats How You Like It (10/10): Suprsingly the rap in this song doesnt sound bad and makes the song sounds very nice! one of the few songs that can pull off a rap/pop duet<BR>11-The Closer I Get To You 9/10: A littleslow but deffitnly a great song.

0385510438|3.0|The first thing that you need to know about this book is that it is not a thriller.  The jacket blurb, about a murderer released from prison after threatening to kill the jurors who convicted him, isn't inaccurate as much as it is misleading.  For the most part this is a slow-moving book about ten years in the life of a young man who finds himself living in a small Southern town.  The murder and trial is almost nothing more than background color, and the jurors don't start dying until 60 pages from the end of the book.  <br />In the middle is Grisham's description of small town life, filled with colorful, even bizarre characters, some of which are carryovers from Grisham's first book, A Time To Kill.  For example, the book opens with a gun-toting midget serving legal papers on a newspaper editor named Spot, whose sole passion in life is writing obituaries.  <br />But colorful characters and detailed setting do not a great novel make;  this one unfortunately has no point and very little plot.  But I will admit that I liked the midget better than the albino monk hit man in a certain other bestseller this year . . .
0141301155|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is brilliant.  Roald Dahl's language is eccentric and refreshing.  This book is about a boy named Charlie Bucket who lives with his poor family right near a the greatest chocolate factory in the world.  When the owner of the chocolate factory, Willy Wonka, sends out five golden tickets, the whole world erupts in chaos.  No one has been allowed in the great factory for years, and everyone knows that Wonka is a magician with magic.  The story will make anyone hungry for a good candy bar and is easily amusing.  I would recomment that everyone read this book at least once, though it was directed towards kids in grades 2-6.

0312995423|1.0|I always try to give an author more than one chance. After wasting a few hours of my life on &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; hours I'll never get back, I had almost decided not to bother. As usual, first instincts are best followed.<br />For some reason, Brown seems to think that reciting facts about his characters constitutes character development. As a result, all of his characters are one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs. The reader will be unable to identify with any of the characters and at the end of the story we don't really care what happens to them. The dialog is at best stilted, at worst insipid. Add a weak plot (I had it figured out by the end of the third chapter or so) and a contrived ending and you come up with another complete waste of time.<br />Further complicating matters is Brown's psuedo-factual style. As in &quot;Da Vinci,&quot; he cites events that did not happen and conditions that did not exist as factual. His attempts to elevate populist mythology to the level of actuality fail miserably. He can't seem to decide whether he is going to write purely escapist fiction grounded in a factual if somewhat far-fetched base (e.g. Ian Fleming) or whether he is going to write explorations of what-if scenarios based on real-world situations (e.g. John LeCarre or Tom Clancy). The result is a muddy hodge-podge that defies even the most dedicated attempts at suspension of disbelief. You don't have to be a supercomputer or cryptography nerd to realize that Brown's suppositions on NSA and their attempts at uber-machines for code-breaking are pure bunk. For those with some familiarity in the field, the story and its fallacies are merely annoying.<br />I will now be able to safely skip whatever else Dan Brown and his publisher decide to subject upon us.
038073186X|3.0|Can Lehane ever top &quot;Mystic River&quot;, one of the top twenty books so far this century? Maybe, but not with &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, where Lehane goes from great to good for lack of an editor.<br />The storyline and narrative of this book are flawless; so are the characterization and dialogue. In fact, the plot is mind-blowing -- even after finishing this book, it will be hard to get it out of your head.<br />However, this book has a rushed, half-done feel to it, like it was a first draft and got rushed to publication without a good editing. There are some oddball similes and metaphors in it that an editor would have attacked with a red pen. Also, the reader is not fully informed about the hurricane being on its way; so when it does arrive, you could find yourself flipping back a few pages and scratching your head -- &quot;Huh? There's a hurricane all of a sudden?&quot; Also, the end of the book, when the orderlies unroll the white cloth, is confusing. What's in the white cloth? I don't get it. It did spook me out, though; so it was at least partially effective.<br />All of these issues would have, and should have, frankly, been fixed by a decent editing job, but I don't think this book was given the pleasure.<br />I don't think Lehane is alone. Actually, I think this lack of editing is some sort of current trend in book publishing, maybe having to do with the downsizing at big publishing houses.<br />Anyway --  this book is recommended, especially if you are a Lehane fan. It's a good, decent read.
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|Mystic River opens with a few scenes with three 11 year-olds getting in trouble because of defacing public property. Some, not all, of the boys are taken into the car of a stranger that they are made to believe is a police officer. At that point of the movie, I thought it would be like 1996's Sleepers, directed by Barry Levinson. Instead, the boys grow apart. They are reunited with each other years later under bad circumstances after the 19 year-old daughter of one of them (Sean Penn) is murdered. Throughtout the course of the film, you get the sense that the three childhood friends were just that, childhood friends, not friends as adults, or at least not as closely. The average viewer probably jumps to the same conclusion, and, thankfully, there is a pretty big twist in the last half hour or so.<BR>Clint Eastwood really needs to retire. That movie Blood Work really sucked. He's getting old. This movie isn't without its moments, but it is altogether unsatisfying. I will say that Sean Penn was cast perfectly.
1559409010|5.0|Irreverent, brilliant, ingenius... I'm getting all these words out of the way now before I forget them! Even though I'll probably use them a dozen times!<br />The funniest thing to come from England since The Stamp Act, Monty Python's Flying Circus could always be depended upon to provide the world with brilliantly twisted humor. The LIFE OF BRIAN is no less a comic masterpiece than anything else these boys have done. Ostensibly a parody of the life of Jesus, LIFE OF BRIAN is a hilarious attack on liberalism, conservatism, colonialism, individualism, communalism, organized religion, disorganized religion, fanaticism, feminism... take your pick of any of a hundred topics. It doesn't matter, it's still brilliant. And the script and direction holds it perfectly all together, even if there's a space ship chase sequence thrown in for the hell of it. <br />Once again, the members of MPFC each play several roles and every viewer has his or her favorites, so what the hell, I'll mention mine. Michael Palin, while playing a wonderfully foppy Pontius Pilate, is equally hilarious as a twitchy, hyperactive leper that Jesus had cured. Instead of being grateful, he complains that his rehabilitation has ruined his livelihood as a beggar. (Speaking of rehabilitation, Palin plays the part like a junkie in need of a fix.) John Cleese has several great moments, but his role as a Centurion turned sadistic Latin teacher is nothing short of genius. Everyone who has studied Latin will be beside themselves during this scene. And Terry Jones as Brian's mom still stuns me 25 years later. &quot;My Brian is not the messiah! He's a very naughty, naughty boy.&quot;<br />Monty Python's LIFE OF BRIAN is irreverent, brilliant, and ingenius and this edition, complete with outtakes, behind-the-scenes footage, and interviews make this package worth the price. Whether you are an individual or not, &quot;Monty Python's Life of Brian - Criterion Collection&quot; will save your comic soul.
0345423496|4.0|For me, the compelling story of Franke Pool, long believed to be dead, being resurrected and communicating with the evolved consciousness of Dave Bowman within the monolith was just too good to pass up. I've added it to: Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others.
B000001FKY|2.0|Producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange is really a rich man, because he can turn things into gold. He got the Midas Touch. This guy produced BACK IN BLACK for AC/DC, then COME ON OVER (by his wife Shania Twain), two of the best selling albums of all times, and also PYROMANIA and HYSTERIA, the best selling albums by Def Leppard. So, it´s clear that this guy knows his business.<br />The trouble with Hysteria is that, in my opinion, the catchy songs featured here would still sell millions of copies if they were recorded with heart, not with total commercialism. As it was, this is a robotic album, devoid of any feelings in the approach to the songs, not the songs themselves. Ok, we must acknowledge the fact that the band kept drummer Rick Allen after he lost his arm, demonstrating they are supportive and generous men.<br />After Hysteria, Def Leppard went into the &quot;love songs&quot; market, and never looked back...
B00005JMEW|5.0|The Japanese version of this DVD, available at amazon's Japanese site, offers Japanese and english soundtrack. The famous black/white fighting scene at the house of blue leaves in the Japanese version is all coloured. This however is not the only difference: The movie altogether is longer and more brutal, especially the aforementioned fighting scene and the animated part on O-Ren's childhood has been enhanced. I guess it is worth investing the additional shipping cost to enjoy this.
B0000025YL|5.0|This CD is simply breathtaking. It embodies the best of 80´s heavy metal, played with high skill by this German boys, who were reching the peask of their game.<br />RESTLESS AND WILD is one of the best metal offerings of 1982, along with SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE (Judas Priest) and THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST (Iron Maiden). It has aged very well, and it was very well produced by Michael Wagener, a master of his craft.<br />The ten songs are very good, not a filler here.
0743424425|5.0|(...) This book obviously goes beyond their limited understanding. They all complain because they want action, they want blood, they want gruesome violence. Character development? Waste of space. Details? \\"He walked in the room. The ghost killed him.\\" would do just fine. The Shining is way more than a ghost story. Just read it. I guarantee you'll want more of King. Then you'll be hooked. I can't put into words how awesome this book is. I couldn't stop reading for the life of me. This book is definately going to be among the few books on my shelf read multiple times.<br />What are you waiting for? Click \\"add to cart\\" NOW!
B00005NNMJ|4.0|After the majestic RESTLESS AND WILD, theoretically Accept had only one way to go: down.<br />But, surprise! They managed to record another masterpiece metal album, BALLS TO THE WALL. The ballad WInterdreams is hypnotizing, mesmerizing. &quot;Love Child&quot; is highly energetic and with an amazing pace. The title track is a good epic. Once again, the ten songs are from good to absolutely great, no filler. It´s clear that Udo´s voice was always a important factor to the band popularity: some people simply hate his voice, some people love it, and others hate it but consider it to fit the band´s sound. I particularly believe, even enjoying Accept in any way, that the band would have benfited more if they had a less &quot;screaming&quot; singer...
B00005OAIE|4.0|This debut by John is a sheer knockout, enjoyable by both twentysomething females looking for love (good, real, sincere love) and twentysomething males that similarly emulate John's awkwardness in finding such love. While love is not big on my agenda currently, John has a very sincere way of conveying relationship situations... obviously credited to his superb lyricism. Track 3 &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; for instance, vividly captures the discomfort of a &quot;slip of the mouth&quot; on an already tense, figgedity first date. John not only delivers situational dialogue, but also paints a fabulous description of body mannerisms, nervous behavior, and emotion. You can't help but say &quot;Damn, I've been through a situation just like that!&quot; Not all his songs are about relationships though, tracks like &quot;'83&quot; and &quot;3x5&quot; show the true observer in John, respectively discussing the simplicity of childhood and how memories are so much bigger than any camera or 3x5 could ever capture.
B00000DGUG|4.0|Though in my opinion not as good as Jagged Little Pill or Under Rug Swept, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is a spiritual journey through the thoughts and mind of Alanis.  Always writing straight from her heart, this album was recorded/written during/after her trip to India where Alanis fled to get away from it all.  Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is a collection of 17 songs featuring the famous single Thank You, a song tribute to India for helping her.  Though lacking in musical style, the song writing makes up for most of it.  This album is more poetry than music, in my opinion.  The lyrics should tell you that.  Still a great listen and a perfect addiction to any music or Alanis collection.  Best tracks - The Couch, Would Not Come, Joining You, One, Can't Not, I Was Hoping
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Sticking with the soul circuit, one album I have kept in my CD player for months has been Miss Alicia Keys' second effort &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys.&quot; What a wonderfully done album and a superb example of how to grow from one album to the next. Miss Keys flows as beautifully as her name. All facets of this talent has blossomed tremendously from her debut, which was a masterpiece in its own right. What really gets me with Alicia Keys is her inevitable ability to blend classic piano training with crazy hot hip-hop beats that somehow results in a great sonic balance that appeals to all. Even her dabble with old soul classics are brillantly revived in a way that is respectful of the original, but has crazy modern appeal. Only true talent can exude such excellence in its craft. As track #3 says, &quot;Go 'head girl&quot;. <br />Recommendation: A must-get if you love R&amp;B soul music. A definite if you want to relive Alicia's brillance from her first album.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Wow I'm having trouble reviewing this just because Roger Ebert said everything already. This movie is superb and a true work of art. Without a doubt the best in the man with no name series and quite possibly the best western of all time. With outstanding performances by not only Lee Van Cleef and my personal favorite Clint Eastwood, but also an amazing performance by Eli Wallach as Tuco. The additional footage only makes this movie better by better  explaining the story and by making the joy you get from watching this movie last 18 minutes longer. This is without a doubt the finest hour for Sergio Leone, who made many other classics including the first two in the &quot;dollar trilogy&quot;. <BR>        Another great thing about this DVD is everything you get with it. I love the little movie posters you get and the booklet with a wonderful review written by Roger Ebert. And then we come to the special features disc. They include some great documentary's on Sergio Leone and others and about 4 or 5 easter eggs. Overall a fantastic edition of one of the best movies of all time at a wonderfull price. Also, if you have the money I recommend picking up the other two movies in this trilogy(A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More) and watching them in order but if you don't have enough money this DVD is PLENTY!!!
0780020693|5.0|this is a great cast of characters that intertwine with one another to tell the story of boys growing up.  great anti-facist satire, and visual comedy.  perhaps the best coming-of-age film ever, amarcord gets a standing ovation at precisely the 100:00 minute mark (check it yourself) as every young mans dream comes true, in this case, 100 times over.<br />fantastic transfer that shames my old VHS copy.  check it out
B000002W9Q|3.0|I was disappointed with this CD.  It lacks some of the important music from the movie; and yet, it is listed as a sound track from the movie.  I don't think so!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|avril is the coolest<br />all of her songs has meaning in it and i really like that<br />bascially all her songs are really good<br />but here are a few really good ones<br />&quot;together&quot; &quot;don't tell me&quot; &quot;my happy ending&quot;&quot;forgotten&quot; &quot;slipped away&quot;!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXCT|2.0|This children's movie is slightly easier for a parent to endure than a lot of disney movies.  It boggles the mind how many people over the age of twelve are devoted to it. Probably the same people who still collect children's toys and spend their breakfasts trying to solve the maze on the back of a box of Captain Crunch.
6305508550|5.0|I save the descriptions of the movie for others. I just wanted to say that this is one of the funniest movies ever. and i wanted to ask does anyone know if there is going to be a dvd coming out anytime with more extras.
0679600019|5.0|Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|Eternal Sunshine is a visually dazzling and emotionally challenging film. I would deem it impossible to walk away from watching it without believing that every experience in life, good or bad, every relationship,pitfall job etc we have shapes who we are and being grateful for each.<BR>This movie is one of a kind which is so rare nowadays. It is comparable to Big Fish in what it asks from the viewer, and what it offers. It is simply beautiful. Carrey and Winslet have outdone themselves.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, with current television programming of reality tv shows, oversexed and slick idiot characters, and no depth of story or character development, shows like Firefly are a relief.  Joss Whedon's vision of the blend of new and old in an amazingly detailed future is both intriguing and entertaining.<BR>It was a stupid move on the part of Fox network to cancel the show after only airing eleven shows and making it almost impossible for the audience to even find the show.  It is quite unfortunate that the series never answered some of the big questions raised and developed in the plots of the first shows.  This collection is worth anyone's time who wishes to see a show that treats its audience intelligently with humor and drama,  plots that are both fun and interesting, appealing to the smartass within.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Each song of this album, shows that Christina Aguilera's voice is so wonderful!
B00005JLEX|5.0|I watch reruns everyday and taped them a long time ago, but I REALLY NEED THE DVD's, this show is the best ever, I always laugh of the same jokes, I never get enough of it...<br />I don't what the big deal is with the releasing of the DVD, but I hope they agree soon and let the fans have what we want!<br />I heard that maybe they would release it on December, It would be a great Christmas gift, don't you think??
B00005QFE5|4.0|Zhang Ziyi's performance in &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; had me wondering, out of all the stellar cast involved, who this was who had me the most impressed. I researched her filmography and came across &quot;THE ROAD HOME&quot;. Mind you, I'm mostly a fight-it-out, special-effects, action movie fan who had my reservations about getting it once I finally found someplace to buy it. I rented first and I had no regrets afterwards.<br /> Great films done properly can tell a simple story and hold the attention of the audience if one chooses to do so. This is a great example. Scenic vistas, compelling acting and a moving story has made this a favorite of my movie collection. Without saying too much (as the previous reviews have already done so), I will recommend at least everyone rent this. It doesn't have a huge budget, no CGI, no gun-toting and no foul language. What does that leave? A movie like they used to make 'em.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie was the greatest movie ever! I've watched it over and over, and It's just fantastic! Perfect family movie, satisfies every age catagory! Sen's brave appeal yet squeakish youngter apperance is astounding! You've got to see this movie! It will touch your heart!
B00005JMKI|5.0|Pretty long movie, but once the ending hits you forget all that.<BR>I saw nothing anti-american about this movie.  The great thing about it is you can take it and rename and relocate the small town, and the story would still fit.  It's about human behavior.<BR>I was surprised and enjoyed it.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|A mi parecer, este disco solo nos reafirma la calidad de musicos q componen este &quot;circulo perfecto&quot;.<BR>Demas esta mencionar a James Iha, y al ex hombre de Manson, q por cierto demuestra su calidad de musico en esta placa, sin menos preciar a Paz, pero este disco esta mucho mejor, nos hace olvidar por completo de Tool, con todos sus matices de ira - paz, es cierto q este &quot;proyecto&quot; estaba pensado para q una mujer tomara el microfono, pero... gracias a dios q no fue asi....
B00005OAIE|1.0|Why would anybody like this guy?  He's so amazingly bad!  He slurs his words, has horrible lyrics, and makes me physically ill.  Sure, he might be skilled at playing the guitar, but does that matter when he has the most irritating voice and lyrics ever?  It makes me so angry to see his video, with him making out with a hot chick.  I should be doing that!  Man, how do people get to like this guy?  I give up!
0066620996|5.0|I have read several books on management and business including another book by Jim Collins, &quot;Built to Last&quot;. This has to be one of the greatest ones ever written. I would put it on the same level as one of Peter F. Drucker's books.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is NO DOUBT's best album. Finally they dove into doing real reggae instead of SKA. I rock this album everyday since I got it!
B00006L7XQ|4.0|His voice is weathered but the overall effect is quite good. The cover of the Trent Reznor song, &quot;Hurt,&quot; is surprising in its complexity and beauty.  I would never have expected Johnny to sing that song so hauntingly which is in keeping with the theme of the free video DVD which is attached.  &quot;Danny Boy&quot; is strong but the title track is superlative.  His short interpretation of the biblical passage of the white rider bringing death is fantastic.  I was not prepared for the way in which in this CD grew on me.
B000066NW0|4.0|I usually don't listen to pop music, but Avril caught my attention mainly because her music has more of an edge to it and because well... it was pretty unavoidable seeing that my little sister listens to her 24/7, so ya know... Well this album is better than all your Britney's and stuff like that mainly because theirs some musicianship. Avril herself doesn't do most of the guitar work, its her backup band, but still, the music does make the CD more satisfying, even if it doesn't play a huge part in the songs (no solos or driving riffs, basically just chords, but its all good). I look at Avril, FeFe Dobson, Busted and McFly (those last 2 are British pop bands who also are sort of marketed as &quot;punk&quot; but dont live up to their image) as a new genre called &quot;alternative pop&quot;. I really think its stupid for people to hate Avril just because she doesn't live up to an &quot;image&quot; or w/e, who really cares, it should be the music that counts. Record labels will do anything to make an artist sell, and jumping on a trend is a great way to do that- so I really cant blame Avril for that at all. So if you like pop music but a little bit of a rock edge (her music is kind of like 1 step down from Blink-182 and Good Charlotte, stuff like that), buy this immediately.
0394800184|5.0|This was one of my absolute favorite books as a child. Twenty seven years later I read it to my one year old, and when I picked it up for the first time to read it to him I still had all of the words memorized from that long ago. He has shelves and shelves of books, but every night this one has to be read or he won't go to sleep! A classic book that will be around for more years. What better story to read to your children than about a baby's and mother's love for each other.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is the wonderful movie. It really does the story justice. I love all of the music. The costumes. Everything was just great.<BR>Peter Pan is one of the most beloved children stories in the whole world.<BR>This movie proves the power of it's beauty with the story.<BR> You will love it if you want to see a true Peter Pan story.
B0000029LG|5.0|HIStory is one of the best albums of Michael Jackson.<BR>I don't talk about the first CD but the second.<BR>The songs Scream, They don't care about us, Earth song, Stranger in moscow , Money, Tabloid Junkie are AMAZING. The album is very interesting; Michael shares his secrets,his pains, his fears, opens his heart . The songs are far from the too smooth  songs of Thriller and off the wall - these two albums are soooo overrated! - If you understand Michael Jackson's genius, you cannot bash HIStory...
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a beautiful movie. It's about nature and trust. Beliefs and trying to belong.<BR>I really love it. It's a shame that the movie didn't do better in theaters.<BR>However, it has now been able to find it's own audience.<BR> Really beautiful story about two different people.<BR>It's magical and tragic in ways.
630018403X|5.0|I myself can identify most with molly ringwalds character claire.she is viewed by the others as having the perfect life,but she has her own problems.just because her family is wealthy,and is friends with the 'in' crowd doesn't make her life any easier.the others in the movie (in the beginning)only see her as a princess, but by the end they see her and her problems.this movie really teaches that no matter how you appear on the outside you can be a whole different person on the inside.
B00006IR5S|2.0|I didn't think that this was all this great. The songs sound the same after a while. The sound too similar to the first and there movie.<BR>I do like it though. The music is nice and creative. But only to a point.<BR>I would personally just stick with the first sound track.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|I sometimes manage to be among the last individuals on earth to see a blockbuster movie, and such is the case with Shrek.  Having finally seen the film, however, I will certainly echo the high praises it has received from those who have come before me.  Shrek is visually stunning, continuously hilarious, and uplifting in its message.  It's fun for the entire family, appealing to adults and children in equal measure, and it just makes you feel good after the credits roll.  The DVD throws in tons of extras, giving you more Shrek bang for the bucks.<br />The look of this film is amazing; animation has definitely entered the twenty-first century, and the guys and gals at Dreamworks are forging the way ever onward and upward.  You really have to see the animation in Shrek to appreciate it - I can tell you that it is in stunning 3-D detail, that each character has more incredibly realistic and subtle facial expressions than I do, that you could sometimes swear (especially when watching Princess Fiona) that you are watching real people on the screen, and that Shrek transports you to a world unlike any you have seen before, but that barely begins to describe the animation magic at play here.  The real proof of the pudding is in the details, and you will be amazed at all the subtle nuances you pick up each time you watch the film: you can see the wind in the grass, leaves blowing, dust rising, clothes wrinkling and moving naturally in relation to each character's body movements, hair stirring characters' hair (except for Shrek, of course, who is quite bald - not to mention green and altogether ogrely), etc..  The attention to detail is simply amazing, and I can't help but wonder why this film didn't cost about fifty billion dollars to make based on what I saw.<br />Of course, the incredible animation would all go for naught without great actors supplying the voices of the characters, and you would have to look long and hard to beat the cast of Shrek.  Start with the two funniest men in Hollywood, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, as Shrek the lovable ogre and his sidekick Donkey; then throw in Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and John Lithgow as the bad guy.  Myers and Murphy will keep you in stitches from start to finish.  I won't go into the whole plot of the story here, as I'm sure that information is pretty easy to find hereabouts, but I will say the story is incredibly witty and is truly the stuff that all-time classic films are made of.  While it turns the world of fairy tales on its ear, it does come bearing some important morals, the most important of which is the advice to not judge a person by his/her appearance.  Shrek is much more than a disgusting, disagreeable ogre, and Fiona turns out to be the least typical princess you could ever hope to meet.<br />The extras on the DVD give you a good idea of the creative process that went into bringing Shrek to life: storyboards of deleted scenes, an HBO special on the making of the movie, technical goofs, and an informative commentary by the filmmakers.  In terms of pure entertainment, you also get the complete extended dance party ending of the film, the means to jump directly to many of the funnier or more visually stunning scenes, music videos from Smashmouth and Baha Men, and a number of silly little games to play.  Consider all of these extras as icing on the proverbial cake, however, as the movie alone packs more entertainment than almost any other DVD you will ever find.iest men in Hollywood, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, as Shrek the lovable ogre and his sidekick Donkey; then throw in Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and John Lithgow as the bad guy.

B000066F6H|4.0|Don't believe all of the hype surrounding the Hives. They're good, yes, but they're not anything brand new. The Hives merely put out a sound that had not been heard in the mainstream scene, and for this I am thankful. At a mere 28 minutes, Veni Vidi Vicious is extremely refreshing. Loud, if not grating at times, but it's nice to listen to something slightly different. Granted, there are hundreds of bands thrown into the &quot;garage rock&quot; label at this point, but the Hives possess a certain sound that makes them stand out. Perhaps it's Pelle Almqvist's shriek. Or the speed of the songs. The rapidness of each track off of Veni Vidi Vicious makes you wonder what you just listened to. I remember buying this for about 17 dollars when I was 13 and thinking I was completely ripped off when I found out it was under 30 minutes long. I soon realized that 28 minutes or not, it was worth the cash.<BR>It's not worth all of the praise, but it's definitely worth the purchase.
B00005A46T|5.0|... because I always thought this band was a bunch of clowns with stupid masks that couldn't play an instrument properly and hid their inability behind heavy distortion and stupid rap-metal lyrics. In short I thought they were nu-metal. They may be categorised so but still I was really surprised to discover that Slipknot is by far in a higher level than s**t like Limping Park or Biscuit or whatever and also the most overestimated band of history; Korn as well. First of all Iowa is really heavy, at times you can even think of it as death metal (it's not I know but it gets as heavy at times). The band members are not virtuosos but as a band they have written and played some very good songs. Like many other reviewers here I can't get the point of having 9 members as well. They just sound like a 5-piece band. The drummer is excellent, he could even play for Cradle of Filth or Testament. The vocals are also pretty good to be called &quot;nu&quot;. <br />If you have ignored this band on prejudice like me, don't and listen to Iowa immediately. They are heavy, pissed off, loud and have some sensible lyrics. They should be mentioned together with Hatebreed, Godforbid, Damageplan and bands like that not Linkin limping whatever.
B000089RVX|3.0|this thing is'nt the best i've ever herd i mean i like the songs and stuff but there's not enough rockish theme to it.(...)
B0001KU8ZG|5.0|I first saw this in the theater without knowing anything about the movie.  I was enthralled from the first minutes and cried through the last.  I have since seen it again and have told many people to see it.  Since we are all children with fathers, this film should touch all of us in different ways.  I highly recommend this film.
B0000C8AV2|5.0|I avoided this Dylan album for a long time--but eventually, when you own more than 30 Dylan albums, you end up with Oh Mercy. What a fool I was to wait! Buried in the long downswing of his catalog we find one of Dylan's tightest and most enjoyable albums. (Apparently I'm not the only one rediscovering the album; songs from it were featured in Wonder Boys and High Fidelity.)<br />The SACD version, though, is a revelation: with Dylan's voice lifted ever-so-slightly in the mix, we can hear how well he enunciates the clever lyrics of this album and how Daniel Lanois builds a beautiful bed for those lyrics with his crisp and classy production work. Even the regular CD layer of this hybrid offers a phenomenal improvement in clarity. If you loved the album before this, your experience will be like discovering that you've been listening to the songs through a door; now that door has been opened and you're right there with Bob and the band in all their glory. Highlights include :Most of the Time,&quot; &quot;Shooting Star,&quot; and &quot;Ring Them Bells,&quot; but this is one of the most consistent and listenable Dylan albums in his catalog.
B00008NG5V|5.0|this is the ultimate cd to bring with you when you go to the beach or are just looking for something good to listen to. i love it when i can get a cd and not skip a track on it, and love evry minute of it! buy it now!
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|I don't understand why critics around the world joined hands in universal praise for this film. I see an enormous amount of films and I usually tend to agree with the majority of critical opinions, but not this time.<br />Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are both HORRIBLE in this movie. I'm no actor, but to see Sean Penn in &quot;anguish&quot; over his daughter is the most unintentionally funny performance of the year. It looks like he decided to try as hard as he could to be &quot;dramatic&quot; and all his lines are spoken with an annoying scowl. Tim Robbins is worse, wandering around looking confused and failing to show us any character beyond Tim Robbins: Actor.<br />Don't even get me started about the ending, lame. I saw it coming an hour away. I love Eastwood, but people are pandering to him too much. I've watched better episodes of network TV drama.<br />Overlit Hollywood crap.
B00000J7JO|1.0|I know it isn't very trendy to say so, but I consider the Chilis one of the more important 80s and early 90s bands--Blood Sugar Sex Magic was 60+ minutes of sustained brilliance. Californication is an obvious attempt to recapture that. Rick Rubin and John Frusciante are back, the sound of the band is somewhat similar, everyone can still play, but somehow, it all sounds forced. How can you measure inspiration? I don't know, but the songs just aren't there for me. It's sad--I really wanted to like this record, just like I really wanted to like One Hot Minute. I'll check out By the Way, but I've stopped expecting much.... Still, these guys have paid their dues--if they want to put out mediocre albums for the next ten years and rake in the bucks, more power to them.
B0002DB50E|5.0|Max Renn (James Woods) is the CEO of a sleazy little cable channel that is eking out its niche in the market by offering violence and soft-core pornography.  Always on the lookout for something tougher, he becomes excited by the pirate broadcasts of a program called Videodrome, 30 minutes of torture with no pretense to any plot.  He decides to track down the makers of the show, little realizing that he is already in way over his head...    David Cronenberg is a consistently interesting filmmaker and his major themes are on display here--the question of identity and the ways, both physical and psychological, that man is transformed by his technology.  \\"Videodrome\\" is prescient in the way it forecasted the ever-increasing levels of depravity and sensation that has become available in the media.  The film becomes increasingly surreal and phantasmagoric as the story progresses, but stick with it and think about it afterward.  All the pieces fit together./
B00007GZR5|5.0|The dreams that came to me while watching the newfound romance in hell movie What Dreams May Come came to me as a sort of shock.  Being of only fourteen years of age now I was only around ten when I first saw this movie on an early afternoon matinee on a local television station while I was left at home alone. My sister being thirteen had a life of her own with her friends and my mother and father  were either at work or shopping for supplies for their work. What Dreams May Come gave me a basis of an idea for an afterlife since my parents don't agree on a church to go to, and I hadn't gone since my first communion-me being a catholic from my mother's side of the family. After my mother got  home that day I told her about the movie and at first she was a little concerned- it as though she wasn't sure if I should've been exposed to a movie with that kind of content since I was &quot;only a little girl&quot; to put it in her words. Later that night she pulled me out of bed and we had the first real discussion that we had ever had on the subject of death, christ, heaven, hell, and purgatory. It wasn't two weeks later that we rented the movie and had the whole family (with the exception of my Dad for twenty minutes) sit down and watch it together. This is more of a thank you than a review, but thank you.
B000000OAH|5.0|This CD was Queen's last 70's studio offering.And what a package it is!Freddie's vocals and Brian's guitar playing at the forefront steer you through the many and diverse tracks while theirs and John's and Roger's creativity cap it royally and gracefully.If you like rockers there's DEAD ON TIME and FAT BOTTOMED GIRLS,if you like pop there's BYCICLE RACE.JEALOUSY and IN ONLY SEVEN DAYS are two of their greatest ballads showcasing Freddie's incredibly gifted pipes.To top it all off,they adventure into a blues-oriented DREAMERS BALL where you can picture Freddie moving and singing like Josephine Baker would.A Great album overall!
B000268QB2|3.0|Just because these guys are Britpop, doesn't mean that they should automatically be compared to greats like CP and RH. <br />I bought this CD based on <BR>a) the price caught my attention as i am always looking for cool new bands for a cheap price<BR>b) the sticker on the wrapper said the word that I always associate with cool music &quot;anthemic&quot;. <br />I was disappointed with this CD from the getgo. I was expecting something great. What I got was something to keep on the shelf to gather dust. The CD is good for about the first listen, but then you can just put it back. I love Coldplay and Radiohead but let me tell you Keane is nothing like them. They're closer to a modern Beatles, than anything. If you want a good cheap CD to listen to over and over again buy something like Radiohead's &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; or something. That is a good album! <BR>But don't take my word for it, its not a bad album. It warrants the 3 stars I gave it. A more accurate grade would be a:<br />7/10 or a B-
B000089CJI|4.0|This is album is new and different. You really have to like what they are doing to be down with it. I suggest sampelling the files. Also, Even though I really like it, it gets old very quickly (4 stars)
B00005JLXE|4.0|afleck. what can i say about afleck. i never liked him in any other movie. i didn't like him a lot! i think putting him in ths movie earned it quite a few bad reviews it didn't deserve. part of the problem is that he seems like the guy with all the women and other guys don't like that guy. i've tried to look past that. why? because...this isn't easy to say... he was good in daredevil. i kinda dug him just a little in this role and only this role. the movie is a great time and yeah afleck is better here than in anything else.
0312263120|3.0|... and I've read worse. I found this an interesting book with things that I liked and things I didn't. <br />I liked the pace, it was really difficult to stop reading! Alternating the action between two or three places with short chapters helped a lot. <br />I didn't like the fact that Mr. Brown didn't check some of his facts. For example, at some point he calls the German Enigma machine &quot;a 2 ton monster&quot; when in fact these machines were quite portable and ressembled a typewriter.<br />I won't go into the technical details, I think they annoyed me because I'm a software engineer.<br />Anyway, interesting and entertaining to read. Let's see how does The DaVinci Code go...
B000148KK2|1.0|I have EVERY single Diana Krall CD. I had such an expectation from her. Through the years, I've noticed her decline in her jazz roots. I can't believe what kind of stunts she was pulling on this CD. How horrific! I liked ONE song...and even that one song (&quot;Love Me Like a Man&quot;) doesn't compare to the standards she is so good at signing and reinterpreting. <br />Don't buy this CD unless you want horrible songwriting or you want to set a depressing mood in your home with the song selections. <br />DIANA, GO BACK TO JAZZ...forget this songwriting business.
B000000OAN|5.0|This is Queen's best career album.It is excellent from DEATH ON TWO LEGS all the way through GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.It is a must for any rock music fan collection.My favorites are the ballad LOVE OF MY LIFE(that should've been an American single),YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND(which was),'39 and the epic masterpiece BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY.Another wonderful gem is the PROPHET's SONG which features some of the most amazing lyrics and enchanting vocals I've ever heard on a record.An A plus for the boys!
B000000WA4|5.0|Ok, so I am not pretending to have listened to them since they first started out in whomever's garage, and so on like so many &quot;fans&quot; I have talked to.  I am a big Smashing Pumpkins fan, and that is through listening to their music as it comes, and on my own terms.  Sorry, but I am not a fan to brag that I knew something before anyone else.  In fact, I was never a huge fan until this cd came out.  Siamese Dream was played minimally, and the others the same.  The more and more I listened to MCIS however, the more I couldn't go in between sessions of listening.  This caused me to go back, and reevaluate my previous thoughts on their other cd's.  That is a sign of greatness, being able to change people's views on accomplishments already made by new great achievments.  These cd's have songs for any kind of mood you could ever be in, and then some.  From Porcelina (my favorite song) to Tonight, Tonight, to 1979, every song on this cd deserves to be listened to over and over again.  I am a fan of music, and based on the thousands of dollars I have spent on hundreds of cd's, I can safely say this is the best investment ever (never been a big fan of burning cd's).  Personally, right below the Pumpkins are Sevendust and Spice 1 (funny how they are all S's), so diversity is not an area where I am lacking I believe.  Take it for what you will, but for someone who loves music, and drags 600 cd's to work with me everyday, I could not live without this pair.  They are essential, beyond any other single cd or set I own.  I know you will think the same when you listen.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Everybody is hurting in this movie.  Sean Penn's character with the death of his daughter; Kevin Bacon's character having to deal with the depature of his wife and child, and all of them, but mostly Tim Robbins' character, trying to deal with the horrible incident of their youth.  While this movie is emotionally deep without spelling it out for us, it doesn't even hold a candle to how amazing the book is.  Easily Clint Eastwoods finest work, and also for the overshadowed and understated Kevin Bacon.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|I watched this movie twice. Once in the theater because my friend had dragged me into it and I had mistook the movie for another. I hadn't really liked it but I thought it was because I was disappointed that the movie wasn't what I had thought it was going to be. The second time I watched to see if I was wrong. Well, I will say again this movie wasn't that good. It was more of a droning movie that had no real plot to it. Despite the intelligence of the teacher, she fell for another teacher who sleeps with the students. . . and she is supposed to be smart? Ms. Watson leeaving the school is where the movie cuts off. But you don't really know if what the male teacher, Dunbar, said was true about how she can never be happy because she reaches too high in a man. I guess taken individually the stories of the students and the teachers in the camp are interesting which was why I was going to give this movie two stars.<br />But it was the great acting that bumped this movie up another star. There were two supreme great acting scenes that will be ingrained in my memory: The first one is where the teacher, Watson, is telling the student who got into Harvard, Joan, that she needs to go there to save the woman race. And of Joan telling her that Watson is the one who told her she could do whatever he wants to do and she wants to be a housewife. The second one is my favorite though. This is when Betty Warren, the witch of the group, tells Giselle, a girl who sleeps around, that if Giselle were paid for how many men she sleeps with, Giselle would be a millionaire. And then when Betty keeps yelling and then breaks down crying in Giselle's arms, that really got to me. <br />Although this movie in itself is not good. The message behind it is great too. Because of these messages I had to go and give the movie another star. Sometimes friends try to hurt you because they are hurting themselves. In the case of Connie, you need to believe in yourself and have self-confidence. In Joan's case, you can do anything if you really want to. Also, though baser, in Katherine's case, don't fall for a guy who is doing the illegal by sleeping with his students. <br />Okay so I guess four stars are pretty good for a so-called bad movie. I hadn't planned on giving it so many stars but this movie kind of earned it. And I guess the movie is an okay movie except for the plot. The beginning is slow and you don't know what is happening. It is more like a story is being unfolded before your eyes because the plot of the movie is not at the outset. It is slow in a couple parts: the beginning and three short times in the middle. Other than that, this movie is very good.
B000148KK2|1.0|I have EVERY single Diana Krall CD and I have never been so disappointed and angry at the same time. It's a rip off. Go back to standards...don't even attempt to do anymore songwriting please! As soon as I popped in this CD - which was excruciating to listen to - I wanted to return it to the store. Oh, this was not the CD to buy. I want my money back. OOOF! Diana, go back to your true jazz roots PLEASE! Your fans aren't happy. I am one of them.
B00004XQP4|4.0|Green Day is a good band but they just like Metallica, eventually slowed things down. Nevertheless this is a good album with some highlights like Blood, Sex and Booze and the incredible beautiful and fantastic Macy's Day Parade. This song is really great, and definetly their best ballad.<BR>NI!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Amazing character portrayal, all-star cast, and powerful storyline make this (controversial though this may seem) my favorite western ever.  A must-see to anyone who enjoys the genre!
B0001ENYKS|3.0|This is a very familiar sound... one that we heard with the strokes, so it's not really all that new.  The lead singer reminds of the guy who sings &quot;Puttin' on the Ritz.&quot;  The songs consist of catchy guitar riffs played repeatedly over great drum beats.  They're hooky tunes with little to say, but it's just good fun.
0385508417|1.0|Unrealistic, materialistic, we-are-all-the-same neighbors (must have plastic snowman on roof! big brother is watching you!), boring plot, peer pressure for the middle-aged ending.  What a waste of perfectly good paper.  There is absolutely nothing in this book to make you glad you read it.  I know I'm sorry I did.
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors are a legendary and my favorite band. This was their first album, some say it was their best. I personally love all of them. I really can't say enough about how amazing The Doors, and this album are. There's nothing better than just sitting around and listening to Jim Morrison wail \\"Back Door Man\\". There is such raw emotion and poetry in his lyrics. So go and get a copy and experience that magic... as corny as that sounds.
B00005JKED|5.0|Back in the &quot;go go&quot; 1980s, during the heady era of Wall Street &quot;greed,&quot; I read an article about a black stock broker indicted by the SEC for insider trading. It struck me that, in an odd way, this was indicative of progress for African-Americans. They had to have access to the inside in order to be indicted for it. In the old days, they never would have had those doors opened in the first place.<br />Which brings me to &quot;Training Day&quot;, in which Denzel Washington delivers an astonishingly good performance as a totally corrupt and evil L.A. cop. The fact that an African-American leading man is portrayed as the &quot;bad guy&quot; is truly groundbreaking, and just another reason to look at this film and be in awe of it. In the same strange twist as the stock broker, here we see a black cop who has all the doors of sin open to him. Like the white cops of the Jim Crow South, he takes to corruption in a way that has no skin color. It is the story of humanity, temptation and power. <br />Blacks on film have for a number of years now been shown either one way or the other. There is no shortage of depictions of black drug dealers, gangbangers and &quot;homies.&quot; Hollywood then tries to make up for it by portraying blacks as doctors, lawyers, voices of conscience or reason, and the most frequent stereotype, the &quot;tough but fair police commander.&quot;<br />The negative portrayals of blacks, however, were never played by big name actors. Washington himself has built a career as a guy more or less saving the world in &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; and &quot;Fallen&quot;. His flaws in &quot;Ricochet&quot; are brought out only by a vindictive white man (John Lithgow). In &quot;Training Day&quot;, Denzel is all on his charismatic own, a product of a world that he is convinced revolves around him. By choosing to pursue this amazing role, Denzel demonstrates the kind of courage that is rare among actors.<br />Think of Robert Redford, for instance. Redford never let his hair down. He played heroes and fantasy figures. Every so often, however, a superstar will break type. Paul Newman did it in &quot;Hud&quot;. So did Robert Duvall in &quot;The Great Santini&quot;.<br />What is even more astonishing in &quot;Training Day&quot; is not just that a black guy is the bad guy, but a white guy (Ethan Hawke) is a clearly marked, unfettered hero, placed in utter contrast and opposition to the villain. &quot;Candy Man&quot;, a B movie franchise of the early 1990s, featured the politically explosive portrayal of a black man slicing and dicing his way through white women, but this was hardly big time fare.<br />&quot;Training Day&quot; takes all the Political Correctness of the past 20 years and explodes it. Hawke not only is innocent and good in contrast with Denzel, but he is a Lancelot-type figure who comes to the aid of a Latino-girl-in-distress, and later faces torture and terror at the hands of a group of Mexican gangbangers. The actors who portray these guys are so good, so real and so terrifying that if you met them on the streets, even knowing they were just acting, you would be a little frightened.<br />By no means does &quot;Training Day&quot; leave the viewer groping with the uncomfortable notion that &quot;white is right.&quot; The performances are too real and too powerful. It is only in retrospect that one realizes this is truly groundbreaking stuff. Denzel Washington is extraordinary. His performance in this film is among the very best ever seen. There are not enough superlatives, not enough words, than can do justice to his edgy power.<br />&quot;Training Day&quot; leaves the thinking viewer utterly exhausted and left in some kind of daze, grateful only that they do not live in the netherworld shown herein. Look at Ethan's face when he rides the bus after escaping, through pure luck and coincidence, death at the hands of the gangbangers. He is beaten. His actions afterwards are about redemption, a decision to take his life in a new direction in which expediency and innocence are no longer options. He has been transformed into a reluctant avenging angel, forced to face evil and fear because he cannot turn back. It is the story of Original Sin. Ethan represents what the viewer does not have the gumption to be at this point. The viewer wants only to crawl in a hole and forget what (s)he has seen, but Ethan's character is about the confrontation of good vs. evil that must take place if humanity hopes to advance.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>...
B00004CWO8|2.0|I don't mind the homoeroticism, I don't mind the updating and reinventing.  What I do mind is the smugness that permeates this two-time Tony-winning (go figure...)\\"Swan Lake.\\"  At every step you can imagine Bourne patting himself on the back, his buttons bursting at how innovative and \\"new\\" his vision is.  (His send-up of classical ballet is particularly self-congratulatory.) So is Bourne doing anything special and new here?  Not really.  Okay, the swans are male, the prince is gay blah, blah, blah.  The only thing this adds up to is a new plotline -- and not a very compelling one at that. The jokes, such as they are (particularly the prince's ditsy girlfriend), wear pretty thin pretty quickly.  And the dancing itself is, for the most part, lackluster. The corps of swans especially lacks coordination, their arms flailing about sloppily.  Some might praise Bourne for not doing the same-old-same-old, but I'd rather see a superbly executed, staid version of \\"Swan Lake\\" than a supposed rethinking that doesn't really have a thought in it's precious, phony little head.
B00003CXCT|5.0|There's just no comparison.  The Star Wars films set the standard, and everything else continues to just follow in their wake.
B000035P5E|5.0|Donald Sutherland has tended to be one of our finest actors, overlooked and dismissed by many critics.  Sure, he's done some floppers (e.g. Virus), but in this movie he shows why he's such a riveting performer.  He plays the Needle, a cold, psychotic killer, who is a German spy and holds the key to knowledge of the D-Day invasion.  He ends up shipwrecked on a lonely island, inhabited only by a reclusive cripple and his devoted, if lonely, wife.  Kate Nelligan (so good in &quot;Dracula&quot; with Frank Langella) is perfect as Lucy, the woman whose need for love leads to an affair with the Needle.  Christopher Cazenove turns in a good performance as her husband, whose bitterness over his auto accident, has turned him into an uncaring, selfish man.  Director Richard Marquand keeps the movie moving at a leisurely pace, but packs some powerful suspense scenes; the score by Miklos Roza is admirable, and the scenery is lush and beautiful.  I havent' read Ken Follett's novel, but this is a great movie and hopefully did it justice.
B00000HZH7|5.0|WOW!, I just got this today, I heard they helped start Death Metal, so I had to check them out for myself, WOW, what a great band they were, Insane vocals, killer rythem/leads, brutal drumming, all out, old school Thrash/Death, definetly reccomended for ones who likes Death, Obituary, Pestilence ext, production is a bit raw, but it's not too bad, and it fits the music well, NOT FOR THE WEAK, this stuff was EVIL!
B00006CXSS|5.0|On the heels of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks co-produced this no-holds-barred HBO TV show that follows a single World War II airborne unit, Easy Company (Company E) from training to D-Day to Operation Market Garden to the Bulge to the kicking-in of the heartbreaking German concentration camps, and finally to the melancholy end of the war and, inevitably, the breaking-up of the unit as they take their first tentative steps towards becoming regular American citizens again.<br />The show does not hold back from showing death and destruction. Characters we are just beginning to care about suddenly die. This recreates the terrible cost of friendship among the soldiers themselves. <BR> <BR>Some characters are incredibly brave. Others are cowards or incompetents. The key is to avoid cartoon depictions, and demonstrate the humanity of ordinary people placed in extraordinary circumstances. Along the way, they take to the challenges placed before them and accomplish the greatest victory in history. One is left with the inevitable truth that they have done the greatest thing in 2000 years of modern history, and a world has been saved by their deeds.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>...
B00020HEL6|5.0|I saw her on television and got the CD that day! It made a great CD to listen to on my recent road trip. It's so wonderful to hear young singers and musicians doing classic material. It gives you a sense of stability in these challenging times. I really love the selections she and her producers chose for this debut album. (I didn't read the song list before I bought it and was tickled to hear Midnight at the Oasis when it started to play.)Renee has impressive control and sophistication for her age. If you like Diana Krall, Josh Groban and similar high quality artists, you will absolutely, positively, without a doubt love this CD.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Oh my...I walked out of the movie theater very disappointed after seeing The Matrix Reloaded.  However, I felt committed to seeing the third in the trilogy having invested so much time in the first two.  And I felt semi-confident that the third would be at least as enjoyable as the wonderful first Matrix.  Sadly...I was disappointed.  Again.  And not just a little bit.  Majorly.  UGH.  Halfway through the movie, I was not only wanting my money back...but also the time I had wasted.  I couldn't wait for someone -- everyone -- to just die and get this horrible movie over with.  So...I do not recommend this.  And will never.  See the first Matrix.  But let it end there.
0780631684|1.0|Wait...this is supposed to be intellectual? I don't get it...Everything about this movie is stupid. From the beginning story that death is coming after them to the all these freinds getting angry over one of them not telling who is next. Only one of them panics...and is saved? Another thing...it appears that death only tries to kill them sometimes...especially when they are alone... And another thing, if death can jam your car doors and make computers explode and make trees fall down, then they would all be dead within a minute or so. And when they are all riding in a car together, nothing happens for about a half hour! Could death make some drunk driver kill them, or have a pole crash into them? <br />And Another thing...the acting in this movie is horrendous. A friend's head is chopped off right in front of them, and they don't care they just wander away, pondering the meaning of life..All of the actors are bad. <br />Also, this movie uses grotesque gore when it is not needed. Really. It's disgusting. <br />Thankfully, I watched this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, so i didn't waste any movie viewing it.
B0000AHRB0|4.0|Ken Follett's &quot;Jackdaws&quot; is a decent WW2 action tale, a subject he is obviously enamored with.  The time is late May 1944, days prior to the Allied invasion at Normandy.  Headquartered in a chateau in Sainte-Cecile near the French cathedral city of Reims was the hub of a vast telecommuncations network funneling radio and telephone messages through occupied France to the Fatherland.  Crippling this network would provide a huge advantage to the invading Allied forces.  The French Resistance had been unsuccessful in an attempt to sabotage the chateau, resulting in the death or capture of almost the entire Bollinger Resistance group.  The group was led by ex professor Michel Clairet.  His wife, Felicity, known as Flick was also among the group.  Flick Clairet was a British major in the SOE (Special Operations Executive), acting as an undercover liason between the English and the French Resistance. Flick was well schooled in weaponry, espionage, French culture and was fluent in French.<br />Luckily escaping a Gestapo dragnet after the failure at Saint-Cecile, Flick made her way back to England.  While there a plan was formulated by the SOE to have Flick lead an all female team back into France to again try to destroy the communication center at Saint Cecile.  Five French speaking English women were recruited to parachute into France and pose as a cleaning crew that serviced the chateau on a daily basis.  Included in the group which was code named Jackdaws was a demolitions expert and a telephone engineer.<br />The biggest obstacle facing the team was German major Dieter Franck, a wily, calculating intelligence officer with expertise in interrogation and torture.  His suspicions were heightened after the aborted attempt on the chateau.  Franck using every resource at his disposal was obsessed in capturing Flick and her minions and protecting Saint-Cecile.<br />The story  goes back and forth between Flick and Franck chronicling their trials and tribulations as they both move to fulfill the objectives of their repective missions.ey both move to fulfill the objectives of their repective missions.

B00004W221|1.0|Woo hoo! So he wanted to play football for Notre Lame, and he waited and tried really really hard and he cried about it and he walked on to the team and he cried some more. Whoopdee freakin doo! A lot of people want to play college football really bad, but that doesn't mean we make a movie about all of them! Typical job of everyone sucking up to the Domers. Save your money and buy a copy of a movie with a plot that requires more than 6 seconds of rational thought.
0743424425|5.0|This is an excellent novel. It is incredibly scary and horrifiying. It is very well written, so it doesn't read like some bad junkie book. Every single thing that happens in this book is scary. King has the power to make an simple event like the elevator moving back and forth scary. Also, it is creepy to see jack slowly go insane. This is probably the scariest Stephen King novel, but maybe not the best. Also, unlike some of his other books, there are 1. no dead dogs murdered ( that makes me so upset) 2. No masses of innocents being slaughtered.<br />I strongly reccomend it. But be warned: you'll be pulling back the shower curtaing just to make sure there is no one in the bathtub!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|At the time I write this review, the overall Amazon customer rating is 3 stars, based on almost 1500 reviews.  That's fairly low for an Oscar-nominated film especially one as hyped as this one was.  Expressed numerically, that's 60%, fairly dismal on the rotten-vs.-fresh meter.  Interestingly, the film scored 94% on the real meter, which is based on the reviews of professional critics.  So it's pretty clear that the general public liked the movie a lot less than the critics.  Why would this be?<br />It's the \\"emperor's new clothes\\" effect.  A bandwagon got rolling on this film and critics were scared to seem dumber than their colleagues, so they jumped on the bandwagon.  From my perspective, problems with the film included.<br />1. It opened with a shot of Scarlett Johansen's butt, which, though often on display in the film  (Ms. Johansen went skirtless a lot), had nothing to so with the story.  The movie wasn't about butts or sex.  Or was it?  Audiences hate ambiguity. Critics love it.<br />2.  The attraction between Murray and Johansen didn't work.  She was too young, beautiful, and vacant for him.  He was too old and too smart for her.  Only one thing pulled them together: the requirements of the script.  Once together, there was no onscreen chemistry.  So the relationship was unconvincing.<br />3.  Murray seemed more tired than lonely or disoriented.  And he was rarely funny.<br />4.  The ending was one of those unoriginal ride-off-in-the-sunset type things.<br />5.  Few people in the real world believe Sofia Coppola is that much more talented as a director than she was as an actress.<br />Overall, the movie was boring... except for that opening shot.
1558216847|5.0|This book is the story about a young Polish officer who is imprisoned and tortured by the Soviets. In a mockery of a trial he is sentanced to twenty-five years in a Soviet prison camp.

B0000025VU|5.0|After reading some of the reviews, I understand this most people don't get the lyrics or the subetlies of Mark Knopfler playing which is usually in the back, beneath the overall sound with Mick Taylors guitar playing out in front. knopflers leads take quite a few listens to even hear. Lets get beyond that and get to the lyrics Jokerman is a masterpiece warning of the coming of the beast( a woman gave birth to a priest today dressed in scarlett)the only real question i have about the song is what is the Jokerman ? A country, mankind as a whole or the devil in disguise. Yes this album is full of biblical and social commentary. Neighborhood Bully is about a large portion of the worlds perception of Isarael, Man of Peace is about how the devil disguises himself, current president Bush, Arafat and host of others who seem to give goodwill in the their perception of peace. License to Kill is about man's obssesion to dominate through force and his clear abandonment of Gods laws. I and I is man inner struggle with the forces of good and evil. This Cd I have owned for over 20 years and his (Dylans) genius at wordcraft and music never fails to amaze me. For those who have'nt heard it buy it for those who have listen again and ask yourself what do you think he was refferring to when he sings the book of Leviticus  and Deutoromy,the law of the jungle and the sea are your only keeper means?
B000002NC4|3.0|On one hand, there's nothing bad about any of the songs. All of them are good. However, there are only three or four that I really got into and enjoy...the rest just kind of bore me. Those songs are I would Hurt a Fly, Out of Site(one of their best songs ever), Stop the Show, and Randy Described Eternity is OK, not as great as the other three. The rest are in no way bad songs, but I never listen to them when I pop the CD in. I'd say if you've never heard BTS, then you're better off looking somewhere's else but if you like their other albums, you will like this.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|MLS is a pleasing movie. It's not anti-male, unless you think women's only role is in the kitchen. Some good acting but the actors. It's better than I thought it would be, and not as boring as I imagined. Ginnifer Goodwin is cute too.
B000001GQR|5.0|Reviewing this release is truly a joy.  Everything about these recordings is either perfect or near perfect (and for those of you not familiar with classical recordings, that is EXTREMELY rare).  As others have noted here, the Berlin Philharmonic plays with heavenly beauty, a very particular kind of beauty (rich and weighty, but also smooth, silky, and suprisingly clear) not heard in any other orchestra, and not even heard when they were under anyone but Furtwangler.  In case you have never heard his work before, this is just about the best place to start.  His interpretations are carefully thought out, but also thrillingly spontaneous.  As observed in the liner notes, it is a testimony to his art that, after listening to these, it is hard to imagine it any other way.  His work in the studio is usually dwarfed by his live recordings, but not here.  Furtwangler was, for most of his career, antagonistic towards making recordings, in no small part due to the cruel demands of the 78 rpm record (had to be recorded in 5 (!) minute sections), but with the advent of the LP , he admitted that it was finally possible to make recordings; his changing attitude towards the medium is wonderfully preserved here.  To top it off, the sound is so vibrant and clearly defined, I cannot tell that it is mono instead of stereo (and I am a good amateur musician).<BR>     Regarding the Schubert, if you thought that he could only make beautiful, tender sounds, and was poorly coordinated, this is your chance to become a convert.  This recording of his great C major symphony has rugged strength in abundance, and Furtwangler as always gives an illuminatingly clear view of the (impressive) structure of the piece.<BR>     The Haydn, if anything, is even better!  Furtwangler gives a passionate but refreshingly unsentimental reading which, again, reveals enormous amounts of detail while at the same time fitting it into his overall conception.  The Largo is unforgettable.<BR>     In short, whether or not you are familiar with Furtwangler's work, even if you thought you disliked Schubert or Haydn, this CD is an essential purchase.
0446310786|5.0|How I missed this book in school is a mystery. Now, having read it, I proclaim Mockingbird as one of my favorites, ever. I found the story so moving and important, that I will insist my homeschooled son read Mockingbird, this summer.
B000062Y98|4.0|First of all, this album is one of BG's best, regardless of what other reviewers might say. I do agree with many of them, however. Especially when they say that this album had too much going on. If you don't have a great stereo system (or at least some good headphones) then you WILL NOT hear the genius of this album.  These musicians are obviously great individually, but when you layer them on top of each other (at least on this album)it sounds like one big mess. Also, Hansi's voice is PERFECT for this kind of music but it is overpowering on this album.  I like to hear the instruments in my music.  That is why I didn't give this album 5 stars.  Otherwise, if you are able to listen to what is going on in the background- you can tell how great this album really is.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I don't have to say much, as everyone else has already said, this is a great album.  Tarentino has always had a great ear for soundtracks.<BR>I wanted to mention a great song though that is used in the movie but not on the soundtrack or listed in previous reviews.<br />&quot;I need more love&quot; by Robert Randolph and the Family Band.<BR>Part of this song plays in the scene when the Bride faces Oren Ishi for their final battle, very upbeat, disco like with wailing guitar and syncopated clapping.  It makes for a great scene and it's a great song.
B00003CX9W|4.0|I recently viewed the 60th anniversary edition of Walt Disney's \\"Fantasia\\", and I think that this is the closest we will ever come to seeing and hearing Disney's original vision for this film. This DVD Edition sets things right by incorporating all of Deems Taylor's spoken introduction and linking narratives into the film for the first time since the film's premiere in 1940.     If anyone has seen the 1990 restoration that appeared on video in 1991, they will know to what I'm referring. In that edition we only see Taylor's face in the opening prologue. Later on, we hear his comments as a voice-over to medium shots of the orchestra as they tune their instruments. Those players on the screen, by the way, are not members of the Philadelphia Orchestra: they are actually studio musicians. The music for Fantasia was pre-recorded months prior to shooting in the Academy of Music in Philadelphia.    The DVD presents what was then known as the \\"roadshow\\" version of Fantasia, which toured a limited number of cities upon it's initial release. The film's distributor, RKO Radio Pictures, balked at the added expense involved in setting up special amplifiers and speaker systems to accomodate the requirements for the Fantasound soundtrack. The decision was made to trim some of the film's length, beginning with altering the narrative links, but also making horrendous cuts in some release prints (indeed, some later prints do not even contain the Bach Toccata and Fugue sequence.) At one point, Disney decided to take matters into his own hands and handle the distribution of the \\"roadshow\\" version himself. That version differs from subsequent release prints in that Taylor's face is visible throughought every linking narrative; and that the blue title card appears at the start of the intermission that follows Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. In the 1990 restoration the title card appears at the start of the film. Also, the original release had no screen credits: special programs with those details were distributed to patrons. The DVD edition also doesn't have screen credits, but information about the animators is touched upon during the commentary by Rudy Behlmer, et al.    With regard to the soundtrack, the original optical, nine-track elements (which were mixed down to three tracks for the master print) have been missing for several decades. In 1955, the decision was made to transfer the extremely fragile and potentially unstable nitrate soundtracks to a four-track magnetic tape, because it was feared that the original tracks might not survive for much longer. This was done by playing the original tracks at RCA in Los Angeles and relaying the audio over telephone wires to the Disney Studios in Burbank. Unfortunately, during the transfer electronic hum and other noises ended up on the tape. Also, the telephone wires cut off at 8,000 Hz, so many viewers have never heard the full frequency and dynamic range that was capable utilizing the Fantasound system (which was a precursor of today's Dolby Surround-Sound.)    For the 1990 restoration, Terry Porter of YCM Labs had reportedly removed 2,000 clicks and pops from the four-track magnetic copy. Also, using technical data from the Disney Archives, he managed to replicate the mixing format of the original optical tracks; so that the sound would eminate from the left, right, front and rear speakers as originally planned.    I viewed my VHS copy of the 1990 restoration first, so that I could make my own comparisons. The 1990 edition suffers from too much use of noise-reduction software, which makes the violins and high wind instruments sound \\"glassy\\" and distorted. I also listened to my CD copy of the 1990 restored soundtrack album. The sound on the CD was a little cleaner and well defined, but the DVD has the most improved sound. One must remember that Fantasound was an experimental process. Optical tracks, in general, while offering an expanded dynamic and frequency range, were often quite noisy. All this means that what we hear is a 60-year-old recording that is by no means state-of-the-art by today's standards, but nevertheless remains impressive in its own right.    I don't remember seeing any negative racial depictions in the Beethoven Pastoral Symphony sequence, either in 1975 or in 1981 (which had a newly-recorded digital soundtrack). Then, again, Disney wouldn't have allowed anything like that in his films. The only questionable scene shows Bacchus entering with two nubile, African Zebra-type centaurettes. I can see how that might draw an unfavorable response from viewers. In fairness, however, they are not depicted doing anything of a derrogatory nature. They come in, toss some petals, and then they're gone... Some who reviewed the DVD edition claim that something was cut from the Beethoven sequence, but I can't imagine what that could be. Certainly the music itself has been truncated, but Stokowski did that only for dramatic reasons and to maintain story continuity. All of the music in Fantasia, except perhaps the Bach, was edited from the original scores in one way or another.    I said that the DVD itself rates only 4 stars. That is because the good folks at Disney are only offering the pencil tests, unused animation, and alternate music pieces as part of the 3-DVD \\"Legacy\\" set. The extras on the single DVD are good, but one wishes the archival materials had been included as a second disc.    Post-Script 12/26/07:    Since I first wrote the above review, I have learned that there was indeed a negative ethnic stereotype that was excised from subsequent release prints of Fantasia. A black centaurette, by the name 'Sunflower' could be seen originally waiting on one of the white centaurettes (polishing her hoofs in the manner of a shoe-shine boy, braiding her hair, etc.) as they prepared to meet with their male counterparts. In subsequent prints the images of Sunflower were often obscured by zooming in abruptly to the white centaurette (which unfortunately resulted in a temporary blurring of the picture). Original character sketches of Sunflower and frame-grabs of her excised scenes in Fantasia may be viewed on the \\"Snopes\\" website, under \\"Disney\\".
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins, Blink-182.  These are some of the first bands that come to my head when you ask, &quot;What's a good Alternative band?&quot;  Add Jet to that list; because for me, at least, a band must perform well on EVERY track to even be considered for it.  &quot;Get Born&quot; is one of the very few CDs that, like albums by the aformentioned groups, can be played straight through without ever hitting an utterly unlistenable track.
B0000029DD|2.0|I was really disappointed in this album, it was a real piece of crap... I must say.  I don't understand why this guy is always compared to Elliott Smith and Nick Drake, they're so much better and so much more inovative.  Jeff Buckley... thumbs down.
B000003TA4|4.0|Alright, I suppose you can't be a legitmate rock album reviewer unless you review this album, Nevermind.<br />Everyone knows where this band stands in history, so I'll just skip that mumbo jumbo. Nevermind is a punk album w/ an introduction to grunge. Nirvana didn't create this sound, it was just the first album that was successfully commercial, thus they are legends according to the media. Oh well, Time to rate the songs, no questions asked.<br />&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; is obviously about the teen angst syndrome that haunted the society of the early nineties. &quot;Here we are now, entertain us...&quot; is forrunning motto of this generation. It's a good song w/ high emotion. Overplayed, yes, but still good.<br />Another well known song in the second spot, &quot;In Bloom&quot; which not as depressing as the former, is still a classic. Still grungy, but this is Nirvana. One of the better on the album.<br />My favorite song, &quot;Come As You Are&quot; is a dark melodic ballad where some of the lyrics are hard to pick up. Ironic in the fact that Kurt shot himself w/ the &quot;I swear, I don't have a gun&quot; part is repeated, but it's a great song to listen to when you need a good song to listen to.<br />&quot;Breed&quot; is a more punk song than a grunge song. Nothing to great about it in my opinion, but no reason to skip it. <br />The final single displayed is &quot;Lithium.&quot; Combination of subtle guitar riffs w/ stoic vocals and alt. rock head banging w/ a raging Cobain. Excellent.<br />Some people might say that the rest of the album sucks b/c there are no other singles in it. The people that own it, know otherwise.<br />&quot;Polly&quot; a 3 minute ditty about a parrott? Hardly. &quot;Polly&quot; is a poetic ride of Kurt's songwriting skill. The music isn't much though.<br />The song w/ the most punk is &quot;Territorial Pissings.&quot; Here, the lyrics aren't really much as the song is pretty much one line over and over. Just a short punk songis all. Fun to play.<br />The best non-single is &quot;Drain You.&quot; I actually like this song better than &quot;Smells..&quot; Something about it that puts you in the mood to do something constructive. I think I did my laundry to this song, oddly enough.<br />A short Nirvana type song is &quot;Lounge Act.&quot; Many people like this song for it's uptempo style play. I, for one, wish it were longer.<br />More of that punk/grunge feel is &quot;Stay Away.&quot; Lyrics are weak though. Sounds almost like &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot; in some parts. <br />I love &quot;On a Plain&quot; for it's simpistic sound. The pace is constant throughout the whole song w/ the same drum beat most of the way. The lyrics are great and Cobain sarcastically sings the words in his usual depressed manner. <br />The only song that doesn't have any punk to it is &quot;Something in the Way.&quot; Could be fitting for the last song perhaps as they stray further away from punk and rely heavily on the more grunge dark sound that &quot;In Utero&quot; perfects. <br />Revolutionary? Not to me, just another album in my collection. Could be to some fans who are Nirvana freaks, but the band is gone and we all must move on to other things. As for the king of grunge, my vote goes to Soul Asylum, who transitioned from punk to grunge in the 80's.
0783232039|3.0|Although I am a horror fan I have never been a fan of the slasher genre and had never planned to see this movie, but I just happened to watch it by accident one night and was very pleasantly suprised.<br />What places this movie a cut above the usual moronic slasher flick is an OUTSTANDING performance by Jennifer Tilly as Chucky's \\"bride\\" Tiffany. I had never seen her in a starring role before, and the whole time she was on the screen I kept asking \\"Who IS this chick? She's great!!\\" and couldn't wait to look up her name in the closing credits. -- Definitely not the usual quality of acting you'd expect in this type of B-movie.<br />After she meets her demise and is transformed into a doll, the film becomes more predictable and gradually descends more to the level of your standard Chucky flick. The late great John Ritter's talents seem wasted here in a pretty cardboard role, and unfortunately the two teen leads are never more than the typical generic \\"kids in distress\\".<br />But director Ronny Yu does seem to have some notion of his film's place within the horror genre, and there's a wonderful and inspired nod to classic horror and \\"The Bride of Frankenstein\\" during Tiffany's transformation sequence. Nice little touches like this, and the fact that this movie does not take itself too seriously and often seems more like a parody of the slasher/Chucky genre, made it even more enjoyable for me.<br />I hear that Jennifer Tilly will also be involved in the sequel currently filming, \\"Child's Play 5: Seed of Chucky\\", which should make it interesting. But I actually wish they'd go back and do a PRE-quel to this movie, focusing on living woman Tiffany's life before bringing back Chucky. -- She is one deliciously twisted, mean and sexy momma!<br />This movie has not made me a Chucky fan, but it definitely has made a new fan of Jennifer Tilly out of me. <br />In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun, mindless and light movie just to waste a couple of hours on, this one isn't bad.
B00006FDCD|2.0|..is Richard Thomas's ponytail. Honestly, this is a pretty sorry adaptation of a great book. I did not expect the film to capture all the plotlines, minor characters, and intricate themes of the 1100-page book, but I thought at least the acting, staging, and writing would be competent. They weren't. Tim Curry did a good job as Pennywise the clown, but here's the thing--&quot;It&quot; is not supposed to just be a clown; that is only one of Its guises. It represents what people are most afraid of, and embodies the evil in the town of Derry. All this is much easier to understand in the novel. If you don't have the patience to read the book, and the movie happens to be on TV, go ahead and watch it, but by no means should you spend any money on this thing.
0887307280|4.0|It's one of those books that gives you a wake up call, although some of the sections in the book does tend to wander off into the story of other peoples lives as examples, but overall the book does wake you up, I did gain alot of perspective from the book, funnly enough I did email the e-myth website to find out if they provided any e-learning services, but no reply till today for the past 2 weeks, makes you wonder??<br />A must buy book for anyone getting into the business especialy for some of us that have dealt with situations where you seem to be unable to cope with all the sudden increase of business and how to deal with them, do keep in mind that this book is very down to earth, and do keep in mind that you would require some sort of business background if you ever going to be starting a business, a recommendation as a subject of choice would be accountanting so maybe an accounting abc manual would be a good reference manual in the future in addition to this book. This book is not going to save you but will for sure open your mind.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love Christina Aguilera's new album it is very different from her Debut album she made.It has more edge &amp; alot more R&amp;B.I always loved her powerful voice.My older sister likes Christina better than Britney Spears &amp; she thinks that Christina can sing better than Britney.She is just like those other singers is Mariah,Whitney &amp; Aretha.Christina Aguilera is A DIVA!!!!
B00008WT5C|5.0|Il 1977 è l'anno della svolta per gli AC/DC: dal rock'n'roll passano ad uno stile più grezzo e pesante soprannominato heavy and roll per via di un orientamento non ancora verso il puro heavy metal ma a metà strada tra quest'ultimo ed il rock'n'roll; come risultato abbiamo un cd più effervescente rispetto ai suoi predecessori. Ecco la tracklist:<br />1) Go down: Traccia sottovalutata. Chissa perchè? forse per colpa del bigotto di turno che ha voluto imporre il proprio giudizio alle masse! Una delle poche canzoni rock'n'roll dal 1977 in poi, ma molto bella. A<br />2) Dog eat dog: La peggior canzone dell'album ma non per questo da buttare via! A-<br />3) Let there be rock: Title track travolgente con un bell riff di basso in sottofondo. Angus e Malcolm qui sono come una corrente d'aria fredda e una d'aria calda: fanno un uragano di potenza!!<br />4) Bad boy boogie: Canzone nel cui ritornello si può sentire una vena artistica risalente ai primi anni '70. Una di quelle canzoni che riescono meglio live. A-<br />5) Problem child: Canzone dove gli Young e Bon tirano fuori tutto il loro carisma (&quot;What I want I take, what I don't I break&quot;) canzone superba, peccato per il ritornello un po' troppo scontato. A-<br />6) Overdose: La mia preferita del cd. I solisti si incastonano perfettamente nei potentissimi riff partoriti dalla geniale mente di Malcolm. A+<br />7) Hell ain't a bad place to be: riff taglienti come delle rasoiate sulle balle. Assolutamente geniale! A+<br />8) Whole lotta rosie: Bè, provate solo ad immaginare di essere nel '77 e di ascoltare questa canzone a palla: è come essere nell'occhio di un tornado ( anche un mio amico ve lo può confermare...) A+<br />HEAVY METAL FOREVER <br /> <BR>A+
0609610570|4.0|By the time you gone through the first few chapters, and wonder when are we going to learn on how to execute, you suddenly realise that the writers just decided that from this chapter on we are going to show you the &quot;how to&quot; in your face execute, and the ways of not how to execute. <br />A must read for the business owners amongst us, but be prepared to be astounded by some business terminologies and vocabularies, especially for those with no previous degrees in business.<br />It does require a second read if you are going to grasp anything from the book, like most business books.
B00005JN0A|1.0|This movie is horrible, there is nothing funny about this movie.  It tries to hard to be funny and it never is.  The jokes are stupid and the movie tries too hard to be just like Roadtrip.  This movie is not even close to being as funny as Roadtrip. Roadtrip is a classic and this movie is crap.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I enjoy this CD very much. Alicia Keys has immense talent. My favorites: Heartburn, Dragon Days, Samsonite Man, many others. Although you can really hear the 70's influence (and it's pretty heavy) in many of the songs, they are still very unique and original. The fact that she plays the piano on many of the songs of course adds to her credibility. This CD is edgy, urban and interesting. Alicia is one talented young lady with a cool style.
B000026WTW|5.0|Face Dances means a lot to a lot of people, here's why:<br />1. the songwriting: superb<BR>2. musicianship: amazing<BR>3. timeliness: right on right now<BR>4. production and aesthetics: stellar (thanks Jon Astley)<BR>5. value: to some, priceless<br />i wish i could have the opportunity to work on a album of this magnitude someday. <br />...another tricky day...just another tricky day for The Who...they'll get through...<br />regards,<BR>DP
B000099T2L|1.0|The songs are way too &quot;commercial&quot; to me and just plain boring. I am not feeling this unoriginal, ordinary piece of garbage. She puts more into her image than into her music. This is crap. The best song is &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; and even that sounds like a remake of something from the seventies. Terrible album. Sorry.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Oh goodness, what are these teen's listening too. I was an 80's child and people called the music I listened to garbage (Madonna, Prince, Cyndi Lauper, Duran Duran) this is sooo bad it's not even funny. A.L. has an Alanis like wail with some nice rock guitars but it's still not as passionate as Alanis' Jagged Little Pill. Recycled guitar riffs mixed with voice \\"sweetening\\". I guess you'll get money's worth if you like that. As for me I still like Lucky Star.
0393312836|5.0|I got this book at some cheap used book section; simply because it was cheap and I remember seeing the film as a kid but I didnt really remember it that well. The William Burroughs recommendation on the back of my edition didnt harm either. <BR>A bit shallow start but I wasnt expecting a thing and that propably helped alot. As I started reading I went, after a few unknown - to me - russian looking words &quot;what the hell is this?&quot; But the brilliant black humor came right on the first page and thats how I got to know a book that I can read anytime with the same pleasure (if not more) as the first time.<BR>By far the best book Ive ever read - and Ive read ALOT of books that have similar elements but the wordplay is so special that no book comes close. Its got everything in it, this neat little novella: black humor, satire, insane violence, a new language and even some prophetic statements. <BR>If you like this one I recommend &quot;the wanting seed.&quot; Its also by Anthony Burgess. That one is a futuristic dystopian novel/la. With the same humor.
B00000633U|5.0|This is probably the first Richard Marx album that my mom ever bought for me, and probably my favorite!  I just love his ballad &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; and &quot;Angelia&quot;.  But again I was moved over his song &quot;Children Of The Night&quot;.  Other songs on here are great as well.  This is a great follow-up to his debut CD!  Rock on, Richard!
B0000C8AQM|4.0|The song you mean is &quot;chain of fools.&quot; The &quot;chang chang chang&quot; is really &quot;chain chain chain.&quot; It's an old Aretha Franklin song that is often butchered by American Idol contestants...<br />This is a great album. I love the Ramones song &quot;Bonzo goes to Bitburg.&quot; I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes good rock music.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|She should stick to acting!!!! Who told her she could sing??? This album is a joke!!!!!
B000089RVX|2.0|Many people keep saying things like this band is so fresh and original and theyve never heard anything like this and so on but thats simply not true.  The idea of have a woman front a rock band (which i am taking a gigantic leap in even calling this a rock band)  is nothing new. Just becuase this is the first mainstream band to accomplish so doesnt mean that this is an original idea.  Bands like Jack Off Jill and My Ruin have been at this game a lot longer than our little Amy Lee has, and they've done a lot more meaningfull stuff.  Sure, Amy's got a pretty decent voice and shes a beautifull woman, but the bands watered down sound and boring lyrics take away any crediditbility of those factors.  Granted, the band doesnt entirely blow all of its songs, becuase even i enjoy 'Everybody's Fool' and I would like 'Bring me to life' if it didnt have the backup singer that is so annoying you want to kill. If you want good female vocals backed up by heavy rock, check out some of Mystic Circles CDs. Just listen to the song 'Wings of Death' and you'll see thier female vocalist (who only sings on a few of the songs actually)  has a much better and much donwright cooler voice. I've seen Amy preform and she really does look like she at least tries to put some heart in it.  But the lingering doubt that this band serves only to aspire to idealistic teeny-bopper girls makes me lose hope.
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is one of the most appealing, magical, enchanted and one of the most complex soundtracks I've ever heard. I can easily compare this one to another wonderlful work from John Williams, Hook. An absolutely outstanding achievement of one of the greatest, if not THE greatest composer of movie music of our time. I can't wait till Goblet of Fire is produced and released (I hope maestro Williams scores this one, too). Two thumbs up!!!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne is the best singer ever! Her music is truely the best. I loved this CD more then &quot;Let Go&quot;. When i first heard &quot;Together&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; I just fell in love with it. I also really liked &quot;Slipped Away&quot;. That song truely touched me. If you are an Avril Lavigne fan then you need to buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0688163173|3.0|Without a doubt Lehane is an awesome writer! For that reason alone he gets 3 stars. What's up with the editing?  I have read 5 of Lehane's novels and I have loved them all but this one.  The story line had so much potential but it took a deflated turn. I really felt let down.  I like the Patrick and Angie series much better. A loyal fan!
0312319517|3.0|I founded this book to be slightly different than the previous ones I had read from the same author. The first part is boring and slow, the second part is better. Yet I did not specially liked the story. Maybe it's more fun for men than women. <BR>The idea of mentioning Osama Bin Laden and other true facts in the story is good, although I think that here . at the end they did not really added anything to the plot.
1592400876|4.0|For anyone with pet peeves about superfluous apostrophes and unclear wording, you will find catharsis in this book. Very witty, sometimes caustic, and its (yes, ITS) points are well taken. A truly innovative, maybe even revolutionary, approach to old-fashioned grammar lessons. And Don Mendosian from Utah is right about Mahesh Grossman's &quot;Write a Book Without Lifting a Finger&quot;. If you're still unable to get your writing together after &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves&quot;, don't make us suffer. Hand it off to a professional!
B00005Y6YB|1.0|I'm sorry to have to point out to those of you who think this is the complete version, but if you go to IMDb and look up Lonesome Dove, you will find that it has a 384 minute running time.  Amazon's version is listed at only 240 minutes.  That's over two hours difference from the original film, and no, we're not talking about commercials.<BR>So unless Amazon has their listed time wrong and it is actually a full 6.4 hours, you've been duped.  I wouldn't pay for less than the original length film.<br />So, the question stands for those of you who actually bought this DVD, was it 6.4 hours long, or only 4 hours long?
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Eric Clapton did a wonderful job on this cd. I'm very happy with it.
B0000DJZ9T|3.0|The shots are awesome. The music is blood-pumping fancy, blasting you into eternal bliss. The band is energetic and on top of their game. The crowd is crazy. The. editing. goes. like. this. The DVD is shot well, but the edits are just TOO MUCH! I nearly had a headache trying to watch this! Just when you barely get a look of a fantastic scene, the image is cut into another jostling cut, and so on and so forth! Definitely rent this DVD before you buy it... my fiancee and I both had a problem with the horrendous editing job. Only on a couple songs are you allowed to take in a breather and SEE the band perform a full act (like in &quot;Politik&quot; you can't even see Chris Martin finish a jump in the air - you see him jump up, but it cuts before he falls down!) It's like watching a fast MTV video for two hours. You know how THAT can be! But besides this, the music is awesome, and that is what really counts if you are interested in the band.<br />The behind the scenes documentary is very cool, with full interviews with the band, like you're riding along for the tour (which is very cool if you didn't get a chance to go to one of their concerts), and you see some of the stages being put together and what the different crowds were like. The packed crowds are breathtaking!<br />All in all, a good DVD. Skimpy on extras, horrible editing, but quality music and surround sound. A bonus CD that comes with the DVD is pretty cool, but offers nothing new if you have the DVD as background music. All in all, the music saves this disk.
1558908382|5.0|Grosse Pointe Blank is probably ranked in my list as one of the best dark comedies of all time. If you haven't seen it, just think, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; meets &quot;satire,&quot; with a little bit of typical &quot;John Cusack-ness&quot; sprinkled in here and there. (Still, Minnie Driver's character is no match for Mia Wallace in my humble opinion.)<br />It kind of makes you wonder what really goes through the minds of these so-called real-life &quot;assassins&quot; that exist in the world. Although I'm sure that it's certainly not quite a comedic vocation as portrayed in the film. Nonetheless, it's fascinating and it keeps the viewer sitting on the edge of their seat wanting more. I think that's why this movie worked. Who would of ever thought of making a farce out of something so mundane as a hitman going through a midlife crisis? John Cusack's quirky persona really makes Grosse Pointe Blank, well, Grosse Pointe Blank. On top of that, the ten year high school reunion adds yet another intricate twist in the storyline. I felt as though I had stepped into a time portal that took me back to the era of materialims, The Clash/punk rock, Sixteen Candles, side ponny tails and leg warmers, as with other fashion mishaps.<br />The dailogue, as funny as it is, really makes you think -which isn't always the easiest thing to do in a film. For example, one of my favorie lines is when Debi questions: &quot;Where are all the good men dead, in the heart or in the head?&quot; Let's just say, I ask myself the same thing...
B00000IMTF|5.0|Since Ritchie Blackmore is such an unruly and meglomanic b*tch, EVERY SINGLE MEMBER(except Ronnie) was kicked out. Even though that shows how much of an ass he is, it proved to have two desirable results. A) Those guys didn't have to deal with Blackmore anymore, and B) We gained one of Rock's best drummers, Cozy Powell (god rest the man's soul). The album starts with &quot;Tarot Woman&quot;, which is a solid rock song (even though it begins to show the constant loop that Ronnie has in his lyrics, including &quot;carousels&quot; and &quot;I don't know&quot; ;). Then we have &quot;Run with the Wolf&quot;. Eh, the only song that isn't that good. The 3rd track is &quot;Starstruck&quot;. Easily one of Rainbow's better songs. The bass is so simple (then again, so is Jimmy Bain), but it hits nice and hard. Then we have &quot;Do You Close Your Eyes&quot;. Actually, let me correct myself. &quot;Run with the Wolf&quot; is actually a pretty good song. &quot;Do You Close your Eyes&quot;, FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRT. &quot;Stargazer&quot; is a classic Rainbow song that is excellent. The album ends with &quot;A Light in the Black&quot;. This is the best song on the record. Overall, this is Rainbow's best album, and easily one of the best rock albums of the 70's.
B00025ETIW|5.0|When it seems that people disgregard this as a poppy attempt to sell out and make money, I see it as an evolution.  There are many different styles on this album, incorporating, metal, emo, screamo, post-hardcore, and others, there is even a song that reminds me of Queen, which is incredibly awesome.  If you want something that you will listen to over and over again, pick this one up, and check them out on this years warped tour.
B00026W82U|4.0|The Kings Of Convenience: soulful, sensitive, Scandinavian (tick all that apply).<br />Norwegian duo Erlend ?ye (the earnest, bespectacled one) and Eirik Glambek B?e (the enigmatic, hunky one) channel Simon and Garfunkel in Riot On An Empty Street, the follow-up to their critically acclaimed debut Quiet Is The New Loud.<br />In fact, Homesick and Gold In The Air Of Summer capture the melodic spirit of the folk duo so uncannily and so beautifully, that for a moment I thought I was listening to the wrong CD. Either that, or to a Simon and Garfunkel covers band.<br />The gentle strumming of the acoustic, nylon and steel string guitars set the offbeat, folksy mood as the duo sing together, one 'high voice', the other 'low voice', of the usual melancholy and suffering for love and art, with cut-out-and-stick-on-your-fridge axioms like &quot;a song for someone who needs somewhere to long for&quot; (Homesick), &quot;love is no big truth, driven by our genes, we are selfish human beings&quot; (Love Is No Big Truth), and the &quot;summer child that sits by the water, weaving sunlight threads in his hands&quot; (Live Long).<br />Interspersed between the occasionally austere folk songs are fleet-footed melodies and whimsical words, but the messages remain consistent: gentle advice (&quot;A friend is not a means you utilize to get somewhere&quot;, Misread) and sepia-tinted, idealised memories (&quot;These canals, it seems, they all go in circles, places look the same, and we're the only difference&quot;, Cayman Islands). A guest appearance by the current-toast-of-Paris/Jane Birkin-look-a-like Feist on Know-How only cements the album's chic-ness.<br />The Kings Of Convenience have an undeniable appeal to those who adore fruit-infused tea, minimalist furniture and staring out through blurred windowpanes on dreary rainy days.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|Upon viewing the first two Matrix movies, I began to have a greater appreciation for sci-fi movies.  The Matrix Reloaded, though a bit long, was a great movie (even though some consider it the worst in the trilogy).  However, this.......this ending to the trilogy, if that's what you want to call it, flat out sucks!!  This movie went nowhere, and absolutely tanked from start to finish.  I seriously had trouble staying awake the first two times I saw it.  I only watched it a third time to make sure that the plot really was as lousy as I thought it was.  This is one of the most dissapointing movies I've ever had the misfortune of viewing (almost as dissapointing as Sandler's version of Mr. Deeds).  Everyone giving this movie more than 2 stars must have seen this movie about a zillion times and found some sort of a plot in there that they made up in their minds so as not to give their precious Matrix movie less than three stars.  Gimme a break!  I might as well be staring at my empty fridge hoping some food will just march right in there!  <br />  First of all, what the hell was with that scene where Neo is stuck in some &quot;between&quot; world, and no one will let him out?  Why does that scene take up like half the movie?  Why did the Wachowski brothers feel it necessary to include such a pointless scene?  Hell, why did they make this movie's &quot;plot&quot; the same (except of a lower quality) than Reloaded's plot?  Really, it's the same damn movie &quot;Zion is being invaded by the Machines; Neo is 'the one' who will save Zion; and here's the big twist.....Trinity dies!!! (don't worry, I didn't ruin the movie anymore than it has ruined itself).  There's a nice and graphic scene where these big robots are shooting some people or something (again, I don't give a damn about being accurate here; this scene was pointless.  However, if you like sci-fi graphics and whatnot, this is the scene for you).  Basically, nothing changes from the second movie, the actors had ZEROscript to work with, and this was the worst 6+ hours I've ever spent.  Maybe you don't like that I didn't take the time to explain every aspect of the movie so that I sounded more authoritative on why scenes didn't work.  But hey, if the what's-their-name brothers can be so unprofessional in a movie, then why should I give a f*ck?  F*ck this movie, f*ck the directors, and f*ck any future movies that are destined to suck as bad as this one did.
B00006RINF|5.0|I just recently saw this band in concert opening up for P.O.D. I had never heard of them before that, but I was so impressed with their live performance that I couldn't leave the show without buying their cd. This is the way I imagine gothic music to actualy sound, unlike most of it's popular counterparts. Although they are very calm and melodic, they are at the same time still prety heavy. Which is cool because you can crank them up when you want to rock out or also put them on a low volume to calm your spirit. They do remind me of Evanescence only just a little, but only because Amy and Cristina both look and sound simalar to each other. Instramentaly though I think they are very different sounding. All the songs on this cd are realy good, but right now my two favotite songs are &quot;Swamped&quot; and &quot;Daylight Dancer&quot; Buy this cd, you'll love it.
B00004Z459|1.0|Oh God; I am so f*cking sick of hybrids like rap/rock that bring a disgrace to both genres of music!  Like so many of the rap/rock (and yes, some losers still will replace the word &quot;rock&quot; with &quot;metal&quot; creating the oxymoron &quot;rap/metal&quot; -- metal is a pure form; period!) groups out there today that suck (Rage Against the Machine, Limp Bizkit), Linkin Park focuses on the same lame angst and of course, no specific reason for their hatred is ever explored.  &quot;Hey, I'm a whinny teen!  Maybe I'll just scream and rap about being grounded by my mommy, and maybe I'll go platinum!!!&quot;  Maybe if such groups actually focused on that thing called MUSIC, this formula wouldn't suck so bad!  And by music, I mean more than pounding on drums (maybe a solo would be nice), screeching out power chords on guitars (again, a solo would be nice), and, for the love of God, get rid of that stupid DJ and fake wanna-be rapper!  Finally, for those of you ignorant fools who will just as easily label me a &quot;jealous hatER (NOT spelled with an &quot;a&quot; at the end) should realize how much I'd want to die if I made money off of being in a sh***y band like this.  Rap can only ruin good rock.....end of story!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i was totally shocked after listening to this cd.  all the reviews made it sounds horrible but it was quite the opposite.  yeah sure they aint crazy heavy metak anymore but who cares they are displaying pure talent now.  they are true heavy metal now.  yeah there may be some slower songs but they still rock and that is all that matters.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I'm impressed. Ashton Kutcher's performance along with the rest of the cast was great. The story was very deep and spectacular. I was expecting a lot less but it turns out the movie was really good. Anyone who liked Final Destination 2 who like this movie. This is the best acting I've seen so far from Ashton Kutcher. He should make more serious movies like this, he would be great for the part because he is such a good actor.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|Sixty and still sexy, Harry (Jack Nicholson) is having the time of his life, wining, dining and bedding women half his age. When he meets an auctioneer (Amanda Peet) and agrees to go to the Hamptons with her, he's convinced he's in for a sinfully fun weekend. Plans go awry when her playwright mother, Erica (Diane Keaton), stops in unannounced, and Harry soon discovers there's nothing wrong with -- and plenty good about -- acting your age.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Though many people have different tastes I found Under My Skin to be far from dissapointing. For many artists their second CD isn't as big of a success as their first. But in Avril's case, however, I'm torn between Let GO and Under My Skin. She mixes up the sound through out the cd and it could be classified under many different genres. It's written about old boyfriends, standing up for yourself, and even summer boredom. While seemingly a bit more mature than the the first, I recommend it to anyone who liked Let Go or anyone who is looking for something new.
0156907399|5.0|So here we have Mrs Woolf masterpiece, her great achievement at grasping time. This is a book for those that like a challenge in reading. It is not passive reading, Virginia needs your whole attention throughout the novel, and if you are lucky and get inside you will hace a wonderfull experience, you will be there with her and the characters, reading with a dim light, saling towards the lighthouse, painting, the air will brush your face and you will smell salt and sea and be dizzy after lunch. I do not Know if what she tells really interested me because it was jus something you experiment. Good chance
B00003CXCT|4.0|I may be from a diffrent genreation, and i may not have been there in the theaters from the beginning, but i do understand its impact and greatness. These three movies took sci-fi/fantasy to a new and real level. Now movies of that genre arent laughed at, they are worshiped. The special edition sucks, but i would rather watch Star Wars on DVD, with the surround sound, and enjoy, than have to stare that those crappy tapes i wore out. These movies tainted are still better than the new trilogy, so lets be thankful we now have them on DVD, and maybe we can look for the original edition someday. so just give in, and enjoy, or you can be upset.We all love them, and now we can enjoy them. thanks for reading, and try to listen to me
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After catching most of the shows on TV I was disappointed (actually really upset and cussing) when it was canceled.  A year and a half later as I'm browsing through the rows of DVD's I find the complete series, so I bought it! Then I felt my fascination with the show come back to life after the first episode of Serenity. Two days pass and I've watched all the episode's along with the special features and am starting over. A google search reveals Universal is in works to make a TV Movie called Serenity set for release in 2005. Go Brown coats!
0312263120|1.0|This book was a terrible disappointment.  I have read this other three books and this was the dullest.  No real excitement until the last 30 pages - at most.  The Da Vinci Code, Agnles and Deamons and, to some degree, had plot twists, tension and excitement, along with characters you could relate to.  No so in this book.  Save your money.
B000002L9B|5.0|This album is more consistently entertaining than &quot;1999&quot; and every bit as good as &quot;Purple Rain,&quot; though its sound is a bit less theatrical than that masterful predecessor. While those earlier albums bank on monster hits like &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; or &quot;Delirious&quot; for their success, here the immortal &quot;Kiss&quot; is only the beginning -- and hardly the most interesting aspect -- of what &quot;Parade&quot; has to offer. A great companion to this album is another overlooked 80s soundtrack: &quot;1984&quot; by the Eurythmics, an album on which Dave Stewart's talent for production blossoms into a taut beat-making machine. Like &quot;Parade,&quot; there are moments on 1984 that anticipate the industrial sounds we would get from later bands like NIN or much of Richard Thompson's clanging 90s work. As always, though, Prince never settles for one sound here, yet still manages to weave a constant melodic thread through each song that gathers the album into a cohesive and engaging experience.<br />From the quietly gorgeous instrumental, &quot;Venus De Milo&quot; to &quot;New Position's&quot; tinge of Reggae and the haunting flutters of muffled trumpets that make cameos throughout the album, &quot;Parade&quot; laids the groundwork not just for its immediate successor, &quot;Sign 'O The Times,&quot; but also for the jazzy pause of &quot;News.&quot; While the accordions and strings on &quot;Do U Like?&quot; might have pushed &quot;Parade's&quot; ambitious envelope a bit oo far, still it is a tribute to the confidence and versatility Prince's reputation is founded on. As if to promise the glory that was to come with 1987's &quot;Sign 'O The Times,&quot; &quot;Parade&quot; ends on a note of heartbreaking tenderness with the exquisite &quot;Sometimes it Snows in April,&quot; a ballad that found its fuller realization in &quot;The Cross&quot; the following year, arguably the most sincere and moving song Prince has ever put to tape. That said, though, the stripped-down rainy-day sound of &quot;Sometimes it Snows in April&quot; goes to show that Prince can dim the candles just as easily as he raises them into blazing infernos. To Prince's newer or more skeptical fans, &quot;Parade&quot; is a sure bet after becoming familiar with the more noted productions that preceded it.ugh, the stripped-down rainy-day sound of &quot;Sometimes it Snows in April&quot; goes to show that Prince can dim the candles just as easily as he raises them into blazing infernos.

B00006J9OT|4.0|Diana is awesome on this one. She shows her talent to the hilt in Paris... live at that . I am really impressed and surprised how beautifully arranged this cd is .
B000002L7R|5.0|Someone at Rolling Stone must have branded this album &quot;psychedelic&quot; upon its release, and everyone else in music journalism willingly brayed along. But if by &quot;psychedelic&quot; we mean stuff like Tommy James &amp; The Shondells' &quot;Crimson &amp; Clover,&quot; The Beach Boys'&quot;Wouldn't it Be Nice&quot; or The Beatles' &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends,&quot; &quot;Around The World in A Day&quot; hardly qualifies. It takes more than the scattered appearances of tambourines and strings to justify cagetorization as a full-fledged &quot;psychedelic&quot; album, I think. Prince's &quot;Around The World In A Day&quot; is less a nod to psychedelia than it is another of his great 80s pop records, teeming with those explosive drum beats, synths and subtle funk grooves. While the masterful &quot;Raspberry Beret's&quot; string arrangements evoke vague recollections of &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; or &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; still the song's thump and groove are entirely Prince's own glorious concoction. Yet while he extends the delights of &quot;Purple Rain&quot; here, there is also an element of maturity and a deepinging of his skills as a songwriter on beautiful ballads like the understated &quot;Condition of the Heart&quot; with its lilting vocals, the tender &quot;Paisely Park&quot; or the luscious and immediately catchy &quot;Pop Life.&quot; As always, Prince had already grown by leaps and bounds in just the single year between Purple Rain and this album. While that rapid growth has tended to both infuriate and bewilder fans over the years, Prince was too close to his glory at the time of this release to serve up anything less than a masterpiece, no matter what the experiment.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is a very poweful and touching film. All the actors do an amazing job and this is Eastwood' best work (as a director) since &quot;A Perfect World&quot;. There is one thing that doesn't make sense, though -- the two killers, one of them loved by the victim. Why do they beat her with bats and kill her? What for? Money? Fun? You tell me why these little monsters had to kill a 19-year-old girl. I like movies where you can watch them 100 times and still discovering new things, like in &quot;Chinatown&quot; or &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. I don't think is the case with Mystic River, but I'll watch it again for the third time and who knows, maybe there is an explanation for the killing, which occurs off-screen. However, Mystic River still is a great achievement.
B000002VCT|5.0|Over the years this has become my favorite album of Alan Parsons!!!  The only problem is its under 40 minutes long !!! Heres something somebody pointed out to me on the song Can't Take It With You hear the backing vocals singing One More River!!!  From the opening  track to the finish just sit back and enjoy a truly great album it doesn't get better than this !!!!
078322608X|5.0|Yet another film that views the future of humanity as a grunge pit, about as darkly as Gilliam's own &quot;Brazil&quot;, but houses a fiendishly perfect underlying message.<br />The film has all the workings of a modern thriller. The time travel intrigue is very credibly done and the plot is riveting. The decor looks cobbled together from the debris of the 20th century. Cities are either scabby Skid Rows or towering skyscrapers. Scientists still work in laboratories that look like old postcards of Thomas Edison inventing. Bizarre killers and villains are hurled at our protagonist (Cole, played by Willis), and there are many bloody fights.<br />Bruce Willis is superb in his rendition of a man from the future, especially his impish reverie on listening to simple music. Brad Pitt does more than he typically does in movies, which is perhaps why he overdoes it. He almost makes the manman he plays a laughable caricature.<br />But all of this is just the plumbing for what the movie is really about -- its vision. With a little pondering, forced or naturally invoked, one can actually identify with all the craziness of this movie. Beneath its slick sci-fi veneer, it actually couches a rather gloomy message of how we are letting our supposed technological advancement govern our fate.<br />Brilliiant script, excellent visuals, and some delectable but pithy insanity. Highly recommended, to purchase, not just rent.
B000002NJS|3.0|Despite the album being overhyped, well extremely overhyped...there are tracks on this album that I still listen to 7 years after its release. Those tracks are  Frozen, Swim, and Ray of Light as well as Candy Perfume Girl. The other ones are either poor or mediocre. (...)<br />(...)
B00029NMRM|1.0|This will rank right up there in my list of aimless films with a forced and pedestrian plot, that are made simply to rake in some more juice from a Part 2 of a moderately successful Part 1. The gags are so uncomical, the execution so muddled, and the editing so sloppy that Matthew Perry's character gets it right-on when he starts exclaiming about how confused he is by how everything turns out. The audience can surely feel his pain. What a lazy and irrelevant sequel to Nine Yards, which was at least bearable for what it was.
0345363132|5.0|This is my all-time favorite book; I re-read it every year.  Besides being responsible for me changing my major at university and falling absolutely in love with medieval history, this book is thoroughly entertaining to those who may not have a history passion or even passing knowledge of the time period.  Penman is detailed enough to help along readers with little to no knowledge of medieval British history, but enthusiasts will delight in her detail and character development.  If you have even a remote interest in history, Richard III, or murder, intrigue and deceit, read this book!!
B000005E60|4.0|If you are a fan of this great piece and haven't heard the (out of print) recording by Ricardo Chailly and the Concertgebouw -- buy it used, now: Polygram Records, #425832.  It has all of the clarity and insight of this Boulez performance, but it also has great big dollops of humor, passion, wonder, mystery, etc.; it lets go. It also includes Berio's late orchestral masterpiece, &quot;Formazione&quot;, as well as the chamber orchestra version of the &quot;Folksongs&quot; wonderfully sung by Jard Van Nes. The greatest Berio CD -- program, performance -- I know of.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|Mystic River is the type of movie I really wanted to like. And ten minutes into the whole thing, I was prepared to do just that.But after those brief ten minutes flew by, all my hopes went out the window, and I spent the rest of the two hours simply trying to pay attention.<br />I think that everyone is familiar with the plot by now, no? But even if not, I don't want to spoil it for those who want to see it still(because I personally hate when that happens).<br />For me, I found many different things wrong with this movie.For one thing, and this is something I'm getting quite used to comming across, the acting was way overrated.Don't get me wrong, it was \\"good\\"< but there was very little about the performances here that moved me.Sean Penn give a totally mediocre performance.His acting is just all over the place; one minute he's a loving devoted father,the next he's stiff as a tree, and the next he's a foul-mouthed gangster.I get that people have \\"dimension\\", but this was just too much.I also find myself feeling very little during his \\"grieving\\" scenes for his dead daughter.He went over the top, AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY see his making an effort to burst into tears.I'm gonna pretend to find it funny that one reviewer compared Penn to Marlon Brando.He's as much of a Marlon Brando as Sarah Michelle Gellar is Merryl Streep. Kevin Bacon had nothing much to work with, and throughout he just looked lost.Also, the sub plot with his wife who kept calling and not saying anything was dumb, unnecessary, and annoying.Tim Robbins, I think, gave the only believable performance of the bunch.Throughout he was commited and \\"inside\\" his character if you know what I mean.As for the supporting cast-Lawrence Fishburne has a nice screen presence, and does good because he's not given much to work with.Marcia Gay Harden-although I never really got to know her character, or her motives, I thought her acting was pretty good, if not a little whiny during some of the emotional scenes.And why the heck was Laura Linney even in this?As Penn's wife, not only was her character cold and unlikeable, she's given about five minutes of screen time, and then she shows up in the end with this big Macbeth speech that runs for about ten minutes!What?Also, he Boston accent was laughable.I happen to like many of the actors here on a regular basis, so something tells me the spotty acting had something to do with the direction-which fails to set a definitive tone for the film, and like the acting jumps all over the place.<br />I also found this movie emotionless.Like, during Penn's grieving scenes,or the scene where Penn's daughter is found dead, among others(so as not to spoil the plot), I didn't feel a thing.I also had to laugh at the people who said this  film was thought-provoking, and \\"deep\\".What exactly is deep or thought provoking about it?What does it manage to say that hasn't been said thousands of times before?Not only are its themes not particularly original, the whole film is executed in an even less compelling way-making you simply not care about what it is trying to say,let alone what happens along the way.<BR>The ending could not have been more unfullfilling.The movie never seems to go anywhere-when a good film ends, you're supposed to feel something-anything.I felt nothing when Mystic River wrapped up.I also thought the film was awfully paced-most of it is very slow and uneventful-and then these big climax like events are thrown at you and you're supposed to give a damn.<br /> A couple minor glitches were the atrocious, overwrought,and out of place score which sounded like it should belong in Titanic.And the setting which everyone kept talking about looks like your average studio setting to me.<br />Mystic River isn't an awful film,but its got some major flaws, and not much on the good side.It is a film with little depth, little emotion,bad pacing, and very overrated acting.Totally missable-I'ms ure you've seen better.
0060920084|1.0|I was out in Philadelphia - a very fun and interesting city (if you ignore this book)- when I read this book. What an incredible disappointment.  &quot;Razor sharp wit&quot; is too kind of a description of Bryson's wit. Bryson is down right mean in this book. This is a man who made a conscious decision not to live in the United States who returns to supposedly find his &quot;roots&quot; in Iowa. Hey, keep your eyes open. Bryson was more intent on beating it as fast as he could across America to get a book to print for his editors. Although I do agree, the Midwest can be &quot;heavy&quot; even from the perspective of this home-grown Illini, the Midwest also has the most genuinely nice people, pork as a main food group, the best county fairs, little league and every rib fest known to mankind.  He seems to have overlooked the POSITIVE aspects of Americans by only reaching for the surface.  A Walk in the Woods is a much more enjoyable and funny read than this book. Obviously, putting one foot in front of the other makes one look closer at one's surroundings. Don't waste your time with this one.
B00024BHTC|5.0|ONCE is not the best Nightwish album. Maybe I am wrong, but I think they are experimenting the new kind of metal in Europe. <BR>Soundtracks are now everywhere, also in Once. But, with &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot; or &quot;Creek Mary's Blood&quot;, you may think that this is something new for you... and it is.<BR>Well, this is my opinion. Once is not the best album of Nightwish, but is one that I could play in my cd player everyday.
B00023B1Y4|5.0|WOW NOW THIS IS HOW BLACK HAWK DOWN IS SUPPOSED TO SOUND!!!THE DTS TRACK ON THIS SUPERBIT DVD IS ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL.THE OLD DOLBY TRACK ON THE REGULAR EDITION DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH OOMPF FOR ME.IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS YOUR FRIENDS WITH YOUR HOME THEATRE SOUND BUY THIS DVD!!!
B0000BXGCN|5.0|AFTER FIRST LISTENING TO MS. FABIAN IN 2000,  I BECAME AN INSTANT FAN OF HER MAGIC. THIS LIVE COMPILATION OF MOSTLY PREVIOUSLY RECORDED MATERIAL IS PROOF OF HER ENIGMATIC VOICE. YES, INDEED SHE HITS THOSE SKY-HIGH NOTES, BUT WHEN SOMEONE CAN SING WITH SUCH SKILL IT GOES WITH THE TERRITORY (I'M NO FAN OF PUNY VOICES).<br />HER SOUND IS A COMBINATION OF POWER AND VULNERABILITY WHICH HER MUSIC & LYRICS ALLOW HER TO CONVEY. I'M AMAZED AT HER VOCAL ACROBATICS WHICH FEW OTHERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO EVEN DARE ATTEMPT. SHE IS A MASTER OF HER CRAFT.  GO ON LARA, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO BEST.
B00005JM0B|2.0|For a long time there has been talk about a Terminator 3. T2 ended perfecttly. Not as grimey and dark as the first one, but it worked great. Anyone who thinks this movie is good either wasn't expecting much and just took it as the popcorn summer blockbuster it tried to be, is really young and hasn't seen the first two Terminators and compared, or just a retard who loves corny humour and shows like Queer as folk.<BR>Why oh why????<BR>Almost everything was terrible.<BR>The new John Connor was not good at all. Claire is cute at most but definitely couldn't fit this role if her life depended on it. The Terminatrix acting was great but a female terminator is just corny. They knew they couldn't top the sick liquid metal villian in part 2 so they figured hey we need something NEW.<BR>Why not a female terminator? NO<BR>Her expressions and acting were good for playing an unemotional terminator and she did the best she could with the screenplay.<BR>By the way, shes drop dead gorgeous.<BR>Ending was depresssing- sets up a Terminator 4 where John COnnor becomes the leader??? (...) <BR> (...) THATS THE ONLY THING T3 SHOULD HAVE AND COULD HAVE BEEN. WHAT OTHER POSSIBLE STORYLINE COULD TAKE PLACE. AND TECHNICALLY THEY ENDED IT WITH T2 ANYWAY!!!! <BR>doesn't make sense.<BR>SO FOR MONEY????? They repeat the same Terminator 2 storyline.????<BR>TERRIBLE. i cant express how horrible the concepts in this film are.<BR>IF they wanted to make a part 3 of these classic movies and some how make everything that happened in part 2 completely pointless, at least set it up in the future with sick special effects, a tough lookin John Connor destroyin the endo-skeleton terminators, flying machines, and a couple T1000's. That would make more sense????<BR>Plus people are sayin Arnold looked good for his age.<BR>Granted hes older and he can't really hide his signs of aging that well, but the only reason he was in good shape was because he lost a lot of weight for the role. Compare body sizes in all 3of the films. <BR>BOTTOM LINE-<BR>Half descent movie at most if u watch the film without knowledge of the first 2 films and just want to watch an action no-brainer that makes no sense.<BR>But compared to the first 2 this is COMPLETE GARBAGE, CRAP, DISGUSTING WRITING AND TERRIBLE ACTING.<br />P.S.<BR>Sequels are great.<BR>(...) <BR>DONT BE SURPRISED IF THEY COME OUT WITH A T4- THE SECOND RISE OF THE MACHINES-FOR REAL THIS TIME. WIth the ROCK or Vin Diesel (ARnolds a governor now) playing the Terminator, and a midget Terminator that nobody would suspect.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I long anticipated a second release from this great artist.  I won't waste your time listing all the tracks, since they can be found up above under the album info.  She has a unique style all of her own, which could be classified under many different music genres.  I truly believe that Avril's songs have a lot of personal meaning to her, which allows her to really draw one into her music.  Great job Avril!  Keep the music coming!
0345423496|1.0|Yes, the plot is thin. Yes, the characterization is feeble at best. Yes, his philosophical and social commentary is hardly argued. I can deal with all that. Too many hours of television can lower anyone's standards. But the reason I read books (especially science fiction) is to be lost and believe in a grand mysterious worlds. I want to see the monoliths. I want to hear the conversations between Poole and Hall/Dave. I want feel it once as if I'm there. And that, above all it's faults is where this book has gone tragically wrong.<br />How Arthur C. Clarke has managed to transform possibly FACINATING scenes and descriptions into unbearably weak second hand accounts is beyond me. Half of the book reads as a series of half-hearted e-mails, and the other is utterly void of energy or lyricism. This is more a book synopsis than a book itself. The cardinal rule of writing is &quot;Show. Don't Tell&quot;, but in this fizzle of a sci-fi legacy Clarke reduces the mystery of the star child to a yawn enducing radio treatment.<br />Juse because he's written a lot of good books in the past, shouldn't allow him to get so sloppy.
B00005YXZH|2.0|AM - Wilco tries to be the Stones.  They're not the stones, they're not Gram Parsons, but so what I've heard all the stones songs and all the Gram Parsons songs a million times.  I wanna hear something slightly different, but the same if ya know what I mean.  Good, but to play when I'm so sick of the originals.<br />Being There - Same as AM review, but slightly more experimental. It could have been interesting, but its not.  Some more killer stonesy songs however.<br />Summertime - Abandoned the stones/Gram for the Beatles/Brian Wilson sound.  I actually like it better.  It's no less derivative, but I do like it better than their stones rip-offs.<br />YHF - White Album???????  I like it, but then my wife started to like it too and I started to get really sick of it.  Definately a beatles rip-off.  The more experimental stuff doesn't quite work cause Tweedy isn't really a musician.  He can't pull off like the Beatles/George Martin/Brian Wilson/etc.  Its enjoyable.
0446677450|5.0|Oh what a difference following the Rich Dad philosophy has made on my life. Financially secure, able to give my family the things they want, living in a nicer newer home paid for by passive income ala Rich Dad's advice. Self employed, no longer tied to a bench or a desk, working 9-5 in that boring 40x40 lifestyle.<br />Also in control of my investments instead of letting unsrcupulous so called financial people watching my money and then after a few years, I wondered if they were still watching it because I never saw it again.<br />No longer doing to brokers (so called because they make you broker and are usually broker than you are) but in control and taking advice only from brokers who I have carefully interviewed and trust. Ask these discountr brokers how much they have made following their own advice or better yet ask them to fax or email a list of their best investments. The response will usually be &quot;Huh&quot; or CLICK!<br />I will be forever grateful to Robert Kiyosaki for sharingt he principles of wealth that his rich dad shared with him.
0385508417|4.0|I thought this book was hilarious! I felt for the poor guy in the book knowing how sometimes Christmas can become ridiculous and not focusing on the things that it is supposed to be about.
0812548094|5.0|very good book. its that simple. long and good i wish #7 and 8 had been this good-read other reviews of these books for longer thoughts about these books- ok i may go into some detail- very good book be cause this book is all creation- the whole book is furthering the plot of the series definetly worth reading- some people are turned of by books that are just under a thousand pages- don't be this book is worth the effort to read and you will enjoy it- if you don't enjoy it at least you don't know where i live... oh wait you do, well not my address at least... hahahahaha ok thats enough
B00005NTJK|3.0|One of my favorite albums ever - doesn't really need any improvement but nice to have  in the convenient CD form.  I also appreciated the liner  notes by Ian since I have always wanted some personal background on this era that led to this great music. Unfortunately it seems this  was a somewhat depressing period in Ian's evolution and he seems to kind of want to forget this part and get on with the next 'big one' so maybe that's why the project seems kind of flat.  I liked the additions from Living in the Past but was disappointed with the same old USA version of Teacher and like another reviewer said I don't like the UK edition that much but it should have been there. Why not have included both? Also I think there was some other material they played at the time or live stuff that could have made a more enjoyable remastered version.  But, at least now I don't have to get up and flip the record after for michael collins,jeffrey and me!
0553573403|5.0|i would give this book ten stars if in could but i can't why are the people at amzon so cruel... ok back to the point- the book is one of the best fantasy i've read in a long time i would compare this book to even harry potter- it is a gripping story and better than harry potter in the since that it is more adult and not for children under ten. if you have heard that the book is not worth reading than somebody lied to you and you should go hunt the person down and make them read it again so that they like the book... don't miss out on this exciting book and my exciting reviews... i am so self centered............ ok it was a really good book so read it!..or else...
B00007LTIA|5.0|I'm not especially a prog rock fan, but I like this album. Up to Fragile (included), Yes was rather clumsily (in a relative way) putting together different musical parts to form songs, without achieving fluidity. One example would be the bland repetition of the piano theme on &quot;Hearts of the sunrise&quot;. On this album, it works better. What's responsible for its bad press is mainly the ridiculous trick that consisted in giving names to whole sides without distinguishing between the tracks which composed them; the truth is this album is just a collection of rather short songs, probably more so than other Yes albums.<br />One more precision: I never tried to understand what the words were about, and I sense that it's partly the reason for the good relationship I always managed to keep with this album.
B000025XKM|5.0|It is a damn good thing that this man is not alive today. His purity and ethics would have left him in an even deeper state of depression if he were to suffer the fandom his music has earned him as well as the use of his music for commerical purposes. People this sensitive are gifts to the world, but they usually implode and lack the coping mechanisms to survive in modern society. Nick was a walking open wound, a raw exposed nerve and one listen to his art will reveal this.  What an amazing thing that he was open enough and talented enough to bear his soul in a way that makes us feel ours so. The second track, &#34;Place to Be&#34; makes my chin quiver, and I am not ashamed to admit it.  There is something exquisite, decadent and enlightening about indulging in this artist's &#34;dark&#34; music.  Depressing and melancholy? Yes, certainly. Beautiful, nuanced, and intimate? More so.  I can say, as a heterosexual male that if I had a time machine, I would go back to 1972 and embrace this guy, tell him everything will be alright, and take him of a road trip through the wilderness.  And I'd bring a tape recorder.
1400032717|3.0|I've heard rave reviews about this book but I was not impressed.  I think the first half the book is great and wish it had continued in the same fashion.  I think it definatly was written from a unique perspective and the story intrigued me.....for the first 100 pages.  The direction of the book changed completly.    It started as  a carefree, amusing glimpse into the life of a 15 year old boy with Aspersers who's trying to solve a mystery.   It ended up not really being a mystery at all and more about the dynamics of his family.  I thought it ended rather depressing.  I don't see how this book was written for children!  I'd recommend it if you feel like reading something different.
B000066F6H|5.0|Like the phrase says, there is NO salvation without the hives. They are a brillant fab band. Their music is fun, upbeat, and original. buy the cd. Trust me its that good. I want to pick a favorite song, but i can't. Their new album drops July 20th so be sure to go out and buy it!
B000002U82|1.0|this is the greatest thing i have ever heard. i love this album. this melts my soul. boom! shuck! black shuck!
B00005JK8K|2.0|It is a well done typicall Hollywood movie but I have seen all this so many times. Everything is so predictable. The  movie with such great actors as Nicolas Cage and Christian Slater doesn't have any material for them to work with. I was shocked that such inventive director as John Woo could make such lame movie. Not recommended.
0743244249|3.0|Right from the beginning, this book gives you an eerie feeling.  It has an unsettling mood, set off initially by being told that the young 28-year old hero/tycoon hasn't slept in 4 to 5 days.  You don't have to stretch your imagination much to realize that weird, unpredictable things are going to happen and that his life is out of control, because he's not thinking clearly.  He's doing things in an 'out of body' way.  And added to this personal out-of-kilter state, the author adds a series of punishingly, over-the-top events to make life even more hapahazard for him, as he rides uptown and crosstown in Manhattan in his limousine, looking for a barbershop.  On the way, there are stops for sex; there are rambling conversations with advisors; there are encounters with a rioting mob pounding the limousine; there's a stop to watch two kids play basketball; there's another stop to play a bit part in a movie nude scene.  On tenth avenue, he reaches the barbershop that he has been symbolically seeking in the neighborhood that his father grew up in.  He meets his father's old barber and the story, for a moment takes on a palpable reality, with the clipped dialogue between him, his driver and the barber.  Then there is the final encounter with a disgruntled employee, seeking his revenge.  Heavy stuff.  More palatable than Chuck Palahniuk, however, and with some great scenes, such as in the barbershop.  But, hey, aside from that, this guy is unbelievable.  He didn't have the gumption to save himself, and the book doesn't offer one good reason why he didn't.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Usually the more people who tell me I 'have' to see a movie or listen to a certain singer, the less likely I am to do it. I should have stuck with that plan! I finally saw this movie after hearing everyone call it a masterpiece and I hate how everyone is saying you are stupid if you don't 'get it'. I didn't like it (nor did my parents) and I don't consider myself (or them) stupid. Although I am stupid for listening to the reviewers. About halfway through (during one of the eighty scenes when they were singing karaoke) I picked up a book and started reading it while this movie droned on in the background. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is boring and asinine.
B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp's deft performance as a writer threatened by a &quot;fan&quot; for stealing his work makes &quot;Secret Window&quot; a worthwhile film to watch.  etween the exceptional support by the rest of the cast and the sharp direction by writer/director David Koepp, &quot;Secret Window&quot; manages to transcend the limitations of Stephen King's fine if predictable novella from &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot;. In this case, style triumphs over substance as Koepp and his collaborators invest &quot;Secret Window&quot; with enough visual invention for three movies.<br />The film looks marvelous on DVD. The various featurettes about the making of the movie includes some of the previsualization footage allowing you to see how Koepp's carefully orchestrated direction adds to the tension of the film. We also get to see some of the footage that Depp shot with rehearsal footage, outtakes, and actual footage that was redubbed. Why is that important? Well Depp breaks into impersonation mode doing Brando, DeNiro and a whole host of other actors as he works his way through the character. The commentary track by Koepp is particularly revealing as he discusses why he chose not to go with the alternate ending (it's included as an extra) and some of the visualization choices he made as a director and writer.<br />While &quot;Secret Window&quot; comes across as a tad predictable, the exceptional performances from the entire cast and the directing choices Koepp makes certainly keeps this glimpse into someone else's secret window. With a high definition transfer and a nicely arranged 5.1 mix, &quot;Secret Window&quot; makes for an entertaining DVD.
B00003CXA6|3.0|Gods and Generals is without peer however Gettysburg is better than most. It trys to be balanced and succeeds well. The beards were awful and some of the language was stilted. Sheen's portrayal of Lee was laughable. Still it somehow manages to work in part because so many of the minor characters, the ones who really make or break events were well portrayed. Kilrain the Irish yankee sgt and Armistead the rebel general are two excellent examples.<BR>   Yes the reenactors were too old and too fat but they forced the film makers to &quot;de-Hollywood&quot; in ways that brought greater authenticity to the movie. The scope of Pickett's charge was breathtaking and the pathos of those events were gripping. The comparisons to Ken Burns &quot;Civil War&quot; are also as unfortunate as they are inaccurate. 75% of Burns narratives were improperly paired with photos to achieve a dramatic rather than historically accurate depiction. Gettysburg is far more factual.<BR>   By all means see it, enjoy it, buy it. Then get &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; for the best film ever made on the WBTS.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|&quot;Das Boot&quot; stands as Wolfgang Petersen's best movie bar none. No movie he's directed before or since can match it in terms of the sheer scope and power of this claustrophobic war thriller. Set on a German sub during WWII, the crew's mission is to patrol the North Atlantic and destroy an Allied armada headed for Great Britan. Populated by new recruits and a sprinkling of veterans, the crew must fight for survival as they are bombarded by an enemy they can't see up above them.<br />This intense reissue of this classic movie finally comes to DVD in its original 5 hour German presentation for television.  The original presentation was as a mini-series for German television and, as such, the pacing and structure differ significantly in some areas. The languid pacing of the movie only adds to the tension (I say languid because compared to the brisker two hour plus version, the film moves along much, much slower). The longer takes and slower pacing adds dramatic tension particularly to the film's second half.<br />This edition ony has the featurette &quot;The Making of Das Boot: Behind the Scenes&quot; along with Columbia Tristar previews. If you own other versions of the movie, you may want to keep them for the extras not included here. On the other hand, if you own the Superbit edition of the Director's Cut, I'd suggest holding on to that as well. While the picture quality is very good throughout most of the movie, there are sections where the film clearly wasn't color corrected quite right and where there's a degradation of the picture quality. It's only slight but picky DVD fans will probably notice it immediately.<br />The sterling performances are highlighted by Jurgen Prochnow in his first widely seen (in America)role as the ship's beleaguered captain. All the cast give convincing and powerful performances. This edition is subtitled  in both English and French with the soundtrack available in both German and English in 5.1 remixes created from the original stereo master soundtrack. While these 5.1 mixes don't have quite the depth, clarity or volume of a film recorded and mixed for 5.1, the effect adds to the film. I personally preferred the original stereo soundtrack but that was just personal preference.<br />The widescreen presentation of 1.85:1 means that those of you without widescreen television sets won't have to gaze an image that's tiny. It's certainly smaller than full screen and, yes, it does have the black bars at the bottom and top of the frame. I'm a bit confused about this as I was under the impression that the film was shot full screen for German television (it was, after all, produced in 1985) and matted after the fact. Why Columbia chose to go with the widescreen look vs. full screen is a bit perplexing. I realize they're playing to the audience that has widescreen TV's and looking to the future and all that but it was shot in another aspect ratio to begin with.<br />Anyhow, great movie with a solid if flawed transfer, &quot;Das Boot&quot; is worth viewing in its full length version.al stereo master soundtrack.

6305603847|3.0|First off, let me say that this movie DOES have a plot. It shocks me that so many Pink Floyd fans would think that the movie is plotless. I would have thought that more Floyd fans would have either caught on or listened to other fans when they explain the plot. The movie is about a rock star named Pink who lost his father to the war while he was only a small child, dealt with an over protective mother all his life, had a failed marraige (mostly his own fault) and was also a rock star who abused the power he had over his audience, still a nice statement for the mindless sheep who follow a band blindly and become obsessed to the point of losing their own individuality. Pink began his career as a rock star to escape the every day Hell that he had to live with, one that haunted him for years.<br />That said, Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" was a ground breaking album and a step in rock and roll that HAD to be taken. A band like Pink Floyd had to exist so that they could inspire other bands (Tool and A Perfect Circle come to mind) to produce honest to God, good rock and roll with a heart and something real to say, rather then the mindless soulless corporate crap that clutters up the radio today. The character here builds up an emotional wall around him to guard his vulnerability, something that we've almost all been through at one point or another in our lives. Pink Floyd by all acounts were a revolutionary band, the first band to go the extra mile with their art and were wildly successful with it. Of course, this is just one reviewer's opinion, I've always understood a person's reason for not liking Pink Floyd. The band is not for everyone. Some don't want to be dragged along for over an hour, following a story with music. Some just want good tunes to blast in their car or headphones and that's understandable.<br />Down to the movie. It's more or less over an hour of music videos, before there were such a thing. The dialogue is the music which is more of a narration which couldturn some people off. I personally would have loved to see a real movie with real dialogue because everything about The Wall is theatric. From the album to the stage show. Here, the music is the film and the scenes are the background. Reverse the rolls and you would have one Hell of a movie, in my opinion. Which is not to say that this movie is without it's good points. For instance, \\"Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2\\" is a great point in the movie. The maze to represent a school is brilliant and so are the kids being lead into a meat grinder. A great social commentary on crooked education, with teachers that revel in taking out their own problems on the kids they're paid to teach. \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is also another high point. There's too many videos to run through, so I'll just say that they vary from being great (Goodbye Blue Sky, The Trial, When the Tigers Broke Free), to just being ok (Young Lust).<br />The real shining star of this movie is Gerald Scarfe. His animations are AMAZING. \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" is really the high point of the movie, hands down. The symbolism is great and on point and gets the point across beautifully, more so then the regular scenes with actual acting. \\"The Trial\\" is also everything it should have been and more. (The judge is a butt with a face on it. How true is that?)<br />All in all (no pun intended), you should get this if you're a real Pink Floyd fan, who hasn't just heard a few songs here and there on the radio. You should also buy this if you've read all the reviews on here and have a good grasp on what you'll be spending your money on. This film is not for everyone. This is the type of movie where if you don't get it, you'll most likely just watch it once and never again. Maybe twice if you're thinking that you missed something that you should be getting. And if you do get it, it's a great experience that you'll dig out every now and than for a fun time. As depressing as the movie is, there is much positivity that lies beneath the surface. So many of us have the emotional wall around us that we really do need to break down in order to enjoy life, love and all the other adventures that the world has instore for us. You have to dig beneath the surface with this movie like much of Pink Floyd's work to get the concept. If nothing else, you can enjoy the music as it sounds better on this DVD than the album. There's also two new songs. The bonus features are rather plentiful, featuring the original documentary on the movie, a two part retrospective, the music video for \\"Another Brick on the Wall pt. 2\\", the \\"Hey You\\" scene (which was cut from the movie because Roger Waters thought it dragged the flim on too much but is actually quite great), the trailer, a still gallery and commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe which is great and at times very funny. If nothing else, the bonus features may interest you.<br />If you'd rather experience The Wall in a different way and are interested in seeing just what the live shows for the album were like, I'd strongly suggest Roger Waters' \\"The Wall: Live in Berlin\\" DVD. It's a great DVD despite some stale guests here and there. A truly great thing to witness if you really love the album.<br />One love to all,<BR>Kevin
B000286RZM|5.0|Frusciante and long-time collaborator Josh Klinghoffer bring back the raw feel of early Frusciante work on this album.  While the songs are certainly more polished and refined than \\"Niandra La Des\\" or \\"Smile From the Streets\\", they seem to fit more along the lines of \\"To Record Only Water\\", being less produced than the songs on \\"Shadows\\".<br />As with all of John's albums, this one grows more pleasing with each play.  The intricate little details can't be heard immediately - it takes a little time to appreciate their efforts.  However, the payoff is worth it.  There are some real gems on this album, and it's really good all the way through (for established John fans).  The mood is dark, though, the lyrics don't always match that mood.  Really, this album is fantastic.<br />Highlights for me: A Loop, The Days Have Turned, The Will To Death.<br />For those who are not familiar with Frusciante's solo work - check out \\"To Record Only Water For Ten Days\\" first.  THEN, IF you enjoy that, buy this album.  Also, try the Brown Bunny Soundtrack.<br />For Fru Fans - feel safe in investing in John's latest masterpiece.  It's raw and beautiful.  Can't wait for the next one.
B000294SFW|5.0|If you like your tunes loud and fast then Inferno will be on your CD player's repeat-mode for about four months straight!  Excellent album, yet again, from veteran rockers Motorhead.  This is what Metallica should have been turning out for the last seven years, pure metal!  All tracks are blazing, it is difficult to pick out a favorite.  The closing \\"Whorehouse Blues\\" displays the one non-metal track, a grrooovy, dirty and very tasty blueser...Lemmy style.

B000001EHS|4.0|Def Leppard might not have been the prettiest of the 80s hairspray rockers, but they certainly made up for in sheer likeability.  Probably the biggest claim to fame Sheffield can make, Def Leppard wrote catchy, punchy, stadium filling anthems that you just had to wield your tennis racket to.<BR>Vault is biased to showcasing their two biggest selling albums, but it still makes for an impressive collection.  If all you ever heard from this bunch was Love Bites or Let's Get Rocked, this is the perfect opportunity to get a crash course.<BR>Pour Some Sugar On Me is sexy and sassy and in every strippers dance compilation.  <BR>Rocket is just so wonderfully perfect for a night on the tiles, showering people with beer while you manfully belt the lyrics.<BR>Hysteria may possibly never leave your head.  You'll be humming it while you're stuck on public transport, you'll wake up with it still on repeat in your brain.<BR>Oh I could go on, but I shan't.  Def purists seem to have a bit of bone of contention with the contents of Vault, but suffice to say, this album will get you very very interested in exploring the band's back catalogue, which is just as advisable as buying this.

B0000C7GG2|4.0|&quot;Absolution&quot;, the third studio album from the English rockers Muse, (14 tracks, 52 min.) is no great departure from their earlier albums, and I mean that as a compliment. The trio provides a wall-of-sound with heavy bass and drums, and scratching guitar riffs and solos all over, with the occasional pianos to add to the &quot;heavy metal emo&quot;. It works great. Best tunes include the opener &quot;Apocalypse Please&quot; which oozes urgency, both musically and in the lyrics (&quot;Declare This an Emergency...This is The End of the World&quot;), the current single &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot; (in heavy rotation on MTV2 and Fuse), but also &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; and the thundering &quot;Hysteria&quot;. And can we get over the Radiohead comparisons already? What does it matter whether these guys are or aren't like Radiohead era-&quot;The Bends&quot;? &quot;Absolution&quot; is an outstanding album, period, and should be enjoyed for what it is, nothing more, nothing less.<br />Muse are bone-fide stars in their home country of England and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere in Europe. They headline the massive UK open-air festival V2004 later this summer. To put that in contrast: about two months ago, Muse played Top Cat's here in Cincinnati, which holds about 200 people or so, give or take a few dozen (at least it was sold out!). True story. I still can't hardly believe it myself.

B00009TB5G|3.0|I have watched the first one, and much of the second one. I really wanted to like it because it is so respected. But I really don't get the appeal. Sure, the effects are great. But the story and the dialogue are as interesting as watching grass grow. If you know you are a fantasy or a Tolkien fan, go for it. Otherwise...
B000069KE0|4.0|This is Chicago's second album, released in 1970, originally a double (vinyl) album, and released now with historical perspective by the fine folks at Rhino (is there a better re-issue label around? and no, they didn't pay me to say that!).<br />&quot;Chicago&quot; (25 tracks, 73 min.) is best known for its 3 hit singles &quot;Make Me SMile&quot;, &quot;Colour My World&quot; (never understood why the British spelling was used) and &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;, but I enjoy some of the lesser-know tracks just as much, if not more. Take &quot;Poem for the People&quot; for example, with exquisite interplay by the horns, which in 1970 was still pretty novel for a rock band. The &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; suite (tracks 19-23, side D of the original album) is Chicago at its non-commercial, progressive best. This reissue comes with great liner notes (but not the lyrics) and the bonus single versions of &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; and &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;, which isn't really necessary but hey, it's a nice way to round out the 79 min. capacity of a single CD.<br />I have never seen Chicago in concert, and for a fleeting moment I was tempted to go see them recently here in Cincinnati on the double-header with Earth Wind &amp; Fire. Couldn't do it, for fear of disappointment. &quot;Live in Japan 1972&quot; is such an incredible live recording that I knew I would be disappointed.
B000002IZ4|5.0|This is the second album for the trippy 90's hard rock group. While STP was unfairly lumped in with the grunge-rockers of the era, STP was in reality a hard rock band, sounding straight out of say, 1975. All that with some grunge influnces, of course. This album includes some of the band's biggest hits, like 'Interstate Love Song', 'Big Empty', and 'Vasoline'. While not being as hard-drivingly heavy as the previous album, the band have not gone light. I love all of the songs on here. Scott's voice, I feel has matured a little bit, espescially on tracks like 'Big Empty', which gives a new meaning to the term 'power ballad'. Buy this album, it's a tried and true classic.

B00024BHTC|5.0|If you are familiar with Nightwish's previous work, you know they're terrific. But even the last multi-platinum album &quot;Century Child&quot; is small compared to &quot;Once&quot;. Tuomas Holopainen, the keyboardist of Nightwish and the composer of this incredible music, has done it once again, this time even better than ever before. This album is, from track #1 to track #11, sheer ear orgasm. Nothing's ever sounded like this. &quot;Once&quot; is a masterpiece that just blows your freaking skull out. Period.

B00003CXRP|5.0|Greeting comrads.  Whats all can be said. read Yugijouohs' stunning review here in this Amazon customer review section, and you can believe me, he be harsher than I would have been if i talk , but that's repeating, he has said all there is to say!  But I'll toss my 2 lira - Helen Hunt is the cats pajamas for ME personally--as opposed to me impersonally haha eddu make funny--and if had known she was not going to appear in Cast Away, I would not have even gone to see it.As mia santa momma said , flattery is no pizza,...but I will smash that rule here.  WHENEVER Ms. Hunt is on picture, the movie is EYECATCHING!  Again, see Yugijouohs review for more &quot;depth&quot;  , I only write to urge you, the last TWENTY minutes of this movie recall the label on minestrone soup cans when i was a boy- Mm Mm GOOD!  Probably the best use of digital storage in this crazy filmmaking world.  Happily, this is my first positive review on Amazon, and this kind of filmmaking must &quot;be a shining city on the hill&quot; like Ronald Reagan speech! I say, Stay away from bad foreign film, go see Hollywood..(you may learn english)! To say 1 negative thing, the scenery shots ARE boring &amp; Hanks seems a very disengenous man. To believe this movie was hardly &quot;test screened&quot;, I love that this type of movie ending is not what world &quot;wants&quot;(?) At most you cant turn your DVD off when Mr Hanks is rescued,the movie would get malto bazillioniano stars I give in the review.  This is my best advice.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril has topped her debut album with the release of her new album \\"Under My Skin\\". It is simply a great album from start to finish. I really love her voice. She along with Natalie LaRue & Plumb are the best female voices going today. The lyrics in the last track on the cd \\"Slipped Away\\", which was written for her Grandfather, who passed away are just beautiful. Also, songs like \\"How Does It Feel\\", \\"Nobody's Home\\", & \\"Fall To Pieces\\" are great ballads. Then songs like \\"Together\\", \\"Freak Out\\", \\"Take Me Away\\", & \\"My Happy Ending\\" are great rock songs. This is a must have cd for anyone who is fans of Avril, or even fans of artists like Plumb, Michelle Branch, Fefe Dobson, or even Pat Benatar. 5 out of 5! Keep up the good music Avril!!!
048622709X|2.0|This book is not for beginners. To understand this book you'll need to have a good understanding of the hand's anatomy, but if you already understand the hand then this book will be useless. Some pages are organized so on the left will be a description like &quot;the pinky sticks out at this angle&quot;, then on the right will be an ink blot test looking drawing where you can't even see the pinky. A good alternative to this is Burne Hogarth's &quot;Drawing Dynamic Hands&quot;.
0375707972|2.0|I found myself skimming through much of &quot;The Reader&quot; just to finish the book.<br />It was wrong of Hanna to take advantage of a young Michael.  That whole scene disgusted me.<br />The trial was dragged out and boring.<br />I didn't feel for any of the characters in this book.
B00024BHTC|5.0|They did it right. Give them an orchestra and you got &quot;Goth Metal&quot; done right. Give them an orchestra that won tops awards for Lord of the Rings and well...it's beyond anything in the Metal world. Metallica tired but they did not get how to do it. Other bands use small orchestras and keyboards to make it sound like there is one big orchestra. But Nightwish well they get a full on orchestra that  truns Goth Metal, Death Metal, Doom Metal, Black Metal, and all other kings of Metal on it's head. :)
B000068IEU|5.0|Last House On The Left shocked a hardened horror/exploitation fan like me. I couldn't believe that this was made in 1971. The sadistic way Krueg and company acted and how they tortured poor Mari and her friend was nothing short of vile, but the way Craven shot these scenes of torture made your stomach churn twice as bad. The revenge of the parents also made this film something to behold. Last House is classic exploitation. Viewing it is a must.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|First of all, I really think that reviewer &quot;the infidel&quot; is really stupid, Micheal jackson came out with thriller in 1982 and justin timberlake came out in 2002, so that's like 20 years, so how did he steal timberlake's moves? you're really living under a rock.<br />Anyways,thriller is an amazing album that pack a whole lot of variaty, from pop to rock to r&amp;b, till this day, it remains one of the best pop/rock records of all time, with classic songs like &quot;beat it&quot; &quot;billie jean&quot; and of course the most well known video song of all time &quot;thriller&quot;, this is A CAN NOT MISS record, Buy it now if you were young when the original copy came out.
B00006JDS4|4.0|This film may be regarded as sick, vile, and disturbing... which is exactly what it is in the minds of most. I enjoyed it. Its a film that wasn't afraid to take risks and show the public acts of extreme (...) on the silver screen. It had redeeming values for women as well. Even though it showed Keaton being raped and tortured, she got hers. A classic tale of revenge.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Let's see here - no, they are not classic rock, comparing them to classic rock is futile, as classic rock can mean anything from Black Sabbath to Pink Floyd. The similarities between AC/DC are apparent in the more upbeat tracks, but this band shows it has a lot more to offer than just upbeat music. They show an ability to write ballads as well, and believe it or not, naysayers, but some of the ballads are actually very good. From what I can tell, this band doesn't really know whether it wants to write fast rock tracks, ballads, or play more expiramentally, they show all three- &quot;Get What You Need&quot; sounds like something like the Beatles with the use of the background vocals. All in all, the album is very good for first listening, and then you'll find out which tracks to skip. But I still applaud them, the album doesn't have the same sound throughout, so it makes a lot more interesting. I just wish they would have made one of the ballads a single too, so people wouldn't be expecting an album full of &quot;...Be My Girl&quot; - they demonstrate they are capable of much, much more, with their use of harmony, and guitars. It does borrow from classic rock, and somehow it makes a sound that is different than those bands. I respect this band, and only see them as having great potential once they start writing better lyrics.
B00000K0DV|4.0|I dont know why this movie is bashed and made fun of. In my opinion, its classic italian horror. Its contraversial subject matter, and not to mention, overall violence make it something great. I wouldn't call it a basic slasher. It goes beyond that. Its psychological elements also show that it has something of a storyline (unlike most other italian gore epics). So what if the killer talks like a duck. It amused me, anyway...
B00013F38K|5.0|I agree with all that has been said in the reviews I've read above, even with Keith Sargent who is the only one to have given the set 3 stars (and thus drag down the composite rating). He is right about the mis-choices of the producers of the series. This is unfortunate and common in our consumer oriented and fashion chasing culture to make quick commercial judgments. Even Caine cannot ward off this Western abuse! But the product, the original show, far out-shines the clumsy re-packaging (which, incidentally is not completely mismanaged - it has some very fine features as well) - that I support a full 5 star rating. And I hope that the general enthusiasm shown in ALL the reviews prompts the producers of the DVD project to continue with the full series, as well as take to heart the comments given.
1573225517|5.0|My only complaint is that Hornby neglected to provide song lyrics for the character of Marie LaSalle. I have yet to come across a novel with decent song lyrics. Whether it's DeLillo's GREAT JONES STREET or Pynchon's LOT 49. I realize that lyrics aren't the reason for Rob's music addiction. (And thank God he's not a Dylan fan.) But all the same, it would've been interesting to have seen Hornby try his hand at it. Plus it would've fleshed out Marie LaSalle, who's something of a stick-figure anyway. (On the other hand, one of Marie's songs is called PATSY CLINE TIMES TWO. In other words, it's a tune about other tunes. And that's just the sort of &quot;entertainment about entertainment&quot; that drives me up the goddam wall.)<br />My fave bit is when Rob visits one of his old girlfriends and her husband: &quot;Jackie and Phil are the most boring people in the southeast of England, possibly because they've been married too long, and therefore have nothing to talk about, apart from how long they've been married.&quot; Jackie &amp; Phil then proceed to mouth the usual crushing banalities about &quot;working at a relationship&quot;.<br />At one point Rob says: &quot;What came first---the music or the misery? Did I listen to music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to music?&quot; <br />That conundrum couldn't help but remind me of Geoffrey O'Brien's conundrum in DREAMTIME: &quot;In the meantime, in his gloom, he listened to songs. He never quite knew whether his emotions gave character to the song, or the song to his emotions. If he had not heard The Zombies sing TELL HER NO, would he have imagined some such miniature music drama anyway---or had The Zombies simply invented a new mode of feeling? After a while it seemed that every song---every *good* song---defined an emotion which did not exist outside that song. No song could ever substitute for another. There was only one ANOTHER GIRL or PRETTY FLAMINGO or OOO, BABY BABY. Ultimately there could be a list of thousands of isolated emotions, like a seed catalog.&quot;
034544678X|5.0|Patricia McConnell has done a WONDERFUL thing for all pet owners... this book is not specifically about dog-training, but about how OUR behavior influences the behavior of our PETS.(That's US onthe &quot;other end of the leash&quot;). This is must have book, whether you live with dogs, cats, other pets or even interact with other humans!!!<br />What can I say but WOW! Fantastic! You have to read this book- you will laugh, cry, giggle and get that wonderful &quot;AHA!!! Now I know why...&quot;moment.<br />Buy this book!!!
B000148KK2|1.0|Has Diana's marriage to Elvis Costello caused this terrible songwriting to emerge from one of my favorite artists? This CD stinks, I agree with the other Diana fans that say she should stick to her jazz roots. I feel sorry for first time listeners that discover Diana with this CD, they'll never listen to her again. Buy her early releases and stay clear of this mess.<BR>If you're hungry for some new music, pick up Bond's new CD or mr.deviant's killer instrumental album &quot;Techno Obsession&quot;, but skip this!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|ok, i havent got the cd yet, but i've herd tracks. And, yea, they changed their style ALOT in my opinion, i saw the end of the duality video when i clicked on the channel in a hotel in michigan at 3am,,,i was so psyched that it was the knot. then i was like...woah...wuts this?sounds ... weak (...). but i've been listening to em more, and , i like the more melodicness, but i really want some harder old skool knot. but, they matured,and i love em so i have to accept it, the songs are good and everything,,,but its not slipknot anymore......in a way i feel like my childhood love that i've known since 6th grade just got raped,but ...yea....its alright.....i'll live
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's first CD only hinted at this young artists' true talent, which is revealed on the new CD &quot;Under My Skin&quot;...she can rock!I dig the harder sound and don't miss the pop radio friendly music at all. There's no filler here either, just one great song after the other. A great summer rock CD, no doubt. <BR>This is one of my favorite CDs out right now along with mr.deviant's &quot;Techno Obsession&quot; which is a mix of power rock and hard dance music for a killer instrumental CD! Both CDs are great!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|When I first heard her new single &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; it caught my attention then I heard her 2nd single &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; and I loved that song as well... so I came on here to hear some sound samples to see what else the cd had to offer out of those the songs that stuck out the most were track (1)&quot;Take Me Away&quot; and track (2)&quot;Together&quot; so I got the cd and my favorite songs from what I did not hear previously were track (9)&quot;Who Knows&quot; and track (10) &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;.  I really do enjoy this cd the other songs are good but it takes you a little bit to adjust to the style the rest of the songs will grow on you more as you play it.  and I now enjoy the whole cd... so if you like the songs I listed you will most likely like the rest of the cd.  And for all you who are saying oh she thinks shes punk or what not...No there is a reason she comes up under pop artists when you do the search and if you buy this looking for some punk type music you will be disappointed and you should know that it's going to be poppish because for one her previous album gives you an idea on what to expect and for 2 she comes up in the search under other pop artists and she is anti Britney Spears and Christina because though her music is of the pop genere she stays true to the way she is and doesn't dress like they do.  So with that I give this cd 4 stars do to the fact that I had to give the rest of the songs a few listens, but like I said I now enjoy the whole cd and listen to it often..So don't hesitate on picking this one up.
B00005JLWN|1.0|After reading the rave reviews of Equilibrium on Amazon I came very close to buying the DVD. Some reviewers have claimed it to be better than The Matrix. I was very much looking forward to watching it but decided to check it out on cable instead.  All I can say now is thank God I didn't buy it. I watched it just the other day and my roommate and I almost fell asleep. I like Christian Bale's acting and was surprided to see that I felt nothing for his character. (He was great in Empire of the Sun and American Psycho.)  I felt nothing for this entire movie!  The acting was dull, the story made no sense and the characters were cardboard cut-outs. There was no suspense, no intrigue, no excitement,  no NOTHING!   I now understand why this film came and went so quickly from theatres. It may not have gotten a strong marketing push probably because the studio knew they had a clunker on their hands and didn't want to waste any more money.  I seriously doubt marketing would have helped it.  <br />Maybe I was expecting too much because I was thinking it might be similar to the Matrix, which they borrowed heavily from for this train wreck. The look, the style of clothing and the gun fighting all lifted mainly from The Matrix. Heck even the movie posters and the DVD box design screams \\"LOOK AT ME! I'M A CHEAP KNOCK OFF OF THE MATRIX!\\"  Though I thought the Matrix was a great film, it had it's problems. It borrowed liberally from many sources but at least the Wachowski brothers managed to make it all work together.  <br />Equilibrium has an intriguing concept that just wasn't executed very well. All emotions are outlawed.  A drug called prozium is used to suppress all human emotions including happiness and anger.  The citizens of Libria all take the drug voluntarily. (Like that could really happen!) Those who don't and show emotion are called sense offenders.  They are dealt with by a police force called Clerics, who supposedly are highly trained in the art of kung fu and the artof keeping a serious face!  The funny part here is that one of the top Clerics (Taye Diggs) shows tons of emotion during the film. But it somehow goes unnoticed. Even Christian's character starts to show emotion and no one seems to care. He doesn't get taken away until he gets overwhelmed with emotions and literally runs through the street screaming. The head honcho of this police force shows anger and Christian's character doesn't even bat an eye.  I'm glad I saw it on cable because it's not even worth a rental in my book. Speaking of books read 1984 or check out that DVD if you want to read/see a decent story about a dystopian future.  Heck even Logan's Run is better than Equilibrium!
B000002KIE|4.0|First of all im a little tired of so called \\"punkers\\" who not only have no idea what they are talking about but also were not even born when the Sex Pistols were around.  The Sex Pistols are not the first punk band.  The Ramones, Richard Hell, Television, Suicide, The Dictators, and Patti Smith had all been around a while before Rotten wandered into McLaren's shop.  The Pistols even took their look from Richard Hell such as (torn clothing, razors, ect.)  Also neither Vicious or Matlock played the bass in this album instead it was played by Steve Jones after McLaren kicked original bassist Glen Matlock out (his image wasn't what McLaren wanted).<br />With that aside this was the Pistols first and last legit LP.  Never Mind the Bollocks features the Pistols good old fashioned simple rock mixed with angry lyrics.  While the Pistols are somewhat overated (a band built mostly on image) who can deny that this is a punk masterpiece with classic songs such as God Save the Queen and Anarchy in the U.K. Anyone who is modestly interested in the U.K. punk scene should definitly check this album out.
B00006G8G1|1.0|Rock in Rio had all the ingredients to be a classic concert DVD, perhaps one of the best ever.  There was 250,0000 loyal fans ready to sing along with every note. There was a behemoth stage and light show, a fantastic set list, and of course probably the most refined, polished and exciting hard rock/heavy metal band of all time.  But this DVD fails when you thought failure was impossible.  While the music is utterly fantastic, the editing, which apparently was done by band founder and bassist Steve Harris, destroyed the whole effort.  No camera shot appears on screen for more than what seems to be 1/100th of a second.  It is far easier to focus on the white lines on the highway while doing 120 MPH than it is to focus on what's happening during this concert.   At first it leaves you wishing you could see more of a Janick Gers or Dave Murray solo; it then gets frustrating because it won't stop switching; and finally your eyes get so tired of trying to see something that you get a headache.<br />It is even more frustrating because while the DVD is playing, you know that something great is going on here but you just cannot enjoy it.  The DVD is pretty much unwatchable.  I agonized through it and will never watch it again.  There is no doubt that Iron Maiden ought to pull out the tapes again and re-edit this concert.  All the ingredients are there for a classic DVD to enjoy over and over again.  Do it over and call it Rock In Rio Revised.  If not, Rock in Rio will stand forever as a lost opportunity.
B000002J0B|4.0|I absolutely love this.  The only reason why I give this album 4.5 starts instead of 5 is because the song &quot;The Crunge&quot; is fairly annoying.  Besides that, the album is amazing.  This album sees Led Zep take a turn from their heavy rock into other different styles.  This experimenting turns out to be very interesting indeed (except for &quot;The Crunge&quot;).
0316666343|3.0|Maybe if I wasn't a reader educated about rhetorical patterns, I would have enjoyed the novel more. So many people have recommended the book to me, and so I picked it up as part of my summer reading pile.<br />I read the reviews on the book and one person mentioned that it was in the voice of a fourteen year old. I thought to myself, awesome, this will be interesting, as I just completed a creative writing class, and we learned how it is important to maintain age and character in a first-person voice.<br />The writing in 'The Lovely Bones' is indeed beautiful, however, I cannot believe that the narrator is supposed to be an eighth grader. A fourteen-year-old's vernacular is not as developed as an adult. It would be more believable if the narrator was an adult instead. Also, even though Susie is in heaven and cannot do anything about what is going on on Earth, she can show some sort of emotion or reaction to the gravity of her loved one's problems. I almost feel like the first-person narration is a lazy way of covering up a writing faux-pas in which jumping from mind to mind is forbidden.<br />The complexity of the story was impressive though. But like I already mentioned, there were elements in the voice that could have been tightened up to make it much more rhetorically savvy.<br />Finally, the ending did not impress me.<br />I read the book rather fast, because I was intrigued by the uniqueness of the story, but after a while, I just wanted it to be over. It was a good book, but read it when you really have the time.
B000002UAR|5.0|In only thirty minutes or so of music, The Fab Four made the transition from mere geniuses to legends, cementing their status as one of the most (maybe even THE most) influental and creative bands of all time. And when you hear Revolver, there is no question as to why. It is one of the most diverse, experimental, entertaining, original, provocative, and musically competent albums of our time, spanning multidudes of styles, recording techniques, and lyrical themes.<BR>Frequently over the course of the album, the Beatles rekindle their early love for R&amp;B, on such spirited rockers as &quot;Taxman, &quot; &quot;Docter Robert,&quot; and &quot;And your Bird Can Sing.&quot; At other points, they experiment with orchestral violen ballads (&quot;Elenor Rigby&quot;). They delve into phsycadelia, with tracks like &quot;She Said She Said,&quot; &quot;Only Sleeping,&quot; and the absolutely stunning &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot; <BR>Seemingly for the fun of it, they mix horns, violens, and whole orchestras into songs. &quot;Only Sleeping&quot; features a bckwards guitar solo. &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; contains random snippits that are haphazardly mixed together, creating an excellent &quot;trippy&quot; environment for the song. &quot;Love you too&quot; features a sitar, played by George Harrison. The imagery of the songs is boosted by superb studio technique, and the employment of echo and fuzz bass, giving the songs a dreamy, but energetic quality. Revolver is a brilliant and experimental record that you have to hear to believe. Listen to it. Trust me, you'll love it.
B0000666DW|5.0|...Can express about mastodon's power and brutallity--not to mention the creepy/morbid vibe you can't help but, to feel while you listing to this amazing record. I never heard such  band before, none. If you want a simular sound to this well ? burnt by the sun,dep, along with a lil touch of archenemy. Well, Your not true metal unless you copy  mastodon's &quot;remission&quot; its a masterpiece.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I have no problems with the songs that are on this album. They're all favorites of mine, and I'm glad that they're all conveniently located on one CD. It's the songs that aren't on the record that I have a problem with. Where's &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever?&quot; What happened to &quot;Drive my Car?&quot; Who's idea was it to leave off &quot;Back in the USSR?&quot;<BR>And I wouldn't mind that so much if it wasn't for the fact that One is intended to be THE definatave, career spanning Beatles comp, topping the Red and Blue albums, and the epic &quot;Anthology&quot; series. And yet on this generous 80 minute disc, there are zero songs off of  Rubber Soul, a measly two off of Revolver, none off of Sgt. Pepper, and none off of the White Album. In other words, THE FOUR BEST BEATLES ALBUMS HAVE ZERO REPRISENTATION!!!!!!!!<BR>Ahem...<BR>Also, did poor old Johnny Lenon get screwed or what? I mean, I understand that the tracks here were selected by the three surviving Beatles, which saddly to not include John, so he didn't exactly have an opportunity to suggest one of his songs. But would it have killed them to throw in &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,&quot; or &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever?&quot; Maybe it's wishful thinking, but John was just as great as Paul George and Ringo. He deserves recognition.
032109333X|5.0|Bevington's Complete Works of Shakespeare is a priceless source for the writings of history's greatest author.  All of the plays, sonnets and poems are contained, plus extensive commentary.  An invaluable treasure for actors, producers, students, scholars, writers, and anyone else interested in Shakespeare.  The Bard's canon is presented in an easily read format.  Highly recommeded.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This CD is very awsome...if you are a hard core Slipknot fan this is a must buy..if you just started listening to Slipknot this is still a must buy...Great songs from great musicians...<BR>Every song on this album is amazing in their own ways.....
B000067CPX|3.0|By the Way see's the Chili Peppers mature into a full blown pop rock band but it remains a hit and miss affair. The album starts off with the fiery funk rock of &quot;By the way&quot; before mellowing out into beatlesque pop harmonies and light orchestration. Unfortunately the album never regains the same energy it began with. Of the 16 tracks some work very well such as &quot;The Zephyr song&quot; and the amazing closer &quot;Venice Queen&quot;. Others such as &quot;Cant Stop&quot; and &quot;Throw away your television&quot; are just downright annoying. Why does keidis insist on rhyming up to 8 lines in a row? Some of his lyrics are quite awful and really bring down the songs. By the way makes for a very good summer album, but not something i would take on a desert island.
0689859368|5.0|I am a 37 year old mother and love anything with wonderful imagination and here, the Spiderwick Chronicles, are all fantastic.  I have read each of them and actually I am kind of sorry the book will be done after the next book.  I could read more and more if possible.  Holly Black and Tony Diterlizzi are so creative.  I do not think that these books are just for children.  I recommend the series to all ages.  It is fast reading but really exciting.  I am sure many of you will enjoy them.  My little girl who is six, loves the series too.  Definetly pick these books up the next time you are shopping at a bookstore or if you are online looking for a new book to read.

B0001Z53AQ|2.0|Out Of 21 Tracks There Are Only 5 Tracks Worth Listening To. As Always Eminem Outshines The Rest Of The Group But The Others Dont Do Too Bad With Keeping Up, Proof Is Actually Kinda Sick But Members Like Bizarre Are Just Laughable. The 5 Decent Tracks Are: Git Up, How Come, 6 In The Morning, Good Die Young, And American Psycho 2.....The Other 16 Tracks Can Be Tossed. Dont Buy This CD Just Download Those 5 Songs.
B00024BHTC|4.0|First off, you have to like this style of music in order to like Nightwish.  If you are looking for Metallica, then buy Metallica.  Nightwish is NOT Metallica.<br />Secondly, the orchestrations and melodies are fantastic.  Multiple layers of keyboards overlay deep and heavy guitars, and with the singer's soaring voice, the mix is perfectly blended.  <br />I would say this album is 50 times better than the Century Child, and rates as one of their best works to date.
B0002234LS|2.0|Coming on the heels of Depp's Oscar nomination, this overwrought trifle was a real disappointment. No complaints about Depp's performance--although he is almost upstaged by the most annoying hairstyle since Keanu Reeves' in Prince of Pennsylvania. The real problem here is Stephen King's story-- a weak variation on Misery that might have worked as an hour-long episode on the old Alfred Hitchcock Presents but just seems absurd blown up into a mutli-million dollar feature.  <br />One giant plot hole spoils whatever crediblity the story might have had: With all the instant information retrieval available today via the Internet, why on earth does Depp spend half the movie trying to prove he published a story in a magazine just 10 years ago? Yeah, I know. It's only a movie--but it sure ain't much of one.
B000092Q4U|5.0|The first song I ever heard of Lamb of God's, I heard on MTV2's &quot;Headbanger's Ball&quot;. At that time, I didn't like real extreme music. I was a slave to the generic rock music that gets played on the radio all the time, but anyway, I eventually got into black metal, which led me into melodic death metal like In Flames and Children of Bodom and such, and now I like at least one band out of every extreme genre. My brother had liked extreme music for about 2 years at that time, and he had this CD. I'm going to Ozzfest this summer (finally), and LOG is going to be on it, so I gave 'em a listen. <br />The CD was awesome the first time I heard it. It usually take about 3 listens to a song before I can get used to them when they have any growling/sreeching type vocals. However, I loved Randy's voice the very first time I heard it. It's usually a deep, throaty growl, but he ocassionally will do a black metal-type screech. On LOG's first album, &quot;New American Gospel&quot;, he had a different vocal style, which I didn't think sounded as good as this one, and it was impossible to understand, even reading along in the booklet. But that's changed, and if you like this kind of music, you should probably adore the vocals.<br />The drumming on here isn't really AMAZING or anything, but Chris is a capable drummer and plays well. Lots of double bass (as to be expected) and some nice little fills, like the one before the breakdown in &quot;Ruin&quot;.<br />The bass blends in a lot so it's hard to identify, but it'll usually follow the guitars, and the guitars are amazing (which you will read about next), so the bass hauls as well.<br />And now, the guitars. I swear to God, LOG has some of the best guitarists I have ever heard. They mostly play heavy riffs, but that's all they have to play. I've heard that it took both guitarists hours and hours to get all their guitar parts down, and the effort is shown. The breakdowns are amazing, and there's not a bad riff here. Aspiringguitarists, no matter what kind of music you like, should pick up this album just to hear the guitars. They're that good.<br />The songs here are all heavy, but there is a slight (*SLIGHT*) hint of melody here and there, like in the beginning of &quot;Vigil&quot;. The lyrics are great, too, so don't worry about them being the only disappointing aspect here.<br />Now, I'm sure you can tell how much I love this album, and you should check it out for youself. After all, it was luck that got it the Album of the Year award in Revolver magazine...
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I've heard songs from Avril Lavigne before(i.e. sk8ter boi, complicated) but didn't have her &quot;Let Go&quot; cd. When I saw this in the store I knew I had to have it. It was worth every buck! my favorite songs on the cd are &quot;Take me Away&quot; &quot;Together&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; I don't like &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; that much. My mom wierdly likes this cd too. Anyway but this cd for some really cool music :)
B00004T9UF|4.0|Come on people, Eminem is a very talented rapper. Sure, there is profanity. But seriously, curse words have become a huge part of our language. Now, I am not saying its a good thing, because it isn't. However, kids curse in school all the time and little kids hear their parents fight, and I'm sure quite a few parents throw around some bad words. Sure, he may sing about drugs and killing, but I don't think that would have any effect on kids. As long as they are being raised right and are tought right from wrong, thats all that matters.When Eminem was talking about killing his wife in the song, he wasn't telling millions of people across the world to kill their spouses. Remember, its all about common sense.
B00026W82U|4.0|It must be tough to follow up a success such as &quot;Quiet is the New Loud&quot;, and many people feared that Kings of Convenience would be a one-off as the band members each got stuck into other projects - Erlend Øye went solo with an ambient project, and Eirik Glambæk Bøe concentrated on his studies (in psychology, I think). But here it is: The long awaited follow up. And it's a very pleasant listen.<br />This sort of subtle, acoustic music never really goes out of style. You could just as easily give this album to your mother or even grandmother and they'd probably enjoy it just as much as you do (yikes!). That doesn't much sound like a good recommendation for a pop record ... but it is. The crisp clean production and first-rate musicianship makes this a treat to listen to, even though the harmonies are the oldest in the book, but also probably the most immediately pleasing for exactly that reason. This time the duo invite a French female guest writer and vocalist Feist for some variation - which works really well.<br />Take Simon and Garfunkel - add a bit of jazzy stuff here and there and a bit more melancholy in some places, and you have a pretty good general idea of what this record has to offer. I don't understand, though, why some reviewers find this only mopey - but then again I am familiar with Erlend and Eiriks home town where the weather is always rainy. We do nothing but stare out of rainsplashed windows all year (well, almost). And I know that this is when you want something as soothing as this on your stereo: While you make a cup of hot tea and read the paper, or invite some close friends around for a quiet, home-cooked meal. But it's equally good to rest your sleepy head to on a sunny, lazy summer afternoon: &quot;Gold in the air of summer&quot;, indeed.<br />I'm also already waiting in anticipation for the Röyksopp dance remix of &quot;I'd rather dance&quot; - probably the catchiest uptempo tune on this record. (Röyksopp, can you hear me??)
6305081751|4.0|I think its pretty sad like he dies at the end.Me and my 3 other 11 year old friends watched this movie and we first couldn't look at his face because it looked so weird.And we thought he only had a mask on.But I like this film.His mum has a angry managment and takes drugs.Well but I still recomend this for all ages.
B000003TAL|5.0|anyone who's afraid of dissonance, white noise, distortion, and feedback needs to shut up because they honestly shouldn't be listening to sonic youth. this album is great. its classic! i mean, sure not every song is amazing but hey its one of the few CDs i own that i can listen to all the way through without skipping tracks.
B00008OLYN|4.0|When I first picked up this album, I was skeptical as to what was so different about it that all the reviews have been raving about. Word was that they dramatically changed their sound from the heavy-then-suddenly-soft sound they are known for to more of a 70's progressive rock (King Crimson or Camel would be good examples) approach. I feared this wasn't going to be another &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; or &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; which was a shame because those previous releases were some of Opeth's best. But has Opeth reached the limits of their musical genius? No, of course not....what kind of stupid question is that? This album is another example of what metal can be if artists are only willing to think outside the box. Highlights of this album include the opening track &quot;Windowpane&quot; and the beautiful yet sorrowful &quot;To Rid The Disease.&quot; The album finally comes to a sad conclusion with &quot;Ending Credits&quot; and &quot;Weakness&quot; as vocalist Mikael Akerfeldt finally speaks of ending his life of misery after a post-relationship depression which has made him lose all hope and spends his last days wallowing in bitterness and despair. Opeth's deliverance of acoustic and piano harmonies entwined with bleak post-tragedy lyrics make this a sensational album that all fans of metal, goth, progressive rock or even blues music would enjoy.
B000294SFW|5.0|Motorhead was one of the greatest heavy metal band ever,and without a doubt they're still kicking ASS!!!Lemmy Kilmister doesn't have a killer voice line like Halford or Dickinson, but he definitely got his ball!! What are you metal heads waitting for?BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Formed when they were only 13 years old, Muse have grown together into a potent, explosive band who deserve to be spoken of in a sentence without mention of Radiohead. After showing considerable growth on their first two albums, their talents finally explode in oppressive grandeur on \\"Absolution.\\" After a \\"We Will Rock You\\"-like intro, heavy piano pounding introduces the massive \\"Apocalypse Please\\", setting the tone for the remainder of the album. Everything Muse do on this album is wide-screen: dense guitars, wide-ranging topics in their smart lyric ideas, and a heavy, prog-like approach to their songs. While they frequently tear the speakers apart with heavy guitars and bass, Matt Bellamy never hesitates to write a soft song like \\"Sing for Absolution\\", or an epic piano ballad with \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\". This album is heavy and smart enough to set them apart from their contemporaries as a band of impressive skills and songwriting chops; their growth will be fun to chart in the coming years.
B00006RINF|1.0|Dont buy this CD.  Its over rated crap!  THe only thing that is good about this band is the lead singer is hot!
1592400876|5.0|I remember a long time ago seeing a headline in a paper that read &quot;Milk Drinkers Turning to Powder.&quot;  This is the kind of English that really sets off Lynne Truss.  I saw an interview with her on television, and while she had a sense of humor, and that is apparent from the book, she also had a very serious side, and I was sure that for certain grammatical errors she would not hesitate to shoot and leave!<br />The title of this book comes from the kind of problem that people can encounter in the difference between spoken language and written language.  Being a fan of poetry, I am very aware of the difference between spoken words and written words on the page, and what a difference simple intonations and voice changes can make.  Punctuation and spelling can make a big difference, too.  Is it here, or hear?  Here here!  or Hear! Hear!  There are lots of arguments for the need for correct grammar and punctuation, and there are lots of pieces in here that talk about the history and misuse in the past of punctuation in key times.<br />This is a very British book in many senses, and some of the American rules of grammar are different, but it is still fun to read and see what happens with the differences.  Truss has a dry wit and this comes through most of the time fairly well.  There were times I did laugh quite a bit, and times I copied things down to email to friends.<br />This is a fun book.  You won't want to leave it behind, eating or shooting.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Words can not describe how wonderful this album is - one incredible song after another,each one a gem ... buy this now!
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|I know Eminem outshines the rest of the group, so what? Listen to rest of these artists, they can all stand out and do their solo (except 4 Bizaare). Even Bizarre has improved himself since the last album, on this album he is on beat and actually has little flows going. Kon Artist's lyrical ability is definitely above normal rappers, Kuniva has also got better flow since the last album. Swifty got some new rhymes and stopped saying he is the &quot;instigator&quot;. Proof, the first D12 memeber to have his own solo album, has great great flow but I just don't like his voice and his style, still has great talent though. So anyone that thinks D12 is just a pull down for Eminem and Eminem just needed a group so he can look hard, they are entitled to their own opinions but these guys from D12 does have great talent and they mash well together with Eminem cuz their flow are similiar at points. So this CD is definitely worth your money rather than buyer the Pop-Rap that seems to be very popular right now.<br />Production: B+<BR>Lyrics: B+<BR>Delivery: A-<BR>Overall: B+
B0001AP12G|3.0|Ok, I'ma get dogged for this, I just know it but...<BR>yes, this album is flled w/ mature, intelligent, heartfelt, and meaningful lyrics, which save the future of hip-hop from fading oblivion, which is why most ppl love this album as much as they do, but I mean, c'mon...<br />As wonderful as the lyrics are, and as catchy as the beats are, one fact still remains as to why I dont like this album, and that is...<br />KANYE WEST COULDN'T FLOW IF HIS LIFE DEPENDED ON IT!!!<br />What's the use in this album having great lyrics, and great beats if the boy can't flow well over them?! He sounds terrible. He's just as bad as Diddy, JD, the Big Tymers and Master P. when it comes to flowing well over beats, but in this case, the situation is sticky. His music isn't crapola like the names I mentioned above, so it's harder not to dismiss him as just another idiot rapper. His music actually has purpose, and meaning, but damn...<BR>that shouldn't excuse him for sounding amatuerish and juvenile over beats. He needs to learn how to flow then, I will give him more credit as a rapper. And, oh yeah...<br />not only can he not flow well over his own music, but he sounds bad when he makes guess appearances on other ppl's songs, as well (i.e.Twista, Janet, Brandy, Dilalect People etc.). :(
B00005JMEW|5.0|this movie is very violent and has a very good storyline but WARNING-if you area romantic person who dosent reall care for action or gorey movies then stay away-OR iff your a hardcore Tarention kind of guy then youll prolly really enjoy this movie-it offers some really cool fighting and gore 9 the blood might be a littl exagereated ) anyways i also bealive that the plot and storyline is very weld brought up-makes u cant wait for the 2ed one-i really enjoyed this movie and i hope you do too-i hope u enjoyed my review...GREAT MOVIE
B00007JVBI|4.0|When I hear Chan Marshall's voice, I want to both shield her and rock out.  She carries this incredible frailty in her voice, in the tentative strokes of her fingers on strings or keys, that I feel compelled to stand in front of the onslaught.  It's a protective urge, but I'm also singing along.  This is, to me, the sort of music that begets a squeaky singalong as I trudge home from a long day.  It reminds me of the emotions I can often cast aside; it reminds me of our interconnectivity.<br />Maybe it's my own depressive tendencies revealed, but I find more in her less catchy tunes.  Songs like \\"Names\\" and \\"Good Woman\\" are breathtaking-simply because they are stark, simply because her voice cracks with the pain (and I don't believe it's an affectation).  It's just really honest stuff.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Some people dont like rapper eminem becouse he has dealt with crap in his life but he really came with a lot of talent.<BR>The CD came out in 5/23/2000<BR>His songs:<BR>Public service announcement- This is a great track even though it only lasts about 30 seconds many of eminems other cd's had come with this sort of introduction including the slimshady LP which came with another public service announcement, D12 in Devils night came with one too.<BR>KILL YOU- Different track much like the Real Slim Shady(one of eminems winning songs)A very jummmppy song and cruel to the people who dont he doesnt think good of, not a seriouse song.<BR>STAN: Features Dido a great female singer this song is about a teen who has something for eminem and he has to keep writing to try and get some attention.<BR>PAUL- Very short skit somewhat pointless<BR>Who Knew- Eminem never knen how far he was going to get or if he was going to move at all listen to this song!!<BR>STEVE BERMAN-Seriouse song bring out the fact that eminem doesnt care what everyone else thinks he is saying f the world f the presidents f everyone.<BR>THE REAL SLIM SHADY- MOre of a higher beat song and the guy is trying to say that hes so good everyones trying to imatate him the cloths the hair everything.<BR>                      Buy the cds and make judjements on the other songs that are on the marshall mathers LP. Songs also feature Dr.Dre, Xzibit, Dido, Snoop d-o double gg (snoop dogg)and many other rappers. I personally like this cd a lot along with many of other slim shady cd's.<BR>Cd's that i would also buy with this cd would be The Eminem Show,The Slimshady LP, Dr.Dre 2001,8 mile Soundtrack.<BR>        Give me a good rating. Eminems a good guy who might need a slight additude adjustment with his girlfrien kim. i think that everyone need to listen to this cd to get the full effect of eminem to get inside him and see everything he is thinking.
B00008YJH5|5.0|Surfer Rosa is so seminal that this meager review can do it no justice.  I'd be ashamed to provide a summary of this album; it's just so damn good.  Pixies were the band I wanted to be when I was 20, and Surfer Rosa is the album I wanted to make.  Hell, they still are; it still is.  It's flailing, emotional, hilarious even.  It's daring and open and certainly not akin to mainstream rock of its era.<br />How do I pick a gem on an album that's so great from start to finish?  I'm just not going to.  If you're a fan of rock, be it \\"indie\\" or arena, you should own this record.
B000002LRX|5.0|It's funny how sophomore albums like this and \\"Paul's Boutique\\" are considered to be commercial failures, yet in truth are musically a couple of the best of all time. This is easily Faith No More's best release, and probably one of the greatest of the alt-metal genre. \\"Land Of Sunshine\\" and \\"Midlife Crisis\\" are both heavy, excellent, and ahead of their time, and \\"Everything's Ruined\\", \\"Be Aggressive\\", and \\"A Small Victory\\" are near-perfect as well. One of my favorites is the dramatic \\"Jizzlobber\\", and I'm just impressed that a band in 1992 put that out. \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" is a nice closer too. Though \\"The Real Thing\\" is also great, and is their big album, any real fan of the band must hear and own this one. Nothing will rock your world like \\"Angel Dust\\".
006019250X|5.0|Read it, then you will understand the point of the story. This book is worth to read!!
0142000663|5.0|I read the reviews for this book when I was first given the assignment to read it.  Some were negative, but most were positive, so I went into reading the book with an open mind.  John Steinbeck is a skillful writer, and takes great care in putting his point across.<br />This novel was not just about the depression, and the families who moved west, it symbolized all of the groups in history who were looked down upon as less than human.<br />Though the symbolism is way out of control in this book, it shows you how careful Steinbeck is at writing.
B00008S2VG|3.0|This album is pretty good but of course is Madonna's way of provoking you.  It is not very danceable as were her earlier works but at the Re-Invention Tour which I saw this past Monday, everyone was dancing in their seats!  Madison Square Garden was TOTALLY SOLD OUT!  I thought that there were available seats open so that I could move to a better vantage but by the time the concert started, ALL seats were filled even the nose bleed sections!  Would love to see her again but all tickets for the NYC show are all sold out!<BR>Can't wait for her new album due out soon!
B0002234LS|2.0|Ok. Let's start by saying that I haven't read the book from Stephen King. However, I find it really hard to believe that King, a master of horror, wrote such a crappy book. And if the book itself is not crappy well.. believe you me,the movie is.<BR>First of all, let's talk about Depp's acting , the so praysed acting in this movie. The only thing he did was flinch, go &quot;hmmm&quot; all the time, and of course, the unreasonable jaw-thing ( I can't explain it elsehow).If that's good acting then maybe Ashton Cutcher shoud be given an oscar for his performance in Dude,Where Is My Car?<BR>Then the story ,apart from a few moments, is really boring, tiring, unreasonable, and ,most of all, difficult to understand.<BR>As I mentioned before the movie is not a total crap. There are a few (just, a few) good moments, but it's not worth buying the DVD for them.Rent it from a video club, and see it.<br />In a nutshell, don't buy this movie. If you do like Johny Depp, prefer &quot;Pirates of The Caribbean&quot;,now that's good acting!!!!<br />Sayonara!!!
B000148KK2|1.0|As so many other disappointed fans have expressed this is clearly Diana's poorest work. As someone who doesn't subscribe to the notion that everything an artist makes is gold, which in itself is shortsighted and ignorant, I have to say that this cd is poor in every way, songwriting, execution and vibrancy. I like her as an artist, I have enjoyed her other very very good cd's, but I also reserve the right as a fan to voice my opinion if something is amiss, and this new cd is. It simply isn't up to her standards, musically or vocally. Even seeing her in concert a few nights ago didn't help these poor songs. They went over with a thud, all slow and boring, no emotion, people leaving in droves halfway through the concert. That speaks volumes. What a letdown. For a far better listening pick up the superior cd's by these incredible jazz singers who completely outdo this horribly boring cd;<br />Dena DeRose - Love's Holiday<br />Cheryl Bentyne - Talk Of The Town<br />Tierney Sutton - Dancing In The Dark<br />All three is the above cd's are outstanding and I highly recommend them.<br />Also of note, this cd will not play in alot of cd players because of the data file at the start of the cd. So buyer beware for the poor music and the chance the cd may not play in certain players.
B000069AUI|3.0|Coldplay's second album &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head,&quot; was met with such critical reverence and audience worship that it's hard to take an objective look at it. But, two years later, it's finally at a point where we can try to do that. And I think if you listen to it now that all the hype has died down, you'll find that it's a good CD, but by no means a masterpiece.<br />The CD opens with the aptly titled &quot;Politik,&quot; a song that, to its credit, sets the tone for the rest of the album. This song is followed by an awesome four-song stretch: &quot;In My Place,&quot; &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face,&quot; &quot;The Scientist,&quot; and the omnipresent &quot;Clocks.&quot; However, somewhere around song 6, &quot;Daylight,&quot; the album starts to slip a little bit. The songs aren't quite as good, and there seems to be a little less passion in them. There are some good ones, such as &quot;Green Eyes&quot; and &quot;Amsterdam,&quot; but overall the second half is inferior to the first half.<br />This is a great CD to listen to when you're in a mellow mood, perhaps lounging in bed on a Sunday morning. However, it's probably not one that you can go back to often, as after a while it just starts to sound redundant. But it did do something good -- it made me start to truly appreciate softer music, and for that, I do appreciate it.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|After hearing my friends talking about Avril, I decided to check her out. I had this nasty feeling deep inside what kind of music I would hear, and while its not horrible, its 100% typical, standard Teen Rock. The Lyrics portrait her as downright simple and unable to express some more mature writing, and most of the songs are like a face in the crowd, something anyone else could do. However, Its not bad, so no personal thing against Avril, its just that she really cant make it anything unique. Its Accessible and wannabe Rock, but it works for its purpose and for the ones who are drawn towards her simple and easy attitude.<br />When it comes to hooks, most of the songs are more bothersome than really catchy. There is one real gem here, and thats &quot;Don`t Tell Me&quot;, which even grabbed me, a rather cynical listener towards the new generation of Music. The Lyrics are simple enough, but it builds up nicely, and the chorus is great and oh so adorable, and it just force you to listen to it again and again. <br />There is something that just doesnt work with the most of her music apart from Dont Tell Me. &quot;Take Me Away&quot; is just irritating, and where the hooks should have been, there is just a finger on the skip button. &quot;Together&quot; is a pain. The Vocals are more of a headache than catchy, whatever she might think. &quot;He Wasnt&quot; is just uninspired. &quot;How does it Feel&quot; doesnt work, and never gets on the road as many other rock ballads succeeds with. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; starts like millions of other teen rockers, and gets a thumb down from the beginning of. &quot;Nobody`s home&quot; is yet another clone, and you start to wonder why she cant write something original. The Riffs are irritating again. &quot;Forgotten&quot; Starts fresh, but it is just a false premonition, and the song becomes really irritating, much because her simple text becomes a pain to listen to. &quot;Who Knows&quot; does not work, if you are gonna use raw guitar riffs to hook the listener, you gotta do it right. Avril doesnt have a clue about this, she just cant get the feeling right. &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; sounds pretty much like any of the other songs, thats right. It just sound boring, and identical to all of her songs. Forgettable. &quot;Freak Out&quot; is another attempt for a rough sound, but it comes out as simple and more of a lame attempt to sound tougher than what she can do and be. Finally, the last song; &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, a ballad starting with a piano, but it just doesnt work. She almost got it, but something is missing.<br />No, No, No Avril. You are not tough, and its time to wake up and smell the coffee. Its time to pay respect to the old generation and learn, instead of trying to clone the new teenbased Rock Generation. God Knows we`ve had enough of it. There IS potential in her, but first of all she gotta learn to write texts, and she gotta decide what she want to do. If she wanna be a rocker, she gotta get rid of her current sound and go for something rougher, something with a more pure sound, where bass and drums are left UNTOUCHED. Editing and mixing drums and bass in an attempt to get a cool sound is in my opinion a big turnoff with music. Anything you start to mix and edit becomes false, and doesnt sound good at all(Take the hint, let the basics of sound be left alone). Raw Power is Real Power, and only on &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot; she gets a taste of it with the good Chorus.<br />I do not really recommend this album, but again, its not bad, its just so identical to dozens of other teenagerockers out there trying to make a point, and most of her songs are just uninteresting, bland and boring. Sorry Avril, you just arent cool, no matter how much you think so.
B00013RC9I|5.0|this cd which i bought from amazon allowed me to play it on my walkman, boom box, computer, etc.  This is a very great album Surfing on a Rocket and Run are two of my favorite tracks, a few other tracks are just music, but are just as lovely. I recomend you buy this AIR album, it's not like there other music which I liked about it.
B00007KWHP|5.0|From the opening notes of 'Roundabout' through the closing strains of 'Heart of The Sunrise', this is the first masterpiece by Yes.  Fragile marks the entrance of keyboard master Rick Wakeman, and was the band's breakthrough effort.  The first 2 albums missed the US charts, and 'The Yes Album' only managed #40 despite it's overall strength.  But 'Fragile' broke through, and placed #4, followed by 'Close To The Edge' at #3, 'Yessongs' at #12 and 'Tales from Topographic Oceans' at #6.  'Fragile' also marks the first of Roger Dean's far-out artwork, which would remain a Yes trademark for the next 5 albums.<br /><br />While all of the Yes albums from the early 70s (through 1975) are excellent, 'Fragile' stands a bit above.  'Close to the Edge', 'Tales from Topographic Oceans' and 'Relayer' are a bit less accessible (with all songs ranging from 9 minutes to 21+ minutes!).  And the songs are just a tick better overall than 'Yes Album'.  'Fragile' has a great mix of longer, complex songs like 'South Side of The Sky' and 'Heart Of The Sunrise' (not to mention 'Roundabout' at 8+ minutes), but these are balanced with more concise songs like 'Long Distance Runaround'.  It also spotlights the individual talents of the band members, each of whom contribute a solo piece.  Each of these songs is great, and they add to the overall sum of the parts.<br /><br />Skip the hits packages, and collections, go straight to  'Fragile'.  Then get 'Close to the Edge'.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I bought this cd and was pleasantly surprised.  I only bought it for Hey Mama and Where Is The Love and I love every single song on this cd.

B000055Y0X|5.0|There are excellent reviews here about this movie, most of them rate it highly, and rightly so. It is no accident that this DVD is on average (at the time of writing) around 4.5 stars. <BR>I must confess I did not know about Peter Sellers before watching this movie. I was recommended the movie by an `artsy' friend - you know, the type of guy that thinks Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made - so I wasn't expecting too much, knowing how these types prefer style over substance. <br />I was pleasantly surprised. This is the type of film anybody can enjoy, it's seriously funny. It will probably have more meaning if you are familiar with the Cold War and the arms race, but if you don't know too much about that, the extras are a great help. There is one extra that deals with the making of the film, and how at the time of its production there was some subtle opposition to its release. Subtle in that the Air force was unwilling to lend it's expertise in the design of the B-52 bomber used in the film, and there was fear that its release at the time of J.F.K's death might have been seen as unpatriotic.<br />Well that's all behind us now, and we don't have to worry about the bomb so we can enjoy it more as a comedy than as a political message presented as satire. I must say that Peter Sellers is a genius; I couldn't tell when I first watched it that he was playing three roles! There are so many funny parts in the film and I don't want to spoil it for you by mentioning any. George C. Scott is also excellent and has some very memorable lines. <br />A bonus for me was that there was a language soundtrack in five languages; German, Italian, French, Spanish and English (off course) plus there were subtitles in more languages which is great for anyone trying to learn a new language. <br />I would highly recommend this film to anyone who loves satire and who appreciates jokes that aren't always below the belt.
B000002WU9|5.0|Its good to know after all these years after the realease of this album people are continuing to cop and review this cd, its a great reasurrence to know that people arnt caught in this swarm of bs rap nowadays of crap. You seriously need to cop all the wu-albums you really wont be dissapointed. Welcome to those of you new to the wonderful world of Wu-Tang.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is the best cd ive heard in a while.  Its better than some of the crap we been hearing in rap.  We finally have a real rapper.  I didnt think it was going to be this good. I thought that &quot;Through the wire&quot; was too good and the rest of cd was going to be crap but when i listened to it i was amazed. There is a lot excellent song like &quot;Two Words&quot; and &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;<br />My top 5 songs<BR>1. Jesus Walks <BR>2. Two Words<BR>3. Through the Wire<BR>4. Family Business<BR>5. Never Let me down
B000294SFW|5.0|This here is another top notch LP for Motorhead. Personally, I put this up there with Overkill, Orgasmatron, Rock and Roll, Bastards, and We Are Motorhead. If these are among your faves from Motorhead through the years, buy this now. We're alike. Ive got all the Studio releases. This one presents a very cleanly produced sound for the boys, and it comes across as more pure, ferocious, and deadly as recent releases from bands less than half their age. After all Lemmy is pushin 60! Rock forever Lem! Nice acoustic blues to end it off with a fine closer. Best moneyshot since 1916 easily. Rock on!             \m/____\m/
B000005ALN|5.0|Masterfully done is a pretty good description of the quality of this album.Basically this album is cool as #@*!. Deep, smooth, and fresh from top to bottom. Not to mention he has THE best voice in the game today. \\"You Have Been Loved\\" and \\"Jesus to a Child\\" are beautiful tracks that are so simply intricate that most artist never come close to.The couple of disco tracks are made cool by Michael's exceptional voice. There are also some tight ass grooves like \\"Move On\\" and \\"Spinning Wheel\\". Plain and simple if you like great music and hearing a splendid voice GET IT.
B000000XB9|4.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival logged 15 Top 40 songs, so it's a bit of a stretch to label a compilation such as this as their &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot;.  In addition to the 15 charting songs, what we have are several b-sides that received considerable airplay.  I suppose those songs survived the gauntlet and were chosen as the most salable product to complement the a-side, but they aren't necessarily Creedence's best efforts, and this collection could be better had Fantasy Records taken the risk of putting together a 'very best' compilation instead, using their hearts rather than their heads.<br />That being said, it is hard to criticize most of the selections.  Creedence may have logged more number two songs than any other band (they never hit number one), registering five: 'Bad Moon Rising', 'Green River', 'Proud Mary', 'Lookin' Out My Back Door', and 'Travelin' Band'.  Other Top 10 hits for the band included 'Down On the Corner' (#3), 'Have You Ever Seen the Rain' (#8), 'Sweet Hitchhiker (#6), 'Up Around the Bend' (#4), and 'Who'll Stop the Rain' (#9).  All are obviously deserving of inclusion on the disc.<br />Two of Creedence's best songs, 'Suzie Q' (#11) and 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine' (#43) undoubtedly would have fared better on the charts except fans acquired the extended album versions.  Purchasers of this disc should be aware that while the entire 11 minute version of 'Grapevine' is included, only the single version of 'Suzie Q' appears.  You can certainly question the marketing logic of that one.<br />Other Top 40 songs of unquestioned merit include 'Fortunate Son' (#14) and 'Commotion' (#30).  After this, the choices get a little hairy.  Since 'Someday Never Comes' reached number 25 on the charts, I suppose it's inclusion was a given, and it does add a second selection from the weak 'Mardi Gras' LP.  But is this song comparable to 'Born On the Bayou' or 'Good Golly Miss Molly' from the 'Bayou Country' LP, which claims only one song on 'Chronicles' ('Proud Mary')?<br />Other questionable selections include the flip side of 'Lookin' Out My Back Door', the album closer for 'Cosmo's Factory', 'Long As I Can See the Light', and the flip side of 'Up Around the Bend', 'Run Through the Jungle'.  While 'Run Through the Jungle' received considerable airplay, does 'Long As I Can See the Light' compare with 'It Came Out of the Sky' or 'The Midnight Special'?  I've always enjoyed 'Hey Tonight', but that song also did not chart for Creedence, and may have been selected as a second nod to the weak 'Pendulum' LP.<br />Two selections I won't argue with are 'Lodi', which rose to only number 52 as a single, and 'I Put a Spell On You', which was a number 80 hit for the Alan Price Set in 1966, but never a hit for Creedence.  Both songs are excellent, and 'I Put a Spell On You' adds a second selection from the band's debut LP.<br />Creedence is one of those bands that did so much good work that it's hard to arrive at their 20 best songs.  Fantasy didn't do a bad job despite the above criticisms.  I've settled for compilations that I had similar complaints with, such as the Beach Boy's 'Made In USA' disc simply because I wasn't a big enough fan to make the effort to collect all their essential work.  So I can understand people opting for this compilation, but if you're a more serious CCR buff, you'll want to skip this collection and start compiling the 4 classic CD's Creedence produced: 'Creedence Clearwater Revival', 'Bayou Country', 'Green River', and 'Willy and the Poor Boys'. 'Mardi Gras' and 'Pendulum' are only necessary for completists.
0316666343|5.0|fast-paced story, few slower or boring parts, keeps you reading, emotional story of a young girl that was raped and murdered she goes to heaven and it tells of her families struggles without her. fictional mystery this book is sad, uplifting, surprizing, its always the opposite of what you think is going to happen. i would definetly recommend this book for any mature reader
B0000020C4|5.0|Hands-down the best recording ever made of this production.  Great music, BEST CAST.  Lea Salonga, who performs the most powerful and most captivating interpretation of Eponine, is more than enough reason to get this album.<br />If you can afford to get more than one, add the Complete Symphonic Recording to your collection.  This and that album make for the perfect Les Mis pair.
B0002234LS|3.0|Johnny Depp is always enjoyable in movies, but this movie was totally predictable after about 10-15 minutes.  I've dubbed this movie &quot;Fight Club&quot; Meets &quot;Monster&quot;.  It was a decent DVD rental for a Monday night, but not much more, although I purchased this DVD as a per-order, as I always do.  Its worth your time, but don't expect to be blown away... Anybody who has seen Fight Club will likely figure this movie out within the first 10 minutes, after which the movie loses most of its appeal.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Is Franz Ferdinand the savior of popular music?  No.  But neither are the 5000 other bands out there who have been described as such.  But I like FF upon first listen.  Make no mistakes, it is dance/pop with a nice early 80s feel to it.  Nothing more, nothing less.  But the music has great hooks and I find myself singing along.  The reviewer who described this as a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; hit close to the mark for me.  Definitely worth the $12.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|These guys may not be the most original, groundbreaking of bands but when they cook they cook!!!  \\" Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" is probably the most overexposed song on the planet along with The Black Eyed Peas \\"Let's Get It Started\\" but it is rather catchy. \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\" was the tune that got my attention and made me purchase this CD.  Could've done without the overly long power ballad in the middle of the CD.  These guys may be a hybrid of The Stones and AC/DC but is that all bad?  At least they're better than Oasis and other copycats of that pretentious ilk!!!
B00006WKY9|5.0|The closest thing I have ever had to a religious experience is listening to Ulrich Roth. Everyone that has ever listened to these first few Scorpions albums know that the band totally commercialized following Ulrich's departure and this is the last studio by the &quot;REAL&quot; Scorpions. I love Michael Schenker, but the time that Ulrich was in the band defined the Scorpions and Heavy metal in general to me. Ulrich is one of my gods and his name should be spoken in the same reverential tones as Hendrix, Clapton, and Page. Unfortunately they were all overplayed and Ulrich was never played in the US. If you have never heard the early Scorpions and like the pop commercial stuff they have done this may not be for you. If you like the older style of Jimi Hendrix, ala rainbow bridge and his more melodic compostions you will LOVE this album. BUY IT NOW!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Even better than her debut.  i usually don't go for remakes but her take on the medley &quot;If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By&quot; is breathtaking.  If you don't have your partner in the height of passion by track 11 then you've got some issues!!! The playing is also topnotch and the track by Alicia and Tony!Toni!Tone! shakes it up!!!
6305090564|1.0|Well, what can we say? absolutely one of the most painful movies we've ever watched! The plot was non-existent and the acting - oh my god! with a guy called 'Treat' I guess we should have guessed! it was cheesy line after cheesy line, rather than a &quot;fine wine&quot; he was more like a cheap bottle of Boone's Farm that made you want to hurl in the sink!<br />If you have to watch this, we recommend you have a drink or two (hell, drink the whole bottle!) at least to numb the pain! Oh yeah, and amazingly Treat's hair quif remains perfectly intact after being underwater and everyone else is drenched - oh dear.
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|Awful!  Julian Casablacas had the nerve to put the bad mouth on Jet and their music, you'd be better tending to your own house fella!!  Sold it back as used to record shop bought from!!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|You have to watch this movie without expecting it to go anywhere and then you might be able to appreciate the interesting cinematography and subtlties of expression in the actors. I didn't know that when I watched it and I kept waiting for something to happen. The movie is also hard on Bill Murray's character's wife--making it seem that she isn't justified in calling him and telling him he should be at home. He should be at home. His wife is right. He might be less depressed and lost if he went home, instead of staying away longer than he needs to and swooning over a girl half his age who is married to someone else. Speaking of Scarlett Johansson, her character comes on a business trip with her husband and then acts hurt that he's not spending more time with her. This movie caters to all the selfishness in people and makes it seem justifiable and right. Good camera work, though.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I, like many of you, also didn't receive a dvd booklet when I ordered my Gilmore Girls set. I later found out that if you contact Jose Roldan (from Warner Brothers) at jose.roldan@warnerbros.com and politely request one, you will be sent the booklet for free. This only applies if you bought the dvd set and are living in Canada. You have to send your name and address. I did it and I got mine in less than 2 weeks. Hopefully others are also as fortunate.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|In a time when the television is full of stupid &quot;reality&quot; shows, &quot;dating&quot; shows, Room decorating shows, or talk shows, a novel and innovative show was started and cancelled by the home of senseless cancellations.<P>Firefly is an intelligent take on both westerns and science fiction programs. There has been a serious lack of good science fiction on network television for years. The creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel worked on this projet with the creator of Fan Favorite the Tick. <P>Words can't do it justice, check it out, love it, show it to everyone you know.
B0000035GN|5.0|This actually is one of the best albums Sebadoh would release. The music and sound is totally laid-back compared to something like Bubble and Scrape or Smash your head on the Punk Rock. One reviewer said it was a &quot;subtle pop classic&quot; and that is the exact definition of the album itself. It's way more subtle and easier then other Sebadoh albums.<br />This actually had the first Sebadoh tune I've heard and this is the second last album I bought. The song was Skull and I heard it in the opener of the skateboarding video Anthology (by Transworld magazine). I liked the song at the beginning and thought it flowed really well with what was going on. I would later find out after about 2 years that it was from one of my favorite bands. <br />Even though this is way more relaxed then the other albums, it doesn't mean that Lou won't deliver some harsh (But cynical) lyrics and some pretty powerful songs. Tunes like Careful, License to confuse, Not a friend and Magnet's Coil all have a unique sound with some very, very good lyrics. Careful is almost devastating to hear but it's all so simple at the end. Not a Friend is something we all can relate too sometimes with friendships. License to Confuse is just 2 minutes of cynsism from Lou. Magnet's Coil isn't as harsh as most of the album, but the opening base line is extremely catchy. Then there's the easier songs with the easier sound. Skull, Got it, S Soup, Rebound, Dramamine and Together or Alone. Together or Alone just gives me a feeling of emptyness but it's a great song. Skull is the first song I heard from Sebadoh, great tune but nothing to crank. Rebound is just awesome. S Soup and Dramamine somehow connect within listens. <br />One song that sticks out though is Give Up. Starts off like a heavy metal track then goes right into the normal Sebadoh type ranting. It's my favorite track on the album next to Careful and Not a Friend.<br />Totally recommended for some great songs with even better lyrics. I wish Sebadoh were still around....
B000003TAB|5.0|During Nirvana's time in the spotlight (from Nevermind through Kurt's death), this was my favorite album of theirs.  I got into the band a bit later than other people, and would often raid my brother's collection to listen to this CD over and over.  It goes from dissonant rock songs to catchy pop songs and back again, and every song rules.  This CD is remarkably accessible, though there's still some people that just don't &quot;get it,&quot; thereby cementing its status as the ultimate rock record (even if it is a collection of songs, and not a proper album):  it's catchy enough that you'll love it, yet elitist enough that you can make fun of the people that hate it.  It's Nirvana's diamond in the rough.
1878424319|2.0|I have three words to sum up the book, WASTE OF MONEY! If you are desperately seeking help and guidance and can ignore all reason and logic you may enjoy the book, also you may want to seek professional psychological help. If you think critically or dislike someone imposing their outlandish beliefs on you then please don't waste your money.
B00000634J|5.0|Well i bought this cd about a month ago and it truly is amazing. the songs that really satnd out are IMAGINE, #9 DREAM, MOTHER, WORKING CLASS HERO,and GIVE PEACE A CHANCE
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Now, correct me if I'm wrong, this movie did originate from the book &quot;Big Fish&quot; by Daniel Wallace.  Yes, this is a likeable movie, but once you read the book, you'll realize not much is mentioned about Edward Bloom's ring cast into the river to get that catfish.  Read the book before you watch the movie if you want to know what &quot;Big Fish&quot; is about.  I've also noticed the part about conjoined sisters are different.  I don't want to ruin it for those who actually do want to see this.  The book and movie has the same purpose about the boy wanting to know about his real father, but the stories are totally different from each other.
0618526412|4.0|I read this book in one sitting. Oprah made a good choice. The heart is a lonely hunter and the story teaches not to see through people beacause you never know who you could meet. A deaf mute could be one of the best people to know in the world. You never know what he has been through in his life.
B00004TL21|5.0|Beautiful in its dark, gloomy dissonance, the songs on White Pony combine Chino Moreno's haunting melodies crooning over churning guitar riffs which are overlayed by moody textures provided by Frank Delgado's turntables to create atmospheric hard rock unlike anything ever heard -- or felt -- before. The songs could easily follow in the like of Pink Floyd while still living up to the mosh-pit insanity that inspired 1995's Adrenaline, and each song is powerful enough to drive the listener into emotional overhaul as he bangs his head to the cymbol-laced &quot;caffiene beats&quot; of drummer Abe Cunningham. Digital Bath is outlined with moody background electronics and an infectious drum intro before being taken over by a call-and-response guitar riffs and incredible melodies from the likes of Moreno. Rx Queen is another electronic-laced track with a massive percussive effect traced by intricately layered guitars and whispered vocals. Street Carp is a simple, straightforward hard rock smash in the vein of Around the Fur's Lhabia and songs such as Elite and Korea are massive in their bombastic heaviness with chunky riffs and fast-paced rushing. Passenger strings together a dextreous guitar riff, heavy bass, and shrouded vocal interplay between Chino and guest Maynard (Tool, A Perfect Circle). However, the album's glory shines through the most in Change and Knife Prty, two songs that show the newest side of Deftones, while keeping the Deftones heaviness we've all come to love. Atmospheric and moody, they send chills down your spine unlike anything else you've ever heard. <br />Overall, this album is Deftones' most experimental album that pushes the &quot;boundaries&quot; of rock beyond anything done before. DJ Frank Delgado, who appeared on a few songs on Adrenaline and most of the songs on Around the Fur, really makes his presence known on this album in an extremely subtle way. One of the greatest things about this album is that none of the songs sound the same. From thedowntuned, crunching glory and screaming grungy vocals of Elite, to the acoustic-string sampler Teenager, and EVERYTHING in between, White Pony never fails to deliver. The only way to describe every track is atmospheric and dark. It's heavy, but it is also beautiful.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I think it's funny that people are reviewing a box set they haven't even seen yet. How do you know the picture quality is bad.  <br />One of you reviewers said that you watch both the regular and the extended cut of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. That's impossible since the extended cut for ROTK isn't even out yet. You people bash Lucas for altering things, since he had to right to change things. Yet, Jackson changed MANY things for his movies. He let out entire scenes and people (Bombadil). Heck, he even ended Two Towers partway through the novel and started ROTK with scenes from Two Towers. <br />So let's wait for the finished product before we decide to review it
B000001Y5J|5.0|beautiful work done by Trent Reznor and his wonderful band . Nine Nails dont have gothic fans they also have fans just like me . <BR>my first nine inch nails would be Broken . a wicked album filled with amazement . the song represent something that we have within us and that we belive and not belive in . <BR>cant wait till mr.reznor puts out another good nin album <BR>i would be excepting his wonderful work of art
B00004RF9I|5.0|&quot;I'm mad as hell...and I can't take it anymore.&quot; Those words out of this movie will live on for a long long time. <br />It captures the essence of TV sensationalism gone mad. The movie was before its time, because many of the trends it suggested are present in today's ridiculous shows like &quot;Fear Factor&quot; and many of the other absurd reality shows...and of course, the worst of the worst is Jerry Springer...a show that capitalizes on people's tragic lives and unhappiness.  Anything for ratings, right??<br />&quot;Network&quot; has a lot to say and more people need to experience what the movie is really trying to get across.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|i have seen the broadway play, and have also read the book. when i came back from seeing the show, i had to buy the soundtrack. i was obsessed. i was played the cd for my friend, and she loved it too. pretty soon i had all my friends hooked, most of whom have no interest in theatre. the soundtrack is enjoyable for people of all ages, and i would highly recomend it.
B000007ODL|4.0|Bought this album as I like the Texas singers/songwriters and this was recommended to me.  The first time I heard the album, I thought it was okay, but after subsequent listenings, the songs have grown on me and I find myself playing it more and more.  Like one of the other reviewers said, its a great album to have on while you are doing things, like grilling out, working on the car, etc.  Nice bluesy, laidback record.  Smoooooth guitar playing.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I will never buy this lousy excuse for a DVD collection.  The Lucas camp says that Star Wars is his vision and he can change it if he wants to.  I disagree!  From the time the first three films were made they belonged to our culture in their original form. The creation of  the \\"Special Editions\\" is complete infanticide.  To make Han shoot second, and above the table wipes away the opportunity for a powerful character transformation. That transformation the character of Han one of the most enduring of the trilogy.  Even my 2 year old knows that HAN SHOT FIRST! Hey while we're at it why don't we go back and erase the scar on Indiana Jones' chin?<br />Let's not even get into the fact that Carrie Fisher, whom I think is great, is the only actor participating in the commentary.  I'm sorry but the Lord of the Rings Special Editions set the bar and even with Lucas on Chewie's shoulders he doesn't get close.
B000002MU3|4.0|After the two megahit albums OUT OF TIME and AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE,R.E.M.'s MONSTER wasn't even nominated for a Grammy. Hits from the album include WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY KENNETH? and BANG AND BLAME. Minor hits,those that didn't make it to the Top 20,are STAR 69 and STRANGE CURRENCIES. Cool album,though.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Iron Maiden is one of my favorite bands, however, this is by far not one of their best.  I'm glad Bruce Dickinson is back, but I saw Blaze in San Antonio and thought the songs they did from that album more interesting and concert worthy.  Iron Maiden has a great history, but this release is average.  AGE OF INNOCENCE is a good song for the times and based more on reality than fantasy.  The rest of the album does not flow quite as well and may require the listener to be patient to the new, slower Maiden style and repetitive choruses.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out, i thought it was a great cd, stronger being one of my favorite songs, u cant go wrong with buying this album, i trully recomend it, go buy it if you havent its worth the money.
B00005AQGH|5.0|1.)Intro bomb first (my second reply) (featuring e.d.i &amp; young noble) 10/10 This was a diss to anyone 2pac doesn't like at the time. <BR>2.)Hail Mary (featuring The Outlawz) 10/10 a cold beat that if any rapper rap to it they would sound good. And Pac had great verses. Eminem, 50 cent, and Busta Rhymes redid this song to diss Ja Rule. <BR>3.)Toss it Up 9/10 the chrous is very good, this is a song more for the ending. except at the ending when he disses Dr.Dre. <BR>4.)To Live &amp; Die in LA (featuring Val Young) 10/10 2pac mostly talks about LA. <BR>5.)Blasphemy 10/10 2pac talks about alot of things in this song. His father, Malcome X, Heaven and more. <BR>6.)Life of an Outlaw (featuring The Outlawz) 8/10 They talk about living as an Outlaw and what you go through as one. <BR>7.)Just Like Daddy (featuring Outlawz) 9/10 This is for the ladies too, they talk about what they will do for a women. Saying it's ok for their girl to call them daddy. <BR>8.)Krazy (featuring somebody???) 10/10 one of my favorite songs on here, 2pac tells about how messed up things are for him. So he feels crazy, you have to listen to it. <BR>9.)White Man's World  9/10 2pac tells how you should think if your a young black boy (like me) in this white man's world. <BR>10.)Me &amp; My GirlFriend 9/10 It is like two crimnal couples getting away from the law. You do know Jay-Z redid this song, but I like Pac's more. <BR>11.)Hold Ya Head (Featuring Tyrone Wrice) 9/10 2pac and Tyrone tell ya got to keep your head up. Even through the worst of situations. <BR>12.)Against All Odds 10/10 2pac disses alot of people on here Dr. Dre, Mobb Deep, Nas, P. Diddy, but that's just some of them. 50 cent redid some of this song to diss Ja on that Hail Mary song he did with Eminem and Busta Rhymes. <br />You know you have a good album when alot of your songs were redone by other rappers. 2pac had alot of problems he oculd have walked out of but didn't. And he did act crazy and scared most of America but not meI was 8 at the time. But 2pac has very good talent many rappers wish they had. 2pac can never be replaced he has done so much, he still has at least more than 100 songs left over. At least, R I P 2pac.
B0000648WZ|2.0|For a movie that represents itself as portraying the elite soldiers of the future, it turns out to be a monument to poor military strategy.  Considering that the enemy is an army of tank-sized insects, it seems strange that the human military's primary weapon of choice is screaming co-eds with machine guns.  In fighting the armored-plated beasts, there is no artillary or armored vehicles of any kind.  If they even had a few present-day tanks, it would improve their chances a lot.  In the movie, there's one brief scene of a bombing run by some ground-based fighters which turns out to be really useful, so it's surprising and even stuporific that they abandon the tactic.  For the remaining battles of the movie, they revert to running and screaming.<br />Looking at the technology of the Starship Troopers world, they have interstellar travel, but their ships are just glorified space taxis.  They never bombard the planet before the invasion, and when the insects retaliate, they don't fire back.  They just explode.  Great.  Also, they have fully articulate robotic limbs in this movie, but it nevers occured to the generals of Starship Troopers to create some kind of robotic exterminator to clear out invasion spots before the humans land, especially since the depletion of the human population is one of the themes of this movie.<br />Even if you weren't bothered by the military incompetence displayed, you should be troubled by the Fascist military government that rules this future Earth.  In this world, people do not gain citizenship unless they serve in the military.  Those who don't serve aren't citizens.  The director treats this change in society lightly, so it has a really creepy feel.  If you want to see a war movie, there are lots of other better choices.  If you want to see giant bugs killing people who aren't sensible enough to at least ride in a tank, then you don't have much choice.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I LOVE this cd! The music that John Williams wrote for the 3rd episode of the Harry Potter series is superior to the scores for the last 2 pics. As somebody has mentioned, I absolutely adore the children's chorus! On the whole, there's much variety in imagination in the music, with many new themes coming through this time round. The music is very well performed by the orchestra.<br />This is an outstanding soundtrack recording.
B000002H97|5.0|If you ask anyone interested in the realms of rock and roll, what they think about Metallica, it's most certainly going to come back to this album. Already one of the hottest bands in rock history, Metallica made it's name with ...And Justice for All and Master of Puppets, but where they solidified their taste value and made their name a household thing...is this one.<br />Everyone knows 'Enter Sandman', with it's catchy chorus, the memorable lyrics, and insane imagery. Everyone also remembers the beautiful 'Nothing Else Matters', the rock ballad that started anything METAL TO SOFT today. Then there's 'Unforgiven', the lyrically genius aftermath that spells success in Metallica's roots. I mean, everything is here. This is the album where you sit down and say, alright, Metallica can do this. This is also the album most radio stations play, just look at the tracks. This album is prolific.<br />Although fading very much so today, the band can be traced back to their classics...and this is one of them. Much like Nirvana's Nevermind, Metallica's self titled album paved many roads for modern rock today. If you ask me, this is probably one of the most necessary albums to have in your collection. Even if you don't like Metallica, you'll like this. I know mother's, my drummer's mother to be exact, who to this day, listen to this album. If that doesn't tell you about the wide spectrum of people this accompanies, then I don't know what will. While not a major fan of the band, I can safely say after listening, I didn't rush and buy everything else, but I still pop it in every once and awhile.
B0000A5A0T|4.0|The music on this cd has made it one of the top jazz records of all time and that, of course, hasn't changed. But a bad mastering job can change the listenabilty of an album and that has occured here. I have a few of the &quot;Rudy Van Gelder&quot; editions and the sound generally is not fairing well. The cds are often quite tinny and lacking in the bass frequency.<br />From the pre-Impulse years, this cd and &quot;Giant Steps&quot; are arguably Coltrane's best as a leader. The compositions on &quot;Blue Train&quot; are great and his solos fantastic. It's the begining of a new harmonic language Coltrane was exploring, culminating with &quot;Giants Steps&quot; and then disintegrating into the more modal Impulse years.<br />Buy &quot;Blue Train&quot; for the music and hope Blue Note gets the sound right next time around.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|the most overlooked of cds in the world, Avenged Sevenfold's waking the fallen is the best cd ever.  there are many good legendary artists out there like led zeppelin, queen, hendrix, clapton, the beatles, the rolling stones, the who, the doors.........all of them are classic and highly regarded as the best bands ever, but with the talent Avenged sevenfold has at around age 19 with Waking the Fallen, they are amond the best and still have room to grow.  amazing guitar riffs, heartfelt vocals, and amazing piano all grace the (anywhere from hardcore to melodic or both) songs on this cd.  every song is excellent...the song that got me into them was Chapter four which was featured in madden 2004.  The top 5, if i had to narrow it down, in no particular order, would be Remenissions, Eternal rest, And all things will end, I wont see you tonight (1 and 2...they are an epic as one), and desecrate through reverence.  but dont just judge by me because every song is amazing on this cd.  there is no other band on this world quite like them--they sound anywhere from punk to metal, emo to alternative, thrash to hardcore....all mixed together.  also try their first cd, sounding the seventh trumpet, which was in other ways even more experimental, throwing in some pop with &quot;warmness on the soul&quot; and some almost skate punk sounding in &quot;streets.&quot;  if you like them try Atreyu, with amazing guitar riffs, dualing vocals, and screaming.  they are the closest band to a7x.  trust me on this one and give Waking the Fallen a try.  It's an experience you will never forget.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil has a bit of every superhero mixed in, and has made an all-powerful superhero. Or perhaps not! Technically, in my opinion, it should be DaredevilMAN (Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc), but they probably thought that was too complex for people to understand.<br />Ben Affleck is really good in this, and he plays the part of a blind guy perfectly! I was a bit sceptical about this, as I wasn't sure it would look right, but by the looks of it, he had contacts in, making him look like he had cataracts or something!<br />Although, he can actually &quot;see&quot; particularly if it's raining, which was kinda weird. The whole scenes where he &quot;sees&quot;, is really very much like the scenes where Keanu Reeves gets blinded in Matrix Revolutions by the nasty guy, and he sees shapes in the fire etc. Well, these scenes are quite similar, although more blue, and nicer.<br />I really Jennifer Garner as a character, although her whole storyline was dropped at one point, for a very good reason. But at the end, it almost seems like she was still around, if you get my drift. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what I mean!)<br />I didn't like Michael Clarke Duncan as the bad guy in this. After seeing him in movies such as The Green Mile and Armageddon, and others which I forget, he always plays the good guy. He's the big friendly giant, and I just keep seeing him as John Coffey! Everyone knows Michael Clarke Duncan is a bad guy, but he apparently had to gain an additional 40lbs, on top of his usual weight, which would make him pretty heavy! (It doesn't really show, as he looks bigger in Armageddon &amp; The Green Mile)<br />I wasn't sure about Colin Farrell being in this movie. Personally, I don't like the guy, but I'm sure it's the way he's portrayed in the press: doing god-knows-what with Britney Spears,  drinking , smoking, all the things that I find a turn off in a guy. I'm sure he's a perfectly nice guy however. But oh my God, sure he didn't have a lot of lines to learn, but this has to be the first movie I've actually heard him SPEAK in! I've seen trailers for Phone Booth, and believe it or not, all you non-believers out there, the guy is not an American, but he's from Ireland. And he speaks in the most gorgeous 'Orish' accent ever! Shame he didn't have more lines to say, cos I could have listened to him talk all day!<br />If you look closely, you'll see a very surprising person making a cameo! The one and only Kevin Smith! I thought it was him, but he looked different. I think his beard was a lot more trimmed!<br />There's a lot of braille used in the movie, due to the fact that Matt Murdoch is actually blind. The start credits use lights from the skyline to form braille, and then spell out the actors names. Also interesting, the necklace at the end of the movie, also spells out Elektra in braille.<br />Most of the extras look quite good, and I was pleased to finally see the the entire video for Evanescence's &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;. (This was the song that brought them to the attention of the music industry, but another song of theirs &quot;My Immortal&quot;, is used during a funeral scene, adding a whole other dimension to the song. It's one of my faves of their songs, and seeing it played at a funeral scene, is really creepy - the lyrics totally match.) The rest of the extras look good, but basically, you need a chance to actually sit down and view them all. The extras include: audio commentary by director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster; &quot;Beyond Hell's Kitchen: Making Daredevil&quot; documentary with optional enhanced viewing mode; Jennifer Garner screen test; 6 multi-angle scene studies; Kingpin featurette; HBO First Look special; &quot;Moving Through Space: A Day with Tom Sullivan&quot;; 3 music videos: &quot;Won't Back Down&quot; by Fuel, &quot;For You&quot; by the Calling, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; by Evanescence; still gallery; &quot;Men Without Fear: Creating Daredevil&quot;documentary; and &quot;Shadow World Tour&quot;: an in-depth look at &quot;Daredevil's sight&quot;. On the back of the DVD, it is mentioned that there is a gag-reel, but it's not obviously included as a separate extra - it's probably in amongst the extras that I skipped!<br />This is a great DVD, and will be a welcome addition to anyone's collection.documentary; and &quot;Shadow World Tour&quot;: an in-depth look at &quot;Daredevil's sight&quot;.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I didnt know what kind of movie i was getting into when i first watched LIT, little did i know when i placed the dvd into my dvd player i was about to be immersed into a beautiful film. I cannot honestly say how much i thouroughly enjoyed this film, it truly immerses you into this mans life who has at one time been perfect, he was a huge movie star but now in his mind anyway he has almost hit rock bottom. He has gone from making feature films in the 70's to starring in a campaign add for liquor in Tokyo. Basically he is going  through a midlife crisis thousands of miles away from home. Bill Murray puts on a oscar winning performance and Scarlett Johansson lights up the screen with her supberb acting and her beautiful face and smile. This is one of those films you will either really love or really hate, i happened to think it was one of the best made and most tear inducing films i have seen in my 21 years.It is a unbeleivably well made and beautiful film, the city of tokyo is beathtaking and you truly feel that these characters are in a foreign land. It is a must see and definately a must buy, more films should take notice and see what a truly beautiful film really looks and sounds like.
B0000844IT|1.0|This by far is the worst film I have ever seen. Sure, I've had my fair share of bad films, but this one tops them off. The acting stunk in a very big way. I expected this film to scare the socks off of me, but, instead I was shaking my head in full on disgust at the Comedy Relief Film instead of being a true horror flick. Don't waste a second of your time on this film and don't waste your money on it either.
B0002234LS|3.0|Had to see SECRET WINDOW just to see what Johnny Depp would do with what was bound to be a predictable plot, and I wasn't disappointed in his turn as a Stephen King character.  Depp delivers with his trademark attractive quirkiness, but, you know, I really didn't quite believe him as his character evolved.  John Turturro's John Shooter from Mississippi was too obvious a caricature (offensive, really), thus robbing the plot of credence---and I have to say that the other characters were likable but seemed remarkably dim and/or overplayed.  Thus, I don't think the film works very well, despite being beautifully shot, but it does evoke dread here and there.  Definitely worth seeing, but don't get your hopes up.
B0000214F1|5.0|Yes, aside from the actual sex portrayed in this movie, almost everyone has an inexplicably visible rear end, and it features two enormous obscene wedding cakes and a giant phallic hat. But that is all so secondary to the point it's not even funny, just as in Clockwork Orange.<br />It's a psychological drama and a classic tragedy, and I'm not just saying that to seem hip by trying to elevate something obviously crass. The key point in this movie is that Caligula is not insane. His father, Tiberius, does seem to have gone insane from syphilis or something similiar, with those blotches on his face, but all of Caligula's behavior is intentional, as when he baits the senate and someone accusses him of being mad; he answer something like 'I know what I'm doing. I just don't know what _else_ I can do to provoke them.' All of his behavior is psychologically realistic, and that's what makes the movie so interesting, in light of how absurd and grotesque his behavior is. It does more than explain him; it almost succeeds in making him sympathetic. As for these charges of pornography, I don't think I've ever been _less_ turned on by a movie. The images are presented in such a way that there's really nothing pornographic about them. I mean, some people might theoretically be aroused by the sight of a guy fondling the naked body of his dead sister, but I think most people would instead see it for the extremely _disturbing_ image it was meant to be.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is a awesome DVD not only for the concerts, the sound it's powerful !!!, it's a real gift for the hardcore fans of Zep. Definitively one of the greatest bands all times, if don't the best. I hope to see more concerts of them.    This double-DVD set includes over five hours of never-before-available concert and performance footage from Led Zeppelin spanning the years 1969 to 1979. While enthusiasts have been trading poor quality versions of this material for years, this marks the first archival video release to contain any footage of the band playing live. The main feature on the first disc includes highlights of the band's legendary set at the Royal Albert Hall on January 09, 1970. If there was ever any doubt to the power and intricate legerdemain of Jimmy Page (guitar), Robert Plant (vocal/harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass/keyboards/mandolin), and John Bonham (drums), this performance will silence all detractors. The dozen songs from this show are derived primarily from their first two LPs with a few well-chosen covers thrown in for good measure. One particularly interesting inclusion is Plant's spontaneous incorporation of a few lines from Neil Young's \\"Down By The River\\" and \\"On The Way Home\\" during an epic \\"How Many More Times\\". Supplementary shorts on Disc One feature a promotional video for \\"Communication Breakdown\\" - with the band miming to a pre-recorded audio track - a half-hour mini-show for Danish Television, a clip of \\"Dazed And Confused\\" from the British TV programme \\"Supershow\\", as well as a pair of tunes (\\"Communication Breakdown\\" and \\"Dazed And Confused\\") for the French TV show \\"Tous En Scene\\".     The second DVD fast forwards to the '70s and continues with a trio of main attractions and a slew of extras. First up is a composite video for \\"Immigrant Song\\", which contains some amateur footage married to a previously unissued live version of the song. This is followed by outtakes from the motion picture Song Remains The Same (1976), which finds the quartet at Madison Square Garden in 1973. The oft bootlegged 1975 Earl's Court is up next highlighted by acoustic renderings of \\"Going To California\\" and \\"That's The Way\\". The last extended set finds Zep during their triumphant return to England in 1979. It would ultimately be a bittersweet affair as it was likewise their final performance in their homeland prior to the death of Bonham the following year. Extras on Disc Two include a few interview clips, promotional videos for \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" as well as \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\" - both circa the Led Zeppelin (1990) four-CD box set.
B0000AFX64|5.0|Saw this in the cinema as a youngster and loved every second of it! It's interesting watching it again and picking up on all sorts of things that went over my head as a kid. I think this has held up at very nicely, but there are dated bits that are really a joy for that reason. It's a win/win. Long live Battlestar Galactica!
B000002UDB|5.0|When Capitol Records took the Beatles' British EP Magical Mystery Tour and added the rest of the band's '67 material (excluding what was on Sgt. Pepper) they created a hodgepodge album as they usually did, but this time they got it right. If you own this and Sgt. Pepper you have everything the Beatles released in 1967, and that's as good a basis for a music collection as anything. Around Christmas of '67, the Beatles put out Magical Mystery Tour, a six-song soundtrack to their TV special of the same name. The songs on this are fun, a continuation of the Sgt. Pepper hippie songs, but for the most part they are neither groundbreaking, visionary, or &quot;serious,&quot; and the critics were (and still are) a bit disappointed. Magical Mystery Tour is a silly little trifle, but a catchy, enjoyable song, The Fool on the Hill was a popular ballad and is one of my favorite songs and Flying is a rarity, a Beatles instrumental, that's enjoyable but not spectacular. Blue Jay Way is a creepy George song that some find montonous, but is actually very cool; Your Mother Should Know is a great little Paul song in the tradition of When I'm 64 and Martha My Dear; and I am the Walrus, usually recognized as the masterpiece of the bunch is John's unforgettable surrealist manifesto. The performance of the song is one of the otherwise embarassing TV movie's best parts. So, good songs, most not as mind-bending as Revolver or Sgt. Pepper, but solid material.<br />However, the American audience was treated to something more: namely, the rest of the Beatles' singles and B-sides from that year. So next up is Hello Goodbye, another catchy Beatles song which is fun and has that distinctively Beatlish combination of pop and psychedelia. From there on, the album becomes an essential masterpiece. Strawberry Fields Forever, only available on this and the greatest hits compilation Blue Album (it didn't make it on 1), can make the top 2 or 3 every time for most important and best Beatles songs. PennyLane, its flip-side, is Paul's own tribute to a place of his youth. Baby You're a Rich Man captures the Summer of Love in its essence, as does All You Need is Love. These songs are all classics, and their inclusion merits this album 5 stars. Song-by-song, it's actually one of the Beatles' strongest but since it was not an original British album, and since it followed Sgt. Pepper, it is generally underrated by the critics.<br />My favorite songs are: The Fool in the Hill. The character in this song always struck me as Nowhere Man's brother, and it has a very memorable Romantic sound to it. I am the Walrus is dark, sinister, twisted, and awesome, a stream of gibberish that somehow adds up to create a picture of a gleefully demented psyche: this is an acid trip providing cacophany instead of enlightenment. Strawberry Fields Forever is one of John's most profound songs lyrically, exploring the essential loneliness of the human spirit and mind, and musically it was a shot heard round the world, precursor to Sgt. Pepper. Penny Lane is an exploration of life's pleasures and wonders, nostalgia at its best and unforgettable. Baby You're a Rich Man has that thumping, psuedo-Indian sound in the introduction which draws you in right away, luring you to the climax which is found in the chorus. And All You Need is Love, well, I think it speaks for itself.<BR>5/6
B00012QM8G|3.0|I've seen the television broadcast, but here is why I <BR>will not buy this DVD:<br />1. Blood money:   Why should any organization, person, distributor profit by marketing stories about genocide?   I don't see anyone marketing stories about the American Indian Holocost, the Holocost of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, nor Stalins Holocost of 20 million countrymen.  Why is this particular sliver of history written and broadcast again and again, but other historical events are ignored entirely?  Same question goes for cop/lawyer/investigative/who-do-it TV broadcasts that dominate network television.<br />2. Frustrating:  Why didn't these people fight back?  Why not die fighting and at least take out a few enemies on the way out?  This is more a story about the demise of \\"Fish in the Barrel\\"<BR>and \\"Kittens In the Drowning Bag\\".  <br />3. Relevance:  The Nazi pograms Did NOT Happen IN THE UNITED STATES.  American history is not European history.  So why is this stuff marketed daily to American consumers???   Why didn't they build the Washington D.C. Holocost Museum in Europe (Poland in particular), where Europeans can learn about their own history WHERE IT HAPPENED??  Why are these DVDs on every retail shelf when I can't even find DVDs about the American Revolutionary War in my local store?<br />I suspect the answer to all questions resolve to three simple explainations: Money, Money, and Money.  Dumb American consumers<BR>with plenty of disposible income, hungary for violent motion pictures, and entirely ignorant of world history; they love this kind of stuff.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Just effing brilliant.  The type of movie you can watch over and over again, not necessarily to learn new things, but the very concept leads to thought-provoking inner dialogues about the nature of the self, the soul, time, and memory.  The acting is fantastic, cryptic, as we aren't sure how much Leonard really knows about himself (and he doesn't know how much he knows either!)  What role does his subconscious play in his actions?  Has he recorded all that has happened to him, somewhere in his emotions?  Do we even have a subconsious?  What will his future hold?  How can he live?  A masterpiece that should have won some Oscars.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is not a simple film.  I can tell you someone was murdered (or I think I know), and by the end, I'm sure someone commits suicide (or I think I'm sure).  And along the way, there's a lesbian romance between an amnesiac and a dance contest winner with big-screen ambitions; there's a thuggish hit man; a book with important names in it; a film director coerced by mobsters into selecting a particular actress; another hit man made more frightening by his folksy cowboy affectations; a blue cube in which the whole fiction is possibly stored (and a blue key to unlock it); a sinister homeless man living behind a restaurant; and a theater of pantomining performers -- to list just a few of the incongruent oddities that comprise this film.  If you're looking for something different in the way of cinema, this list of characters and props should pique your curiosity.<br /><br />To date, I've seen MULHOLLAND DRIVE between fifteen and twenty times, and I honestly can't tell you with exactness what it's really about.  But it doesn't matter.  Instead of concretely and objectively comprehending it, it's interesting to watch how David Lynch strings all of this together.  Every scene is compelling to watch, and the plot is vaguely alluded to by the similarity of some compositions.  It's just difficult to tell where to look for the rest of it.  In any case, the result is you're seduced into watching it, like being hypnotized, lulled by your fascination with Lynch's dreamy blend of menace and humor, and his sublime imagination.  It's not just a film: It's a journey into the labyrinth of Lynch's creativity.<br /><br />As he's done with some of his other more abstract films, Lynch establishes a unique relationship with his audience.  I believe he's a prankster of sorts, but not one who wishes to make the viewer a fool.  Instead, he weaves the blackest of comedy into a mysterious tale, the humor slithering through it like a hallucinogenic plant through a trellis.  Lynch's respect for the viewer is comprehended only when the viewer allows him- or herself to become part of the humor, by submitting to it.  What appear as segues and non sequiturs then become vignettes in a baroque gallery.  A Lynch film is indirectly about Lynch's imagination.  The art is in the connecting of images and characters of mind-boggling originality, Lynch pushing his imagination to the extreme while respecting some indefinable limit, thereby maintaining a semblance of structure.  The bewildering sequences are so mesmerizing, you don't really care if you get your mind all the way around whatever happened.  Lynch pushes buttons that alternately amuse and repulse us.  He's captured what a dream feels like, with characters reacting to the most puzzling phenomena as if they're commonplace occurrences.  When it's over, you can't with certainty make sense of it.  Feel free to take guesses, but don't take them seriously or you'll deprive yourself of the fun, though \\"fun\\" might be putting an inaccurate spin on Lynch's accomplishment, making it less than what he intended.<br /><br />Let not my gushing over Lynch lead you to believe that he's the only talent in evidence here.  I found all of the actors, even the ones with small roles, to be very convincing.  The script demands that all of the primary actors play two roles, as toward the end -- after the unlocking of the mysterious blue box -- everyone becomes someone else.  The transformation of Naomi Watts from the naive \\"Betty\\" to a downtrodden and betrayed \\"Diane\\" was the most striking.  But Justin Theroux as \\"Adam Kesher,\\" the personally and professionally beleaguered director, was my favorite.  His performance was natural and understated, and the exchange between him and \\"the cowboy\\" is my favorite scene in the film.  The beautiful Laura Elena Harring as \\"Rita\\" is a doe-eyed, quivering victim until the blue box is opened, then confident and patronizing as \\"Camilla Rhodes\\" after the dream is over.<br /><br />Now, here's the caveatabout this DVD: It's not divided into chapters.  If you want to take a look back at a previous scene, for heaven's sake, don't accidentally hit the wrong button.  You'll find yourself back at the very beginning of the film and the only way to get back to where you were is by fast-forwarding.  It's all very weird for a major title release, so this DVD production seems to be an extension of Lynch's bizarre sense of purpose.<br /><br />The DVD's extra features consist of the theatrical trailer, and production notes, the actor and director biographies.  The biographies are typical, each concluding with a list of previous film credits and so on.  Except for Lynch's.  His biography consisted of two lines.<br /><br />\\"Born in Missoula, Montana.\\"<br />\\"Eagle Scout.\\"not divided into chapters.

B000002I2G|4.0|The Doors' fourth album &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; kind of picks up where &quot;Waiting For The Sun&quot; left off. &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; is a &quot;parade&quot; of soft, energizing and sometimes brass-drenched cuts, which shows how versitile The Doors are with their music. Though underrated, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; is not to be ignored. The classic psychedelic Doors sound combined with smart horn sections make this a very unique and enjoyable album.<br />The album begins with the poppy, free-flowing &quot;Tell All The People&quot; which features some nice harmonies, horn work, and singer Jim Morrison's deep dark voice. Following the song is The Doors' hit &quot;Touch Me,&quot; a song combining Morrison's dark, straight forward and demanding lyrics, with his soulful, melodic crooning amongst thick driving horns and melodic strings in the background. It feels like Jim is singing right to you and Ray Manzarek's organ is intense and flawless.<br />One of my favorite songs from this album is the flowing psychedlia of &quot;Shaman's Blues.&quot; The song features catchy; almost swirly melodic chords from Manzarek's organ and smooth guitar playing from Robby Krieger. It is psychedelic pop-rock at its finest; very trippy and laid-back.<br />The next two songs are probably the weakest on the album; &quot;Do It&quot; and Easy Ride.&quot; &quot;Do It&quot; leaves a lot to be desired as Morrison's constant repetition of &quot;Please, please listen to the children....&quot; becomes annoying very quickly. There are some nice powerful guitar chords and organ chords from Kreiger and Manzarek, but there is so much more that could have been done with this song. &quot;Easy Ride&quot; is nothing special. It is simply a more peppy, fast-paced pop-rock tune with some classic wavy-sounding Kreiger guitar work and dancy drum beats from John Densmore. Other than that, not much variety here.<br />Next is &quot;Wild Child,&quot; one of my favorites. Jim's dark, urgent lyrics, John Densmore's unique, marching-like drum-rolls, Robby Krieger's bottle-neck guitar playing, and Ray Manzarek's catchy organ gel together to create one of the more unique songs The Doors have recorded. This is a very infectious song; intense, groovy and foot-stomping.<br />The brass is back on &quot;Runnin' Blue,&quot; a smooth, foot-tapping song that's a little peppier. Again, the horns are thick and melodic and it even features a bit of a country flavor with some banjo strings. This is a personal favorite of mine along with the next song, &quot;Wishful Sinful.&quot; &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; is a dark-tinged piece with dark brooding Morrison lyrics, smooth guitar chords, and serious strings in the background. It is kind of a half crooning, half pop-rock song. Very unique, and it really makes you think.<br />The album ends with the title epic &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; featuring Morrison's intense statement about &quot;Petitioning the Lord with prayer&quot; at the start of the song followed by soft crooning before rushed, energetic drum beats and organ chords take over in a flash of excitement for the ears. The song then shifts musical direction twice; first a slower section where Morrison croons out nursery rhyme-type lyrics and then the section of thumping, stomping, free-flowing drum beats that continues until the end. &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; is quite a &quot;trip&quot; that is hard to describe; you have to listen to it.<br />I personally enjoy &quot;The Soft Parade.&quot; I think it was known as the weakest of all The Doors' efforts, but it is still well worth the listen and a must for every Doors fan. This album was kind of a new direction for The Doors. They can do just about anything! For first-time Doors fans, get to know The Doors by purchasing their first two albums or their &quot;Best Of&quot; album first.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Wow! How can anyone thing that Kanye West cannot flow. HE has the most amusing,witty, and easiest to listen to lyrics I have ever heard. And how can you forget the beats he comes up with. Its amazing how he makes you bob your head without knowing it. Simply put if you want a CD With lyrics that you will memorize after about 3 times through, and beats to bump, cop KANYE WEST.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is a very unique band. They avoid the media, hardly ever show up on their music videos, and just let the music do the talking. I've had this album for about 4 years now. It really is a concept album if you think about it. Stinkfist is an individual's yearning for change, then from Eulogy to Pushit, this individual recalls his past experiences (like flashbacks of one's life before one dies), then Aenema purges these memories, and Third Eye is the rediscovering of one self.  The first month I listened to this CD I really didn't care too much for it, but that's how Tool albums work. They aren't accessible until you are familiar with what they are doing with the music. Then, one day, the volume on my CD player was accidentally turned up a notch. I was too lazy to adjust it, so I just left it there. I was listening to Aenema (the song), and suddenly I had a tool-gasm. I was lightheaded for a minute, and didn't know where I was or what I was doing, being fully immersed in the music. From that moment, I became a fan. No other band that I've ever listened to can do this; build a song up, and then have a climax that is just incredible. <BR>For the un-iniated, I suggest you listen to this CD for quite a while, since it may take a long time to sink in. The apparently stupid buildup of Eulogy will suddenly make sense, and the song Third Eye will grow on you alot. The &quot;fillers&quot; never really do much, but they do add to the mood. (For the love of god, skip them if you don't like them! No one's making you listen to them!) Maynard's vocals are quite soft, so it's a good idea to get the lyrics to the songs. Now to reviews of my favorite tracks.<BR>Eulogy: The BEST track on here, whether you've been listening to the CD for 4 months or 4 years. The intro with the drums is amazing. It's very subtle, so don't expect to hear it if you're listening to it someplace loud.<BR>H.: This song isn't an epic, but the vocals and lyrics are very good, especially the chorus. I was initially turned off by the song because it is kinda homoerotic, but now I think about my friend who moved away every time I hear this song. Definitely get the lyrics for this one.<BR>Jimmy: Wow, the vocals and lyrics. Just wow. I still am not sure what Maynard is singing about, but it's very moving.<BR>Pushit: This song is pretty long. It starts out simple, then really cranks into gear when the band starts jamming. Vocals at the end are great, almost poppy sounding.<BR>Third Eye: This song is basically an extended jam session. It may sound boring at first, but &quot;the pieces fit&quot; once you get used to it. Again, the song really climaxes at the end. Great ending to the CD.<BR>In conclusion, get this CD if you like metal or prog rock. Fans of other genres may like this as well, but it may be too dissonant for people who want a quick fix. If you like this CD, also get Lateralus. The title track is mind-blowingly good.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|this movie is great. everyone is going insane about it. from the title u might think it is another one of those insane movies with the crazy crack heads clowning people around. O! but it is so much more. Donnie Darko is good!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is definitely the best album I've ever heard. The music on here is complex, hard, yet melodic. The distortion that was apparent on Aenima has been turned down a notch, but the songs are still as brutal as ever. I seriously doubt the Tool fans who say that Aenima is a better album, because it simply isn't. They complain that Maynard's lyrics have toned down a bit, which to me suggests that they listen to Tool for headbanging metal and shocking lyrics, and not for the amazing musical journey that the band takes the listener on, which this CD does better than Aenima. It may just be me, but I really dislike short songs with choruses because they tend to lose their appeal over time. With that being said, the songs on Lateralus are much more epic than the songs on Aenima. Each song (aside from the interludes) builds up to a climax, unlike some songs on Aenima which relied on a chorus/verse pattern. Above all else, Lateralus is better than Aenima because each song stands out and is unique. The main reason for this is that the band really jammed the hell outta each of the songs, which allowed the songs to develop much more than some songs on Aenima. (Btw, those people who think Tool purposely stretches their songs to make them long are ignorant. Read the interviews with the band members on the toolshed site. They play around with each song, going in several different directions, then pick out the best moments and put them together. This means that some of the songs are long because it takes time to express an idea or emotion.) Tool has pulled off what Metallica failed to do with the Black Album, change their sound (to a certain extent) while still maintaining the appeal of previous songs. Now for reviews of my favorite tracks.<BR>THE GRUDGE: The is one of those peculiar songs that you can't really get sick of. It has its melodic moments, and its harsh moments, but the song is so varied you will find something you like every time you listen to it.<BR>SCHISM: This song is incredibly catchy, but not in a way that you'll get sick of it immediately. The bass line and lyrics &quot;I know the pieces fit&quot; are just genius. The end of the song is what really makes it special, though. It slowly builds up, then Maynard's vocals come in and it's just one of those tool-gasm moments. <BR>PARABOL/PARABOLA: Parabol is a very beautiful ballad-esque semi-intro to Parabola, with some incredible vocals. Good luck trying to hear the vocals somewhere loud, though, they are super faint unless you turn it up. Parabola has an infectious guitar riff, incredible drumming, and as always superb vocals.<BR>TICKS AND LEECHES: This song would really be a great song if that stupid break in the middle was taken out. Obviously this was meant to be a fairly straight forward song, which might be why some fans complain that it sounds like numetal. The drumming is rediculously fast, and the vocals are interesting. It may not &quot;fit&quot; with the rest of the album, but it certainly isn't a bad song by any stretch of the imagination. I don't believe you can like both this song and Reflection because they are on two ends of the musical spectrum.<BR>LATERALUS: This is the best Tool song ever. From the simple guitar intro, to the explosion of drums and guitar over Maynard's soft vocals, it is very captivating and has lasting appeal. I love the guitar &quot;solo&quot; on here, which really transistions well from the power chords into the softer part of the song. It isn't exactly catchy but just fits in so well with the song. The end of the song is utterly amazing. I'm awestruck everytime I hear that guitar riff at the very end. Note that the song you hear on the radio has been radio edited and isn't the full song.<BR>DISPOSITION/REFLECTION/TRIAD. Every time it rains I am humbled by nature and realize how insignificant my problems are in the grand scheme of things, and it comforts me, and this is the same feeling I get when I listen to Disposition. Reflection, on theother hand, is a good song flawed by a 5 minute (or so) intro. Triad isn't much of a song as it is a bunch of noises. This one I'm impartial to.<BR>To sum up, this CD is amazing and please try to listen to the whole CD more than 10 times before you write a 1 star review.
0446677450|1.0|This is the worst book I have read in a long time. It's totally worthless - if you follow kyosaki's advice you'll end up in the poor house. This is simply a waste of time.<br />Kiyosaki endlessless repeats the same empty stories about his profitable deals. These stories contain no details or any other information a reader can use to make money or to improve his finances. It's like Kiyosaki believes that if he repeats the same nonesense over and over it will become fact. Do yourself a favor: before wasting your time and money on this book, read some of the negative reviews of the book on Amazon.<br />Notice that anyone that tries to say anything bad (or is even mildly critical) about Kiyosaki or his book gets mobbed by Kiyosaki's paid reviewers. Have you noticed the incredible number of positive reviews that are anonymous? Have you noticed that many of the positive reviews include phrases like &quot;thank you Kiyosaki&quot; or &quot;Merry Chirstmas Kiyosaki&quot;... have you wondered why? These are probably phrases used by Kiyosaki or his minions to identify paid reviews and reward them. I don't care if my review gets trashed, these things need to be said. So, thank you Kyosaki!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I love Western. I dont really love sciene fiction. But the idea of a combination seemed like a great idea to me when I heard about Firefly. And yes, it's a good show. And yes, it was wrongfully cancelled by Fox. With another season to go the show would have probably gotten rid of some of its problems. <BR>Because there are a few. A couple of episodes are really slow (and that theme song adds to it, nothing wrong with country music but even the credit sequence seems slow thanks to that song), some feel clumsily directed (Shindig for example with its seemingly neverending dance sequence). Sometimes there isnt really much story in an episode and it shows, things kinda crawl along, nice but not really engaging. Also the show never manages to make anything out of it guest stars, they are mostly in for only a few scenes and hardly have any roles to fill with life.<BR>And even though after wachting a couple of episodes you really get to like the characters on good ol Serentiy they oftentimes  have a very artificial feeling to them. Okay, I buy Nathan Fillion as Captain Mal, good old fashioned tough guy with a heart. But cute Jewel Straite as mechanic Kaylee - sorry, just because you smeer some grease in a pretty actress face and have her fumble around with some screws doesnt make her a believable mechanic. Same goes for Alan Tudyk as the Pilot. He pushes some buttons, but you never for a second buy that he's the capable pilot of a spaceship. Of course its science fiction, but when you create your own world you gotta make it believable and in Firefly very often I feel things are existing just because Whedon and his folks want them to exist and too often they fail in making us believe. <BR>Plus there is, similar to Buffy, an uneven balance of the right dialogue at the right time. Often you get funny oneliners that just feel wrong, that feel written, because the writer thinks there funny (and they are), but they are just wrong for the character and the things that happen in the story at that moment. Adam Baldwins character Jayne is good example: sometimes he's a real mean dude, someone you fear, because you never know what he's gonna do next or which side he's on, then the next time he's played for laughs and comes across as a bulky idiot. <BR>But all these flaws aside its a good show to watch and to recommend, not perfect, but I would have loved to see things evolving in another season. I would have loved to see what happened in the classic love-hate-relationship of Mel and Inora, I would have loved to see who the preacher really is (because for now he's a rather boring character which the writers never made much use of - but you get hints, he might be a real badass). I would have loved to see the show pick up speed and make use of its strenghs. Too bad televison nowadays hardly gives a show a second chance. But in the case of Firefly we at least have the feature film to look forward too. I cant wait to see in which ways Whedon takes his show to the big screen.

B00008BRBG|4.0|It's the late '70s, the British punk invasion just started. Bands like The Sex Pistols and The Clash reigned supreme. Right before the predecessors like Blondie and Devo made big in the '80s. Also in that time, The Police came along.<br />The Police members Sting (the group's bassist and vocalist), Stewart Copeland (drummer), and Andy Summers (guitarist) were no newcomers. Seasoned (Andy Summers had been in a line-up of The Animals) aside, they also had more talent than your average punk band. Lots more.<br />This is The Police's debut album, and maps out what was to come in the '80s. Elements of pop, reggae, punk, and jazz are all fused together on Outlandos d'Amour in symmetry.<br />The album opens with \\"Next To You\\", the fast-paced, and most punk influenced song on the album.<BR>The next track, \\"So Lonely\\", immediately opens up with an catchy white reggae-rock bass riff, showing what to expect of the rest of the album.<BR>\\"Roxanne\\" shows how well Sting writes his infectious pop melodies, with one of the most memorable lyric hooks<BR>in the history of '70s music, telling the story of a girl who turns to prostitution, singing some Steven Tyler-esque notes along the way. After that, the album basically goes on repeat (power pop, punk-infused rock, rinse-and-repeat), highlights along the way being \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" and \\"Hole In My Life\\". Until, the closing song, the Jamaican funk of \\"Masoko Tanga\\" is one of my personal favorites. As, it also shows Sting's powress as a bassist.<br />Outlandos d'Amour was ahead of it's time. It showcases Sting as one of rock's great melody writers, and also what was to come from The Police, Sting, and the rest of mainstream '80s.

0789723107|4.0|If there's a book to use when introducing someone to the ideas of usability on the Web, I'd have to say that I think this is it. Not Nielsen, and not Cooper (at least not to start with). Steve Krug's &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; has the most no-nonsense and easy-to-follow approach I think I've ever seen, and best of all, he makes SENSE.<br /><br />First of all, Krug deconstructs some of the sites we all know and use often, and he does so to help us see what we should be doing, as well as what we should not.  I remember being especially impressed with his in-depth analysis of Amazon.com's navigation scheme (Chapter 6 - &quot;Street Signs and Breadcrumbs&quot;), from the use of tabs to the structure of the sub-navigation to color changes, he covers it all with a sense of humor, clear pictorial examples, a sharp eye for detail, and a clear concise explanation of what works and why.  The reader is left with a greater understanding of not only why Amazon has been so successful, but also what choices they made that helped them find this solution.<br /><br />The chapter on usability testing (Chapter 9 - &quot;Usability Testing on 10 cents a day&quot;) was another fine example of clear communication and great ideas.  Krug's breakdown of how the usability process should be conducted, and why it's needed in the first place, is concise and not preachy, as some usability authors are, and it really gives the reader an excellent idea of how they can fit usability into their process.  This is probably the best way to &quot;sell&quot; usability to someone, and he does a great job of it.<br /><br />The whole book is like that, really, but those chapters were highlights in the book for me.  His ideas on simplicity of presentation and home page design were also well-taken, both as a designer and as someone who uses the web.  Perhaps that is what makes his book so excellent, is that really, anyone could get something out of it.  Whether it's the person who surfs the web now and again or the one who designs the pages for it or the one who's paying for the person to design pages for it, anyone could read this book and benefit from it, without having to wade through piles of needless verbage or proselytizing.<br /><br />In the end, &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; seems to be an example of what it advises... it keeps things simple and accessible for a wide variety of people, and thereby makes itself useful as an excellent resource.  The next time someone asks me what Web usability is all about, this is the first book I'll be recommending to them.one who designs the pages for it or the one who's paying for the person to design pages for it, anyone could read this book and benefit from it, without having to wade through piles of needless verbage or proselytizing.<BR> <BR>In the end, &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; seems to be an example of what it advises... it keeps things simple and accessible for a wide variety of people, and thereby makes itself useful as an excellent resource.

B00006879E|5.0|It is quite a feat to convey depth and range of emotion enough in 3-5 minutes and move the listener to sympathy, empathy or nostalgia. It is a colossal feat to create an entire album where each song is like a compelling chapter in a fantastic book. And that is what this band has accomplished.  Every song possesses four key elements that make great music (and great story telling): crafty, thought-provoking lyrics, genre diversity, unique and original melodies and harmonies, and all the writing and playing is actually done by the band members.  This is how music was intended to be...not the mass- manufactured, mindless pop drivel the music industry serves at a rate comparable to a fast-food burger joint.  Songs About Jane tells an age-old story in a refreshing manner without a single disappointing chapter.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is one of the first comic book films that I absolutly had to have when it came out on dvd.  Easily one of the best comic book films ever, spiderman is nothing short of a right place, right time film.. As we all know, 9-11 took place, and after that, people just needed something to get them happy, and spiderman just happend to be out at the time, so that helped its HUGE boxoffice turnout.  I love how film didnt show off all of what spiderman can do, which will make spiderman 2 even more kick ass.  I also love the fact the they didnt not really use universally known actors in the leading roles.  I think it makes it more real then say.. Daredevil, in which a HUGE bignamed star was the hero, a huge named actress was the leading lady, and a BIG actor in Micheal Duncun for the villien.  This movie was more realistic and more correct.  Great start to which will become a great franchise.
038073186X|5.0|Lehane is truly a great suspense writer.  I have not read his dectective novels; only the amazing Mystic River (which was better than the movie btw).  So, perhaps I do not judge him quite the same as some other reviewers. Mystic River is a brillant study of friendship, responsibility and shattered dreams.  Although this novel has those same themes, Lehane approaches this book in a much different way.  It is spooky, atmospheric, and twisting. Even makes some interesting points about mental health treatment in America.  The story is excellent and the ending is indeed a shocker.  What I liked about it, besides being almost completely shocked (I figured out only one small part), was how it fit.  The book does not make an outrageous leap at the end and the ends are indeed tied up.  Honestly surprising book until the last sentence.  So few thrillers do that.  It was nice to read a surprising and frankly a scary novel that was not absurd.  It all works.  I admire Lehane's mind.  I just don't want to visit it anytime soon.
B00005JM0B|1.0|Ok, I will say this, this was not the worst film I have ever seen by far, but it is honestly the worst film in the triligy.  COME ON, the director honestly wanted u to beleave that a SUPER FINE chick could be scary and entertaining. Well, they were half right, in which she was pretty entertaining, but that is NOT why terminator kicked (...).  Terminator had what few legendary films have, GRITTY REALISIM.  Even thou most of the stuff in 1 and 2 were fantastic, there was still a sense of realism and horror in them. T1: A scrany human agaist a armord thinking cyborg who is emotionless, thats cool.  T2: 2 Terminators, one trying to stop the machines, one trying to win for them, and the more advance Terminator is this scrany lookin guy, but can kick arnolds ass.  VERY COOL.  Then we have T3.... Hmmm, hot chick, bad Term.  Arnold once again good Term.  The chick didnt scare me at all.  And arnold had some bad script lines also.  Basically what this film did was say that T1 and 2 where a complete waste of time because judgement day is enevetable...  And this movie NEVER feels like A TERMINATOR movie at all.  It was like a copy cat movie of a terminator movie.  If you want a classic sci fi movie, buy the first 2 imediatly, and just pretend that this one doesent exist.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This album is possibly the best rock album since The Talking Heads masterpiece \\"remain in light\\".  Jeff tweedy's song writing is not to be believed.  Anybody who doesn't like this album is clearly avert to change.  These people are pushing the boundries of what music is.  These people are all about the music, theres no glitz, glam, or sex appeal.  It's just a bunch of guy writing and playing some of the greatest music ever written.  If you dont like this album, you obviously aren't smart enough to get it.   The music is far to sophisticated for anyone who likes rap or pop.

The most uplifting song on the album and a very beautiful love song. PERFECT 5/5<br />Trouble - Great song. Makes you pity Chris.4/5<br />Parachutes - Very short. Not much to say. 3/5<br />High Speed - Another sort of upbeat song. Pretty Good. 3/5<br />We Never Change - My fave song on the album. Some might say its a little dark but ithink this song might give others hope for the future. Don't ask me how. I could really relate to these lyrics. A very modest song and it makes you realize how little material things matter. 5/5<br />Everything's Not Lost - I don't particularly like this song but it's great to lift your spirits on a bad day. At the end you can't help but sing along. 4/5

B000001DTM|5.0|Berlin, 1990.  U2 are months removed from the end of the \\"Lovetown\\" tour, and they are struggling to figure out  what to do, as the recording sessions for the untitled new project began.  For the first time in their career,  they were getting nowhere, and fast.  Add this to the fact that there were massive disagreements about the  creative direction they should take, and the fact that The Edge was going through a difficult split from his wife  at the time, and you have one very tense, very uncertain atmosphere for these recording sessions.  It was a  breakdown of sorts, and U2 nearly broke up.  Were it not for one song, they may have never released anything  together again.<br />Fortunately, that song did come to be, and the rest is history, as it quickly led to U2 finding their groove and  figuring out what they wanted to do.  Achtung Baby was a much darker, much more techno and dance-oriented then  anything they had ever done.  Bono's lyrical fortes have always been politics and sexual innuendo, and after a  decade of political music, this album is straight a love-sex-relationships-loss record, which is no surprise as  The Edge was going through his own marital split at the time and Bono was also having some problems(which have  since been resolved) concerning touring and being away from his family for so long.  This record captures all the  different ways love can manifest itself, and, in contrast, the different ways it can be lost.  Highlights include  chart hits 'Even Better Than The Real Thing', 'The Fly', and 'Mysterious Ways', live favorite \\"'ntil The End Of  The World'(which has generated so amazing performances), unknown gems 'So Cruel', \\"'Ultraviolet', 'Acrobat', and  'Love Is Blindness'.<br />When one things \\"Achtung Baby\\", however, one thinks of one song.  'One' is often considered as being right up with  \\"Yesterday\\" in terms of the greatest rock ballads ever written, and more importantly is the song that saved U2  from breakup.  To quote Larry Mullen Jr., \\"I remember walking into the control room, and hearing this riff, it's  the riff from One, and just thinking, 'that is IT, THIS is something special\\".  For me the brilliance of \\"One\\" is  that it has so many different meanings that no one has ever been able to pinpoint its original genesis lyric-wise.  It could be talking about tolerance and acceptance amongst the human race, it could be talking about AIDS, it  could be talking about a relationship gone bad, it could even be talking about the band itself, as in the band  members are not the same but they have to carry each other in order to make the band work.  Just a brilliant song,  as are most of the songs on this record(come on, there are only three songs on it that I haven't mentioned).<br />What's perhaps even more brilliant than this record is the way in which U2 decided to tour it.  I am convinced  that no tour will ever be able to touch the spectacle that was, \\"ZooTV\\".  The brilliance of this tour lies in its  intent: on the outside, when you see Bono strut on stage in a leather outfit with fly shades and slicked back  hair, the band with massive amounts of hardware behind them, the first reaction is that they're a band that has  let superstardom go to their heads, a group of arrogant individuals.  However, this is not the case.  The intent  of this tour is to, in fact, make fun of the importance the media puts on things like U2 by putting all those huge  TV screens on stage, while at the same time using them to bring more important issues to the public's doorstep:  the gulf war, the sarajevo linkups(in which Bono talked to young people in Sarajevo during its wartime, via  satellite, during shows), etc.<br />The most amazing part of all this is that U2 were able to make such drastic changes, take such big risks for  already being the biggest band in the world, and be able to not only maintain that title, but attract legions of  new fans at the same time, while still being true to the music THEY wanted tomake.  That hasn't happened very  often at all.  Ever.  Fans will argue over which of masterpiece #3(\\"The Joshua Tree\\") or masterpiece #4(This) is  better, but I say, just appreciate \\"Achtung Baby\\" for what it is: A great, groundbreaking rock record.to make.  That hasn't happened very  often at all.  Ever.

B00005JM4Z|2.0|2 Fast 2 Furious is a stupefying glance into Hollywood.  It seems to represent a new kind of filmmaking where the bare minimum will do, revealing a real contempt for even the popcorn movie audience.<br />The film shouldn't be expected to do much to begin with.  If you ever saw the preview, you'd think it was supposed to be stupid, summer fun.  There's nothing wrong with that, everyone grew up with popcorn summer movies in their lives, whether it was the 70s, 80s, 90s, whatever.  But this is a new chapter, I think.  The line between good video games and movies like this has been completely blurred.  I found the film so inept in even the intended aims, that I sat open-mouthed, speechless, watching the film unfold in what seemed like three times its actual length.<br />I don't know where to begin.  The first film was what it was, a summer popcorn movie with fast, silly street machines racing, Vin Diesel inventing a career, and that was about it.  A sequel was almost a no-brainer, indeed.<br />First off, I'm in disbelief that this was directed by John Singleton.  A promising young black director back when Boyz in the Hood appeared, he has now been completely neutralized by Hollywood.  After all, why should white directors have a monopoly on crap?  I can only hope Singleton was paid well for his troubles, as I believe his does have some talent.<br />The film takes place in Miami, where the 'hero' of the original, no longer a copy, is now living a subsistence life street-racing.  He gets involved with some Cuban drug barons and an old friend who wound up in jail, etc, etc.  It doesn't matter.  The story and plotting are so ludicrous, it doesn't matter.  There isn't even an attempt at credibility, so I guess some credit is deserved.  In fact, the only way to really watch a movie like this and even try to enjoy it is to completely disregard any story or plot, and just trust that the dots somehow connect, at least on paper.  Speaking of Ludacris, he appears as some kind of heavily-connected gangsta thug who promotes these street races in neighborhoods the cops don't even bother patrolling.<br />But the main draw of the film is the car chases, and the cars.  And I have to say, even in this, they've pretty much failed to deliver.  Yes, there are some wild street machines.  And there are plenty of chases.  But only a couple of stunts impress at all.  There appeared to be so much trickery involving the scenes, it was disappointing and lame.  The opener says it all.  I don't know how they've done it, but the shots of the drivers in their cars look very fake and processed.  Sure, I know the actors aren't driving, but you can tell digital fakery was involved, and if you look closely, there is a dearth of scenery from real, actual, impressive stunt driving.  It looks boring, and that's the real crime.<br />The acting is appalling on all fronts.  The only person of any note or credibility is James Remar, character actor extraordinaire, always with a menacing face.  He has a side role. The two main stars are so bad, the film at times resembles a reading for the film, as opposed to the film.  They both look like male models saying lines, and indeed, at least one of them is.<br />If you like video games, go and play Midnight Club Street Racing 2, or Burnout and its sequels, because they are the equivalent of watching this film.

B000001FTQ|5.0|After the &quot;Unforgettable Fire Tour&quot;, which accompanyed the album of the same title, U2 had some side gigs.  They played some gigs for Amnesty International's Conspiracy Of Hope tour, and they played Live Aid.  This EP is simply two live songs from that period of time, plus two b-sides from that period of time.  Note that the version of &quot;Bad&quot; on this EP is unequivically NOT the legendary Live Aid version that spanned the better part of 30 minutes.  U2 never officially released that track, a smart move in my opinion, as it preserves the mistique of that performance.  <br />Back to this EP, &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;A Sort Of Homecoming&quot; are great, and it was also a good place to hear the b-sides &quot;Love Comes Tumbling&quot; and &quot;The Three Sunrises&quot; for those who hadn't heard it before.  In this time period, especially with the Live Aid performance of &quot;Bad&quot;, the public was 'wide awake' with anticipation for what this band would do next, which put quite a bit of pressure on U2 for their next LP.  U2 were on the brink of superstardom, but not even they knew what their next LP would start.
B0000541AM|5.0|Listen boppers, this is a great gang flick that has a small crew chased down by every gang in NYC after they are wrongly accused of killing Cyrus (the local crime boss) at the Bronx Zoo.  The Warriors have to make it from the upper bronx to coney island with every gang in town trying their own unique ways of knocking them off.  A local radio announcer (the woman from where in the world is carmen san deigo) narrates their progress downtown, tipping off rivals and setting up further confrontation.  a great movies for all ages.
B000001F3C|5.0|U2's first two albums were both very good records in their own right, while similtaniously showing vast potential for something greater.  That potential was confirmed as reality with their third LP, &quot;War&quot;.  <br />This is, generally speaking, where the &quot;U2&quot; the general public is familiar with, begins.  On this record, U2 found both their musical niche and their political voice, with such classics as 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and 'New Year's Day'.  This was, and still is, U2's angriest record, and it shows, with songs like the previously mentioned ones, as well as the lesser-known hits, 'Two Hearts Beat As One' and 'Surrender', the unheralded classics 'Like A Song' and 'Drowning Man', and the song that would go on to close U2's shows in the 80s, '&quot;40&quot;'.  This was a young, energetic, angry, rebel group, stripped of the innocence of &quot;Boy&quot;.  <br />This was U2's first masterpiece, which is saying something since, as only their third record, is a better record than some bands ever make, and it really opened the door for them to become even bigger, even greater.  For, make no mistake, this was also STILL a very hungry band as well.
B000002IOW|5.0|After the quartet of albums that featured heavy emphasis on synths during the 80's, Rush finally seemed to rediscover the balance of synths and guitar that they did on Moving Pictures. The synth work on here is very good, but they are simply a way to add atmosphere to the song, instead of being a main element. Alex's guitar finally starts to return here, which is a good thing. The lyrics are some of the best Peart has written, especially on songs like The Pass, which is about suicide, and my personal favorite, Anagram (For Mongo). This is also much more groove to the songs than in the past, mostly evident in the songs Scars and Superconductor.
B0000004V2|5.0|People are starting to bash this CD.  Please, they are all wet!  This CD is PERFECT.  EVERY second of this CD is absolutely amazing.  Melodic, timeless(!!!), uplifting, thirst-quenching, day-breaking, love-making, soul saving.  The guitar playing is flawless (see: JAMMING last 5 minutes of I Am The Resurrection).  The airy vocals of Ian Brown (heard throughout).  The driving bass (Fool's Gold/I Am The Resurrection) and ecstatic drums (She Bangs the Drums, This Is The One, Fool's Gold).  There is not one dud in the whole group.  I have listened to this CD HUNDREDS of times and it still makes me feel like life is perfect (although it is far from it).<br />If you like pop music.  If you aren't a crabby, contrarian.  (fragmented sentences for dramatic effect. ;) )  If you LOVE great tunes, BUY THIS CD and enrich your life.  You'll thank me for gushing like this when you experience this work of genius.  I am not being generous, I am being honest.
B00024I31C|4.0|I'd call this Cale's best since Troubador from 1976.  JJ went To Tulsa And Back to record this harder-edged collection.  It contains unargueably some of his best laid-back tunes, that  harken back to JJ's early Shelter years albums, like Naturally, Really and Okie.    JJ used some of his hometown pals to record about half of these new songs in Tulsa, and the results sounds great!   &quot;Blues For Mama&quot; is a must for any blues fan, with its melancholy melody, moanfully wailing guitar licks and from-the-gut vocal.   &quot;New Lover&quot; is an energetic rocker led by Cale's driving guitar, and it screams, &quot;Oh Eric, book some studio time&quot;.   &quot;The Problem&quot; (a political message) is destined to be a Cale classic, with his coarse whispery vocal, and acidic lead guitar, fueled along by that incredible Tulsa Sound.  Aware of life on the streets, JJ gives us a view of  a pair living it in &quot;Homeless&quot;.  Another favorite on this cd is &quot;Fancy Dancer&quot;, one of those rhythmic tunes that you can't sit still to.   JJ Cale delivered a gem this time... get a copy!  <BR>    Cale is out on one of his rare tours, so don't miss a legend!
B000068TPN|3.0|This is a solidly made war film, which at the start seemed to be a highly conservative take on the Vietnam war.<br />Yet unlike other films, it does not demonise the North Vietnamese. It does not make them out to be saints either.<br />The Vietnamese have intelligent generals and their soldiers are brave. The Americans leadership is  shown as little able to deal with Vietnam and it leads to useless carnage on the battlefield.<br />The film gives the impression that many hands went into wrting scenes and it jumps uneasily from liberal to conservative viewpoints. Some scenes are simply too heavy handed. At the end of it, I felt it was a good film with some sound ideas, but it just could not make up its mind which way it wanted to jump.<br />The one overwhelming weak point. Mel Gibson is simply dreadful in his role. Someone should have at least excised the scene of him crying because he could not die with his men. I suspect the actor wanted it in there to show his dramatic range.<br />It has some good things, but it is badly let down at times by some leaden writing.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Either Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon is brilliant or deranged; but it either case, his risky gamble on the season six episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; paid off brilliantly, even when using the entire cast's actual voices for the show.  Sarah Michelle Gellar's &quot;Going Through the Motions&quot; nicely display her range as an actress, while Amber Benson's &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; is heartwarming and sweet.  &quot;I'll Never Tell&quot;, performed by Nicholas Brendon and Emma Caulfield, is hilarious, while James Marsters' gothic metal laced &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; show off his great voice and Anthony Stewart Head's &quot;Standing&quot; is simply heartbreaking.  The entire cast unite for &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot; which along with &quot;Coda&quot; nicely close out the episode and this disc, followed by the excellent orchestral suites from &quot;Restless&quot;, &quot;Hush&quot;, and &quot;The Gift&quot;, and ending with &quot;Something to Sing About&quot; performed by Joss and his wife Kai Cole.  The cast of Buffy is solid throughout, though some are better suited to not quit their day job (Alyson Hannigan and Michelle Trachtenberg), while the three suites are awesome extras.  This CD is definitely worth owning for Buffy fans, just about all of whom no doubt enjoyed the spectacular episode that this disc draws from.
B000001FRY|5.0|The 1960s were a great decade for rock music.  The 1970s were not so great, but they did have one upside: punk music.  This scene included such bands as The Ramones, The Clash, and The Cure.  In the mid-to-late 70s, a new Irish band called U2 were majorly influenced by this music, and aspired to be a &quot;punk band&quot;.  It is important to note that U2 were not always &quot;U2&quot;, and that there WAS a time when they couldn't play their instruments very well.  Because of this they were sort of forced to write their own music to play, because they didn't know HOW to play anybody else's.  As a result of this, they didn't quite make the kind of music those punk bands made, but instead a similar, yet distinctly different sound, created during the writing and recording process for this debut, &quot;Boy&quot;, which for all intents and purposes started a full three or four years before it was even released.  It was a unique sound, and it was their sound, the sound they would keep for three decades, the sound on which they would ride the waves of new artists, rock superstars, and legends of the music business.<br />The songs on this record flow in and out of each other, as if they were one whole.  In fact, tracks 3 and 4, 'An Cat Dubh' and 'Into The Heart' were originally one song, even played live as a single entity.  It was split in two for the record because as one song, it was too long.  Incidentally, it's one of the high points of the record.  Other highlights include the anthemic 'I Will Follow', the angsty 'Out Of Control', 'A Day Without Me' in which Bono was singing about child neglect and abuse over a decade before Eddie Vedder sang about a boy named Jeremy, 'Another Time Another Place', and the haunting closer, 'Shadows And Tall Trees', the title of which was taken from the title of chapter from the literary classic, 'The Lord Of The Flies'.  All in all, this is one of great rock debuts I've ever heard, it pocesses an innocence that perhaps U2 never had again after this record.  In closing, I would be remiss not to mention a b-side from this record, called '11 O'Clock Tick Tock'.  Its significance is that it was one of the earliest live fan favorites, and it remains so to this day.  In fact, at a typical U2 show, the crowd usually emits some of its loudest and most enthusiastic cheers when the opening chords to 11 O'Clock or I Will Follow or Out Of Control are played.  It gives the feeling of being a true fan, for being familiar with the REALLY old stuff, the music of U2 before they were &quot;U2&quot;.
B000002H6C|5.0|Many people say that Master Of Puppets was their best record, but I disagree. Metallica hit a writing and musical peak here that was never to be equaled again (St. Anger tried to, and failed miserably). They almost sound progressive at times. Favorite song: Dyers Eve.
0385510438|3.0|Not exactly what I'm used to from a Grisham novel, but a decent story nonetheless.  Tale is set in Clanton, Mississippi, where a young man with his rich aunt as a benefactor is able to purchase the town's only newspaper, the Times.  Circulation is decent at best, until a spectactular murder occurs with a member of the town's most notorious crime family (the Padgitts) as the prime suspect.  In a world where justice is for sale and judges are for hire, a jury of 12 of the suspect's peers find him guilty of rape and murder, and sentence him to life--which by Mississippi standards is never any longer than 10 years.<br />Over the course of the incarceration, Willie Traynor, main character and owner of the times, manages to create a very successful newspaper while writing at times various human interest stories.  One story in particular is about one of Clanton's &quot;colored&quot; families; Callie and Esau Ruffin, who reared 8 children, 7 of whom went on despite all of the prejudice to get their doctorate degrees.  During the process of writing the story Willie develops a bond with Callie....who also just happens to be one of the twelve jurors who convicted Danny Padgitt of murder.  Willie is also busy keeping tabs on Danny, and his parole bids....especially since Danny threatened the lives of the jurors if they ever found him guilty.....<br />Again, a little slow at first.  I think Grisham would have been better served to concentrate more on Padgitt, his incarceration, and the like rather than the friendship/small town happenings aspect of the story.  Is Grisham getting soft in his old age??  <br />Not bad, but if you want fast, this is not the one to read.<br />DYB
B00005R2M3|3.0|While this CD isn't half-bad, I still believe that Shakira just sounds better in Spanish. This isn't a diss on her English skills but I believe that singers just sound better in their native language. I would recommend to pick up one of her CDs with songs in Spanish (or even her album that has her Greatest Hits in Spanish) instead of this CD.
B000294SFW|5.0|While Motorhead will never be the same without \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke (kinda like KISS without Ace), this is arguably the groups strongest effort since \\"Ace Of Spades\\".  The crowning achievement  is Phil Campbell's guitar playing.    Phil must have gone back and retaken \\"Angus 101\\" because the killer riffs are  flyin' big time.  He even lets out a few \\"fuzz-wah\\" solos that would make former guitarist Brian Robertson sit up and take notice.  Mickey Dee's drumming is as brilliant as ever; one of metal's best.  Lemmy?  Recharged, juiced, reborn, dynamic, inspired...do I need to keep going?   His singing is all killer, no filler; you could swear the vocals were recorded 25 years ago.  Finally you have the appearance of fretboard wiz Steve Vai, yawn, on few tracks.  Vai, not being a \\"heavy metal\\" player per se,  sounds a little out of place here; similar to the way a  previously mentioned Brian Robertson did on the  \\"Another Perfect Day\\" album. Vai's playing is technically brilliant (and okay for David Lee Roth),  but just a little too slick & elegant for \\"heavy metal\\"...let alone a Motorhead album.  Regardless, Vai's presence obviously has raised Campbell's playing to a new level.  I have always been disappointed in Campbell's guitar work.  I never felt he was able to handle the guitar chores on his own since the departure of Wurzel after the \\"Bastards\\" album.   I am happy to admit he has finally proved me wrong. <BR>For the diehard Motorhead fan, adding this album to \\"cart\\" is a no brainer.  Heck for any fan of metal this is a no brainer.  Could this be the best metal album of 2004?  It has my vote.
B00006RG9K|5.0|THE REVIEEWRS GIVING THIS DVD ONE STAR MUST REALLY HATE GENESIS.<BR>WHY DON'T THEY REVIEW BRTNEY SPEARS INSTEAD- GET  LIFE!
B000001E18|5.0|Midway through the massive two-and-a-half year &quot;ZooTV&quot; tour, U2 took a break and went into the studio to record  some tracks for an EP.  One thing led to another, and it turned into a full-length record, &quot;Zooropa&quot;.  This record  goes hand-in-hand with &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, it's in the same vein of musical exploration.  Yet, many fans don't  appreciate this record because of its less-accessable nature than previous outings.  This is a shame, because on  this record U2 have managed to create a sound so unique, that perhaps no other band has ever made anything like it  before.  Perhaps no one ever will.  Highlights like the other-worldly 'Lemon', the heartbreaking ballad  'Stay(Faraway, So Close)', the propoganda-satirizing title track 'Zooropa', The Edge's most recent lead-vocal  outing, 'Numb', and 'The First Time' create a soundscape that makes you wonder if you're still on Earth.  This  record is quite relaxing, yet its subject matter is anything but.  If &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was an album about love and  relationships and loss, this record is about what happens after that loss, what happens next, how does life go on,  whether it be flirting('Babyface'), unrequited love('Stay(Faraway, So Close)'), new love('The First Time'), anger  at the party lost('Dirty Day'), struggling with self-image('Zooropa'), or depression('Numb').  <br />&quot;Zooropa&quot;, it is my believe, cannot be fully appreciated without &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, and vice versa.  They could have  been a double album together and it wouldn't have made any difference in how fans think of them.  This record is a  grower, no question, but once it grows on you, it's as good as any U2 record.
B000000H5J|5.0|The ultimate combination of man and machine music, but lyrically focusing on the war against that very machine. Some samples and ideas here are taken from Terminator 2 (just listen to Zero Signal and H-K (Hunter-Killer) which is a type of robot in the movie). One thing that sets Fear Factory apart from other bands (of the time, at least) is the interchanging vocals of Burton C. Bell, changing from a fierce angry yell, to a clean singing voice. Another is the fact that the drums follow the guitars which, along with the electronic effects, make the band sound machine-like.
B000294SFW|5.0|motorhead give you straight forward metal everytime and steve vai rips solos on two songs and there is also a acoustic blues song to end the disc<br />best vintage cuts are terminal show,killer,and the wolf
B0001I55SS|4.0|OK let's get the bad things about the Black Hole out of the way first of all. Some of the dialogue is unbelievably naff. It has an overtly judgemental morality which runs throughout the film from start to finish. Very occasionally the SFX slip, and you see wires holding up robots etc. Some of the scenes are cloying, particularly involving the antics of the overly cute, heroic robots... Also the makers would have done better to remember what effect the vacuum of Space would have on people NOT wearing spacesuits...<br /><br />Put all that aside though and you are left with a minor sci fi masterpiece. Atmospherically the film is an outright winner - it is just so gothic, from its sets, robots, and cowled and hooded undead crew. It also boasts one of the very best musical scores by John Barry. Visually it is stunning, Space has seldom looked this good. The blue/black background of space with its dense clusters of stars looks as good as it did on the day that it was released. Unlike Star Wars and its visibly dated mattes, this film has more than withstood the test of time.<br />The film's visual pinnacle though is the giant space ship Cygnus.<br />A cross between Brighton Pier and The Eiffel Tower, this gothic behemoth is like no other. The scene where its lights are switched on suddenly and unexpectedly, is one of awe and beauty.<br />The exploration of the ship, culminating in the arrival in the control tower is stunning. Ditto the firing up of the ship's Frankenstein Lab like reactors and huge engines for its final journey to the Black Hole. Even in its death throes, this huge vessel retains a sad dignity.<br />Acting honours go to Maximilian Schell as an intergalactic Captain Nemo. Ernest Borgnine, Anthony Perkins, Yvette Mimeux, and Robert Forster all provide very able support though.<br />The blood red robot Maximilian (I wonder how that name was arrived at...) is an inspired creation, and has a temperament to match its colour scheme...<br /><br />The dvd is great, picture and sound are both superb. Playing the film in 5.1 Dolby Digital on your home cinema is something else, especially when your memory of the film in the cinema is in mono. All sound channels are free of distortion and nicely separated. Both Surround channels in particular are superb.<br />Get this dvd if you can (it is due to be re released anyway) and add one of sci fi's most underrated films to your collection.Playing the film in 5.1 Dolby Digital on your home cinema is something else, especially when your memory of the film in the cinema is in mono.

0060730552|2.0|I could not wait to read this after seeing Joe Simpson on Letterman. I was mesmerized by the story he told. <BR>This book was so hard to get through, way too many in depth technical terms, it was like reading a foreign laguage.This book was written for climbers. I could not wait for him to fall and break his leg already. I would still buy Joe a drink if I ever saw him out. <br /> If you want to read a great survival story I HIGHLY suggest Into Thin Air.  <BR>Stick to the documentary that is now on DVD and don't waste time with the book.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Unlike most, I don't really care what Lucas does to his films. Even if he chose to let the original theatrical versions be added to the set, I would never watch them. I would watch the updated versions. I will agree with most that \\"Empire\\" is the best of the three films, but even the few enhanments done on the film do not distract me from still thinking how great a film it is.<br />Now, I also know that Lucas is tweaking the films again. John Williams has made it known that the \\"Imperial March\\" is being added to \\"A New Hope\\" plus a better version of Han with Jabba. And I've also heard that he might be restoring the Han shoots first scene, but who knows.<br />As for adding Hayden as Anakin in the trees of Endor at the end of \\"Return\\" is kind of cool (except if your the actor who played the role originally).<br />I just want this series on DVD, and I'm hoping that with \\"Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (?)\\", Lucas redeems himself from the very disappointing first two films (though, \\"Attack of the Clones\\" is way better than \\"Phantom Menace\\")<br />Bring it on.
B000001FS6|5.0|During the &quot;Joshua Tree Tour&quot;, director Phil Joanou captured a massive amount of footage, to be sorted and used in a  documentary about U2 and this tour.  To quote Edge: &quot;No one could really remember when it went from being this small project that we all knew what it was and could deal with it, to being this big thing, but at some point that shift occured.&quot;  Indeed it did, and this documentary morphed into a massive project, resulting in a movie and eventual home video, and a new album, a double album of sorts, a mix of live material from the &quot;Joshua Tree Tour&quot; and brand new studio material.  <br />As far as the live stuff is concerned, U2 are a phenomenal live band, so the live stuff is great.  But some of the best live performances that were in the movie were left off the album(Streets, With Or Without You, Running..., and the powerful Sunday Bloody Sunday on the night of the Enniskillen bombing, featuring his now notorius 'f**k the revolution' speech).  The best thing to come out of &quot;Rattle And Hum&quot; is the new material.  'All I Want Is You', 'Angel Of Harlem', and 'Desire' are classics, and are part of the live set to this day.  The B.B. King collaberation, 'When Love Comes To Town' is a sore spot among U2 fans...some love it, some hate it, I think it's good but not great.  Lesser-known gems from this record are 'Hawkmoon 269', 'Heartland', 'Love Rescue Me', and 'God Part II', and 'Van Dieman's Land', which is one of three songs in the U2 catalog to feature The Edge on lead vocals(the previous one was on &quot;War&quot; and entitled 'Seconds').<br />U2 recieved quite a bit of backlash when &quot;Rattle And Hum&quot; was released, labeled as arrogant and presumtious to put themselves in the rock pantheon of the Beatles and Dylan.  It was clearly misunderstood by these critics though, as Bono later explained, 'We weren't saying we were up with those guys, we made that record as fans, that's why we put in a picture of us looking at their posters'(something like that).  This is a must-have for any U2 fan.  This was the last U2 release of the 80s.  After this was released, and U2 concluded its &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Lovetown&quot; tours(Lovetown was simply a renamed last two legs of the &quot;Joshua Tree Tour&quot; in Australia and Ireland among other places), U2 found themselves actually bored of playing the same music every night, becoming, as drummer Larry Mullen Jr. put it, &quot;a human jukebox&quot;.  The band were united in this boredom and fatigue and general disenchantment with where they could possibly be headed, and they knew that had to make big changes, because they didn't have the joy and excitement required to make great music anymore.  As Edge put it, much later during the &quot;Elevation&quot; tour, 'When you're on tour, it has to be unpredictable.  As soon as it becomes comfortable, it's time to stop.  And we learned that lesson on the Lovetown tour'.<br />So, at one of the last shows of 1989, in Dublin, Bono made his now famous speech, saying, 'This is just the end of something for, for U2.  It's no big deal, we just have to go away for a while...and dream it all up again'.  What that led to is for a different review.  &quot;Rattle And Hum&quot; is a documentary of U2 on the path that would lead to the end of an era, and it shouldn't be missed.
B000005HLV|5.0|This what black metal is supposed to sound like: fast, chaotic and evil. Atilla has one of the most creepy and evil sounding voices on this record that I've ever heard. Favorite song: Pagan Fears.
B000000HHE|5.0|It's hard to hate on this CD.  It's impossibly euphoric, experimental in a youthful and drunken manner instead of a artistically arrogant way.  If you don't mind that EVERY OTHER TRACK IS A F---ING INTERLUDE, and there are probably less than ten full length rap songs on the entire thing, you should be able to get into the real spirit of this album.  The most interesting part of the whole thing are the cryptic symbolism of tracks like Tread Water, which show off the underplayed and unique calculated nature of De La Soul's lyrical style and subculture.  Each version of Plug Tunin', as well as Buddy (also check out the single version found on the recently released Timeless collection) are very complex bits.  This group can be very thought provoking without flaunting it, but since it can be very hard to see past the joking atmosphere of this album, many people misconstrued the constant references to daisies and thought De La Soul was not to be taken seriously.  This is obviously not the case.  Their unabashedly innovative forms, as well as the far reaching sampling sensibilites, are proof of their place in the rap hall of fame.

The story could have been told in 250 pages instead of the 400. I found myself skimming the pages and by the end, the story took on more of a science fiction aire, especially the various rescues. Not his best work.
B000000WCA|2.0|No matter how hard little kiddies may try to think not, these teen pop artists from the late 90's to the early 00's were mostly all (are) fakes. The Spice Girls were put together by a record label and hired for their looks and personalities. They don't have vocal talent whatsoever, and they were the first to admit it. A writer wrote songs for them, a DJ and music group came in and recorded the beats and tracks, all they had to do was open their mouths using their incredibely weak voices and sing the lyrics, then let the vocal purifier to the rest. It worked, and the Spice Girls, along with the Backstreet Boys proved that talent was no longer needed to make money in the music industry. So remember, if theres a cute pop star that you like their looks/personality and they have catchy songs- chances are they aren't even the ones producing and developing these songs- but its a group of writers and recorders. Just a thought...
B000001FS3|5.0|&quot;The Joshua Tree was the album U2 HAD to make, the only one they COULD make&quot;<br />Those are the words of Eamon Dunphy, author of &quot;Unforgettable Fire - The Definitive Biography of U2&quot;, on U2's process of making a new record in 1986 and early 1987.  That might sound like an over-dramatization for a rock record, but once you've heard the record, that thought goes out the window.  This record, U2's exploration of America, is one of the quintessential rock records ever recorded.  It is, varying with opinion, U2's masterpiece of masterpieces.  Since this album was recorded back when it was still 'ok' to talk about records in the context of 'sides', I will say that every song on the first 'side' of this record is a classic.  'Where The Streets Have No Name' with an intro that ranks with the best of all time, 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' with a theme of longing that anyone can relate to, 'With Or Without You'(my favorite U2 track), one of the most popular breakup songs ever, 'Bullet The Blue Sky' with its hypnotic talk/chant at the end at Edge's furious and passionate solos, and 'Running To Stand Still' with its atmosphere of deep pain being held in.  The second 'side' was comprised of lesser-known but no less mesmerizing songs: 'Red Hill Mining Town', 'In God's Country', 'Trip Through Your Wires', 'One Tree Hill', which was written for roadie Greg Carroll, who died in a motercycle wreck running an errand for U2, the dark and moody 'Exit', and the mournful and haunting ballad closer, 'Mothers Of The Disappeared'.<br />This record catapaulted U2 in a realm of superstardom seldom seen by any band.  They were not expecting it and they were taken by surprise a bit.  I own this record on vinyl, cassette, and CD, and I even have the 'Classic Albums' DVD for it.  This album has that quality about it, that sets it apart from from all other albums that don't pocess it.  What quality is that?  This was the first U2 record I ever heard, and I remember listening to it for the first time at age 13, and thinking to myself, before the album was even half over, 'hey, whoa, this band is one of the best ever'.  That's the quality.  Just like when you listen to 'Revolver' or 'Abbey Road' or any record of that quality, before it is even finished, you know the band is one of the best ever.  I was completely blown away.  It is a draining experience, one that will leave you exhausted when the album reaches its conclusion.<br />Spiritually, emotionally, lyrically, musically, commercially, U2 reached their peak with this record, and it was a peak they would remain on for a while to come, starting with the &quot;Joshua Tree Tour&quot;, their biggest tour to date at the time.  And not only did U2 reach their peak, but it is also important to note that on this record, Bono reached his peak as a singer.  For U2's whole career up to this point, he had progressively improved as a singer with each outing.  On this record he made the leap from being a very good rock singer to being one of the great rock singers of all time.  I submit he is still the best, most emotional, most evocative rock singer of his time.<br />And though that tour would eventually lead to U2 being sick and tired of their current form, and to the brink of a breakdown, that was still a good two and a half years away.  At this point U2 were excited to be as popular and relevant as they would ever be, which, incidentally gave them the leverage to pull stunts like the now legendary liquor-shop-roof-quasi-show during which the 'Where The Streets Have No Name' video was shot.  U2 had arrived.ember listening to it for the first time at age 13, and thinking to myself, before the album was even half over, 'hey, whoa, this band is one of the best ever'.  That's the quality.

B000002JOH|5.0|In the late eighties, Pantera was putting out what most would call hair or glam metal. Then came along vocalist Phil Anselmo and their thrash debut Cowboys From Hell. He still had a bit of glam left in his voice from the previous, glam/hair metal album that he debuted in, but started to develop his agressiveness. However, in this record, the thrash groove was firmly in place, Anselmo was a raging powerhouse, and the entire album was pure, raw anger. This album will make you want to break stuff, kick the **** out of someone for no reason, and get drunk until you vomit. It's sad to hear a song like Hollow now, because of the death of the great Dimebag Darrell. R.I.P.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|MYSTIC RIVER is a well made, depressing, and genuinely run-of-the-mill drama that yet again shows the wide range of crying, weeping, and sobbing SEAN PENN is always capable of.  Chock full of unsympathetic characters and predictable plot arcs, this flick is way overrated.  Which should suffice for fans of PENN, who is the most overrated actor in hollywood today.  He and the supporting cast do a decent job of bringing their characters to life, but the story doesn't give you a chance to really like any of them.  CLINT EASTWOOD's direction is assured if not inspired and the end of the picture drags on for quite some time.  Maybe I expected more from MYSTIC RIVER due to the high praise it recieved, but as a cinematic experience it's just plain there.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Well a lot of people at my school hate Alicia Keyes.I have no idea why.I think she is a great singer and can play the piano like no one else.Her songs do all sound pretty similar at least the ones im familiar with.But still she is very good and I think she can keep going for awhile
B00005J73X|2.0|On the surface Bon Jovi's &quot;One Wild Night&quot; seems like a great concept.   For starters, it's a long awaited Bon Jovi album.   The concept seems interesting - it isn't really a live album from one night's worth of performance, but rather a compilation of 16 years of Bon Jovi's live performances (The title &quot;One Wild Night&quot; actually refers to a new studio track that is included with the CD).     Although there are some good points, from an overall CD standpoint the concept doesn't work very well and this album is a disappointment.<br />By having a compilation of live songs as opposed to a live concert, the flow is disrupted.   A complete concert flow would have added a better touch and give the listener an opportunity to hear the CD as if it were concert as well as get a better Bon Jovi experience.    As for the songs themselves, one would expect a very high energy level with the performances.   After all - this is Bon Jovi and the album is &quot;One Wild Night&quot;.   I never get the impression of a &quot;party&quot; on stage at any point on this collection.    Songs such as &quot;Livin on a Prayer&quot;,  &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, and &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; are just extremely weak when comparing them to the studio versions.   It just seemed like the &quot;A&quot; game was missing when these songs were performed.   I would consider Bon Jovi's peak period in 1986-1990 (i.e. the &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; albums), yet there are no live performances from this period.   That is a shame, because we probably would have gotten a glimpse of Bon Jovi during their heyday.   Instead we get the many of the performances from 1995 and 2000 - doesn't make much sense.   The songs don't seem ordered very well either.   I don't think &quot;It's My Life&quot; is enough of a classic to open up a live performance (and that is the first track).   I also don't like &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; as the wrap up song.   Plus &quot;Livin on a Prayer&quot; and &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; are tracks 2 and 3 - so by track 4 you already have passed the 2 biggest hits from their biggest hit album (&quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;).   Finally, Bob Geldof joins Bon Jovi on stage for performance of &quot;I Don't Like Mondays&quot; from London.  &quot;I Don't Like Mondays&quot; is one of the biggest hits from Geldof's band, the Boontown Rats.  My question is - why Bob Geldof and the Boontown Rats?  I understand it was a moment from the London concert where they brought Geldof on stage, but to me - Bon Jovi's cover of this song with Geldof is not that good.   The inclusion of this song was at the expense of other Bon Jovi songs (i.e. In These Arms, Lay Your Hands on Me,  Social Disease, etc) that were left off the album.   The new song &quot;One Wild Night&quot; is pretty average - nothing special.<br />There are some positives though.   Bon Jovi does another cover - this time Neil Young's &quot;Rockin in the Free World&quot; (recorded in South Africa).   This particular cover is very good and is one place where I do feel some intensity in the performance.    The beginning chords of the song almost sounds like a U2 song, but then it bridges very nicely into a good hard rock version of the Neil Young classic.  Despite the fact &quot;Wanted or Dead Alive&quot; is included from a year 2000 performance (again a over a decade since it was released), the song doesn't seem to lose a beat.  Bon Jovi puts a &quot;western like&quot; spin on it that gives it an &quot;electric/acoustic&quot; feel to it.    &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; is the best performance on the collection.  Following &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, there are two Bon Jovi &quot;classics&quot; - &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;In and Out of Love&quot;.    These songs also have a great deal of intensity and since they were recorded on the same night (April 28, 1985) in Tokyo - that might explain it.   &quot;Runaway&quot; has a pretty good ending that could have easily been the CD's &quot;finale&quot;.<br />The liner notes are very difficult to read.  There is a nice writeup on the the Bon Jovi concert experience by Lonn Friend, but because it is written in &quot;marquis like capital letters&quot;, I find it very difficult to read.  The same holds true for the production credits.  The concert dates are actually on the back cover of the CD.  The CD has a bunch of tour like memorabilia and concert pictures.  Again, it really doesn't do much for me.   The lyrics for the new song are not included.<br />This collection is pretty good if you want to have live Bon Jovi cuts in your collection, but overall it was a major disappointment to me.   You probably aren't missing out on anything if you don't add this to your collection.
6305511055|2.0|Like probably most people who were born well after Watergate broke, I became interested in seeing this film after seeing it lumped in numerous times with other paranoid conspiracy thrillers of the era, most notably Coppola's The Conversation and Pakula's The Parallax View.  Those are two outstanding films, and Pollack's effort doesn't hold a candle to either.  This movie is a disaster.  Despite a dynamite opening act and a somewhat intriguing conclusion, together with a modicum of timeliness and poignancy with regard to real-world goings-on at the CIA, the vast majority of the film is spent slogging through dated fight choreography, awkward sex scenes, and some of the most atrocious dialogue ever committed to the silver screen.  Faye Dunaway is particularly off-putting in a muted and emotionally confusing performance as a photographer who always blathers on about metaphorical pictures she keeps hidden away and only lets some people see.  <br />Only Cliff Robertson and Max von Sydow escape unscathed from this silly, dated picture, resisting Redford's overacting and turning in fine performances (although Robertson's hair is perhaps the film's greatest mystery).  To make matters worse, the soundtrack sounds like pornography, a perfectly awful mix of xylophone and smooth jazz.<br />For a much better time, please consider The Parallax View.  If you have your heart set on Pollack, just watch The Firm, and you'll get the paranoia, the chasing and spying, and the pretty male lead, while what you sacrifice in political overtone you will gain in character development.  I really thought I had something special when I took this home to watch it; it began with such promise.  Truly it does not compare to the emotional wallop of Gene Hackman's Harry Caul, nor the mind-blowing psychadelic tension of Pakula's government coverups.  Of this trio of would-be master Seventies spy storytellers, Sidney Pollack is the odd man out.
B000001F5F|5.0|The tour accomanying U2's third LP, The War Tour, was their first really big world tour.  Towards the end of this tour, a live album and video were released.  Please note, the video is the actual 'Live From Red Rocks' show from June 5, 1983, whereas the album has SOME tracks from that show, interspersed with performances from War Tour shows in Boston and what was then West Germany.  Nontheless, it's the same songs and the same spirit.  Basically a live collection of songs from U2's first three LPS plus b-sides.  This is one of the most successful and legendary live albums in the history of recorded music, and there's a reason.  Even before U2 had the fiscal resources or the sizable back catalog required to put on huge tours like they would in the future, U2 could put on a hell of a live show, and this thing proves it.  I have it on vinyl, cassette, and CD.  If for no other reason, buy it for its versions of 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and the b-side 'Party Girl', which are virtually unbeatable.<br />This live album also served as a summation of a period for U2, though the fans did not know this at the time.  U2 were about to embark on a very different path, and this was the finale of their first, angst-punk, period.
B000062YAZ|5.0|While Spiritual Black Dimensions may be the greatest black metal release, this is the best thrash album ever created. Not a single record I've heard has yet to match the speed, intensity and chaotic feeling of this record. It's so fast, the whole thing only clocks in at around 20 minutes. Favorite song: Postmortem.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is their best release since Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.  It is a great comeback from the godawful Iowa cd. That album was terrible.  Slipknot finally drop the boring, 1 riff songs that Iowa had and return to the level of experimentation and technicality they had with MFKR. All 9 members shine on this album. Corey's vocals have improved quite a bit. The guitar solos on this album are incredible (they sound a lot like Death Metal solos). You can actually hear Paul's bass sometimes on this one. And the drumming, as always, is top notch. There is absolutely no rapping on this album, which is a big plus.<br />My favorite songs on here are Three Nil and Welcome because they are the heaviest. Joey does hyperblasting on Three Nil, which makes up for the song not having a guitar solo.  The acoustic songs are pretty good too. They still have the Slipknot atmosphere to them and kind of remind me of Opeth.<br />This album surpasses Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is an amazing CD for anyone who loves rock music. Brandon Boyd has an incredible voice and the lyrics are really powerful. Incubus' style of music is unique so they stand out from other bands. <br />Don't pass up this CD. If you're not into heavy metal and don't like bands that are just pop rock, you should try Incubus. And definitely listen to their other CD's- each Incubus CD is different. <br />great band + brilliant singer = amazing music
B00003CX5P|3.0|Jedi master Qui-Gonn Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), encounter young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) while aiding Queen Amidala's (Nathalie Portman) attempt to break a crippling trade blockade on her planet.  They take the future Darth Vader under their wing, setting the stage for future tragedy.  Clearly, the universe is about to be plunged into war.  <br />The state-of-the-art special effects provide plenty to look at, but otherwise there is little to recommend this film.  The roles are underdeveloped with the result that the cast, which is packed with fine actors, come across as dull because they have nothing to do.  I realize that this film is not primarily about characterization, but just think back to the main characters of the original trilogy--Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia--and how much fun it was to watch them interact.  Was that because Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher are better actors than anyone in &quot;Phantom Menace?&quot; No, it's because those characters had some fire in them.  The characters in this movie just seem to be rushing from scene to scene.<br />When you've got the resources that writer-director George Lucas has to produce a bang-up action flick, you can pretty much guarantee a certain level of satisfaction if you just let the story build its momentum and stay out of its way.  A film with great special effects that just allows itself to be spectacular without derailing itself can pretty much count on getting at least 4 stars from me.  However, just as he did with the Ewoks in &quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; Lucas has introduced a character and a race so annoying that I groaned inwardly every time they appeared on screen.  I haven't seen &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; yet, but the prospect of having Jar Jar Binks and the Gunguns inflicted on me again doesn't make me feel any sense of urgency to do so.
B000001EAQ|5.0|With the massive &quot;ZooTV&quot; tour and record-combo of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and &quot;Zooropa&quot; behind them, the attitude as U2  re-convined in 1995 for a work on a new record was decidedly progressive: they would continue to push the envelope  as far as they could musically, technologically, and conceptually.  Because of technological aspect of it, this  was U2's hardest record to produce.  It took so long to complete that it went into what was supposed to have been  tour rehearsal time(for the new &quot;Popmart Tour&quot;, which was to be bigger and more massive than even &quot;ZooTV&quot;).  As a  result they were not ready when the tour started in Las Vegas.  More importantly, the string of critical success  that U2 had going back to the late 80s finally came to an end in 1997 when &quot;Pop&quot; was released, as the reviews were  very lukewarm, even poor.  U2 were disappointed with its sales...and the fact that &quot;Pop&quot; sold 6,000,000 copies  should tell you something about their standards.  <br />U2's peak was over, but I will forever hold that this record was unfairly criticized just because it was so  different from everything U2 did before it, but that's a staple of U2's career: change.  'Do You Feel Loved', 'If  God Will Send His Angels', 'Staring At The Sun', 'Last Night On Earth', 'Gone', 'If You Wear That Velvet Dress',  and 'Please' are just great songs.  Also standing out is the closer, a song of desperation and despair, 'Wake Up  Dead Man'.  This album may have seemed about lemons and arches and colors and videos making fun of the village  people(the opener, 'Discotheque') and all fun and games on the outside, but in reality the lyrics of this record are the most serious and cynical of U2's career.  Not many people realize that 'Staring At The Sun' is a political song, describing how suits and ties can be just as deadly as soldiers with guns.  'Please' is as serious as it gets lyric-wise: &quot;And love is big, bigger than us, but love is not, what you're thinking of&quot;.<br />U2 did a lot to help this record by putting out some great performances of its songs, especially 'Staring At The  Sun' and 'Please', including a emotion-high show in Sarajevo, the first rock show their since their war ended.   But towards the end of the tour, it became obvious that they had gone as far as they could in the direction  started in Berlin in 1990.  They felt the need to tone everything down and just be four guys in a band again.   This first came to the public's eyes in the form of old songs that hadn't been performed in a long time, showing  up in the setlists of the later &quot;Popmart&quot; shows, such as &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;.  The public would soon get a more  blatent show of this change of direction, but unfortunately, it would also leave this album in the dust.  Vastly  underrated and underappreciated, this is still a very good record.

6305603847|5.0|I have owned this film on VHS for many years, so I was not in a big rush to buy the DVD...but I'm sure glad I did ! This is one of the rare instances where a movie complements the music instead of diminishing it (unlike Quadrophenia, for example...)<br />This is one film that I can't stop watching - once it starts I'm hooked until the end. The 90 minutes really fly by. And to those who say the real life and animation do not comfortably coexist - I say &quot;rubbish !&quot; the transitions are smooth and seamless. My favorite part is when the school kids, with their faceless masks, are marched through the factory and into the grinder. Classic Pink Floyd. And I say Bob Geldof's portrayal of Pink is flawless. Buy this DVD - you won't regret it !
B000001FA4|5.0|In their offtime between the 'War Tour' and the recording of &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, U2 saw an exhibit in Japan about Hiroshima, which subsequently led to many of the ideas and images throughout this album.  For this album, U2 let go of producer Steve Lillywhite, who had been at the helm of the group's first three records, and hired duo Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois(pronounced Len-Wa), a move that would pay off in more ways than U2 ever could have imagined when they made it.  Eno and Lanios created a much more polished, atmospheric sound for and with the band, and it was quite apparent right from the opening chords of the record.  To quote bassist Adam Clayton, on the transition between the end of the previous tour and this record, &quot;It was either the end of something, or the beginning of something else...and The Unforgettable Fire was that new beginning&quot;.  <br />The castle on the record's cover(NOT, contrary to popular belief, Slane Castle) is very indicitive of the relaxed and wintry feel of this record.  It's very quiet yet very loud at the same time.  Highlights include anthem classic &quot;Pride(In The Name Of Love)&quot;, the title track(which also happens to be one of the more orchestral tracks in U2's catalog), &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, live classic &quot;Bad&quot;, the opener, &quot;A Sort Of Homecoming&quot;, &quot;Indian Summer Sky&quot;, and the closer, &quot;MLK&quot;, which is a rather comforting yet heartbreaking song about death(MLK's in particular).  This is a great and even magical record in its own right, it went perhaps deeper musically, it was perhaps more sophisticated, than anything U2 had done before it, U2's second masterpiece if you ask me, yet it is still only a prelude, by most standards, to what comes next.
079284131X|4.0|Good little movie. A fresh approach to horror and what a great job. <br />A seriall killer puts his soul into a doll when he is killed and when he comes back, the only person he can put his soul into is the 1st person he tells that hes a real person, and its a 6 year old boy. Chucky starts to kill and no one belives Andy as he is targeted as the killer. More people are killed and Andy is to blame until his mother discovers that chucky has been talking and walking without any batteries...<br />this movie, although its really good, is a slow mover and can get boring but its well worth it and is very entertaining and enjoyable and scary. Plus, the little foul mouthed doll is hilarious!
B000002GQH|5.0|To correct another reviewer (Alan Caylow) this is The Moody Blues' FOURTH Album...NOT third.<br />Now onto the music.  The album is chock full of airy tones that make for enjoyable and relaxing music.  <br />Highlights for me include Lovely To See You Again, Never Comes A Day, the Jethro Tullish sounding So Deep Into You, and Send Me No Wine.  The rest of it is very good as well -- offering up that music that only The Moody Blues can offer.<br />Sit back, relax and take a journey with The Moody Blues...On A Threshold Of A Dream!!<br />A+

B0001BKAEY|2.0|Just like so many third acts in film trilogies, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS loses the plot. Squandering a great opportunity for a satisfying conclusion while simultaneously destroying the original idea by nullifying the importance of the first. That's quite an accomplishment. Suffering from a lousy script, acting that threatens to redefine the term 'wooden' and so many frustrating Freudian overtones that it boggles the mind, one seriously now wonders if this whole idea was actually conceived as a three-part actioner rather than commercially-based money grabbing sequels tacked on to the first. RELOADED was a lame attempt at pretending it was a film on its own. We all knew it was merely two-hour exposition paving the way for REVOLUTIONS with a couple of half-decent action scenes thrown in. And it stank worse than Batman And Robin. However, with all that talk leading up to something, you would be right in assuming that the third film, like Lord Of The Rings was the ultimate payoff. Nope. Peter Jackson can actually direct and get good performances from his actors. Keanau Reeves' Neo gets more and more stilted and morose every minute, and the new supporting cast that were introduced in the second film are wasted in thankless roles here. There is less Oracle/Architect gibberish this time around, but that doesn't help much.<br />Regardless. the action should've made up its flaws. Note really; the battle of Zion is initially impressive and the CG is good, but it loses impact after some annoying overkill and suffers VERY badly from the oft-rumored 'battle fatigues' problem that is absent from STAR WARS and LOTR. All adding up to a distinctly naff trilogy that also tarnishes the first film. Shame on you Wazowskis. Booo!

0316666343|1.0|So I was another of the millions who felt the simply MUST read this book, if just to keep a toe in the zeitgeist.  So many people, including friends I respect, loved it.  By the end of it, I was thinking if maybe I should be rethinking my relationships.  This was the worst book I have read in a long, long time.  Hackneyed prose, hackneyed characters, nothing to redeem it whatsoever.  <br />And it could have been so good!  There was the potential here for a sort of murder mystery from heaven,  the potential to explore our questions about What Comes After and the devastation of those left behind in a new and intriguing way.  But the author gave us nothing but a premise unfulfilled, a pack of palliative lies, and some of the worse writing about sex to come down the pike in years.<br />Alice Seabold is rich, rich beyond her wildest dreams - good for her.  Don't feel you need to contribute.
1565123875|4.0|In Purple Hibiscus, we listen to the plaintive voice of Kambili, whose skill at language does not extend to the spoken word, as those necessary words remain trapped in her throat, a girl who knows her place and keeps her silence. In Kambili's family, there are too many things \\"we never talk about\\". Growing up in the political upheaval of Nigeria, Kambili and her older brother, Jaja, are poster children for domestic violence, quiet, well-mannered, high achievers that their father points to with pride, \\"his\\" children: extensions of himself in the world. A generous man, beloved in their village, only Eugene Achike's nuclear family suffers his rages behind closed doors.<br />Jaja's emotions are closer to the surface, more accessible to his spirit of rebellion. But Kambili is her mother's daughter, cautious, constrained and eager to please. Her slow awakening is all the more significant because of the tremendous act of will necessary to break free of her conditioning. This experience is agonizing for Kambili, like the prickling of a limb that has fallen asleep. Her adolescent physical and emotional flowering enhanced by newly found self-expression and self-awareness, Kambili is a product of a world that leaves children unprotected, at the mercy of a merciless man. She is the observer, the reporter, emotionless as she describes the constant abuse. Like a sieve, Kambili filters every action, sorting, learning.<br />Eugene passes on the lessons he has learned in his own childhood, taught by brutal Catholic missionaries who used temporal punishment; the abused is the abuser. Rigid religious instruction, intolerant and unforgiving, is the tool with which this man terrorizes his wife and children. His wife is trapped by her husband's frequent beatings, but the children glean a different way of life in the home of their Aunty Ifeoma. A widow with three children, Aunty Ifeoma exists in borderline poverty, but teaches her children without dehumanizing them. Exposure to this loving family opens Kambili's heart, planting the seed of hope and the promise of a future that offers more than pain and self-discipline.<br />This powerful, yet subtle novel is striking on two levels: one is the subjection of society to the tyranny of the chaos that results from a political coup; the second is the role of family in the formation of children's lives, contrasting a monstrous discipline with the guidance of loving relatives. The political unrest and subsequent difficulties of daily survival are the canvas against which the author defines her young characters, especially significant because of the helplessness of a population ruled by intimidation.<br />In this exotic African setting, the author shares cultural differences, rituals and beliefs. She does so with great skill, describing luxury and poverty alike, the discrepancies of an unequal society. Adichie knows the language of the abused child and speaks simply, directly to her audience. Her native land is Nigeria, but this dialect is universal. She understands that to be heard, one must speak softly. Adichie garners an audience of survivors who respond to personal empowerment, wrapped in hope.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I just finished watching Band of Brothers on the History Channel and was absolutely stunned. I knew that it was highly acclaimed, but the reviews don't so it justice. If you want a glimpse into the real life stories of the men who freed the world and defeated a true evil, this is the best DVD around.<br />Band of Brothers combines the realism of Saving Private Ryan while getting into far more detail. The rigorous training, the camaraderie that they felt, even their distancing themselves from new recruits to avoid getting attached to guys who they likely would see dead, all speak to the realism of this portrayal of WW II. Unlike any war prior, WW II was mainly a squad level war with a couple dozen soldiers on each side fighting it out rather than massive waves of men and Ambrose selected just the right size of outfit and the right people to profile.<br />Perhaps just as telling is the lack of traditional heroes. The men who served in Easy Company were no angels or John Wayne types, just regular Joe's from all over America who heard the call and served their country. None of them wanted to be there but they had a job to do and in those days you just did what you had to do. The men of Easy Company went a step further and volunteered to jump out of airplanes for some reason. I had a history professor in college, a diminutive old man who looked like he wouldn't hurt a fly, who was a volunteer for the glider corps. He told us he did it to impress girls!<br />What I found most poignant were the introductions by veterans and the stories of their lives after they returned from Europe. One veteran recounted that some young men he knew from his home town were rejected from service due to medical conditions, and were so distraught at not being able to serve that they committed suicide. It is hard in modern day America to imagine that anything could stir up our population with that sort of single-mindedness, given that we already are complaining about steps to combat terrorism as being too intrusive (like being in a collapsing building brought down by terrorists is preferential to having to wait in line to get to your gate at the airport). When the men returned home, they went back to living their lives grateful to be alive and back in America. It is a shame that the accomplishments of these heroes have only recently been given due respect with a memorial in D.C.m as being too intrusive (like being in a collapsing building brought down by terrorists is preferential to having to wait in line to get to your gate at the airport). When the men returned home, they went back to living their lives grateful to be alive and back in America. It is a shame that the accomplishments of these heroes have only recently been given due respect with a memorial in D.C.
0060930349|5.0|This book is simply the best book I have ever read on American history.  Paul Johnson's writing style and unsurpassed grasp of research into demographic, political, religious, cultural, military and economic areas is woven into a masterful summary of the people and personalities which have shaped American history.<br />The narrative moves seemlessly from one important influence and time period to the next, challenging myths and legends of the founders and foundations of the American Republic and debunking current myths about recent political leaders.<br />America's uniqe culture and history and important place on the world stage is shown to be a result of the special culture of individual responsibliity and moral and religious underpinnings.<br />This book has driven me to buy and read the rest of Mr. Johnson's works.<br />If you buy one book on American history, is should be this one.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I've read the first 50 reviews of &quot;Smallville&quot; with great interest and amusement.  Happily, I was able to enjoy<BR>&quot;Smallville&quot; from the very first episode (which &quot;hooked<BR>me,&quot; as one writer noted).  Having recently retired from teaching<BR>philosophy and logic courses at a nearby college (I'm 74 years<BR>young}, I think that qualifies me as having a mature intellect<BR>(certainly beyond the 12-30 age range}.  I have always enjoyed fantasy and have a large collection of science fiction and fantasy pulp magazines (comics too!) although my main reading over the last 40 years has been science, evolution, and the Philosophy of Religion and the Philosophy of Science.  <br />I'm not ashamed to admit that I have enjoyed the first three seasons of &quot;Smallville,&quot; which touched the youngster in me.  I agree with the writer who said that the series got noticeably better after the first season.  I'm going to buy all of the seasons (if the third season is released on DVD}.

B000069CWE|5.0|I just read over on LinkinPark.com, that Mike has some ideas for redoing a couple (not the whole CD) of the songs from Meteora and releasing them. not much is known, but that would be cool, because I loved Meteora (even though a lot of people trashed it because it wasn't the same LP from before) and I would love to hear it remixed. Hybrid Theory was an amazing album before Reanimation, this CD just made it better. I mean if you hate electronica and rap, then I suggest you stay away, because that is what you will get here. <br />This CD is for hardcore LP fans. Plus if you bought the Pankake Festival DVD and listened to the audio only tracks the remix for One Step Closer is on here, just a little shorter. <br />For those of you who are into underground rap and stuff, some of your favorite artists may have worked on this CD!

0575073225|4.0|I inherited this book from a friend of mine who moved to England, and I must say, I wish I'd read it earlier. At first, the levels of violence were a bit of a turn-off (I'm not keen on massive gun-laden stories), but the society inside this Sci-Fi novel is just so interesting and well-crafted, I forgave the violence to enjoy it.<br />In this future world, everyone is implanted at birth with a &quot;stack,&quot; a chip in the back of neck that keeps your memory and personality on file. If you're murdered, and the stack survives, you're &quot;re-sleeved&quot; into another body (synthetic or not) to testify at your trial. Die of old age? Buy a new sleeve, if you can afford it. The amount of &quot;fallout&quot; in this society due to this technology was astounding, and plausible, and done extremely well by Morgan.<br />At it's heart, this story is a murder mystery, and a story of revenge: someone kills a centuries old &quot;Meth,&quot; (Methuselah), who, dutifully backed up every eight hours, comes back, but with no real idea of what happened in those eight hours to lead to his murder, and quite curious about it, and that Meth hires our hero to figure things out. Our hero of the tale is actually a criminal serving time in a virtual jail (his body is, of course, given to someone who needs it more), and he is beamed to earth from his own colony when the Meth hires him. Wearing someone else's body (which has a fallout of its own), the narrator of the tale tries to figure out who would try to kill a man who'd lived centuries, and why...<br />Between religious and spiritual reasons, hatreds, rivalries, and plain-old-jealousies, there are no shortages of potential murderers, and the tale spins wonderfully. I highly suggest it.<br />'Nathan

B000148KK2|3.0|I am a fan no doubt of Diana.  Her Live in Paris album was so refreshing after her schmoopy, syrupy string fests of the prior two albums that she got back to playing and interpreting mostly uptempo standards and pop tunes.  That is her meat and potatoes and her piano self-accompaniment and soloing is superior when the producers let her play. This album explores original material and new moods.  I would characterize many of the original numbers as falling in a sort of brooding, contemplative almost melancholy style. It isn't Peel Me a Grape and it isn't I've Got you Under My Skin either. I can't fault the lyrics because I always ignore them, no matter who wrote them. Is it my favorite album of hers no, but it is something new to ponder and has it grown on me since the first listen?  Yes.  Will it become my favorite? not likely.  But it is certainly not the disaster others have made it out to be.
0684833395|5.0|I rad this book as a Junior in high school a year ago and has convinced that it was quite possibly the best book ever. It has a dry yet witty sense of humor and its many characters and a diverse spread. All of the characters are different in there own way and make you smile. True the book does take a dark twist about 3/4 the way through but the end inspires us with the everpresent idea of hope, peace, and resolution.
B00003CXDG|1.0|I would have given this movie more stars if Tom Cruise wasn't present in it, and Richard Roxburgh would have done a one man show. The scenes with Roxburgh, and only the scenes with Roxburgh was what kept me alive during the film. Although when that stupid Tom Cruise killed Roxburgh's character the movie ended right there. The scene was when he switched their faces, and I thought Roxburgh's character had beaten the crap out of Cruise's character and they killed him and I was feeling quite happy for the moment, until, they pulled the face off of Cruise and it was Roxburgh instead. I was DREADFULLY upset. And then it showed Roxburgh running, but it was really Cruise since he hadn't pulled off his face yet. He should've left Roxburghs face on (at least he would've looked better), and then he ripped his face off and it was Tom Cruise, thus the movie ends.

B0001ZX0OM|5.0|(...)<br />MYSTIC RIVER plays like a modern day Greek tragedy, full of pathos, remorse, guilt, failure in love, etc.  Brian Helgeland is to be commended for his faithful adaptation of Dennis Lehane's brilliant book.  Clint Eastwood is to be commended for his superb direction, getting remarkable performances from his outstanding cast.  Those who didn't like this movie probably aren't the kind who like a slower moving film, and one that can ultimately only end tragically, with no resolutions firmly established.  I found it to be a moving, disturbing film, one that would have won more Oscars had it not been up against the Lord of the Rings Return of the King.  Apples and oranges...those two films are so different it's hard to compare their excellences.  While The Return of the King is a fantastic film, MYSTIC RIVER is equally impressive but for different reasons.<br />Sean Penn, Cinema's ultimate bad boy, brings a depth to the character of Jimmy Markham that I would not have imagined.  Overacting?  How can a parent not over-react to the terrible tragedy of losing his oldest daughter.  Penn shows the inner torment, the guilt of having spent time in prison and losing his wife, and trying to discover his daughter.  A man who is a devout Catholic, ironically has chosen a life of crime to support his family.  Penn devastates with his performance and deserved his Oscar, hands down.<br />Tim Robbins as Dave is likewise brilliant and he too deserved his supporting Oscar.  His scene with his wife in discussing vampirism and how he likens it to his life is chilling.  \\"Sometimes it gets in you, and you can't get rid of it.\\"  The devastating effects of his childhood abduction have shaped his life, and shamed him enough that he won't tell the truth about where he was on the night of Katie's murder.<br />Kevin Bacon, one of our most underappreciated actors, shines in his role as Sean, the third of the boyhood friends, who as a homicide detective has to confront old pains in finding out who killed Penn's daughter.  His own failed marriage is exemplified in the telephone conversations with his wife who won't even talk to him.  Bacon deserved a nomination, but his role isn't quite as showy as the other two.<br />Oscar winner and nominee Marcia Gay Harden is heartbreaking as Robbins' wife who finds herself confused at her husband's behavior and the blood on his body the night of Katie's murder.  Her ultimate fear and confession to Penn leads to tragedy.  Harden's scene where she waves frantically to her young son in the final parade scene is heartbreaking.<br />Laura Linney, one of our finest actresses, shines in the role of Annabeth, Jimmy's supportive and ambitious wife.  She deserved a nomination but again since her role wasn't too flashy and she didn't have a lot of screen time, she was overlooked.  But feast in Linney's talent in the scene where she tells Jimmy he could be king and rule their world.  Her own agenda and ambition are coldly captured, and Linney is superb in conveying that.<br />Also excellent in smaller roles are Thomas Guiry as Brandon, the boyfriend of Katie, who was going to run off with her to Las Vegas, and Laurence Fishburne as Bacon's cynical hardboiled partner.<br />The entire cast is perfect, and the movie packs an emotional wallop rarely captured in today's youth-oriented cinema.<br />MYSTIC RIVER is a cinematic experience of immeasurable power, and does justice to a most exceptional novel.

B00025ETIW|5.0|Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is by far one of the best albums of 2004. The screaming has been toned down but this does not mean that the quality has decreased. The lyrics are powerful and the sound created by the band is beautiful. Gerard Way's amazing vocals are complimented quite nicely by Frank Iero and Ray Toro's phenomonal quitar riffs, Mikey Way's wonderful talent on the bass, and Matt Pellisier's awesome drumming. This Sophomore effort was done quite nicely and is a must hear for fans of any genre.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|This album is so many things at once it's hard to keep up. It's one of Dylan's most important albums, because it shows him shifting from folk to rock; it represents a point where his breathtaking creativity was hitting its stride; and it is, moment for moment, one of his best albums--some would argue, musically, it presents the most representative picture of his work of any disc.<br />Thank goodness the remastering process has given us this revelatory new recording of such a classic. The new clarity of the sound allows the deceptively simple complexity of the instrumentation on the album to shine, and Dylan's voice is shocking. He doesn't just deliver the lyrics--he's actually singing! Many Dylan recordings did his work, and his voice, little justice, but the original transfer of Bringing It All Back Home was among the worst. If you only buy one of the 15 new remastered hybrid super audio CDs, this is the one to get. From the subversive opening notes of &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; to the quiet closing strains of &quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,&quot; this album is a gem not only of artistic genius but of the power of a dedicated remastering effort.
0452282152|4.0|In her novel, 'Girl With a Pearl Earring', Tracy Chevalier gives clever voice and life to the enigmatic subject of Johannes Vermeer's incomparable oil painting of the same name.  For protestant Griet, just 16 years old and forced into service as a maid due to her family's poverty, the very Catholic household of the famous Delft artist bears little ressemblance to her life as the daughter of a tile painter.  Although assailed by mountains of laundry and other monotonous and never-ending kitchen duties, she nevertheless has the acute perception of an artist's daughter to notice the odd dynamics that bind the inhabitants of the household together as deftly as Vermeer's brushwork depicts the light shining on the face of one of his models.  &quot;He&quot; as Griet awefully refers to Vermeer, lives only for his painting; his mother-in-law agrees to any of his whims to insure a faster end-product with happier patrons and hence more revenue to keep the household from slipping into financial ruin.  His wife, Katerina, desperately wants to be a part of the world Vermeer sees with his painter's eye; she smoulders pettishly when she realizes that Griet is admitted into his world wordlessly as Vermeer recognizes something within Griet that defines her as a kindred spirit.<br /><br />Chevalier fills the novel with the tasks of an everyday Delft so real, one marvels at the magnificence of her invention.  Her simple concentration on Griet's cleanliness; the whitness of her cap, the studied way in which she wears it with the two ties hanging on either side of her face to hide her expression, reminds us of the Biblical maxim &quot;Cleanliness is next to Godliness.&quot;  Yet, the author ingeniously uses this bit of clothing and its accompanying characteristics to display Griet's dual nature: a Protestant girl who wears her snow white cap fears gossip in the marketplace and frowns upon what she calls &quot;Catholic art&quot; displayed in the Vermeer home and a girl with unruly hair that needs hiding within the cap's entrapment hints at an equally inruly spirit that would not hesitate to go into the alley with the handsome butcher's son and have him grope under her wanton skirts.<br /><br />Chevalier paints a lovely portrait of a young girl's resignation to a live the limited life to which she is born yet to live again in innocence, beauty and expectation forever captured within the medium of canvas, paint and linseed oil.<br /><br />I thorougly enjoyed this novel.  I listened to it on unabridged audio and never once was I bored at the simple straighforward narrative told in Griet's controlled voice.  Here the love affair takes place in the world of canvas; so if you are expecting romantic fireworks set in a skyrocketing July 4th tableau, forget it.  This novel concentrates on a full spectrum of emotions that burn underneath the skin with the steadfastness of an eternal candle rather than the &quot;appearances-be-damned&quot;, &quot;no-holes-barred&quot; passions that are snuffed out after carnal lusts are spent.eeds hiding within the cap's entrapment hints at an equally inruly spirit that would not hesitate to go into the alley with the handsome butcher's son and have him grope under her wanton skirts.  <BR><BR>Chevalier paints a lovely portrait of a young girl's resignation to a live the limited life to which she is born yet to live again in innocence, beauty and expectation forever captured within the medium of canvas, paint and linseed oil.  <BR><BR>I thorougly enjoyed this novel.

0156027321|5.0|The shape of the narrative in this highly entertaining and readable novel is basically determined by a pair of Japanese insurance adjusters. These gentlemen do not believe the narrator's account of how he survived after his ship sank, so to get rid of them he tells another, totally different and much more prosaic, version. It seems to me that a very good joke is being played on anyone who worries about which is the `true' narrative. This is fiction for goodness sake - none of it ever happened.<br />The main account is remarkable for being made to sound as convincing as the author manages to do. Purely as a story, it is perhaps a little more likely than The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and I was very conscious, in a thoroughly enjoyable way, of being manipulated and played with by the author. I know a certain amount about animal behaviour just through being interested in the subject. However my knowledge is strictly that of a dilettante and amateur, and the author's grasp of the matter is either greater than mine (which I can easily believe) or he is able to pass it off as greater than it is to someone possessed of my level of knowledge. In terms of credibility, the origin of the tiger's name is perfectly believable but if a reader can accept how the narrator came to be named as he was then that reader ought to be able to swallow more or less anything that follows. It is all just a tale - a very clever, original and absorbing tale - as far as I can discern, not an allegory like Gulliver's Travels nor carrying a moral like the Ancient Mariner.<br />The other main thread is the narrator's interest in religions - plural. He is something more than ecumenical in his tastes, and he values the world's various faiths for the level of edification they bring him. He seems not to be interested in what factual truth, if any, there may be in their legends and doctrines, but I was heartened, as well as being slightly taken aback, by his placid assertion of what has long seemed obvious to me, namely that atheism is a more honest and reputable viewpoint than agnosticism. When I was inclined at times to wonder what the connexion might be between the religious thread and the principal narrative, it seemed to me that it was perhaps to be sought in an imaginative disregard for anything so prosaic as fact.<br />All thoroughly enjoyable and recommendable so far as I'm concerned. If you have not so far read the book, my recommendation is not to take the slightest notice of anything you may have seen about the relative truth of the two alternative stories. The truth is neither here nor there.bvious to me, namely that atheism is a more honest and reputable viewpoint than agnosticism.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of those movies you've always heard about but never saw.  Here's why:<br />Donnie Darko is about a young man in high school who sleepwalks at night, just in time to avoid a jet engine smashing through his bedroom.<br />Right around September 11, 2001.<br />So Donnie Darko, like the titular character of the same name, disappeared with nary a trace.  Fortunately, we now have a DVD version and there will be a new theatrical re-release of a director's cut of the film in July, 2004. Perhaps Donnie will still get his day.<br />Donnie Darko is about the Darko family.  They're an average family, with an older sister heading for college (Elizabeth, played by Jake's real life sister Maggie), a cute-as-a-button younger sister (Samantha, played by Daveigh Chase), a white-collar mom and dad (Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne), and then there's Donnie.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie as an alternately awkward, exhausted, strung out teenager who exhibits brief flashes of rage at the inanity of modern life.  Donnie also suffers from a troubled past, a past that requires him to see a therapist and take medication.<br />Donnie's life is a textbook troubled soul on the road to nowhere.  We could easily see him committing suicide, getting involved in drugs, getting some girl pregnant, maybe joining a gang, or even shooting up his school.  All's the pity, because Donnie is also extremely bright and has a piercing wit that embarrasses adults.<br />All that changes when Frank shows up.  Who's Frank, you ask?  Why, Frank's a deranged bunny rabbit.<br />That's a simplification, of course.  To be precise, Frank is a deranged being in a bunny rabbit suit.  The distinction matters.<br />In fact, in Donnie Darko, EVERYTHING matters.  Every word, every nuance, like an Edgar Allen Poe poem, has significance and meaning.  Ironically, the director and writer, Richard Kelly, feels the movie has only one interpretation as a science fiction story.  In spite of himself, Kelly has created a movie that alternately weeps at the desperate loneliness of so many humans living next to each other and exults in the sheer joy of existence.<br />Frank whispers suggestions to Donnie, things that, at least on the surface, seem like very bad things to do.  Donnie, in his sleepwalking, always performs these acts of vandalism.  And each time, Frank tells Donnie how much he has left before the world ends.  He starts the film with 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Screen shots remind us that the end of the world is coming in a manner similar to The Ring (which came out in 2002, one year after Donnie Darko).<br />Reality lurks in the background.  No one can explain where the jet engine came from.  Government agents shadow Donnie's every step.  In the mean time, town life goes on: Samantha's dance group gets discovered by an agent, a self-help guru (played by Patrick Swayze) spreads his mind-numbing spiritual pap, a book gets banned by the conservative elements for fear that it influences students to commit vandalism, bullies make fun of kids, teenagers do drugs and fool around...in other words, it's a microcosm of Everytown, USA.<br />All around him, Donnie's life slowly falls apart even as it starts to make sense.  Each person in his life is challenged by their mediocrity and must face whether to rise above or succumb to their fears.  The movie emphasizes the madness of putting &quot;Fear&quot; and &quot;Love as diametrically opposed elements, emphasizing that the world is never that simple and often involves a mixture of the two.  It also struggles with the issue of God's existence, of personal choice vs. destiny, of life and death, of madness vs. sanity, and more.<br />Drew Barrymore stars as an English teacher who attempts to open the student's minds.

0131103628|5.0|This book is short and sweet. It gets straight to the point by keeping it simple(unlike many programming books that just wander off into the back woods talking about some complex programs when its trying to explain a simple syntac). I recommend this book along with C Primer Plus, then C unleashed if you wish to contiune that far down the beaten path.
0060012218|1.0|The reason I ask the question in the title is because this book has so much melodrama and unrealistic characterizations that it would fit snugly into the annals of bad fanfiction on the Internet. The protagonist, Russel, approaches the level of a Gary Stu. For those of you who do not know what a Gary Stu is: a Gary Stu is the male equivalent of a Mary Sue, a name commonly attributed to characters who are just THERE for the readers to like--smart, funny, good-looking...heck, a bunch of wonderful qualities all rolled up into one insufferable make-the-reader-fall-in-love-with-him character. Heck, the author, Brent Hartinger, pretty much gives away the fact that Russel is a Gary Stu, since he says in a Q&A on his website that he has given Russel all of his good traits and none of his (Hartinger's) bad ones in an attempt to make him likeable. Russel is not a complete Gary Stu, however, as he does have a few faults--namely, when he does not speak up in favor of Brian Bund, the high school outcast. So I guess we can say that Russel is a bit of a coward. BUT...the sentiment in creating Russel (taken straight from Hartinger's words) is definitely that of a Gary Stu. <br />Min is also a Gary Stu (er, make that Mary Sue). She is smart, witty, AND she sticks up for the underdog and Brian Bund. What's there not to like? (the reviewer says sarcastically). And poor Gunnar? Well...I guess Gunnar got stuck with the leftovers. <br />In addition, the writing overall in the book is too stock and cliche. The exposition is labored and obvious and the prose is stilted. The reactions by characters are melodramatic. I know, when you're in high school things do take on a certain melodrama...but this was going TOO far. The characterizations of some of the \\"evil\\" characters were too one-sided. I think it would have been interesting to see, say, one of the adults who disapproved do something else that cast him in a more flattering light. After all, thing are rarely black and white (in terms ofpeople being completely good or completely bad). But I guess Hartinger was too blinded by his own beliefs that he couldn't write about anybody who disagreed as anything other than bumbling, stupid, and bad. I'm not saying that I disagreed with his views...however, his writing about the whole portrayal of the reverend was so completely obvious (read: not subtle) that I felt like I was being hit on the head over and over. I thought: ENOUGH ALREADY. I GET YOUR POINT. Hartinger needs to learn to write from a more neutral perspective instead of forcing his own views down readers' throats. Or at least to make his writing more palatable first.
6305428387|5.0|Bobsled to a Caribbean is like a Yeti to the Sahara desert. Both simply dont exist!. And yet, 4 guys with dreams in their eyes, set out to acheive the unmaginable in the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. To represent their country Jamaica in Bobsledding!.<br />         &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; is based on this true story, but with a few changes that needless to say, is aimed at making the movie more dramatic. Leon(Derice Bannock)is an athlete aimed at making amends for his failure to secure a berth in the Jamaican Sprint Team. With no way out, he decides to try Bobsled, a sport no Caribbean in his right mind would even know it exists. Irv Blitzer(John Candy), a disgraced former champion Bobsledder decides to train Leon the intricacies of this &quot;bone-shattering&quot; sport. To compete in the event would however require 3 more bobsledders to make up the team. In comes his best friend Sanka(Doug.E.Doug), the tempermental Yul Brenner(Malik Yoba) and the reserved Junior Bevil(Rawle Lewis). What you end up with is a team of hysterical proportions, but with a heart.<br />         &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; is not so much about the event as it is with the main characters. The Jamaicans are determined to compete in an event that is considered solely the domain of a few Icelandic- Nordic nations. The 4 guys are felt out of place, racialized and ridiculed at the event while the coach(Candy) is humiliated and taunted at every turn by the organizers. The crux lays in how they overcome their hardships and ultimately win the crowd, if not a medal. The movie is absolutely hilarious considering the Jamaicans have never seen snow in real life. The initial training on their island is itself worth every penny you paid to watch this movie. However the movie's main strength is in its moral message. &quot;Believe&quot;. The movie is based entirely on this one word.<br />         Leon is superb in his role as the leader who never gives up. John Candy is without doubt an actor with a heartof gold. Every movie he has been involved in, he brings in that 'human element' into picture. He is perfect as the flawed but determined coach. The find of the movie however, is Rawle Lewis as Junior Beville. He has the best dialogues and behind that meek physique ,stands a truly compassionate and competitive character. Sanka is the funny bone whose expressions are enough to spill your guts out while Yul Brenner is a tough but protective fellow who eventually warms up to the team and gets transformed at the end of the event. Ultimately it is the will and the confidence they derive from each other at every turn of the event that makes this movie so heart-warming.<br />         The movie has a nice flow to it and the music is catchy. Jon Tutletaub(Director) puts everyting in the right place and the direction is straight forward but slick. Though some parts of the movie are fictionalized, it is forgivable since the main theme isn't lost. Infact it actually enhances it. I must say that movies like this generally tend to have a predictable ending. You'll know you'll have a happy one at that. But watch Cool Running's final few scenes and the phrase 'finish the race' will take a whole new meaning to you. The ending is inspiring..surprising..simply magnificent. Go watch it.
B000000WA2|4.0|My favorite albums are the ones that have themes/messages/moods with which I can identify.  On this album, Blur explores the despair and loneliness of the white collar scene, a group which appears happy and prosperous but suffers thru as much anxiety and unfulfillment as anyone else (albiet the nature of the suffering is different from worrying about paying the bills on time or whether or not there will be enough $$$ to put food on the table). This one definitely falls into that category, because I am a member of the white collar crowd, working a job that pays well and requires long hours but is ultimately unsatisfying.  Even the production style plays a part in conveying this theme- the sound is very full and glossy but hides lyrics of sadness and lonliness.  I wonder how Damon Albarn was able to capture this sentiment so accurately when I don't think he has ever had a real job;)  Also, the playing is great as always, Graham Coxon is a terrific guitar player in particular.  He always knows the appropriate note/riff/chord to play in order to achieve maximum emotion and drama.  Anyway, I think music should inspire emotions in the listener, whether positive or negative, and this album definitely succeeds on that front.<br />Also, I admire Blur for being a band that is not afraid to explore new themes, try new styles, defy expectations, and take risks.  They do all of these things on every album, and more often than not succeed in making very dramatic and satisfying art.  This album falls into this classification.  There are a few missteps but in general it is powerful stuff.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|A must have!<br />Too bad I'm poor because I would fly to NY right away to go see 'Wicked'. What so entertaining of this musical is that we get to see the side of the 'bad guy' or 'bad girl' in this case. When we judge someone or something, we need to look at it from the bad person's side of view. <br />After the Tony awards was broadcasted on TV, I knew I had to get the CD. Idina Menzel's performance of &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; blew me away. I just can't stop listening to it and sing with it at the same time. My other favourite tracks have to be &quot;What is this feeling?&quot;, &quot;Popular&quot;, and &quot;No good deed&quot;. Stephen Schwartz's orchestration is amazing and witty (Sorry, but I have to say the lyrics are a little cheesey sometimes). Kristin Chenoweth is perfectly for the role of Glinda. Just by listening to her attitude and singing through her tone of voice, she sounds just like the Glinda in the movie 'Wizard of Oz'. I still think Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel should both receive a Tony for their roles.  I really wish the 'Wicked' cast would come up to Toronto for a show or two, I bet it'll be sold out for sure.<br />Time to go 'defy gravity'!
B00008NRLX|4.0|While it seems a little silly to compare rock bands like sports teams, one listen will make you realize that these guys are top notch.  It is impossible for even the most jaded listener to not be affected by the drama created by good songwriting such as this.  The Jayhawks have an ability to conjure up emotions in the me that not many groups can... it makes me reminisce about happy times and events in my past.  This not their best album and there are a few clunkers, but the gems vastly outweigh any mistakes, and even operating at 90% of full capacity, they are head and shoulders above their rock/pop/alt-country peers.  Groups like this need our support!
B0000630BT|5.0|And of course i still am.  I mean it was 4 years removed from that drudious Turbo and 2 years later from Ram it Down, which wasn't too bad but this jump here is what sealed the deal for the return...until Rob decided hey i'm just gonna leave you guys and split.  <br />Track listing:<br />1. Pain Killer: 5/5 if this self titled track isn't enough to prove the jump was a good one then you need a kick in the @$$.  This one kills from start to finish.<br />2. Hell Patrol: 4/5 Simple yet affective track which lends it's self to speed metal sounds and great piercing screams from Rob.<br />3. All Guns Blazing- 4/5 After the weird introduction this song ain't too bad really...would i lie?<br />4. Leather Rebel- 4/5 Perhaps the title was driving home a point from the guys in leather after all.<br />5. Metal Meltdown- 5/5 Simply put: KILL!  THIS SONG MAKES BATISTA SMASH!<br />6. Night Crawler- 6/5 Most impressive work of a song and they should be proud of it: the lyrics for once ain't too bad and the intro and middle parts are terrific!<br />7. Between the Hammer and the Anvil- 4/5 Anvil is hard, the hamemr is harder, but the track is the hardest!<br />8. Touch of Evil- 3/5 Pretty good but it took me longer to get this song into my system then the rest.<br />9. battle of Hymn- 4/5 See the other 4/5's because the bill fits this one as well.<br />10. One shot at Glory- 5.5/5 Terrific ending track reminscint of a time when Priest rode higher, like per say the British Steel era by chance, and caps a great orginal cd.<br />11 and 12: i heard the original and own the orginal and not the re-mastered one so i cannot comment here: sorry.<br />Overall: 5.3/5 This CD applauded a long climb back in 4 years time from Turbo, and with Scott Travis drumming there was a noticable difference, but the band would go into obscurity for 7 years after Halford left the band announced...HE WAS GAY!  Not that this chances my opinion: perfernce does not change my opinion of his singing abilites.  GreatCD and definately killed the pain of the downhill slide for JP!
0385512104|5.0|&quot;I am in a special needs school, but everyone has special needs&quot;, so says Christopher, an autistic teenager who goes to a school for &quot;special&quot; kids but despite his condition is bent on solving the brutal killing of a neighbor's dog.<br />No, this innocent detective work doesn't turn into a wild goose chase as in your typical detective novel, there is no bevy of ulterior motives, suspects and thrills. Indeed that wouldn't be possible because our little sleuth in this case is someone suffering from Asperger's syndrome.<br />We are instead presented with the world, the &quot;case&quot;, the life from his point of view. And this is the marvellous aspect of the book because the simple yet clever perspectives are riveting.<br />For instance, the boy does not believe metaphors. Metaphors are a way of talking about things in a way that they aren't, so metaphors are basically lies -- you laughed your socks off, it's raining cats and dogs, you are the apple of my eye. Can an apple fit into an eye? At the heart of Christopher's predicament is betrayal. His mother leaves his father. His father betrays him. He simply says, &quot;Why can't you love me? Why can't you be straight?&quot;<br />One one level, our little detective is mentally challenged but on another he is a terrific observer. His dislike for lies about the events he is recounting and his aversion to emotionalizing his observations lend the story a stripped-down precision that enables the author to talk about the big issues of love, mortality, loss, betrayal without sounding contrived.<br />What a brilliant debut from Mark Haddon. I feared I would be treading on a tripwire of sympathy-bombs when I bought the book, but it's a moving, fast-paced read with a very intriguing &quot;plot&quot; that is not burdened by finding proofs and criminals, but by tossing up the absurdities and lies of our lives.<br />Highly recommended, for almost anyone in your family who can read.
B00000IL67|5.0|This is the best box set I have ever owned, and it blows the usual sets out of the water.  It contains 12 songs that can only be found in this collection, and lots of songs from albums that cannot be found on cd anymore.  For example, it has 4 songs from the album Muscle of Love, and now that album cannot be found on cd.  Then, there are 3 songs from the first two albums Pretties for You and Easy Action, and even the most hardcore fan will have a hard time finding these songs or records anywhere else.  <BR>    It also contains a great book that has quotes from Alice Cooper and other members of the band about each song, and why they wrote it, and there are great pictures, and his complete discography up to when the set was made.<BR>    I was hessitant on buying this set and instead thought about buying the albums individually, but I ended up buying the box set, and liked everything, and ended up getting the albums too, and don't regret ever getting the box set.  It does a great job of mixing rare tracks with classic songs like &quot;I'm Eighteen&quot; and &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;.  And the rare songs are good too, not like some of those b-sides you're dying to hear, then end up understanding quickly why they didn't make the album.<BR>    Some of the cooleset tracks found only on this are:  &quot;Lay Down and Die, Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Nobody Likes Me&quot; (the studio version) and He's Back (the Man Behind the Mask).
B000148KK2|4.0|This is an album of Diana's interpretation of some very hip tunes.  It's not high stress (or high energy), and it doesn't deserve any questions as to &quot;authenticity&quot;.  Diana plays and sings so well, and so effortlessly, that it's easy to take shots at her for not creating another &quot;Paris&quot; album.  But that's not what &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; is all about.  This album is meticulously crafted, smothly produced, with first class musicianship from both Diana and her sidemen.  The licks are classic, the vocal stylings are laid back, and her intonation is right on the money.  She starts the album with a Mose Alison tune.   That takes confidence, and guts.  Dig it.
B000002MP2|5.0|In the ninetees, things were looking bleak, musically speaking. Rock had oficially been replaced by sub-standared hip-hop and techno-pop. The boybands were taking over, and popular music was generally... sh*t. Pure bullsh*t. But in the time of darkness, as always, there were heroes. The most notable, of course, was Nirvana, who gave the world Nevermind when we needed it most. Green Day came a close second with 1994's Dookie, a brilliant, even heroic, punk-pop record that seemed to channel the spirit of Joey Ramone himself (I think he was alive at the time, but that's not really important).<BR>Dookie was great because it rekindled a love for the punk of old, the stuff of the Ramones and the Buzzcocks and the Undertones, that had seemed so long gone in those dark days of '94. But Green Day didn't just borrow old styles. They were innovators too, adding their own special brand of pop savvy, giving their songs an almost maddening catchiness. Naturally, the band became an overnight success, making millions in the process. They diserved every penny.<BR>And it's not just the legendary slacker anthem \\"Longview,\\" or the surprisingly touching ballad \\"When I Come Around\\" that give the album it's magic. Every single song is an instant gem.<BR>The first song, \\"Burnout,\\" for example, kicks off the album with a powerhouse drumbeat, along with a light speed, three power-chord guitar riff, and the catchiest sing-along lyrics this side of... the next song on the album. Halfway through \\"Burnout,\\" drummer Tre Cool shows off his skills with three hyper mini-solos.<BR>\\"Burnout\\" is so powerful that I actually had to stop and take a deep breath when the song was over.<BR>The next song, \\"Having a Blast\\" doesn't let up the intensity. With an instantly memorable chorus and Tragi-comedy lyrics, Dookie's second song is probably the greatest non-hit on the album.<BR>Dookie progresses through twelve more songs, never letting up in terms of fun, speed, catchiness, or intensity. It is a must-have for anyone who misses 1977.
B0001VWP8I|4.0|Most of the songs on this album are very good, but just to name a few.....<br />-  Left Outside Alone // One of my 2 favourites from this album and the first single. It starts of with a slow intro, and it eventually turns into a pop-rock song<br />Lyrics: 95%  Music: 98%  Originality/Creativity: 100%<br />= 97.5%<br /><br />-  Time // This is my absolute favourite. It starts of like a ballad (Anastacia sings the Ooooos and everything), and when it comes to the chorus it is very rockish!<br />Lyrics: 100%  Music: 99%  Originalty/Creativity: 100%<br />= 99.6%<br /><br />-  Where Do I Belong // My third favourite. It is a ballad, but still, it is a good song. (Anastacia doesn't seem the time to sing ballads does she?<br />Lyrics: 94%  Music: 97%  Originality/Creativity: 91%<br />= 94%<br /><br />Therefore, this is not a bad album, a few more songs, better artwork in the album booklet would be good, but regardless it is very good - and I don't really like track 9 \\"Sexy Single\\" it is just a bit too corny for me.<br />83%
B000148KK2|1.0|I bought this CD a few weeks ago when it was first released because I was had been so enchanted with the voice of Diana Krall... and on the strength of those performances I figured I had a winner here. Not so. On playing this album for the first time, I think I just felt like I had just thrown 15 bucks out the window. <br />I read the very mixed reviews of Ms. Krall on this site tonight, and realized I am not alone when I say this is new CD is far below what this talented woman can actually do. I am all for an artist &quot;trying&quot; something new.... and Diana &quot;tries&quot; to sing songs in a style that is not her own (sure sounds like she is &quot;trying&quot; to sing like Norah Jones) and she has &quot;tried&quot; to write songs with her husband Elvis Costello, and they are (by any standard) poorly written and her performance is as jazzy and as captivating as Perry Como used to be .... this CD will put you to sleep faster than any Muzak will. Don't take my word for it... listen to the samples here.<br />I noticed this album, as of this writing, is the number 8 on Amazon's best seller list. While this may sound pretty good to her management and Verve records, it should also be noted that of the TOP 100 best selling CD's, this album ties with only one other album (Eric Clampton's) with the WORST overall rating at 3 stars out of 5. <br />I sure hope Diana will come back to her own unique style when she is finished &quot;trying&quot; out new ways to simulate other singers and emulate other styles. I also am for her singing totally new songs.... as long as she hires an exciting and dynamic song writer to write them for her. We still have great songs being written by Burt Bacharach, Dolly Parton, and a host of others. Until then, I will look elsewhere for music that speaks to me.
B00005NGAK|3.0|I own Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, and Feet of Flames.  I Must say Feet of Flames was a waste of money, Thank goodness it was a gift. <BR>If you own Lord of the Dance, Don't bother buying Feet of Flames! Its the same show, Yes there's a few differences there.<BR>1) its an outdoor concert, 2) 2 New Songs/Dances, and thats pretty much about it. <BR>I really think they lost what they were trying to achive.
B0000AFX64|3.0|I had a copy of this on VHS until only a week ago (by the time this is posted) when I bought a copy the DVD box set.  As said above this is good to wet your appetite for the series, but you would be better off spending your money for the box set.  The first thing you notice about this version of the series pilot is its running time.  The pilot originally ran 3 hrs with commercials, so this is obviously missing at best 30 minutes of valuable footage.  The next thing you notice is the endline of Patrick Macnee's (who did the voice of Imperious Leader and later played Count Iblis in the 2 part episode &quot;War of The Gods&quot;) narration after the credits: &quot;Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man who even now fight to survive, far away among the stars&quot; (the original line is &quot;somewhere beyond the heavens&quot;).  Finally, the last time you see Baltar, the Imperious Leader has  him put to death, and anyone who knows the series knows in the end he spares him, hence the events that happen in the series.  So realistically this film is ok, for a few showing, but you are much better off buying the box set and seeing this episode (televised as &quot;Saga of A Star World&quot;) the way it was meant to be seen.

B0000A118M|4.0|Acknowledgement? Resolution? Pursuance? Psalm?  Why didn't he just make it all one song and call it &quot;Crazy&quot; instead?  Thats what it is. It's an hour of Coltrane going just absolutely bonkers on tenor sax.  Of course that's what Coltrane does anyway, but he's just in outer space on this record. He mangles and twists the hell out of his horn in modal and chromatic spasms and sometimes will just wail on one or two notes or non-notes like like he's screaming into the the thing. Meanwhile, the piano player just puches and plunks and slams and rolls all over the place, while the drummer whangs around and smashes and farts and trips over everything then goes crazy in long billowing solos.  Ever so often some clunking and deranged spectre of a melody comes stomping in like a zombie and crashes around a bit, but it always goes back to the same jumbled and dissonant freak-out that makes up most of the recording.  Most of the time it sounds like there is no real rythym at all, much less structure, which is cool, I suppose, if it's done right--and it is. I give this record a completely arbitrary four stars since I just like the way it sounds and I don't know how to possibly rate it! This is way out there if you dig that kind of thing. It's free. One would almost think Coltrane pioneered this style if he didn't know better.

B00024BHTC|4.0|This is one of two albums by Nightwish which I have not given five stars. Instead of waiting for the June 22nd American and Australian release dates, I imported this and Xandria's 'Ravenheart' from Amazon.de where I paid about $25AUS just for shipping. I have to say that it was a disappointment when I finally got the CDs. It is the most anticipated release from Nightwish reaching the no.2 position on Amazon.de and has done quite well here too, but I have to ask myself why they are getting such positive reviews. This album is but a mere candle in comparison with Wishmaster and Oceanborn. I absolutely HATED Century Child and while I like Once much more than Century Child, I still feel that Nightwish is weakening. If you are new to Nightwish, this album is DEFINATELY NOT for you. The fisrt weakness is in Tarja's voice. In Wishmaster an Oceanborn, Tarja's voice is powerful and in contrast with the modern rock instruments, it gives Nightwish her unique sound. Once is much more classical and Tarja does not really stand out from the music (except in Nemo). I, personally, did not really enjoy the orchestral aspects for most of the part. I feel that this album could almost be taken out of the 'metal' section and placed in the 'classical' section at times. Tarja's vocals were thrown in with a choir most of the time and the band was overthrown by the orchestra. I bought this album thinking that the songs would be as good as Nemo but , instead, all the songs sounded like Planet Hell. The first track has very little Tarja vocals and more choir vocals, a trend which continues for most of the album. On a good note, those of you who hate the male vocals will be slightly happier.

Now, Grisham ventures into an arena that encompasses his love of the law and his comprehension of real life.  As I read The Last Juror, I saw how brilliantly the author wove a tapesty of life in the South, using the thread of the trial to hold the fabric together.  I found it beautiful and I hope everyone who reads it appreciates the story within the story and can understand life in the South, even as it exists today.
0790732254|5.0|I have to make a hazardous statement and I really hope you to think carefully about the fact that somehow, Mike Nichols and Artur Penn were two american film makers powerful influenced by European directors.<br />If you agree with this , I would say that Mike Nichols has had a clear influence in his first stage of his brilliant career of Ingmar Bergman. Think for instance in three excellent future films of Nichols (Four easy pieces , Carnal knowledge and Black widow)<br />This long introduction is necessary for understand the weird presence of a dark and even bitter film like Who's afraid...<br />The film undoubtly has deep roots related with two important films of the swedish director like The silence and The hour of the wolf.<br />This comment doesn't deserve a bit about the great level of this magnificent picture.<br />First at all, watch for the resource economy . The film runs at night hours and with two locations .<br />Two very different couples, one of them extremely young almost teenagers , and in the other side a midle aged marriage. He's a patetic man , extremely weak character (Richard Burton) and she is the unsatisfied woman , and domains the relationship in every little detail.<br />The meeting with this young couple will allow to Elizabeth Taylor exhibit her monumental skills for acting and give a tour de force performance , that became in her well deserved Second Academy Award.<br />The script is extraordinary. The dialogues are pregnant of crude realism , the horror, the multiple facets of a woman who has kept in silence so many dissapointments , the countless consequences as result of a poor comunication , the anguish of her about knowing and being the axis of the relationship.<br />And this is the ocassion for her to eject her most hidden thoughts ; she exploits like a earthquake , literally without a drop of prudence with all the violence that you can imagine and even more , the past phantoms emerge from the deepest dark shadows of her soul .<br />The hopeless, the loneliness , the sense of going nowhere and however not be able to separate instead the inferno in which she lives.<br />All this micro universe exploits before us and you feel its impact and the tragedy.<br />That film is a challenge for any director in any age, but Nichols is a master who besides had the presence of these two  giants actors as Taylor and Burton. The house and the garden are the silent background in which this disgraced marriage reveals its intimacies before the young marriage.<br />You'll be disturbed but plenty of admiration by this splendid work .<br />A timeless masterpiece .<br />(With this film Nichols became the first director to reach the one million dollars by this picture.)<br />Excellent transfer to DVD.loneliness , the sense of going nowhere and however not be able to separate instead the inferno in which she lives.<BR>All this micro universe exploits before us and you feel its impact and the tragedy. <BR>That film is a challenge for any director in any age, but Nichols is a master who besides had the presence of these two  giants actors as Taylor and Burton.

B000002HJD|5.0|Like Lennon and Hendrix, Jim Morrison was one of the figures that shaped rock, and unfortunately, these men died way to young. This collection of poetry is deep and beautiful and the music behind Jim while he is talking really sets the mood. The live version of &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; fits this collection perfectly and is nice to listen to. Pick this up if you like the Doors, Jim, or like poetry.

B00002Z88D|4.0|This album provides a neat twist to some of Metallica's best songs.  Some of the songs arn't performed up to par with others, but I still like this album.  Double disc.. Another reason to by this album.  You get your money's worth.  And the couple new songs on this 2 disc collection.. Well, No Leaf Clover is awsome, this song had me so hooked.  But Minus Human isn't really a very good song, it's sort of plain.  It doesn't have the normal Metallica vibe to it.  Well, this album still made it's way into my daily life, and for any Metallica fan, no matter how soft/hard core you are, deserves a listen.
0380778556|5.0|I've been familiar with the story of &quot;Rebecca&quot; for what seems to be most of my life; I've watched the screen version numerous times, but only recently got around to reading the novel.  Even though I knew what was going to happen, Daphne Du Maurier still managed to keep me on my toes.  Only the greatest of suspense writers can do that.<br />&quot;Rebecca&quot; tells the tale of a young woman, without family connections, who finds herself falling in love with and agreeing to marry the widowed Maximillian DeWinter.  She becomes the &quot;second&quot; Mrs. DeWinter and must adjust to life at Manderley, the estate that Maxim owns (and, where he also lived with his first wife).  A shy and naive girl of nineteen, Mrs. DeWinter is unable to cope with the splendor and magnitude of life at Manderley.  She constantly feels that everyone is watching her and judging her; but most importantly of all, comparing her to Rebecca, the first Mrs. DeWinter.  She is also convinced that just as much as she loves her husband, he is still that much in love with his first wife.  This mindset is enhanced and complicated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (possibly one of the very best literary villians ever) who keeps Rebecca's rooms intact, as if she were about to walk through the door at any moment.  She terrorizes our narrator with her tales of Rebecca and how much Maxim loved her and Mrs. DeWinter believes all of Mrs. Danvers stories.<br />The past finally has to be confronted when Rebecca's body turns up in her sailboat, buried at the bottom of the sea.  The ghost that has hung over their precarious marriage finally &quot;comes to life&quot; to haunt them.  Du Maurier brings her novel to a thrilling conclusion, (even though the story technically begins after the novel's story has come to an end).  The characters are vividly written and one feels the reach of Rebecca's deviousness just as much as Mrs. DeWinter does.  And when it's all over, you want to read it again.

B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Man, it takes me such effort to sit down to watch a movie.  When I sat to watch this, I found it sooooo enjoyable!!  You do not want to even pause it, which I constantly do with movies.  This movie is a good movie.  Well done in the acting department.  Very well done Eastwood!!  You feel like you are watching a Soprano movie.

0767020308|5.0|This movie is far superior to the one starring Gwyneth Paltrow.  Kate Beckinsdale gives the part of Emma a greater depth of character than Ms. Paltrow does...and a great deal more fire and attitude - as Emma should have.  Character development in this version is much better than in the Miramax version.  Ms. Beckinsdale's Emma is much more lovable and understandable than Ms. Paltrow's.  In the end, this makes the audience symphathetic to Emma - she deserves this.  Remember, she is only a child, still finding her place in society.<br />The scene on Box Hill is played quite brilliantly in this version - Emma, you must remember, is very naive and is not really aware of what she is doing.  You get a better sense of her blunder and of her remorse in this version than in the Miramax version, in which she seems to be nasty on purpose.<br />The casting (and acting) in this version is superb - Jane in the Miramax version is saucier than one would expect; her expressions were much harsher than author Jane Austen may have wanted.<br />A nice nod to the Pride and Prejudice version - the inclusion of Ms. Lucy Robinson (Mrs. Hurst in P&amp;P) in Emma as Mrs. Elton was a great choice.  She makes a wonderful, loud, brassy wife.<br />If you must insist on watching the Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow, watch that version first, and then watch this version.  Otherwise, you will be very disappointed.

B00000G3AZ|2.0|Ugh!  Paltrow's Emma is cruel and spiteful...it is really hard to feel any symphathy for her; author Jane Austen's Emma deserves much more than this.<br />Character development falls very short in this movie.  Paltrow's Emma is not consistent - she is sweet in one second, spoiled the next, thoughtful one moment, and thoughtless the next.  This Emma has no conscience - she does not learn from her mistakes, which is crucial to the entire story!  Check out A&amp;E's Emma, starring Kate Beckinsdale - she does Emma a great deal more justice than does Ms. Paltrow.<br />This becomes most obvious in the scene on Box Hill.  In this version, Emma is nasty to Miss Bates...and on purpose.  You have to remember that Emma is very naive and not really aware of what she is doing.  In the A&amp;E version, you get a better sense of her blunder and of her remorse.<br />The only good thing in this film is Mr. Knightley - he is quite playful.  Every other character is ridiculous...perhaps this is because the director has to force us to like Paltrow's Emma.<br />This is a very inaccurate adaptation of Austen's beloved book, and a poor portrayal of her most brilliant, charming female lead.  Of all Austen's character's, Emma is the one who grows the most.  In this movie, she falls far short of growth - no growth of character, no growth in society...nothing.<br />If you must insist on watching the Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow, watch it, but then do the wise thing...WATCH A&amp;E's VERSION!  Otherwise, you will deprive yourself of a truly great interpretation of Emma.
B00007ELEL|5.0|this movie is simply amazing.<br />i first saw it after noticing that it was part of my brother's dvd collection, and that it was made by the coen brothers whose previous movie (fargo) i really enjoyed. well, the big lebowski far surpassed fargo. It's true that a lot of people won't \\"get\\" this movie...but for those who do, it's simply brilliant. This is one of those rare films that doesn't have to conciously make jokes to be funny (if it didn't want to), but is just hilarious in its atmosphere alone. This is a film capable of making you laugh with its smallest nuances, expertly crafted dialogue, even points when none of the actors are actually speaking (see John Goodman's facial expression after \\"Jesus\\"'s rant about flashing a piece out on the lanes). The casting is dead-on, with Bridges and goodman giving absolutely flawless performances and Turturro, Buscemi and Moore with solid supporting roles. Combine that with very good integration of music within the story and you have a stoner cult film that will give you many happy repeated viewings, even if you aren't a bum, stoner or hippy. And finally, just because I can't help it, my favorite lines...\\"well that's just like, your opinion, man\\"...\\"no, i mind...the dude minds...this aggression will not stand man\\" and of course, \\"new s*** has come to light!!\\"

B000002GB6|5.0|This album made Chuck Mangione a celebrity. Although Chuck made albums just as good as this one since about 1972, the hit single, Feel So Good introduced him to the public. Chuck did have hits before this like Bellevia, but Feel So Good was a winner! This cd starts off with the the long version of Feel So Good. On the edited version and radio version, the trumpet intro was cut, Chris Vadala's tenor sax solo was cut, and guitarist Grant Geissman's first solo was used half way through, followed by the other half of his second solo. Also, one of the melody phrases was taken and doubled in length while they faded the song out. The second song here is the underrated, Maui Waui which was never preformed by Mangione at concerts and on records ever again. Don't know why, it's a great song! It sounds like some love story commercial or something. Mangione always had a way of writing his music and making you feel like you were somewhere or something. The third tune, Theme From Side Street, was also never preformed by the Mangione band ever again. It's a cute little tune with a great hook and spots for Grant and Chris to solo. Hide And Seek, is a funny little tune. My dad was always humming this song, after I would blast it downstairs where my stereo was. It's got wild solos by Grant and Chris. During the solos, you'd think you were listening to Led Zeplin! That's how outrageous it is! Last Dance is a ten minute song, you kind of want to end, but do enjoy hearing. It has nothing to do with that disco song of the same name. The last tune is the song that made drummer James Bradley Jr. a legend around drumming circles. Although his drum solo in this particular version was kind of tame,  he would take it at a more lightning speed on live preformances. Bassist Charles Meeks also gets a little jazz bass solo here. This is one of the best tracks on the album. If you never heard Chuck Mangione's records, this is a good place to start! I love this album and so would anyone else, who knows good jazz!
B0000CD5FN|5.0|I am just so happy that Joe Strummer was able to get this album completed after his untimely death.  STREETCORE is a classic that rivals his esteemable work with the Clash.  Though basically a rag tag collection of demos and unfinished tracks, the Mescalero's pitched in to finish off what Strummer had started to great effect.  This is a remarkably consistant album considering it's origins.<br />All tracks are of excellent quality with the rocking COMA GIRL, GET DOWN MOSES and ARMS ALOFT leading the way. STREETS ARE BURNING successfully revisits an earlier Clash anthem and MIDNIGHT JAM is an revelation, that perhaps could have pointed a way towards future recording. Covers of Marley's REDEMPTION SONG and Bobby Charles' SILVER AND GOLD are especially touching given the context.<br />Strummer seemed to lose his muse with the disolving of the Clash and wandered for the better part of two decades before finding himself again by recording with the Mescaleros.  Although it's certainly sad to see him go so soon after restarting his career, STREETCORE provides an apt coda to a great musical career and a great life.
B000001E7T|5.0|i am a huge fan of &quot; rid of me&quot;, so i was a bit suprised that i liked this cd.  In fact, the only song on this cd that retains the raw power of PJ Harvey's earlier works, is the title track. That may be because this track displays her characteristically new barbed-wire voice more than any other track on this cd.  While listening to this song, you can imagine a deranged psychotic woman, walking from the dust of the desert to the front of your tv screen, with saliva oozing down her mouth, and her eyes bloodshoot, and no, shes not on weed.  Despite all the creepiness, this title track is catchy and captivating, thanks, in part to the organ and e-bow.<br />  however, the fun does not end there.  throughout all the tracks, harvey displays an excellent sense of imagery that was never diplayed in her earlier works.  &quot; I think im a mother&quot; has to be one of the creeepiest tracks in memory.<br />  Although to bring you my love  may not be &quot; rid of me&quot;, the beauty of the tracks makes this cd a winner in its own right.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|In the late 70's, Disco ruled the airwaves. Punk was coming in, and some so called NEW WAVE was making its debut. THEN, out of no where, a young guitar player named Eddie Van Halen played an instamental called Eruption, and set the music world upside down ever since. This album is a  timeless classic. From the opening of Eruption, to Atomic Punk, it just KICKS (...)! This one saved rock-n-roll back then. It still sounds just as fresh and awesome as it did back in 78. (...)
0345404475|4.0|After being an ardent Blade Runner fan for years, I decided to explore it's roots in Philip K. Dick's book, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\". The movie and the book had less in common than I'd expected, particularly with the character development.  Unlike Blade Runner, there is nothing at all redeeming about the personalities of the replicants/ \\"andys\\" in this book, which has an even more chilling effect. There are, however, plenty of interesting ideas here, and depicting \\"authentic\\" animals as the ultimate status symbol is definitely intriguing. What interested me the most, were the marital issues between Deckard and his wife Iran. The love scene between Rachel and Deckard here is curiously shallow, adding to the isolated tone of the book.<br />Philip K. Dick is a good writer, effectively permeating the book with an unrelenting anxiety and cruel irony. PKD's ideas came to fruition in Blade Runner, but this is the blueprint, and therefore an absolute must for Blade Runner enthusiasts.
B000002KZA|4.0|This is in response to mind traveler...You should check out Recoil, then compare it to Depeche Mode now... You mention you hate this album out of all of them...but then you mention you hated Ultra and Exciter...the albums that Alan wasn't on... For he made their sound more full and interesting... with the piano and strings and deep analog bass... back in the day Alan was the only one that had any musical talent in the band... and the other band members admited it... Violater, and Love, Faith, Devotion was most influenced by Alan... You should check your facts better...
B000000OQF|5.0|This is HANDS DOWN the best album released in the 1980's!  This is a fact, and if you can't deal with it, then too f*cking bad!  Most other glam rock bands (hell, most music in general) during the 80's were a complete and utter joke.  However, Axel Rose and crew proved that they CAN play (if you wanna sit here and tell me that the guitar solos on this album are easy, then you are a dumba** and have no sense of talent!).  I will admit that Axel's voice isn't for everyone, but he is much more talented than most lame-a** one star and two star reviewers want to give him credit for.  I like modern music (some of it, anyway) as well, hell, I'm only 19, but this ablum is still simply awesome!  Oh, and one more thing.  To the reviewer(s) who said that it is a sin to compare these guys to the gods that Led Zeppelin are, I will say this: Led Zeppelin are NOT GODS!!!  No band to this date has ever done anything that would merit them god-like status; stick your heads outta your asses, people!!  I won't deny that they have (or had) an enormous amount of talent, but GN'R are, without a hint of doubt, comparable to Led Zeppelin.  Infact, I strongly believe that GN'Rs play more complicated solos on both drums and guitar than Zepp.  There, I said it!  If you don't like it, too damn bad!!!  You can say that Zepp is better than GN'R; that I understand.  However, to say that GN'R isn't even comparable to the &quot;greatness that is Led Zeppelin&quot; simply shows your ignorance, and I figured I'd state my opinion to shove a little bit of the anger back in your faces that you ignorant reviewers have been shoving at me for so long!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I wrote a review earlier bashing Love,Actually. I honestly do not know what I was thinking, I must've been in a crabby mood that day or sumthin', because after another re-watch, I was absolutely delighted by this warm hearted, charming romantic comedy, that, like most romantic comedies leaves you feeling good afterwards.It takes on a few too many characters, and some of the scenarios are a bit improbable; but then again, what romantic comedy isn't guilty of this?As far as the acting goes, it is fantastic across the board.For me, I felt that Emma Thompson stole the show.She has a really beautiful scene set to a sad Joni Mitchell song in which she's all alone in a room on Christmas morning, and she's just found out her husband(Alan Rickman) is having an affair.The scene is wordless, but Thompson breaks your heart.<br />It would've been nice to get rid of some little sub-plots, and spend some more time with the main characters.The film would've been exceptional if Curtis had done so.But alas, I'll settle for this very charming romantic comedy, that strikes all the right chords and is totally entertaining to watch throughout.While it follows the formula of every other romantic movie out there, there is a humanity,honesty, and realness found here that I have yet to discover in other romantic films.

B00001IVOR|3.0|This album was pretty good; it didn't seem to me that they were falling off at all. But I do know why this album was kinda considered as a sophomore-jinxed album. First, it's very hard to top 36 Chambers, as it was their breakthrough album. So once you broke through, what more is there to do? Either keep doing you or experiment with some different sounds, which is what RZA was doing with more soulful samples and singers like Tekitha (remember her?). Fans expected more of the kung-fu samples to dominate the album. Second, can someone say the word, &quot;OVERKILL&quot;? I don't care how much of a Wu fanatic you are, there are nine members in the group, plus CappaDonna and their other Wu extended family like Poppa Wu, all on over two hours of material. It's too much of a good thing, like having Burger King for seven days straight. Last, only Disc 2 is the most memorable with songs like &quot;Triumph&quot;, &quot;Heaterz&quot; and &quot;M.G.M.&quot;. Disc 1 is okay, not wack, but okay. To tell you the truth, I only played this album for much of 1997, but when newer albums came out, this one got lost in the shuffle.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Tim Burton has become the master of the fantasy film from &quot;Batman&quot; to &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; but now he has turned his attention to a story of depth and emotion. Anyone who one day woke up and discovered that they didn't really understand their father, or know his life story will love this movie. As the film progresses we are invited along a journey of discovery, that of a son learning who his father is, and learning to see past all the &quot;Big Fish&quot; stories. Anyone expecting another cartoonish tale from Burton will be disappointed in this film, but anyone who ever lived with or knew a spinner of big tales will love this story. I recommend it for anyone who ever wondered who their father really is, or just love a story with both depth and multiple layers.
0060005424|5.0|I found this book to be one of the best books I have ever read! At fist I found it hard to actually get into it - as I hadn't read Sabriel, but once you get into, WOW!

0780626966|5.0|This is one of the greats of horror movies there have ever been. With one of the most infamous killers ever. Freddy Kruegar. These films represent his story...<br />Nightmare on elm street - This is by far the best on the series. Freddy looks very dark in this one, and this is probably the one were he is the most violent. Robert England plays him so well. It can be shocking at times, but not scary. Lots of disturbing and strange scenes too.<br />Nightmare on elm street 2: Freddy's revenge - A lot of people really hated this film because it messed with the original story. Robert Englund reprises his role as Freddy. It is set in the same area, but this isn't a film with nightmares. It starts off as a nightmare film, but at the end this is a normal slasher. That's why people didn't like it. Still, I still like it, and it contains so much more gore.<br />Nightmare on elm street 3: Dream warriors - This is the one that made the second look like it didn't exsist. This one follows from the first, not the second. Many people enjoyed this one, as I did. Robert Englund is back, and so is Heather Lagnekamp (played the main character from the first film). The story concentrates on a group of teenagers this time, and their nightmares, and Freddy is back again, invading their nightmares. This one is probably the most fun, since Freddy gives us better and more creative death scenes, like the puppet scene (SICK!). This one isn't set on Elm street though, it's a hospital, but it has  good atmosphere. An enjoyable entry.<br />Nightmare on elm street 4: Dream master - This was a dissapointing sequel, which I also didn't like. Freddy loses his touch in this film. It can also be very stupid at times, and the deaths are -- creative -- but very OTT. The gore is the same (OTT). It does continue from the third, but the leads who survived in the third don't survive for long in this one, and it changes to another story. This is quite a bad entry to the series I think.<br />Nightmare on elm street 5: Dream child - This is very much the same to the fourth, but this is the worst in the series. The film doesn't concentrate enough on Freddy, but instead it's his mom. Freddy's one-liners are very cheesey and crap, and there aren'r enough deaths in this one. This one concentrates more on Freddy's past. Shame, 'cause the opening of this is quite scary.<br />Freddy's dead: The final nightmare - People also don't like this one, the consider it to be more funny than scary - which it is, but it's a really good film. It opens up quite satisfyingly, and the film also gives us information on Freddy, before he became a killer. This is the only elm street film where he doesn't use his claw to kill someone, but he kills people in a cool, fun way. I like this entry, certainly an improvement to the lat tow films.<br />Wes Craven's new nightmare - I actually like this film. It's all about Freddy in the &quot;real&quot; world. Many roles from the original movie star in this and play themselves, as this film is like a docusoup. Once you get to the last thirty minutes of this film you'll love it. But, Freddy isn't in much of the start of this film, and it has a story that can be quite hard to follow. Other than that, this is an excellent film, and it's a great and different way to end the series.<br />A classic horror series that must be bought.
B00004W221|4.0|My Four Star rating reflects both overall enjoyment while seeing the film (Five Stars) and occasional irritation with director Anspaugh's manipulative strategies insofar as emotions are concerned (Three Stars). The dramatic impact of Rudy Ruettiger's struggles to suit up for, if not play in a Notre Dame football game is diminished by such manipulation. That said, Sean Astin is wholly credible as Rudy. Other noteworthy performances are provided by Ned Beatty (Rudy's father, Daniel), Charles S. Dutton (Fortune), Robert Prosky (Father Cavenaugh), Jon Favreau (D-Bob), Lili Taylor (Sherry), and Scott Benjaminson (Frank). Both the &quot;Real Rudy&quot; and the &quot;Reel Rudy&quot; faced two significant barriers to being admitted to Notre Dame and then playing in a varsity football game: weak grades and diminutive size. Eventually, through tenacious study while enrolled at nearby Holy Cross College, both Rudys are finally admitted to Notre Dame; through rigorous training, both then became fit enough to be selected to play on the practice (i.e. fodder) squad.  And finally, both play (the &quot;Real Rudy&quot; for 27 seconds) in the last home game against Georgia Tech in 1975.<br />Others have their own reasons for liking this film so much. Here are three of mine. First, the casting of Astin in the lead role. His performance is endearing, to be sure, but also convincing. Hence my discomfort with Anspaugh's use of gimmicks when none is necessary. Second, the exteriors shot on the Notre Dame campus which is especially lovely during each of the four seasons. I really did feel as if I were tagging along with Rudy as he attends classes, works for Fortune as a member of the stadium's groundskeeping crew, and then participates in especially brutal team practices. Third and finally, I enjoyed observing what seems to be a totally authentic respect for Rudy among the team's starters both on offense and defense. That respect was earned day in and day out, brutal practice after brutal practice, as Rudy and his battered companions helped to prepare the team for its next game. It is worth noting that Rudy Ruettiger was the only player ever to be carried off the field at Notre Dame stadium. The filmmakers recreated the scene with real fans during a break in the 1992 Boston College game. Some 60,000 fans stood and cheered as actor Sean Astin was carried off the field.<br />Those who enjoyed this film should also check out The Natural (1984), Hoosiers (1986), Babe (1995), Remember the Titans (2000), and Miracle (2004).<br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br />Those who are curious about the &quot;real&quot; and &quot;reel&quot; Rudy Ruettiger are encouraged to visit [...] Here are brief excerpts:<br />Q: Was the groundskeeper played by Charles S. Dutton a real character?<br />A: Rudy answered no to this question himself during an interview with the Pigskin Post by saying the following, &quot;He was a composite, but that was reality. And that's what happened in my life...all through my life. I would encounter people like that and they would help me get through the tough times through their wisdom and their encouragement.&quot;<br />Q: Was there actually a priest who helped Rudy get into Holy Cross Junior College?<br />A: In the same Pigskin Post interview as above, Rudy replied to this question by saying, &quot;There were several who played important roles, but, again, you can't develop them all in one two-hour movie.&quot;<br />Q: Did Rudy really sleep in the maintenance room of the football stadium?<br />A: Rudy actually slept in a room in the basketball arena. The school had the room there for someone to stay during off-hours for insurance reasons.<br />Q: Was coach Dan Devine really that cold-hearted against dressing Rudy for the last home game of Rudy's college career?<br />A: In Devine's autobiography, Simply Devine, he writes that it was his idea to dress Rudy for the final game of his collegecareer and also to play him. Devine says that the screenwriter, Angelo Pizzo, told him that the plot would only work if Devine became the heavy. He agreed in order to help out Rudy, someone whom he calls a friend. &quot;I didn't realize I would be such a heavy,&quot; he writes.career and also to play him.

B00006FDCD|5.0|This is probably the best Stephen King movie I have ever watched. Sure, it may be about 3 hours long, but it's so enjoyable it seems to go like an hour. Tim Curry, plays Pennywise the clown extremely well, he can be very similar to Freddy Kreugar (scary, but funny). <br />The film is all about a couple of murders that are being commited in the small town of Maine. No one knows who is doing them, but there is one person who thinks he knows. He thinks it could be the work of &quot;It&quot;. He calls up a group of old childhood friends, and tells them &quot;It&quot; has returned. &quot;It&quot; was a clown, who lived in the sewers. He tried to have the group of kids killed when they were young, but he failed, and the kids killed him, but know he has returned. One by one, as he phones them, they all head to Maine, to stop &quot;It&quot;, who they tried to stop before when they were kids. <br />The film starts off in present day, but when each of the frieds get the phone call off the man, we see flashbacks from each of them, from when they were kids, and how &quot;It&quot; tried to kill them. It's split into two parts. The first part is showing the kids' flashbacks, the second is showing the kids in present day, ready to stop &quot;It&quot; again.<br />The film does have a fair share of shocks, and there can be some quite creepy and disturbing scenes. But this is a great horror film... but the climax is bloody awful. &quot;It&quot; turns into a massive spider! Get real! Just miss the last 20 minutes or so.
1400049628|4.0|As one of the key specialists in Solanum - the zombie disease - and its effects/causes, I can say that Max Brooks succeeds more than he fails. As one of the key members of the party interviewed by him for the compilation of this book (my name and the name of my team must remain anonymous for confidential, governmental reasons), I can say that I am delighted in the fact that Brooks has covered nearly all of the important bases. Make no mistake-this book will both save lives, and it is, at the time of this writing, the most comprehensive survival guide on the topic of Solanum currently available. In addition, the terms that Brooks creates - namely, Classes 1-4 to identify the intensification of individual outbreaks, are brilliant, simple-to-understand concepts. <br />All this said, there are a few glaring facts that Brooks left out of his manuscript, and I am at a loss to understand why. As some of his key interviewees, my team gave him important facts and data that he left out - information that could literally be a matter of life and death during outbreaks.<br />Another reader has already mentioned Brook's shrugging off of the &quot;voodoo zombie,&quot; produced by a mysterious zombie powder. He only devotes a few pages to them, dismisses them as &quot;living,&quot; and basically tells how to avoid them. They are less of a threat and more of a nuisance according to Brooks. In fact, my team has concluded (and had already informed Brooks while he was compiling his book) that the &quot;zombie powder,&quot; which is indeed different from Solanum yet equally grounded in science, certainly produces a type of zombie that is quite dead - and dangerous! The process is simple: The victim's heart and nerves stop functioning, leaving them clinically dead. The powder has a chemical reaction with the endorphins within the body and produces pure motorized energy within the corpse, creating a unique type of artificial nervous system. The brain, lacking oxygen, still functions minimally with this energy, which is enough to stop decay in the body. Because the brain still works as a simple device, the zombie - as Brooks correctly points out - does not devour flesh, flees if frightened, and obeys simple orders. Like Solanum zombies, they can only be deactivated by destroying the brain. Unlike Solanum zombies, the zombie powder provides fast, regenerative healing for any other part of their body.<br />A stronger exploration of the zombie powder is crucial for two reasons: 1) Voodoo zombies are a threat in their own right, as they mindlessly follow the orders of their witch doctor that revived them, and they also have near superhuman strength. 2) After the powder has effected them, they cannot be effected by Solanum. Therefore, they can be made as formidable allies against Solanum zombies. Why doesn't Brooks mention the documented 1967 case in Haiti, when, during a Class 1 Solanum outbreak, a witch doctor put firearms into the hands of voodoo zombies and told them to attack? The result was a resounding success - zero human casualty. Didn't Brooks find this information in the least bit important?<br />In addition, Brooks fails to mention the importance of submarines for underwater travel/survival/research regarding Solanum outbreaks. Humans are completely safe within their thick metallic walls from zombies, and subs only have to reemerge to the surface to refill air tanks on occasion, also leaving pirate and looter attacks unlikely. All five cases in which submarines were used for Solanum incidents resulted in resounding success - in fact, at the time Brooks interviewed us, he was on board our submarine, and we demonstrated its efficiency. He seemed most impressed, and scribbled notes down. Did he lose them? Did he forget? That Brooks merely left this information out of his book is mind-boggling to my team and myself. <br />His tone is also inappropriate: Saying lines like (and I paraphrase), &quot;You wish you'd have been more careful as the cold teeth of the undead dig into your flesh,&quot; might be effective writing, but it seems harsh and inappropriate for a serious, good-intentioned book. Surely Brooks could have turned the sarcastic tone down a bit.<br />All this to say, this book is certainly important, and it will be quite an act to follow. Fortunately, my team's follow-up book, due to be released later this year via a government-based website (check [...] for updates) should correct some of Brook's glaring mistakes. Before that time, however, his guide is the best on the market.
0375713751|5.0|This book is a guaranteed laugh for any mother out there -- whether she is a stay-at-home mom or a work-outside-the-home mom who then works-at-home when she gets back home!  Allison Pearson has a great knack for telling this story with humor while letting us into Kate Reddy's heart -- someplace Kate herself isn't ready to see until the end of the story.  This isn't a male-bashing book.  On the contrary, Kate loves her husband and the contributions he makes to their life and family.  What she doesn't get, though, is why the roles of men and women are what they are.  And frankly, neither do I.
B00005JLWN|1.0|I saw it on tv. For the first 30 minutes, I didn't like it. When it was over, I still didn't like it. Even with the fight scenes, I didn't like it.
B0001RVTXO|4.0|I have yet to purchase this cd because no one can tell me if the songs have been remastered. I own all the individual cds and therefore have no reason to buy it unless the sound quality is improved over the original versions. Can someone please tell me? It doesn't say on the outer packaging but will refer to remastering somewhere in the credits/liner notes if any remastering was done.<BR>Thanks very much.
B0001907DA|2.0|I was watching Police academy 6 from this box set today and all the audio is coming out of the center channel. After a quick check of my cables and other DVDS it appears they mixed this movie down to one channel.  Oh well at least *THIS* one is in widescreen.  As someone else said, I've never seen a box set with this many flaws but if you're a fan of Police academy what other choice do you have?
0790729628|5.0|Nobody likes the theatrical release, so get over it.  Ridley Scott couldn't ever get over how the studio treated this film, and 11 years later, he finally got his wish.  Every allusion to Deckard being a replicant was removed in the theatrical release, and the ridiculous voice-over narration was added to help the flow that Scott worked so hard to craft himself.  The happy ending was replaced with one of the best endings I've ever seen.  Thing is, the movie is so subtle, that most people don't ever really realize that Deckard is a replicant until someone else tells them.  Then they become obsessed with how and why they missed it.  They go back and watch it over and over looking for all the clues Ridley Scott left for them.  That's one of the things that's so brilliant about this film, it places you as the detective.<br />The clues:<BR>1-Listen closely to Deckard's debriefing near the beginning.  He was told that six replicants hijacked the cargo ship.  Four escaped and one was killed.  The fate of number six was never explained.<br />2-The photo from Leon's apartment that Deckard analyzes contains a blurred image of a man that is sitting in the same position that Deckard is at that very moment.  Possibly hinting that Deckard was an associate of Leon's.<br />3-Speaking of photos, we know that replicants collect photos to confirm their existence....Deckard had an incredible amount of antique photos scattered about his apartment.<br />4-Deckard dreams of an unicorn while slumped over his piano.  Possibly a memory....at the end of the movie, Detective Gaff leaves Deckard an origami unicorn.  How did he know of the unicorn dream?  Because he's aware of all of Deckard's implanted memories.  This also shows that not only was Gaff there as Rachel slept (he was supposed to kill her) but he reveals to Deckard that he's aware of his true nature.  And Gaff, of course, let's them both go. <br />There are still some people that reject these clues, claiming that it's the wishful thinking of movie geeks.  But Ridley Scott himself confirmed that Deckard is a replicant.  In an interview with the BBC while promoting Blade Runner- Director's Cut, Scott explained all the details behind Deckard's true nature, and explained the studio execs that removed most of the clues did so because they couldn't follow the story.  Even though it was his biggest box office failure, Ridley Scott still considers his Director's Cut edition of Blade Runner his greatest film.  I'd have to agree.
B0000029LG|5.0|Dangerous beats this album but this is way better than thriller, off the wall, and bad. <br />Okay this is by far the most artistic he has gotten. Why would people say this is the turning point in his career, and is some sort of flop. It sold over 20 million copies and was the third best selling album of the 90's! His Dangerous album was number one and Shania Twain's Come On Over was number two. Why would people call &quot;Invincible a flop&quot;. It sold over 12 million copies and that is great due to the fact it was never promoted. <br />Anyways, this album has one poor track, its not the way the other reviewers put it. <br />The only poor track is Little Susie. <br />Here is a review for each song:<br />SCREAM: This is when I liked Janet. She took her brothers side and wasn't selfish. She's selfish now and taking advantage of him. I hate her new album Damita Jo. Anyways, the song has a great beat and its make your jaws drop in shock.<br />THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US: I love this song. The videos are great!<br />Stranger in Moscow: Best song, i love it. Uplifting<br />This Time Around: Wow! MJ's mad<br />Earth Song: a Number one hit that is very touching<br />D.S: Second best track...Tom Sneddon IS A COLD MAN! He has a vandetta and he should be locked up and killed<br />Money: Awesome, he does some sort of rap.<br />Come Together: This lets you know that the beatles catalogue are in the right hands of a genius like michael<br />You are not alone: a number one hit that makes you cry! never gets boring<br />Childhood: an incredibly autobiographical song! a must listen<br />Tabloid Junkie: better than Jam and leave me alone<br />2 bad- love it<br />history- great, the remix on the 10 million selling BLOOD ON THE DANCEFLOOR is better though<br />Little Susie: like i said, the worst track<br />smile-one of his best works ever!@<br />visit my site: [...]
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Vol.3: The Subliminal Verses is not like the old Slipknot c.d.s. They dont say 1 swear word. They are less heavy, and they sound like Stone Sour - the cuss words. Its a good c.d. though. The only song that is really bad is circle because it is too light. The best songs are blister, pulse, duality, vermillion 1, and vermillion 2. Reccomended but if you want real good hardcore Slipknot gat Iowa.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I agree, this is his best and most artistic album to date. As he evolutionized through music, he sampled with hard rock for some tracks. Amazing.

630463949X|5.0|This is the performance that introduced this legendary rock band to a new generation in the late 1990's. This is Fleetwood Mac's first performance together in over 10 years, since Lindsey left the band in 1987, filmed live on a LA soundstage before many of Hollywood's elite. The entire band rocks out on every single song - there is not one bad performance on this DVD. The sound of the band and the quality of the DVD sound is EXCELLENT. Above all, the interaction between band members, particularly Lindsey &amp; Stevie, is PRICELESS. As Stevie Nicks said of this performance &quot;As magic as it gets, it was.&quot; Stevie Nicks proves her standing as The Queen of Rock on every song, turning on all of her trademark moves, not to mention looking and sounding incredibly beautiful. Christine McVie, equally as graceful and beautiful, treats the audience to a few of her Fleetwood Mac hits, and Lindsey proves that Fleetwood Mac just isn't the same without him. The audience is treated to a few surprises, including an emotional &quot;Landslide&quot; (the version you hear on the radio was taken from this performance) which shows clear reconsiliation between Lindsey &amp; Stevie, a visit from the USC marching band on &quot;Tusk&quot; (they also played on the &quot;Tusk&quot; album)and an AWESOME performance between Lindsey &amp; Stevie of her Grammy nominated &quot;Silver Springs&quot;. The album version of this performance was nominated for a Grammy &amp; went to #1 on the charts - you'll wonder why it didn't win an Oscar for best real-life drama after you see this one! The only set back is that &quot;Stand Back&quot; and &quot;Little Lies&quot; are not included on this performance, yet you couldn't ask for more after you finish watching it! This DVD proves why Fleetwood Mac is one of rock's most legendary bands! You'll watch it over and over again!
B00020HEG6|5.0|I've always been a fan of John Williams, since he also did the music for 'Hook.' The music for the Harry Potter movies has been wonderful, but I've been skeptical about how Prisoner of Azkaban would turn out. I shouldn't have been skeptical! Even though Williams tries different types of music with this one, like a vocal track (&quot;Double Trouble&quot;) and different types of instraments than he normally uses (&quot;A Window to the Past&quot;) this album continues the legacy of the Harry Potter films. A must buy!
B000002U8G|5.0|This is one of Pink's more unknown albums, which is unfortunate since it's one of their best. This is a great album. I would recommend it for anyone who likes stuff like The Beatles and Yes. It's different and original, just like every other Pink album out there. <BR>There is much less electric guitar and synthesizer in there, which is what makes it good. Not that the albums with that in it aren't good either.<BR>The lyrics are excellent and reflect Water's growth in writing throughout his career. The lyrics in this start to look like those of Dark Side of the Moon, one of the greatest music epics ever, and you can see by listening to them both how Meddle is the missing link to Dark Side. <BR>The vocals are great, especially Rick Wright's performance in &quot;Echoes&quot; adding a great end to a great album. <BR>Overall, if you like Pink Floyd to the point where you could never hate them no matter what they do, then buy The Wall. But Meddle is for all music fans, especially those who are Pink.
0061015725|1.0|I agree with Robert Graves' review; this book is unusually out of character for Michael Crichton in many aspects.  I was particularly astounded by the level of scientific balderdash in this book.  It was incredibly painful to read what Crichton passes off as &quot;science&quot;.  <br />In one case he talks about the nanobots eating out the carbon substrate from memory chips but not processor chips.  Excuse me! What makes processor chips so different from memory chips, that nanobots only attacked memory chips? And if that wasn't bad enough, memory chips happen to be made of SILICON! Where in the hell do you get carbon from a silicon wafer?  <br />Then there's the case where he explains how the swarm will be tagged with radioactive selenium in a glucose mixture.  I'm sorry, this is a basic technology in radioactive tagging that was completely befuddled.  Crichton has a degree from Harvard Medical school.  There is no excuse for getting these principles wrong.<br />Yes, this is certainly fiction, but boy, the science in this book is not based on any Earth science I know; it's all in Crichton's own universe.
B000002UA0|3.0|I had really expected more from this album. The lyrics and style are a little too goofy and exaggerated for my taste. If you are a fan of Pink's 70's era music, then you'll find this album shockingly different from normal Pink Floyd. <BR>The sounds and guitar (especially in the song &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;) I find grate on your nerves after a while, and, I find, are very annoying. <BR>The vocals are alright, which is why i gave this three (not one) stars. If you like The Beatles then you might like the vocals in this album, but Im not sure i can compare the sounds and feel with anything else, except disappointment. For all the praise this album gets, I find it overrated.
B000003N7Y|4.0|Most of the works on this album are alternate versions of songs that he had recorded elsewhere. Due to the various label requirements, and the various whims of the artist, most of them are renamed.<br />  Haitian Fight Song =&gt; II B.S.<br />  Better Get It In Your Soul =&gt; Better Get Hit In Your Soul<br />  Goodbye Pork Pie Hat =&gt; Theme For Lester Young<br />  E's Flat Ah's Flat Too =&gt; Hora Decubus<br />What makes these versions unique, and worth having on their own, is the 9 piece band. Mingus was experimenting with the form and structure of the group, and was using some of his existing material to see what he could do with a larger group. The results are dramatic -- faster pacing, higher highs, lower lows.<br />Nothing here is as great an achievement as &quot;The Black Saint And The Sinner Lady&quot; or &quot;Mingus Ah Um&quot;, but the new arrangements are quite fun and perfectly enjoyable.
6305922756|5.0|Its ONE star louder.<br />Classic movie and the humor is timeless.<br />Its funny that there are so many people today that don't realize that &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; began as a total parody.
B000174LVQ|5.0|I had the great privilege of seeing Paco perform at UCLA a few months back, and it was definitely one of the greatest experiences of my life.  Paco de Lucia is, indisputably, a visionary of flamenco, the guitar and music.<br />Cositas Buenas is a very good album.  There are a few tracks that feel a little too &quot;smooth&quot; to me, but overall, they are what I've come to expect out of Paco--perfection.  As he's gotten older, his music has gained maturity, so he's not as concerned with nonstop 128th notes as much as the overall structure of the music, and he has been going in this direction for the last decade or so.<br />It's a very melodic album, to be sure, and I think he utilizes vocals and compas-clapping more than in his previous albums.  Listening to Paco play his guitar, it is so evident that he has long since gained a complete control over the technical aspects of it, and subsequently, can bend the will of his instrument in whatever way he sees fit to advance the music.  Always a visionary, Paco's superhuman musical abilities allow him to create music that is simply impossible for most people to play (a nice aspiration for those of us who play flamenco to dream of).  This kind of skillful and subtle technique is especially evident in such tracks as Antonia (a buleria por solea) and El Tesorillo (tientos) very beautiful, deep tracks that embody the essence of Paco's contribution to flamenco.  I also really like Casa Bernardo (rumba), which showcases Paco's tightly-knit band working together in harmony very well.  Dig that sax!  It's inspiring to know that not only is the man himself amazing, but so is the rest of his group, and I can tell you, from seeing them live, that they have an almost telepathic-like connection, full of energy and spirit.<br />I don't think it is quite as good or solemn as his previous album, Luzia, which was dedicated to his mother, but that's pretty hard to top.
B00005JLKN|2.0|Red Dragon, the film, is more an annoying example of Hollywood's mewling efforts to create continuity by simply milking a concept for all it's worth, than a quality adaptation of good material. For a near perfect example of the latter hunt down a copy of Michael Mann's 1986 film \\"Manhunter\\". I know a lot of people have written similar comments but I have something to add. Red Dragon is a lot like the LA Lakers, an assembly of mercenary talent that when cobbled together fails to claim it's own life as more than the sum of it's parts. Each member of the cast fulfills their obligations, the problem is that no one really seems to go the distance. These are all actors playing roles possibly made self conscious by the existence of an already excellent forbearer. Watch MANHUNTER, Cox is better than Hopkins because he makes Lecktor real. He does not play the character as a superhuman fancypants gas-bag, but as a harmless middle-aged man, the kind you might bump into on the street or have taken a class or two from. Will Petersen of CSI fame is a better Graham simply because he projects a vulnerability that Norton can't touch. Petersen's Graham like Harris' is a man treading on thin ice. He seems almost more absorbed by his own struggle than in the case. One final thing is the music, Danny Elfman's score in this film is to music what necrophillia is to sex. In Manhunter the music does almost as much work getting you inside the heads of the characters as the actors do. The music does in Manhunter what like an hour's worth of Ralph Feinnes running around naked in some comically awkward scenes do poorly in Red Dragon.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Another year at Hogwarts, another round of trials, mis-steps, and tribulations for Harry at the hands of his various tormenters. This movie builds on the first to provide more insight into the school, its inhabitants, and the world of magic -- and dark intrigue -- that follows Harry into his unexpected world. But at the edges of what is still a fairly fluffy* movie, a real darkness is beginning to appear, a portent of the impending evil that destined to entangle Harry and his companions sooner than later.<br />The movie does take liberties with the book, but unless one is willing to sit through a 5-hour marathon, the trimming was required; the core and intent remain intact.<br />The Potter movies have become a replacement for the &quot;continued next week&quot; serial installments popular with kids in local theaters (not so) long ago.<br />Certainly there is same anticipation, even if you've read the books: will the hero win this round? How can we wait for the next installment?!<br />(*Cognoscenti may say &quot;Fluffy&quot; was not the best choice of descriptions.)
B00005JN2F|1.0|I snagged a Sneak Peek movie pass from a coworker yesterday to check out this film.  Universal would not allow the name to get out.  It was a huge secret.  We were not sure if we would be seeing \\"Two Brothers\\", \\"Spider-Man 2\\" or something else.  I finally learned my fate when a rep. announced it as the lights dimmed.  Gosh, how I wish I got out then.  <br />Long story short, I have not seen the first film.  Hence, I really had no idea what was going on.  It's one of those movies that keeps moving from country to country like an online Lonely Planet guide.  The name of the place shoots up on the screen so that we can read it.  They do this because you can't tell from the script where you are.  It's all convoluted and dry.  Damon has never done worse work.  He looks like a robot from the new Will Smith movie than he does a real man most of the time.  There is an emotional part near the beginning that was nice, but then it is all procedural FBI/police type stuff.  <br />If you have a calendar of Matt staring down at you right now, you should go and see this.  If you will be starring in a new episode of a one-season cop show, go.  <br />If you are hoping for a coherent, fun summer flick, look elsewhere.
B00003CWNR|3.0|The book the Cider House rules is one of my favorite books. The movie didn't quite do it justice. Many of the sub plots are missing and the whole general plot is condensed into just one generation. Because of this many of the important themes are lost and Homer's ultimate decision doesn't seem as important or meaningful. Also, it only seems to skim over the love between Dr. larch and Homer; it is much more profound in written words. It would be a good movie if you have never read the book because then you don't realize what you are missing, but I would recommend reading the book instead of watching the movie.
0743216458|5.0|While the concept of teamwork draws acclaim in corporate circles, real life examples of what teamwork can accomplish for an organization are all too rare.  This book takes care of that need, by portraying the total dedication of a group of soliders who grew up together, fought together, cried together, grieved together, and became triumphant together. Fortunately, the book brings the same &quot;you are there&quot; sensation provided by the video series, which I saw before reading the book.<br />If you want to teach your group about teamwork, start with this book.  They will learn what it means to be totally dedicated to a mission, and to give of yourself far more sacrificially than anyone could expect.<br />This book portrays one of the most heroic periods in American history.  You will enjoy it, and will cherish even more the freedoms the Band of Brothers protected for us.
B00005JMUA|3.0|Kill Bill Volume 2 wasn't a great movie but it was a good movie. Not as exciting and fun to watch as volume one. Although I enjoyed most parts of volume 2, it lack the action and fun to watch mentality that volume one had atleast until the fight scenes happen which there wasn't too much off in Volume 2. This movie spent entirely too much time talking and not enough action. I still plan to buy the DVD sequel when it is released, I still like Kill Bill Vol.2, but I love Vol. 1 and for these reasons I gave Kill Bill Vol.2 three stars because I like the movie but I do not love it.
0553278223|5.0|The Martian Chronicles is an important book, especially now. It is a whatif, a maybe and a possibility. We are just now coming to grips with the reality that Mars will someday be inhabited by humans, but what of the Martians? Who were they? What did they call themselves? What would they think and how would they feel about us taking over their planet? This book left a lot to ponder. I read it in elemetary school, and recently picked it up again and it's still spellbinding and even a bit scarey. This could be our future, our present...or maybe even our past. I recommend this book for any and all scifi fans, Bradbury fans, and people who just want to read something that stirs the heart as much as the mind.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is one of the most ambitious animated films ever made. It's a gorgeous, elegant, and absolutely amazing landmark in animation; a film so charming, memorable, and beautiful that it has been hailed as the most incomparable film in the animated genre, and with good reason. Detailed backgrounds, glorious colors, outstanding visuals and beautiful music are all contributing factors to the grandeur pageantry that &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; enthralls on its audience.<br />Up until the last few years, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; was actually considered one of the few Disney 'failures.' That means, a poor box-office success. But that was 1959. Since then, the film, like &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia,&quot; has returned to theaters many times and made way on video for new generations to enjoy, earning large estimates of money and critical praise, not to mention being the most requested Disney film on video after &quot;Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;The Lion King.&quot; <br />It was finally re-released in a fantastic Special Edition DVD, and looking back, I can't believe this was once considered a failure. As if! This is not just a timeless tale of good and evil; the plot is elegantly portrayed with rich textures and stunning animation.<br />Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's best animated films, EVER, and a must-own DVD for any collection. If only Disney still made films like this. I don't think we could be so lucky. Don't delay, get this before time runs out!!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|I think that it is riduclous that this will only be released in the special edition form and i think that we should boycott until he decides that he will release it in its original form.  no doubt that he will re-release a 6 disk set when episode 3 comes out.  maybe then we will see the original.  Lucas has turned into an ego maniac and a control freak and i personnally will not be buying this drivel.  thank you.
B000000OA6|5.0|I was glad to see all of the good reviews for this album, it deserves it! Freddy sings with such joy for life even though he knew he was dying. Maybe that's why he could see the beauty of this world that many of us take for granted. But then again the man always seemed to enjoy life to the fullest. This album is solid from start to finish. Brian May's guitar playing is as tasty as ever. Freddy has got to be one of the greatest vocalists ever (next to RJD, Rob Halford, Chris Cornell, and Paul Stanley). His melodies and phrasing are superb. Almost all of Queen's albums should be in your collection but this one has a special place in my heart. The Show Must Go On!
B00003CXC6|5.0|When Akira Kurasawa released this film in 1950, it was not expected to do well.  When it won various awards around the world, including the Academy award for best foreign film, the reaction was one of some surprise.  Now, over 50 years later, Rashomon stands as a benchmark in cinema, a film that has been copied and ripped off countless times, but never duplicated.  The camera work, storytelling, script, and setting are flawless, giving us the proper mood right from the start.<br />The start is a torrential rainstorm, where several men sit around discussing a trial they have either witnessed, or taken part in.  The trial concerns the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife, apparantly at the hands of a famous bandit (played by Toshiro Mifune, a Kurasawa favorite).  The story of what actually happened is told through the point of view of the bandit, the woman, the dead man (through a spriritual medium) and a woodcutter who was there and now is standing with these men at the beginning of the film.<br />The interesting thing is that we as the audience are left to assume what really happened, as the film gives no definitive solution.  The subject is really the nature of man, and how point of view will change the perception of a scenario to favor or in some cases, cast a negative light on events that transpire.<br />This was the first film to shoot directly at the sun.  In fact, the beginning shot of the woodcutter traveling into the woods to cut lumber is breathtaking, the camera weaves in and out, up and down, through branches and leaves, showing just how far out of the way these things will be happening.  The excellent DVD has a feature on the camera work, which you will find interesting and will help you when you go back to the film for a second viewing.<br />Also included with the disc is a booklet with the two short stories Kurasawa used as the premise for the film (most notably &quot;In the Grove&quot;)along with an excerpt from Kurasawa's book about the shooting of the film and the apprehension of the Japanese film companies about the fact that the story seemed to have no good ending.  Kurasawa explained that the story was not about the solution of the murder as it was about the nature of man.<br />Film fans need to see this movie.  So many movies made in the last few years (Snake Eyes, The Usual Suspects) owe themselves to Rashomon, movies which show us points of view that are not necessarily the truth.  The fact is that four people can see a situation but report it four completely different ways.  What's the truth?  The truth is--that's just human nature.
B000001EUN|5.0|Got this album on cassette in the mail from RCA in the early 80's and soon realized what a fine slab of metal I had bought. The production is very raw and the guitar riffs are the best of any Scorpions album. Make It Real, Falling In Love, The Zoo, and Only A Man rock hard. The title track is slow and hypnotizing. The sole ballad Lady Starlight contains some great Micheal Schenker style playing (hmmmmm?). Taken By Force, Blackout, Virgin Killer, and Love Drive should also be part of your collection!
B0000039PW|5.0|I bought this album around 5 months ago, and I'm glad I did. I was a fan of Biggie's already, but this just instilled my belief that Biggie Smalls is a rap legend. I always keep this CD close to my CD player. My favorite tracks are 'Gimme the Loot', 'Juicy', 'Everyday Struggle', and 'Big Poppa', but the others are worth listening to. If you like rap, then I strongly recommend this album.
B000002GB9|5.0|This album is without a doubt one of the best albums ever made. The songwriting is excellent and there is not one weak song on it. My favorites are Man In The Wilderness, Miss America, and Castle Walls. Despite the fact that Styx became more \\"poppy\\" in the early 80s this album contains some rocking guitar. Keyboards are used tastefully and the lyrics are very intelligent. Pieces Of Eight is another Styx classic. Get them both!!
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I am thinkin' about buyin' this album 'cause it is the Bomb
B000001EL3|5.0|Bob Ezrin cracked the whip and was able to get the best out of these guys. The production is great and the songs are for the most part very strong. I never get tired of hearing Detroit Rock City, Shout It Out Loud, Do You Love Me, and Great Expectations. I could do without Sweet Pain but it's not a bad song. They could have included one song with Ace on vocals but apparently he was too busy most of the time playing poker while they were recording this album. The overall sound is a bit dark with a lot of reverb but I like it that way. Great album cover too! Man, the 70s was easily the best decade for rock music.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to see that at least someone had the courage to stick to the original story and not make a kiddie-friendly, politically-correct fairy-tale out of it.  The music is very dark, romantic, European, old-world, without a touch of giddy Broadway.  The rendition of the characters is very faithful.  Sure, I would like to see Esme a bit younger and more innocent, but Quasi is cast perfectly.  I believe, Garou is the youngest actor ever cast in that role.  I am not a huge fan of the movie versions with Lon Chaney and Charles Laughton, because both actors are in their forties.  Garou is convincing as a bitter 20-year old with raging hormones.  His voice is filled with anger and tenderness at once, a combination that liquifies your heart.  Same goes for Daniel Lavoie, who plays Frollo.  Lavoie is tall, slender, silver-haired.  It's hard to believe that the heroine pays no attention to either one of those men.  What can I say?  I love the music, I love the cast.  If you want to discuss this further, feel free to e-mail me at M_J_Neary@hotmail.com.
B000005RQE|5.0|Following on from the difficult though rewarding [[ASIN:B0000073AX Fables Of The Reconstruction]] and [[ASIN:B000005RQF Life's Rich Pageant]], R.E.M.'s final independent release, \\"Document\\", stands as the best thing they ever did.<br /><br />Though R.E.M. have been criticised by some as the offspring of early 1980s pop music, this criticism could never be levelled at what they do on \\"Document\\". More than anything else, the music on \\"Document\\" is proof of the eccentricity R.E.M. were developing during their years at now-defunct independent label IRS.<br /><br />Often seen as R.E.M.'s effort at \\"power pop\\", \\"Document\\" really was and is much, much more than that. The amazingly thing about this album is that the band manages to be incredibly funny on the standout \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" and at the same time develop their musicianship into waters they were never to chart after moving to Warners. The dark \\"Fireplace\\" and \\"Lighning Hopkins\\" were equally brilliant: ominous, yet amazingly powerful for that.<br /><br />The more familiar, famously sly \\"The One I Love\\" might not quite compare with these three tracks, but still it marks out the direction of their best-selling [[ASIN:B000002MG1 Automatic For The People]] album five years before the fact. \\"Finest Worksong\\", especially in its remixed version found as a bonus track, was a superb tribute to the past folk heroes in America. One can also see just how ironic Stipe wanted to be - and WAS - on \\"It's The End Of The World As We Know It\\" - in which he describes so well the realities facing us today.<br /><br />A record that, though acclaimed in its time, is now often forgotten. Nonetheless, if you can only buy one R.E.M. record, it should be this one.
B00018D44U|2.0|Norah vs. Dena. They both sing, play piano, compose, arrange so what is the difference? Norah is BORING. and Dena is EXCITING. I stacked my CD player on one side with Norah's's latest Cd's and the other side with DENA'S AND HAD MY OWN JAZZ IDOL COMPETITION. AND THE WINNER IS DENA DEROSE HANDS DOWN. Compare song samples here, and you decide if I was right. I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU WON'T BE BORED  WITH DENA. I have played Dena's albums 3 hrs. straight and was never bored. Can you say that about Norah's?
B0000640VO|4.0|My friend insisted I watch Amelie though I was a little hesitant. I assumed it to be one among the plethora of must see foreign movies that have come into the spotlight in more recent times. However, I was proved wrong.<BR>Amelie is a simple story told in a unique and stylish way. I am inclined to think that at least a part of its charm is to do with the fact that it is in French but this is just one little thing. I like the attention to detail in the film, the way the narrator introduces characters telling the audience his or her likes and dislikes. <BR>Tautou does a very good job, she is very comfortable in her character and is very well cast.
B00018D44U|2.0|I was a devoted fan of Norah's. I have all her albums. But recently, I have become very disappointed with her current albums. I'am a jazz devotee. When I counted all the reviewers who share my disappontment with this latest album, I decided to look for an up and coming jazz vocalist who sings, plays, composes jazz. I was lucky to find such a singer at the jazz festivals I attended. Let me introduce you to Dena Derose, who I think is everything that Norah  is not. &quot;Love's Holiday&quot; is an extremely satisfying, refreshing CD. Her signature sound is vocalizing her piano solos or scatting with her swinging piano solos. Her voice is crystalline in sound, with impeccable jazz phrasing where she can easily change keys or slide through the bars with horn-like pacing. She has an outstanding backup group that she has organized. DeRose has arrived. I guarantee there won't be one disappointed jazz fan of Dena Derose. Win me back Diana..
B0000A98ZP|5.0|The quintessential John Hughes film.  I remember in my English class my junior year (1987) we had to analyze this movie.  Only 2 years after it's release it was had all the qualities needed for a class analysis.  I will spare you the report that I did back then.<br />Since then I have watched this movie at least once a year (and contrary to popular believe it is not for the panty shot).  The characters are very well done.  There is something that anyone who went through high school can relate to, even if we fit more than just one character.  The interactions between the teens towards each other and then towards the principal as a group is classic.  It's got love, teen angst, popular kids, geeks, dweebs, outcasts and the ever popular kid that doesn't fit in but always tries to get the attention.  Nothing like dumping out your bag for people to go through to get attention.  <br />Of course you can't forget the star cast of strong 80's actors, Emilio Estevez  (Andrew 'Andy') Anthony Michael Hall (Brian) Judd Nelson (John Bender) Molly Ringwald (Claire) Ally Sheedy (Allison) and Paul Gleason (Principal).  Great acting, John's look at teenagers and a great script all make for a very enjoyable look at the interactions and `attitude' typical of the high school years.<br />I truly could go on about this movie but I won't.  I'll just say that this is a much have for any movie buff and if you haven't seen it you must.
B000002JSR|4.0|This album is what it is. A collection of outtakes, but it's still Led Zeppelin. If Coda had been released 20 years after the band split, instead of when it was, it would have received far more fanfare, and better reviews than it did. I'd recommend this to anyone. <br />It's similiar to The Beatles' &quot;Let It Be&quot;, in that it's by far not their best work, but so vastly superior to most other bands that it's still pretty good.
B0001611DI|3.0|I have to agree with Stu (below) on this one.  I'm a huge horror movie fan, even a zombie movie fan (I really liked 21 Days Later), but I honestly don't see why this movie is considered by so many to be one of the greatest of the genre.<br />1) The special effects are not so special--in some cases you can actually see where the blue zombie makeup ends at the actors' necks!<BR>2) The acting is bad--really, porno movie bad, particularly in the first half of the film (though I admit it does get better in the second half).<BR>3) I get the social commentary (the zombies can't stay away from the shopping mall), but it only goes so far.<br />All that being said, I don't think this movie is horrible.  There are some decidedly scary scenes, and I think the story develops at a reasonable (albeit leisurely) pace.  I just don't think it deserves \\"classic\\" status.<br />I know this is not the popular viewpoint, but there it is.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Buy this album.  Now.  You won't be disappointed.<br />If you're a Nightwish fan, you've probably noticed that the band has improved with each release.  \\"Once\\" tops them all.  It is the heaviest, most melodic album this supremely talented band has ever done, and that's saying a lot after the excellence of \\"Century Child.\\"  Every track is good.  Not many albums can captivate from start to finish, but this one does.<br />I repeat: buy this CD.  Immediately.  Trust me.
B0002234LS|5.0|It's true that I am both a Stephen King and a Johnny Depp fan and that may have biased my opinion of this movie a bit, but I honestly think I would've liked the movie anyway because the plot was fantastic and the acting superb.  I read the story years ago and pretty much knew what was going to happen, but it was great seeing Johnny as Mort and there was still the sweet element of &quot;wow&quot; near the end there when the secrets of the movie are revealed.<br />Some movies I walk away thinking, &quot;I want the last two hours of my life back!&quot;.  But this one was entertaining throughout and I consider it time well spent.  My 11 and 13 year old children liked it too, and their attention spans are not held by boring, slow paced movies.
B00006JQU1|5.0|Podger's reading of the Six is technically dazzling and wonderfully recorded. Her style and choice of instrument (a Baroque violin) capture the dance origins of many of the movements from each sonata and partita, especially the D minor Giga. She plays with an incredible lightness that makes these works sound as though they are effortless. She freely adds mordents, trills, and other minor articulations not written into the original manuscript (of which I have a copy), though these additions do nothing to detract from the overall performance.<BR>Her tempi are swift (sometimes exceedingly so), and the Ciaconna in particular moves with an almost breathless pace (though not TOO fast, as in Van Daeyl's version for Naxos). Overall, though I thoroughly enjoyed these performances, the budget recordings (available at your local music store) by Christiane Edinger on Amadis (a Naxos label) are my favorites. For most, though, Podger will suffice. Edinger plays in a hard, almost violent manner, as though her life depends on this music (especially in the Ciaconna), while Podger's playing is sheer exuberance and love for the music. Both renderings capture the spirit and sheer virtuosity of Bach's most impressive creation. This set is a bargain by far, though, and is highly recommended!
B00006F7S4|5.0|This cd is truly a classic. What a bit of inspired music. And what a change for Beck from his previous 2 or 3 cds. Might take 2 or 3 listens to appreciate it but if you have gone through some serious life experiences you are bound to appreciate this stunning and sublime album.
B00004SZWB|4.0|After Stevie released the confused experimental record, \\"Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants\\", he returned to his R&B roots and released \\"Hotter Than July\\". This is the true follow-up to his 1976 double-album masterpiece, \\"Songs In The Key Of Life\\". \\"Hotter Than July\\" is a very straightforward pop record because of its 80's production and sound. It's a more glossy production. The opening, \\"Did I Hear You Say You Love Me\\", is an upbeat dance number with energetic synthesizer and guitar hooks. \\"All I Do\\" is one of the best songs on this album. It's a funk/disco-type track with a oh-so-fly beat. \\"Rocket Love\\" is probably my favorite song on this disc. It's a sexy ballad with Stevie talking about a woman any man would be incensed by, who would depart too soon with his love. The song, itself, has a variety of synthesizers and drum machines being played throughout the song. It's just a classic. Next, there's \\"I Aint Gonna Stand For It\\", which is a country/pop-type tune with laid-back slide guitar hooks. \\"As If You Read My Mind\\" is one of my personal favorites on here. The song has a tropical vibe in it. The drum beats have a reggae feel in them. \\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\" is a reggae tune in the sprit of and in tribute to Bob Marley. \\"Do Like You\\" is a funky ode to Stevie's son, who dreams of being a dancer. \\"Cash In Your Face\\" is the only downside on this album. The rhythms are not-so even, but the song is worth a listen. It has a message of housing and job discrimination. It really takes me back to the Innervisions period, where he was at his political peak. \\"Lately\\" is just a classic. It's a lovely ballad that has him playing a piano and bass synthesizer, I think. It's probably the best composition Stevie has done. \\"Happy Birthday\\" is a celebration of the heart of the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Martin Luther King. The song makes you celebrate life. It was really a vocal plea for making Dr. King's birthday recognized as a national holiday. It's an exciting song. Overall, \\"Hotter Than July\\" is a consistent and great album. I consider this as his best album from the 80's-era. The synthesizers are a little dated, but the rhythms are top notch. They vary so much that it is a wonder that they are all inside the mind of one man and that they can all be delivered from a genius. All I can say is that it's a great follow-up to Songs In The Key Of Life. \\"Hotter Than July\\" is quite a sheer of artistic brilliance. This is truly a disc that you will play over and over again.

0141439661|5.0|Although SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not of one Jane Austen's best novels, it is nonetheless a major novel, with the author's then-young talent in full display.  Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.<br />The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor.  When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice.  Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby.  As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love.  In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.<br />SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone.  Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about.  Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed.  Reserved Elinor and exuberant Marianne are expertly drawn, with Edward, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon (whose lovesick hopes for Marianne are dashed again and again) also engaging creations.  Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.<br />This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations.  Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters.  It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.<br />Just because this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book.  I highly recommend this novel for all readers.s almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed.

1920769005|5.0|\\"Shantaram\\" is a book that will stay with you long after your eyes pass over the last words on the last page.  In all my years reading, I have never come across a book that has touched me so deeply, and shook the very core of my beliefs.  Roberts recalls his adventures, to put it lightly, with such descriptive power that you feel you are there beside him the entire way.  It is hard not to fall in love with his Bombay and the characters found within. It is the most honest, heartfelt and gut wrenching book I have ever read, and I fear, will ever read.  For a book of this length it is a marvel that Roberts has paced it so well, moving gracefully from scenes of horrific prison torture and neglect to personal reflections on his failures and on the undeniable powers of fate and love.<BR>There is so much more I could say about this book, but I find it best summed up in the authors own words:<BR>\\"May the journey, through these pages, as in life, always bring you to peace, joy and love.\\" - Greg Roberts September 2003.
B00009NDAF|5.0|Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround by Louis V. Gerstner Jr. is insightful, entertaining, and full of valuable historical perspectives into the computer revolution. There are also many management approaches throughout the book that may seem like common sense to some of us, but clearly need to be re-evaluated by many mid and top-level executives. I thoroughly enjoyed the writing style and light-hearted details of the first part of the book; and found the second part of the book that detailed the major steps taken in restructuring to be equally compelling.<br />I definetly recommend this to anyone in the computer industry, anyone at an executive level of any company, and to those who just enjoy reading!
B0002234LS|5.0|I saw this movie in theater and liked it a lot, so it's no surprise that I went out and bought it today. It may not say Special Edition on the cover, but this Dvd has as many extras as most Deluxe Edtions. The Featurettes are interesting and informative and run over an hour combined. My favorite being the Secrets Revealed segment that really helps put certain things in place and make sense after viewing the film for the first time. Now to Mr. Johnny Depp! Depp has been one of my favorite actors long before Jack Sparrow came out into public view, and the performance as Mort in this little film ranks #2 of all his roles in my opinion (Right behind &quot;Pirates of the Carribean&quot; of couse). The supporting cast, direction, and music are very strong as well. It's just nice to see a thriller that takes its time to build up to the twisted conclusion, without the mindless gore (which at times is good) and the paper thin characters. The casual and huge Johnny Depp fans who enjoy a good psychological thriller should buy this one, everyone else should at least rent it to see what an amazing actor they have been missing.
B00004XPPB|5.0|Donnie Brasco is based on a true story but it is still gripping. Donnie Brasco is the alias of Joe Pistone, an undercover agent. He joins the mob as a help of Lefty played by Al Pacino. Pacino again plays a great mobster. This time as just a spoke, and sometimes not very smart.<br />But DB gets so involved that he does not know on which side he is, that is what loyalty does to him. Even his marriage is almost falling apart.<br />Depp and Pacino are of course brilliant as ever and this is another great maffia movie like Goodfellas are the Godfather.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|What is the name of the song at the end of credits before the song Urami Bushi? It has a mix of western and the flute of the orient,I like the mix. Can someone give me the title of the song or the Artist? I would be very greatful.
B000025XKM|5.0|Its average -- heh, virtually unanimous -- rating of five here probably has something to do with this:  Nick Drake died, not certainly but quite likely a suicide, about two years after its release, and in retrospect this sounds like his suicide note, whether it was or not.  It also has something to do with a car commercial that came out about 26 years too late to help Nick.<br />And none of us should be ashamed of this.  <br />The facts of an artist's life are an inextricable part of his work.  We've known this, cherished it in fact, since the first artist put a voice into music, or drew pictures and made gestures that expressed thoughts without words.  Nick Drake was one depressed dude at the end.  Either he killed himself deliberately or the drugs that did it -- and they were antidepressants -- were powerful enough to do it by accident.  <br />I got \\"Pink Moon\\" about five days ago and have played it about 35 times.  The title track and the final one (\\"From the Morning\\") move me about as much as anything I've heard.  Everything in between establishes a mood that could be interpreted as heavily flavored by sadness, if not dominated by depression.  Even \\"Morning,\\" a song of hope and uplift if ever was, is tinted by the small, haunting ache that attends the knowledge of death as an inevitable part of life.  And the death that's on our minds is, unavoidably, Nick Drake's.  It matters not why and how he died; it was too soon, this was his last record before it happened, and it colors -- unavoidably and rightly -- what we hear.  When one knows how an artist's pain worked itself out in the artist's own life, it has an inevitable impact on how one receives the record.<br />I join the people who thank Volkswagen for this record.  I never saw the VW ad; I don't watch TV enough to do that.  But I sure read enough about it here; and I only recently found that the wonderful lavish sounds I'd been hearing as sign-on music back in the early-mid '70s on good ol' WMAL-FM were Nick's own \\"Bryter Later.\\"   So I can claim to be one of the fogies who Knew Him (sorta) When.  But only the one piece.  That and the VW ad -- what's all this about a damn ad? -- prompted one of my best album purchases ever.  I'm torn -- just run back to the store where they have his other two studio releases, nine-ninety-nine the pop?  Or spring for \\"Fruit Tree\\"?<br />Drake's first two albums are lusher, more lavish, more produced, more, well, what?  optimistic.  Then this one.  Nick, his guitar, and a smattering of overdubbed but perfect piano.  It would be interesting to have heard \\"Pink Moon\\" AFTER his first two records, instead of hearing it first.  The contrast between those discs and this one is startling enough as it is.  If you want to hear folk guitar played about as well as it can be, accompanied by a voice that, light and almost airy as it is, seems to triple the weight of the lyrics, Do not pass Go.  Head straight to this record.   If you don?t have ?Pink Moon? yet, and kind of wish there wasn?t quite so much production on those two lovely Drake discs you do have, pick this one up.  ?Cause the production is, well, not.  I think it?s wonderful that we got to hear not only as much of Nick Drake as we did, but as many different sides.  I wouldn?t want the first two records without the overdubbed strings and keyboards.  This one, likewise, is perfect, just as is.   Stark, painful, full of despair and full also of hope and appreciation for the beauty the artist saw in the world.  It?s just as in the first two records, but expressed differently and just as spot-on beautifully.<br />Don?t feel bad that you first heard about Nick Drake from a car salesman.  Carlos Santana was right:  It?s getting it, not how, that counts.  You have the music now, is what matters.  The world is beautiful and it's OK.  Play \\"Pink Moon\\" again, and again.  That's Nick, telling you so.
0805053883|5.0|A few weeks ago, my 13 month old son came home from daycare with this note on his daily sheet \\"Today we read Polar Bear, Polar, What Do You Hear over and over again.  Everytime I tried to read him another book, he would push it away and point to Polar Bear\\".  Every day since this, his daily sheet has ended with \\"...and we read Polar Bear\\"  My son has favorite books at home and since he enjoys this one so much, I wanted to add it to our collection.  I also ordered the Brown Bear and Panda Bear books, hoping he will like them just as much.
B00006RINF|3.0|Don't let this review stop you from checking it out. I do like this band I think they are very good. They are good at metal but they are not the best. I won't list the bands that are. Because really that is not what this review is about. <br />This is a first good step for people who want to get into metal. Check it out and keep in open mind. This band will open you up to many other great metal bands. Because this band is a good metal band.
6304698798|4.0|4.5 stars.  In so many words, this is a classic Western.  Anyone who loves Westerns does or will love this film.  The three main actors are all memorable, the story is engrossing, and Sergio Leon's direction is excellent.  The cinematography is superb, ranging from widescreen vistas baked under the Spanish sunshine to repellent close-ups of dirty bounty hunters and the like.  What I did not remember about this film is how incredibly huge it is!  Some of the location shots are extensive and a couple of the scenes encompass Civil War magnitude with thousands of extras(no CGI here, thank the Lord!).  Anyway, I could praise the film, the acting, and all that to no end...but this particular DVD package is fairly lame.  True, it is cheap, but the fact that the sound is only 2-channel is a big disappointment.  With only two of my five speakers blasting that most famous score had me a little deflated, to say the least. However, the picture quality is better than has been suggested, and there is a specail feature of 14 minutes of footage that was flitched off for the U.S. release of the film.  This film is very entertaining, and for the measely price they are asking for one could certainly do worse than this DVD.  Just be sure to wear headphones so you won't notice the 2-channel effect so much.  Take it easy.
B00006FDCD|3.0|I do agree with the high rating of this movie because it is one of the scariest, creepiest, horror films I have ever seen.  HOWEVER, I say that as someone who is terrified of clowns and anything having to do with them.  If you are scared of clowns, this movie is a frightfest that will keep you glued to your seat. (Under the safety of the nearest blanket as well, and all closet doors locked.)  If you are not really &quot;moved to chills&quot; by clowns then this one might not hit the mark for you.  It's an interesting watch to say the least.<br />My only problem with the movie (and with Stephen King's writing as a whole) is that it doesn't end well.  It's almost like the man gives everything he has to 90% of the book and then drops the ending.  He seems to do this with a lot of books, and those bad endings translate into bad movie endings.<br />My recommendation?  I always tell people that they will love the first 2-3 hours of it, but in all honesty they can skim through the last hour or so of the movie.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I am a huge fan of my chemical romance and I love both of their CDs. This one in definitely less hardcore than the previous one but it is still great and definitely worth buying. I definitely think that it is one of the best CDs I have ever purchased. I think what makes it so wonderful is how diverse each of the songs is. Each one is so different and stands out from the last one. I know that with many CDs you cannot tell one song from the next because they all sound so similar. This isn't the case for this CD. There isn't a song on it that I don't like. I couldn't even pick my favorite song because they're all so good. I HIGHLY reccommend going to pick it up.
B000089RVR|5.0|The new Dido CD is completely stunning. Some of the best songs on it are:<BR>White Flag<BR>Stoned<BR>Life For Rent<BR>Mary's In India<BR>See You When You're 40<BR>Don't Leave Home<BR>This Land Is Mine<br />The whole CD is amazing, but those songs are the highlights on it. Not that the rest aren't, don't get me wrong, the album is completely stunning. Absolutely brilliant. A must have for any persons CD collection.
B000002KNI|2.0|The idea of a reunion might seem romantic, especially if we are talking about the best duo that pop music have ever created. Anyway, here the problem is not the noble intention but the execution. The band backing the sublime S&amp;G's voices and guitars is awful. The choice of instruments, with all that keyboards and horns ruins the simple melody and essential instruments backgrounding the original songs. So, if you want to know better the music of Simon and Grafunkel, PLEASE!, don't buy this &quot;illusion&quot;. If you absolutely need a collection, try the 2CD of TALES FROM NEW YORK (THE VERY BEST OF) instead (but I think it's a european-only release).
B000084T18|3.0|Ok, this album is a little overrated but it's a good debut but really so, the album has some catchy beats that grab you into the songs, but &quot;get rich or die trying&quot; is not all filled with radio friendly tunes for the ladies, matter of fact, there are some hard-core tunes like &quot;many man&quot; and &quot;dont push me&quot;, On the negative side 50 cent's lyrics need work and his voice can be annoying, sometimes I have trouble trying to understand the words coming out of his mouth, lyrically 50 cent is nothing, but lyrics are not everything in a song.<br />Production: beats 9/10.....lyrics 3/10<BR>Favorite tracks: what up gangsta, many man.
B00005JKED|5.0|This excellent movie features an award-winning performance by Denzel Washington that broke the molds of political correctness that have shackled America for 30 years or more. it could have been better only if John Millius directed it. Outstanding in every way. A must buy!
0553382179|5.0|I would like to comment on the editorial review of this book.  I get the impression that the editor does not do much research. If they had, they would have known the many thousands of people and their families who have benefitted from Marla and her team's ideas.  It has nothing to do with &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; or anything of the sort.  It has to do with accepting yourself and growing outside the box of &quot;perfectionism&quot;.  I am a business woman with a family who now has time to enjoy life and loved ones because I am not a &quot;martyr&quot; anymore.  I don't think June Cleaver would have deligated responsibilities to all members of her family like I now do.  I'll bet even the editor could use a little &quot;flylady&quot;!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|WOW! I'll admit that I never was a diehard Slipknot fan, and while I own and enjoyed both &quot;Slipknot&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot; as well as the pre-Slipknot album &quot;Stone Sour&quot;, I never did really fall in love with any of them.  I will also admit that if asked to choose between Slipknot and Stone Sour I would probobaly choose Stone Sour.  With all that said I would like to say that, due to this album, I now LOVE Slipknot. I've listened through it many times and I like pretty much all the songs. Needless to say, I think that this is Slipknot's best album and almost all of the complaints that I've heard about this album are weak, I mean who cares if it doesn't have a Parental Advisory(the lyrics are just as dark and brutal, just no swearing) and whats wrong with an acoustic song here or there(It's not like the heavy songs still aren't present-see songs like &quot;Welcome&quot;). I actually enjoyed the acoustic songs(&quot;Circle&quot; and &quot;Vermilion Pt. 2&quot;) as well as the other more mellow songs(&quot;Prelude 3.0&quot; and &quot;Danger-Keep Away&quot;).  It seems to me that Slipknot has finally decided to show that they have the talent to write diverse songs, put them together, and make it work well.  Overall I think any metal fan would enjoy this album (and I don't just mean nu-metal fans, I mean ALL metal fans).  <br />As for the rest of you, don't write bad reviews(or good ones for that matter)unless you have listened to the album.
0312263120|4.0|This is the third Brown book I have read (Deception Point &amp; Da Vinci Code are the prior books).  Brown has an uncanny ability in all his books to bring the reader in at the beginning and put you on a roller coaster ride that you can't get off.  This book is no exception.<br />Brown seems to like codes and puzzles, which permeate all his books.  In this one, a programmer appears to write a cryptographic algorithm that even the NSA's most powerful computer cannot crack.  This most powerful computer, TRANSLTR, is a super computer that uses quantum principals to be able to \\"brute-force\\" any encryption key that can be written by man in no longer than a few hours.  If the NSA cannot crack the algorithm, then they will no longer be able to spy on terrorists and other bad guys, who can encrypt all their messages with this new algorithm (nicknamed Digital Fortress).<br />The programmer, who designed Digital Fortress, puts the algorithm out on the Internet encrypted with its own algorithm, so it is free to download by anybody and can be later used to do all their encryption, if they have the encryption key that the programmer set in the code.  The programmer offers to sell the key to the highest bidder, so there are several powerful individuals that are anxious to get the key at any cost.<br />The programmer keeps the key etched into a ring he is wearing.  Unfortunately for him one of the \\"anxious\\" individuals has him killed, but not before he is able to pass the ring off to some innocent bystander.  The NSA learning this sends a \\"school teacher\\" (David) to retrieve the ring and bring it back to them so they can break the algorithm.  The schoolteacher goes on a \\"treasure hunt\\" around Spain trying to locate the ring.  Unbeknownst to David, he is being trailed by the programmer's killer, who is killing everybody that David has spoken to.  The killer is waiting for David to track down the ring so he can eventually kill him.<br />Meanwhile, David's girlfriend Susan is tryingto track down a partner of the programmer, who might have a copy of the key.  Susan is a top cryptographer for the NSA and uses various programming methods to try to locate the partner's email account.  While this is going on, havoc breaks loose at NSA headquarters with a power failure and a lurking killer.<br />This book is not quite as good as the other two books I read by Brown.  One of the main problems that I could see coming a mile away is that the killer trailing David, efficiently disposes of everybody David has talked to.  When the time comes for him to kill <BR>David, he becomes totally inept.  I can't really fault Brown on this because this seems to be a popular thread in most thrillers.

B0000DG00B|4.0|The Allman Brothers appeared at a three day festival in Atlanta in 1970, opening the show -- and closing it, too.<BR> They were the first band on the bill on July 3rd. An excellent version of &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; starts disc one. Songs from their first two albums are highlighted. Shorter songs such &quot;Don't Keep Wonderin'&quot; are mixed in with longer jams such as &quot;Whipping Post&quot;. Berry Oakley sings lead on a killer verion of Muddy Waters' &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;. The band jams on an amazing &quot;In Memory of Elizebeth Reed.&quot;<BR> During &quot;Mountain Jam&quot;, a rainstorm hit, forcing the band to stop for half an hour. When the storm passed, they continued the epic song, right where they left off! Cool!<BR> The band took the stage again on the night of July 5, but not until 3:50 a.m.! The second set (disc two) contains some of the same songs as the first. A good version of &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; is the only song from the second disc that isn't on the first.<BR>Despite the duplication, it is still a good set. Johnny Winter joins the band on guitar for a concise, exciting version of &quot;Moutain Jam&quot;. <BR> My only complaint: this should have included all the songs from both sets. It may have required another cd to do that, but it would have been worth it. Both versions of &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; seem to be edited for time. Perhaps the second one should have been uncut, and the first one bumped to make room for other songs. <BR> Otherwise, this is a good live set from the Duane Allman and Berry Oakley era lineup.
0689835604|5.0|This was one of the first books given to our son.  We loved the cute pictures and wording of the book.  Our son is now 15 months old and still loves to find the different things on the baby.

B000002AGB|5.0|This double cd highlights The Who's appearance at the 1970 Isle of Wight festival, and is a worthy purchase. <BR> The show was running late, resulting in The Who not taking the stage until 2 or 3 in the morning. But they still played with all the energy of an earlier show.<BR> First, the band runs through several hits, such as &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, &quot;I Can't explain&quot;, and &quot;Young Man's Blues&quot;. Two songs that were still new at the time (&quot;I Don't Even Know Myself&quot; and &quot;Water&quot;) are next. Most of the songs from &quot;Tommy&quot; are next, and the show wraps with a few more classics, such as &quot;My Generation&quot;.<BR> All the performances here are excellent. Recorded the same year as &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;, this cd makes a terrific companion to the &quot;Leeds&quot; cd. The Who clearly blew away the audience that night. Roger Daltry was at the top of his game with his singing, the rest of band's playing was thrilling. In fact, the only reason the show ended was because Pete Tomnshend's guitar accidently (!!!) broke. <BR> The show remained in the archives until 1996, when it was finally released. Better late than never. Fans will want to add this album to their collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a certified fan of Joss Whedon, that celluloid genius who brought us our very favorite vampire slayer.  I own all the Buffy and Angel DVDs and even read Whedon's comic book work, from Fray to the current Astonishing X-Men.  But I stayed away from Firefly when it was on the air, for much the same reason I'd never watch the original Buffy movie: I knew it was going to fail.  Just as I knew that the 1992 movie would only disappoint me, I knew that Firefly would not succeed commercially.  There was no way, in this ever-more homogenous Bush-supporting society, that a Joss Whedon show would survive on a network.  I thought that it was better to stay away than to be left with a huge gaping hole in my side after only a few episodes.  Now, after watching the DVD set of the 14 episodes that managed to be completed, I can't help but feel remorse.  Firefly, and I will take much flak from the Whedon community for saying this, is the Buffy's creator best show.  It's better than Buffy and Angel.  Buffy and Angel, while spectacular television shows, both sometimes hit snags in terms of consistency.  See Season Four of Buffy and Season One of Angel for further details.  This is because, while those shows were the product of a concept, a cool, flash-in-the-pan idea that Whedon's mind hatched, Firefly is the show he has always wanted to make.  Every frame and every line of dialogue is the realization of a talented filmmaker's ultimate wet dream.  You get the feeling that Whedon imagined every single aspect of Firefly long before he ever started typing on his iBook.  This is a fantastic show.  It is an absolutely complete body of work, although it's only 14 episodes long.  Firefly is Whedon's love letter to all of his influences, from sci-fi to westerns to good old character-driven drama.  The cast and crew coalesce to help Whedon achieve his vision and are all fantastic.  The way the show is shot and lighted give the viewer a very obvious visual clue about the show's message: history always repeats itself.  Nothing ever really changes and people should stop mistaking technological advancements for true human evolution.  I love the zooms and the &quot;imperfect&quot; special effects style, complete with lens flares, poor lighting in places, and various other supposed no-no's.  The staff, which included familiar faces Tim Minear and Jane Espenson, are of course reliably brilliant.  The sets, by old Buffy alum Carey Meyer, really betray the show's budget with a very real sense of space (especially the ship).  There's also the actors, who I think are just an amazing group of nine very individual talents.  Nathan Fillion exudes both confidence and hopelessness in every scene and is hilarious when paired with &quot;Saffron,&quot; the recurring con artist played by Christina Hendricks.  The &quot;strong woman-chicken&quot; couple played by Gina Torres and Alan Tudyk drive both actors to play each scene to the nines, although I wish we would have seen more of their very complex yet beautiful relationship.  Adam Baldwin is perhaps my favorite as Jayne Cobb, the beefy action hero who is despicable but also very much a man-child.  Ron Glass is the definition of dignity as Shephard Book, whose mysterious past would have been one of the juicest plot lines had the show been allowed to continue.  Sean Maher and Summer Glau share a kind of sibling love that is so realistic, with Maher taking the role of the ship doctor beyond the confines of any Trek.  Glau, in her first substantial acting role, makes Brittany Murphy look like a hack with a truly difficult character that she nails consistently.  Morena Baccarin, in the role of companion Inara, demonstrates a truly complex feminine strength that is rarely seen on a landscape littered with Bachelorettes.  Finally, there is Jewel Staite, who never confuses innocence with stupidity and brought much-needed heart to the show.  Favorite episodes include &quot;Serenity,&quot; the intended pilot, the hilarious &quot;Jaynestown&quot; and &quot;The Message,&quot; which gives the term plot twist a new meaning.  &quot;Out Of Gas,&quot; however, might just be the finest hour of television I've ever seen.  With a movie due out spring of next year, here's to hoping that all the bottom-line obsessed suits will not &quot;take the sky&quot; from us.
B0002234LS|5.0|'Secret Window' is without a doubt a fantastic movie that was based on probably the most proclaimed horror writer and acted by the greatest actor. I was skeptical about the movie before I veiwed, but I was hooked within the first moment. 'Secret Window' is a film masterpiece that builds all your empathy and pity for one character and then throws a twist that will leave you guessing until the end of the film. Johnny Depp's best performance since 'Pirates of the Carribbean'.
B00005JLR8|5.0|This is a film that you watch and at the end you ask yourself \\"what did I just see?\\" and you want to know more. You want to know why it played so strongly on your emotions and you want to hear the message it just gave you more clearly.<br />This is a film about the director's own family and the pain of the loss of his own brother and eventually the triumph over the past. For as well made and acted as this film is - and it is superb - it is also cloaked in mystery that is never wholly answered. As Sheridan states in his commentary, he didn't control the whole, he let much just happen - the 6 year old actress, Emma, literally casts the older role with her sister and helps direct the film. And the director's own children help write the screenplay. So the film ends up being more intimate and the commentary more revealing. There is a beautiful contrast between the innocence and belief of the young against the pain and confusion of the father. The film presents a picture of fatherhood, of love and escape from grief.<br />Buy this film to escape from the thin thrills and shallow plots of typical Hollywood fare. We all enjoy that stuff at times, but sometimes you want some reality which isn't contrived.
B00029LNHS|4.0|This CD shows the wide variety of styles that the Black Eyed Peas can pull off. &quot;Labor Day&quot; and &quot;Lets Get Retarted&quot; are songs that just wanna make you groove, while songs like &quot;Shut Up&quot; and &quot;Fly Away&quot; take advantage of the great vocal ability of Fergie, and &quot;Anxiety&quot; sounds like something from a Linkin Park CD. The Back Eyed Peas have a good handly of many different styles and this CD uses all of them. The reason this doesn't get 5 stars from me is because the most recognizable songs, (Hey Mama and Where is the Love) have different versions on this CD that , in my opinion, are not as good as the radio edits. All in all, a good buy to add to anyones collection.

Rage's lead guitarist use his own guitar and hands to make incredible noises like what the turntables do . Limp Bizkit is bit more rap then rock . in rock your supposed to scream out the top of your freaking lungs but this bands are melodic and rap focused band . it was a good thing for wes borland to leave the band cause the band was going no where but being stupid . with their new guitarist , Limp Bizkit has gone down teh drain and never will rise up again . without Borland there are nothing <br />Bring the heat from the revolution of Rage . the only band that is a close match to Rage is System Of A Down . but Slipknot are the godfathers of the current Nu-Metal industry
0440241413|4.0|I had heard many recommendations for &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; and finally, I decided to get a copy!  I had no idea what the story was about before I read the book -- I must say, it surpased my expectations! I finished the novel in a day and a half, i found it very easy to read, never wanting to put it down.  It was a very enjoyable book to read. I think we all have a little shopaholic in us, understanding the main character Rebecca's point of view. This book is definitely worth reading!
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Another highly anticipated movie that ended up disappointing me.<br />Based on the reviews I read, it was my understanding that the stories were 1) supposed to be connected and 2) that most of the couples would receive equal (or something thereabouts) screentime.  While most of the stories were loosely connected to each other, some of them were hanging by a thread.  Also, some actors got much more airtime than others, although given the uneven performances, uneven exposure was not such a bad idea.<br />I groaned once Billy Bob Thornton came on screen as the US President- love the actor, but the word \\"caricature\\" with an arrow pointing to him may as well have come onscreen.  OK, some of our presidents have been lecherous, but I was under the impression that this was less annoying to the rest of the world than to us.  Yes, we can be bullies (and that's putting it mildly), but the level of sophistication in the exchanges between Thornton and Hugh Grant's Prime Minister was so lacking that I started wondering if I was watching a dream sequence.  By the time the juvenile and completely unrealistic press conference came up, I wished I had been.  And how romantic- important (though vague) political issues don't inspire the PM to stand up for himself and his country, but the ogling of the object of his affection does.  OK...<br />As for the young man who went to the Mid West to score (because all American girls like guys with British accents), I did not believe the scene where he makes it to (and in!) America was real until the end- when he wasn't revealed to actually be sleeping on the plane.  I guess it's somewhat comforting to know that even supposedly sophisticated British writers have the same kinds of ridiculous and adolescent fantasies that usually show up on straight-to-video releases intended for the high school crowd.<br />And what was going on with the body doubles?  The juxtaposition of their explicit jobs with their sweet innocence wasn't funny or cute after the third or fourth scene, just gratuitous.  Were they there to make some kind of commentary on the simplicity of love in a complex world (or vice versa)?  Maybe I could have gotten more out of the story if they had tied into anyone else.<br />Another disappointment was the storyline with Liam Neeson's widow and his stepson.  While they were probably the most deserving of a Hollywood happy ending, the setups were jaw-droppingly unrealistic.  Oh- you really can get the girl of your dreams by playing in a band.  And oh- heartache and tragedy will be rewarded with a Claudia Schiffer lookalike.<br />Not all bad, of course (or I would have given this two stars).  Laura Linney and Emma Thompson proved once again why they're considered A-list actresses.  Linney was heart-breaking as her character quietly descended into the numbness demanded by her role as her brother's keeper (although she clearly rose above the script- the writing was on the wall for her character as soon as she brought her date home).  Thompson gave the movie much needed realistic emotional depth.  The scene where she gets confirmation of her worst fears about her marriage (and then moments later whisks her family off for a Christmas function) were cringingly real.<br />Surprisingly, another storyline that made sense was that of the washed up rockstar and his manager.  Love, \\"actually\\", isn't just the indulgent, romantic or sexual- it can also be deep abiding friendship.  That the most decrepit character in the movie was the one to make that realization was poignant.<br />As far as fairytale, feel-good stories, Colin Firth's was the best.  Again, very little connection to the rest of the characters, but the chemistry between him and his Portuguese housekeeper made up for it.  And the best scene of the entire movie was probably when he made his broken-Portuguese proposal.<br />Finally, the storyline with the newlywed couple and the best friend felt unresolved (or unresolvable).  That should get it points for realism, but since 1) we had almost no insight into the husband and 2) we really didn't get to see enough of the wife or the best friend, it just felt unfinished and unsatisfying.<br />Good to rent, but not something I'm sorry I missed in the theaters.ts for realism, but since 1) we had almost no insight into the husband and 2) we really didn't get to see enough of the wife or the best friend, it just felt unfinished and unsatisfying.<br />Good to rent, but not something I'm sorry I missed in the theaters.
B000006TRV|5.0|This was one of the most important albums of my younger years. While not every song on this CD is great, the over all content is out standing. Comfortbly numb is by far the best trak. Although some odvious crazy people will say Britney is better because she sold a few more CD's, how ever I seriously dubt that we will be listing to her in 20 years let alone 10 years.<br />A great CD by one of rocks greatest bands. There is a reson this album still sells more then 20 years later.<br />UPDATE: Wow, look at little Britney now. How far she has fallen. Seems like her new CD is not selling so well. Funny how history has a way of putting thing right.
0316096199|3.0|I was a bit underwhelmed with 'The Lovely Bones' - started out great, lost me entirely by the end - but I expected great things of 'Lucky'.  Yet again it starts out well, the opening chapter is horrifying, moving and completely unputdownable - but as we move away from the actual rape and its immediate aftermath all Alice Sebold's faults as a writer surface again.  She seems unable to select material which will be of interest to the reader and fills pages and pages with irrelevant detail of her family life and unnecessary background detail. The book comes alive again when she spots her rapist in the street but in between I found myself losing interest.  We all know the argument about real-life not being as tidy as fiction - but in this case it WAS tidy - the rapist was identified by Alice, caught and punished (a much more satisfactory ending than that of 'The Lovely Bones', ironically). I wish the book had been more scrupulously edited to focus on the essential elements of her story rather than filled up with padding. I felt cheated at the end of the book - at the beginning I felt that I would be with Alice throughout her every step of her journey to find justice and recover from the trauma she suffered but somehow this connection was lost and by the middle of the book I had no idea what she - or indeed anyone else involved was thinking or feeling.  What a shame as this could have been a truly great book and an inspiration to rape survivors everywhere ...
0688152023|5.0|I have danced for 10+ years, and only took ballet for 6 months. This book definitely proves that ballet is indeed one of the most intense sports one can participate in. The exercises in the book are definitely written so anyone with no prior dance training can understand and execute them, but for dancers who are no longer taking classes, this is a must-have! Even with my current knee injury, I am able to keep in shape with this book. After a week of doing a pilates video, I switched over to the New York City Ballet Workout and noticed a change in my body the day after I began the book. The most important part of ballet, as is emphasized in the book, is controlling your muscles and being 100% aware of them. Ballet helps with posture, grace, and muscle strength, but only if one is consciously making the effort to change. That is the only forewarning. Don't expect everything to change automatically. You have to make the effort to be more aware of your body when you are out and about. This book definitely helps one to do just that. BUY IT!!!!
1592400876|4.0|The title of the book comes from the following joke:<br />A Panda walks into a cafe. He orders a sandwich, eats it, and then draws a gun and fires two shots into the air.<BR>&quot;Why?&quot; asks the confused waiter, as the panda makes towards the exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.<BR>&quot;I'm a panda,&quot; he says, at the door. &quot;Look it up.&quot;<BR>&quot;The waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds an explanation.<BR>&quot;Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.&quot;<br />This book is a study in punctuation: how people misuse it, how punctuation is supposed to be used and general lessons in grammar. Truss also covers the histories behind the main punctuations, such as the comma, the exclamation point, the dash, and quotation marks. What keeps this book from being as exciting as a block of wood is that the author writes eloquently with constant splatterings of British humor. Some of the examples she used to illustrate her points had me laughing so hard that I dropped the book! <br />My brother had recommended this book to me and at first I wasn't sure why -- I didn't think it was \\"my sort of book,\\" if you know what I mean -- but after reading just the introduction I was hooked. My only problem is that a lot of the names used for the punctuation marks are the British versions, although the differences are explained in the introduction to the book. Amazingly, I not only got a lot of good laughs out of this book, but I learned quite a bit as well. I can see now why this book has been on the bestseller lists for a while.
B00006879E|5.0|I love this CD!  I bought on a whim while I was on vacation, thinking it could be something to listen to on my way home.  I put it in and listened to Harder to Breath and This Love, songs I hear everyday on the radio.  Then I heard the rest of the CD and was completely blown away by how great it was.
B00004W52U|4.0|Wow, how can I be the first to review Operation Ivy?! Amazon customers are letting the ball drop.<br />Some website I visited once described Op Ivy well: &quot;Imagine if the Specials and the Clash were in one band - updated to the 80's and filtered through East Bay radness. That was Operation Ivy.&quot;<br />Op Ivy was a punk group with a bit of a ska flavor to them. They cranked out fun, raw, and bouncy music that you could sing along with and most definitely dance to. They didn't put out much, this album's about all Amazon's got.<br />If you like punk, punkish-ska, or just plain fun music, go ahead and grab this. It's worth it. Oh, and from the ashes of Op Ivy rose Rancid, so if you're a Rancid fan then definitely grab this (far better than anything Rancid's ever put out).
0671027387|5.0|I haven't read a book in close to a decade, since middle school. I was never into reading, I would have rather seen a movie then spend a week on a book. Well it all changed with this Author. My girlfriend just finished reading the Davinci Code, she praised the book left and right. It didn't however seem like the type of book I could get into, considering it was somewhat religious in nature and that just isn't my thing. When I went to the book store with her the other day I noticed this book and Digital Fortress. I read the backs and they seemed right up my ally. I have yet to put down Deception Point and cannot wait to start reading Digital Fortress. The story is so believable and wow I just can't put it down. Dan Brown hit the nail on the head and I can't wait for more books by him. Thank you Dan Brown, you opened my eyes to something more than mindless movies about the same thing over and over with different titles!
0671027344|1.0|I recently slammed another \\"coming of age book\\" for reverting to silly gendered cliches about teenage girls and boys: girls are self-mutilating suicidal anorexic doormats and boys come in two types: cool druggie pretty effeminate gay boys who are beat up, and mean insensitive football jocks who do the beating up. Never, ever, ever does a girl have confidence or engage in hedonism (drug use) rather than self-inflicted pain (cutting oneself, starving). Nor is a girl ever gay in teen lit--especially not a cool druggie pretty girl. In teen lit, a football player is never gay and an effeminate boy is never straight. Basically, I am so tired of the stereotypes. Sadly enough, this book is wedded to them. You have your cool gay boy, your sad boy narrator, and your Girl He Is In Love With (she has no identity of her own except her romantic trifles). In short, its tired and tiresome, and vastly overrated.
B000267JQK|5.0|I was big fan of the first version of the Disclaimer album back when it was originally released and the re-make was even better than expected.  The original tracks sound better than the orignals, and the new additions are a perfect addition to this allready great album.  Seether has a unique sound of there own, blending the today's rock sound with their own style.  The resulting product puts Seether next to the top rockers of today.  Look to see them making bigger and better strides down the road.  This album is filled with twenty tracks, only about three of which I would say are sub-par, that every rocker should hear at least twice.  The bonus DVD on its own is worth  buying the the CD again.  The DVD contains the videos for some of their best songs and a whole live show.  If you have a spare (...) laying around, do yourself a favor and make one of the best investments you will probably ever make.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|I bought this cd blind, knowing nothing of the artist, while wandering around the UK on holiday.  I needed something to listen to while driving, and the cover caught my attention.  The blend of rock, pop, funk, and metal is incredible and makes the entire cd easy to listen to.  I have my favorites, but I also enjoy simply listening to the tracks on random.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|when she brought out her first album I loved it from the begining; because of her sweet voice and her style.I thought that would be impossible to make something better, but I was wrong.she did it again!!!<BR>Im impressed for her improvement:her voice, her music style and everything.In few words:&quot;Under my skin&quot; is amazing.
B00008DDXL|5.0|Although I think that the third installment is atleast twice as good as this one,if not more,and about four times as good as the original,I'd still have to say that when it all boils down to it,that they're all very,very amazing movie's,and they all deserve a five star rating if not more.So be smart,and just decide for yourself.I wouldn't be mad if someone thought the second one is better than the third.As long as they don't do something stupid,and give part three one star or something.Because I do like,and think that this one has a much deeper storyline than the first,and intern show's Harry in a more heroic light,and not to mention that the end of the film was very,very moving.I remember after I got done watching it,I thought that there is no possible way that J.K Rowling,and her amazing crew could ever top this movie.Than I saw the third installment,and was litterally blown away.I mean those kid's are better actor's than an awful lot of adult's that I've seen.Plus I was worried what with the new director it wasn't going to be as good.But to me it was a much more lush,and beautiful film altogether.With an amazing storyline!Where everything that happen's in the story for no reason at all comes back at the end of the film to have a very important purpose.I mean it must be EXTREMELY hard to write something that has that many twists,and at the very same time has a huge amount of depth,and imagination.I think that people should definately buy all the film's.Especially part three.But it would be a huge loss to cut out any from the series!So buy this one the Chamber of secret's,and you won't be disappointed!!!!
B00018TI5E|5.0|I have been a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers since 1988, about the time John Frusciante took over on guitars. My favorite albums over the years have been the ones that I felt the emotional charge of the artist, and felt some sort of connection to the artist, or understanding through the lyrics of universal moments of life.<BR>    <BR>In &quot;Shadows Collide With People&quot;, I've finally felt moved once again by music. <br />Track 12 &quot;Time Goes Back&quot; is a good example of the powerful expression John Frusciante has found in using his musical talents and song writing ability in a way to make a simple and often used effect, such as the echo heard on the vocals, help convey the creation he hears and imagines in his head. <br />John's other solo efforts were also brilliant in their own right, especially considering they were self-produced, but on this album John seems able to tap more deeply into his imagination and share feelings and sounds that seem to come from a place far away, a dimension of purer colors and deeper harmonies.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I think the people that call this movie a kids flick are just a bunch of boring prudes.I'M 24,and I think that this movie's fun for any age.Sure it has some overly silly part's,like the ghost's flying around,and stuff like that,but let's not be so critical.The rest of the movie was really AMAZING!I give all of these movie's five star's!Although I do think that the second one's storyline was twice as good as this one,and the third one was twice as good as the second one.I think the movies just keep getting better.Now I don't really read the book's that much!But if the adaptations are good enough for the writer J.K Rowling,than who am I to argue.Plus I find it stupid when christian's hate these movie's when they sell The lord of the ring's movie's at their store's.I mean those movie's deal with Wizard's,Goblins,and an the evil eye.So being as they think there is no such thing as a good witch.Than they should all hate Gandalf,and not sell those movie's either.This movie is just good harmless fun.So I think that those people most likely haven't even seen this movie.For god sakes it has enchanted chocolate frog's that jump,and kid's that have funny backfiring wand's.Plus they collect wizard card's,and play a game called Quidich on their broom stick's.If that's not very imaginative,and harmless fun,then I don't know what is!If people get into witchcraft that's their own private perogative,but I can garauntee you,that if they say this really fun,and imaginative movie was their sole reason for doing it.Than they're most likely lieing.And if it did,than they should stay out of the theatre's all together,because they take thing's far,far,far to seriously,and literally...

B00008WT5E|5.0|Despite the fact that this album is one of the most underrated AC/DC albums out there, every track on this album is worth a listen, or most likely a few more. <br />the highlight songs on this album are:<br />Rock n Roll Damnation<BR>Sin City<BR>Riff Raff<BR>Gone Shootin<BR>Whats Next to the Moon<br />the production is raw, and this album shows AC/DC on a high pedestal. the lineup is:<br />Angus Young: lead guitar<BR>Malcolm Young: rhythm guitar<BR>Bon Scott: vocals<BR>Cliff Williams: Bass ----- his debut with AC/DC<br />Phil Rudd: Drums

0385336810|5.0|I just finished reading this book and have to say that it was just as funny as the first Shopaholic story. I loved every page of the book and could not put it down until I was finished. Now I am sad because I have to wait for a new Sophie book to come out! Hopefully we don't have to wait too long.<br />Anyone looking for a light summer read - definitely try this one out - even if you haven't read the Shopaholic series yet (although, you might as well buy them too!). Enjoy!
B0001D0FTW|5.0|One of the best metal cd's I 've ever bought!!Great riffs,great solos.I don't think there is much to say,to my mind edguy is one of the best metal bands in Europe and with luck (because talent is obvious and unegotiable)they have the potential to be one of the best bands in the world.

0790749815|5.0|By far Alfred Hitchcock's best movie.  About a man accidentally caught up in the world of spys.  Cary Grant plays a man sitting in a restaurant with some friends, he has the misfortune of raising his hand to get a waiter at the same time some men call out another's name.  He gets mistaken for a spy and is sent on a chase accross the country to 1.) avoid being caught 2.) Find out what the heck is going on and 3.) Fix what is going on.  There are many classic scenes like the crop dusting plane not dusting any crops but chasing after him.  And the Mount Rushmore chase scene.<br />Just a great spy movie with lots of action and twists up the backside.  You should enjoy it if you like movies at all.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|It's taken me awhile to fully process what it is that attracts me to the music of Franz Ferdinand.  Having fallen fully under their melodic spell way back in late March, after reading a favorable review in Q magazine and trying their music out, I've since processed the now-bountiful US and UK buzz that has come out with regard to this talented and promising musical artist.  Now I think I know why this album works so much.<br />First off, ignore the comparisons to The Strokes.  Sure, both artists seem to be reaching for the angular New Wave of the late '70s, but that's where the similarities end.  Franz Ferdinand are what The Strokes would sound like with a good lead singer, musicians who know how to play their instruments, and songwriters who know how to craft tight pop masterpieces.  So essentially they're nothing like each other.  In fact, if you wanted fairer and more accurate artistic comparisons, you'd have to jettison everyone in FF's peer musical group, comb music history and point out two darlings of the post-punk era -- Gang of Four and Mission of Burma.  FF are a less politically motivated Gang of Four (though one might want to debate the politics behind the gay-love song \\"Michael\\"), and are musically Mission of Burma's offspring (though for the most part are more lyrically complex than those Bostonian legends).<br />If you've spent any amount of time watching MTV2, then you'll know about the beauty behind The Single, \\"Take Me Out\\".  You will already know about how the abrupt change of musical pace in the song will redeem anyone's faith in the power of music to awe and inspire.  Much can also be said about other gorgeous and lush works of art on this album, particularly \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" (a low-fi dance-rock delight), \\"(Dark of the) Matinee\\" (the most enjoyable singalong since \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"), \\"This Fire\\" (a rewarding slow burn), \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" (smooth as silk), and \\"Come On Home\\" (which you WILL repeat about forty times in a row, guaranteed).<br />This album leaves you wanting more from this artist.  You will develop an addiction to the band, seeking out every single little b-side and live track you can possibly get your hands on.  You will hear the news about the band going back into the studio by year's end and want to drag them back in just so you will have the prospect of another album awaiting you.  And when The Strokes' fifteen minutes are over, you will wonder why on Earth they were ever compared to these far more wonderful (and stylish!) Glaswegians.  As a Duran Duran fanatic, I will testify that this band is the 21st century Duran Duran.  Get on board before this train arrives at the Smash Hits depot.
B00004W52U|5.0|i can believe im the first 2 review this album.. its absolutely amazing ne1 who likes punk rock/ ska/ dc for the right reasons would love this band its fast catchy crazy and intruiging its 1 of the best albums i own and this is definately 1 of the best bands ive ever heard
B00008972S|5.0|This movie is a must anyone who loves musicals, it's a total classic. If you thought you knew a lot about the movie, think again, because with all the extra fetures will provide you with more knowledge that you than think about.<br />The movie has definatley got some of the best dance seguences ever made for a musical.
0743454529|3.0|This is the first novel of Picoult's that I have read.  When reading the description of the plot (a minor who sues for medical control over her own body after 13 years of being used for blood and marrow donations to her sister who has leukemia), I was immediately taken in.  An added bonus, when I got the book, was discovering Picoult's narrative structure -- chapters are written from the point of view from different characters.<br />Picoult does an excellent job at character development.  I found that I was able to understand each character's motivations and was drawn to each of them as individuals.  And it is obvious that she does her homework in regards to both the complex legal and medical issues.<br />I was, however, very disappointed in the ending.  After spending some 200-odd pages taking the rollercoaster ride of emotions with each character as well sorting through my own feelings about truth and morality, I reached the culmination of the trial.  Her handling of the trial is emotionally rich, even if several of the issues that are raised are only done so cursorily.  Regardless, the verdict is given that is fair and appropriate.  I was excited to see what would happen *after* the verdict.<br />Instead, however, of attempting to implement the verdict in a &quot;real-life&quot; setting, Picoult ends the book with a plot device that indicates to me that she had run out of creative energy.  It enabled all the characters to have their stories all neatly tied up.  Very much a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending which does a large disservice to the bulk of the book where Picoult spends extensive time laying out the issues.<br />I have recommended this book to my friends, but with the very large caveat as above.  So much more could have been done with this book and the issues it raises -- I was disappointed in the cliche ending.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|I thought this movie was a piece of crap - the visuals were OK - but the story was dragging and boring as hell. You should definatly rent it not buy it so you can spit on the CD before you return it. - ruggedthug.com
0064407667|5.0|I keep buying books for my daughter, and its me that ends up reading the books. And its me that gets hooked on them.<br /><br /> I was in the doctor's office with my daughter, I had brought her this book, brought me a romance, and ended up reading her book once again. I had this series for over a year now, and thought with the movie coming out..She would want to read it. I just cannot tempt her. However, I am glad I read it...It was fun, and I had a good time reading it.<br /> Thumbs up to you  Lemony Snicket..I loved your book.
006092988X|5.0|Set in the early 1900's, a tree grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is an old classic we should all revist.  The reader continually finds him/herself cheering for the sterdy little girl who forms the main character of the book, Mary Frances Nolan.  <br />The book tells of the struggle of a typical family living in that time.  It shows the poverty, the happiness, the utter love for the opportunity that America provides and the pride that first and second generation immigrants felt at being in America.  Though Johnny Nolan, the witty, talented, drunk father of Francie, Smith shows how, even in poverty, a typical &quot;johnny&quot; enjoyed his freedom and opportunity in America.  Johnny's conversation with Francie about the opportunity to drive a car if you could afford it (chapters 25-6), not based on who you were, shows the real love of the American dream of getting ahead on your own merit.  Each such conversation is equally compelling and satisfying on the topic presented by Smith. <br />Smith's portrayal of the relationships that Francie had with her mother, Katie, her aunts, Sissy and Eve, and, in particular, her brother Mealy, are so well defined and understood.  Like  Dickens, Smith, through these relationships and personalities, has the reader identifying smilar characters in their own life. <br />A reader will really enjoy this classic and I would recommend it highly.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|RUBBER SOUL is the best album the Beatles ever did. This is because it breaks new ground musically and lyrically without straying from true rock & roll, and is where all post-1970 rock springs from. This album, the other British Beatles albums, LET IT BE...NAKED, and PAST MASTERS 1 & 2 are the essential Beatles library.
B0002DKCMG|4.0|*urotrip is just a flat-out hilarious movie.  In the realm of \\"teen sex comedies\\" it's got a lot of competition to face, but I think it holds its own just fine.  The four main characters are excellent, each living up to the stereotypes dictated by earlier forays into the teen sex comedy realm, but adding something new as well.  Supporting characters are generally pretty entertaining, especially the soccer hooligans (I always get that Business song stuck in my head when I think of that scene), Matt Damon's cameo as the lead singer in a pop punk band (easily the funniest part of the whole flick), and the regrettably cut scene with Joanna Lumley as the owner of a youth hostel.<br />The exclusion of Lumley's scene (you can see it during the credits, though, so it's not completely abandoned) is one of a few complaints I have with this movie.  I found the actress that played Mieke to be extremely boring and rigid, but she made good eye candy, which is really what they were going for in this movie.  Where the film fails the most, though, is that it starts off strong, then somewhere around the time that they end up in eastern Europe, it takes a turn for the worst, as the characters wake up out of their lives of reckless abandon and act more *gasp* mature.  Fortunately, there are enough laughs toward the end to make it completely worth your time to finish off the movie, and the beginning has some absolutely priceless moments.<br />The DVD package is great, too, with plenty of deleted scenes, some interesting commentary by the director and the writers, as well as the \\"party along\\" commentary where you basically get to listen to the writers get completely bombed while playing the Eurotrip drinking game.<br />Overall, Eurotrip makes a great addition to anyone's collection of teen comedies, and will find a space in your collection among American Pie, Can't Hardly Wait, and Road Trip.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|On REVOLVER, the Beatles threw the rule book out the window, and tried ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING, from the aggressive guitar-rock of &#34;Taxman&#34; to the childlike joy-ride of &#34;Yellow Submarine&#34; and the romantic ballad &#34;Here, There, And Everywhere.&#34; This CD is better than SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND because it's still truly rock & roll. This and the other original British Beatles albums, as well as LET IT BE...NAKED and PAST MASTERS, are the essential Beatles library.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|1. Me Against the Music (featuring Madonna)  excellent funky track that will keep you dancing all night :-) 9.5/10 <BR>2.

B0000024IE|5.0|This is a landmark in the hip-hop genre. Chuck D and Flava Flav really stick it to... everything in this masterpiece. The beats, the messages, the mood, it all adds up to an essential record. If you're looking to expand the variety of your collection, pick this one up.
B000068TPN|5.0|This film is fact based and true right down to the tears and, as some call it, &quot;cheesy dialogues&quot;. Some also call it clich&eacute;-ridden. But according to the those that were &quot;there&quot;:, We Were Soldiers Once ... And Young, is told from their perspective. General Moore agreed that the film was accurate especially in portraying the noise and the confusion on the battlefield.<br />And, according to him, some of those so-called Cheesy dialogues, such as &quot;tell my wife I love her&quot;, or &quot;I'm glad I could die for my country&quot;, were witnessed on the battlefield.<br />I have watched nearly every movie on Vietnam, even lesser known ones such as 84c Mopic. There are some very good ones and some not so good. But this one is tops in my opinion. If you haven't seen it, either rent or bye this soon-to-be-classic.
B000007T2Z|5.0|Wow. Such a great piece of work, especially for a debut. GYBE take their thoughts and skills into their first album to give off an apocalyptic theme, creating lush soundscapes and eerie noise effects generated by beauty of art. Although this album is only 3 songs long, it's still timely huge. Over an hour in total length, f#a# (infinity) is insanely worth the money for just 3 songs (since the shortest song on this is almost 17 minutes long anyway) HIGHLY recommended for people who are fans of Radiohead, Sigur Rs, Mogwai, you get the picture.
B00003CX9E|5.0|So many of the films that critics unanimously pick as the greatest of all time are overrated, confusing, ponderous, overly symbolic art pieces that leave viewers scratching their heads. The collective reaction is, &quot;What in the hell was the director smoking?&quot; Arty camera work and tons of symbolism and metaphors can never take the place of good acting, solid direction and, most importantly, a good script.<br />Much has been made of Citizen Kane's technical brilliance -- Welles' use of overlapping conversations, Gregg Toland's deep focus photography, set design that incorporates ceilings, etc. However, none of this would really mean anything if the film didn't have a great story and screenplay. Citizen Kane may be a triumph in filmmaking technique, but it is also a deeply engrossing story with characters we can relate to and sympathize with. Welles' Kane is a selfish, unhappy, overly controlling dictator who has everything and yet still manages to make himself more and more unhappy. Most of us know the feeling of not appreciating someone or something good in our lives until he/she/it is gone. We see the promise and idealism in Kane's early life, like him and believe, as Joseph Cotten's Jed Leland does, that Kane is a great man who can do so much good in society. As Kane's life progresses, however, he becomes more and more bitter, alienates everyone who cares about him and dies alone, longing for the simplicity of his early life before he became wealthy. When Kane, as an old man, loses control when his second wife Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) leaves him, we can't help but feel for him -- even though most or all of his unhappiness is his fault. That the audience feels such empathy for such a flawed character is Citizen Kane's greatest triumph and is the true basis for Kane's reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I can only describe this album in few words, since there is so much to describe it with, it's amazing. Absolutely stunning. The violin bow added to the guitar playing is just great. Beautiful, melodic music. A good buy, and a classic to keep in your collection
B00005B36H|5.0|This is actually my first Tool album...Of course, I've heard bits and pieces of their previous stuff before, and while some of that stuff might have been a bit more catchy, songs like Sober and Prison Sex, the overall feel of that music isn't as hypnotic as this release.  This is one of those albums that you can just put in player, sit down to play video games, or do internet stuff, and you just become mesmerized by the music.  You don't really care what song it is because they all sound pretty much the same, but hey that is a GOOD thing.  A very long album as well which is also a good thing.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this album.  Great mood.  Great atmosphere.  Excellent musicianship.  This is a masterpiece.  Best rock album of 2001.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears most certainly did do it again!  Her second album, the teen-pop Oops!...I Did It Again, broke records for sales in a week for a female.  Though her vocals haven't seem to have gotten any better with age one still can't deny the addictiveness of Miss Spears.  This disc definitely should've won a Grammy for Album of the Year, and not just had been nominated.  Oops!...I Did It Again is a pop listener's dream come true, possessing everything necessary to make a great CD.  In my opinion every tune on this album is a possible Top 10 hit to say the least, with an exception of the Spears-penned &quot;Dear Diary.&quot;  I don't know what people are saying when they say this girl can't sing!  It's a fact the majority of people saying that are jealous of this talented chica, so admit it folks...Britney has that IT-factor (note: The hard-to-please American Idol judges agree too) no matter what you say.  Sure, her voice isn't anything near Christina's but it's still got its uniqueness that nobody else in today's music business possesses.  Flip the radio on and you know it's a Britney.  This record - along with La Brit's Grammy-nominated debut - is definitely a classic of pop.  Keep singing, Britney Spears!  I love those throaty chops of yours.

I hope Tim expresses his poetic genius again very soon!
B0001CCXY8|5.0|First of all, amazon.com seems to me NOT to be a logical site for people outside of the DEATH METAL WORLD to come here and write a review for the Corpse when this is usually their first time they've heard their gruesomeness, or that they listen to nu-metal which is in fact a descendent of death metal, black metal, and grindcore put together into a slow, 4-chord average song, high-pitched screaming lame and boyish attempt at being brutal, which will never match the gutgrinding barrage of blood and pus that spews from the orifices of the masters of gorified splatter ejaculating death metal!!!<BR>      THIS IS THE END OF THE NU-METAL FAN REVIEWS ON DEATH METAL, or, in fact, NORMAL people reviews on death metal who don't have a taste for their dissections of guts and brain organs. <BR>      No technicality in Cannibal Corpse?

B000000OQF|5.0|At the time Appetite came out, matel was pretty much a joke, with cartoons like Motley Crue making hit songs. Nobody notice Appetite at first, not even when &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; was released for the first time. When a little ballad called &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot; came out it propelled GNR into the spotlight. Here's how the album stacks up:<br />1. Welcome to the Jungle 10/10- Amazing hard-rocker with amazing guitars, vocals, and bass. It is easy to hear the influence of Zeppelin (can anybody say &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;?), it is still a towering rock masterpiece.<br />2. It's So Easy 6/10- A step down from the first song, is better live than in the studio.<br />3. Night Train 6/10- A good enough song, but not memorable.<br />4. Out Ta Get Me 9/10- Even with the unnecessary obscenity, this is still a great song. Driving guitars and screaming vocals make this song worthwhile.<br />5. Mr. Brownstone 10/10- A masterpiece about heroin addiction, boasts an impressive guitar solo by Slash and a tune that stays in your mind and gets better with every listen.<br />6. Paradise City 10/10- Outstanding song with great lyrics and great performances by the entire band. A true rock masterpiece.<br />7. My Michelle 9/10- A haunting intro leads into pounding guitars and booming vocals by Axl. Sad, chilling song could a been a fourth single.<br />8. Think About You 7/10- Is to this album what &quot;My Girl&quot; is to Aerosmith's Pump. Okay song but seems unnecessary.<br />9. Sweet Child O' Mine 10/10- The song that put Guns N Roses on the map, has a good opening riff, but doesn't become memorable until Slash uses the wah-wah pedal. The last 2:00 makes this song go from great to masterpiece.<br />10. You're Crazy 8/10- More unnecessary obscenity, is still a fast paced song with good guitars.<br />11. Anything Goes 3/10- Terrible song, the only bad one on the album. Extremely annoying, should still be collecting dust in Izzy's basement.<br />12. Rocket Queen 8/10 Good guitars in this two part song. The woman's orgasm in the middle makes me more uncomfortablethan turned on. It's a good enough song, but a poor ending song.<br />If you are a fan of hard rock, metal or any of those modern bands that call themselves metal, such as Korn or Limp Bizkit, do yourself a favor and buy Appetite for Destruction and learn what a real good guitar solo is.wo part song.

B000089RVR|5.0|Once again, a gentle tribute to love's pain and freedom. So sweet. But you might not want to listen at work, particularly &quot;See the Sun.&quot; It hits me hard... and I'm a dude. Yikes.<br />True to &quot;No Angel.&quot;<br />tes
B000002UAX|5.0|These are just some of the adjectives to describe this amazing collection of music. The first time you listen to it, you probably won't be able to stop, and it remains fresh after all these years because despite some familiar songs this actually has some of the Beatles' lesser-known material (still, we ARE talking about the Beatles). After a year and a half, what a follow-up to Sgt. Pepper (not including Magical Mystery Tour which wasn't a full album at first). The White Album, or THE BEATLES as it's properly called, has a reputation for simplicity following the heavily produced psychedelic output of 1967. True, there's a lot of straightforward rock and quiet acoustic ballads, and the production is much less adorned, but it's not quite \\"simple.\\" There's an astonishing range of music here. Honey Pie sounds like it came straight off a 20's record. Back in the U.S.S.R. combines good old fashioned rock and roll with Beach Boys harmonies and really clever lyrics. Blackbird is as acoustic as they get: Paul playing his guitar with a metronome ticking in the background. That's it. Helter Skelter on the other hand is probably the heaviest Beatles song, showing they could rock hard if they wanted to. Long, Long, Long, which has caught on with me recently, is a beautiful George songs, with that transcendent quality he was able to bring to pop so easily.<br />The last three songs on the album were written by the Lennon half of Lennon/McCartney. It's a fascinating indication of how much John was opening up in his songwriting. He'd always been a personal singer, even from his earliest songs, which had a morose, introspective air. But now, with the influence of Yoko, he is baring his soul as honestly as he can. Cry Baby Cry is surreal, said to be influenced by Syd Barrett, and expresses a skewed, very unsual perception of reality. It's followed by what sounds like Paul singing, \\"Can you take me back where I came from, can you take me back home...\\" The perfect introduction to Revolution 9 which, contrary to public opinion, is essential to the White Album. Some interpret this aural collage as the \\"sound\\" of a revolution, of chaos turning over society; while it's also been read as the story of John's life, including a baby crying and the eventually the voice of his new lover, Yoko Ono. In fact, Revolution 9 is probably more abstract than that, but it is definitely more than just a random assemblage of noise. It feels more like a journey into the subconscious. Finally, the album closes with one of the perfect album closers of all time, Good Night. This lushly orchestrated number is sung by Ringo, but written by John as a lullaby for his son Julian. After what's come before, this is an excellent, comforting send-off.<br />In 1969, John would tell the other Beatles he was leaving the group, a dozen years after he'd met Paul during a Quarry Men performance at a garden party. And so just a year before \\"the dream is over\\" we can hear the Four going the separate ways on this album. Some songs are indeed solos. But this is still a Beatles album, and it's one of the best. It showcases the individual Beatles' talents, but within the context of the group. When I listen to it, I picture a rotating stage: as the notes of one song die out, a new Beatles is revealed and begins playing his number.<br />My favorite songs here: Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da. Just pure fun, like an early Beatles song with more musical sophistication and storytelling lyrics. Life does go on.../While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Truly a classic, this may have been the first irrefutable proof that Harrison could be just a good a songwriter as Lennon-McCartney. It's even got Eric Clapton playing fifth Beatle for a day as he lays down the solo./Happiness is a Warm Gun. More than just an exploration of different rock and roll styles, it's a creepy, edgy, ironic ode to drugs, sleaze, sex, and violence. Check out the raw version on Anthology 3; it's really great./Rocky Raccoon. This is just a fun Paul song, telling a humorous story with a hummable tune./Julia. Touching tribute to John's mother with some references to Yoko (ocean child)./I'm So Tired. First he was only sleeping, now John's an insomniac. The chorus is great./Martha My Dear. Great piano playing, this is an underrated Paul opus./Mother Nature's Son. A quiet, relaxing ode to the great outdoors...Ok, I'm going to stop here because this could go on and on. Every song on here is essential; without a piece of crap like Wild Honey Pie the album would be less sprawling, and we can't have that now, can we?<BR>6/6
B000006YYM|5.0|1974's &quot;The Power And The Glory&quot; was the closest Gentle Giant ever got to mainstream success, as it remains their only album to make it into the US Top 50. It is also their masterpiece. After five albums of mostly intricate progressive rock, Gentle Giant simplified things *just a bit* for &quot;The Power And The Glory,&quot; making an album that still contained the classic Gentle Giant prog rock sound of yor, but also had a refreshing, slightly more accessible, mainstream feel at the same time. Giving the listener the best of both worlds, the band came up with their greatest album to date. Several GG classics on this one, including &quot;Proclamation&quot; and &quot;So Sincere,&quot; the very beautiful &quot;Aspirations&quot; and &quot;No God's A Man,&quot; and the fun &quot;Playing The Game.&quot; The band sound truly inspired on this one, their performances outstanding. &quot;The Power And The Glory&quot; is Gentle Giant at their very best.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System's third release &quot;Steal This Album&quot; is their best to date.  Not to slight their two previous masterpieces, but &quot;Steal This Album&quot; is simply incredible.  The album starts out with the head bangin' Chic'n Stu which starts out talking about food, but it's real meaning comes out when it bashes advertising.  As the album progresses with jam after jam, a track comes on called Mr. Jack.  I personally love the song because it hates on the police.  Later in the album you hit tracks like &quot;Pictures&quot; and &quot;Ego Brain&quot; which are just all great songs.  Towards the end you hit a song called &quot;Roulette&quot;.  This song has NO electric guitars, no drums.  Just instruments and great harmonizing by Serj and Daron.  The song actualy shows that these guys actually know how to play their instruments unlike some bands who just play HARD all the time and really can't tell if they an play or not.  The album closes with &quot;Streamline&quot; another great song.  All in all, you can play this album from songs 1-END.  It's easy to rate this album 10/10 just like their two previous albums.  I'm just waiting for their new album to come out, whenever that may be.  Buy this album now.
B000001Y5J|4.0|Sandwiched between Trent Reznor's's groundbreaking techno-rock debut Pretty Hate Machine and the critically acclaimed, conceptual masterwork The Downward Spiral, Broken offers little of the aforementioned albums' diversity but enough intensity to make up for the fact ten-fold. <br />Consisting of only eight songs, one of which is a cover of Adam Ant's &quot;Physical&quot; and still two more of which are instrumentals, including the cool opener &quot;Pinion&quot; (blessed with an even cooler video), this gem's strength lies in it's virulent catharsis. Moreso than most other &quot;industrial&quot; acts, many of whom grow stiff and cold behind their machanically accurate grooves, NIN tears at it's listeners with an intensely personal feel brought to life through a raging wave of sound that often feels more organic than electronic. <br />&quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;, the centerpiece of this EP, begins confidently with a violent &quot;Slave Scream!&quot; and rolls on as a loud decleration of self-loathing, a subject often visited by NIN and it's many imitators but perfected here. Elsewhere, the Grammy-winner &quot;Wish&quot; bristles with a creepy take on the unruly grind of punk while &quot;Last&quot; entrances through ridiculously catchy guitar riffs and bouncing melodies. All in all Broken manages to better capture it's target theme than Pretty Hate Machine. Of course, some of that is thanks to Reznor's new familiarity with the recording process and perhaps a bigger budget, but alot more can be attributed to a less constrained attitude towards music and, of course, Trent's dissagreements with TVT. We should all be grateful he's not one to let conflicts die without moaning alot in the process. <br />As neat as Broken is, it gets better. The Downward Spiral harnesses the guitar driven anger here and enhances it with a potent combination of subtlety and atmosphere. Further down the line, The Fragile emerges. Don't let some of the reviews here for NIN's earlier records fool you. The Fragile is Trent's masterpiece, an epic work of unrivaled grandeur and a musical vision so beautifully realized the results are surreal. Get Broken, enjoy it, and find comfort in the knowledge it's only one chapter in the history of one of music's most captivating stars.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I personally loved this movie, even though it was a little confusing i really liked it. I thought the plot was good and how it made you think he was still going on with his life, but in truth he was have a vision of what would happen if he happened to break away from what was destined for him. The only thing that truely confused me was with the plane when it did loose its engine. I also like the effects, like how it showed those things coming out of them and how that was where they were supposed to go and how frank showed him that in the end (if he did break away from what was destined for him) that he was supposed to kill him.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I just got done watching \\"Love Actually,\\" it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I was utterly disgusted! It made a total mockery of Christmas, with its ambiguous message--there was way too much sex and lasciviousness involved with the holiday celebrations. (Who in their right mind, dresses their kid up in some ridiculous lobster costume for the nativity scene?) It was blasephemous, vulgar, and completely gratuitous.
0767903862|4.0|In a Sunburned Country is a wonderful account of the sort of trip I would like to take to Australia. Bryson likes to walk and drive all over to see the neat things that make Australia unique-- marsupials, neighborhoods built without the pretense of architectural bias, stromatolites, giant fruit beside the road and, of course, Australians. (Among other sights, of course.) THAT is a vacation. Sitting on a beach or going shopping in a foreign city is for others.<br />Bill Bryson brings a silly yet worldly perspective to his travels. He isn't trying to sell Australia to me, and he just tells it like it is. And, he likes it.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|&quot;this is poopy. go buy blink-182, new found glory, good charlotte, yellowcard, and simple plan cd's instead. &quot; for people who say this... then you really shouldn't be listening to slipknot to begin with.... so how dare you rate something you obviously don't listen to. Don't judge something.. until you understand that style of music
B000003C2U|5.0|this is evolution...this is progression...this is CHUCK WITH DEATH!!! its all good baby..feel it and love it...its good<BR>flows well..and is fast as...well...you know what..its fast!!!
B00018D44U|5.0|What a pretty lady, with a beautiful voice!! All the songs are simply wonderful!!  I can't stop listening to Norah... she's the BEST singer out there. Right up there with the legends... Carole King and Barbra Streisand. This type of voice comes around only once in a blue moon. <br />Her first CD, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; was great, and this one is even better!<br />Go pick it up, you won't be disappointed. Her voice will soothe you in sooooo many ways... Each song will make you feel good!
B000000H66|5.0|this is one of deaths finest albums.  it is clearly a turning point in their carreer.  the songs are more thought out, and slowed down so-to-speak.  this is not your average metal album.  it is very creative, and atmospheric.  the catchiness is great, the songs flow well.  this is better than most albums, but the only hold back is the fact that roadrunner records was behind this one, and it got horrible recognition.  roadrunner is the epitome of all that is bad.  to them, death was just another dollar bill.  this album should truly be recognized 10-15 years from now, for its rawwness, and ability to take you on a ride.
B00005A46T|1.0|No eric your not the only one who h8s Slipknot. Ill tell you all as a musician they are, and always have been the worst band out there bar none!!!! <BR>All they do is make noise pollution. There are some some good death bands out there like Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir, but the difference is they actually have muscial talent and will be around far longer than Slipknot will be!!!<BR>I cant wait for Slipknot to split up - its only a matter of time! you cant go on making records of pure noise forever!!<br />I can recomend somthing better, all you have to do is : <br />Buy any CD in the world that hasent got SLIPKNOT wirtten in the front!!!
B00008EY65|4.0|Hellboy is a really good movie about a demon sent to earth to destroy everthing. His name: Hellboy. Since you all know the story, I won't get too much into that... Hellboy is really funny and has alot of great action sequences. Although the story doesn't follow the comic very well, its still very well done. I suggest this to anyone looking for a good action movie.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|This band are so rubbish it is untrue! All they do is make noise, they have no musical talent at all. They try to copy good death bands like Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir and In Flmaes but they arnt even close cos they just havent got a clue. They need to concentrate more on actually playing their instruments, instead of vomiting on the crowd and throwing sh*t around the stage! Hopefully they will split up soon and we wont have to listen to their wannabe nosie much longer. <br />TO THE FANS: get your ears mended<br />TO GET SOMTHING BETTER : <br />buy any CD in the world that hasnt got SLIPKNOT written on the front!!
B00005JN0A|5.0|Eurotrip is for sure, the best comedy film for 2004. I watched the trailer and I wasn't sure if this movie is going to be good. After, I read some reviews. Many say, this movie was pretty bad, and many others say this movie is great! So, I decided to buy it to make myself an opinion. The result was: the movie isn't great, but is EXCELLENT !! Loooonng time ago, I didn't laugh like that when I was watching a movie. There is too many memorable moments in the movie. Eurotrip beats Road Trip and American Pie 1 both in the same time. I probably watched fifty times American Pie 1, but I can guarantee you that Eurotrip is way better. Because, in this movie there is no boring moment. Each scene is good and you don't want to skip it to the next one. Also, the lengh is 1h30m and this is perfect. Because, I discover when a comedy movie lengh more than this... there will be some boring moment and even you don't want to watch it at the end because you are getting tired !!! Now, if I talk about the DVD special feature. The only one is good is the deleted scenes. The other bonus are: you see it one time, and you don't wants to watch it again. At the end, I recommand this movie because is soooo funnnny... this movie have everything to make a success. The replay value is very good. You can't just see this movie only a 2 or 3 times, because you will ask for more. Any American Pie 1 or Road Trip fan should get this movie. If you don't like these kind of movie, well don't see it because you will find it boring as the the two others. Probably, most for people in 10s and 20s ! For olders one, they will find it stupid unless if they like that kind of movie. see ya ... ! (warning: if you see this movie one time, prepare yourself to cry because is so hilarious and be ready to watch it ten times in a short amount of time!!) <BR>ZG
B000000H5K|1.0|the first sepultura album i heard was beneath the remains, and it was amazing. then i heard this crap, and it sounded like a completely different band. screaming to slow paced drums and guitars don't mix that well, and that tribal garbage is really damn annoying. it's good to be proud of where you're from, but don't put it in metal. Selling out to get the attention of the dumb ass mainstream critics is an insult to real fans of their thrash roots, plus real metalheads know that just about everything in the mainstream is about as watered down as metal can get. Very disappointing release. One other thing, that f***ing moron, dumbguy, i mean you, this band came before slipknot you dumbass, slipknot ripped them off because all they seem to do is scream. Also, slayer has been around for about 20 years, so don't even say they owe slipknot sh**. Plus, slipknot is rap metal, which was only created to make a quick profit off of ignorant 90's teens and is an insult to metal all together. So don't even mention slayer or pantera in the same sentence as a pathetic 9 member band.
B0001ENY6M|1.0|The Passion of the Christ music is almost as bad as the movie, and that is pretty bad.<br />The music has some semblance of good to it.  The movie is pure evil.
B00003Q43A|1.0|I wish I had the energy to try and describe just how awful this movie makes me feel, but, all I have to do is think about Randy Quaid's awful character or Will Smith's terrible lines or the fact that the President of the United States of America flies a fighter plane against alien ships, and I can do nothing but moan.<br />I saw this in 1996 and I've spent hours regretting the fact that I had contributed money to its cause. When I was at a friend's house not long ago, I saw a DVD copy of it on his shelf, so I made a joke about it being a &quot;steaming piece of pony loaf.&quot; He took offense to it, and actually tried to convince me it was a good movie.<br />Don't get me wrong: I'm all for a movie that knows it's bad and uses that as a device, a la Killer Klowns from Outer Space or Army of Darkness or something along those lines. But, when I watched this I could swear that someone actually took this idea seriously.<br />There is nothing good about this movie. Please, please don't buy this. You'll only be encouraging more movies like this.
B00028HBKC|1.0|this movie is sooo bad.  I wish I could give it negative stars.
B00008438V|5.0|This is one of the great 80s flicks, courtesy of the great 80s flicks guy, John Hughes. There are a hundred moments in this movie that flash me back to being an awkward 13 year old dork (as opposed to the awkward 32 year old dork I am now). And so many great lines! \\"Do you realize it's snowing in my room, godd**it?\\" Or when Gary opens the bathroom door and the cute girl asks, \\"What are you guys doing in there?\\" \\"Gary was just takin' a s**t!\\" *flash to a hand slapping Wyatt's face*<br />And, ya gotta love the bar scene, where a drunk Gary \\"tells his tale.\\"<br />Anyway, it's a funny, funny movie, and highly recommended to anyone who loves the John Hughes 80s. An essential!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|GnR has 3 albums.<br />why buy a best of when you can easily buy the originals,likely cheaper.<br />if you luv GnR get these.<BR>if not, bail.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Oh, man, I tried to find something useful to say about this movie, but all I can do is shake my head and wonder why this kind of movie exists. So empty and unsatisfying. So cold and improbable beyond even science fiction.<br />And adding to the pain is an excruciatingly bad Aerosmith ballad on the soundtrack.<br />Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay must be stopped.<br />Just stay away if you haven't seen it yet. Run screaming. Save yourself.

B00003CXMG|3.0|Whew. It's not often that I run across a film that is extremely annoying, yet also impossible to turn off. Yet, much like an Old Navy commercial, this film fits into this rare category.<br />There's something pre-9/11 about this movie's tone; some sort of vacuous innocence that wouldn't work in a movie made today. This gives the film an unintended shading of dated nostalgia, which is somewhat ironic, because the movie itself is about nostalgia.<br />How annoying is Kate Hudson? How bad of an actress is she? How many grains of sand are there on the beach; how many stars are in the night sky? Let's just say that, without her winning place in the genetic lottery, she would never have been given her role in this movie (or indeed, any other American film).<br />The editor of &quot;Cream Magazine&quot; is played in a nail-bitingly irritating manner; he'll remind you of any local, overweight, fifty-ish, burnout guys you may know who perform comic roles in your local community theatre and who can't stop talking about Iggy Pop. However, this may simply be superb acting on the part of the performer who plays the character, maybe the editor of &quot;Cream Magazine&quot; back then WAS a really annoying person; who can say?<br />Now, let's say you love the band Procol Harum, and you love the band Heart, jamming around with headphones on, blasting their music as you clean your trailer. Then, you will not find this movie annoying at all; in fact, you will love it.<br />The rest of us mortals -- well, let me put it this way: when you get to the part where they are all singing &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; on the tour bus with tears in their eyes, you will long to press the &quot;off&quot; button on your DVD player. However, some unwashed ghost of 70's rock will prevent you from doing so, and you will find yourself somehow watching this inane film until the bitter end (and somehow sort of liking it, too).

0452283760|5.0|I first read this book in 1986. It was the first serious piece of literature I read outside of school and it had a dramatic affect on me. I was struck by Howard Roark's unfaltering adherence to his values when society in general portrayed him as &quot;dangerous&quot; and a &quot;failure.&quot; While society happily jumped on the latest bandwagon without a second thought, Roark continued on his own journey even in the face of personal and economic tragedy. <BR>A self-proclaimed &quot;non-conformist&quot; at the time, this novel forced me to re-evaluate many of my beliefs. Was I truly marking my own path, or was I just conforming to a smaller group of outsiders? This novel does not attempt to prove that the &quot;good guys win in the end&quot; - so how far was I willing to walk my own walk?<BR>To this day, I am still asking those questions. I re-read The Fountainhead last month and found it no less profound than I first did in 1986. I can't help but picture Roark as the subject of Robert Frost's prose, &quot;Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.&quot;<BR>In the end, whether or not one agrees with Ayn Rand's picture of man and his role in society, The Fountainhead will stimulate thought and discussion - and in that respect, this novel serves its social purpose.
0060589272|5.0|A friend of mine loaned me this book, and I started to read it with no preconceived notion that I would like or hate it.  However, a few chapters into the book, I found myself incredibly identifying with the protagonist.  Much of the struggles and insights in regards to love, sex, pain, and pleasure parallel what I have experienced in my life, and it was especially affirming to read.  I enjoyed it and would suggest a read to anyone who has smoldering inside the desire for a rich, fulfilling life and is on the journey on finding out what that means for themself.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West. College Dropout<br />If I were to take a survey of all the current hip-hop that could be considered pop or mainstream, I would take a good 98% of what's coming out and say it was complete s***. Within that remaining two percent, I would take half and say it was solid, but nothing special. Then, in the devided one percent, there would be a few albums I would say succeeded at being popular AND creative. Within this top 1%, I place Kanye West and his debut LP - College Dropout.<br />In his album, we get a few things that other mainstream rap records lack. One - a story, two - a message (different), three - rhymes that artistically present the first two items, and four - ultra-tight production. Kanye, being perhaps most famous for his production and unique [at least in the mainstream world] style of turning oldies into remixed rap beats, shines throughout every track in creating quality instrumentals. From the carefully carried bass lines, to the skillful mix of drum sets, along with the oldie-distorted vocals, every track that Kanye creates is a gem in it's own respect. And while some are better than others, no doubt, there exists not one beat that makes me cry 'who made this crap?'.<br />Kanye West explains on one track his rise to fame, and through it, how he was often praised for his production abilities while pretty much ignored for his rapping. Understandably so, as Kanye West is not the best rapper out (yet), and is in his early learning days of MCing. But I have faith that in time, Kanye will become extremely fire in time as, for a first MC/Production album, College Dropout can stand with all the other hip-hop out. What supports Kanye's knack for-but-learning MCing, is the story he tells throughout the album. As the title suggests, he has strong views on school, which he makes known on more than a few tracks, including a number of skits. If you find yourself agreeing with the man or not, credit must be given to the humor, and applause for the boldness to put on such a touchy message as 'don't go to college, its useless'. Not that speaking your mind is bold, but that doing it on a mainstream level is often risqué. <br />He goes on to tell other stories about his physical struggle (his broken jaw), which surprisingly does not go sour after a few listens as one might expect. Other tracks go on to tell of experiences with God, another subject rare within mainstream hip-hop. And there is no shortage of straight flavor pop-tracks such as 'Slow Jamz', and 'The New Workout Plan'. But Kanye West's views prevail, and it becomes obvious West is not looking for just another singles album, as the popular and simultaneously well-thought 'All Falls Down' presents. He speaks not only of his views of the college-schooling system, but of the African-American struggle, and his own personal issues. Thanks to his amazing production, the story of whim avails to become a single!<br />College Dropout is full of all these things, and by far no shortage of guests appearances. Picking up people from his own ROC label, as well as the mainstream-underground: Comon, Talib, Mos, and of course a slew of resurrected oldie era vocals, the support behind West in his landmark first album is tremendous. There are no major problems, and as a first record, this can be viewed as a great culmination of talent, technique, and just plain juice. <br />9 out of 10
B00011RPB0|5.0|I would love to see your reactions to films such as L'Avventura by Antonioni or Two-Lane Blacktop by Monte Hellman.  Both films including Lost in Translation take a much more realist approach to the art of filmmaking; shooting on-location, using less polished/professional actors, allowing the script to be a guide and not a bible, allowing moments of silence to last uncomfortably long periods of time.  These films study not only the characters but the viewers.  You can dislike, even hate the film, for all anyone cares, especially Sofia Coppola.  But you cannot deny that it is a rare film that polarizes its audience to such extremes.  Great classic films are often called &quot;trash&quot; and &quot;a masterpiece&quot; with equal fervor.<br />Shockingly, the friends of mine whom I thought would hate the film absolutely loved it.  That is surprising for me.  Those same friends would probably have a hard time swallowing either of the other films I mentioned however.  It is a matter of environment, of taste and of different sensibilities.  <br />Lost in Translation forced my complete respect and admiration for Sofia.  She not only has the sensibility of her father when it comes to direction and vision but she has borrowed a page from her heritage and made a film that reminds one of the great Italian Neorealist era in cinema from the forties to the late sixties;  introspective, while being socially interactive.  Playing off the hunger for real people from the audience, real performances, real places and situations; well, what feels like real to the audience.  It explores the character through his/her reaction to the environment and allowing dilemmas and problems to either lay unresolved or allowing the audience to resolve them.<br />The end scene with the whisper is a perfect example.  These two Americans stand in a street in Japan where they could most likely freely talk aloud and not be understood just as they barely understand that world.  But he whispers.  Why is thatso important?  It points at you the audience and says, \\"Ha!\\" and it envelopes the idea of the story and the process of the film into an unpackaged whole - a kind of book where the last page is missing.  You are wholly aware of the story, the fact that it is a film, your emotions, the characters emotions but you are left to resolve it on your own.  The social interaction of the audience and the filmmaker is more important here than say a film like Castaway, where we are fully capable of sympathizing with the hanks character and we see him evolve and change and resolve his dilemmas and we are sure he will find his way even though we leave him at a crossroads in the end of the film.  He will be alright.  He will survive.  Our reaction to the characters in Lost in Translation is different.  We are left with a nagging suspicion that these two will never meet again and we will never know for sure what Bill Murray's character expressed to her.  The whisper is something that only the characters in the story share.  They will never repeat their \\"adventure\\" with anyone else, not even other characters in their story, so why is it a surprise that we are left out of the loop?  Because we feel involved, we feel invested and the whisper takes that involvement and holds a mirror t it.<br />I've gone on too long.  I just ordered this DVD and I will truly treasure it.  I hope that possibly seeing it a second time, maybe years later, for some of you will change your opinion but for now we agree to disagree because we can't have it any other way.<br />Ciao!
B000002UAU|5.0|I know this has been said before, but if there is any evidence that music can be a form of art this is it. This is some of The Beatles best work. Sgt. Pepper was the result of the experimenting The Bealtes did on Rubber Soul and Revolver. The result is mindblowing. It is second only to Abby Road, which is an amazing album as well. Words will never be able to do either album justice. The transitions between many songs are great, the WORST song on this album is 100 times better than just about anything played today. <BR>To any person who has said bands like The Beatles are outdated, or nobody listens to them anymore, you are all wrong. I love this music and I am only 15! If any of you would accually give this music a chance then you will love it. I know becasue I once dimissed The Beatles as old crap once myself. Now I hate myself for it. Give classic rock a chance and you will realize anything that MTV decides to play is horrible.
0553382179|3.0|Overall the FlyLady system is good &amp; can easily be modified to suit just about anyone's schedule.  Like everything there are pros &amp; cons.<br />*The suggestion of a daily 'chore/to do' schedule works well for me.  Some days more gets done than others - but I can keep better track &amp; reprioritize as needed &amp; as time allows.<br />*If you have a tremendously cluttered house &amp; don't know where to begin - this would be a great book for you.<br />*Nice selection of cleaning tips.<br />*Simple suggestions on how to reorganize that people can truly use<br />Cons:<br />*Everyone is encouraged to adapt the advice to your needs, but if you don't modify it to suit your lifestyle then it will just seem like way too much to do.  I think this is why many people get frustrated.<br />*I don't have a tremedous amount of clutter so a lot of it just doesn't apply to me.<br />*The cutsey acronyms/catch phrases, religious references, being told you must wear shoes &amp; have a shiny sink will not sit well with everyone.<br />*The web site offers just about everything the book does for free.<br />My 2 cents:<br />**Borrow the book from a library or check out the web site for free.<br />**Take what you can use from the system &amp; just leave the rest.
B000002U82|5.0|This is possibly the greatest album I have ever heard. It ranks up there with Sgt. Pepper, Abby Road, and The Wall. It is definantly the most complete album ever. Best heard when played from start to finish with no jumping around or breaks. Time is one of the best songs I have ever heard. Money is a classic and the guitar and the saxophone solos kick ass. Brain Damage / Eclipse is as good a one two punch to close out an album as you are going to get. <BR>If you also happen to own The Wizard of Oz, and this album, I sugest you play Dark Side, over Oz, while Oz is on mute. You start playing Dark side after the MGM lion rours three times. What you experiance next is incredible! I was blown away the first time i saw Dorthy step into Oz (the first part thats in color) and money starts playing. Some would say you have to be stoned to appriciate this, but i do not think so.<BR>I would also like to say to every person who has ever given a classic rock album, such as this, a bad review, saying it is out dated, or no body listens to it any more. Anyone who says this deserves to be shot! Well maybe not that extreme, but deffinantly bitch slapped at least for saying such untrue lies. I love this album and I'm only 15! Classic rock is by far the best music ever. The people who give it bad reviews seem to like this group of no talent lip-syncers: The Back Street Boys, who make me want to throw up. Brittny Spears, shes hot, thats it, no talent here. Justin Timberlake, about the same as The Back Street Boys, but this time its only one person making me run to the bathroom. Ect. It basically consits of what Carson Daily *Cough* TOOL *Cough* tells them to listen to. Bottom line, clasic rock rules, Dark Side of the Moon is one of the best albums ever, the best by Floyd at least, and popular music today sucks.<BR>(when i first posted this i posted it was a private post by mistake)
B00004XONN|5.0|this is the most experimentally ingenious and stimulating cd you'll ever lay your hands on. the first few times around it might be a bit awkward, especially for those completely conformed to radiohead's previous music, or those who don't really understand what music is all about. but after you've gotten grip and feel for his outlandishness, you'll realize it's more than just that. it's ART. finally radiohead has really gotten acquainted with the word music and shown it to us less open-minded people. buy this now and open your mind.
B0000640SA|5.0|This is one of the best, and by far, the most original movie I have ever sceene. Its hard to follow at first becasue the sceenes go in revese order, but that is one of the aspects that makes this movie interesting. Great acting jobs all around and once you think you know people in the movie, you are proven wrong! Each sceene keeps you guessing as much as the main character on how he got there and what happened right before hand. See it and be blown away.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is an example of yet another intelligent, different, dramatic, and funny show being cancelled because not enough people were even given a chance to love it. Cancelled after 11 episodes, this amazing blend of old Western and space themes was - and still is - one of the best shows ever created. I cannot wait for the movie to come out next year. I hope it proves to more people how great of a world this is.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|...but then again what colection of Beatles songs on 1 cd could! Every song on it is great but there are song singles that i would have ike to have seen on there that weren't *cough* Strawberry Feilds Forever *Cough* I was also disapionted to see nothing from the White Album made it on. Not even the version of Revolution that was on the same single as Hey Jude. This is a good cd that i would suggest for someone who is just getting into The Beatles. As for people who already have just about every other Beatles cd, i can think of a handful of other cds that are worth buying instead.<BR>I also saw a review for this cd that disturbed me. I think it was some person named Infidel that said John and Paul are just simply milking the fans for their money. This could not be furthre from the truth. First of all John is dead. He was sadly gunned down in 1980 by a man who asked for his autograph just an hour earlier. So I don't think John will be making money off the sales of this any time soon. Second in the late eighties, when the rights to all The Beatles songs were being sold, the combined effort of Paul and Yoko was outbid my Pauls friend at the time (the friendship did not last long after this) Micheal Jackson. As far I know, he still owns the rights to the songs. (probaly not for long, because he'll probably eventually have to sell them to pay his lawyers.)So Paul won't isn't making a dime off sales fo this cd either. I happened to take a look at some of Infidel's other reviews. This person made statements such as an album made by Stevie Wonder in the 70's was completly ripped off from a Justin Timberlake cd. So I personally, would not believe anything this person as far as I could throw him.
B000286RZM|5.0|John Frusciante absolutely blows me away with his musicality on every piece of music that he creates or collaborates on. This album is no exception. Every song is wonderful and the nuances that he adds show so much emotion. He is opening himself to everyone else with every note played and every word sung. John Frusciante is truly a beautiful and deep person. I recommend this and every other JF album.
B000066NW0|1.0|When i first heard the song Complicated, i did not like it. That was enough for me. Then a kid in my bunk that summer blasted it over and over and over again. That is how I came to dispise the song. I agree with Floyfian's view that this one star review will not change most things since MTV and Z100 control the musical thoughts of the magority of todays youth. Hell they even had a hold on me once..........when I was 7 and didn't know better! All I will say is that if you are interseted in finding out what punk really is then please, I am begging you people, listen to The Ramones!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|firefly has achieved cult status with only 14 episodes, 11 of which aired on television. fox made an horrific mistake when it decided to air \\"the train job\\" instead of \\"serenity\\" as the first episode for viewers to see. personally, i watched \\"the train job\\" and decided i didn't like firefly, so i stopped watching. i was disappointed, because this was a joss whedon product. i'm a true fan of buffy and angel and anything whedon, so of course i was expecting grand things from firefly.<P>fast forward a year and a half later. suddenly i'm hearing firefly is gaining cult status. how in the world? i ask myself.. oh it's on dvd? i read some of the reviews, and said to myself, why the hell not. so i bought the dvd.<P>and i watched it from the TRUE beginning, with \\"serenity\\" and let me tell you. i fell in love. fox made a horrific mistake of epic proportions when they aired \\"the train job\\" instead and cancelled it.<P>this is a true whedon show, balancing all the ingredients with each other: drama, humor, sex, mystery, and horror. the characters and the acting are first-rate.<P>at the end of 14 episodes, you will be left hanging. i just thank god that joss whedon is at work on the big-screen version, titled \\"Serenity.\\" it should be good! :)<P>episode guide:<BR>1 - SERENITY: fabulous episode (2 hours long) that introduced the crew to us and made us \\"connect\\" with them. 5 stars (out of 5)<BR>2 - THE TRAIN JOB: good episode, but not the best. the action was good though. 3 and a half stars.<BR>3 - BUSHWHACKED: another great episode. 4 stars.<BR>4 - SHINDIG: hilarious and memorable, this was when we finally saw the chemistry between inara and mal really heat up. 4 stars.<BR>5 - SAFE: a creepy & haunting episode. reminded me of the crucible. 4 stars.<BR>6 - OUR MRS. REYNOLDS: one of the most memorable characters in the series is introduced in this episode, saffron. 5 stars.<BR>7 - JAYNESTOWN: hilarious episode that saw jayne being looked at as a god. wonderful. 4 stars.<BR>8 - OUT OF GAS: one of the most sharply written episodes. weaving in and out of time, this episode focuses on how mal picked out his crew. 5 stars.<BR>9 - ARIEL: tense and action-filled episode. 4 stars.<BR>10 - WAR STORIES: another action-filled episode. good, but not the best, but still good. 3.5 stars.<BR>11 - TRASH: saffron returns!!! yet another amazing episode. 5 stars.<BR>12 - THE MESSAGE: the plot sounds mediocre, but it turned out to be good. 4 stars.<BR>13 - HEART OF GOLD: melinda clarke gave a superb guest-starring turn as the mistress of a brothel. this episode affirmed inara's feelings for mal as well. 4.5 stars.<BR>14 - OBJECTS IN SPACE: a perfect whedon episode (written and directed by) that saw the crew of serenity contend with a mysterious bounty hunter. 5 stars.<P>the bonus features are not subtitled or captioned, but they are good. there are only 2 deleted scenes, but the gag reel and the behind the scenes featurettes and alan tudyk's audition, as well as joss singing the theme (one of the best) make up for it.<P>BUY THIS DVD!!!!!! AND GO TO THE MOVIE TOO. :) you won't be sorry!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Yes, it is better than Pulp Fiction and Clerks, much better. I would even go as far to say this is one of the best movies ever to be put to the big screen. It is the type of movie that you have to see again and again, and will still catch something new, even the 50th time you see it. It draws you in and catches your attention early by its strangeness, and dark comedy. Then boom! A six foot tall bunny rabbit tells the main character Donie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) when the world will end. Fom there in it is a roller coster ride all the way through. I also recommend that anyone who sees this movie reads the pamphlet on the DVD called The Philosophy of Time Travel (it is hard to read but fourtunatly it has been put on the internet.) This helps to explain the REAL plot of the movie that you will not get until you read it, but only see it AFTER you see the movie. I also suggest going through the maze that is DonieDarko.com it's confusing (I had to cheat to get through it) but also helps you understand the movie beter.<BR>The prefomances in the movie are great. Jake Gyllenhaal proves himself to be a great actor. The supporting cast to a great job as well. This is one of the best movies of all time and you should not pass this up.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|The quality of this dvd is fine, I might be an ignorant but I am sorry I hated this movie.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is, in my opinion, The Beatles best work ever. I say in my opinion becasue when it comes to The Beatles it is hard for fans to agree on what their best work was. That is fine becasue a case could be made for any one of their albums. Many people complain that Let It Be was an anti-clamatic way for The Beatles to go out, but it wasn't. Becasue that was not their last album that was recoreded, this was. Although this was released before Let It Be this is the clamatic ending that everyone was expectingf. I believe this album is their best for any reasons. Even with them fighting, and basically hating each other after the Get Back movie sessions, they were still able to put together yet another masterpiece. Even the unfinished songs that were thrown in on side two (on vinal) make for an amazing finish. Side one is full of great somgs which include Goerge's second best song, Something (While My Guitar Gently Wheeps is his best dispite what people say about Something) which once again proved that Goerge should have been aloud to write more songs. Come Together is the most memerable song, and is one of John's best. Maxwell's Silver Hammer makes even a song about a cerial killer seem happy. Plus many more. I highly suggest buying this album.
B00006879E|5.0|You know how you hear a song on the radio, love it, buy the album, and turns out the song you heard on the radio was the only one worth listening too? Well, this is NOT the case with Songs About Jane.  I've listened to the entire album, front to back, at least a dozen times and I just got the CD a few days ago.  I love it!  So much so, that I just purchased tickets to their upcoming show at the Shoreline Ampitheatre in San Francisco.

B00009V7RF|5.0|I bought the album for their song, &quot;Where is the love?&quot; I heard the song on DMX and had to get the album.  Not only was that song amazing; but practically every song on the album could be a hit.  Definetely worth every penny.  It's a feel could album that makes you feel like a bad ass every time you sing along to it.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This movie is the story of five criminals and what happened to them after a &quot;ramdom&quot; police lineup. It is one of the best movies of all time and has the most shocking ending I have ever seen. See this movie and you will never regret it.
1400031354|4.0|Mma Ramotswe is at it again!  The No. 1 Ladies Dectective Agency has taken on some new and interesting cases.  In this story  things are not as clear cut as they seem and Precious Ramotswe ponders the morality of telling the truth, telling lies and in general the imperfection of the human condition.  Her insights into the psyche of human nature are all to true.  Alexander McCall Smith has again created a wonderful vignette of stories that delight the reader with their simple storyline, yet complex implications into the nature of women, men and children.  In this series we get to know several characters more intimately including, Precious Ramotse's fiance Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni.  He is a wonderfully rich character that adds much to the story and I am looking forward to reading future installments that include the evolvement of their relationship.  I am constantly enthralled by McCall Smith's description of the African continent and it's people and find these descriptions both heart warming and heart breaking.  It seems there are many changes ahead for Mma Ramotswe; a new family an assisant dectective and a new husband.  I look forward to the continuation of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and the unique insights that Precious Ramotswe has for the readers.
B000002J03|5.0|Who ever has used the term &quot;Led-poison&quot; to describe Led Zeppelin deserves to be beaten to a pulp. Where do you people get off saying the band that laid down the foundation for modern day meatle is a poison to music? Zep is a great band and is in the ranks of bands like Floyd and The Beatles. This is a great album from start to finish and is yet more evidence that classic rock is the best music ever. Ramble On is the second best Zep song next to Sairway to Heaven. Heartbreaker is a song where Page shows off his exellent Guitar playing skill (his solo in Heartbreaker off How the West was Won is unbelivable.) Overall this is an exelent album that I suggest anyone buys, esspecially if they like bands like Metalica, Guns n Roses, or Sound Garden.
B0001XAODY|5.0|I picked this disc up to complement my box set of Spider man.  I think that the color matches more what I saw in the theatre. I would suggest that you pick up this version fo the DVD because you may not have the capability to benefit from everything that it has at the moment. but by the time a few years pass and you spring for a new tv that is 16x9 enhanced it will make a good film even better. The improvements are easy to see on an normal tv but get a good system goig and this disc shines!
B000003TA4|4.0|This album contains the last good music ever to be seen on MTV (unless of course they played something off of In Utero.)  Smells Like Teen Spiret is a classic. I still laugh when i hear In Bloom becasue it makes fun of kids who just listen to music becasue it is popular, the same kids who would be reciting the lyics of In Bloom without knowing what the hell they meant. The cd is a gem that I suggest you buy. I gave it only 4 stars becasue I am comparing it to other cds that, although this is a great cd, it just is not in leage with others (Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, Abby Raod, just about anything by AC/DC, to name a few.) If you ask me, when Kurt died, any chance for good music to be played on MTV or Z100 died with him. May he rest in peace.
B000089CJI|5.0|I a NOT emo. But my god does this stick in my head. Like some crazed hypnotic suggestion, this album keeps calling me to play it over and over again!<BR>I was raised on hip hop and r'n'b and have only recently been exploring other mediums.<BR>Even though I should'nt like it...I do. The inescapable beauty of the lyrics are something to be marveled at. Lines such as &quot;the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they're perfectly alligned&quot; on Such Great Heights are some of the best my eyes have heard.<BR>Listening to this album is an experience. Its an emotion best felt instead of read in words.<BR>This quite simply is art. As said by an ex hardcore hip hop head
B0001NBMBC|5.0|hey everyone, now, i've only heard samples from this cd, but i'd write this review on any slipknot cd. I'll make it short, for anyone who thinks they want heavy music, slipknot is not where you find that, no slipknot heavy riff or blastbeat will ever reach anywhere near even the most mediocre death metal. And for those that want nu-metal you should listen to the radio. And for those that want melody you should listen to at the gates or in flames or something. Slipknot does nothing that hasnt been done better before or currently. They are not covering new ground, so ignore what people say about originality, lets just say, if you mixed coke and pepsi you wouldnt have a new name for it, it would just be coke and pepsi, slipknots just good music and bad music, so find which one of those two you want to listen to and track down the classic bands. Classic good=maybe, Deicide? Classic bad=Korn? Honestly if you want intimidating music for gods sake just track down the new vital remains cd or the two disc Exhumed history cd. Brodequin or something, slipknot is a watered down product of good influences.
0441172717|5.0|The Dune Trilogy, written by award winning author Frank Herbert, is a spellbounding trilogy that captures the hearts of billions.  At first glance, Dune seems no more than another tale of fueds and conspiracies, but after reading the book through, it is a complex, deep story that will keep you from putting the book down.  The Dune Chronicals is by far one of the most compelling pieces of writting in modern literature and is science-fiction's answer J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings'.  Dune is a grand story and should never be without the rest of the Dune Trilogy that ties it's concept together.  I myself am looking forward to the conclusion of the Dune Chronicals in Brian Herbert's 'Hunters of Dune' and 'Sandworms of Dune'.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This Turandot is nothing short of fabulous. Even though I generally dislike Pavarotti, he is wonderful here--perhaps because this isn't a later recording of his. And I can't think of a single way in which Caballe's Liu could be any better. Sutherland's voice is surprisingly dramatic, also. It makes you wonder if she would have been better suited training in the dramatic fach than the coloratura (though one listening of her &quot;Caro nome&quot; will suggest otherwise). The sound is vibrant, and there isn't a problem with any one of the singers. If you like Turandot, perhaps Puccini's grandest opera, snag a copy of this recording. And though not exactly written by Puccini, Turandot's ending is my favorite of any opera.
B00005JMCT|3.0|I am a HUGE fan of the first 2 pie films. My high school life was nowhere near as fun and exciting as this so I was intrigued from the start. The films had interesting and fun characters and it was easy to want to see more.<br />I missed the 3rd film &quot;American Wedding&quot; when it was in the theatre. I wasn't pleased that a majority of the cast was absent from this outing, so I just didn't bother.<br />I just picked up the DVD, and watched it last night. I was to say it was better than I thought it would be, but still just average.<br />What's sad is the premise had so much promise and with all that was built up about the bachelor party scene, I thought I was in for a rare treat.<br />Jason Biggs &amp; Alyson Hannigan are still both excellent in their roles. There was a level of sweetness that really isn't seen in the first 2. Eugene Levy has an expanded role in this 3rd film. He is so welcomed. I have enjoyed his character and never think he's &quot;too much&quot;. It's nice to see this guy get some comedic respect after all these years.<br />The biggest problem I have is with the &quot;Stifler&quot; character. In the beginning of this movie... his foul-mouthed antics are so over the top that it's annoying. It appears as if he didn't want to do the movie so decided to do a parody of Stifler. His character is just as unwanted onscreen as it is by the viewing audience. <br />The other BIG letdown is the \\"Bachelor Party scene\\". Don't get me wrong; I like naked women just as much as the next guy, but this was lame; especially when much of the hype was about this scene. Sure the girls are smoking hot (most notably Nikki Schieler as the cop). But the scene falls desperately flat soon after. To the point where the gags are no longer funny but just sad. What should have happened is the Bachelor Party should have been the focus of the film, much like the first 2 where a major party was the focus. That would have been a nice way to draw in the other cast members to come back.<br />After seeing the movie, it's easy to see why most of the cast did not comeback. The only question I have is, while Shannon Elizabeth will no longer do nudity and Mena Suvari is married to a very successful cinematographer, what is Chris Klein so busy doing that he can't come back as Oz? He's gone nowhere since the first 2 films.<br />There are some great \\"toilet humor\\" gags in the film. I am a big fan of toilet humor and just watching Jim land into awkward situations is funny. Also seeing someone eat poop, while gross, is still pretty funny.<br />All in all this was just an average film, a decent ending to an otherwise great franchise. I think it could have been much better if the creators paid more to substance than to cashing in on the name.<br />If you are looking for a really funny college movie, I say get your hands on Van Wilder, that's a film that won't let you down.<br />-Mark
B000148KK2|4.0|Jeesh, what is all the negativity about?  i picked up a copy of diana's new cd at costco thinking it would make yummy post-wedding background music.  a few songs were so sad and lamenting, i had to listen to them again.  then when i thought of elvis costello's  idiosyncratic style of songwriting, i listened to her songs in a different way.  IF YOU CAN APPRECIATE ELVIS COSTELLO'S MUSIC THEN YOU CAN LOVE THIS ALBUM, AS WELL.  my favorite song is 'Departure Bay' and 'Abandoned Masquarade'.  Please DON'T honor the negative press until you just sit back and take it all in.  it is so beautiful.
B00005QENZ|5.0|Aerosmith's Get A Grip is a great album for any occasion.  Every time I put this album on, it brings back such good memories, especially since I was so young and things were a lot easier then.  Aerosmith's early 90s music is probably my favourite era of Aerosmith and this is probably my favourite CD.<BR>Steven Tyler's vocals are exceptional and the song writing is exciting.  Best tracks - Eat The Rich, Shut Up &amp; Dance, Line Up and Amazing.  Perfect for any music or Aerosmith collection.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This is in response to Rourke's comment that garage rock has finally crossed the pond. Sorry to inform you, it crossed the pond almost fifty years ago, when it came to the United States. Ever heard of the Rolling Stones? Thought so.
B00005N5S5|5.0|OK, I had my suspicions after seeing Conan The Barbarian, but this movie proves it beyond any shadow of doubt. Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a cyborg! I watched him come through time and space, hunting down that poor Connor girl (Linda Hamilton) in 1984 LA, and I just knew! His relentless pursuit of Sarah Connor is devoid of any / all emotion! Watching him is like watching any well-oiled machine. His robotic moves are matched only by his mechanical dialogue. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) comes through the same time portal, in an attempt to stop the rampaging mechanoid, but can flesh and blood possibly stand against such a machine as Arny?? No! Run Reese! Run Sarah! Our very future depends on your survival! THE TERMINATOR substantiates my deepest fears! We are doomed! The infamous &quot;police station slaughter scene&quot; shows us Mr. Schwarzenegger as the juggernaut he is! Unstoppable, concerned with nothing but the termination of mankind! He is now governor of California! Soon, SkyNet will be established and Arnold will become our king! EEK! James Cameron's intense masterwork of sci-fi / horror is perfect for Arnold's plan of world domination! Watch it and believe...
B00005JMJ4|1.0|In Short: It does not measure up to all the hoopla.<br />If you have seen the movie and were not impressed by it, do not feel bad. There's nothing wrong with you. A lot of people around you, suffering from Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome (see the review by gregy55902), will try to make you feel stupid. You are not. You were able to see the movie for what it is: not much. If you have not seen the movie, try to see if you can find a copy in a library, like I did. The less you spend, the better you will feel.<br />A lot of reviews claim that those of us who didn't like it, essentially didn't get it. For those who 'got it', it was several things: real, with unique plot, idea that is like poetry, introspective genius and what not. The reality is that the movie is pretty unreal and shoddy. What has worked: cinematography, music, Bill Murray's acting. What hasn't worked: the rest.<br />A lot of priases of Sophia Coppola have been sung. Unfortunately, the film fails miserably in the departments she was responsible for. The two main characters are supposed to be in Tokyo just for a week. Those who have traveled to any big city in the world know that despite language problems it's hard to feel 'trapped' if you are there only for a week. If the claim is that they are feeling trapped in their current lives, then much more would have happened between them. It didn't.<br />About Charlotte being 'lost'. Looks like Yale's admission standards have really fallen. Their philosophy graduate is listening to popular &quot;You are ok. I'm ok&quot; type audio tape for resolving her existential doubts, does not read a single book, looks perpetually bored, instead of being excited, in a place full of culture that she has never visited before. There is no deep meaning to the the shallow development of Charlotte's character. Is it a reflection of Coppola's own life that lacks real experiences? Those close to her can answer that better. Charlotte's &quot;walks&quot; around the city with the 'lost' expression of her face seemed like a naive way of trying to link the title of the film to its content. The 'friends' of Charlotte that they spend the kareoke night with were relatively underdeveloped. And what was the point of nudie bar? All cities have them. They didn't spend much time in there anyway, so how did it help the story. The local culture has been captured only in the form of stereotypes.<br />The reason all the favorable reviews are asking you to go beyond this and that in order to appreciate the movie is because the lack of substance and obvious flaws in the movie. Claiming that less favorable reviews are necessarily from the people who are otherwise interested in car chases, slap-stick comedies or run-of-the-mill romances is patronizing and ignorant. The real take-home message is that this movie has been grossly overrated.<br />Some of the professional reviewers might have had vested interests in promoting Coppola's daughter. But the movie-goers don't owe anyone anything. There are good,well-rounded AND intriguing movies out there; this ain't one of them. But if you are looking for a movie that you want to call cool because everyone else does, this is the one for you.<br />In &quot; A conversation with director Sofia Coppola and actor Bill Murray&quot;, there is no conversation with Coppola. The whole interview looks like &quot;bring your kid to work&quot; day for Bill Murray. Coppola has no insights to share... probably because she had none. She couldn't even think of a line for Bill Murray when he whispers in Scarlet's ear at the end of the movie. Remember &quot;Virgin Suicides&quot;? This woman can't write/finish a script to save her life. Has a *LOT* to learn from her father, rather hasn't learn *anything* for her father, yet.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Most Americans like to pretend that there is a God. The God that most Americans like to pretend exists is Jesus. This movie was made for emotionally troubled people. This movie with its extreme violence and fantasy of Jesus will help cover-up their emotional problems.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I had the privilege of seeing &quot;Wicked&quot; up close and personal on Broadway this summer, and right away came home and purchased the CD.  I was not disappointed.  Idina Menzel's vocals are SOO incredible and powerful, the only thing better is hearing her in person from the front row.  Kristen Chenowith has such an unusual quality in her voice... usually pleasing, definitely distinctive.  I have to disagree with the &quot;professional&quot; reviewer who stated these two ladies needed better material.  The songs will stick with you.  I listened to the CD twice and I can't get &quot;Loathing&quot; out of my head!  The best song, however, is &quot;Defying Gravity.&quot;  I still cry when I hear it.  If your first introduction to this musical was at the Tony awards, don't think for a second the music you heard over the TV captured even partially the beauty of the song.  The CD, fortunately, does.<br />I strongly recommend this amazing CD.  It is VERY well done and you will enjoy it immensely.
B000068PQ0|4.0|I first heard the Flaming Lips at Coachella. Wayne Coyne ran around in a plastic bubble to crowd surf and it was awesome. This album is sort of like Wayne Coyne said before he played &quot;Yoshimi...&quot; :don't take this too seriously it's just for fun. And that basically is the album. If you don't know who they are you might've heard &quot;Do you realize?&quot; from that commercial, where &quot;Do you realize, that you have the most, beautiful face&quot; echos over soft chords. And I love &quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Pt. 1.&quot; It's a cd to treasure, and try to see them live! Very energetic, fun performances that never take themselves too seriously.

0446530891|3.0|This is a convoluted tangle that doesn't do Baldacci justice. It has too many parts that just don't hold up. Read Saving Faith and Absolute Power instead!
0156027321|5.0|I resisted this book for ages, even though it won the Booker Prize and got raves from book reviewers. It's about a guy trapped on a raft with a tiger, for Pete's sake, how exciting is that? <br />Actually, it is superexciting. This is one of the best books I've read in ages. It has enough science (Pi Patel, the main character, is a zookeeper) to tickle your brain, enough earnest faith to buoy your spirit and enough post-colonial literary sentiment to flatter your literature-lovin' ego - without the obnoxiousness those three qualities might bring to a book by a less skillful writer.<br />I cannot stress enough - although &quot;Pi&quot; is a deeply thoughtful read, an intellectual read,  it is absolutely a freakin' page-turner.
B0000029DD|5.0|This is the version that closed an episode of  &quot;West Wing&quot;,(it may have been the season finale), a couple of years ago. It was not a happy ending; the heartfelt vocals fit the mood  and deepened it. I had  no idea who it was, (I thought it might be  Tuck and Patty bacause the vocals are so natural and soulful in their high pitch, and the tremelo guitar so nicely supportive, but T&amp;P had no commercially available recording of it), and eventually found it after checking every version available,(I don't regret owning so many performances of this wonderful song). The legend could be built on this one track alone. (I still think Tuck and Patty should record it.)
B000093BDX|5.0|It's possible to get through life with only two Beach Boys albums, but you've got to pick the one that isn't Pet Sounds pretty carefully. This is a perfect choice. Following the popular fill-the-disc format of recent greatest hits albums, it packs 30 tracks together on a single CD. What's impressive about this is that there's very little dropoff in quality between the very best songs in the collection and the few that might be less recognizable to a Beach Boys neophyte, like &quot;Wild Honey,&quot; &quot;Darlin',&quot; and &quot;Good Timin'.&quot; All the big hits are here, and they sound great thanks to good sequencing and a few new stereo mixes. You can't go wrong with this album.
0375703861|5.0|I loved this book. How to describe it?<br />Imaginative. That's a good start. This book is imaginative. How on earth did she come up with this storyline? And this is her first novel?!?<br />The characters in this story compose an ensemble cast. The background Smith gives to illustrate each of them made me care about each and every one of them, though some were far more likeable than others. We begin focusing on one man and his struggles, then the tale expands to encompass his family, his best friend, his best friend's family. As members of younger generations pick up the thread of the story, the reader's gaze is drawn to them....<br />There is so much going on in this story that the climax that attempts to tie it all together is almost a stretch--or maybe I wasn't fond of the way the book ended because I just didn't want it to end.
B000065VA1|5.0|There's always one pivotal record that truly makes an artist unique.  One for which they'll always be remembered, even after a string of later achievements.  Fleetwood Mac did it in 1977 with Rumours.  U2 made history and the cover of Time Magazine with The Joshua Tree.  And Peter Gabriel's 1986 release So firmly established him as an artist in his own right.  In previous years, fans still linked Gabriel's musical identity to the Genesis days, and solo hits like \\"Shock The Monkey\\" couldn't quite bring him to the forefront.  But So changed all that, capturing the attention of critics and listeners alike.  Recognized as Gabriel's first commercial success, the record sold over 3 million copies in the US alone, and soared to #2 on both the US and UK charts.  So went on to receive Grammy nominations for Album of the Year, as well as Song of the Year for &quot;Sledgehammer.&quot;  Probably the best-known of all Peter Gabriel's songs, &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; won the prestigious Video Vanguard Award, and Rolling Stone magazine ranked it among \\"The Top 100 Videos.\\"  Today, So remains Peter Gabriel's most original work, delivering an extraordinary blend of songwriting, vocals, and musical intuition.  From slamming tracks like &quot;Red Rain,&quot; &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and &quot;Big Time,&quot; to darker-hued corners of the soul with \\"In Your Eyes\\" and \\"Mercy Street,\\" the record is pure genius.  One could argue the depth and color in these songs betray the simple monochrome image of Gabriel on the cover.  Of course, Peter Gabriel redefined himself in 1992 with the release of Us, followed by the highly-acclaimed Secret World Tour.  Even then, his live performance of &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; still held audiences awestruck, proving Gabriel will never outlive the essential timelessness of So.  Country superstar Garth Brooks once remarked in 1994 that every musician searches for that one anthem, their career song, which ultimately defines them as an artist.  Peter Gabriel certainly uncovered not one, but several career hits in So.  When an artist's music refuses to be confined to one decade, when songs manage to stay relevant long past their prime, then what you have is not an artist, but a legend.
0679428895|4.0|Just finished Pompeii, which didn't come alive for me until the last half of the story. The characterizations are a bit shallow, with the exception of Pliny Elder, who is brought to life as a living person rather than the historical icon he'd always been to me. Some of the excesses of Roman society are set forth in a truly revolting fashion! What this book does so well is place the reader on the Bay of Naples, from the initial portents of the volcanic eruption, through the inferno with its deadly hail of rocks, to its completion and the smothering of the cities and their inhabitants. Makes it all real. The only other description of doom and destruction that I've seen done so well is the harrowing artillery bombardment presented by Michael Shaara in \\"The Killer Angels\\".
B0000296SI|2.0|This is a great cd dont get me wrong but the clean version is horrible. Almost every song your editing words out and it sounds stupid. Do me a favor, if you like the music get the real version!!!
0446608955|5.0|I LOVE this book! I admit I only read it after seeing the movie, but i am sooo glad i did! it is the BEST book I have ever read! I am only 15 years old and have read it at least 30 times since i was 13. I have actually read most of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one really stood out and touched me. I sit there and SOB for literally 30 minutes after i finish reading it. Jamie and Landon are both believable characters which made me fall in love with this book. This novel proves how fate has a way of working out. Landon was always mean to Jamie, but they ended up together. I suggest a big box of tissues when reading this because of all of his books, it is the saddest because Jamie is such a sweet character and was a good person. I just hope other people will read this and realize how absolutely wonderful this book is. I never thought i'd smile and cry so much from a book! You will LOVE &quot;A walk to remember&quot; so read it, you won't regret it! And if you're too lazy, rent the movie, which isn't quite the same or as sad, but still the point of the story gets out there. It's good for people my age to realize how lucky they have it and how not to judge other people because you never know what they could be dealing with at home or in their personal life. READ THIS BOOK!! ;) I'd give it 100 stars, but this only goes up to 5!
B000068QY7|5.0|There's no reason to hate oasis, it's just that people got so sick of hearing wonderwall, that they forced themselves to hate them. Now anything new that comes out is overshadowed in the one hit wonder crap that gets their 2 months of airplay and then fades. At least that's the case in the states. In England, hell, the country can't get enough of this band. Maybe I should move there b/c I love the band.<br />Heathen Chemistry, although not yet a classic as What's the Story and not (in my opinion) as structured as Standing on the Shoulders of Giants, it still fits in nicely as the latest effort pulled out by the guys. What's to notice about this album is that only Noel and Liam are the only remaining members of the original band. Then again, they are the backbone of the band. It is obvious to any fan that the sound is much different than the first 3 albums though. It can be a good thing in some songs such as the &quot;Hindu Times&quot; which rolls through w/ much energy, and &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; which was somewhat of a recent hit and also in the movie &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; at the end. Another UK single, &quot;Songbird&quot; which rather short, was written by Liam. It should have been longer b/c it's a great song and very catchy.<br />Noel sings lead on &quot;Force of Nature&quot;, &quot;Little By Little&quot;, and &quot;She is Love.&quot; Usually the songs he sings end up as B-sides, but can't forget his most famous &quot;Don't Look Back in Anger&quot; plus he did a nice job w/ &quot;Where Did it All Go Wrong.&quot; Personally, &quot;She is Love&quot; should definately been scratched on this album. It doesn't really fit in w/ the sound of any other songs. Would have been a nice B-side that Oasis masters more than any other band of all time. &quot;Force of Nature&quot; is cool which shows some sarcasm in it. The last UK single, &quot;Little By Little,&quot; is a great song w/ a nice chorus and good guitar solo. The video for LBL is sweet as well.<br />&quot;Hung in a Bad Place&quot; is somewhat of a filler, but still a great oasis song that ranks w/ any non-single they have. &quot;A Quick Peep&quot; is like the new version of the &quot;Swamp Song&quot; but just only over a minute. I'm sure they extended it somewhere down the line. &quot;(Probably) All in the Mind&quot; is a Beatlesque type song w/ a nice ring to it. Liam writes and sings &quot;Born On a Different Cloud&quot; This is his best song to date. &quot;Better Man&quot; also provides the album w/ a crisp new sounding oasis. The only thing that sucks is that they put a 30 minute gap until the hidden song. There's no lyrics and mostly just jumbled guitar play, w/ a nice drum beat and later on some kind of woodwind, maybe a flute. Anyway if you forgot to push stop, you'll eventually get to it.<br />You can bash oasis as much as you want for not putting out any u.s. singles since &quot;Don't Look Back in Anger&quot; but you shouldn't hate the music if you are an oasis fan. They are pretty much a whole new band, and actually for the better. Heathen Chemistry may not be the best oasis album, but it still is a great oasis album.
0451169514|5.0|This is a great book, highly recommended. I'm sure other reviews will tell you all about it. But, just so you know, there is a section that explicitly describes several 12 yr olds taking turns having sex with another 12 yr old prepubescent girl. There are actually many gross parts that aren't needed, like a little boy giving his friend (who's also a boy) sexual pleasure... Stephen King is a pretty sick individual. Not for the kiddies (whom incidentally make up about 75% of his fanbase)
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Although I can't stand a lot of nu-metal like Linkin Park and Trapt, I love classic nu-metal like Slipknot and Korn. So it makes sense that I love this album, and have listened to it many, many, many times. These guys have a lot more talent than many other bands out there today, and that's saying something. The new masks are downright creepy. Especially the singer's. But that's not the point. The point is, this CD is awesome. Songs like &quot;The Blister Exists&quot; and &quot;Duality&quot; are heavy hitters. Fresh guitar riffs, crazy drums, and some actual singing sometimes, instead of screaming, but screaming is cool too. Then songs like &quot;Circle&quot; and &quot;Vermillion pt.2&quot; are suprisingly calm, a nice addition. There are some truly amazing and memorable parts, like the part in &quot;Welcome&quot; between 1:56 and 2:15 truly insane guitar right there. Then there are truely creepy songs like &quot;Vermillion&quot; and &quot;The Virus of Life&quot; that make your skin crawl the first time you hear them. Overall, an amazing CD, so buy it now. &quot;She isn't, real can't make her real...&quot;
B0001NBMBC|3.0|come on!!!-every one saying this is slipknots best album must be on drugs!!-no way does it even come close to the sheer brutality and brilliance of iowa and as for the accoustic tracks-well one would have been bearable but 4????-hope they bring back ross robinson 2 produce the next album-rick rubin has all but taken away the sound that made this band so special in the 1st place
0684803356|5.0|EXCERPTED FROM &quot;GOD'S COUNTRY&quot; BY STEVEN TRAVERS<br />&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is based upon Hemingway?s support for the anti-Communists fighting in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s. He and many other Americans went over to fight in the war, which some say was a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for World War II. It did not materialize into the kind of idealized Spanish government that many had sacrificed for. The fascistic Francisco Franco ended up ruling an isolationist Spain until the 1970s. While the nation is now Democratic, the Franco regime was the final event that took Spain from greatness to mediocrity. Hemingway also wrote a stageplay about the Spanish Civil War called &quot;The Fifth Column&quot;.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<B>...
0345451325|4.0|I am a big fan of Halo, but I never really cared for reading the books! Then, this summer, I got really bored and I had nothing to do, so I ordered the Books via Amazon, and I was SOOOO happy with how it turned out! You learn everything and much more about the Spartans and Master Chief.<br />The most interesting parts of the book are the first and last! In the first part you learn a lot about how the spartan IIs came to be, and in the last you learn how they die!<br />Also, more information the game could not offer is shown! Such as, how human regenerating shields came about! Or how Captain Keyes became a Captain!<br />Listen, if you liked playing the game, you'll love the book! The battles are awsome and the ideas in the book are cool too! Enjoy!
B00005LC1H|3.0|Love this series which is, IMHO, the funniest sitcom series ever shown on either side of The Pond.  There's no disappointment in re-watching all the wonderful episodes.<br />There is, however, beaucoup de frustration with the way in which the links were designed. You have sit right in front of the TV, no more than 4' away to read the postage-sized stamps which indicate episodes, commentary, etc.  (I still can't read them.)<br />Still, once you get going, it's hours of laughter, great performances, and great writing.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor shine as Edward Bloom, who repeats his preposterous stories thousand times before his son Will -- stories about a giant living in a cave, a witch whose eyeball reflects how the watcher dies, and of course, the big fish.  Now old Edward does it again, before Will's wedding guests and Will himself, who begins to find his daddy too annoying these days.     <br />But the day comes when Will realizes that Edward is not all lying -- actually, the stories he told were all based on truth.  On the deathbed of Edward, he recounts the days of his youth, the romance with his wife, and a little secret about the town of &quot;Spectre.&quot;  <br />The strength of &quot;Big Fish&quot; is its visual flair, and the director is Tim Burton.  The picture is filled with his imagination, which is greatly helped by the able cast including, besides McGregor and Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Alison Lohman as Edward's love Sandra, and Danny Devito.  Jessica Lange plays older Sandra while Will by Billy Crudup.<br />Again I say the visual is great because the stories Edward tells us tend to be repetitive, and its contents are not always interesting, or 'big' enough.  Some episodes are not necessary while some look mercilessly shortened, especially the one about the girl 'Jenny' who is incredibly cute.  Burton keeps on his tales, and they mostly work, but he needs more careful selection and less running time to produce the same effect.<br />Still, the film is moving when it concentrate on its theme -- the relations between the characters, the father and the son in particular.  I don't buy the idea of casting McGregor as Edward from Alabama, but as his resembrance with Finney would justify it.  Well, but Burton's best remains the one about another Edward, which is of course, &quot;Edward Scissorhands.&quot;
B000021YQV|5.0|The First Review of this album I read critisized it for being another Nu-Metal band whining about life. What on earth are you talking about? Maybe it has Nu-Metal riffs, but the lyrics in songs like Prison Song, Chop Suey, Science, and Psycho are fiercly political...not whining at all. Unless you are a ultra-conservative maniac who considers people conserned about teh state of the world under the riegn of Dubya...Another person complaines that science (the song) is bad is because it says that science is bad and faith is good. Idiot! Do you not see that they are making fun of religious fundamentalists and other organized religious groups? Another complains that this is dumb corporate rock that is bland nu-metal. This is incredible creative and new. And there is no ugly rapping like Rage Against the Machine- yes, it sucked- so there- and I like soundgarden too...<br />Anyway, it seems to me that it isnt System of A Down that is complaining...it's all these whiny amazon.com reviewers....<br />Anyways, the review. This is a fabulous creative funky fun energetic political masterpiece. Blender (a review magazine) wrote it as one of the best 500 albums made ever. <br />The Prison Song: 10/10 The riffs are kinda ugly, but i love the lyrics...<BR>Needles: 8/10 NOt my favorite...I usually skip this one. <BR>Deer Dance: 10/10 Yah! Great Song.Political lyrics, fun guitar riffs...one of the best..<BR>X: 8/10 Interesting...very short..I kinda thought this was dumb. This and bounce are the only filler on this album.<BR>CHop Suey:10/10 Incredible, song and well, it can be beuatiful one second..and then one or two seconds later loud and screaming...one of the best<BR>Bounce:7/10 Pure Filler....I like the chorus... &quot;she had so many friends&quot; the lyrics are nonsensical...at first I thought he was saying bounce f*cker f*ucker f*cker...don't worry he's just saying Pogo.<BR>Forest: 10/10 Good song I like it be the earlier stuff it more interesting to listen to.<BR>AtwA: 8/10 Notreally political..the only song where the singer is whining<BR>Science: 10/10 Very amusing...it mocking those who believe this you fools...<BR>Shimmy: 10/10 great song..the intro is really fast, but it's really short<BR>Toxicity: 8/10 political.

6300214028|4.0|EXCERPTED FROM STEVEN TRAVERS' &quot;GOD'S COUNTRY&quot;<br />The 1920s were a strange time. John Reed?s &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot; reached a large audience in the United States and internationally. Many wanted to know why an entire planet could be thrust into war. In an attempt to address that issue, some decided that nationalism, governmental agendas, realpolitik, racism, class warfare, capitalism, Democracy, and corporations in bed with politicians and militarists were to blame. <br />Nationalism was part of it. German unification and Balkan nationalism played a role. Governmental agendas and realpolitik always have played a role in conflict. Since Communism addressed the concept of &quot;one world government&quot; and a &quot;world without borders,&quot; some concluded that Communism offered the answer to these problems.<BR>Racism was never an original part of the war, but would emerge as an ugly by-product. The Turks unleashed an open can of worms resulting in &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and genocide pitting Christians against Muslims, Turks against Arabs, secular vs. religious. In Germany, an easy scapegoat began to emerge: The Jews. Lies began to spread that Jewish banking interests profited from the war. In the American South Jewish influence was an affront to their sensibilities. The Ku Klux Klan rose again after a period of dormancy. The KKK?s &quot;mandate&quot; pitted them against a &quot;worldwide Jewish conspiracy&quot; somehow in league with Papal domination. They said Catholics pledge allegiance not to the U.S., but to the Vatican. But few Catholics and fewer Jews lived in the South. Many blacks did. They were becoming a more prominent segment of society. Blacks were emerging as professional athletes in the Negro baseball leagues, and as musicians in the jazz world. As they asserted themselves, this infuriated the white underclass.<BR>But the most pernicious thing that emerged out of World War I were Westerners who believed that the war had occurred because of the failure of capitalism, Democracy, and corporations who were in bed with politicians and militarists. When Reed?s book came out, a segment of society allowed themselves to believe that the new political system in Russia should be given a chance. Communism became &quot;the answer&quot; to society?s many problems, including racism and poverty. The failure of Communism, already evident by 1920, was not exposed to the world. Reed either chose not to write about the thousands and thousands of famine victims, the secret police, the crackdowns and forced marches, the banishments, assassinations and disappearances, or he was controlled by the hierarchy, and not allowed to see it. He probably did not want to see it. He had found his story and he was going to stick to it. The great failure of the free press, of governments and political figures, of humanists and truth-seekers, was the failure to pin Russia - Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and the rest of them - down before they became too powerful. To expose them for what they were.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>...
B000002I25|5.0|The year's 1967. Music is being processed within an inch of life and musicians are coming out onto the scene. Gotta admit it though- none like Jim, John, Ray and Robby. &quot;The Doors&quot; is an essential for anybody who's looking for a first or second Doors album to purchase. Although this isn't my favorite Doors album, the songs on here are memoriable ones. &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, obviously one of the most famous Doors song, for one thing gives you 7 minutes of enjoyment and vocals that'd make even the dullest person want to dance. &quot;Break On Through&quot;, another Doors favorite, is a song everyone has grown familiar with. &quot;Backdoor Man&quot;, &quot;End Of The Night&quot;, &quot;End&quot; and &quot;I Looked at You&quot; are among my favorites on the album.<br />So ditch modern music and stick with artists like The Doors, and go out and by this CD. It'll be one you'll love to have in your CD collection! If you're looking for another Doors album to experience, try &quot;L.A Woman&quot; or &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot;.
B00013F38K|5.0|For under $30, I'm not going to worry too much about a cropping here and an edit there. There is way more going on in this series than the fighting; to me, that was the hook to watch. Being a Christian, I never felt like I was being proselatized sp? to become a buddist; in fact, I think the demeanor and grace of Caine was very much more toward the my idea of the gentle, humble Christ, of the Bible. That is, until the kicks start flying. Caine always humbled himself, very lowly to deflect and side-step conflict. Great life lessons, indeed. Therin, is where I find the value of this series.
0792843584|2.0|&quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; is one of the most beautifully photographed films ever made. Every frame seems almost antique, a dazzling combination of sunlit exteriors and naturally lit interiors with candles and oil lamps that give the film a burnish unlike any other. <br />And there's several brillantly directed sequences that are unlike anything in any other film. A hyper-active rollerskating dance that transforms into a waltz between the romantic leads. A massive graduation dance on the lawn of Harvard (actually shot at Oxford) that is breathtaking in its scope. <br />However, all this camerawork and virtuoso editing is wrapped around one of the dullest screenplays ever written. The story is so simple, it could have been covered in 90 minutes instead of 3 hours and 40 minutes, and most of the movie consists of long pensive silences between the actors that lack any kind of dramatic interest or narrative thrust. The movie meanders, wanders, stops dead in its tracks, only occasionally remembering to pick up the storyline and go somewhere with it. <br />Kristofferson is utterly passive and uninteresting. <br />The film spends its first half-hour setting up a friendship between Kristofferson and John Hurt that has no bearing or meaning to to the storyline.<br />The love triangle aspect is contrived and dull. <br />And the victimized immigrants in the film are so shrill, panicky, and annoying that you almost wish they'd get killed. <br />Pictorially, the film is a masterpiece. But as a narrative film, it utterly fails on every level.....never before has so much care gone into making a film with so little substance. <br />As you can tell, this is a very ambivelent review. I think &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; is worth a viewing just for those lovely images and sequences.....pure eye candy. Just don't expect to be entertained past that level.

0684800713|5.0|EXCERPTED FROM \\"GOD'S COUNTRY\\" BY STEVEN TRAVERS...<br />The \\"lost generation\\" was marked by the work of American writers who journeyed to France to write in the 1920s. They included Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, who once said of Oakland, California, \\"There is no there there.\\"<BR>  Hemingway was a reporter for the Kansas City Star, a man's man of gruff, Midwestern sentiment. He came from a family of some local prominence. Perhaps because he did not face great hardships growing up, he felt the need to test himself. In this regard, Hemingway and Teddy Roosevelt have much in common. Hemingway went looking for his manhood in World War I and found it. The experience formed him. He saw action fighting alongside the Italian allies and sustained wounds. According to his own account, he had a \\"life-after-death\\" episode. While recovering, he fell in love with a pretty American nurse. When the war ended the romance did not take, in part because Hemingway had a stubborn streak of jealousy. But he used these events to launch a career of great works, writing in a tone of melancholy wistfulness, imbued with American patriotism and the manly need to face danger, romance and adventure with courage and idealism, tinged by ironic cynicism.<BR>\\"A Farewell to Arms\\" was his semi-autobiographical account of World War I, including his lost love with the nurse. Hemingway captured the \\"lost generation\\" in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", which detailed American ex-patriates in Europe who were mentally and physically scarred by the Great War. His main character is unable to consummate a relationship with a beautiful woman who pines for him, because he sustained injuries in the war that prevent him from sexual functioning. The woman goes on to a career of carnal conquest with a variety of men, none of whom fulfill her. Amid much drunkenness and debauchery, the book addresses anti-Semitism, a relatively new theme in the 1920s, although Hemingway is not wholly sympathetic to Jews. When the book was made into a film in the 1950s, Daryl F. Zanuck cast a handsome young Jewish man, Robert Evans, as a Spanish bullfighter. When Evans approached \\"Papa\\" Hemingway at Yankee Stadium, the old man rebuffed him. He was furious that one of his beloved characters, a Spaniard, be portrayed by an American Jew.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\"<BR>(...)
B00000J7SS|5.0|A lot of people go \\"I'm a big Miles Davis fan but Bitches Brew sucks.  It's too loud and wandering and the tracks don't go anywhere.\\"  Maybe they have a point.  Disc one is just two songs that are, like, 20 minutes each.  The recording of these two features long repeated sections that were apparently spliced by tape by Teo Macero.  The second disc has songs of a more manageable length, but the discordant jazz rock fusion is still too much for some people, even with songs like \\"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down.\\"<BR>Artistically, he was building up to this for years, ever since the jam-oriented material of the late second quintet, much of it staying unreleased for years.  He was allured by the rock stardom of the likes of Sly and the Family Stone and managed to lure some of the finest musicians anywhere (maybe back then they just had potential, it's hard to tell in this setting) to complete his daring vision.  The fact is that this album (and also In a Silent Way) turned jazz on its ear, maybe for the worse, but its reversal of the conventions of form and its entire rejection of swing not only signaled that Miles Davis was never turning back, but jazz was never turning back.  Miles davis derailed about six years after this, reappearing only to go further in the electronic direction until the early 90s, when Doo Bop found him costarring with subpar rappers.  This album is one of the more fresh and listenable works of Miles' 70s electric period; many other works are even more overburdened with cocaine-addled masturbatory jam-orgies that drag on without semblance of melody or form or sometimes even time.  This is one of the better representatives of a style that was radical in its inception, but which, for Miles at least, failed to go anywhere.
B0001US8EO|3.0|There's a lot to like in Lawrence Kasdan's deconstruction of desperate western heroes in the epic WYATT EARP Two-Disc Special Edition (Warner).<br />This admirable, sometimes pretentious attempt to capture the complex, multi-faceted character of lawman and criminal Wyatt Earp (an uneven Kevin Costner) from Wichita to Dodge to the showdown at Tombstone's O.K. Corral does not always work but it sure looks great. Dennis Quaid is memorable as Earp's lethal pal Doc Holliday.<br />This is the 190 minute version.  The twenty two additional minutes that are in the extended VHS version are presented separately here as &quot;lifted scenes.&quot;

B00004VWAF|3.0|This is one of the most unique works that Miles and his coke junkie entourage produced before Miles declared that jazz was dead and quit for half a decade.  It, instead of featuring songs that begin with a half groove and abandon them for impulsive detours, features what really amounts to two songs that explore the same groove a very long time.  I apologize for those who were expecting four songs because the bassline for the second one reappears in the 3rd and 4th ones, although the track becomes more thickly layered.  There is not to much to say about the content of the recording...Miles davis appears  with a wah wah pedal hooked up to a hole in his mouthpiece, and uses this to very interesting effect...what is really remarkable about this recording is that it does kind of look forward to the complicated looping and overdubbing techniques that dance artists did with better equipment in subsequent decades.  It is really unusual for Miles to piece these tracks together for musicians to play over, because no one was doing things that way at that time.  If you can get past the stylistic monotony and narrow range of this album, you may find it quite interesting and eerily futuristic, a standout of his work of this period.
B0001VTPWM|3.0|The director's cut of Paul Verhoeven's thrillingly original satire Robocop is included in the ROBOCOP TRILOGY (MGM). In Irv Kershner's sequel, the adventures of the cyborg are greatly intensified.  Underrated and much criticized upon its theatrical release, this action-filled, morally-centered follow-up tale takes deadly aim at a society that sanctions the drugs and pop culture crap that's aimed at 12 year olds.<br />The third title in the series no longer stars Peter Weller and is borderline silly with a flying Robocop and none of the fierce satirical force of its predecessors.

B0001ADAVK|3.0|Okay, I suppose any idiot could tell that this was a chick flick based on two things: 1. It's a Julia Roberts vehicle. 2. Everyone else on the cover is female. Those are pretty good clues.  Well, being the fair, forward-thinking male that I am, I didn't let this prevent me from watching \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" when my mother and little sister brought it home from the video rental store. After all, I would actually consider myself a fan of \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" and \\"Where the Heart Is.\\" Of course, knowing that Kirsten Dunst was in this film didn't hurt my curiosity level either. So, I sat back and did my best not to leave till the film was over. Honestly, it wasn't easy with this one.<br /><br />\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is the story of  Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), an early-bird bra-burner and art-history teacher in the 1950s who has moved from California to the East Coast to teach at a private, highly conservative girls' college. Right away, she has personality conflicts with the students and faculty, particularly a know-it-all schoolgirl called \\"Betty\\"(Kirsten Dunst) who seems angry at everyone else in the world for not living up to her high standards. Betty's weapon of choice is the school newspaper, which she uses with deadly precision. But of course, the unsinkable Ms. Watson has the upper-hand thanks to her strong will, liberated point of view, and ability to charm those around her to her way of thinking. Before long, all the sassy students who once mimicked Betty are singing Ms. Watson's tune. They now have bigger things in mind for their futures than simply getting married and raising families. What a waste of time that would be! But every victory Ms. Watson has is repelled by another conflict, as the school's lessons of better living through housekeeping are insisted upon by those in charge, and fully supported by disgruntled student Betty. How things will end is anybody's guess...though this is a movie formula we've seen many times before.<br /><br />It's a pretty common movie plot. A new, slightly more evolved teacher comes into a classroom and has to fight for acceptance and change. This time it's the 1950s, and the conflicts stem from the era's view of a woman's role in society. Okay, all of that is pretty tolerable. Still could be a good, even great film. The problem lies in its one-sidedness (I won't even go into its mostly negative presentation of the male gender). In all its preaching of tolerance, liberal Hollywood cannot tolerate the idea that being an individual might involve making one's own decisions. Here the lesson is: \\"Be an individual by doing what the new, liberal teacher thinks is right.\\" Not the lesson they more than hint at, which is to think for yourself. It is just beyond these moviemakers to believe that some folks might not want careers. Some might actually want to get married before they're old and focus their lives on raising their children, and it doesn't always mean they're ignorant or have been brainwashed. Of course, everyone should make that choice on their own, and be free to, but it's not progress to look down upon those who choose to be full-time moms. Looking around at the current state of the world, I can't help but think we could use more of them. But don't get me wrong, I'm not leaning to one side or the other as a rule for all women. I just felt that the movie was. As for me, I've always had a thing for professional women. The entertainment profession anyway. Speaking of, while I've always thought Julia Roberts resembled the Jersey Devil a tiny bit, Kirsten Dunst looked absolutely gorgeous in this movie, even as the misled baddie. It was hard not to love her, even though they did a good job of making her out to be brainwashed, and subconsciously frustrated by it. Her performance here was one of her best. No complaints about any of the cast really. Great performances. I'll admit that Ms. Robert's acting always looks effortless.  Julia Stiles also has a significant role as a student whois torn between marriage and college, and plays it well, as does Maggie Gyllenhaal in the role of the promiscuous student. As it sounds though, all the characters are pretty basic, cookie cutter creations. There's the promiscuous girl, the mean and arrogant girl, the smart but unconfident girl, (*deep breath* ) the slightly chubby girl who is still cute but everyone tells her she's not because females are even more superficial than males when you come down to it. *phew* And that's the whole movie when you come down to it. It's been spoken of and makes itself out to be a movie that should have taken the Oscar, but it's all pretty cookie cutter, with a slightly TOO \\"I'm right and you're wrong\\" attitude. Alright for an evening when you have nothing else to do if you dig chick movies, but not a keeper unless you're really into one or more members of the cast.marriage and college, and plays it well, as does Maggie Gyllenhaal in the role of the promiscuous student.

B00004U56N|5.0|Everybody who has any respect for jazz at all should have this album.  It is like a little slice of heaven.  Coltrane and Cannonball are in top form; Cannonball is his usual energetic self, inventing contours within the minimalistic chord changes, and Coltrane is in modified Giant Steps mode, tearing through thick sheets of sound and offering a contrasting view to the more work he was doing on his own, which had so much underlying complexity.  Many say that Bill Evans did his best playing with this group (or maybe that was just Miles...) and the rhythm section as a whole provides a perfect and quite evocative backdrop for Miles' understated elegance.  But for all jazz fans' raving about this CD, many people buy it and are diappointed because of how chill it is.  I was disappointed because I thought Miles wasn't doing anything, but the simply beauty and perfect delicacy of his spontaneous melodies are the main selling point of this album.
B0001US8FI|4.0|ENTER THE DRAGON Two-Disc Special Edition (Warner) is not only the best Bruce Lee movie but the best Kung Fu film (sorry, Quentin). It's been 30 years since Lee's untimely death andfor me, he's still the ultimate martial arts action guy in the movies.<br />This double disc has several compelling documentaries that examine Lee's life and skills. A special treat is previously unseen footage of Lee in action.<br />Disc Two includes John Little's feature length biography Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey with a meticulous reconstruction of Lee's intended cut of The Game of Death.
B00006879E|4.0|I rated 4 stars (instead of 5) because of the album's first song (stinks!)...<BR>This young guy must have studied Stevie Wonder - he's picked up Wonder's nuances as well as much of his style but added much of his own. This Love is his most popular song, but in my opinion, what sets this group as being unique and cuts them apart from everyone else is their song, Secret.  The lyrics are great and the melody you'll play over and over once you've heard it. Sorry if I'm rambling (I'm 58 but I love good popular music), and I asked my daughter &amp; her fiance if we could hear Secret at their wedding reception. Buy this album and look for this group at the Grammies.
B00004WG2X|4.0|I must agree with the reviewers that find the BBC version truer to the book.  The actors better protrayed their characters in line with the manners of that time.  The pacing of the story is slow and the setting is not as visually striking as the A&E version.  The costumes are very good though.    The A&E version is a visual feast. The story is paced well and the set and costumes are beautiful.  However, there is a more modern spin on the story.  The actors did a wonderful job but their portrayal of their characters was not quite in line with society of that period.  There was not enough reserve of emotions that was displayed in the book.    I can't say that I liked one version over the other.  If you want a truer version of the book, you will be most impressed with the BBC version.  If you want a feast for the eyes, the A&E version would be your preference.  I own both.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|This movie is so tacky. It was easy to predict what would happen next and as it did, I cringed in my seat. Running to the airport to say &quot;I Love You&quot;, how cliche and cheezy. I begged that it wouldn't happen but all of the extremely ridiculuous and unimaginative love scenarios broke through. Credit to Emma Thompson for her excellent role, but other than that, I was so glad when it was finally over, and then I apologized to my friend for dragging her to see such a waste of film. How ridiculuous was Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister! All he has in common with Tony Blair is that he's British.

B000002P2V|5.0|Do you not recognize an awesome rock and roll record when you hear it ? Who Are You is every bit as raucus and edgy as anything the Who ever recorded. The anger that gives it this edginess comes through in New Song, Had Enough, Sister Disco, Music Must Change and the title track. 905 is the progressive sounding track, but does not sound significantly out of character for the Who, in my estimation. My favorite song on this album is Guitar and Pen, a loud, fast, rollicking gem. Must be played at the appropriate volume to be appreciated.<br />This is probably my favorite Who album - it is definitely of the same high caliber as Who's Next. The bad reviews it gets are a travesty, a sham and a mockery - a traveshamockery !! (Amazon.com needs to be more diligent in removing reviews that are clearly someone goofing on the system.) Do not let them stop you from buying this record. If you like the Who at all, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|true, the book is much deeper (and in my opinion, better) than the play. the play is simply entertaining sentimental fluff. however the songs are still amazing to listen to over and over again (and isn't that what broadway is REALLY all about? entertainment?)Chenoweth's voice is so pure and constant, and Menzel has a powerful set of pipes. the songs are all &quot;cute&quot; and fun to sing along to. wicked is one of those plays that you either hate or love after the first time you see it. most people i know love it. i am one of those people...
B000002AS3|5.0|With this album Oasis made British rock n roll cool again.  After the demise of fellow Mancs, The Stone Roses, the British rock scene grew stale.  Definitely Maybe reignited it with cocksure arrogance accompanied with a pop friendly beat and rip roaring anthems.  The working class had a band to answer &quot;student&quot; groups like Radiohead.  Living in the &quot;black economy&quot;, Oasis gave the rest of the world a glimpse into their lives much like Gangsta Rap gave white America a glimpse of inner city life.  Songs like \\"Bring it on Down\\", \\"Supersonic\\", and \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\" spoke of a drug fueled existence.  While &quot;Rock N Roll Star&quot; showed their self assured attitude.  \\"Live Forever\\" is the stand out track and sums up the whole Brit Pop period so much so it was chosen as the title for a movie on the period.  Noel Gallagher writes the songs but vocalist Liam Gallagher takes it and makes it his own, he could be the Ronald Reagan of 90's music scene.  One of the best rock albums of all time I highly recommend it for any serious music fan.

For starters, there's the opening shot of Depp's shack, with the camera panning in over the water.  Now, hasn't this panning-in-over-the-water-in-double-mix-up-type-thrillers thing been a little run into the ground?  The secret ground?  I guess not, because here it is again, ladies and germs, right on the fuggin screen at a multiplex near you.  At least you wont be startled by the unfamiliar.

You know those characters you seen Johnny Depp portraying, like in films long ago?  Weeeeel, he's gonna be portraying them all over again in this \\"new\\" flick.  Yep, you'll thrill to seeing Raoul Duke reincarnated as some kind of degnerate writer who shacks up in a cabin with a cleaning lady he cannot stand to have around.  Why don't he just fire her?  Hey, listen honeybabe, then we wouldn't have a picture, now would we.  On the subject of Johhnny Deppp, the poor fellow should be sent to quirkaholics anonymous, he done should.

Then I'll open the door and you can slap my face.<br />Now, to change gears a hair, on the subject of Koepp, my diagnosis is that he did up a few tubes of glue in the car on the way over to the scriptwriters' meeting, then - during the meeting - went inno the bathroom and got busy with some aerosol cans.  This is the only possible explanation for the lousiness of this script.  You know, he goes back to the meeting and the writers are tryina tell him the script is lousy but he's flying so high on Frazee paint fumes that he don't hear a thing.  Hey, listen, Koepp, I've been there, knowhamsayin?  But listen, honeybabe, put the paper bag down, and step away from it.  Which brings us to the subject of Stephen King.<br />All I can really find to say about King is that if I was his wife, I would be getting pretty frookin nervous by now.  First the Shining and now this?

B0000667RO|3.0|It just surprises me when it really comes to hits collections. They really don't seem to hit the nail on the head. It really isn't anything new here, especially when a better hits collection by the same artist was issued earlier. Bryan Adams truly knows about making great songs, but not always hits collections. During his beginnings in the 80's, he defied the feeling of Rock music and Pop combined. That still hasn't changed here. His music is still as universal, with a lot of strength that people think of a guilty pleasure. Well, he might seem like that right now, but there is more to this Canadian than guilty.<br />The Best Of Me, the second Bryan Adams Greatest Hits collection of his big songs from the 80's and 90's. All in all, the songs here include his biggest hits from the era, including his biggest movie ballads, Everything I Do (I Do It For You) from Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman? from Don Juan Demarco, as well as other great pop songs to his career. The album also includes other great songs that were also on his earlier hits collection such as Summer Of '69, Can Start This Thing We Started, and Run To You. The album also adds some other goodies such as Back To You from his appearance on MTV Unplugged, Cloud Number Nine, and Let's Make A Night To Remember.<br />There also are some downsides to this collection, the album does overlook some of Bryan's die hard hits from the 80's such as Heaven, This Time, Cuts Like A Knife, It's Only Love his duet with Tina Turner, and other good songs. Those songs were featured on his earlier hits collection, So Far So Good from 1993. All in all, fans might seem a whole lot uninterested in this collection, but is a strong welcome to any Bryan Adams and his strong feel in music. If this was combined with the other hits collection, than more people would've bought The Best Of Me. Still, Bryan Adams quality hasn't changed in the music, and people still appreciate his music today, straight from that heart.m that heart.
B0002234LS|4.0|I know that I read &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden,&quot; the Stephen King novella that was the basis for David Koepp's 2004 film, but I had no conscious memory of the story when I sat down to watch the movie.  But either I remembered something deep down inside or it was a mistake to cast Timothy Hutton, who starred in movie version of King's &quot;The Dark Half,&quot; in a supporting role in this film because I quickly got to the point where I was wondering if I was reading the film wrong simply because it seemed so obvious to me what was going on.<br />The main attraction here is Johnny Depp, because he is one actor who can be counted on never to do anything boring and whose flair for eccentricity and his devotion to odd roles is now being taken as a sign of genius.  Depp plays Mort Rainey, a writer who is out in the woods in a cabin, starring at a poorly written opening paragraph that is not getting any better.  It soon becomes clear that his writer's block is the result of the fact he is in divorcing proceedings with his wife, Amy (Maria Bello); the opening scene of the film shows us the heart of that trauma.  Struggling to deal with these twin demons Rainey is confronted by the sudden appearance of John Shooter (John Turturro), a forbidding looking figure who accuses the writer of plagiarizing a story and demands he put things to rights.<br />Mort is conflicted about his marriage and has no idea what to do with the blank sheet of paper in his typewriter.  He wants to be definite about having written the story &quot;Secret Window,&quot; but apparently in his deep dark past he plagiarized a story once and given the state he was in when he wrote the story, there just might be something about Shooter's claim.  Clearly Mort is at a crossroads where his future could well be in peril (Come on, this is a Stephen King story; this guy is toast).<br />Depp's performance is captivating.  It has to be, because he has a lot of scenes where it is just him and his blind dog or the mirror on the wall.  But do not neglect the work of screenwriter-director Koepp (&quot;Panic Room&quot;), which you are not really going to be able to appreciate until the second time you watch &quot;Secret Window&quot; (in between watch the featurettes where the director give some key insights into what he was trying to do with the film).  I would probably have liked this film more if I had gotten so far ahead of the curve, but I am still impressed with the craftsmanship of the lead actor and the directorog or the mirror on the wall.

B000002VJH|5.0|Album starts off with a great funky song, Slip Knot/Help on the Way which breaks down into one of the tightest segments of Dead jam I've ever heard( the part with the repeating guitar riffs over the steady drumbeat before the guitar solo at the end). The first song transitions beautifully into Franklin's Tower, a classic in and of itself.<BR>     The next song is a nice instrumental piece with an excellent percussive emphasis. Bob Weir follows up with one of his better tunes, &quot;The Music Never Stopped,&quot; a feel-good number that makes you want to groove and dance. &quot;Crazy Fingers&quot; complements the dance feel with a smooth near-reggae guitar beat that is certain to ease and please.<BR>     The last two songs of the album are the only weak spots. The end of the album is your obligatory, &quot;trippy&quot; part of the album and tends to drone on and on. I like experimental, free-form imporvisational music, but the ending is quite tedious to listen to.<BR>     Overall, great album, only second to Workingman's Dead in my opinion.
B0000025P9|4.0|This is the best TOTO album they made and is an essential belonging in somebody who likes music's  collection. It´s from 1.982 and its production -to my point- made it an essential one in the following music production from the 80's.<br />This is where Toto sounded like an armonyzed orchestra. The songs and maybe more important, the arrangements marked the sound of the following years... You could listen different artists in following years, 84, 85...and quality then meaned to sound like Toto IV. I never understood the absolute change of pace and sound that marked the following FARENHEIT and ISOLATION -although this was a good one-. In TOTO IV they found the sound they were always looking for in Toto, Hydra and Turn Back.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne doesn't really adjust her attitude for &quot;Under My Skin&quot; -- she still comes across as the kid sister from a safe suburban family, who's in that &quot;I'm dark and edgy, bad grrl me!&quot; phase. In her sophmore album, she stays on familiar turf with recycled guitar pop and limp songwriting.<br />Things don't kick off to a good start with a bit of messy synth, and the announcement &quot;I cannot find a way to describe it&quot; at the start of &quot;Take Me Away.&quot; Following it is the raggedly cliched &quot;Together,&quot; the bouncy you-let-me-down &quot;My Happy Ending,&quot; light rock &quot;Nobody's Home,&quot; and the chest-beating &quot;Freak Out.&quot; Most overrated is the tepid, poppy &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; a mix of abstinence and girl-power anthem that doesn't live up to its promise.<br />The general themes are pretty much the same -- she's been let down in affairs of the heart, and she's a tough, unafraid, does-her-own-thing rock chick. Neither is particularly heartfelt -- she insists that she doesn't care, that she's strong and isn't afraid, then puts out helpless cries of &quot;Please cry with me&quot; and &quot;I can't handle this confusion.&quot; Be vulnerable or tough, but make up your mind.<br />Lavigne's voice is pretty much standard pop stuff -- she can hold a note, but can't make it rise, and her voice is suited to the tepid guitar pop that is played behind her. The music itself is pop masquerading as rock -- dig down past the electric guitars and limp basslines, and you'll find basic, repetitive pop rhythms. It's fairly catchy, but almost instantly forgettable.<br />Lavigne actually pens some of the songs solo this time around, although most are cowritten with songwriting team the Matrix. Unfortunately, neither solo or cowritten songs are much good. &quot;Na na,&quot; &quot;ah ah&quot; and &quot;oh oh&quot; are written in as part of the lyrics, which include such gems as &quot;Walk around with my hands/up in the air/cause I don't care&quot; and the cringingly awful &quot;How does it feel to be/different from me?&quot; MTV pop poetry doesn't get much more insightful than that.<br />Teen pop queen Avril Lavigne still wavers helplessly between vulnerability and I'm-a-tough-girl-don't-mess-with-me, all behind a wall of canned guitar pop and tepid songwriting. It gets &quot;Under My Skin,&quot; all right... like a splinter.ause I don't care&quot; and the cringingly awful &quot;How does it feel to be/different from me?&quot; MTV pop poetry doesn't get much more insightful than that.<br />Teen pop queen Avril Lavigne still wavers helplessly between vulnerability and I'm-a-tough-girl-don't-mess-with-me, all behind a wall of canned guitar pop and tepid songwriting.

B000268QB2|3.0|Keane is in a very unoriginal way, a great band.  They are not up to anything different than their ancestors the Beatles were nor do they mark new territory from more recent bands like Travis and Coldplay.  They do strike an interesting balance and in extrapolate on the Brit-pop theme in some new interesting ways.  <br />The comparisons to Coldplay and in terms of the high tenor vocals, Travis are rightminded but not wholely explanitory.  Keane sounds vaguely like both but resides clearly in the middle ground between the two.  All three have natural pop sensability but Coldplay has mastered it to the delight of college students and TRL veiwers everywhere.  Keane strikes tender balance between the pure &quot;U2 pop&quot; of Coldplay and the &quot;Why wait for tomorrow when I could kill myself now-Pop&quot; of Travis.  Keane's album is about heartbreak but their taking it pretty well.  Where Travis becomes sad and Coldplay waxes epic, Keane seems overly dramatic.  <br />There are copius references to waking, light, and sleep pointing towards a simplistic metaphor of love and heartbreak.  They continue to riff on these dramatic characterizations of love throughout the album and some of their chord progressions seem more reminisant of Broadway than of Oasis.   There are some tracks that survive the showtune treatment and shine.  &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; is the obvious single and despite its troubling placement as track one remains a good song.  &quot;Everybody's Changing&quot; has by far the most infectious piano riff on the entire album but the chorus is a near let down.  The true mastery of Keane comes across in &quot;She Has No Time&quot;.  Not only does the song take a more reasonable tempo from the frantic pace of other parts of the album but the high tenor of the chorus allows the vocals to shine at their most clean and most challenging.<br />Hopes and Fears is a good record and is sufficently off the beaten path of Coldplay to make some interesting revelations but as for piano pop, I'd wait for the new Folds album or wait for &quot;Clocks&quot; to come out on Now Thats What I Call Music 168.  You won't be dissapointed but you won't be blown away either.
B000089RVX|3.0|Ok first things first I keep seeing people comper Evanescence to Nightwish and Lacuna Coil. Well guess what people Nightwish is not like Evanescence in any way shap or form. They are not a goth band. <BR>Evanescence is a goth band. They are far to different to even comper.<br />Know on to the Lacuna Coil thing. Again the bands are not the same. Go download old Evanescence and you will see what I mean. <br />Ok know on to the album. It is good not great but good. I thank this band for getting me into other metal band that blow the Nu-metal bands out of the water. Eva is one of the few US bands that I like.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I must admit, I've always been a fan of the heavier styles of music, but when my friend brought me a copy of his cd, I was blown off my feet.  It was amazing!  I love the way that they were able to not only play the heavier style, but back off into a more subtle strain for a bit.  It all just flowed together so well, from the intro's to the exciting riffs and bridges.  It's simply beautiful.
0553381687|5.0|Even though it's pretty long and doesn't really end, this is solid fantasy. Very dark and grim. Not for the faint of heart! There is graphic violence and sex, but the story is great with lots of twists and turns.
0061015725|5.0|I've read some of the other reviews and have seen a lot of criticism I found somewhat unjust.  Giving this book one star just because it was written in a new style is just one example of that. Despite the fact that from time to time the plot felt a bit &quot;Hollywood-ish&quot; it was a fun read.  I finished the book in 2 days! I simply couldn't put it down.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Martin Scorcese's grand, sweeping epic of gang violence amidst the riots against the 1863 Conscription Act is at once compelling, engrossing, and original. Nominated for several Academy Awards but stiffed, especially for the Best Picture award, this film failed to garner the praise it could have because post 9-11, Americans did not want to see a vision of America's roots in violence, xenophobia, and political corruption.<br />The film begins with a battle between the Irish Catholic immigrant gang known as the Dead Rabbits, lead by Priest Vallon, against the xeonophobic Native Americans, lead by William Cutting, better known was Bill the Butcher. The battle ends as the child of Vallon, Amsterdam, watches his father dishonorably cut down by the Butcher, and, as he is shipped off to reform school, swears vengeance. The next scene shows Amsterdam, now fully-grown, leaving reform school, tossing his Bible into the ocean. As Amsterdam maneuvers his way into the Butcher's inner circle, he begins a relationship with Cutting's former lover, a female thief named Jenny, and begins building an army of gang members who unite against the tyrannical rule of the Natives. As Amsterdam sets in motion his ploy for vengeance, the Butcher makes an alliance with Boss Tweed, a powerful political leader, who plays his own game when he comes to Amsterdam to guarantee the Irish vote for his candidates. These events unfold against the racism fueled by the Civil War and the proposal of the draft, which culminates in the Draft Riots.<br />The best things about the film are Scorcese's always-excellent direction, the brilliant time capsule of the screenplay, and the much-acclaimed potrayal of Bill the Butcher by Daniel-Day Lewis. The last of these is both terrifying and mesmerizing, with Lewis portraying a character who attains power because of an admirable devotion to a cause. However, this cause happens to be racism and xenophobia. Cutting is ruthless and unyielding, but portrays moments of conflict, particularly in his honoring and admiration of his fallen enemy.<br />Leonardo Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz, as Amsterdam and Jenny, are less compelling than the spellbinding Lewis, but still manage to be capable, particularly Dicaprio in his semi-nuanced portrayal of a ruthless boy on the cusp of manhood seeking to avenge the death of his father. Amsterdam becomes a hero to his people, but defending their needs is always secondary to his lust for revenge. Diaz is competent, but ends up taking up space as a kind of foil for Dicaprio and another facet for the feud between Amsterdam and the Butcher. <br />All in all, GONY is an excellent film. While it has its flaws, it was definetly the best film of 2002, and was robbed mostly because of the unwillingness of Americans to accept their history.
0778320448|4.0|A cozy story about friendships and babies! The characters were very believable and well-rounded with great stories, even if a couple of the plots were tiny bit predictable. I wish there had been more involvement with the knitting angle. All the male love interests knights in shining amour, but I guess we need that every now and then. Regardless, this is a sweet book that will leave you feeling inspired and happy!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|You know, I just don't understand some of you who have taken to rating Slipknot's albums.  Now I know this doesn't go for all of you as some of you have made informed comments and expressed your opinions well concerning the bands music.  However, there is just no pleasing the rest of you, is there?  Apparently the first album was crap because it was too 'Nu-Metal' and had too many hip-hop influences on it.  'Iowa' was even worse because it was too heavy and too nihilistic and you condemned them as posers for releasing it.  Now that 'Vol. 3' has come out, everyone is complaining about the bands new sense of direction.  I even read someone's comments as that they have \\"Just constructed heavy filler to surround the ultra melodic choruses.\\"  Have you even listened to this album?  Or just gone in with an idea of what it SHOULD sound like??  Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Slipknot originally formed to break all the boundaries suffocating the music industry back in the late 90's and to attempt to eliminate pompous rock-star posturing and over-inflated egos?  Some may say that the jump suits and masks became a gimmick along the way, but their intentions were clearly discernable.  A lot more people have said that Corey and James should have left the Slipknot name in tact by sticking with Stone Sour and not 'destroying' what Slipknot was all about.  Excuse me, but are you guys in the band?  I'm assuming not because of all the interviews I have read, the entire band thinks that this is their masterpiece, their \\"Abbey Road or Who's Next\\", and thus far, I would have to agree.  Where on the first two albums, it was mainly Joey, James and Corey doing most of the song writing, the WHOLE band had its hands on this one.  You can hear it in the dual soloing guitar attack ala Iron Maiden and the larger part that Craig and Sid have on this album.  This is probably why it is far more intricate and multi-faceted then their previous works.  Corey has been quoted as saying that his singing and lyrical content is both \\"brutal and beautiful\\".  I for one praise him and the boys for being so courageous in the face of such an inflexible fan base.  They have gone out on a limb and exposed different sides of themselves in an attempt to become more then what they are, more then a band that is only known for its masks and brutality.  They have opted to grow and for that we all owe them.  Too many bands stick to their original blueprint, like Limp Bizkit, and refuse to grow thus trapping themselves in their own personas and their fans expectations for the rest of their careers.  What happens to those bands?  They lose all their credibility and they become as dated as the C&C Music Factory or Flock of Seagulls is to us now.  The guitarist for my old band once said that \\"Fans never want their bands to change but as an artist you are always striving to become something more, something greater then what you were.\\"  So before you gripe about how they have `sold-out' and that you will never listen to them again, take a step back and look at what they have attempted here.  Look down the road 10 or 20 years, when this whole scene has been forgotten and you're life is unrecognizable from what it is now.  Remember that this band tried to make a statement and shoot for career longevity instead of becoming another footnote in the annals of music history.  They tried becoming something you wouldn't be ashamed to say you listened to like that Hanson or Ace of Base CD stuffed away quietly in the back of your closet.    Here's to the next CD and the hope that someone will read this and give this amazing album another well deserved spin.
0786860707|5.0|poopypants is unbelievably clueless.  I first read this book when I was in high school, and it was out of print.  The temptation to steal the book was overwhelming!  About 8 years ago, it came back into print and I immediately bought it.<br />If all you're looking for is some hold-my-hand-and-teach-me-how-to-draft-sequential-drawings-book , check out Tony White's book, or Preston Blair's excellent text, or one in the Juvenile section of the library, but if you want to know how to *breathe life into your animation*, this books is a MUST HAVE.  Period.<br />Also check out Richard William's \\"The Animator's Survival Kit\\" for a good \\"sequel\\" (in a way), and some advanced nuts & bolts stuff.<br />This is still the single best animation book available, and will be the animation \\"bible\\" for years to come.  I'm at a loss as to why someone wouldn't be able to glean an amazing amount of wisdom from this book - it confounds me.
B0002234LS|3.0|Were it not for the usual deft Johnny Depp performance, this movie would pass unnoticed for good reasons. The story is transparent and were it not for Depp's ability to make the most out of very little, this lame Stephen King toss-off would be almost without merit.  Despite the corny plot there are some transient moments of fright and others of true, finely finessed comedy in the body language and facial expressions of Depp.  The cast is otherwise mostly not seen or heard, but when they are they are adequate - Maria Bello as the wife that has nothing positive about her, Timothy Hutton, Charles Dutton, Len Cariou, and John Turturro in a flat, wasted role. Worth watching for Depp's bravura, but you'll know the ending form the beginning if you are a Stephen King fan.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|k, this cd rocks. Awesome rock tracks but yet still some nice ballads. Slipped Away you can tell is a very very personnal song.

B000003CMB|5.0|This album is a winner in all the width of the word. Despite the fact three are gone since this historical recital in Fillmore, this muiscla document hasn't aged a bit.<br />Duane Allman made possible this triumph. The deep engagement among the musician is unusual. They bleneded with the same eficiency , jazz, blues and rock &amp; roll. To get this youneed an ensamble and also being in good shape, mood and virtuosity.<br />In my opinion this album matchs with Uriah Heep live , Deep purple made in Japan , Hendrix in Woodstock ,The Who live at Ledds ,How the west was won's Led Zepellin.<br />I mean we are talking about giant albums unusual rapports moments ; rapture inspirations .<br />Don't think it over. Ask your friends , because you never will obtain a negative answer. This album belongs in rock to an equal level than A Kind of blue of Miles Davis.<br />The mythical themes as In memoriam of Elizabeth Reed or You don't love me are the best prrof that this ensemble went far beyond the standard level to make their own signature in the Immortality Hall of the rock music in any age.
B00005JN0A|4.0|I'll be the first to admit I was very skeptical about this film. The trailer doesn't do much for the film unless you've fantasized about the female lead (Michelle Trachtenberg), which is disturbing at least for me since I remember her as sweet little Harriet The Spy but perhaps I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. The film begins sometime during the high school graduation of Scott Thomas and his pals. During a family photo-opt Scotty gets dumped by his girlfriend all the while the family continues snapping pictures of their son's big day. Flash -forward to the senior party where Matt Damon struts his stuff as a punk rocker in the funniest cameo I've seen in years. The catchy \\"Scotty Doesn't Know\\" says it all. Like many teen movies there's the gratuitous nudity surprisingly and disturbingly there's a nudist beach scene featuring full frontals of middle-aged men. It's nice to see women aren't the only ones objectified in this flick but then again....gross. There are the nonsensical plot twists and the movie seems to fly by rather quickly. This film is no Road Trip (necessarily not a bad thing anything without Tom Green sucking face with a mouse deserves three stars) and remains light, funny and just downright fun. And kudos to Michelle for not displaying her cans on screen.

B000001GX8|5.0|Karl Bohm knew how to conduct Mozart better than just about anyone else; his speeds were often slower than usual, which meant that the words in the operas were always clear, and his rhythmic resilience and attention to detail avoided any feeling of heaviness. The duet &quot;Che soave zeffiretto&quot; sounds more sensuous here than on any other recording. And on what other recording of &quot;Figaro&quot; are the plucked strings in &quot;Voi che sapete&quot; so noticeable? Bohm is helped by an exceptionally strong cast. The women, in particular, are glorious: Gundula Janowitz sings the difficult role of the Countess with incomparable purity, and she's ideally contrasted with Edith Mathis's Susanna. (Their voices blend wonderfully in their duet). Tatiana Troyanos is at her richest as Cherubino. The men aren't quite at this exalted level, but they acquit themselves well: Fischer-Dieskau's Count is much more strongly characterized than most, and Prey, if not the most ebullient of Figaros, sings with a satisfyingly warm, mellow sound. DG's sonics are, on the whole, first-rate. With an absolutely complete text, this is an essential purchase.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|...bringing me home from a vacation in the Galapagos. Wonderful coincidence. I could look at the screen and say &quot;Hey, I was just there!&quot;<br />That said, this movie failed utterly to capture the personae of Aubrey and Maturin. Like most movies based on great books, it was a disapointment. But, the special effects were dramatic enough. I suppose if you haven't read any of O'Brian's books, it's entertaining enough. But, rent, don't buy. It's not that good.
B00000JKH2|5.0|This CD is absolutely perfect. Every song on it is equally amazing. By far their best CD.

I honestly look at people in their cars when i listen to this, and i KNOW that whatever they are listening to could never be as good as VAYA. Don't be without music this good.

B00005Y7L4|5.0|This movie is truly awesome.  It works on every level from social commentary/satire, horror, action, drama, romance, and just pure fun.  This is what people who dismiss subtitled films are really missing out on.  Now that I'm done gushing, I'll give you the review.  The film involves a group of around 40 students in a classroom that has been randomly chosen for the government's BR (Battle Royale....duh!) program.  The children are gassed and placed on a secluded island where they are shown a hilariously satirical (and extremely upbeat) instructional video instructing them that they are to kill each other and the last boy or girl standing gets to go home.  Each student receives a package containing water, map, compass, etc. and a weapon, some useless like a soup pot lid and some lethal, such as a sickle or even a machine gun.  Any resistance explodes a steel collar that has been placed around each student's neck.  Let the carnage begin!  Kill Bill fans will recognize one familiar face in the brilliantly psychotic Chiaki Kuriyama (minus her ball-and-chain).  As the killfest commences, different strategies emerge.  Some students seek and destroy their former comrades while others band together and hide out and some simply do themselves in rather than participate in the blood bath. Some even hatch a plot to hack into the BR computer system and bring the battle to a halt.  Then there's that mysterious \\"exchange student\\" who showed up in class for the first time on the day of the Battle Royale and seems just a little too thrilled with it all as he mows down everyone he comes across without a word. So much fun! You see each and every death and the movie counts down the students as they die until it's all over.  The battles are very gritty and real; sorry, no kung fu or anime-style sword battles.  This is the most enjoyable foreign film I've seen since Versus, and this is by far the better film.  If you have even heard of this movie you owe it to yourself to own it.  It begs to be watched again and again.  Heck, with such a strong premise, Battle Royale could be a franchise in the making; it could literally be remade a dozen ways and still kick ass.  Anyhow check it out, you won't be dissappointed.s to be watched again and again.

0790731452|1.0|There are so many reasons why I hate this movie.  However, the thing that really bugged me was how they attached the woman's head to a dog, that was really messed up.
B0001ZX0OM|5.0|Yeah, it is one of the best of 2003. For me, it was Sean Penn all along, it came as no surprise when he won the Oscar for this particular role in which he was absoloutely BRILLIANT. The other actors build around him were flawlessly played by Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, And Laurence Fishburn. Nice work!
B0000029DD|5.0|I don't think I will need many words to say that for me, this is one of the most beautiful album ever written. Jeff Buckley's voice really did come from heaven and he will forever be eternally missed but his music will keep on touching my heart like no other. Thank you Mister Buckley, may you be with the angels, where you belong.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Very interesting movie. Good story, lots of action. Great music! One of my favorite movies this year 2004. I have seen it about 4 times. I can't seem to get enough of it. I also have a copy of Kill Bill I &amp; II.
B000002L68|5.0|This CD brings back so many memories of 1984-I was staioned overseas in the military that year, and those were some great times, and some not so great times.  Lots of partying, and the music from this CD takes me back to that period . '84 was a long year with many ups and downs, and Purple Rain transports me back to those times. I really didn't care much for Prince before \\"Purple Rain\\", but when I first heard this album, it was a must have, and I have been a Prince fan ever since. Whenever I play this, I wish I could go back to that year, if even for a second. This is a great additon to my '80s collection, along with Hall and Oates, Billy Ocean, Madonna, Def Leopard, Rick James Teena Marie and scores of others. This, IMO, is Prince's best work EVER..I will go on to say one of the albums that defined the 80s and changed the musical landscape forever. This is a must have for any pop music fan, in addition to the movie.
0141000198|5.0|Sometimes you just need a book full of personality to take your mind off of . . . whatever. Turn off your critical lobe, and put on your flip flops. Bridget Jones is the let-it-all-hang-out heroine a hot summer day needs. Just enjoy, and you shouldn't be disappointed.
B000002J0B|5.0|I remember in 1973 when the radio first advertised this new Led Zep LP was coming out.  They played a few sound bits of Plant's new voice.  It sounded so different than their previous four albums that I wasn't so sure.  I bought it anyway because it was Led Zeppelin after all.  Later that year I saw them live and was of course, blown away.<br />Still, there is no denying that Houses of the Holy was a new kind of music for this band.  There are some new sounds on here that do not resemble the previous LPs.  However, it is Plant, Page, Bonham and Jones at their creative peak.  Led Zep peaked with this album.  Although the band stayed together for several more years after this one, this was one of their best three efforts (the others being Led Zep 2 and Led Zep 4).  Its a must have.
B000286RZM|5.0|Another great record by John Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer. This time around he recorded this effort in a span of 5 days and the finished peice is raw yet beautiful. This album marks the first in a series of albums to be released in the upcoming months. When John made 'Shadows Collide with People' he said how he wanted to prove people wrong about saying he couldnt make a album that wasn't messed up (i.e. Niandra LaDes and Smile From the Streets you Hold). He came through with a wonderful \\"production\\" record. On 'The Will to Death' the songs are stripped, but easy to listen to, and a pleasure to hear. This is a must for any Frusciante fan and a great album by a very gifted songwriter.
B000002J1F|4.0|Some very well written reviews already appear in this list.  As a long time Yes fan (Yes, I remember when this one hit the shelves), Fragile stands out as a classic LP.  The only other two that top it for me are The Yes Album (1971) and Close to the Edge (1973).  And, I would have to rate the compilation album &quot;Yesterdays&quot; a fourth best.<br />I too feel that Kaye was underrated.  It may have taken this album for Wakeman to get comfy in Yes.  By the time Close to the Edge rolled around, he had found himself.  For that reason, I would say that Fragile was a transitional ablum for this group.  Its too bad that they went down the tubes just a few years later with Relayer in '74.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Well despite the fact that audience reactions are quite split, that will not change the fact that it was one of the most critically praised films of 2003. And it deserved to be for the simple fact that the movie became apart of the viewers who enjoyed it. Well really the movie was what you made it. Was it a love story? Was it a story about loneliness? Was it a story about the possiblities of friendships? Was it a story about life changing encounters? Well there's no simple answer to that. It became a lot of things for me. It captured a sense of anxiety I had about the future and whether I or not I could find contentment in my life. It didn't give me an answer but it made me feel good that a film could show something like that. I'm glad the ending was left open because real life is like that. Bill Murray in my opinion gave one of the most honest and heartfelt performances in my recollection. Scarlett Johansson gave the movie it's dreamy feeling as she explored Tokyo and the possibilities of the future. And Sofia Coppola deserves much praise for making a film that really touched me and left me with a feeling that I won't always feel &quot;lost&quot;.
B0001HAISG|1.0|Peter Pan in this movie..is too..too normal boy.<BR>Too much feeling, and just pretend to hide it.<br />In the original tale, his feeling to Wendy..is not this way..I think. <BR>Actually, I think Peter's heart is quite cold instead.<BR>(although he is a kind of good boy)<br />Too much feeling of &quot;romantic&quot; movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|When I think of what a star means her name comes into my head. She manages to have a successful music career and keep people guessing, talking, and wondering what she has up her sleeve next. I still feel there is more Britney to come our way, she doesnt even need her last name to be recognized anymore. Her In The Zone album should be listened by her older fans and those who think they do not like her. A track like Brave New Girl shows elements of her older style while other tracks can be enjoyed by both adults and teens. If youre looking for a good time this is the cd for you
B00003CXC6|5.0|A man travelling with his wife in feudal Japan is murdered by a bandit... or is he? As the main protagonists - the bandit, the wife, a passer-by and (I kid you not) the man himself - tell their versions of events, a series of contradictions emerge. Who, if anyone, is telling the truth?<BR>Rashomon's Byzantine plot structure was unique at the time, and still feels fresh over half a century down the line. Presenting no easy answers (there is reason to doubt the motives, and thus the stories, of all of those involved), it leaves the audience to make up their own minds about who to trust. Fans of latterday head-spinning efforts such as The Usual Suspects and Memento will find plenty to get their teeth into here.<BR>It all looks gorgeous, to boot (Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography is done justice by an excellent DVD transfer here), and the performances - especially Toshiro Mifune, as the bandit Tajomaru, cackling hysterically and pausing mid-fight to swat mosquitoes on his neck - are superb. If I've got one gripe, it's the slightly pat &quot;redemptive&quot; ending, but that's a minor fault at best.<BR>Otherwise, Rashomon is downright essential. It's too easy to get all rose-tinted when trying to assess a long-established &quot;classic&quot;, but this is one that's more than stood the test of time.
B00006879E|5.0|I love this band so much! I bought the cd the first week it came out! I now have all their cds and just ordered Maroon5 Acoustic! All the songs are great i do not skip any! I very much think this is the best band ever!!!! They have a talent to make every song with a different beat or make a ballad!! I love this band and recommend buying this cd because they are worth the money!!!!!!! It also helps that Adam is very sexy, and that James, Jesse, Ryan, and Mickey are hottttt!!!!! SO the cd rules because they are hot and their music is awsome!!!
B00008S2VG|3.0|OK this is my third review for Madonna's \\"average\\", in it's own right, American Life effort.<br />This review board might as well be a messege board, because people are supposed to review the album, but instead we here about her tour, other albums, etc. <br />I just think it's sad when people can say that fans of Madonna are starting to get tired of an aging pop icon singing dance music. The irony of it is that just two years ago Madonna had the second biggest dance hit of her entire career. (behind Vogue) It was also this very hit that was the biggest selling single of the year, the biggest dance/club play single, and garnered a Grammy nod for record of the year. How can someone say that people are tired of an aging pop icon singing dance songs when Madonna lieterally dominates the dance chart. FYI you can check the very same source you saw Madonna's American Life effort drop quicker than the ray of light, which is Billboad, and you will see that Madonna dominates the dance charts and single sales. Madonna is pushing 40 for how many number 1 dance singles she's earned, so helllllloooooooo, check your information.<br />Ultimately what killed this album was the fact that Madonna pulled the original American Life video. Some of her fans felt as though that decision she made was tarnishing most of the career stunts she's made in the past, but oftenly said she had no regrets to. Literally, some fans thought she was throwing away her secret weapon that has earned her every right as the \\"queen of shock\\", she was losing her \\"shock.\\" Any other time Madonna would have released her video effrts regardless what factor it might degrade or who, but in this case she was afraid of being \\"Dixie Chicked,\\" causing her fans to come to the assumption that she isn't the Madonna, in which has garnered millions of fans worldwide. That killed the album, although it debuted at number 1, I guess some of the gay fans she's garnered couldn't live without a new Madonna album, other than listening to the same Hip-Hop/Rap and R&B crap (most of it) that they play on the radio. Let's be honest on Madonna's Hollywood, she was obviously talking about how music about gangster life (RAP) and bootys shakin (RAP) dominated the radio. \\"Music Stations alway play the same songs, I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong.\\" Some might say she knew she wasn't gonna get any airplay with this album. Call me crazy, but the same \\"Clear Channel\\" that people say blacklisted Madonna from airplay and media, is the same \\"Clear Channel\\" that's promoting her tour. . . .what if this was one of Madonna's stunts and she planned the whole thing . . . .then I would understand completely why the crown her the \\"queen of shock.\\" <br />Buy this album. It's good and you more than likely wont skip any songs, but ultimately, it's not her best, but not her worst either . . .let's say in between.
0060977493|5.0|This was an incredibly spellbinding story that I remember fondly years after having read it.  I marvel at the way the writer turned a series of horrible tragedies and dysfunctions into a beautiful tale that was a pleasure to read.  The detail is amazing.  For instance, the rainy season is described as when the pages of the books expand with the humidity.  The author definitely has a gift for description.
0688163173|4.0|Dennis Lehane seems to lead you down the path of a typical mystery/drama but in the latter half or third of the book is when the story shows its insidious psychologically twisted direction! This story is not really a mystery as opposed to a psychological thriller! Almost the way &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is supposed to be considered a psychological thriller and not a horror movie.  Kudos to Dennis Lehane for writing a book that requires the reader to engage their mind and decide the true ending of the book.
0316666343|4.0|A well constructed story of tragedy that is pleasant to read.  Felt like a lighter version of The God of Small Things in that regard.  Good character development and well paced.  I particularly enjoyed her imaginative rendition of what heaven is like.  I did not cry until the very end.
0783117523|4.0|Gia is a knockout, daring film.  It tells the true story of the rise and fall of 80's supermodel Gia Carrangi.  Many reviewers have said they never heard of Gia until the movie.  In the cruel fashion world, Gia was forgotten as fast as she became famous.  Not one person from the fashion industry attended her funeral.  The man who wrote the book on which this film was based also coined the term 'fashionista' for his book.  The word has since become a staple in the English language.<br />Angelina Jolie was made for this role; she deserved the awards and recognition she received for it.  If this film had been made for theaters rather than HBO, she should have won an Oscar.<br />In Gia, Gia/Jolie is the sun, and all the other characters revolve around her.  From her inauspicious beginnings in New York City to her photo shoots all over the world, Gia desperately seeks that which she was denied as a child - love.  The tragedy is that once she finally finds love, Gia is so scarred emotionally and from drugs, that she is unable to accept it.  Mercedes Ruel gives a masterful, subtle performance as Gia's self-centered mother who abandoned her daughter when she was 11.<br />The drugs, glamor, and glitz of the 80's fashion world are portrayed in both gritty and glamorous fashion.  One of the most striking scenes is when Gia is dressed for a photo shoot as a geisha in a red dress.  This scene is so riveting and well done I watched it a dozen times.  She is standing in a gritty alley with red paper lanterns hanging over the concrete.  The whole scene is surreal, and is a great portrayal of Gia's life and of the 80's.<br />Jolie keeps nothing inside for this performance.  She is naked, both physically and emotionally.  And the jazz soundtrack is captivating and mesmerizing.  In fact, I am seeking to purchase just the soundtrack.
B000294SFW|5.0|Motorhead, great speed-metal, biker-rock, party-rock, ... for a heavy-metal good time, BUY their music!  It is true, that some bad   consequences can lead to good thing, and Lemmy is no exception!  Here's a guy who was fired from the Hawkwind, because he was jailed for possession of &quot;illegal substances&quot;, and it seemed like he had no future left.  But Lemmy is a fighter, and Motorhead was the result, a victory over his former bosses!<br />I've always been a Motorhead fan, but it seems that in the earlier 90s, Lemmy, along with Mickey Dee (Mercyful Fate), their albums were more solid.  I actually liked Hammered better than their earlier materials, and Inferno is their best yet!  Just listen to &quot;The Killer&quot;, and I'm sure all true metal fans would agree.  They are still loud, aggressive, trust me, when you pick up Inferno, you're in for a wild ride!
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is an enchanting book, as long as it is good.  With over 900 pages, it is truly a painstakingly crafted creation worth the time invested to read it.  Women especially will enjoy it and feel empowered, as it goes way back to the old legend of the Goddess and the magic that only women can wield.<br />Marion Zimmer Bradley weaves this tale as colorfully and seamlessly as the ancient medieval tapestries hanging in the dank and chilly castles in the time of King Arthur.  Unlike the traditional telling, however, she also tells the story of the pagan people of the British isles subjected to Christianity and the traditions that carry on - in secret - to this day.  The characters of Arthur, Lancelot, Morgaine, and Guinevere are portrayed from youth to old age.  Many new and old characters are introduced as well.  After you read this book, you will never look at Camelot the same way again.
0679746048|4.0|I read the book after I'd seen the movie and was disappointed in the movie. It left a lot of things out, added some stuff and really obscured the timeline. <BR>The book however was captivating, I really had a hard time putting it down, and it's a very easy read. I enjoyed delving more into Susannna's mind learing what she was thinking during certain events in her life. It also puts a light onto early psychological techniques, which thank God have improved. One of my favorite parts in the book is were she starts to see her hand withouth bones, something that was mentioned shortly in the movie. The characters are thoroughtly mentioned in the book and even some you didn't seen in the movie, the funny thing is that Lisa the Angelina Joeli character didn't seem to play as big of a role in Susanna's life there. The movie seemed to focus maybe too much on the character since she was the more practical Hollywood mold, while the book of course is focused on Susanna.<BR>Anyway, it was a fun book to read and an easy one too, if you liked the movie you should read the book to learn more about what really happened to Susanna during her stay at the hospital.
B00011RPB0|1.0|The movie was just terrible and boring but reading the reviews on Amazon almost made it worthwhile!  After watching this, I was so amazed at how this 'acclaimed' film could be such a bomb that I was dying to see some comments by others who didn't &quot;get it.&quot;  I really got a kick out of some of the hilarious reviews.  Totally agree with whoever said that following almost any tourist around Tokyo for a few days with a camcorder would be as good as this.  Also laughed at the guy who said he considered liking this film a character flaw!  I rented this movie and &quot;Love Actually&quot; at the same time and they couldn't have been more opposite:  Lost In Translation: dull, pointless, pretentious.  Love Actually:  entertaining, upbeat, well-written.  Gotta say I love this website.
1594200106|5.0|For the true romantics at heart! This book is addictive. It grabs you by you heart and soul and mind and doesn't give you time to breath! At every page another layer of mystery is revealed and you fell sinking deeper and deeper into this world of enigmas. There is no escape! While you are reading it, you can not wait to reach its conclusion. Once you have finished, it leaves you intoxicated, wanting more, day dreaming about the characters and their stories.  I will definitely read it over and over again!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I was blown away by the new My Chemical Romance cd! It is awesome! I heard from a friend that the cd rocked so i just had ta check it out. I had never heard of My Chemical Romance before and im always into checkin out new bands so i went out and bought the cd for a reasonable price and i thought it was awesome! I really like their style of music and how My Chemical Roamce is very different from a lot of other bands out there now. I really enjoyed this cd and it is always in my computer playin while im surfing the internet or chilling out! I would really suggest this cd to anyone thats looking for a new favorite band and a new favorite cd to play all the time!
B00004YKUY|5.0|Without a shadow of a doubt, Steve Perry is the GREATEST Rock frontman in Rock-n-Roll History. Nobody could match his vocal abilities &amp; songwriting from the years of Infinity through Trial By Fire--and I'm very doubtful that FUTURE frontmen in Rock bands ever will. That right there should tell you something. BUT...the year is 2004. The band...still JOURNEY. Steve Augeri has held the mic since 1998. If you can't count, THAT'S OVER 6 YEARS, PEOPLE!! ARRIVAL is, in my opinion, the 3rd best showing of Journey music behind only FRONTIERS &amp; ESCAPE. AUGERI rips on the MIC, SCHON rips on the GUITAR, VALORY rips on the BASS, CAIN rips on the PIANO/KEYBOARD, and CASTRONOVO rips on the DRUMS. What more do you want on 1 CD besides more songs?<br />Steve Perry fans say STEVE PERRY. Greg Rolie fans says GREG ROLIE and yada-yada-yada. The following line sums up TRUE JOURNEY FANS: As long as Neal Schon is rippin' at that guitar...Journey can make as many changes to its line-up as it wants to...WHO CARES! JOURNEY has lasted 32 years (with and without Tickner, Dunbar, Fleischman, Rolie, Smith, Valory, Baird, Jackson and Perry) and I don't see them Titanic-ing any time soon. True, sales today compared to yester-year...NOT GOOD. But, why do artists have to sell millions of 1 CD before people mark the effort as GOOD, GREAT, EXCELLENT, SUPERB, whatever! This, and many efforts after this, will be just fine with this TRUE JOURNEY FAN!! Because I know what makes Journey JOURNEY...THE MUSIC, PEOPLE! So, in closing, re-read the title of my review!
0142004235|5.0|A fantasic novel with enough twists, turns, descent, heart ache and mental anguish to entrain even the average 21st Centruy reader.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Steinbeck and after completing \\"East of Eden\\" I truly believe that he is one of, if not the quintessential American author.  As accomplished as Hemmingway and Salinger are, Steinbeck has a gift for relating to the most common-place among us.  His descriptive talents are unmatched and his flair for the dramatic is remarkable.<br /><br />If you have a few days and are in the market for a fantastic novel by one of our contry's finest authors I must suggest \\"East of Eden.\\"
6305513406|3.0|I've already got the other sets. What's the holdup?
B0001ME5L2|5.0|If you like medium to hard rock, you'll love this CD.  Even when it's not playing, I can hear the songs in my head! Great music, great lyrics!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Watch it. If you have just graduated from a small highly competitive liberal arts college and you do not know what to do with your life, you will cry.
B000005J08|5.0|Despues de escuchar Mr. Bungle compre este disco, Zorn esta realmente loco, si quieres oir una nueva alternativa en Jazz lo recomiendo a ojos cerrados, hay temas clasicos en los que el disco entrega una nueva alternativa, mucho mas excitante. Para entrar en el mundo de John Zorn es la mejor alternativa, ya que trae temas de otros discos, excelente.
B000148KK2|1.0|Diana does not have a great singing voice. She has a modest, almost shy personality. What has made her truly astonishing as a singer (much like Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughn, and Anita O'Day before her) has been her magical gift of PHRASING when she performed the jazz vocals. She also sang TOP material, whether written long ago or more recently, her songs were among the best. Topping that, she had amazing arrangers, world class orchestration and superb musicians around her.    Unfortunately, not on this album. Her songs are sub-standard and amateur, the phrasing and energy is only there for a couple of songs, and the \\"fire\\" is only luke-warm overall. The only advantage to this album is that the less-sophisticated ear may find it easier to understand musically. That shows good sales figures to Verve, who could not be happier... but musically, the fans of her previously glorious outings have shown this to be the overall low point for Krall as a musician. I agree. It is depressing, pedestrian and dull and she is capable of far greater. For that reason I can only give this one star.
0385333846|5.0|That the victims of the Dresden firebombing were, by and large, innocent<BR>bystanders caught in the cogs of a grisly machine called 'war' is irrefutable. <BR>That a man named Kurt Vonnegut was there, witnessed it from the ground-level<BR>(and below), and carried the psychological burden of it around with him for<BR>years is obvious.  That he was able to write such a brilliant book on such a<BR>dark subject is, quite frankly, amazing.<br />On the surface, `Slaughterhouse-Five' deals with the trials and tribulations of<BR>one Billy Pilgrim, ophthalmologist and erstwhile WWII chaplain's assistant,<BR>whose life is apparently filled with more death and destruction than his mind<BR>has the capacity for.  At least, that's what his daughter thinks when Billy<BR>starts behaving erratically.  Little does she know that he has become unstuck<BR>in time, experiencing his life in a random, non-linear fashion forever.  Since<BR>Billy has no way of knowing what will come next, all he can do is enjoy the<BR>good moments when they come, and deal with the bad as best he can.<BR>Who can make sense of a life like that?<br />And in a larger sense Mr. Vonnegut asks us, who can make sense of a world where<BR>people blow each other to bits for arbitrary reasons?  What is there to say? <BR>It really is for the birds: poo-tee-weet.<br />Truly a masterpiece of 20th-century literature.  Should be required reading for<BR>every high-school student.
B000002HH9|2.0|If Robert Smith were having such wild mood swings, he probably should've taken some estrogen, or something.  He's getting older.  Menopause isn't such a far away thing for him.  If he'd take some vitamins, maybe he wouldn't have had such bad mood swings, and this would've been okay...  Haha.  Menopause...  <br />the only reason this got two stars is because, first of all, the Cure had the balls to actually put this out.  Secondly, because I like one of the songs on here.  I think it's the first one...  but it's not that impressive, really.<br />Honestly, what this reminded me of was a very, very, very horrible case of schizophrenia.  I like weird people, but this was extreme.<br />Otherwise, this just sucks.  I squirmed when I listened to this.  And I said, &quot;Why! Oh god, why!?&quot;  Yeah... so if you think you may like the cure... but you're not for sure DON'T BUY THIS!  go buy Seventeen Seconds, an absolutely genius album.  Or disintegration, because everyone will tell you to buy it.  Seventeen Seconds is good, too.  Wild Mood Swings isn't. eww.
0156027321|3.0|I enjoyed the book however i actually expected more. Most people LOVE it and i just didn't. I liked it but didn't LOVE it. Some people apparently like that there's a question in the end about whether or not all the events in the book really happen the way the story was told. However the book did keep my interest so i would recommend it.
B000066HI4|5.0|Will (Bonnie &quot;Prince&quot; Billy) Oldham is amazing!  Don't be swayed by the close minded folks who have reviewed some of his other albums, &quot;Eww, he has a beard and he's balding!  Oh no, this is weird!&quot;  Those are the same folks who rag on Tom Waits, &quot;I just can't get past his voice!  It's too gravelly!  That's not singing!&quot;.  Will Oldham is great.  Buy this album and really listen to it, you won't be disappointed
B000024D4R|5.0|This is a must have for every Pink Floyd fan. Heck, every music fan. This album, while it's not as epic as Dark Side of the Moon, it's just a great album.<BR>    While this album was made in the period I like to call &quot;Water's downfall&quot;, it still has enough influence from the earlier albums to make it good. <BR>    This is the missing link between Wish You Were Here and The Wall, which is the only reason it was so good; it starts to show resemblance of the style of The Wall, which, in my opinion, is a stinker.<BR>    But Animals definately is not for the casual listener. It's more of an aquired taste. It reflects Pink's opinions more than other albums, but, maybe it's only because they do it more openly than their others. Especially the song &quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot; <BR>    And, for anyone who likes Heavy Metal, the song &quot;Sheep&quot; has a little bit of a Heavy Metal sound to it. <BR>    Overall, this is a great album. I would definately recommend this to any music fan, especially those that are Pink.
B00000C3G6|5.0|Finally, after eons out of print, Atlantic made available again this gem from the early 70's, a great album even in the context of the great music that was still being created, regularly, back then, and probably one of Crosby &amp; Nash's most accomplished collaborations.<br />Everything you likely already cherish about these two is present here, heartfelt and immaculate harmonies, strong and distinct compositions from both artists, and superb musicianship -again provided by the 60's elite of California's session players.<br />When it comes to specific songs, it's more a matter of personal choices than objective hierarchies. Nash's songs are particularly moving and fiercer -as much as &quot;fierce&quot; is ever something to be said about Graham Nash- than anything in &quot;Songs For Beginners.&quot; Crosby's pieces carry the wonderful dramatic undertow he could invoke -it seems, at will- ever since The Byrds' days and, more poignantly, in his first solo album and Deja Vu.<br />All in all, a thing of beauty. No disappointments, no proverbial &quot;black holes.&quot;<br />An example of the significant music that you could still expect in the early seventies, before that decade turned grandiose and stupid.
B000002GJH|5.0|This CD is a bit underground but definately a classic. Even if you don't like 'grunge' this CD still works. It's got a touch of emotion that is often lacking in SG. The melodies are beautiful, the lyrics match. This CD is better than most, if not all, PJ and SG CDs. It's just magical. Suggested tracks: All Night Long, Wooden Jesus, Say Hello 2 Heaven, Call Me a Dog. Solo fans will also like Reach Down. DO NOT BASE THE WHOLE CD ON HUNGER STRIKE! It's no where near the best song on here, it's one of my least favorites. It's practically the only song with Eddie. Actually, I think it the only song with him. Either way, in general, good CD to have.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is a terrific first album from this group. I heard them live yesterday at an in-store performance and later at a club. And they were terrific both times. They do deserve their name of &quot;the new Coldplay&quot;. The keyboard support is terrific. That's it - keyboard, drums and a good voice. Nice band! They will get huge no doubt.<br />If you love Coldplay, you are likely to love these 3 English chaps. You can listen to their songs at keaneband.com.<br />Enjoy it!
B00005JMKI|5.0|1.If anyone has prompted you to see this movie...just see it.  Most recommendations are suggested because there was a signifigant impact from a 3+ hour film.  I promise it will not feel like Titanic or Braveheart, where the plot was easy and simple enough for a child.  It will leave you speeechless and your brain dizzy yet fullfilled with understanding.<br />2.This film is not anti-American.  It was released in Europe in late april, but for some reason (the war) was not released in the U.S.  Now, this October it will only be seen by a small percentage and unnecessarily deemed a horrible film, by American audiences, not by its film critics.<br />3.Dogville is part 1 to a trilogy entitle: Red White and Blue.  This is very exciting for the people who saw and adored the film.  In each part, Nicole Kidman's character will learn many lessons in various situations.  It is a way to describe her endurance againt human behavior to survive.<br />I must say that i loved Dancer in the Dark.  This film is on the same level, taking you directly to the chareacters predicament.  Dogville's lack of film set is its most successful detail, allowing the viewer to get involved with the characters and not the scenery. From chapter 1 to chapter 20-something, your preferences will change from character to character. Be aware that not everyone is as sincere as they seem.<br />Please see this film with empty bladders or with a planned intermission. The effort is great on the viewer's part, but its reward is so worth it.<br />And for those fellow reviewers...Please don't give the plot away.  This film should only be seen if one can fully experience a cinematic masterpiece without the expensive advertising trailers.  This film should stay \\"word of mouth.\\"
B000092T6M|3.0|The movie is o.k.,except for Alan Rickman!!  This man is so good in evil roles!!  I just watch it to only see him!!  It's one of those movies where you watch if you are bored and don't have nothing to do.  If the movie did not have Alan Rickman, I would only rate it two stars!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I loved this cd for I can realy relate to what she is taking about. The only problem I had was there was a little bit of cussing otherwise. This is a awsome cd for any bodys collection.<br />punk christians rule<br />Jesus loves you
0790729709|1.0|Its sad that a movie like this that contains no script or story plot is labeled a great movie and is given better reviews than Mariah Carey's Glitter which contained a story and plot.<br />Come on just think about it. I love Whitney as a singer though.<br />Visit my site: [...]
B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\"  a couple weeks aho while listening to Virgin Radio UK on iTunes. It totally rocked, so I listened to samples of the rest of the album and eventually bought it. Not a track that I don't like! Very diverse from song to song. The lyrics to \\"Somebody Told Me\\" crack me up every time I hear the song: \\"Somebody told me you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year, it's not confidential, I've got potential...\\"<br />If you like indie rock with a classic rock influence, these guys are a great find. Take it with you in the car, crank it up, put down the windows, and you'll have the ultimate soundtrack for the summer!
B000002BVN|5.0|As Michael Jackson's 6th solo album, the highly anticipated album sure didn't dissapoint. <br />The album shows evolution and how he has transformed his artistic ability. Each track is unique in its own right. As the biggest selling remix album of all time with 11 million copies sold, the album has much to offer. Remix albums historically don't sell well, but this was marked down as the most successful remix album in history. <br />The album offered 5 new tracks and remixes from his the previous album in 1995, History Past Present and Future, which sold well over 21 million copies. <br />Most of the remixes on this album are great, a few are poor. The five tracks are unbelievable and outstanding. <br />The new tracks show his new genre as he changes within every album.<br />Here is a review for the entire tracklisting:<br />Blood On The Dancefloor: Wow! Great track. The lyrics are haunting and very shocking. I love it!<br />Morphine: The dark side of Michael Jackson as he opens up honestly about his painkiller addiction in 94'.<br />Superfly Sister: Great R&B track. A true highlight of the album. It reminds you of his 1980's work.<br />Ghosts: I love the song. The chorus is very catchy and contains meaningful lyrics: \\"Who gave you the right to shake my family tree....are you the ghost of jealousy\\". It is a clear attack on the evil Tom Sneddon who is getting people to extort money from Michael Jackson who is innocent of all allegations!<br />Is It Scary: Similar to Ghosts, but this version is more enjoyable.<br />Remixes are great. The best and most unique remix was the remix for Stranger In Moscow and History.<br />This is worth every penny. The first five tracks are worth the purchase alone. I love this album and you must have it for your collection if you know true music!<br />(...)
B0001CNRSE|4.0|i loved this movie.  it combined the hip-hop flava with the ghetto.  i love dance movies, and i think you have to, to enjoy this movie.  the dance scenes were incredible with some hot new moves.  the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars is because i didn't like how it ended, i wanted to see that director get what he deserved and honey cheorograph missy elliot's routine.  that woulda been hott to watch.  this was a great dance movie, but save the last dance still holds it's spot as the best dance movie of all time.  i also feel that this movie coulda had a little more romance between honey and the baller, chaz, it woulda made it sexier.
0553382179|5.0|Yeah, I know someone else already used that title but it is true.  This is truly the BEST organizational book ever written!  I have 2 copies one to lend out and one that stays in my nightstand (for refresher readings). I will give one of these books to each of my kids when they move out/get married.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I've been a SlipknoT fan since 1999, and I heard alot of talk surrounding SlipknoT's new record Vol.3:(The Subliminal Verses). For the final 2 or 3 months of recording, everybody was saying that its slipknot's best work to date, its something completely unexpected and will surprise many people who are slipknot fans and who are not familiar with slipknot, and that it could very well be a classic record. Hearing all these things being said about the new slipknot album got me more anxious to buy this record once it would hit stores. I saw the video for &quot;Duality&quot; and I was excited to I was amazed and excited. It wasn't as brutal and aggressive as alot of slipknot's older songs from there first 2 records, but the main thing that was recognizable was that the band did not sound like they were just making loud heavy and out tune music. They all sounded like they were doing the song together and not seperately like they did on there first two records which in my mind are great records. Finally May 25th arrived and I went out to buy Vol.3: (The Subliminal Verses). I took it home put it in my stereo and waited for utter anialation. The first track got me a little nervous, cause it wasn't really heavy and brutal, and I began to think that maybe it was nothing but hype. But that all changed when &quot;The Blister Exists&quot; came on. The acustic songs were ok. In my opinion the best songs on this record are &quot;The Blister Exists&quot; &quot;Three Nil&quot; &quot;Duality&quot; &quot;Welcome&quot; &quot;Vermilion&quot; &quot;Pulse Of The Maggots&quot; and &quot;The Virus Of Life&quot;. I love this record. I believe Vol.3: (The Subliminal Verses) is a classic record and possibly the best record of 2004, and one of the best metal records to come out in years. Vol.3: (The Subliminal Verses) sold between 250,000 and 300,000 records in its first week of release last month to land at the #2 spot on the billboard top 100 album chart. You will definately enjoy SlipknoT's new record Vol.3: (The Subliminal Verses).

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is filmmaking at its height and glory. Instead of repeating what has already been said in the other reviews, I'd like to quote a passage given in the DVD case by &quot;Ain't it Cool News&quot;:<br />&quot;This film should be REQUIRED VIEWING for every friggin High School kid in the country. It should be unleased upon them. This movie is brutal...brutal in the most aggressively harsh reality moments we have in society. Are you happy with where the characters are at the end...NO....should it be any different...NO. This film has an absolute moral center. And I know for a fact that I'll see this film at least 10 times before the end of the year. Not because it is a happy film. Not because ewwww I love dark stories. I'll see it repeatedly because it is just BRILLIANT filmmaking.&quot;<br />I myself have a new standard as far as a lead actress is concerned...Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb. It takes alot to make me cry in a movie, but I have never helt so intensly about a characters demise than in Requiem. She is the actress to which all other actresses will be compared. <br />I can't stress enough how important this movie is to see, and how important it is to spread. Amazing...simply extraordinary.
B000003TA4|5.0|This cd is perfect.Every song on here is 100% perfection.R.I.P. Kurt Cobain...who will be remembered as a legend.
B00005JKN9|3.0|The only reason I've given this outrageously over-blown marathon  3 stars is because Daniel Day-Lewis delivers the performance of his career as Bill The Butcher. Opening promisingly enough with an extraordinary battle sequence, the film quickly(&amp; I mean quickly)descends into an exercise in sheer tedium. I can't imagine any period piece that would suit Cameron Diaz, &amp; I don't know what Scorcese was thinking when he cast DiCaprio. The reason I  titled this review disappointing is because I've long been a fan of Scorcese's work. Goodfellas, Mean Streets &amp; Raging Bull..ingenious!!! Even Casino had it's high points. I can't help feeling a lttle sympathy for this director since Gangs represents a long cherished labour of love. To be fair, I find it interesting to ponder on what kind of film it would have been had it been edited by an hour.  Unfortunately, this should be filed alongside his Cape Fear as utterly unnecessary....
B000002KIE|5.0|This has got to be one of my most favoraite CDs.Johnny Rotten's voice is amazing.His voice is off key,but it's exactly what makes it amazing.The best songs on there would have to be &quot;Bodies&quot;,&quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot;,&quot;God Save the Queen&quot;,&quot;No feelings&quot;,&quot;EMI&quot;...actually this whole album is great,but those are just some of my personal favoraites.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I was very surprised with this album, I am very critical of marillion if I have to be, but this time things are quite<BR>different, along with Tempano's &quot; the agony and the ecstasy&quot; this is one of my top five in the last 3 years.<BR>A must have !

B00005JMEW|4.0|Nice movie...great and the end makes you stay in suspense.Very simple,but still great.I think Quentin Tarantino has a thing for Uma Thurman and her feet (Watch this AND &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;,and try to tell me he doesn't) Very gory and violent,but still good.
1573225517|5.0|There's a great passage in High Fidelity where Rob talks about all of the sad songs about broken hearts he has listened to in his life. He's listened to them over and over thousands of times, and he wonders if he likes them because he's so miserable or if he's so miserable because he has listened to those songs. When I read the passage, I just about died laughing. I've asked the same question of myself, only substituting books for songs. <br />In a way, High Fidelity is a great book because of what this passage is talking about, though. It's a novel written about a loser for losers (like me) to read. Rob is a sad and miserable thirty-five year old who refuses to grow up, and we can relate. I could, at least. Nick Hornby knows who his audience is. His audience is people who have been through spoiled by the society in which they've been raised and haven't yet learned how to actually live. Rob is this person and he ultimately begins to grow up, and he gives all losers some hope. High Fidelity is an engaging, funny, and pretty wise novel that a lot of people can relate to.
B000066NW0|1.0|This cd sucks.I unfortunatly,listened to this cd.I borrowed a bunch of my friend's CDs and this was one of them.It was horrible.She says she's not Britney,and she's right.Britney's better..and that's a LOT to say considering I don't like Britney's music,either.The only half way decent song is &quot;Complicated&quot;...and ironically it's about a person who isn't themselves...hmm sounds familiar.
B000294SFW|5.0|If you ever had the notion that the Motor Train would ever slow down you will be happy to be mistaken. This could be there heaviest album to date. While heavy, still melodic and well written. Lemmy's lyrics sometime get lost in the hardness of the tunes. His sense of poetry is the without a dought the best today. The only ohter rocker to write with his passion was Philip Lynott. Enjoy this instant Motorbanger classic.

B000075BFK|4.0|It won't go down in history as the next \\"All Eyez On Me\\", but 2Pac's latest posthumous gem is close to a classic in my opinion....with a few flaws. For instance, the album (two disc) is bogged down by one too many cameos (don't the Outlawz have dayjobs or something?) and some misplaced collabos (we know there's no way in heck Pac would ever hook up with Nas). Nevertheless, Pac's balance between his hardcore and soulful lyrics, fused with bangin', addictive (yet slightly glossy) beats, and sprinkled with clues of his imminent return makes this package required listening for even the casual Pac fanatic. Suge Knight actually did some justice to the late, great veteran, and hip-hop purists will be satisfied with the inclusion of some G-Funk production.<br /><br /> Word of advice: Don't even touch the edited version; they completely screwed that up<br /><br />------------------------8 out of 10-----------------------------<br /><br />Best Songs<br /><br />-\\"Still Ballin'\\"<br /><br />-\\"When We Ride On Our Enemies\\"<br /><br />-\\"Thugz Mansion (7 Remix w/ Anthony Hamilton)\\"<br /><br />-\\"Better Dayz\\"<br /><br />-F*** 'Em All\\"<br /><br />-\\"My Block (Remix)\\"<br /><br />Worst Songs<br /><br />-\\"There U Go\\"<br /><br />-\\"Military Minds\\" (Pac only gets 1 verse, then gets drowned out)<br /><br />-\\"Fair Xchange\\" (too raunchy for my taste)

0312263120|4.0|I know some people probably didn't care much for this Dan Brown book, but it was at least a cyberpunk sci-fi, which I also like just not as much as sci-fi space opera like: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others. But this particular Dan Brown book, like a couple of others, are definitely worth a read by sci-fi lovers and, especially, cyberpunk lovers.
B00005KHJR|5.0|Last week I had the chance to sit down and watch this truly excellent movie.  The Wicker Man stars Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland.  I was expecting a sort-of cheap gothic horror film (after all, Christopher Lee is in it) but I got something much better.<br />Edward Woodward plays a policeman from the Highland Police who has flown to the island of Summerisle to investigate a report of a missing girl.  After discovering that just setting foot on the island is an adventure, Woodward is unable to find anyone who knows the girl who is missing.  Even the girl's mother doesn't know who she is.  A right puzzler.  Forced to stay on the island, Woodward takes a room at the local tavern.  Amidst the bawdy songs and lively music he begins to realize that the island folk are not quite what he is used to.<br />As his investigation takes him further along Woodward begins to suspect that the island is populated by sinners.  By his definition he is right.  The local population reverted back to their old religion during the early Victorian Era.  They are now firmly entrenched in their old beliefs.  To top it off it just happens to be May Day.  Unable to drop the case, Woodward finds traces of the girl.  He suspects that she is alive but captive and a soon-to-be sacrifice to restore the harvest.  Woodward infiltrates the May Day celebration disguised as Punch.  Then, at a crucial moment, he manages to grab the girl and flee.  Then he learns the real truth.<br />From the opening credits showing the Scottish Isles and their sapphire waters and the accompanying Celtic music this movie is anything but a cheap horror film.  Woodward plays the epitome of the Christian and the Authoritarian.  Armored only with his belief in his god he must face a setting that, to him, is completely evil.  Young girls being taught the significance of the maypole, naked women jumping through fire to help fertility, march hares in caskets and dozens of other examples.  But it is Woodward whois the strange one.  The people look at him as they would a simpleton.  But Woodward, knowing that god and country are behind him, manages to keep going right to the conclusion of the film.<br />This classic confrontation of Christian against Pagan is so well done, framed by modern settings and Celtic music, that I can hardly say how good it is.  Woodward's performance rivals his role in Breaker Morant and the young Christopher Lee's talent shows through so clearly that it is obvious why he was cast in so many roles.  The story was written by the same man who brought us Hitchcock's Frenzy as well as the mystery Sleuth.  If you have not seen this 1973 film, I urge you to do so.
0553293397|5.0|As should be anyone even slightly fascinated by sci-fi and space opera. And very few people can deliver like Asimov, with the exception of Arthur C. Clarke and Robert A. Heinlein. I would urge all sci-fi addicts to get this book as well as: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others.
0783225547|3.0|Ever since seeing the preview, I have wanted to see Dante's Peak.  While waiting for it to be released, a second film called Volcano suddenly popped up.  Dante's Peak had Pierce Brosnan (playing a character named Dalton) and Volcano had Tommy Lee Jones.  Peak also had the creative talents of Michael Crichton.  Volcano had none.  But, having finally seen Dante's Peak I have to say that Volcano was the better movie.<br />Brosnan is part of a national team that keeps an eye on volcanic activity.  He is sent to the town of Dante's Peak to see if there is reason for further testing.  He goes, he looks and he becomes convinced that the sleeping volcano will blow sometime soon.  Unfortunately he has no real evidence.  The rest of the team arrives and they can find no justifiable evidence.  Guess what?  Brosnan is right and the volcano blows.  There is a rather amusing scene where in order to survive the shockwave, Brosnan and the town's mayor must seek shelter in some unstable mines (an idea that only works when the alternative is certain death).  In the end there is no town but almost no casualties thanks to Brosnan and the rest of the team.<br />The scenes with the volcano erupting were quite spectacular but they were not enough to carry the film.  It is an almost intellectual endeavor as opposed to the pulse-pounding of Crichton's previous film Twister.  Obviously meant to ride the wave of Twister's success, Dante's Peak fails to make the grade.  In Twister we cared about the research team and their work.  In Peak all we are concerned with is how soon everyone will be convinced the volcano is unstable.  Plus, several twisters buoy up a film better than one volcano (unless handled as it was in Volcano).  So go ahead and see Dante's Peak if you want but you will probably agree that there is something just not right.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I never liked Brad Pitt in his movies, so when my neighbor told me to watch it, I was hesitant. I thought it was going to be really dumb. I watched it anyway and have found a great movie! Brad Pitt was awesome! I couldn't believe it. This movie is worth it's weight in gold. (or at least the 12-20 bucks most places are asking for it!) If you haven't seen this you have got to! The lines are perfect, they all fit together, and there is enough comedy, romance, mystery, etc ,etc to keep it from being too sad. In the end, it is happy so for those of you who don't like sad movies - DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS ONE, IT IS GREAT!
0790733226|3.0|Contact is a movie based on the book of the same name by Carl Sagan. Well the title, opening and ending are the same but most of the rest is new. As a film it was o-kay but as an adaptation it was pretty bad.<br />Radio telescopes pick up a signal from space. The signal has many levels and originates from a system that has been too quiet. In the signal there appears to be the instructions for building some sort of machine. The machine is built and sabotaged. A second machine is activated and the movie's star has an experience unobserved from Earth.<br />It is common to shrink casts to make a book fit in a movie. In this case it lengthened it. By cutting the team down to one person there was suddenly a lot of politics about what single person could represent all of Earth. After the return it is one person's word, not a team's, against the evidence.<br />I was not a big fan of the book when it came out (the characters jumped to too many conclusions and I didn't like the ending). The film 2001: A Space Odyssey becomes the template for the journey with language lifted right from the novelization (of 2001, that is) thus weakening the story even further.<br />One way to think of it is that if this film mated with Independence Day then the offspring would be The Arrival. While The Arrival does the contact bit better Contact is still fun to watch. Tom Skerrit makes an excellent low-key bad guy. This is an unfortunate way to remember Carl Sagan the man.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Where do you begin with a film that is as beautiful, poetic, moving, powerful, substantial, grounding, uplifting, and definitively sublime as The Straight Story.  From it's emotionally and technically pitch perfect score by Angelo Badalamenti to the brilliant direction of David Lynch, the film takes us on a journey we will never forget.<br />Despite everything I've offered, the film depends upon one man- Richard Farnsworth.  In his last role, his award-winning performance is a master class in listening and being.  He IS Alvin Straight instead of acting like Alvin Straight.  His beautiful blue eyes are weary with pain and memories.  I have never seen the eyes convey so very much.  To watch his scene at the bar and not have a resounding physical reaction- well, there may be no help for your soul.<br />Simply put, allow yourself the priviledge of viewing The Straight Story.
0767805712|4.0|Gattaca paints a future where the haves are genetically designed and the have-nots are genetically inferior with no hope of advancement.  But one young man has a dream.  He wants to get into space.  To do this he works out and studies as hard as he is able.  But all of the hard work does no good.  Then he finds a way.<br />Occasionally one of the haves has an accident.  Then it is possible to assume that person's identity armed with genetic traces, blood and urine samples and some creative surgery.  Thus armed he is able to enter Gattaca (the organization responsible for space flight) where he wins a position on the mission to Titan.  But there is a hitch; a murder.  During the investigative sweep one of his eyelashes is found and the search begins in earnest.<br />Most of the rest of the movie is involved with trying to maintain identity long enough to manage take off.  Complicating matters are a Columbo-style detective (Alan Arkin), a love interest (Uma Thurman) and his brother from his old life.  In the end it comes down to a simple idea.  Many of the haves know a have-not (be it a child, sibling or whatever) who they have had to abandon and our hero represents the one ray of hope that these people can have.  So just as he is discovered, the discoverers each have a reason to not turn him in and he begins the mission to Titan.<br />Gattaca, with its heavy detective cat-and-mouse, could be the successor to Alfred Bester's THE DEMOLISHED MAN.  This was a very well made film with a good story, characters, acting and pacing.  There were excellent performances from many of the cast including author Gore Vidal.  If you like your films with a bit of thought then this is one you should look out for.
6300275213|5.0|I just watched Splash over the weekend on video, for the umpteenth time and I have to say is one of my all time favourite comedies. It still has me laughing out loud and makes me want to weep over the romantic scenes.<br />A young Tom Hanks plays Allen Bauer, a fruit wholesaler who has just been dumped by his girlfriend. He goes off to Cape Cod one evening after getting drunk and is rescued by a naked beautiful girl (Daryl Hannah) when he falls into the sea. The naked beautiful girl later arrives in New York at the Statue of Liberty in search of Allen whom  she also saved from drowning many years ago when they were children. Allen immediately falls for her and spends the happiest days of his life steaming up his appartment and seeing the sights of New York. The only problem is the naked beautiful girl (now named Madison) is in fact a mermaid but Allen doesn't know this.<br />She has six whole days to stay with Allen and then she must return to the sea. Allen thinks that Madison is an illegal immigrant and offers to marry her so that she can stay with him. She refuses at first and then accepts his offer but before she can tell him her big secret she is exposed to the whole world by a scientist (Eugene Levy) that she is a mermaid. Allen is shocked and backs away from Madison but later realises his mistake and with his brother (John Candy) and the help of Eugene Levy they save her from imprisonment by the scientists.<br />John Candy who plays Allen's playboy brother is absolutely hilarious. His character is literally larger than life. The comic timing between Tom Hanks and John Candy is spot on. Daryl Hannah is also great as the mermaid who learns to be human in literally a few days. There are some brilliant laugh out loud scenes such as when Daryl Hannah is at Bloomingdales watching television for 6 hours to educate herself in the English language and when she's in a restaurant eating lobster including the shell. There are some great lines aswell such as when Allen mentions about getting married and having children and Madison innocently asks what kind.<br />Splash is a timeless comedy and is highly recommended to all those who love a bit of romance along with a good laugh.<br />Lealingn mentions about getting married and having children and Madison innocently asks what kind. <br />Splash is a timeless comedy and is highly recommended to all those who love a bit of romance along with a good laugh. <br />Lealing

B0000028RR|5.0|This album is incredible.  Tom Morello is pheraps one of the greatest guitarists ever.  Ever.  No synthesisers.  Insane.  Reading the reviews about people who liked the album, and people who didn't, the people who didn't often cited &quot;white boy&quot; politics and some reviewrs called them liberal propaganda or something.  I don't know I dont really pay attention 'cuase I can tell when it is an actual competent adult or a 9 year old whoes daddie's in the NRA.  Yea.  Tom Morello is so awesome.
0374172897|4.0|...as some people think. I read this book in about two days, and to tell you the truth, I didn't feel 'depressed' because of it. I really didn't feel much sympathy for any of the characters, because when I was reading the book, I was thinking about how much more right I had to be depressed instead of these characters.  But, I still see how they could feel like that. After all, who am I to decide who should and shouldn't be depressed? As another reviewer said, depression can get to anyone, but for someone like me, I doubt these characters' problems will seem significant enough to call this a 'depressing' or 'life-changing' novel.<br /><br />Now, to the writing. I think it was greatly done, although I liked his style in 'A Home at the End of the World' a bit better for some reason. (Still have to read 'Flesh and Blood'.) Michael Cunningham is for sure one of the better writers around. As for the movie based on this novel, I watched it before I read it, and thought it was beautifully done.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think this novel is worth reading, but I highly doubt that people who've been through far more crap than these characters will really relate to them.<br /><br />-Ater
B00006RU5B|5.0|I struggle to write a review without saying &quot;bad&quot; things about the other reviewers, and hence most of my reviewers never get posted.  Kinda sucks.  So I'm not going to say anything.  THIS GROUP IS AWESOME.  Tom Morello and the dude from audio slave... damn what a mix.  Its really a diffirent compliment to Morello's guitar than RATM is.  Totally diffirent sound.  Can't even be compared.  As for the &quot;supergroup&quot; label... yea they live up to it.  Moreso than velvet revolver has, and VR is also pretty insane.<br />This had best get posted

B0001LJC2K|5.0|I have a question for all of the comparers to Radiohead.  Are you REALLY listening closely to these records?  Go back and listen again.  Matt Belamy does not sound like Thom Yorke.  They both use falsetto yes, but Belamy has a deeper midrange to his voice that allows him more volume and range than Mr. Yorke.  As far as the music goes, there is no comparison.  Radiohead has never rocked as hard as Stockholm Syndrome, even in the Pablo Honey days.  The guitar tones are more shrill here, and in-your-face.  People also forget that Matt Belamy is an excellent pianist.  Listen to his uses of this beautiful instrument throughout this record, and tell me when Radiohead pulled this off so well.  These are two different bands people.  You are comparing apples to oranges.  Muse is the best band in the world right now.  I am a huge Manic Street Preachers fan, and they are to drop a new record this year, and it had better be the best thing they have ever done to compare with this.  I am looking forward to seeing Muse on the Curiosa festival this summer, and I am sure that they will not dissapoint.  I will close by saying LISTEN TO THIS RECORD!!!   Really LISTEN!  I truly believe that if you focus on the talent and uses of textures and timbres, and the terriffic writing here, you will have a totally different experience from any Radiohead listening session.  BTW, I should mention that I am a Radiohead fan too, just up to OK Computer.  They lost me with the electro bedwetter stuff.  I'm out.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot has really shown how awsome they are in this album. Slipknot shows just how hard they are in the song Welcome. The two songs Circle and Vermilion,Pt.2 shows how beautiful this album is. This is the best album slipknot has come out with and you would be crazy not to get this disc.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This project is an exhilarating meditation on the nature of reality.  Linklater, in my opinion, succeeds remarkably well in mimicking the experience of lucid dreaming with his use of photomontage, cartoon overlays and jerky camera movements. The dialogues and characters in the movie possess a ghost-like quality that lured my unsuspecting mind into the murmurs of incandescent unpredictability, so typical of dreaming....and the creative process.<br />What underlies all the philosophising, the analysing and reviewing in Waking Life is passion for experience of life mixed with unease and wonder that one has in the face of the unknown.  There are no subterfuges, no tricks, no gimmics, no questions even - only the wide open eyes of a young man watching, observing and experiencing. This is an awesome movie and I intend to watch it many more times.
1558216847|2.0|This book purports to describe the travels of a polish<BR>officer in 1942 escaping from Siberia across China and<BR>into freedom in India.  As a travel book, it doesn't<BR>hold up.  As anyone who has travelled to these areas can<BR>tell you, no small unsupported group of people is going<BR>to just walk across those deserts without water or cross through<BR>Tibet north to south during the coldest months of the year.<BR>There are no landmarks to speak of presented in the book that<BR>in any way line up to the geography of where he claims to have<BR>gone. Beyond that, his story of escape from the russian camp is pure unbelievable melodrama.

B000002NIW|5.0|This album is simple sheer brilliance, from the start to finish! A lot of people bad mouth the whole nu-metal scene claiming it to be commercial and badly written. The deftones are the band that show 'some people have no idea what they are talking about'. This album falls into the nu-metal genre quite comfortable, with tracks such as My Own Summer or Around The Fur and the overal song writting, it's clear that the deftones are one of the best bands in the world.<br />If you don't own this album, what are you waiting for, but it now!
B0000E1ALR|5.0|After reading all the comments by hardcore fans complaining about what should or shouldn't be on this set I have one thing to say to them: The first 2 CD's are not for you! Everbody has their own favorite Bruce songs. Pull out your couple dozen Springsteen cd's and burn your own 2,3 or 5 cd best-of set. This set is for the person who doesn't have all the albums and wants a simple 2 cd's of Bruce's best. Yes, it will have to contain Glory Days, Dancing In The Dark and Hungry Heart. Not my idea of his best work but these songs sell cd's. If you like some of the more serious songs on here go out and get Born To Run, The Wild The Innocent and Tunnel of Love and be truly inspired. And for the longtime listener who owns everything - Bruce has kindly included a bonus cd of great unreleased songs. So you have to pay $21 to get it? Not a big deal. You used to pay more for a bootleg not that many years ago. And you can give the first 2 cd's to your kids to teach them about good music.
B00005T5YK|5.0|Whats with the below review - This album wasn't about money, sure Neil Young was once quoted as saying what you wrote as you well know - think for yourself ya slimy maggot !<br /> Neil got it wrong, Neil is not wrong about much except that album he made with Pearl Jam.<br /> Rumours and Hotel California are two of the greatest albums of the 70's and now they're both available on Neil's favorite format DVD-A !! now we need Born to Run which is comin soon to SACD (which is basically the same thing soundwise less the visual content - photos, docos, lyrics).<br />Hotel California DVD-A - 5 out of 5<BR>The sound quality is amazing, alot of skill goes into revamping these recordings and top marks to the engineers ! <br /> Don't worry purists you still have the original 2 channel stereo mix included on this disc, but sit back and crank up the title track in 5.1 and you'll think this album was recorded yesterday and you're still in the studio having a smoke with Glen.
0151001634|5.0|I loved and enjoyed this book thouroghly (sorry if i misspell). The book is about this 32 year old guy named Charlie, he is retarted and struggling. He works at a bakery and has a bunch of friends at the bakery. He goes to a school for the retarted after work and got intrested in an experiment that could increase his I.Q. Will it work? You got to read the book to find out.<BR>  I read this book in a day and a half and couldn't put it down. It is very intresting having it written from Charlie's view and you get a little sense of what being retarted is like. It is an awesome book about hope, love, and learning.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Finally!! The Trilogy that began all trilogies is here. THE Star Wars Trilogy is the most influential series in History. Lucas created a Masterpiece of Since Fiction and Drama that is in a category all it's own. It is a classic tale of Good Vs Evil on a personal and universal Level. Since DVD format became mainstream this is the one that every collector has been beating down the Door to get. <BR>Lucas is a perfectionist and a few years ago he polished the Trilogy up and re-released it as the Special edition. Lucas has decided not to release the Theatrical Edition, causing much murmuring among some fans, but i see no problem here. If Anyone has ever created a work of Art and hung it on their own wall they know that over time you see mistakes and things you'd like to fix and I see it as the Artist right to do so. For those who still wish to see the theatrical edition , watch your VHS! That's about the picture and sound quality you got in the theater anyway.<BR>This will be a great set of DVD's Lucas will optimize sound and picture as only ILM can, making this a ceterpiece of home theater as it should be.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes are a great band and unique in this day. This album is solid from front to back, with great guitar rifts (Reptilia) to pop 80s style fun (12:51) to slow, melodic tunes (Under control). The rest in between are very catchy rock songs that flow nicely throughout the entire album. Easily one of the best of the year, with Elephant and Hail to the Thief as the other two. Can't imagine anyone criticizing this album.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I love SATC.  It's a great show.  Period.  It's a very mature and adult show.  Sometimes it can be graphic, but what do you expect with a title like Sex and the City?  It's right there in the title.  Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda are fabulous women with interesting stories.  They've all been through emotional hell just like the rest of us.  They deal with it in an adult way.  Carrie is my favorite.  she reminds me of me, which is another reason why SATC grabbed my attention.  I can totally relate to this hsow because I've gone through many of the things these characters have.  All in all, it's an excellent show and it's worth the money.
0380789035|4.0|I approached this book in a mood of some grouchiness. It had just won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards when I started reading it, and I was incensed. Another Joseph Campbell-esque piece of New-Agey balderdash masquerading (apparently successfully) as speculative fiction, I thought to meself.<br />And you know what? It's not that I was really even all that wrong...but the book is fantastic, regardless. Like most writers who cut their teeth on comic books (think Michael Chabon) Gaiman is better at short vignettes and set-pieces than he is at constructing a plot or drawing up particularly memorable characters. But this novel is so rich with vivid scenes and conversations and digressions that it's actually a quick read, even though by the end I wasn't entirely sure that it all added up to a whole lot.<br />I didn't even end up minding that the whole story was designed around the tired old &quot;the Gods only exist because we believe in them&quot; conceit. Because the gods that Gaiman thinks up really are magnificent creations. There's one scene where his protagonist has a conversation with the God that inhabits his television that still makes me shudder just to think about.
B000089CJI|5.0|great lyrics, great songwriting, I just wanted to give it a 5, I'd rather not write a whole review
B000050X31|5.0|I'm infuriated by that neo-Nazi racial bigot below who made such an utterly outrageous claim!!!!! Absolutely disgusting and downright shameful. Battle is a wonderful, wonderful Pamina, regardless of color of her skin! And she's a wonderful actress, his stupid remarks not withstanding. And contrary what,Mozart would be very, very pleased with her performance, as he would be with Serra, Hemm and Moll. Araiza is not very impressive here though. (...)
B00009XITQ|5.0|Miss Amanda Bynes is very photogenic and the camera loves her, she will be a superstar, and not just to teens, just wait till she turns 20 or so.  This dvd is interesting and although the plot has been done fefore, and it is abviously more a girls film, boys will also enjoy it, just to oogle at Amanda's long legs, especially when she wears mino skirts.  This is a fun fantasy film, for the whole family, and Miss Bynes sure shows a lot of charisma, and she is great, not really acting, but just being herself and having a ball.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|This movie was so cliche modern horror flicks that it was pathetic ... the special effects were pretty poor.  It had a great cast with really lousy dialogue.  After the first ten minutes, it's pretty much a waste of time and brain!  Don't bother renting this, let alone purchasing it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I really recommend this CD. It is really good I like every song on it. I am listening to it now. If you liked her first album you will love this one.I cant just listen to one song. The songs all are different so there is a variety. I really think it is worth buying.
B000089RVR|4.0|&quot;Life For Rent&quot; is absolutely a strong album that may communicate a more deeply personal expression than &quot;No Angel&quot;. The title track offers listeners a philosophical and somewhat whimsical reflection of the value of this life according to Dido's seemingly extensive experience. &quot;White Flag&quot; is a lovable song with a heavy message of conviction and emotion, and who can help but sing along? &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot; has a very catchy tune with lyrics that make listeners want to be where Dido is. A few of the songs have a moody, somber tone. Without having researched the story behind the lyrics, I imagine that a few of the songs were written in response to a period of mourning for a lost friend. &quot;See The Sun&quot; brought tears to my eyes as it outlined Dido's urging for her friend to feel &quot;lucky that [he] knew her at all&quot; (presumably, the &quot;her&quot; in question has passed away.)The combination of the music and the words in this song work together to elicit feelings of empathy and courage in its listeners. The ending music can be profitably compared to the end of Simon and Garfunkels &quot;The Boxer&quot;, which only adds to its authority and effectiveness. &quot;Do You Have A Little Time&quot; has a groovy tune that may find its listeners unconsciously swaying side to side, always an enjoyable side effect of good music.      <BR>   This album does not, in my estimation, have the same attraction that &quot;No Angel&quot; does. &quot;No Angel&quot; gave us the unforgettable &quot;Here With Me&quot;, the overplayed but eternally delightful &quot;Thank You&quot;, and the amazing bonus track &quot;Take My Hand&quot;, which still has the power to give me chills. Perhaps some of my bias toward &quot;No Angel&quot; lies in the fact that it was our introduction to the inimitible voice and charming style of the now famous Dido. <BR>   As a whole, &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is entirely worthwhile. Its message is thoughtful and refreshingly contemplative, and its music is memorable and beautiful. This album is another fine example of Dido's strength as a writer and a singer, offering us a solid reminder of the glory that was &quot;No Angel&quot; and an eager anticipation of her future albums.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought it by accident, and I was suprised with this movie. It was funny and smart and interesting. Even my girlfriend who does not like the sf did not allow me to watch the movie myself. It is like Bonanza, Star Wars and X-files together. Excellent characters- quite psychologically deep, really human souls, nothing white or black-like in life. Excellent ideas and even mix  spaceships and horses together looks quite OK. The only problem is that there is no season 2 and many things left unexplained. So if you know anybody from Fox: force him, beg him, bribe him to make season 2 (;-))
B000002AHM|5.0|You're joking right?!! Technical proficiency is not a sign of poor playing, you moron! The fact that each one of these incredibly talented musicians is able to PLAY WITH EACH OTHER is already saying so much about their abilities. If you actually gave the recording a good listen, which you obviously didn't, you would notice that the quiet, slow sections are just as beautiful, if not more so, than the lyrical, speedy sections. Frankly, if you were really a musician, or knew anything about music at all, you would realize that the mark of a great musician, is the ability to play softly, and slowly. You sound like a jaded Berklee student who is trying to find himself and is so insecure in your own inability to develop a sound you have to crap on other people. Oh and by the way...the pressence of arpeggios is included in only about 1/1,000,000 of the playing, most of the runs that Paco plays are augmented, but maybe you skipped that class at music school.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|A number of very loosely-connected love stories are woven together in this whimsical romantic comedy.  Hugh Grant plays his usual diffident, dithery character, a Prime Minister who falls in love with his somewhat improbably young and lovely tea lady (I don't know whether you have tea ladies in the States, but in England they tend to resemble Barbara Bush rather than Martine McCutchen).  The funniest scenes involve a very rude ageing rock star making a comeback, and his rather touching friendship with his manager.  Most of the men in the film are so diffident and hesitant they can't get anything done, they can't ask a girl out, or tell her they love her, or even switch off a mobile phone, in fact, they're a bunch of whimps.  Still, the film does have some funny moments, particularly when Hugh Grant goes in search of his tea lady and has to call on every house in the street to find out where she lives.  I would have prefered the film if it had more humour and less sentimentality (there are some scenes involving a widower and his cute young son that really pile on the pathos unrelentingly). It's not as funny as it might be, but it's not bad.
B00005K3LU|5.0|In 1988, a film was released that changed the face of action films forever. That film was &quot;Die Hard&quot;.<br />&quot;Die Hard&quot; is, quite simply, as good as an action film can be. Just what makes this movie so different from all the other generic rip-offs out there? &quot;Die Hard&quot; has just the right blend of witty, intelligent writing (yet still not forgetting the profanity), exquisite acting, intense plot twists, and just the right amount of bloody killing. And to top it off, all of this expertly directed at break-neck speed by John McTiernan.<br />This DVD gives the film a cleaner, newer look, keeping it looking fresh and exciting for the digital era. The sharper picture and sound maybe even add a little something.<br />After &quot;Die Hard&quot;, every action movie was just a wanna-be. They try to mimic what &quot;Die Hard&quot; managed, but never even come close. (This group of films even include the two sequels the film spawned.)<br />If you're looking for something fun, intense, intelligent, action-packed, and maybe even a little graphic, look no further than the legendary &quot;Die Hard&quot;.
B00004XPPC|5.0|David Lean's THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is certainly one of the great war epics of the cinema. It might be an even better film than his equally celebrated LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. The latter film has, at the center of all the visual grandeur and epic scale, a character than is equally larger-than-life. The main characters of BRIDGE, on the other hand, are more humanly scaled, and I was grateful for that. Here is a cinematic epic that isn't just empty spectacle, but has intriguing characters and a literate thoughtfulness that is becoming a rarity in movies these days. In a lesser film, for instance, characters like Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness, in a performance that won a deserved Academy Award---as did the movie itself), and Shears (William Holden) might have been reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes. Here, they have fascinating complexities that help drive the plot and serve its theme, which can pretty much be summed up by the final words of the movie: &quot;Madness, madness!&quot; The beauty here is that both Saito and Nicholson might be mad, but their madness isn't necessarily without justification.<br />Of course, all this character development, which may or may not necessarily be interesting by itself, serves as a backdrop for what is essentially an adventure on a grand scale, and on that level it also works triumphantly, delivering beautiful widescreen cinematography, lush settings, and genuine suspense, particularly in its tense final moments. A glorious epic adventure that also never skimps on the human element, indeed makes it almost an integral part of the story---that is the magic of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Highly recommended.
0312995423|5.0|Digital Fortress is a cyber thriller, and it's a good one, at that.<br />Ever since the conflict over accuracies and inaccuries in the DVC, it seems his other books have been approached unfairly on a fact vs. fiction basis.  In this case, Dan Brown isn't a software engineer - but he is an extremely talented writer.  Digitial Fortress is a very addicting read, with chapter's interwoven perfectly to keep the reader eager to constantly read through another new scenario to learn the resolution of the last.<br />Digitial Fortress won't disappoint anyone looking for a fun weekend novel.  Just don't go into the book expecting to find a computer manual!
B0000019PA|3.0|OK...  Most reviews I've seen of this CD are either wild exuberant praise (Magnet magazine even called this the #1 album of the 90's), or less than flattering (one I remember saying &quot;howling tunelessly over an acoustic guitar&quot;).  I guess it's one of those things where you either get it or you don't, and there's no middle ground - which is strange because I'm totally in the middle on this CD.  Sure, there's cool instrumentation (brass, organs, all the bells and whistles that other Elephant 6 bands like the Apples in Stereo and Olivia Tremor Control use) there are outstanding lyrics and Dylan-esque wordplay, and &quot;Holland 1945&quot; may have been the best song of 1998.  But there are shortcomings too, for example some songs just aren't very good.  There IS some &quot;tuneless howling&quot; here and there, &quot;Oh Comely&quot; drags on for what seems like forever, and the mix can be a bit too fuzzed out for pleasant listening.  I guess my personal tastes lean more to the poppier indie bands, while Neutral Milk Hotel is much less Beatles/Beach Boys influenced.  For you indie rock conneuiseurs, Mangum sounds quite a bit like the lead singer of Lotion (cool band).  Anyway, the bottom line is to definately buy this album if you are a fan of Elephant 6 bands, punky folk music, or like picking out amazing lines from song lyrics - avoid if you are a pop purist or into traditional vocals/song structure.<br />Best Tracks:<BR>&quot;The King Of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1&quot; - Nice lyrics on this one (naturally), the mix is a bit clearer on this one and Mangum's voice doesn't get too schizo.  A nice opener, quite Dylan to these ears.<BR>&quot;The Aeroplane Over The Sea&quot; - More of the same musically - acoustic led, but this song is a bit more direct lyrically.<BR>&quot;Holland 1945&quot; - Unbelievable.  Just read the lyrics, and imagine it set to a bouncy fuzz pop song.  Everyone who has heard this song around me says it sounds Irish, I can see where they get thatfrom, its very sing-alongy.<br />&quot;Communist Daughter&quot; - Less than 2 minutes of haunting acoustic folk.  Good follow after the genius &quot;Holland 1945&quot;.
B00005JMSE|3.0|I saw this movie a few months ago, around the time it came out, and was mostly entertained. It's definetly not a revolutionary film, but you can watch it without being bored out of your mind.<br />The plot is borderline ridicoulus. During WWII, a bunch of nazis get some sort of machine and try and release demons or something like that to kill their enemies. Out comes a little demon, who is later found by the \\"good guys\\", and named Hellboy. Hellboy is now part of an organization compiled of an old guy, an aqua man who looks more like an alien, and a few others, who work together to kill other menaces. Throughout the movie, Hellboy chases a girl with abnormal powers that she finds hard to deal with (X-Men, anyone?). The problem with the girl is, there's not enough time reflecting her. It's almost like, \\"Here's Hellboy, here's the girl Hellboy loves, she has problems.\\"<br />So, if you're looking for a great flick, you can skip this. The monsters are interesting at first, but you get kind of tired of the same old ones by the end of the movie. If you're looking for an entertaining flick, I guess this could do, but there's still better out there.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|&quot;Shrek&quot; is a groundbreaking animated film released in 2001.  It became the first film to win the Oscar for Best Animated Film.  This film is terrific for all ages to watch.  It features the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Oscar nominee John Lithgow (&quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;), and others.  It explores a journey of three outcasts (an orge, a talking donkey, and a princess with a secret) to attempt to rescue villagers from being forced out of their homes.  The villagers have a twist.  All of them come from famous fairy tales, including the seven dwarves, Pinnocio, Cinderella, and many others.  The quest becomes more than just mission.  The three characters find their true selves and reveal secrets that change their lives forever.  The action sequences contain the entertainment to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.  Some action scenes have a little humor, namely tributing to &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  Every scene throughout the film has its own different theme that keeps audiences entertained, including comedy, action, and romance.  As with the plot, the actors offer their own sense of theme that adds to the thrills.  The wide range of personalities keep audiences interested.  &quot;Shrek&quot; is great film sure to please audiences everywhere.  Fans should also watch &quot;Shrek 2&quot; as the two combined make a great viewing experience.
076790592X|5.0|it is really amazing!As a teen, reading this kind of self-help book is beneficial. This bk was actually recommended by my friend. After reading, I really appreciate and wanna give her a BIG THANKS!!<BR>I especially love the chapters about death and money. Very good interpretation and inspiring. I immediately lent my bk to my other friends. n' they love it too.<BR>I highly recommend this Bk* :]

B0001UL7RY|3.0|In interviews, Ms. Lavigne appears to have no brain.  However, she has a knack for catchy songs and melodies.  Her lyrics aren't exactly brilliant, but who cares?  This album is entertaining and that's all Avril is good for.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This cd ROCKS if your an old fan or a new fan. The first time I listened to it I was blown away. The I heard Before I Forget and I haven't taken the cd out since I got which was two weeks ago. I can't tell you to buy this though because I am not you. But I do highly recommened it. So listen to it and give it a chance.
0385507755|2.0|A lot of people really, really liked this book, and I too was quite impressed when I initially read it; it doesn't really hold up well under even the most cursory analysis, though. The whole &quot;dental work without even a local anesthetic&quot; thing, for example; go to a reputable health information site like MedlinePlus (or even the PDR if you have access to one and can understand the terminology) and look up information about Novocain or other local anesthetics, and try to find any kind of contraindication for chronic drug or alcohol abusers. Hint: You won't. Either he had local anesthetic and it hurt anyway, and it felt a lot worse because he was jonesing, or he insisted on refusing it because, you know, he's such a hard, hard guy.<br />And he doesn't let you forget just what a hard, hard guy he is, either. He makes fun of the unnamed rock star, probably Steven Tyler from the description (and, by the way, what's the whole deal about not naming Hazelden? I've never been there, but it took me all of about ten seconds to guess which place he was talking about), for exaggerating his alcohol and substance abuse, but he himself does the same damn thing, more than once. He takes pains to emphasize how his recovery crowd, the ones who have hit rock bottom, are somehow superior to the ones that sought recovery before things got that bad. Counselors and his mobster buddy can't tell him often enough what an amazingly hard man he is. He rejects the twelve steps out of hand, without stopping to consider that his reliance on the Tao might just count as trusting in a Higher Power. Even though he's spent the previous several years in a drugged/alcoholic haze, he tracks down his relapsing girlfriend in a city he's never been to in seemingly no time at all. And so on.<br />I don't want to give the impression that the book has no redeeming values. Frey very effectively portrays the very slow and very painful process of rebuilding himself physically. The numerous small acts of kindness depicted are, indeed, quite touching. Even his explanation for &quot;The Fury&quot;, although a little simplistic, is still plausible. Frankly, I can't blame him for remembering the extremely traumatic events of over a decade ago maybe a little bit differently from how they actually happened. I'd just caution fellow readers to take the book with a grain of salt, especially if they're somewhere in their own recovery journey.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Buy the version with the DVD containing the &quot;Hurt&quot; video, the most moving music video I have seen.  Without the video, the song is powerful; with it, one can experience even more, as the images are well selected and well arranged.  <br />Although I am an atheist, I enjoyed Cash' version of the End Times on &quot;The Man Comes Around,&quot; using such interesting phrases as &quot;The Father Hen will call his chickens home&quot; and the Biblical parablic allusion about the virgins trimming their wicks.<br />Perhaps the most moving line is to hear Cash, with his faded voice, sing, in &quot;Streets of Laredo,&quot; &quot;It was once in the saddle<BR>I used to go dashing,&quot; realizing his dashing days are long gone, with the sum of his days nearly expired as well.<br />A wonderful album that you do not want to miss.  Just be sure you get the DVD, as well.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|It's just great! I think everyone who loves reggie, even is not a fan of Bob Marley, must have this album in his/her archive. Especially, in War his performance is great.You can listen this wonderful album until the end of your life...
0385507755|4.0|James Frey tells a moving story.  I recommend this book to anyone dealing with their addiction or who has a loved one who is confronting addiction.  I could not put the book down.
B000051YEG|5.0|Man this is a lecherous record, but lechery never felt so good.  This has got to be up there as the coolest half hour of tunes ever made.  You must own this.  One of the top twenty albums of the 70's for sure.  Really creepy but amazing.  The sea change comparison is on point, but this album is much less languid, and much more intriguing and exciting.  Buy it and creep yourslef out as you think how cool it is.
B0000640VN|5.0|Okay, I am not into romances, but my wife is. I put off seeing this because of the dopeyness that I expected. It was better than that, though. Enough science, intrigue and romance to be a good mix. Definitely a good date mix, but even good for a wider audience.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I love this CD as much as the next guy.  Beck is fantastic, and has clearly matured a lot (although i think mutations is much better).  I must say though, if you like this, buy Serge Gainsbourg's Histoire de Melody Nelson.  Beck totally took his music from this.  Paper Tiger = Melody.  I have no problem with that i guess, just check it out.  So it goes.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|This is a very good movie with realistic turns of events that make the viewers believe it could happen to them. Good acting and good delivery. Put it on your list.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I think it is a great album. It's still in my cd player and I've had it for over 2 months. It's witty and serious all at the same time. As a college student, sometimes I wanna drop out and I think the skits are really amusing. I especially like the line, &quot;you read all those books that you're not gonna remember&quot;. 'The Workout Out Plan' is freakin hilarious and I listen to it every time I listen to the cd. There is some really good singing on it too, especially the track entitled &quot;Family Business&quot;. <BR>It's not a listen beginning to end, not touch the skip button, but it is definitely worth the money ($15).
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This is good enough for viewing and certainly more likely to be well received by older generations and/or people who have lost a parent. Keeps moving at an adequate pace to keep interest, although it is somewhat predictable.
B000294SFW|5.0|This is the best music I have listened to for a long time<BR>  Buy it, you wont be sorry
B000002VMH|5.0|It is obvious that paid critics are still critics and DO NOT reflect what fans and people with taste want!!! Daniel Durchholz's ridiculous accusations and paid reviews fall flat!!! Enough said and you have no merit. DIVA is Annie Lennox's masterpiece and that shows clearly throughout this album. This album introduced and silenced those nay  sayers who believed that the former Eurythmics front woman could not cut it. Annie has the intelligence, wisdom and vocal chops that continue to elude about 90% of today's pop startlets!!! Here Annie ranks with the likes of Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin,Joni Mitchell, and perhaps Mariah. One can't help but get lost whether on the raw emmotions of songs like Why? or Walking on Broken Glass. If you are serious about listening to some great music then purchase this album now. I have already worn out my copies and its time for a new one or maybe a back up copy too. Unlike, any starlet here you get an amazing voice, intelligent lyrics written by her, and music that is just timeless.
6305291446|4.0|In 1978, John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot; became one of the largest and the most successful independant motion picture of all time. It was scary, clever, well acted, and entertaining. While several slasher sequels followed (&quot;Halloween II&quot; (1981), &quot;Halloween III: Season on the Witch&quot; (1983), &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot; (1988), &quot;Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot; (1989), and &quot;Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers&quot; (1995)) none were as good, nor scary as the original. &quot;Halloween H20&quot; is not as good or scary as the original, but it comes darn close. Being often discriminated, &quot;H20&quot; is an entertaining movie with some good points including a good cast and some great thrills, but the only problem is its inconsistansies with the rest of the &quot;Halloween&quot; series. If you're scared and want a treat on Halloween night, then rent a &quot;Halloween&quot; movie, and you might find &quot;H20&quot; the one you like.<BR>First of all, the cast of &quot;Halloween H20&quot; is amazing. Jamie Lee Curtis steals the show in an unstoppable fashion. She has flipped the character of Lourie Strode around so much from the original's shy geeky Lourie to &quot;H20's&quot; tough and serious Lourie. Now an alchaholic head mistress at a private school in California (the only &quot;Halloween&quot; not in Haddonfield!). She has a son named John (Josh Hartnet) who is dating a blonde babe named Molly (Michelle Williams) and whose two friends are Sarah (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and Charlie (Adam Hann-Byrd). Laurie also is seeing someone (since her husband, who I believe may have been Jimmy from &quot;Halloween II&quot;, and her are now seperated). The guy she is seeing is the school guidance councelor Will (Adam Arkin). Michael Myers is played by Chris Durand. Also in the cast are LL Cool J as Ronny the school security guard and Marion Whittington (Nancy Stevens) who appeared in both &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Halloween II&quot;. Although all the actors are good at their roles, Jamie Lee Curtis steal the show. She is the new Dr. Loomis- the hero of the story. Her final confrontation with Michael Myers is legendary. Curtis has also done a great job with every role, and it is visible in this movie how she has matured as an actress from the orignal &quot;Halloween&quot; to now. It is a common fact that most horror films have bad actors, but this movie doesn't- it has a great cast.<BR>Secondly, this movie has an assortment of good thrills, chills, and scares. Not as scary as the first, but still a jumpy thriller, &quot;H20&quot; makes its mark in the horror industry. The beginning is the scariest part of the movie, and all throughout the movie you keep expecting Michael Myers to pop up out of no where and kill someone. For instance, Lourie is having visions and nightmares where she sees Michael coming. But how does she know if its really him or not. Another good scare would be when Michael is stalking John, Molly, Sarah, and Charlie while they all are at the school when it is closed down. &quot;Halloween H20&quot; is scary and jittery, but is fun to watch, and will not give you nightmares.<BR>Finally, even with a great cast and some good scares, &quot;Halloween H20&quot; has a major flaw. It totally forgets about &quot;Halloween 4&quot;, &quot;Halloween 5&quot;, and &quot;Halloween 6&quot;. &quot;H20&quot; makes it seem as if Michael has been anonymous for the last 20 years ever since &quot;Halloween II&quot; ended. Of course there would be no mention of &quot;Halloween III&quot; since it had nothing to do with Michael Myers. This is not good because yes, &quot;Halloween 5&quot; and &quot;Halloween 6&quot; were somewhat weak, but &quot;Halloween 4&quot; was a good movie, even better than &quot;H20&quot;. And even if the sequels were all bad, they are still apart of the series, and therefore must not be forgotten. For instance, Lourie's daughter Jamie from &quot;Halloween 4&quot; was not mentioned at all in this movie, and with the introduction of John, Jamie's story is a little confusing. Another bad connection would be that Michael Myers had no burns on him, which is strange considering that in &quot;Halloween II&quot; he was nearly burned to death. The character of Dr. Loomis is only mentioned once, and his death is made unclear, saying he 'died' a few years ago, while in fact, he was murdered by Michael Myers in 1995. There are several other noticable flaws connecting this movie with the rest of the series, and that alone somewhat ruins the movie for any real &quot;Halloween&quot; fan.<BR>To conclude, this movie is awesome with its good cast and thrilling writing, but it lacks as a part of the &quot;Halloween&quot; 'series'. This is, however, a great movie to watch. It is very entertaining, and if you can put its flaws behind, then you should enjoy it almost as much as the original. Jamie Lee Curtis and her supporting cast are great, there are some suspenseful and jumpy parts, and this movie is overall a typical slasher flick of the 90's. The film also just goes to show that even 20 years later, the &quot;Halloween&quot; series is still making a killing in the horror industry, which is more than can be said for &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; or &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;. Get scared today, and buy &quot;Halloween H20&quot; to complete your &quot;Halloween&quot; collection.
B000001EL3|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to the group when I was only 4yrs old. This is my favorite since it captures a very special time for me. I loved it from the moment that the needle dropped on the intro track DRC and I initially listened to those mysterious voices reading the headlines. The fact that the group does not play on every track does not bother me at all. Sometimes the music speaks volumes or begins to do so years after the record goes into the collective dust bin. Destroyer sounds fresh today 2004 as it did then. Kiss created a wall of sound and fantasy that only elevated and layed the blue print of what they could accomplish.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Horror films are usually the least looked upon in the cinema business. This is mostly because they are poor and really stupid- most of the time. However, every once and a while, a horror movie comes out that truly is spectacular. In 1978, &quot;Halloween&quot; was that horror movie. It was a simple film with a simple plot and an unknown cast (with the exception of Donald Pleasance). Yet somehow &quot;Halloween&quot; became one of, if not the most, successful independant motion pictures of all time. Why was this? It was because of a simple plot made into a terrifying story, a good and well picked cast, and a little amount of gore and unnessisary violence. It is true that &quot;Halloween&quot; was nothing more than perfect.<br />To start, the story of &quot;Halloween&quot; is not a very complex one. There is no twist, no supernatural demon, and no long and mind boggling mysteries. &quot;Halloween&quot; is simply a slasher movie, but it is the first of its kind. In 1978, people had been used to slasher films such as &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; or &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;, and even other horror types including &quot;The Omen&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. Many people may think that &quot;Halloween&quot; runs close to &quot;Psycho&quot;, and it does, but &quot;Halloween&quot; can stand on its own too. &quot;Psycho&quot; was a classic about people who went to the Bates Motel and ended up killed. &quot;Halloween&quot; is a movie about a killer who goes to a town to kill. The difference is that in &quot;Psycho&quot; people went to the killer, while in &quot;Halloween&quot; the killer was already there. The story is simple- a seemingly normal boy named Michael Myers murders his sister Judith in cold blood on Halloween night, 1963. His parents then sent him away to a mental institution where he was put under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance). For 15 years Michael didn't talk and acted as if there was nothing inside of him anymore, but on October 30, 1978, nearly 15 after the murder of Judith, Michael escaped. Michael then traveled back to his home town of Haddonfield where he left a trail of blood and death so that Sam Loomis could follow. There, Michael stalked a young woman named Lourie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends Annie (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda (PJ Soles). While Michael is in town, Dr. Loomis arrives to warn Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) about Michael returning. The Sheriff is of course skepticle about his story. From that point on, when Lourie and Annie both go babysitting, it is all out suspense. Michael stalks Annie, Lourie, and even Lynda when she arrives with her boyfriend Bob (John Michael Graham). Its not a very complex plot, but it can entertain you just as much as any other movie.<br />Second, the cast of &quot;Halloween&quot; makes it a classic. Donald Pleasance stars as the hero of the film and does a wonderful job. His performances are always very good and entertaining, and he is just perfect for the role. Jamie Lee Curtis does the best job of the bunch though. Her mother, Janet Leigh, stared in &quot;Psycho&quot; and in the imfamous shower scene. It was hard for Curtis to match up to her outstanding mother, but she did it. It was her first starring role in &quot;Halloween&quot; and it was all she needed. &quot;Halloween&quot; boosted Curtis' career so that she would appear in many other films and become one of the most recognized actresses in the world. Nancy Loomis plays the role of Annie just greatly acting like a self absorbed teenager who is unsuspecting of Michael's presence learking nearby. PJ Soles is beautiful and also perfect for her role. She would later become known as the &quot;Totally Girl&quot; from &quot;Halloween&quot; for her constant dialogue that always had the word totally in it. Charles Cyphers was enjoyable  and Nick Castle is a very intimidating Michael Myers. Castle creates an creepy and unforgettable villain. John Carpenter and Deborah Hill are to thank for the clever writing, and Carpenter is also known for compsoing the creepy &quot;Halloween Theme&quot; that has become very well known around the world. When you hear it, you'll know what's on. Carpenter also did a great job directing the film and &quot;Halloween&quot; also launched him into a superior director state. Carpenter even said in an interview that to create a perfect horror movie, you need an unknown cast. This was proven true, beacuse &quot;Halloween&quot; was a perfect horror flick with an unknown cast.<br />Lastly, although a horror flick, &quot;Halloween&quot; had little blood letting. This is probably why it is so popular among the public. Unlike many horror film that were influenced and followed it (including &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;), &quot;Halloween&quot; does not resort to unbelievable death scenes and gross gore. No, &quot;Halloween&quot; knows that it can be scary without gore, and that it does. It is important for people to see that a gory and violent horror movie doesn't make it scary, but a scary story is what makes it scary. Many films to follow &quot;Halloween&quot; in the 1980's have too much blood and guts shown, creating a dull and very disliked movie. &quot;Halloween&quot; will never be disliked for violence, because it doesn't drive off of it in order to be successful. If you want to watch a scary move, watch &quot;Halloween&quot;, if you want to watch a gory movie, don't watch &quot;Halloween&quot;.<br />To conclude, &quot;Halloween&quot; is a classic that can not be remade or outdone. It just simply great and alwasy will be. With a great story, a perfect cast, and little blood letting, &quot;Halloween&quot; is a movie that will surely deliver 'one good scare'. If you want to start a horror movie collection, or if you just want are thinking about buying this movie, I highly recommend you do. &quot;Halloween&quot; will make you jump and scream the whole way through. It can be said that &quot;Halloween&quot; is a timeless classic, and a damn scary one too. Don't get a trick, but get a treat- get &quot;Halloween&quot;- the horror movie that totally redefined the motion picture business.to thank for the clever writing, and Carpenter is also known for compsoing the creepy &quot;Halloween Theme&quot; that has become very well known around the world.

B00024BHTC|5.0|CHANGED MY MIND. I GIVE THIS ALBUM 3 STARS NOT FIVE. FROM ALL NIGHTWISH ALBUMS THIS IS THE LEATSE I LIKE TOGETHER WITH ANGELS FALL FIRST. SORRY GUYS. BUT I JUST CAN'T LISTEN TO IT ANYMORE WHILE THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS SOUND STILL GREAT...      Once is not the band's best album. I believe that Century Child together with Oceanborn is their best. However, its unfair to judge their last album with the previous standards that existed for the band as this one is quite different and has many new elements that add to their sound.   For example, we have one of the best european orchestras contributing to the album giving a soundtrack feeling to the songs wherever necessary without overusing their sound.    The guitars are heavier than their previous albums and Tarya sometimes change her voice adding variety to the songs. The male vocals are just fantastic.    Overall, the songs are good and more mature than ever before.  The only dissadvantage that I can find is that maybe their songs luck the excitement and surprise that Oceanborn and Century Child had. Yet, maybe its better for a band to move on and evolve (like In Flames) through their course than remain stagnant. If they do it right then its ok and Nightwish know what they are doing.    In Germany and in a 3 weeks their album has sold more than 100,000 copies and it has been #1 now in Germany, Finland, Norway, Slovenia, Hungary and Greecen (23-6-04).
B000002WPI|5.0|When trying to describe this album, I have trouble finding the words.  I think what I love about this album is that it is a blast to listen to.  Think about it, has there ever been a hip hop record that combined so many different group members with different styles and pulled it off?  I doubt it.  There are so many different characters to this album.  You have to listen to the whole thing again and again just to take in the lyrical genius of these 9 guys.  An awesome album beginning to end.
B0002858YS|5.0|The Killers opened up for Stellastarr, and I became intrigued in their sound. It was definitely an 80's revivalist type of noise.  To me it was like indie rock with a synthpoppy edge taking shape here and there, giving the sound a real dynamic feel. The sound quality in the building wasnt something to brag about, but the live set sounded quite vibrant and powerful. The lead singer's voice seemed like a Robert Smith/Butch Walker mix, and fortunately I enjoy both those artists, so I enjoyed listening. It ended up being one of the best opening acts I had ever seen. <br />So of course I wait until the album hits stores. <br />It retains much of the energy of the live show. The vocals sound very strong, as do the keys and synths, though sometimes they seem to overshadow all the other instruments. Track I really get into are &quot;Jenny was a Friend of Mine&quot;, &quot;Smile Like you Mean It&quot;, the single &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot;, &quot;All These Things That Ive Done&quot;, &quot;On Top&quot;, and &quot;Mr Brightside&quot;, which is my personal favorite. The last third or so of the record isnt quite as good as the first parts, but overall this new band's new album is pretty enjoyable. I really like listening to it driving on a sunny day. And its cheap, so why not take the risk?

B000002BVN|5.0|the first time i took a look at this album, i was like, no way. a waste of money. but like all mj songs, you really need to listen to them to be able to judge. and boy was i wrong. blood on the dance floor is like the song billie jean in so many ways, and yet is unique in its message and composition. ya'll should check out the video for it. and superfly sister is one of the most amazing songs i have ever heard. i mean, the style he uses is just so gruff and yet personal. you think he's being random but this his private life he's singing about. ghosts and is it scary are so brutally honest and direct they make you stop and say, &quot;whoa.&quot; and yet people say that mj is one of the most secretive people. gimme a break. everything that you need to know about this man and the scandals surrounding him is in those songs. <BR>as for the remixes, they're awesome cause the songs themselves are awesome and michael the man is totally awesome.<BR>go figure, right?<BR>that's why i give this album a 5/5. please people. do yourselves a favor and listen to some REAL music. buy this album. and you're welcome.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This CD is no let down from the previous 2. It is a heavy metal masterpiece with amazing drums and guitar. Not buying a CD like this would be a crime!!!! I'll admit it's not as heavy as the first 2 cds(slipknot and Iowa) but it still packs a heavy metal<BR>punch.
1592400876|3.0|My husband and I decided to collaborate on a single review.  But we differed in our opinions of the book (he is English and adored what he perceived to be the book's charm; I approached the book with some skepticism, having heard Lynn Truss misuse the subjunctive in an NPR interview).  However, we both enjoyed the clever examples in the book of how punctuation affects meaning.  So take your choice:<br />Here's how my husband punctuated his review:<br />I like this book.  Think - punctuation matters!  But little attention should be paid to the book's silly punctuation jokes.  This book bores right in the heart of the matter, where Lynn Truss has plunged.  A stake in the rules of good punctuation - it all benefits.  The bottom line is truly caring about effective communication all over. <br />Here's how I punctuated mine:<br />I, like this book, think punctuation matters but little.  Attention should be paid to the book's silly punctuation jokes.  This book bores.  Right?   In the heart of the matter, where Lynn Truss has plunged a stake, in the rules of good punctuation - it all benefits the bottom line.  Is truly caring about effective communication all over?
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is a terrific album; but listening to the lyrics, which can be repetitive (it's a style, not a flaw--lyrics criticized on the basis of repitition are baseless and only evoke the listeners utter lack of sophistication), make you think--if you take them at face value, they might appear superficial or weak--but when you think about them, often times they are pretty profound.  I know people aren't used to thinking, but maybe they should try before they criticize the album on the basis of words.<br />Of course, Madonna has never been known for strong lyrics--she's not a lyricist...the music on the album is great, a little mellow, but you know what mellow is nice every now and then.  I also think the album, musically and otherwise more than adequately captures where we are right now and it asks some of the questions that, after the excesses of previous years, I think should be asked. And, of course, anyone who has followed Madonna's career readily realizes that she is poking fun--frequently.  <br />I don't understand why people are attacking her on the basis of her age--her music is timeless--plus, she looks better than 90% of the twenty year olds who are out there now; not to mention that her music, the music, is far more intelligent, far more interesting and far more long-lasting than anything that the princesses of pop are coming out with these days.<br />And the comparison to Cher was just straight-up stupid. (Sorry)
B000092Q4U|4.0|When I first heard all ten tracks on the CD, I loved it. There were two guitarists (Mark Morton and Willie Adler) that just grind their way through the songs. I also liked Chris Adler's masterful performance on drums. It sort of reminds me of the old Metallica days (before Load, Reload, Garage, Inc.) in the way that the drums just keep on going, not even bothering to stop for anything until the end of the song (that's what it sounds like to me anyways). John Campbell did a pretty damn good job on bass as well.<br />The only things that bother me are: (1) Randy Blythe's voice can get repetitive at times, and that might be because of (2)Only ten songs on the album! Or it could probably be because the CD only adds up to about 38 minutes. I'm hoping that they have more songs on their next CD that helps extend the time anywhere between 45 and 60+ minutes. But I'll still buy it even if it doesn't.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I treasure this dvd.  I have arranged it to fit prominently in my dvd collection.  Warner bros. has given the dvd buyer a well deserved treat.  This is the most gorgeous transfer and restoration I have ever seen on dvd.  The movie is the best revelation of the golden years of Hollywood. I became a fan of the Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland pairing from my viewing of this Robin Hood dvd.  It led me to discover that Flynn and De Havilland did eight movies together.  I have found The Santa Fe Trail on dvd.  However, that movie and Robin Hood are the only two movies released on dvd that star this famous movie Hollywood couple! I can't believe Warner bros. have not released the great movies on dvd of this wonderful movie couple.  I am waiting anxiously for the dvd release of Captain Blood, The Charge of the Light Brigade, They Died With Their Boots On, Dodge City.  The magic chemistry of Flynn and de Havilland is delightful.  Warner Bros. where is the Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland dvd box set!

B000099T2L|4.0|The only mistake Beyonce made with her debut solo album is that trying to pass the first five tracks is a difficult task.  Because the dance numbers are lumped at the beginning of the album, and the ballads overtaking the rest of the project, it feels too tiring trying to get through this good but uneven debut.  Of course my review comes a little late, seeing as how nobody gives a damn what order the songs appeared in on the album, Beyonce is a bona-fide diva.  Having headlined a tour alongside Miss Keys and Missy, it was truly Beyonce's year.  For anyone expecting this album NOT to be highly stylized and well made for mainstream listeners, you need look elsewhere, because as much as I love Miss Knowles, she is as mainstream as they come.  That's not to say the woman isn't talented.  She was at the producers helm, crafting her album and making it her own.<br />Beyonce knew what sounds were the hottest, as evident on the wildly successful and funky tune 'Crazy in Love.'  The classic horns sample, along with Jay-Z's chilled flow skills makes it a great song.  Dancehall music was of course the genre of 2003 and continues to dominate 2004 along with crunk.  What would a dancehall track be without Sean Paul?  'Babyboy' actually took awhile to appeal to me.  Because dancehall riddims were everywhere and anywhere during the single's release, it became quite redundant, but nonetheless it is a great dance tune.<br />'Hip-Hop Star' and 'Naughty Girl' wear out their welcome quite quick.  On 'Naughty Girl', Beyonce tries to hard to be...well... naughty, and while her homage to Donna Summer is appreciated, it doesn't mean the track holds through for a long amount of time.<br />What would an r&amp;b divas album be without ballads.  Most original is Beyonce's female empowering 'Me, Myself, &amp; I', it is a great track with its vintage soul sound and Beyonce's soaring vocals.  On the sensual &quot;Gift From Virgo&quot;, Beyonce's lush voice fuses with Missy Elliots always innovative melodies.  It is another standout track.  'Be With You' is also well done, with it's groovy, vintage beat and Miss Knowles slinky vocals.<br />All in all, Beyonce is your run of the mill diva.  As much as I love her sound and watching her perform live, she is in every way a mainstream songbird.  If you like slickly produced, and at times souless r&amp;b, Beyonce fits the bill almost too perfectly.  She certainly struck while the iron was hot, and she owned the year.  Dangerously in Love is a good CD, but if many music buyers are still wary of its quality, I say buy the singles at your local Media Play, Sam Goody or whatever... because they are the strongest and best cuts from the album.
0451196716|3.0|This book is creepy version of the future. To think that anyone would volunteer to walk for days without rest at four miles per hour is almost unbelievable. But Stephen King makes it believable. I probably would have enjoyed the book more if I had been born when the book was written and I had a vague idea of what the walkers were talking about. I don't know of any teenagers that talk like that.<BR>     Every King fan should check this out. In my opinion, it doesn't compare to some of his better works, but is still worth a read.
6304936303|5.0|The best action movie of the 90's hands down!  All this crap about the film being misogynistic is ridiculous. Willis' character is a burned out, embittered, down and out, has-been PI and former secret service agent (&quot;a long time ago he saved the president's life&quot; )who has seen too much and who has no faith left in anything. He is in a bad marriage, never home, drinks too much, a victim of marital infidelity.  But he is still in love with his wife. (&quot;I wish the sky wasn't blue, I wish water wasn't wet. I wish I didn't still love my wife.&quot;) He is a man's man of the old school; strong and ever silent with a black and white morality. He is loyal to a fault, taking on the case of the stripper and her boyfriend to avenge the car-bombing death of his best friend (who was sleeping with his wife.) His foul mouthed daughter is screaming for discipline which she finds (and drinks in ) at the end of the film. The one liners are great.  The action scenes are awesome.  The justice meted out in the end is fitting.
B00000DLV1|5.0|One of the best live recordings I have ever heard, this album is as beautiful and uniquely melodic as it is soulful.  Beth Gibbons tugs at heart strings, and her performance is legendary.  If Portishead never records again, I believe it would be a travesty.  Modern music has been bastardized, making stars out of gimmicks whilst failing to relate to the human condition at even its fundamental levels.  With Portishead, the themes of love, loss, regret, loneliness and obsession are treated with an honest and appropriate delicacy; and the wall of sound that serves as its backdrop is like nothing you've heard before. There isn't a trace of superficiality here, and the live recording serves only to enhance the nakedness of its themes. Technically speaking, this isn't your standard 4 piece perfromance, this is a comprehensive array of instrumentation.<br />This album is a classic, pure and simple.  And while trip-hop has evolved itself into near oblivion, we are left with a live album that does not merely define a lost genre, it transcends it.  It is a standalone effort that defies classification.  It is, quite simply, what it is - a great listen.  a must have.
B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera's second metal album<br />On Vulgar Display of Power we see Pantera evolve into the band we all know them now to be.  Phil puts aside the high pitched screams for an angrier approach.  An the music itself has a heavier feel thanks to Dime, Vinne and Rex.  Vulgar Display of Power is Pantera's most recognized album.  This is where you would start if you wanted to show someone the best metal of the nineties.  Highlights Include; Mouth For War, Walk and Hollow
B00005NNMK|5.0|This CD was the best I'v herd.It kicked ass.Exspecially Final Countdown, Carrie, and Rock The Night. The money and time is worth it.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera's Debut As a Metal Band<br />Cowboys From Hell is one of the best metal albums of the nineties.  On this album Phil Anselmo takes a very different approach to the vocals then on later outings.  He uses a higher pitched wail on some of the songs, and he sings alot more on here.  Something that is a rarity on later albums.  This is a classic metal album.  Pantera fans who don't own this album; you will be dissapointed if you are looking for the brutality of the later albums.  This is a great place to start to introduce new people to the band.  Hightlights Include; Cowboys From Hell, Cemetery Gates and Domination

B000002H97|4.0|Metallica's Fifth Album; often reffered to as the Black Album<br />This album is hard to review because on one hand this album recieves too much praise as being Metallica's greatest.  On the other hand alot of the fans dismiss it as a sellout just because of all the attention it was getting.  In both cases they are all wrong.  It is not thier best work but to dismiss it as a bad album is wrong as well.  There are just too many great songs on here to not recognize this disc.  The guitar work is not nearly as technical as ...And Justice For All (the album that preceded Black) and the vocals are alot cleaner then all previous attempts.  However you can't deny this record and just scoff it off as a sellout.  Highlights Include; Sad But True, Wherever I May Roam and Stuggle Within
B00003CXCT|1.0|If you loved the original movies in 1977 and 1979 you will not buy this butchered set.  These are not the movies we originally loved and which fans did so much to make a success.  Lucas would not be where he is today without the support of those fans, and yet he has chosen to spit on them.  I would not have any problem with Lucas tinkering with these movies as long as, like Spielberg, he allowed the originals to circulate as well.  But his attempt to bury the originals ought to clue you in as to his confidence in his own alterations. Why is so afraid to let the originals circulate as well?  Lucas knows full well he's destroying these movies but his ego is too inflated to let him stop.  He must realize how inferior the \\"prequels\\" are, but the sad fact is the more creative control is handed over to Lucas the worse the movies become. <br />And to those of you who say \\"These are Lucas' movies, he can do what he wants.\\" I would argue that is not the case.  A movie is a collaborative effort, hundreds of individuals came together to make these movies.  Lucas was the guiding spirit but he is not solely responsible for their success, nor should he have sole veto on our right to see the original movies we loved.
B000001C6M|4.0|Slayer's First Album (also note my rating is 4.5 stars not just 4)<br />Show No Mercy was never really my favorite Slayer Album; Reign In Blood and Seasons In The Abyss took that honor.  A while back I put in Show No Mercy and couldin't believe that all these years I discarded this as an ok album.  Im tempted to say it is my favorite from Slayer.  It is a great Trash Album that helped start the whole thrash movement.  Highlights Include; Antichrist, Die By The Sword and Black Magic
B0002234LS|4.0|I just got done watching this movie and i must say its alot better than i thought it would be Johnny Depp plays a writer haunted by a man that calls himself Shooter claiming that Depp stole his storie its  a thriller and its worth watching it is also based off a book by Stephen King
B000002UUX|5.0|Megadeth's Fourth Album <br />Rust in Peace is often hailed as Megadeth's best by the majority of thier fans.  Im a pretty big Deth fan and this is my favorite as well.  If your already a Deth fan and don't have this get it now, you are missing the centerpiece of the Megadeth collection.  Every song on this album contributes something good to the disc.  Highlights Include; Holy Wars, Hangar 18 and Rust In Peace
B00005JKZ3|3.0|A film by Barry Sonnenfeld<br />After 1997's wildly successful \\"Men in Black\\" film, someone apparently decided that it would be a good idea to make a sequel.  After all, the director and the two stars are returning, what could possibly go wrong?  A great deal, as it turns out.  The first film covered a good deal of ground and a good deal of story points.  The second film had the opportunity to really build on that as well as becoming a movie that is just as entertaining as the first.  \\"Men in Black II\\" fails to measure up to the first film.  What felt fresh in the first movie feels tired and just recycled in the sequel.  There are some good moments, but if you've seen the trailer, you have seen most of the good moments.<br />The basic plot is that there is an alien named Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) who is searching for something called the Light of Zartha.  It would be very dangerous for the Earth, as well as several other planets if Serleena is able to acquire the Light, whatever it may be.  When Serleena holds up a pizza place and leaves a witness, one of the Men in Black is called in to investigate.  Agent J (Will Smith) meets the witness, an attractive young woman, and finds out what went down.  But Agent J can't solve this case on his own, he needs Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).  Viewers of the first movie will remember that K retired, had his memory wiped and is now working at a post office in some small town.  Of course there is a way to reverse this and the partners are reunited and are fighting the evil aliens of the universe.<br />There are some funny parts to this movie.  I loved the talking/singing dog/alien/agent.  There were several funny gags and funny lines, but taken as a whole I didn't care for the movie all that much.  It passed the time.  I know this is not the type of movie that one is supposed to take too seriously, but even on that basis, it's still not that good.  \\"Men in Black II\\" is not horrible, but everyone involved has done better work.<br />-Joe Sherrybr />-Joe Sherry
B000002JR8|4.0|Pantera's third metal album (note that my rating is 4.5 stars not just 4)<br />With Far Beyond Driven Pantera managed to make thier music even heavier.  The end result was some of thier best work.  The main drawback to the album is the lack of this incredible work. The terrible tracks 25 Years and Good Friends drag this this album down while the mediocre tracks Shedding Skin and Throes of Rejection just add to the problem.  The remainder of the songs are Pantera doing what they do best, it is only the aforementioned filler that holds down this album from being as monumental as it could have.  Highlights Include; Becoming, 5 Minutes Alone and I'm Broken
B000268QB2|5.0|What happened to enjoying music purely because of its accessability and good tunes? There is nothing more unfair than attaching a huge bag of hype on a young band, comparing them to great artists who sound similar in an attempt to sell records. Of course, a point of comparison is always welcome, but to haze the band for not sounding exactly like the established band is in bad taste. There is hardly a band out there - especially in te mainstream - who does not borrow elements from past artists. The completely original artists are making music so out there and new that they are on the fringes of the industry, and time deals with them accordingly. Velvet Underground, Big Star - commercially underachieving bands who have influenced bands for decades to come after their demise.<BR>Keane does not sound like Radiohead. Keane does not sound like Coldplay. Let's get that out of the way. The less we compare Keane to those two bands, the easier it will be to enjoy the album on its own strenghts. Keane is a trio consisting of piano, drums and vocals. This is a unique line-up, and one that is easily distinguishable from other mopey rock acts. &quot;Hopes &amp; Fears&quot; will not set the world on fire (unless they catch on, which I'm hoping for), but it will be a treasured part of any collection that includes it.<BR>Any successful band's debut album was confident in its aspirations: Oasis' to shake up listeners, Franz Ferdinand's to move your body, and the Stone Roses' to change the entire music world. Keane's debut is confident in its ability to write touching, meaningful songs with strong melodies and decent lyrics, and this earnestness and charm works wonders on listeners. After all, it did work for Coldplay. With a strong debut album behind them, it is now up to Keane to follow it up with a better sophomore album, and I believe it is entirely within their grasp. Enjoy &quot;Hopes &amp; Fears&quot; on its own strenghts, and you will find a great album.
B000002V0Q|5.0|Megadeth's Fifth Album<br />On this outing you will see that Megadeth made thier songs a bit more commercialized and acessible.  After listening to this album uncountable times I can honestly tell you that it doesn't even make a difference.  This is Megadeth at the top of thier game musically and lyrically.  All Megadeth fans should have this in thier collection, it is essential.  Highlights Include; Symphony of Destruction, Sweating Bullets and Ashes In Your Mouth
B0002858YS|3.0|I first saw The Killers at a Stellastar concert, and although Stellastar didn't impress me, The Killers did.  Their singer is the most charismatic performer in the world and it was really a nice experience.  As for their cd... it's OK.  Of course, Somebody Told Me is catchy as hell and is worth a 99 cent download (or however you decide to obtain it).  The other 10 songs on this cd are okay, with some ups and downs, but nothing quite remarkable.  And that's why it deserves a 3.  I enjoy listening to it, but I guess it doesn't have enough substance to warrant a higher rating.
B00008CLOA|5.0|pay attention the next time you listen to dsotm. it will start with a quiet heartbeat, like that of an unborn child. this heartbeat will grow louder and stronger as would that of a baby growing bigger and stronger in the womb. soon you will hear a woman scream 4 times like a woman would scream while giving birth. the album then takes you through various factors that affect us as human beings. these are time, money, conflict, sanity(or insanity in this case). the album ends with your life flashing before youre eyes (all that you touch, all that you see, all that you taste, all you feel, etc, etc). heartbeat fades and stops. i think i heard somewhere that when your heart stops beating you die. roger waters has stated that the concept of this album is a life cycle. nasa sent a copy of dsotm on voyager space probes so if aliens found it they might gain some understanding of the human race. if you still dont understand the concept of this album, you can still enjoy the jaw- dropping beauty of the songs. you can still enjoy the way the music flows and stops, you can still enjoy the thought provoking lyrics. like a movie is a visual presentation of a story, this is an audio presentation of a human life. if you rented a movie would you fast foreward to somewhere in the middle of it, watch part of it and think you knew all about it? this album requires that you listen and pay attention from start to finish, just like a movie. by the way, this record seems to be as popular today as it ever was, perhaps because is and always will be relevent. as long a people are born, live and die. it will be relevent. no album in the history of this planet has ever connected with people the way this one has, and of course a work of this magnitude, influence, and popularity is going to upset some folks that think just because they don't like it, it's no good. ignore them, ignore me, listen to the album and decide for yourself.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Although this album was released all the way back in 1995, I just got my first taste of it. I have always known about Wu Tang Clan but I never got a chance to hear much from them because they are not as mainstream and commercial. After listening to GZA's Liquid Sword I was quite amazed. Why does someone who has such story telling and comparison lyrical skills is not on the radio and flowing in the mainstream and appearing on TRL and BET. I have not heard such great skills since back in the Biggie and 2Pac days. GZA has solid skills with great back up guest appearances from other Wu Tang members. (method man, RZA) The production of RZA was solid, and it somewhat tries to tell the story of Liquid Swords before songs. Some of the beats reminds me of the themes from the old martial art movies. Eventhough this album might not sound really appealing the first time, but every time you listen to it, you will hear something you missed the last time and be impressed by the kinda skill he displayed. Such artists like this are rarely found in the mainstream today. GZA is truly a genious with rhymes and brought the best out of the other guest appearances. This CD is definitely worth your money, it has depth although it talks streets and guns. The creativity in this album is far above many rappers even in the game today.<br />Lyrics: A+<BR>Production: A<BR>Delivery: A+<BR>Overall: A+
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|If you are a father or a son, I highly recommend Big Fish. This is the story of a son who finally learns to accept his father for who he really is. The story is told in an entertaining and whimisical manner (somewhat reminiscent of Forrest Gump). As Mark Twain once said \\"When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.\\" This movie takes that theme and tells a touching but not saccharin story a son reconciling his differences with his father when he finds out that his father has cancer. The cinematography and acting are both outstanding.<br />This movie was so good, I bought another copy for my father.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Okay, first thing, I give Kanye West big props for willing to make a single that shows his faith and his love for Jesus instead of making club hit. Because we all know that kind of song is not going to be played in clubs and will be ignored by many radio stations and therefore, he will not receive as much money and promotion. <br />Second thing, if you are going to humble, stay humble THROUGHOUT the whole album, dont tell everyone you are humble to God and you are glad that you are alive then pull out the cocky side later on in the album.<br />Third: Production. Sure thing he produced many hits, but for some reason some of the beats sounds familiar to some of the classics that I have heard before and some of his beats even sounds familiar to each other. Listen to the Jin song &quot;I Got a Love&quot; which is also produced by Kanye West, you will find the beat to be extremely similiar to Twista's &quot;Celebrity Overnight&quot;. Maybe he is sampling, I am not making accusations but that is just what stacks up from the facts. <br />Forth: Lyrically, Kanye West is an idiot. He can't rap worth of lick and he has this fruity voice. He has no flow, even though some of the stuff he says are deep, they are canceled out with the shallow remarks &quot;tell me if that ain't insecurr...&quot; that just shows how  he is trying to be commercial and well known. NO, he is not from St. Louis.<br />Overall: Great for trying to reinvent hip-hop. A good thing is there is not alot of &quot;guns, hoes, ice, chry-stal, 24s....etc&quot; but the fact is he cannot rap and he cannot flow, you can call him a poet but not a lyricist or MC. There is no comparison to be made between him and 2Pac, sure they are both deep, but they are so many other artists that are deep and write meaningful songs. And sure, he is a great producer, even if he does samples, but before we make conclusions we must rethink that is he going to stay or is he going to be another trend that just comes and goes. I think some of his messages are great, some are not. I like some of the beats he produced even if he samples, but the fact is calling it &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;legendary&quot; is a little bit of overexaggeration. 5 years later, will the so-called deep song &quot;All Falls Down&quot; be played or even remembered?? or will it be like 2Pac's great work that still flourishes in our memory. This album is definitely something different from all the albums about cars and hoes and its a getter. I personally think its great but I would not call it a &quot;classic&quot;.<br />Lyrics: B+<BR>Delivery: C-<BR>Production: B+<BR>Overall: B<br />Solid effor despite all the minuses, I would check out his sequel.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|This CD Was incredible, from start to finish, this cd was totally amazing. Mick Thompson and Jim Root have totally grown on there guitar skills on this. From thrashing riffs, insane guitar solos that would leave Eddy Van Halen stunned, they even unplug and get serious with the music in 2 all acoustic songs. Corey Taylor shows his incredible vocal talent by shredding with nasty screams, but then quiets down and starts to actually sing. For all you idiots out there giving this cd a &quot;1&quot; because they wanted to change, then you're not maggots at all. Its funny how many people complain because they actually try to show skill, not just scream into the mic and hope people catch what they are saying. This album is purely amazing, and if you're an insane maggot, buy it. Even if you hate slipknot, there is something here for everyone. Its funny that Corey can actually write a great cd without the &quot;F&quot; word every 4 words.

B0001MDP3G|5.0|Adapted from Charles Frazier's book of the same name, Cold Mountain (2003) is an epic odyssey of one man's struggle to travel back home to the woman he loves set against the backdrop of the American Civil War. Unfairly snubbed at last year's Academy Awards, it is a moving film that has been given the royal treatment on DVD.<br />The first DVD features an audio commentary with writer-director Anthony Minghella and editor Walter Murch. He goes into great detail about the themes of the movie while Murch, not surprisingly, talks about how it was assembled through editing. Both men are very eloquent speakers and provide a fascinating look at how to make an epic period drama.<br />The second DVD begins with an exhaustive 70-minute documentary entitled, \\"Climbing Cold Mountain.\\" It starts off with the transition from novel to screenplay and then pretty much every aspect, from location scouting to casting, is examined in detail. There are excellent interviews with the principal actors (Law, Kidman, Zellweger) who talk about their experiences working on the movie.<br />There are 11 deleted scenes that are redundant for the most part and it is obvious to see why there were cut.<br />\\"The Words and Music of Cold Mountain\\" is a classy, 90-minute concert featuring many of the musicians who contributed to the movie's soundtrack, including Jack White, Sting and Alison Krauss. Interspersed amongst the musical performances are readings from Charles Frazier's book by actors Brendan Gleeson, Nicole Kidman and Jude Law. This is an impressive extra that fans of the movie will really enjoy.<br />\\"A Journey to Cold Mountain\\" is a 30-minute Making Of featurette that is more along the lines of press kit material. It feels a bit redundant after watching the 70-minute documentary and the 90-minute concert.<br />Musician Tim Eriksen talks about the \\"Sacred Harp History\\" which is a book of songs and the specific way they were song back in the day.<br />Finally, there is a \\"Storyboard Comparison\\" which looks at three scenes from the movie and how they match up with the storyboards.<br />Cold Mountain shows how the Civil War touched everyone. It made women into widows and turned brother against brother. It left thousands dead or maimed and left the United States devastated for a long time afterwards. Minghella's film is balanced in that it shows inhuman acts perpetrated on both sides and how two people find each other amidst all of this chaos and madness. Miramax has assembled an impressive DVD with extras that are substantial-something rare for a recently made movie.\\" which looks at three scenes from the movie and how they match up with the storyboards.<br />Cold Mountain shows how the Civil War touched everyone.

B000002UQJ|4.0|(...) It's a standard McCartney pop album that deserves alot more credit than it gets.  Critics really do expect the impossible from McCartney.  This CD really has some very good pop rock on it.  I've been a Macca fan for along time and you've got to learn to expect the unexpected from him, his musical styles change majorly from album to album.  But keep in mind this is no Band on the Run, there are some not so good songs on here....<BR>OFF THE GROUND- A good strong pop rock mid tempo opener. It's got a good catchy melody and a real airy \\"off the ground\\" feel to it. It also has a mean electric guitar.<BR>LOOKING FOR CHANGES- A song McCartney sings about animal rights.  Another rocker with hot electric guitar, a good solid riff that'll hook you to it... if you can get used to the lyrics.<BR>HOPE OF DELIVERENCE- This was a huge commercial hit, which i personally do not care for.  It has a cool steel guitar solo though its largely an acoustic song.<BR>MISTRESS AND MAID- Here we come to the first really bad song.  He co wrote it with MacManus.... just go ahead and skip over it.<BR>I OWE IT ALL TO YOU- A very nice ballad type song. It's definantly worth a listen.<BR>BIKER LIKE AN ICON- LOL! What were you smokin when you wrote this one McCartney?  A good funny novelty piece with a catchy bass line but the lyrics are just........INSANE!!!<BR>PEACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD- A good groovy boogy song.  Definantly happy and upbeat. Don't skip over it.<BR>GOLDEN EARTH GIRL-One of Paul's most over looked ballads.  Its got a very nice piano accomp. though the lyrics are k i nd o f w e i r d.?(Eggshell fish in a sunbeam)!@?<BR>THE LOVERS THAT NEVER WERE- Sounds like this one could be in a movie, listen to it.<BR>GET OUT OF MY WAY- Oh yah!! McCartney at his rock n' roll best, screamin' out \\"get out of my way, get out of my life, i don't need anybody but my woman tonight\\" classic 50's rock. Sweet.<BR>WINEDARK OPEN SEA-Another McCartney love song.  Gotta be get tired of them but you should still listen to it, its a good one.<BR>C'MON PEOPLE- Very  John Lennon style. Definantly not my favorite on the CD but no less a good closing song.<br />Remember that these are just my personal opinions on this album.  And I'm saying you should definantly give it a listen.. it measures up to be just as good as Flaming Pie. To bad it's out of print in the US.
0553812173|3.0|Gradens of the Moon is ambition embodied: we follow about a dozen concurrent story lines that twine intermittently. Among Erikson's entourage of characters are gods, demons, and creatures born from a febrile imagination: Hounds, ravens of enormous intelligence and size, and T'lan Imass, ancient creatures wielding inscrutable but formidable powers. Now, all this is a heady mix, and makes for heady reading. Advantages and disadvantages abound.<br />First, the concurrent story lines provide the novel with an extraordinary scope--but its mere size at times proves unwieldly, and prevents deep commisseration with the characters. While the originality of Erikson's plot is unquestionable, certain problems of logic rear, some of these already announced by astute reviewers: the notion of releasing an uncontrollable, well-nigh unstoppable enemy in hopes it will battle another uncontrollabe, well-nigh unstoppable enemy tests the bounds of credulity. Perhaps Erikson's defining characteristic is, in fact, the plethora of uncontrollable, well-nigh unstoppable forces that machinate and scheme: the Empire as a whole, Anomander Rake, a spattering of gods, High Mages that can topple cities and possess demon familiars that can topple cities, and so on. Fantasy novels embedded with sorcerers of immense power always must solve the conundrum--what purpose can others have in the wake of such irrepresible might?<br />Second, Erikson's prose has wild swings in quality. At times it is staggeringly effective: <br />&quot;As he walked, the chaotic dance of his arms was timed to catch apples flying from baskets, pastries leaping from trays, chocolate-covered cherries plucked from pans, all moving so swiftly as to be no more than blurs dodging bodies in their path... He strode on, a connoisseur of edible dlicacies of a hundred cultures, an expression of sated contentment on his round face.&quot; This author screams talent with lush prose that still manages economy of expression. <br />But occasionally risible dialogue mars his text: &quot;I thought it might be you,&quot; Hairlock sniggered. &quot;Isn't vengeance sweeter than honey, eh, Captain? Your death will be long, protracted and very, very painful. Imagine my pleasure at seeing you like this!&quot; These agrressions are simply too obvious to be taken seriously. 'Protracted' is synonymous with 'long' in this context, and the intelligent audience that Erikson's series caters to is more impressed with subtlety, especially when it is wed to villainy. And Erikson is often lazy with throwaway phrases like 'here and there', 'this and that', and the incessant grins and smiles of characters.<br />But enough criticisms. That Erikson has crafted so serpentine a plot, with half a dozen truly interesting characters among its large cast, is remarkable in itself. His imagination is wondrous. And the intermittent passages of sparkling prose are to this bibliophile worth the price of the book itself. If this is a flawed book, its comprehensiveness, its detail, and its sheer ambition have convinced me--along with the other intelligent reviews that decorate this site. Apparently the series only improves. And if GOTM as Erikson's debut is any indication, we are in for a sumptuous tale indeed.
B00000JLWW|2.0|The historical story of RMS Titanic is both tragic and fascinating; a testament of man's arrogance and of the consuming power of natural forces when juxtaposed with man's puny scientific achievements. Primarily the history of the Titanic is a tragedy. Not only from the standpoint that so many died but that the majority of those who died were poor.<br /><br />Taken at face value, the history is so replete with human interest, with character and with raw story that a simple and accurate telling of the events that culminated in the Titanic tragedy would have made a more compelling, more interesting and more appropriate movie than what James Cameron brought to the screen as TITANIC.<br /><br />Yes, this is definitely a disaster movie.  It might be more accurate to say that it is a disastrous movie.  And that's just the movie itself.  Never mind the disgusting insult to those that died.  They deserved something far more accurate and far better than this. Cameron irresponsibly and insultingly takes this marvelous and disturbing history, guts it and distills it down to nothing more than a pathetic, nudity-riddled chick flick complete with an unnecessary romance story and all of what goes with it. In the end this movie is so shallow that you couldn't sink a teacup in it, let alone the greatest ship ever built.<br /><br />While it's laughable that this movie garnered so many Academy Awards (Best Picture among them) the special effects of how Titanic sank were definitely worthy of the Oscar and are well worth a watch. Skip the rest.
630218021X|4.0|This is probably Ken Russell's best film after &quot;Women In Love.&quot; It is truly unfortunate that only a pan-and-scan video is available; the brilliant opening &quot;Winter Carnival&quot; sequence, which introduces all the main characters - AND establishes their relationships, without a word of dialogue! - is particularly damaged by the cropped aspect ratio. Chamberlain was never better, and still in his physical prime, and Jackson is briliant as always. This is worth the price just for the drunken honeymoon train-ride scene. Why in God's name this isn't on DVD is beyond me- Chamberlain's fans alone would put this one in the black! Hellooo MGM, WB or whoever owns this title now, we're waiting for a widescreen transfer!

The person who gave it to me said I would find myself referring back to it every 5 years of my life.<br />Maybe it is me, but this book did not enlighten me.  I made through 60 pages and realized it was just not the book for me. I found it long winded and I kept asking myself why I felt the need to go on.<br />I finally had to good sense to stop.   I felt like I was reading something written by an insane person that was projecting his own reality onto the world.
B000002LIX|4.0|The whole &quot;second side&quot; is brilliant (from Three Days onwards).  The first side is more about headbanging, and took awhile to grow on me when I first heard it back when it was released.   Ain't No Right and No One is Leaving seem kind of thrown together even though they have good energy and the rhythm section rocks.   The chord changes and arrangement sound rushed, like they were written in the studio on coke or something.  Nonetheless, this album was pretty ground breaking even though it signaled the death of alternative music in tandem with Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot;.   Within the next 2 or 3 years, &quot;alternative&quot; simply became mainstream rock or metal and lost most of its appeal (see Bush, Creed, etc, ad infinitum).
B00009V7RF|5.0|The group Black-Eyed Peas has become an authority in music. You can't help listening to their songs. And you want it to play and play again. <br />The songs I love are:<br />1. Hands Up<BR>2. Labor Day (It's a Holiday)<BR>3. Let's Get Retarded<BR>4. Hey Mama<BR>5. Shut Up<BR>6. Smells Like Funk<BR>7. Latin Girls<BR> 8. Sexy<BR>9. Fly Away<BR>10. Boogie That Be<BR>11. APL Song<BR>12. Anxiety<BR>13. Where Is the Love?<BR> <BR>Where is the love is really my favorite. I am not heartbroken, but when you hear the song, you can relate yourself and even feel every line on it. Everyone of us is looking for a real love...and real love comes on the way. But hey, the singer-artist Pineda is a Filipino who migrated to the USA. He was a teenager then and I am sure he missed his family here. Love in this song is the love he's been looking for his mother who is far from him.<br />Then the APL song which is sung in Filipino, one of the national languages in the Philippines after English. <BR>This song is talking about the Philippines. Pineda narrates the ongoing situation of his country. This is also an eye-opener of the war veterans who are living in the US after the world war II and they are left alone in a small apartment. <br />APL song has been played in 2003, and only a few Filipinos have appreciate it. But when they learned that Pineda is a Filipino, now they appreciate it to the most.<br />Whether one of the Black Eyed-Peas is a Filipino, their songs are really real-life situations. You can't help but be allured and sing the songs!
0060920084|4.0|This is a very funny book. Bryson's two road trips, covering 38 of the 48 continental United States, wind through many famous sites and cities as well as many small towns and endless boring miles in the Midwest. He takes these routes in search of the idyllic small towns he remembers from his youth and imagines, but instead finds that the strip malls, fast food joints and cheap hotels that dominate larger towns have taken hold everywhere. His descriptions of the people and places he visits are hilarious and I think it is too bad some reviewers take his comments personally. He was certainly exaggerating and generalizing his statments for humor, but that makes it entertaining. Certainly he comes off a bit whiny and sometimes mean, but that is Bryson's style and the way he writes all of his books. This is the most enjoyable Bryson book I've read to this point and I think anyone who has ever taken a car trip will appreciate it. It is excellent summer vacation reading.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Actually, Britney's album is kinda great. I like her MTV too and her songs are really great. When you hear it, you can really relate it in your life.<br />In the Zone has an effect to what is happening of our teenage lives today. <br />It is must for you and me.
B000002KO3|5.0|Everyone remembers where they were when they first heard the news of the murder of John Lennon, the taking down of the Berlin Wall, and the attacks of September 11. I believe that everyone remembers where they were when they first heard Talking Heads &quot;Once In A Lifetime&quot;; it seems that historic. <br />Several of the songs on REMAIN IN LIGHT, in hindsight, seem prophetic. Written and produced during the tail-end of the 1970s, it nonetheless anticipated the empty yuppie-angst of the mid-80s. It calls into question the extreme materialism and extraordinary self-absorption that the decade would come to be defined as. This is especially true of &quot;Overload&quot; and, of course, &quot;Once In A Lifetime&quot;.<br />But even musically it anticipated the world music movement that was maybe just burgeoning, as well as the club sound--which is not to be confused with disco. Certainly the very sound of REMAIN IN LIGHT would influence several musicians, so maybe it was more a precedent-setting experience rather than prophetic. Hard to tell. Still, looking back, or listening back rather, REMAIN IN LIGHT is the defining moment of 80s music. So where were  you when you first heard David Byrne's mid-sentence lyric, &quot;And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack&quot;?
B0000AUHPG|3.0|Once Upon a Time in the West is a parody of the classic western. It is very slow-moving, like the Mississippi River. Exquisitely deliberate like cold caramel. And exaggerated in every instance. I found myself laughing at the extravagence of everything - extravagent pauses, soaring Italian operatic lyrics, ridiculous caricatures of railroad men, villians and heroes.<br />There isn't a theatrical device or worn cliche which is left out of this film.<br />All in all, it is tedious and boring. The script is well beneath the talents of Henry Fonda and Jason Robards and other star cast<br />members.
B00000K3G8|5.0|In 1984, I saw Jonathan Demme's &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; four separate times--this was not unusual for any Talking Heads fan. So when the soundtrack was released, I rushed to get a copy. It's not hard to imagine my disappointment to find that it only contained nine songs from the film. Nine! Where were &quot;Heaven&quot;, &quot;This Must Be the Place&quot; and the Tom Tom Club's &quot;Genius of Love&quot;? This soundtrack was nothing less than a gyp!<br />Now, almost two decades later, is this new edition which contains so many of the tunes that I found unforgiveably left off the original! The sound is crisp and true. Without trying to overemphasize the importance of Talking Heads, this documentary of a truly great tour will reveal why this band had such a following, and why its music is still influencing the music of today.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|The anti here genre of movies was always a favorite of mine.  Main reason being, is that if you look in the average movie or story, the good guys tend to be dull, and the bad guys are the most interesting characters in the movie.  Examples of anti heroes are Snake Plisken(Escape from New York), Jack Carter(Get Carter), or Porter(Payback).  These weren't heroes with lofty ideals or alturistic goals, these were villians that happened to have similar goals to the protagonists or were coherced in to helping a good cause.  Riddick is now added to this line of anti heroes.<br />The plot is relatively simplistic, and would probably fail under scrutiny, but it isn't the point of the movie.  The idea is that this is some sort of interstellar bus/plane travelling through an unpopulated part of the galaxy.  They get hit by a rain of small meteors and the ship starts to go down.  The co pilot attempts to jettison the passenger section to save ship, but the system jams and the ship crashes on a seemingly unihabited planet.<br />The planet is a surreal landscape, there is more than one sun, and it creates a strange surreal lighting, nothing seems quite real.  The planet is a desert and desolate, nothing but rocks and sand for as long as they can see.  When they make stock of who survived they find that they have two passengers that were unexpected, a marshal of some sort, and an escaped convict named Riddick.  An almost inhuman predator that had been recently recaptured and was being brought back into incarceration.  <br />Upon some exploration of the planet they find that it wasn't completely deserted.  They find a large collection of bones, like an elepahnt graveyard for some giant creatures.  As well as what appears to be a science station, seemingly deserted for years.  This seems like a boon since they can use some of the lefteover equipment to reapair a ship.  But three things happen that radically change their plans.  One is Riddick escapes and is on the prowl.  Two, is that the previous lifeforms on the planet were wiped out by a vicious flying creature that inhabits the planet in swarms.  Three, the creatures are highly photosensitive, but the planet is shifting, and the sun is going down.  With this planet, that could mean weeks.<br />This was a suprisingly good movie.  Not one that you worry on the plot or dialogue, but to sit back and enjoy the ride.  Diesel is great as the predator diesel.  Seemingly more like a jungle cat on the prowl than an escaped convict.  He really looks like he is toying with the survivors.  Not trying to kill or hurt them, but playing strange games that serve no purpose aside from enjoyment.<br />the rest of the cast is a bit cliche, but they are just vehicles for the main character and the story.  Which is similar to a James Cameron film, they land in a dark place, and things keep getting darker.  Some faces arer recognizable from the sci fi genre, noticably Claudia Black from Farscape fame.  They aren't bad, but they are obviously just backdrops and victims.  The alien species is interesting and vicious, and the situation created by them gives the movie a desperate feel.<br />I wouldn't rate this movie as perfect, but fun.  It is a good action flick and, so far, Vin Diesel's best work yet.
6304698623|5.0|A Little Princess is a fast-paced movie about a young girl who's father must go off to war. Sarah (the Little Princess) must cope with the fact that she must leave her home in India and go the strict boarding school for girls in New York, where her deceased mother once attended. <BR>   Sarah turns out to be a trouble maker and ends up almost being sent to jail. <BR>   However, she gets out of it and I promise I won't give away the ending. <BR>   We have owned this movie form almost 10 years and I don't think we'll ever get tired of it.
B0000041ZT|5.0|It's too bad that Riccardo Chailly and the Concertgebouw haven't recorded more Shostakovich (perhaps because Haitink did), since this project is pretty winning.  As several other reviewers have noted, however, the term &quot;jazz&quot; here is a bit of a misnomer.  Some of the music is lighter than usual for the composer, but anyone expecting to find even as much as what Bernstein created in his &quot;jazz moments&quot; is likely to be a bit disappointed.  <br />But never mind, the recording is superb.  Shostakovich's &quot;Piano Concerto No. 1,&quot; for piano, trumpet and strings, is one of his most wittily engaging works, and Ronald Brautigam (piano) and Peter Masseurs (trumpet) sound wonderful.  The final movement is fairly hilarious, despite a somewhat introspective middle movement that precedes it.  The second of the two &quot;Jazz Suites&quot; has the dark little waltz made famous by its appearance in Kubrick's &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot; (This is the very recording used in the film.)<br />As if all this weren't enough, the concert closes with the composer's hilarious take on &quot;Tea for Two&quot; called &quot;Tahiti Trot.&quot;  Its sparkling insouciance is a gentle reminder that despite the composer's anguish and pain, he still had wit to spare.  <br />Terrific playing, terrific sound, and lovely cover art, too.  One of Chailly's best, most imaginative recordings with this orchestra.
B000002KKS|5.0|MY OPINION-To me Black Sabbath has and always will be Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill. My first response to this album was &quot;Crap. It's not the same without Ozzy&quot;. But my closedmindedness (if thats a word) soon fell away and I opened my eyes to a truely awesome album. All the songs are masterfully done and the songwriting is the best since Sabotage. On to the review<br />1.Neon Knights-The concept of this song is weird in my opinion. One thing Dio added to the songs was a mystic, midievil feel to them. This song proves that right away. 9/10<br />2.Children of the Sea-2nd best song on the album. Some of the lyrics are not really that good (Then we did the demon dance and rushed to Nevermore)but still an awesome song. 10/10<br />3.Lady Evil-Strange, yet the music is so good that it's overlookable. 9/10<br />4.Heaven and Hell-The single best song on the album. The riff is deathly catchy (even if it is sorta reminiscent of the Snowblind riff) 10/10<br />5.Wishing Well-Not the best song by far, but still a decent rocker that'll get ya goin. 8/10<br />6.Die Young-Amazing song. The intro thingy is really cool and the main riff is great. Probably the 3rd best on the album. 9/10<br />7.Walk Away-The riff is good and sorta sounds just a fuzz like Marilyn Manson's song Lunchbox (to me anyway). Not the best song on the album, but still good. Probably the weekest song though. 7/10<br />8.Lonely is the Word-Sounds sort of generic, but the riff is good. Once again, not the best song but not the worst. 8/10<br />BOTTOM LINE:This album should appeal to everyone who is even remotely interested in metal/rock music. To everyone who think Sabbath couldn't make it without Ozzy, listen to this album and tell yourself that again. Sounds stupid to say that dont it?<br />Rock on
B00028HBKM|5.0|If you have read and understand the gospel you cant help but appreciate this explicit depiction of the last 12 hours of our lords life. I dont quite understand where all the controversy comes from. It represents the gospel. If anyone can show me where the gospel doesn't speak about the scourging of christ then please by all means prove me wrong.<BR>When I first saw this film, I wasnt quite sure what to expect from Mel Gibson. I guess a somewhat sugar coating, many of the other biblical films made have given.<BR>If you know the gospel then you would know that the last hours of jesus' life were brutal.<BR>I can absolutely appreciate the tender moments placed in the film, the flash back to the sermon on the mount being one in particular. As tender moments with his mother.Though I have heard Mel say that he placed certain scene's as a place to escape to from the violence, but for me it was those scene's that brought the most emotion out of me. This film is truely like no other, if you havent seen this film, I recommend reading the gospel from the book of mathew on, so you will have a clear understanding of the life and ministries of Jesus Christ. And from that you will come to understand the message of love that he adamantly preached,and the ultimate sacrifice of giving his human life to save us from our sins.<BR>After and during this film, I could do nothing but weep. I Wept out of complete humility and devotion.<BR>Its a very moving peace of work! A job very well done by Mel Gibson!

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Mer De Noms was one of the greatest debut albums for any band, let alone that of A Perfect Circle.  I saw them preform a couple years back, and you relize when you watch them just how much they are really doing.<BR>    That being said, i was skeptical when this album first came out, thinking it wouldnt live up to what Mer De Noms had planted in the music world.  And at first listen, some of the songs may not jump out to you as they might have with Mer De Noms.  But you need to stop the comparison there.  This album is not on the same judging scale as Mer De Noms and doesn't intend to.  I don't even think about Mer De Noms when this album is playing.<BR>    The songs are more complex and for the most part quieter and have more depth.  <BR>     <BR>    4.5/5 &quot;The Package&quot; is a great opener about a drug addict looking for his next fix.  It sets the tone for the album, and you soon realize what the album will unveil at second listen.<br />    5/5 &quot;Weak And Powerless&quot; is a great song, intended for radio play as a single.  Like &quot;Judith&quot; from Mer De Noms, it might grab the most attention, but isn't the best song on the record.<br />    5/5 &quot;The Noose&quot; in my opinion this is the greatest song on the record and second best song APC has written, trailing &quot;3 Libras&quot;, and they are quite similar in tone.  But i love the hard drum beat that enters in with the bridge.<br />   5/5 &quot;Blue&quot; is another amazing song with a lot of depth and the bass playing on this song is great.  The verse really lures you in and then the chorus completely envelopes you, and the more you listen the more you really hear what they are all doing as musicians and it gains more respect as a wonderful song.<br />   3.5/5 &quot;Vanishing&quot; it maybe filler, because it doesn't have much meaning but it still is in perfect place for this album.  Somewhat of an interlude and a break from all the other songs that really work well together.  At first listen you may not like it, but the more you listen the more you'll enjoy the musicianship on this song.<br />   4/5 &quot;The Stranger&quot; this song begins to bring you back into the album after the break of &quot;Vanishing&quot; it does a great job at bringing back attention to the lyrics which are sung softly and sweetly, almost hypnotic.<br />   5/5 &quot;The Outsider&quot; this is the hardest song on the record.  A great song for anyone who loved Mer De Noms, this is probably the only song on the album that could have been on the Mer De Noms album.  The lyrics on this song are amazing and are top notch on this record.  This is my second favorite song on the record.<br />   2/5 &quot;Crimes&quot; the drums sound good, but there is no point to this song and any listener that is not a diehard APC fan or a fan of listening to drum beats will not enjoy this song.<br />   2/5 &quot;Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is a song you think will grow on you.  But it doesn't, the lyrics are nice and the vocals are great, but the style of playing is in no way APC and is not wanted by the listener.  &quot;Crimes&quot; gives you the feeling that the next song will be really hard and a good track but &quot;Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is a huge let down.  In fact, you might find yourself hoping they break out into a drum solo.  Which they don't.<br />   4.5/5 &quot;Pet&quot; awesome song, it seems like it should have come after &quot;Crimes&quot; instead of &quot;Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; i really love the song structure on this album.  The ending of the song is the best part.<br />   2/5 &quot;Lullaby&quot; is even worse than &quot;Crimes&quot; and has no place whatsover on this album.  A waste of time.  But that's what its supposed to be, so i guess it does its job.<br />  5/5 &quot;Gravity&quot; exactly what your hoping for in a closer for the album.  This is one of the greatest songs on the album, and reminds you of Mer De Noms, its a good reflection song, with great lyrics about being reborn.<br />This album may have a few songs that are just filler, but you get passed them quickly and love the rest of the album.  This is an amazing album and deserves more credit than its gotten.
B000002JS6|5.0|I look around and I see alot of 4 and 5 star review for this album. This is becasue its hard to find anything bad to say about it. It was the first album with Brian Johnson in the band and he does a great job singing and being more than a serrogate for the late Bon Scott. Angus once again provwes that he is one of the greatest guitar players ever and is among the likes of Hendrix and Van Halen. Overall a great album and probably the best of the 80's.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|What is the title of the music playing when Uma and Daryl Hannah face off in Budd's trailer (both with samurai swords)?? - a reviewer asked. <br />Answer: It's called \\"Silhouette of Doom\\" and it is on the soundtrack Vol. 2. The song slowly buidls to that part however and once it gets there, it quickly ends. The slow first half of this song is also played in the begining part of the film while the Bride is driving and talking to the audience. This is the best track on this disc and the reason for my 4 star rating. <br />Unfortunately, this soundtrack, although good, contains more down tempo and slow tracks, where as the Vol. 1 contains a lot of exciting fast paced music. One song that is NOT on this soundtrack, is the cool retro sounding chase scene that started to play as the Bride and Pai Mei really began to train and work on her fighting skills. While I was in the theatre, this tune really started my feet taping and bought this soundtrack in the hopes of hearing that track...well, it's not here. That song , along with another from Vol. 1 are not on the soundtracks. They're both by Issac Hayes and can be found on his Double Feature CD import soundtrack called \\"Truck Turner//Tough Guys\\". It's for sale here on Amazon as well as iTunes and if you're looking for that killer 1970's blackxploitation sound, then buy that CD soundtrack instead. <br />One other gripe is that a great deal of the soundtrack is nothing but audio cuts from the film.  So, buy it only if you're a really big fan of the series, like me.
B0001XWV12|1.0|I don't know about y'all, but this movie is questionable. It features the hedonistic adventures of teenagers taking a trip to Europe (with absolutely no parental permission and/or awareness.) What does that say about American parenting, huh? Secondly, you observe the protagonist teenager having sex with his German pen-pal, and later on they move in together as dorm-mates. In another words, they become co-habitators. And it is this huge misconception and terrible value that sky-rockets our national divorce rate to about 75%. I don't know what message the producers of this movie are trying to convey to our teenagers; whatever it is, however, let shame be upon them!

1556587864|3.0|We might call this trash, but if we do we'd have to call it very clever trash, the sort of trash one might find dumpster-diving in Beverly Hills.<br />It stars Michael Douglas (who, by the way, has eclipsed the Hollywood power, if not the screen presence, of his dad, Kurt Douglas) and Sharon Stone who, as usual, finds herself in a part that requires that she take off her clothes and spout hard-edged one-liners: she does both with a certain delight that makes us think she is having a good time.<br />He's a San Francisco homicide cop named Nick Curran with some questionable shootings hanging over his head, hence his nickname, \\"Shooter.\\"  She's a rich best-selling trash novelist named Catherine Tramell (pen name Catherine Wolfe) who likes kinky sex and other deviancies.  It seems that her latest boyfriend (depicted in a blood-splattered opening scene) abruptly, shall we say, met his maker while in the arms of Venus, something predicted in Catherine's latest opus.  We are made to believe that she could very well have been that Venus, although of course keeping us in the dark is part of the seduction.<br />Jeanne Tripplehorn plays Beth Garner, police Internal Affairs shrink who just happens to be Nick's latest main squeeze.  It seems that Catherine and Beth had a one-time intimate liaison while undergrads at UC Berkeley.  We are led to believe that she too might have done the killings.<br />So Nick has a choice, whom to believe about who's responsible for all the dead bodies, the blonde Catherine or the brunette Beth?  Both seem a little wacko/sexy.  He tries them both out, and we see a lot of skin and hear a lot of fast breathing, and are kept on the edge of our whoopee cushions until the very end--and after, actually, as though the purveyors were already counting on the sequel.  I am reminded of a lyric from Elvis Costello's \\"Everyday I write the book\\": \\"Even in a world where everyone was equal/I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel.\\"<br />In other words, what this film is about is money--money for the producers, director, actors, crew, etc.  It's an extreme sexploitation thriller diabolically done with absurd plot twists and plenty of dead bodies and some diverting chase scenes (did I mention sex?); indeed I suspect that Basic Instinct will be recognized by future film historians as one of the primo examples of the sex/slasher genre, that is, as soft porn with a sick edge.<br />But wait, why did I watch this?  Uh...Sharon Stone amuses me like a comedic actress, but she ain't exactly funny, is she?<br />Also it's interesting to notice that in these late eighties/early nineties sexploitation flicks it's the women who are the aggressors (I'm thinking also of Single White Female from the same year) while the men play a little tagalong.  Michael Douglas is particularly adept at playing the sort of male who seems natural being dominated by Sharon Stone.<br />Bottom line: mass mind trash, but worth seeing for its ability to define the Hollywood mentality circa 1992.words, what this film is about is money--money for the producers, director, actors, crew, etc.  It's an extreme sexploitation thriller diabolically done with absurd plot twists and plenty of dead bodies and some diverting chase scenes (did I mention sex?); indeed I suspect that Basic Instinct will be recognized by future film historians as one of the primo examples of the sex/slasher genre, that is, as soft porn with a sick edge.<br />But wait, why did I watch this?

B00006RINF|3.0|...Evanescence comparison, though without the former's emotional wreckage. A little more on the metal side than Evanescence, though, and this is what detracts for me. But if you Like traditional metal...they've got some nice things going on. I just kind of wish they'd leave the vocals to the female. Nice layering of melodies, and there's some diverse experimenting peeking through that needs to be followed through with, showing promise.
1592400876|2.0|It is &quot;so American&quot; that this book, a punctuation primer of sorts, is a bestseller. It is filled with punctuation errors. I was an English major, and I'm certainly not an &quot;expert&quot;, but the book is packed with just the type of errors she &quot;objects&quot; to. They aren't hard to find. To list them would take several tedious pages. I think America likes this book because it wants to believe that &quot;educated&quot; Americans are horrified by the sloppy emails,etc. that everybody sends now. &quot;These young people and their rap music and what not, they are destroying our culture.&quot; American culture is always destroying itself; that's just what it does. The people who buy this book are doing a good job themselves.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Usually, I'm not a huge fan of gore-obsessed lyrics.  In fact, I used to hate Cannibal Corpse because I wrote them off as another band who pandered to an audience of pimple-faced teenagers who are so overwhelmed by their feelings of helplessness and inadequacy that they feel compelled to watch horror movies and listen to death metal in order to compensate.  While that very well may be the case, it would be a mistake to hastily write-off Cannibal Corpse.<br /><br />While I might be new to Cannibal Corpse's music, I know good (...) when I hear it.  \\"The Wretched Spawn\\" is a high-speed, adrenaline-fueled, pummeling attack on the senses that presents the perfect blend of technicality and brutality (why the two have to be mutually exclusive in the death metal world, I don't know).  I can't say that the lyrics are the most creative ever, and I can't say that George \\"Corpsegrinder\\" Fisher's vocals set him apart from any other death metal act out there.  I can say that, compared to other death metal albums I own, \\"The Wretched Spawn\\" is by far the most intense.  Every second of the CD is a gut-wrenching thrill ride that will beat you to the ground and keep kicking you until you're curled up and bleeding.  Pick it up, put it in your car stereo, roll the windows down, and go out of your way to pull up next to a sweet old lady with a jesus fish on the back of her car.  A good time is had by all.<br /><br />As for the DVD accompanying the album, it entertains and lends some important insight into the making of \\"The Wretched Spawn,\\" both on a technical and artistic level. Cannibal Corpse is a well-adjusted group of guys living in a tastefully decorated studio house in Texas, making music, cooking out, and having the time of their lives.  They are all articulate, talented musicians who do what they do because \\"the kids love it\\" and it makes them a living.  If you're a closed-minded prick and you  think for one second that these guys sit around watching anatomy videos or beating the crap out of random people as inspiration for their lyrics, you're in for a disappointment.  They do what they do and they sing about what they do because it moves albums.  Don't worry about your kids.  They have fun with the music, bang their heads, and develop an appreciation for the musicianship. Hopefully they don't take the LYRICS too seriously.  It wouldn't make a good court defense.andom people as inspiration for their lyrics, you're in for a disappointment.  They do what they do and they sing about what they do because it moves albums.

0790729628|1.0|Give us a break!  You can see any film several times over and read more into it than really exist.  Maybe the theater release version of \\"Blade Runner\\" might not have been the original story that Ridley Scott wanted but what movie is?<br />So many people are claiming that Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a replicant.  Well, if you want to rewrite the story then be my guest.  Considering that Tyrell, who created these replicants, pointed out to Deckard that: \\"Rachael is an experiment.  Nothing more.\\"<br />Now, how can Deckard not know that he is not a replicant if he was around way before Rachael even existed?  You are making Deckard a very far advance replicant compare to the others including Rachael.<br />I am watching the DVD version of Blade Runner at the same time I am typing this letter.  Memories are the main factor here.  The previous versions of replicant do not have memories of their childhood like Deckard does.  Rachael is an experiment.  She the first replicant to have memories!  Now, why would Tyrell, knowing that Deckard is an replicant lie about Rachael?  Tyrell didn't lie to Roy right before Roy killed him so why would Tyrell lie to Deckard?<br />I don't want to remove the uncut version I would just like to see the original be release on DVD.
B000002J2B|5.0|I know this art work since 1978. At the time I bought also Seconds Out and A Trick of the Tail LP's, which are excellent too (recommended). This album has become my favourite collection of songs as entertained the early adulthood of my life. I have certainly saturated my senses with it (I can not listen to it as frequently as I used to), but it still gives me the goosebumps, especially One for The Vine and Blood on The Rooftops, which are real masterpieces. I dare to say that every human being (maybe other species too) should have the opportunity of listening to these wonders. Steve Hackett is marvellous in the acoustic guitar at Blood on The Rooftops. Phil Collins sings soft and deeply from the heart. The melodies by Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Steve Hackett and Phil Collins are pleasant and transcend any music style to deserve recommendation whichever preferences you do have. Although songs may unravel melancholy sometimes, the melody and playing are magnificent. If I would go back in time to relive my life I should have this in the background for a good part of the travel.
0553278223|3.0|Certainly not. Admittedly there are a few bland points but one must get over the fact that it really _isn't_ a science fiction book. By all means that does not make it bad. Sure, it's off a category or so but that's beside the point. To judge we must judge by quality and meaning, not simply a genre miscalculation.<br />The Martian Chronicles portrays human behavior, ideas, and even fears. There are bland chapters and there are really exciting chapters. It's the feeling in the book that counts. Most books that involve other planets focus on technology, war, or a conflict that is external to the inner most thoughts and feelings of human beings. Bradbury changes that with his unique style in The Martian Chronicles. It doesn't ruin literature with modern literary devices that are overused or overanalyzed, yet applies them when appropriate - without disturbing the quality of the book.<br />Unfortunately it's rather rigid. From discussion with others about the book, you either like it or you dislike it. There isn't a middle ground for The Martian Chronicles. It's worth a read so if possible rent it at your local library. I ended up buying a copy because I find some of the stories rather interesting. Try to make sure to obtain the book that has all the chapters - since I recall in a few versions there is a lack of a certain chapter.<br />Final rating: 3.5 - It's a nice read but isn't a MUST have. The bland chapters are in bad places - it sometimes makes it seem like the book is dragging on instead of progressing smoothly. Overall, I can find enjoyment with little qualms.
B000002UB3|3.0|Despite the factual inaccuracies posted in recent reviews, I find the perceptions of this album by people who were not around when the Beatles were recording and releasing albums somewhat entertaining.  A case in point, as for Abbey Road being &quot;the climactic ending that everyone expected&quot;, this was not the case.  First, the break up was not expected when it was announced in April 1970, much less in 1969 when Abbey Road was released.  Second, although it seems retrospectively simple to state that Abbey Road was the &quot;farewell album&quot;, again, this was not the actual experience.  The Beatles were on the road to recovery out of the studio dominated, light pop, orchestra backed fare of the Rubber Soul through Sgt. Pepper period when they once again pulled out the guitars and recorded 1968's White Album.  The next release, 1969's Abbey Road, was received as a good follow through, absent the magic of the early years but better than the 1966-67 period.  The final release was 1970's &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which I like more than &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. <br />In summary, the real experience was not &quot;Abbey Road&quot; as a farewell album.  The farewell period as experienced by the public was the release of &quot;Let It Be&quot;, as singles &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot; were released, and the band announcing its breakup.  As much as I like &quot;Let It Be&quot;, I would agree that the band went out on a high note, but not because of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

B000002C1W|4.0|All in all, A Momentary Lapse Of Reason stands as a pretty decent David Gilmour solo record with the Pink Floyd name tacked on for the sake of album sales.  I have no problem with this.  Gilmour's amazing guitar work was partially responsible for the five star ratings I gave every Floyd project from Meddle to The Final Cut.  The problem is, so was Roger Waters needle sharp lyrical wit and distinctive vocals.  In the post-split era, Roger has been the one whose creative abilities have been stifled, largely because he needs Gilmour's guitar to keep everyone from realizing how depressing the stuff he writes generally is.  Unlikely as it seems and probably is, I look forward to the day that Roger, Dave and the little Floyds can bury the hatchet and get back to combining their talents instead of using them to launch barbs at the opposing camp.  As long as the acrimony remains, we're all poorer in the long run.
0671027387|5.0|Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton, an employee of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), is used to absorbing complex data and repackaging it into digestible bits for consumption by the likes of Zach Herney, the President of the United States. As it happens, Rachel is also the estranged daughter of Democratic senator and presidential candidate Sedgewick Sexton, who is running against the incumbent on an anti-NASA platform. When NASA makes a (conveniently-timed) discovery of unparalleled importance deep in the Arctic circle, inside a three-hundred-foot-thick ice floe on the coast of Ellesmere Island, President Herney shrewdly recruits Rachel to corroborate the find and summarize the science behind it for his staff. Rachel's involvement in the project, however, which requires observation of the find in situ, plunges her into a nightmarish race for survival after she and a small band of civilian scientists stumble upon certain irregularities in NASA's evidence.<br /><br />Deception Point is yet another taut, intelligent thriller from the keyboard of Dan Brown, who, like his protagonist, excels at transforming complex information into digestible prose. This is top-notch escapist fiction. Put it on your summer reading list.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece

B000002J1Y|5.0|I bought this, my first YES album twice on vinyl - I wore the first one out.  I'm listening to it as I write, in order that I might compare it with the gig at Manchester I went to last friday, and the boys have not lost their touch.  This live-album gig could've been recorded last week.  It has a raw energy typical of the band, and on vinyl at least has that warm tone that CD's seem to lack.  I've been enjoying the music of Yes since 1972, and I still think that this is the best album they ever made. &quot;Wurm&quot; as an end-piece to &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; is, was, and always will be my favourite YES track.  Some beautiful guitar work, especially on the classical-medieval-Spanish sounding &quot;Mood for a day&quot;, leading nicely into Rick Wakemans &quot;Six wives of Henry VIII&quot;, which, I have to admit, is not to everyones palate - but don't let that put you off, Rick acquits himself admirably elsewhere on this triple album (or double CD), and demonstrates beyond any doubt why he is considered the greatest rock keyboard player in the world.<br />Jon's distinctive vocal style never seems to suffer the abuse of the years, belting out the favourites to a loyal and expansive fan base to this day. You wouldn't know that there are  two drummers playing different tracks on this album, which is testament to how tight and professional they all are.  And I'm an ex-pro drummer, so I know what to look for...<br />The album opens with a classical piece by Stravinky - an extract from &quot;The Firebird Suite&quot;, and it's nice to see they're still using it at live gigs. Kinda sets the mood...<br />In summary, for those new to YES, and seeking a good introduction, or those wishing to re-acquaint themselves with their youth, this is a damn fine album not to be overlooked, less of a purchase, more of an investment.
B0001ENYKS|1.0|Do not buy this horrible cd. Everytime i see there single on MTV or hear it on the radio i want to shoot myself in the face. How can people swallow this crap. You might as well be listening to Britney, Christina, or Jessica Simpson. If you like the strokes or marron 5 go buy this listen to it. Then go buy something worth listening to.
B000094HMU|4.0|Certainly I found this an enjoyable night's viewing, and rewatchable. The production is appropriately spectacular, the score frizzes with the excitement it should, and the principals parts are all taken by stars.<br />Leona Mitchell sings a wonderful Liu, shading her tone beautifully and floating the high notes as any worthwhile Liu should.<br />Eva Marton has a big voice that would have been great live but by 1988 had developed a judder in her voice that recording shows up glaringly. Her high notes sometimes squall - something hard to square with the idea of a sexually irresistable ice princess, whose top notes should be clear and, well, icy.<br />I found Domingo's Calaf is enjoyable enough but Chris' reservations are not without warrant. Paul Plishka makes a good Timur and Ping, Pang and Pong fuss about as they should.<br />All in all, a performance that I am happy to have, but would be grateful for a better one.<br />Sound DTS 5.1; Dolby 5.1 and PCM Stereo. Picture 4:3. Subtitles Italian; English; German; French; Spanish; Chinese. 132 mins.
B000003TA4|5.0|First of all I don't think this album is that great.  I've listened to it a few times, it's mediocre.  Two, maybe three stars in my opinion.  But the reason I'm giving this 5 stars is to spite AFI K James.  Some idiot who has reviewed this album at least 10 times, and givin it one star every time.  Don't worry about not finding his reviews, because I'm sure everyday for the rest of his life he review about how &quot;Kurt Nobrain&quot;(As he likes to call him. A name that when heared of Kurt Cobain even thought was funny) has corrupted america's youth, and how it inspired Nu-Metal.  Both is true, but you don't need to state it 15 times, once is enough.  And the Darkness aren't going to save rock.  Sure, they have solo's, but not many other mainstream bands do, and I don't see a rock revolution coming anytime soon.  If you still haven't read one of AFI K James's reviews scroll down a little, and you find one, and another, and another, and another, and another, proving this guy has absolutely no life, and feels proud about bashing a guy that's been dead 10 years. But hey, whatever helps him sleep at night. I believe that he has single handedly brought this albums average review down from 4 and a half stars to just 4 stars(Which it still doesn't deserve, but that not the point)  But hey, whatever helps him sleep at night.  Oh! Kurt Nobrain, how original.

B0001XAOLQ|4.0|This review will attempt to assist those who already own the Director's Cut (or Superbit version), but who are thinking about also buying the newer &quot;Original Uncut Version&quot; (293 minutes on 2 DVDs).<br />The first thing you should know is that the English dub has been largely redone; if you are familiar with the Director's Cut dialogue, you will immediately notice that the English dub's script has been changed in many places within the Uncut Version.  In particular, the saltier comments throughout the movie have been deleted and replaced with much more 'polite' translations.  Moreover several of the characters (Werner the war correspondent, Kriechbaum the Navigator, the boat's second-in-command [whom is referred to as \\"Number One\\"], as well as the comical red-haired Second Officer, etc.) have received new voices in the English dub (if only in select places), and their scripts have been changed in numerous instances as well.  I raise this as a concern because I realize diehard fans may find these (sometimes unnecessary) dialogue changes irritating.  This is the main flaw of this edition, in my opinion.<br />While the Uncut Version soundtrack includes new sound effects, and adds frequent narration in old footages areas (largely excerpts from Werner's diary), short pieces of the new footage have not been remastered and look very grainy.   Most of the new footage is however seamless and not of unacceptable quality (contra another reviewer).  The sections that have been neglected are mainly external shots of the uboat -- in one such instance an obvious blue line spans the vertical width of the screen for about 20-30 seconds.<br />The new footage that appears in the Uncut Version is not simply superfluous addition either, but in a few instances actually clarifies or adds completely new elements to the Director's Cut storyline (I won't ruin that for you, suffice to say that some very interesting plot elements are introduced in this newer edition). This cut is alsomuch more pointed in depicting the stress, paranoia, poor morale, and sheer boredom of the crew, who are shown praying, making mistakes, complaining, and doing many stupid things just to pass the time and ease the strain of being a submariner.  Of interest is the enthusiasm that the crew eventually displays at the prospect of going into battle: not because that is what they have trained to do, but because anything is preferable to the endless waiting and resulting apathy between enemy contacts.  Numerous conversations between various characters have been added, and minor characters that didn't make it into the Director's Edition appear in the Uncut Version.  A few treats exist as well, such as a shot where the Second Officer can be more clearly seen using a Kreigsmarine four-rotor ENIGMA machine to decode a transmission.  Most importantly of all, the new footage emphasizes the sense of watching the story unfold through the eyes of the war correspondent, which is what Director Wolfgang Peterson originally intended.  The new footage adds considerably to the picture's atmosphere, and contributes important characterization -- particularly for Johann the Chief Engineer, the second-in-command, and Grade, the Chief of the Boat.<br />German with English subtitles is the default option, but an English dub with French subtitles is also available.  The English track has been upgraded to Dolby 5.1.<br />This 2-DVD Uncut Version is highly recommended, but isn't for everyone -- note that it is deliberately aimed at the fan base. This special-interest group is likely the only one this version of the film will please.  If you've never seen Das Boot, borrow a friend's copy of the shorter Director's Cut first; when you've cultivated an appreciation for this benchmark in WWII filmmaking, come back and get this edition.  I would not recommend buying this version if you've never seen the movie -- it might turn you off due to its sheer length and relatively slower pace.  Neither shouldthe fan looking solely for special features purchase this Uncut Version - the featurette entitled: \\"The Making of Das Boot: Behind the Scenes\\" is a little over seven (7) minutes long, and is mainly a justification for the re-release of the full length cut.<br />A member of the Das Boot `cult' would be very pleased to see the extra footage in this Uncut Version.  If you're a diehard fan, don't think twice; I bought mine even after having read the more negative reviews here.  Four stars given for the substantive quality and importance of the new footage to the overall picture; the image quality and sound in places is not perfect, and there are no new special features worthy of the name, so this cut cannot receive five stars.  Since you are willing to sit through close to 5 hours of Das Boot anyway, the instances of grainy new footage shouldn't overwhelm you.  In all, the extra tidbits (in my estimation) are worth the money.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Well then... I can easily say i once liked this band. I would remember times when i could sing along to these songs, but now i can easily say that you can get sick of this music pretty quick. It took ME but 3 months to cast this band aside. You can buy this album if you want, to maybe listen to it before it goes stale.<br />This band's style is just such that if you listen to it enough, you will probably become very agitated. I listened to it for about 2 hours once and discovered myself coming out of a deep feel of impression to realize myself into a migrane. This band mixes far too many different genres into one style, and you will easily get annoyed after a while. Go ahead, be my guest, buy this album. No one's stopping you. Just remeber that in the long run, there is a slight chance that you will regret it.

B0001MDPV8|5.0|Nas' Illmatic album is nabbed as a classic and a classic it is.  This remixed version of this incredible album is tight.  Nas is one of the best lyricists in the game and has ten years under his belt and still making it hot.  The new stuff on the second disc is really good too.  Nas has still got it.  Nas is truly in it to save the music and make the real music and not all of this stuff about their rims and jewelry, that's what makes him an elite rapper.  Big ups to Nas and this &quot;new&quot; joint.
B00005JM20|4.0|for a comedy, Johnny English has some pretty good action sequences. movie isn't hilarious, but it's entertaining.  <BR>and like someone else said, some of the jokes do get old at times, but it's still a good movie.  <br />and with a secret spy agent name like Johnny English, you can't go wrong. i LOVE that name.  also has good acting from singer Natalie Imbruglia and John Malkovich, who plays the villian, Pascal Sauvage.  <br />movie only runs about an hour and a half, but DVD includes deleted scenes, one of which they definetly should have left in...LOL, spy tips, quiz on the movie, and an awsome movie character profiles.<br />again, movie isn't hilarious, but it's good and enjoyable.<BR>i really hope they continue the Johnny English story with a part 2. special features also includes a making of the Johnny English feature that tells of the origin of the Johnny English story.
B00003CXCT|3.0|For the prequels, Lucas has relied on too much imagination from the actors.  They have to act at invisible objects which are later turned into CG creatures and effects.  Compare these conversations (Obi-Wan and the alien chef in Attack of the Clones, any conversation with Jar Jar, Obi-Wan's conversation with the clone-making aliens) with any scene from Lord of the Rings involving Gollum.  See the difference?  I've noticed that most people who say that the fans are 'whining' about the Sp Ed's also say that they were too young to have seen the originals.  That's the difference here:  we are watching our memories die.  They are different movies now.  Is 2001: A Space Oddesy a terrible movie because Kubrick didn't get to add new effects, or does Casablanca seem fake because the squibs of those days don't compare with today's stunt work, or is Rear Window 'out dated,' (by the way, if you dis these movies, then you are not a movie fan and you do not understand the storytelling proccess) or does Michaelangelo's David seem primitive compared to Henry Moore's works because it's older?  The answer to these questions is no, because they are established works of art and their creators display their prowess of the medium in each work.  The original, unaltered versions of Star Wars are just the same: they were film making at its finest.  Lucas had a very small budget for A New Hope and it became the standard to which every film maker tried to reach for the next 20 something years, in effects, story and appeal.  My point in mentioning the works of past artists is this:  You can't change your work after you've displayed it.  Anyone who has taken an art class understands this.  You only make it worse if you do.  So anyone who says the original versions of Star Wars aren't all they are cracked up to be, is too immature and unlearned to understand.<br />---------BUT----------<br />There is a commentary on each disk by Lucas, Carrie Fischer and sound effects man, Ben Burtt (If you've never heard Ben talking about his work, you're very unfortunate.  The man is a genius!)<BR>There is the feature called \\"The Birth of the Lightsabre\\" which should be very interesting.  Then there is all of the new footage that has never been seen by the public.  Then it is on DVD.  It could be priced a lot higher than forty dollars, but it's not.  I say that should make us, the die-hard Star Wars fans of the originals, who are very irate at the idea of the special editions, consider buying this set.  I know that we will be contributing to Lucas' promise to never release the originals by giving him money, but we can't take the chance that he might stick to his guns.  I know a boycot of this set sounds very romantic, but as I've mentioned above, there are too many people out there, too young to understand our outrage (and aren't going to be persuaded by us old farts), who are still going to buy the set (along with the old farts like myself who see the value in the extra features), giving Lucas enough money to keep him from needing to release the originals.  Maybe, in a few years, Lucas will change his mind.  Maybe he'll go ahead and spend three or four dollars, make a little three disk set, no extra this and that, no special package design, showcasing the original unaltered films on DVD and make a another two or three million off of it.
B000021YQV|5.0|So im sitting here, naked, right? and im thinking to myself, Oh yeah! i was doing a review for this album. Well, a few main points on this album:<br />-Overall, a very impressive, very heavily made, politically messaging album<BR>-obviously very deserving of the 5 stars i gave it<BR>-impressive, addicting riffs<br />I am thinking, though, that this album is not as good as their first, self titled album. It seems that, with the album STEAL THIS ALBUM! that they are degenerating quickly. This album depicts the start of the fall of this band. All of the songs are impressive, but contemplating what has been going on in the first album, it is not as impressive. System of a Down has come up short, starting out acceptably but then to go down to their next album.<br />I wouldn't like to stray away from what i am saying, but this band progressively lost touch to their original style. If and when they release a fourth album, i would probably stay away from it.
B00005QAPH|5.0|The prominent film director Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) finds himself overworked, harassed, and fatigued in all aspect of being.  Guido is sent to a health spa where he is supposed to recover from his stressful life, but instead is continuously pursued by people around him, by his past, and by his conscious.  The people around Guido are either dependent on him, desire his company, or merely try to advertise themselves in his presence.  In order to cope with a large number of people Guido has developed a social dance where he is able to circumvent or approach the individuals of his choosing.  This dance is also Guido's way of dealing with life and its complications, which affects him physically, psychologically, and socially.<br />8½ fragmentally displays Guido's life as he dances between reality, dreams, and memories in the developmental stage of a film production.  This cerebral dance helps him to avoid what is deemed as uncomfortable as he escapes into his memories where he can find some joy and peace.  However, Guido often reminds himself of how his past sometimes plagues him as he can recollect deep memories of discomfort and guilt.  These negative emotions lead Guido into an internal crisis where he struggles with his decisions in the light of moral judgment that is heavily weighted by his Catholic upbringing.  Despite the internal crisis, the dance continuous as Guido is compelled to flee his painful memories by seeking company outside of his marriage as he seeks self-affirmation when he is alone.  The cheating provokes further guilt which urges Guido to remain dancing as he escapes into a dream world where he attempts to unify memories with the present where his consciousness sets the rules.  But to Guido's dismay he finds the dreams forcing him back into reality as his dreams rebel against himself.  This is due to his conflicting ideas that are simultaneously rejected and approved of in order to find temporary happiness and please those around him.  In essence, it is Guido's denial of his own lies that is the root to his guilt and unhappiness.<br />Fellini's 8½ is a cinematic masterpiece, which encourages analytical and artistic thinking as it dives into a dense fabric of inventive imagery.  Vividly Fellini paints Guido's moral crisis onto the silver screen, which offers a surreal cinematic experience as it drifts between reality and dreams.  In addition, 8½ shows Fellini's profound understanding of human psychology, which possibly could have been based on himself.  The fragmented story line enhances the visual feeling of the stress that Mastroianni's character experiences as well as developing a deep understanding for his mind.  The opening shot where Guido dreams of being enclosed in a smoldering car stuck in traffic displays Fellini's true cinematic genius as he develops an image of panic, anxiety, and fear.  This visualization is something that can be discovered in every film that Fellini has directed as well as his trademark of having a circus-like atmosphere.  8½ has everything of what makes it a Fellini film, which offers a unique experience that could only have been accomplished by a true cinematic artist.nce, it is Guido's denial of his own lies that is the root to his guilt and unhappiness.<br />Fellini's 8½ is a cinematic masterpiece, which encourages analytical and artistic thinking as it dives into a dense fabric of inventive imagery.  Vividly Fellini paints Guido's moral crisis onto the silver screen, which offers a surreal cinematic experience as it drifts between reality and dreams.  In addition, 8½ shows Fellini's profound understanding of human psychology, which possibly could have been based on himself.

0446310786|5.0|If you're on this page you see the plot points. You see the raves. You maybe even know Dill is based on the young Truman Capote.<br />TKAM is an American classic. The writing is from the point of view of an adult's childhood memory - chatty and imperfect but so dense and rich. It's sublime in style and execution. It's also filled with humor and compassion. You'll never read about another lawyer like Atticus Finch, that's for sure.<br />TKAM is foisted on high schoolers for a good reason: It's great and every American should read it at some point. But it's a book that every American should read outside the classroom, too.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|This movie was very good in my opinion. Daughter and I decided to start watching it last night around midnight, thinking we would watch the first 30 mins or so and finish it the next day, well that was not an option after it started playing. The movie was full of suspense and took an awesome turn in the end. We both enjoyed it to it's fullest. I would recommend this movie to everyone. But remember, grab the coke and popcorn before you sit down because you will not want to get up till it's over. Enjoy, we did.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Odd she gives her kid a Cuban name and does Castro schtick.  Time for a face lift and a clue.  The old bag is pathetic.<br />Does anyone under age 50 listen to her anymore?  She is so unhip.  Sorry granny but the beret and Clash rip off nonsense is pathetic.
B00000099Y|5.0|Let me just say I bought this CD something like 6 years ago (when I was in 7th grade) and I still consider it one of the greatest cds ever recorded.  Aenima is one of the pinnacles of music.  I don't understand why there are some idiots out there giving this a 1 star rating.  It just boggles my mind.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Every now and then a Broadway tune comes along that I like but never has one soundtrack moved me so much that I had to see the show. This one did.  I love this CD and I highly recommend it.  The harmonizing vocals of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are powerful, entertaining and the best I have heard from Broadway, ever. The music is telling a story about the girls and their dislike of each other and then their ultimate friendship.  The orchestra is &quot;Wickedly Fabulous&quot;.  I have several friends who either have this cd or have heard it, every one of them loves it, I have not yet talked with anyone who dislikes it.  If you can catch the show, it is enchanting.
B0002234LS|5.0|A lot of King fans will want to bash my head in after saying that, but this director took what I found to be a long, drawn out story, and sculpted it into 96 minutes of a highly entertaining film. <BR> Of course, as was stated in other reviews here, Johnny Depp really pulls this one off as in most of his films. They really took you into Mort Rainey's cracked world within the peaceful lake house. They had a different ending here than was in King's story and it worked fabulous. This ending should have been King's ending and I usually never say that about a printed piece of work from an author; but here I think we have a better ending in the movie, rather than on paper. <BR> Final perks of the DVD: Watch the bonus features but not before watching the movie first!!!! It will ruin the ending for you. But, the bonus material is first rate. You get a book to film feature, an inside story type feature, and a last one adding up to about an hour of interesting interviews on how the film was made. Usually only on special editions and bonus discs these days. Here you get your money's worth. <BR>One last note: be sure to check out the deleted scenes for the longer ending!! <br /> 5 STARS *****.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I admit I was non-plussed after my first viewing of this film. But something about it got under my skin, into my system, and I watched it again. Next thing I know, I'm at Ralph's writing a check for 89 cents (inflation) to buy half &amp; half to make another caucasian to watch the Big Lebowski again.<br />I'm not sure if it was the Stranger, the Tumblin' Tumbleweed song, &quot;Donnie, you're out of your element...Dude, the Chinaman is NOT the issue !!&quot; or the Dude listening to a tape recording of his championship bowling tournament on his Walkman while lying down on his new rug (which did NOT tie the room together like the old one...) or how about the dance cycle performed by the Dude's landlord ? or the Nihilist kidnappers and their nine-toed girlfriend ? this film is so chock full of hilarious, weird, off beat stuff that it takes at least three viewings to fully assimilate everything. so mix yourself a caucasian, do a jay if you like, and settle in for a fun two hours with El Duderino and friends. You'll be watching the funniest movie of all time.
B000268QB2|4.0|I am an occasional reviewer of music on Amazon, not that I am the 'be all and end all' for music opinion.  I only review CD's on Amazon that I feel must be purchased or completely avoided by anyone thinking about buying a particular CD.  That's why I'm here.  Keane, yet another British band introducing itself to American soil, has put together a beautiful album called Hopes and Fears.  (They bear more resemblance to Travis than any other British band) Keane are a trio of musicians who use piano/keyboards, bass and drums and oh yes, one beatiful voice.  There are zero guitars in this album.  If you are wondering what the songs are about you need only look at the title of the album.  This particular album, in my opinion, is completely worth purchasing for one song and one song alone.  &quot;This Is The Last Time&quot;, the second song on the album is it's heart and soul.  The lyrics boast, &quot;This is the last time/I will show my face/One last tender lie/And then I'm out of this place&quot; and who my friends has not been there?  This song, like most of the songs on the album, begin very wistfully, very calm and then explode into extraordinary melody mixed with a powerful, sincere voice.  You feel what these guys are singing.  For this reason I recommend you don't hesitate one second.  Add this to your shopping cart.  I'm leaving with more lyrics to another brilliant song on the album, &quot;Everybody's Changing&quot; - &quot;So little time/Try to understand that I'm/Trying to make a move just to stay in the game/Trying to stay awake and remember my name/Because everybody's changing/And I don't feel the same&quot;.  You've been there to?  Anyone who is human and has had hard luck in relationships will find a heartfelt connection to this album.  Now ask yourself if you experience hardships in your life and your relationships in the past and/or the present.  If you say yes, I HOPE you buy Keane's new album, if you don't I FEAR you are missing out.  <BR>Other Highlights - &quot;Bend and Break&quot;, &quot;We Might As Well Be Strangers&quot;, &quot;She Has No Time&quot; and &quot;Bedshaped&quot;.
B00005AAFS|4.0|I just have to say that for the first time i find incredibly unfair that we cant rate higher than 5 cos i would have to give it 10 out of 5. Anybody reading this i just have to tell you to do yourself the biggest favour of your life and go buy this album. I have read alot of reviews here and i have noticed that this is one of the few albums that has gotten so many fives. This is just the most amazing album ever!!!! I got interested in this band when i visited a site where this guy kept raving on about them and people kept asking what is a Rammstein(lol). Then a penfriend made a compilation of a few of their songs for me and and i was in love. Instantly. And now i have my friends obssessing. Ok enough fawning.<br />This album (mine is a CDplus with all three on the same CD) is by far the best Rammstein album yet. Whether or not you're a fan you will not be disappointed. It is insulting to compare them to KMFDM (dont get me wrong ,i like those guys) for the simple reason that there is not a band who sound like them. They are in a league of their own. There are 11 powerful tracks on this album each one as slamming and asskicking  as the next. Dark , riveting, absolutely HANUTING and spellbinding. The beauty of the songs literally brought tears to my eyes. Orgasmic! American rock just cannot compare to German metal. And I hope they always sing in their native tongue ( guttural and demonic sounding ...smiles...).<br />MEIN HERTZ BRENNT - opens with a sinister voice ( not much unlike Heirate Mich) muttering followed by a mix of sound that will knock your socks off. Pay attention to the amazing bridge. poetic lyrics.simply stunning. take the time to find the translation.<br />LINKS 234 - For those of you like to dance , this is one that will get you on your feet make you wild one minute and sensual the next. True Rammsteinesque style.<br />SONNE - Simply awesome. Pretty well known. The chorus is amazing with haunting backing. And the female wailing in the back towards themiddle of the track will just send your senses soaring.<br />ICH WILL - I cannot even begin to describe. I cannot sit still when i hear this. One of the greatest torture i can imgaine is to play this to someone and force them not to react to it. Same female vocals in the background and check out the crowd chanting back responses!<br />FEUER FREI - I dare you to sit still after the first Feuer frei is uttered. The beat , the bass .... and the quiet verse at the end - Phew!<br />MUTTER - Very well known track i imagine. Very sad - from the lyrics to the way it sung. One of the best parts is when he whispers the word Mutter and then shouts it out loud.<br />SPIELHUR - Made the mistake of forwarding through the intro to this one and the first few times i missed the great beginning. I think the verses could be better but otherwise another great song.<br />ZWITTER - Find the translations. So funny. Someone said it was the sound birds made in german (lmmfao at that).<br />REIN RAUS - A lot of people said this was their least favorite. It is not as heavy and as saturated as the others. It has its moments though and the lyrics are actually quite amusing.<br />ADIOS - This is the one song on the album that i might compare to KMFDM. Very industrial sound. only thing i didn't like was the quiet part but it picks back up with just as much gusto. The guitar riffs are pure insanity!<br />NEBEL - Quiet note on which to end the album. Slow Sinister one.<br />Basically this album is an experience . One you should not miss. If the choir in church sounded like that ( they do seem to have this hypnotic quality )every human being would attend mass ( this is not an invitation for christians to attack me) .Personally i feel highly creative when i listen to it. My advice is at night ( or close the curtains) , put this on as high as suits you , roll some weed - or a plain fag would do just as nicely and prepare to lose yourself in the world , the beauty that is Mutter. Or better yet - forgetthe grass. The album itself is enough to give you a high you wont forget!!!
B000002J29|5.0|Genesis has been around since a really long time but seen most of its best times in the 70s.... there have also been great changes in the group.... the biggest change being Peter leaving and Phil filling his shoes. This album contains most of Gabriel times songs ... of each which is a classic..(Including the great progressive piece Supers Ready ) all which are sung by Phil Collins who has done a lovely job of it too.. , the album also contains songs from Phil's First Genesis album as lead singer 'Trick of a Tail' <BR>The main contents that a live album must have are good songs ... the songs should also sound a little different from the studio versions and last but still really important , the recording quality should be good ...Seconds out has all 3 of these qualities .. which makes in One of the best live performances in progressive rock history... A must buy even if you owe all these songs on studio albums.
0743244249|3.0|I guess I was lucky in that I began with Mao II and White Noise and went from there. So I know what DeLillo is capable of. I was giddy to read this new one. But, like other reviewers, I was reminded of Brett Easton Ellis, even from the title (which reminded me of &quot;Glamorama&quot;). And that made me nervous right away.<br />The worst part about this novel is that it's completely contrived. We never get the feeling these characters are truly alive, only that DeLillo is trying to tell us something via their interaction. The coincidental meetings with the wife (you'll see) are a perfect example. But there are others. If we're just going to ride around in a limo, slowly, without any solid plot to hang our hat on, then anyone who happens to stop in for a chat will appear to have been shoved into that limo by the author.<br />But for the good news: it's DeLillo. A fix for the addict. His dialogue is sharp, funny and truncated, as always. Some of the passages are pure poetry (the section about the kids dancing at a rave in a burnt-out building is sublime). We know about DeLillo's apocalyptic obsessions, which were firmly in place long before 9/11, and this is more of the same. Or is it? He never mentions terrorism, but he's got a two-bit gang of thugs flinging rats around the city in demonstrations against capitalism. And there are threats on the protagonist's life. And it takes place in New York City. NYC is the cosmopolis of the title, the &quot;city of the world,&quot; a stage that shows a microcosm of the terror in store for all mankind. So this is good old prescient DeLillo, warbling, and the sound of it will stand up to anything being written today.<br />Don't get this if you've never read any Don DeLillo--you'll probably be turned off. Mao II and White Noise are both great starting points, but even some of the earlier stuff that DD has since scorned (Americana, End Zone, Great Jones Street) would be a better beginning.
B00005NB8K|5.0|This is the best rock movie ever made. Oliver Stone is the most talented filmmaker of all time. This is a film he gets less credit for, but it was very personal to him and brilliantly done. First of all, he nails the life of Jim Morrison, the story of The Doors, and the L.A. Scene (1960s) as perfectly as it can be done. It is beyond nostalgoia, it is time travel.<br />As great as Stone's use of Doors songs, scenery, drug use and beautiful, heavily-decorated '60s California girls is, it is Val Kilmer who does this turn its proudest. Kilmer probably gets to the core of a real person as thoroughly and realistically as any actor who ever portrayed actual folks.<br />Next on the agenda, you have to love Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger and Kyle McLaughlin as a spot on, irritating Ray Manzarek. To those of us who really studied Morrison and The Doors, everything is flawless. The film also conveys the essence of the bar scene, particularly Morrison urinating at Barney's Beanery, which used to be a real rock hangout before it turned into a cafe.<br />The feeling watching &quot;The Doors&quot; switches between a longing for the romance and excitement of the rock life these people led, and revulsion for the drugs and immorality inherent within it.<br />Love my girl!<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>...
B0000028RR|5.0|This record is like a kick in the *ss, then you groove along with it. The music is instantly catchy, yet it's enduring because the lyrics actually have something to say, instead of being just &quot;a song&quot;. None of these songs sound like another, each has it's own signature, yet they still fit well together.<br />If you pay attention to the words, you will want to know more about what they're singing about. After you think about it, I'm almost certain that you'll gain at least a little insight into some issues. If not, at least you've still got some great music, some of the best from the 90's.
B000089RVR|5.0|I would reccomend this CD for those who like John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Maroon 5, Sarah Mclachlan, and Coldplay.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is awesome! How the heck did it get cancelled????
B0000DD7NL|4.0|this is the first R&amp;B CD i've listened to and really loved. tracks that stand out:<BR>Karma-great chorus, funky beat-4/5<BR>Heartburn-fun and catchy-4/5<BR>If I Ain't Got You-LOVE the piano on this here, and her voice is especially gorgeous.-5/5<BR>Diary-soft and soothing-4/5<BR>Samsonite Man-it was the chorus that made me notice this.-5/5<br />all and all, this is a smooth and funky CD, with a good mix of rock, R&amp;B, and jazz.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|This is a great CD, this sounds nothing like Queens or any other of  Josh's bands/projects.  The cd is great and the band is awesome.  And to the guy who said this cd sucks, your wrong, the name Eagles of Death Metal is supposed to be a joke, they are no where close to being death metal, so good job wang, the band owns.
B0002858YS|5.0|This album is very reminiscent of  80's new wave sound. One can  tell these sin city rockers were influenced by many of the bands from that era like New Order, a little Smiths & Duran Duran. Stand out tracks are the single \\"Somebody Told Me, \\"Mr Brightside,  \\"Smile like you mean it, & \\"All these things that I've done\\". But the whole cd is amazing with top notch production & bringing back the use of the synthesizer. Brandon Flowers has a great powerful yet melodic voice. With all that emo/punk music out today it's nice to see a throw back to the 80's synthpop sound that I grew up with. One of the best albums & band I picked up in 2004.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is absolutely amazing! I admit that I have not had the luxury of traveling to New York to see the show, but I am awaiting the tour! (It's also sad to know of Idina and Kristin's imminent plans to leave the cast) I cannot count how many times I have listened to the Wicked soundtrack...and it's not just several select songs that I listen to at a time.  I kick back and listen to the entire thing! The incredible harmonies between Idina and Kristin and the powerful orchestration take me in every time. As a person who loves watching and performing musical theatre, Wicked is definitely a sing-along musical! I can't help belting out Elphaba's songs like &quot;No Good Deed&quot; and &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;.  It's kind of crazy, but I feel like I know the characters of Wicked, just from listening to their story.  Although the Tony award performance was a bit over-rated, I'm sure that seeing the show live would be a lot more intense.  All CD's are mixed and tweaked, and just because live performers don't sound perfect doesn't mean their characters are lacking.  I love the Wicked CD and cannot wait to see the show live!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't watch television - I read.  But every once in a while something comes along that all my friends (whose opinions I respect) tell me to watch and I haven't regretted it yet.  That's what happened with Buffy, with Angel, and now with Firefly.  A wonderful mix of characters, interesting scenario, good acting, excellent humor, this show has it all.  I don't regret buying it, and I know I'll watch it many times.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers was a great book and the transition from page to film was flawless.  It helped with Stephen Ambrose helming this before he died in 2001, and with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg helping produce.  However, the applause goes to the young actors who played the officers and enlisted men.  Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Dale Dye, Kirk Acevedo, Michael Cudlitz, Donnie Wahlberg, Mark Gomez, and even Tom Hanks' son, Colin Hanks.  The film was brutally real, no bleeps or family friendly fair, just honest portrayals of the greatest generation of soldiers, ever.  The 506 Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, Easy Comany, is an ecclectic group from everywhere in the US.  The film keeps you interesting in every wise-cracking mechanic, businessman, farmer, and cab driver who lived and fought and even died for their country.  Every character existed and really trodded this earth.  Easy Company's reaction to the Nazi concentration camps was heartbreaking and equally on par with parts of Schindler's List, and even old movies like The Big Red One with Lee Marvin.  Shocking, and a horrible wake up call to farm boys and city dwellers sheltered from mass murder and Hitler until Pearl Harbor.  No soldier expected those horrors, let alone the Battle of the Bulge and D-Day.  Band of Brothers is not just a must for a historian or military freak, but a staple for most Americans seeking inspiration and recollections of patriotism which is sorely lacking.  This was released after September 11, on HBO and was well timed.  Tom, Steven, Mr. Ambrose, and the others, you did a magnificent job.  Kind of makes me want to see if Citizen Soldiers or D-Day will be made for HBO or a cable network.  Outstanding.
0385512104|5.0|Fascinating glimpse into a mind which works differently from most people's, observant of details but unaware of the subtleties of human interactions.  It starts as a bit of a mystery but segues into more of a story of relationships of this boy and his family and neighbors.  It is quite unlike anything else I've read and completely charmed me.
1559408855|3.0|The conspiracy theories, the bootlegs, the ceremonial passing around of 'sealed' copies (gonna watch it, son?) on eBay for obscene amounts of money...well, finally, according to people I know who know the people at Criterion, the big bad boy of the DVD universe will be re-released in the near future (December, perhaps).  Maybe now we can put the capper on this business of reselling these plastic things without any real regard for their quality or content.  The film was very poorly transferred and is, frankly, a well-fashioned curio at best.  A little sanity, please.
B000294SFW|5.0|Motorhead releases a monster LP that will definitely kill the lawn.  Gotta hand it to the band, the songwriting, as the numbers are truly original.<br />Has anybody noticed Lemmy is starting to look like the Marlboro Man?  I don't think the British Pirate turned Cowboy look is working.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is quite possibly the best television series I've ever seen.  Each episode is unique and good in its own way.  The camera angles are amazing (especially the exterior space shots that mimic out-of-focus zooming like you're really watching the events through a camera mounted on a ship).  Physics are pretty well respected, and the show makes the best use of &quot;sound doesn't travel in outer space&quot; I've ever seen.  The characters are unique and multidimensional.  And really, what other broadcast show has a prostitute on it who takes male and female customers in very sensuous love scenes?  This show has everything going for it.  It's just a shame that it was canceled so soon.  Luckily there's a movie coming out!
B00004YKUY|3.0|This cd is very long, which is strange for a band attempting a comeback.  I'm not saying it's bad, but prior Journey cds said what they said in an average of about 50 minutes or so, and each cd was very concise and well put together.  This one, really, is not bad, and I don't mean to imply otherwise.  What it is, is tiring.  I like Journey, even with the new lead singer, but 70-plus minutes is a lot of time for even bands that I just love.  Had I been involved, which as usual, people don't consult me, I would have kept some of the material for a later release instead of just unnecessarily overloading a cd.  Anyway, some people like to get their money's worth by having a cd contain a long period of music; I prefer the shorter concise, well thought out cds.  I think this cd would have been better if it were five songs shorter.  More does not necessarily mean better; it just means more in this case.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I have always been a John Wiliams fan. He has written amazing music and Harry Potter and the prisioner of Azkaban is no exception. He has created a whole new atmosphere an makes the environment darker than in the other films. He has added not commonly used instruments, like the recorder,  and has made this music magical.
B00005JL78|1.0|I borrowed this movie because it looked good, but when i saw it im like what is this, I didnt like this movie at all the first 10 min is good but then its got boring rite after.
B000088E6D|5.0|Only once in a lifetime does someone come along who sings like this. <br />I've now played and replayed this stupendous album for days and can't get enough. The material he has covered are marvelous songs (some old standards, some newer) with rich arrangements and fantastic musicians. It's a topnotch album, one that reflects the high standard that Mr. Buble is being so widely applauded for. I read today that he has sold over 2.5 Million copies of this album worldwide and it's no wonder. <BR>Take a listen and discover why this is surely his first of many many many great hits.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Following a break in recording Mick Jaggar, who had compiled an immense record collection, began sampling his records.  His recordings were mostly bluegrass, blues, and country.  When the band reached the recording studio they made an American recording that included both blues and country with a Rolling Stone flavor.  Beggar's Banquet was the result.  It is one of the greatest recordings of all time.  The record is great, saving the best for last in a tribute song Salt of the Earth.
B0000020C4|5.0|A few months ago I learnt the piano score for 'On My Own'. A little later, on the recommendation of my sister, I watched the DVD of the TAC and was blown away. Then, I watched the entire thing again. And spent another 5 hours re-watching my favourite bits. Then, I got this CD for my birthday.<br />Colm Wilkinson/Jean Valjean - simply stated, amazing. Although the little shrieks at the end of long notes are a bit annoying (Another story must begiiiiiiiin-ek!), he is a brilliant singer and really interpretates the character well.<br />Philip Quast/Javert - another excellent singer, really becomes Javert. I couldn't imagine any other as the strict, disciplined, harsh law enforcer whose world falls to pieces.<br />Ruthie Henshall/Fantine - pure delight to hear her (when she sings 'You let your foreman seeeeennnd' close your eyes and breathe in, and let it out on 'me away'. She has the lovliest voice I've ever heard). Fits the part amazingly.<br />Michael Maguire/Enjolras - good singer, looks fit the part perfectly. However he does strain on the high notes ('They will come when we cccaaaeeeellllll')<br />Michael Ball/Marius - good singer through most of it, but really comes out in 'Empty Chairs and Empty Tables'. If not technically a perfect singer, Ball still suits the part perfectly.<br />Judy Kahn/Cosette - the only one I really did not like. Her looks don't fit the part and she sings with little emotion. Watching her on the DVD is like watching a marble column sing; perfect, but not lively enough.<br />Alun Armstrong and Jenny Gallowy/M+Mme Threnadier - extremely funny, although Armstrong's 'Dog Eat Dog' was not memorable. Galloway was perfect. Hilarious.<br />Lea Salonga/Eponine - unbelievable voice, lots of emotion but somehow it was always Lea Salonga, not Eponine. Her duet with Marius 'A little fall of rain' is a real tearjerker, even after 20 listenings.<br />Hannah Chick and Adam Searles/Young Cosette and Gavroche - adorable. Very cutsie-pie, although Hannah isa bit off-tune in 'Castle On A Cloud'. Adam has the perfect amount of cheekiness (watch his expression when he sings 'This only goes to show what little people can do'!)<br />Overall? Brilliant cast, music unforgettable, excellent performances BUT I don't like Kahn, and there are no lyrics! For this reason I would recommend getting the DVD and watching it, as the live performance improves even the fantastic singing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I consider myself intelligent and a connoisseur of quality TV viewing. That said, Firefly is without a doubt the best show i've ever seen and I can whole-heartedly recommend the Firefly DVD box set to anyone keen on taking TV viewing to the next level.<br />Joss Whedon is a genius..  nuff said.
B000002H6C|5.0|Okay first things first it is hard to beat Master Of Puppets but the best moments here like on One and Frayed Ends Of Sanity equal anything on Master except for Orion.Secondly I think the only 2 albums Ive heard that are better than Metallica's Master Of Puppets are Sgt Pepper by The Beatles and Dark Side Of The Moon by Pink Floyd.Okay now on with the songs here.Blackened is a great opener I think it starts out more like Hit The Lights but the song as a whole is really more similar to Fight Fire With Fire and Battery.And Justice For All and Eye Of The Beholder are great songs but nothing on here beats the bands first song that was played on MTV(the song One).It starts out like Sanitarium and Fade To Black but ends up sounding more like Creeping Death.It has some of Kirk's best lead guitar playing and some of Lars best drumming(yeah I know it sounds tinny but its still great),Shortest Straw sounds a lot like the direction they were heading in before they released the Black Album and Harvester Of Sorrow is a very dark and disturbing song.Its so disturbing Ive had nightmares about it no lie.Frayed Ends Of Sanity is a very excellent and aggressive song,To Live Is To Die is a beautiful instrumental with great rhythm guitar and bass playing and Dyers Eve is an excellent closer.The only real problem with this album is that the production is not that good.The rhythm playing isnt as good as previous efforts but it makes up for it with some of James' best vocal work.
B00005JKES|3.0|TWIN PEAKS is a masterpiece, any fan should get this, however:<BR>I cannot seem to access more than one episode per DVD, and the information at the top of each screen from which to choose from is barely readable.  I cannot tell how to click different episodes, much less find them on the DVDs.

B00008S2VG|3.0|OK this is my third review for Madonna's \\"average\\", in it's own right, American Life effort.<br />I just think it's sad when people can say that fans of Madonna are starting to get tired of an aging pop icon singing dance music. The irony of it is that just two years ago Madonna had the second biggest dance hit of her entire career. (behind Vogue) It was also this very hit that was the biggest selling single of the year, the biggest dance/club play single, and garnered a Grammy nod for record of the year. \\"Music\\" was that very single, and the album that brought forth that single was Madonna's third best selling album world-wide. It's incredible that she managed to top most of her biggest albums, (except True Ble and The I Collection) and almost everyone of her singles (except Vogue) at 19 years in the music bizz, at that time. Just two years ago Madonna had one of the best times of her career, and was ultimately garnering what R&B singer Beyonc'e is doing now; Madonna was having the \\"it\\" year, everybody was talking about her. Now two years later people are saying she's fading! OMG! they were saying that after she came out with the single for \\"Nothing Really Maters,\\" then came her smash hit \\"Beautiful Stranger,\\"  \\"American Pie,\\" and later her behemoth hit \\"Music.\\" So when critics say Madonna is fading be prepared for another \\"invention\\" that will prove why she's still here. Honestly some say Madonna's had her comebacks, but in reality she was always in the spotlight and she obviously has more memorable hits than every artist, even rivaling Elvis and the Beatles, who by all means is her only feat yet to conquer. Aretha only has Respect and a couple others. Micheal Jackson has Bad, Thriller, and a couple others. As for other artist name one that has more memorable hits than Madonna. Exactly you can't because she is the most memorable female artist, although not to prestige by some critic's standards, and by Grammy award wins, her record sales, hits, singles, appeal, fame, and longevity isnt rivaled by no female, unless you think Elvis and the Beatles look good in drag.  How can someone say that people are tired of an aging pop icon singing dance songs when Madonna lieterally dominates the dance chart. FYI you can check the very same source you saw Madonna's American Life effort drop quicker than the ray of light, and you will see that Madonna dominates the dance charts and single sales. Madonna is pushing 40 for how many number 1 dance singles she's earned, so helllllloooooooo, check your information.<br />Ultimately what killed this album was the fact that Madonna pulled the original American Life video. Some of her fans felt as though that decision she made was tarnishing most of the career stunts she's made in the past, but oftenly said she had no regrets to. Literally, some fans thought she was throwing away her secret weapon that has earned her every right as the \\"queen of shock\\", she was losing her \\"shock.\\" Any other time Madonna would have released her video efforts regardless what factor it might degrade or who, but in this case she was afraid of being \\"Dixie Chicked,\\" causing her fans to come to the assumption that she isn't the Madonna, in which has garnered millions of fans worldwide. That killed the album, although it debuted at number 1, I guess some of the gay fans she's garnered couldn't live without a new Madonna album, other than listening to the same Hip-Hop/Rap and R&B crap (most of it) that they play on the radio redundantly. Let's be honest on Madonna's Hollywood, she was obviously talking about how music about gangster life (RAP) and bootys shakin (RAP) dominated the radio. \\"Music Stations always play the same songs, I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong.\\" <br />Some might say she knew she wasn't gonna get any airplay with this album, although I though some songs like: Hollywood, Love Profusion, Intervention, Nothing Fails, Mother & Father, and I'm So Stupid were very radio-friendly. Call me crazy, but the same \\"Clear Channel\\" that people say blacklisted Madonna from airplay and media, is the same \\"Clear Channel\\" that's promoting her tour. . . .what if this was one of Madonna's stunts and she planned the whole thing . . . .then I would understand completely why they crown her the \\"queen of shock.\\" <br />Buy this album from Amazon.com only because their service is obviously the best and they're friendly, bottomline it's obvious why this is the number one place for all your CD, DVD, etc. needs. This album is good and you more than likely wont skip any songs, but ultimately, it's not her best, but not her worst either . . .let's say in between. Madonna I'm expecting better next time, and Amazon.com thank you for the best service on the net.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna, you are totally incredible!!  This is the woman who changed music forever and put it in the right direction after being exposed to such dull music such as Floyd or Styx (heh, heh, heh, yes, believe it or not, there are actually Styx fans still around!!).<BR>This CD has got classic after classic of just WONDERFUL music that hasn't been heard in a long time (outside of Cher and Britney, of course!).<BR>I gaurantee a 100% satisfaction from this classic, that will leave you begging for some more Madonna.<BR>THIS IS THE ONE FOLKS, DO NOT FAIL TO INVEST IN THIS PHENOMONAL ART!!!
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|A delightful diversion from regular films! The screen frequently pops with whimsical exaggerations and candy-tinted flourishes in this imaginative adaptation of Wallace's novel.<br />Plus, we have a liberal dollop of humourous banter, dealing with an evocative theme that most of us could relate to. Unlike the big narrative arc that is typical of most movies, we get a collection of woolly, offbeat short stories featuring the same pivotal character. Which is great.<br />On the potential negative side, if you don't like fantasia, be warned: there are oodles of make-believe tricks and tropes, and by the time we drag to the supposedly reconciliatory finale, the deck is so stacked against reality that one needs a jug of cappucino to continue caring.<br />Not to mention that there are at least three British artists in the lead attempting a Southern drawl (with mixed results) in their accents.<br />Regardless, what's not to savour in a well-made movie with no problems that a better judgment in editing wouldn't have solved!<br />Recommended rental.
B000002J1U|5.0|Yes it was 1970 and this was the first Led Zeppelin album I had owned. There will be arguments about which was the best but for this listener the first time was the best time. God, it had everything! Hammering riffs (Immigrant Song, Out on the Tiles) folky haze (That's the Way, Tangerine) and blues madness (Since I've been loving You, Hats off to Roy Harper). Was there ever a better and more varied album of great songs? I never heard it if there was. &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was magic but this was .... out there. It still is. Buy it and love it like I did in 1970. It still excites and moves me. Thank you guys. Rock 'n Roll spoken here...
0743457900|5.0|I have read most of LeCarre's works and find that his recent output cannot come close to the magnificent Smiley trilogy, of which, for me, TTSS is the masterpiece. Character,  atmosphere, and mood seem pitch perfect. Calling it a &quot;spy novel&quot; is as beside the point as calling Huckleberry Finn a novel about a boy and a river. The test of a great book is whether you look forward to re-reading it, at the expense of reading something new. I look forward to re-reading TTSS every few years and continue to marvel at the depth of psychological insight and artful construction.  Lovers of the book, of course, will also want to own the magnificent DVD, which captures one of the finest productions ever mounted for television.
B00005JLKN|2.0|Red Dragon was a decent movie by itself, though it relied on the prestige of SOTL too much.  It starts off adding an extra scene to include Anthony Hopkins, and continues this habit throughout the movie.  These scenes are not in the book and do nothing to further the movie.  Red Dragon has an all-star cast, though no one seems to put effort into their role.  Most importantly, Edward Norton (playing Will Graham) fails to portray the innner conflict in Graham.  He seems unaffected by the case, which couldn't be farther from the truth.  Manhunter was a much better movie, with much better directing and acting.  In Manhunter, William Peterson plays Graham and does the part much better.  Peterson plays a dark, brooding investigator who is truly sacrificing a part of himself to take on the case.  This self-sacrifice is the heart of the book, and was largely lost in Red Dragon.  I recommend that anyone interested in Red Dragon watch Manhunter instead.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Absolutely horrible!<BR>My friend got this cd and you might as well sell it in a garage sale. Waste of 12 bucks, that's for sure. <BR>Save your money for something worth listening to
0316666343|3.0|The Lovely Bones is a good book, but it doesn't know what it wants to be. The first chapter is the best chapter in the whole book and then it all went down hill from there. One mintue the story about Susie, the next is about her friend, and in between it's about her mom. It's like a book of short stories with no central theme. Is it a suspense story or love story? The switching body part of the story is totally out of context. Read the first half of the book and then jump to the ending. you won't miss a thing.
B00018D44U|5.0|Well, I can't understand all these critical voices out there.<BR>&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; - sure.. isn't really to top. But it was a more like- melancholly record.. And this one's like the sunshie. <BR>You'll be introduced by &quot;Sunrise&quot; a really beautiful song for your breakfasts, or whatever ;) Even if it rains you feel like the sun is rising..<BR>After that &quot;What Am I To You&quot; makes you think a little. It's very beautiful because it's mixed up clearly. And the guitar makes it even better.<br />&quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; is for those lovers out there... and it's so cute. I think her voice is extaordinary beautiful in this track.<BR>&quot;Carnival Town&quot; is very slow and I heard it life and she sang only with the music of the piano.. and if you're in the mood, it can make you cry.<BR>&quot;In The Morning&quot; - a kinda Country-stylish song. Yeess.. It's cool! Nice guitar again!<BR>&quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot; makes your heart smile ..it's a great Jazz track...<BR>&quot;Creepin' In&quot;- Defenentley the fastest track and it's powerful. She even has got Country- Star Dolly Parton with her and this is THE ultimate song for your mood.. At home, in car, or elsewhere.. GREAT!<BR>&quot;Toes&quot;-wonderful lyrics and it's so well produced. Very beautiful.<BR>&quot;Humble Me&quot; - I think the phrase &quot;It never rains when you want it to&quot; kinda describes this song. It's such a sad one.<BR>&quot;Above Ground&quot; it's strange but wonderful!<BR>&quot;The Long Way Home&quot; Here comes the Country again.. Ahr. Great! It's like you feel the sun setting in front of you or so- try it by yourselft..hhehe<BR>&quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; Jazz.. and it's a song for your dreams.<BR>&quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot;  seems like an ironic track, 'cause it's kinda confused.. &quot;I don't miss you at all... And then I wonder who I am, without the warm touch of your hand&quot;.. very slowly..<br />So.. This is a great record! Just go listen to it, leave behind those articles about it, that tell you it's boring... I did that too and bought it and I feel not sorry about it.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|56x platinum and counting... need I say more?
0399226907|5.0|I loved this book as a child, and it is now one of my daughters favorite books. This is a MUST HAVE for all children.
068484267X|1.0|Stinkaroo!  Thank god I borrowed this work of maudlin stereotypical crap from the library so I didn't actually fork over any cash for it.  Jeez, if I was Irish I would be completely insulted by the authors' ludicrous, stereotypical portrayal of the anguished poor Irish Catholic family.  &quot;Aw no da's drunk agin!  Aw no, ma's bein' shagged!  Aw, I wish ere lived in Ameriki!&quot;  Blah blah blah!  These characters aren't  even as well developed as the  guy on the Lucky Charms box.  Has McCourt ever been to Ireland?<br />I couldn't even finish it.  It just plodded and sobbed and whined on and on and on. In fact, before I took it back to the library I inscribed in one of the early chapters, &quot;WARNING:  MORE CRAP AHEAD&quot;.  I didn't consider that defacing library property, I considered it a public service.
0307120007|3.0|My daughter enjoys this book from time to time. I, on the other hand, can't get past the smell of the flowers in it. I gag everytime I get near it. The book is somewhat bland. I wouldn't really reccoment it to buy.
B000002MIF|5.0|One of the greatest albums of all-time...extra appealing because most of it is lo-fi, but beautifully lo-fi.  Every song is a masterpiece of intelligent vulnerable British pop music.  The music, written by Johnny Marr, is brilliantly melodic.  The words are worthy of Oscar Wilde, one of lyricist Morrissey's major influences, along with early 60's black and white British working class films like Taste of Honey (snatches of dialogue from this film can be found in the lyrics to This Night Has Opened My Eyes, an extremely powerful song).  This album is the greatest Smiths album, and that's saying a LOT, since every Smiths album was BRILLIANT.  The Smiths recording career lasted from 1984-1987, but they were extremely prolific.  This was their second release, technically a collection of radio recordings and singles, but it works perfectly as an album with its own theme.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First off,if Slipknot is not metal,what is?Acoustic tracks only show off the diversity of the music itself.Solos are just a way of showing skill.There were solos on their other cds,they just weren't as dominant.This cd is more mature and awe-inspiring than the others.&quot;Iowa&quot; was just brutal and monotonous.&quot;Vol. 3&quot; shows much growing up on Slipknot's part.I would give this cd a ten if I could,but I'll have to settle for a 5.Go out and get it if you have any idea of what good music is.
B0002234LS|2.0|I liked this movie better when it was called Identity.  I mean, Fight Club.  I mean, A Beautiful Mind.  I mean...
