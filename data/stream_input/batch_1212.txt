1848566980|5.0|I pre-ordered this book when a friend alerted me to its imminent publication.  One of Mr Foss' earlier works \\"Spacecraft, 2000-2100 A.D.: Terran Trade Authority Handbook by Stewart Cowley\\" is literally sitting on my nightstand and even 30 some odd years after its publication is one of my favorite books.    The color and structure of Mr Foss' work is truly unique.  Giant spaceships with the most colorful scheme you've ever seen look right at home in these pictures.  One of my favorite video games \\"Homeworld\\" obviously draw a great deal of its inspiration from Mr Foss' art.    If you appreciate good art and enjoy sci-fi settings, landscapes etc, this book will really impress you.    Physically the book is top notch as well, great color, great quality paper, great binding all at a great price.  I really, really cant recommend this enough.
0307887898|5.0|If  you are familiar with Lean or Agile software development you have probably heard many of the concepts in this book. What you might not have considered is the role of testing, feedback, and other key agile development enablers at the business an organizational level. Eric Ries explains how to use the techniques of lean production to innovate.  While those with a deep understanding of lean might find it obvious that the key to getting better at what you do is to have goals, test, measure, and use techniques like \\"5 Why's\\" to understand problems, often people think of business and engineering as silos, and don't understand that being lean is an organization-wide process.<br /><br />This book is an enjoyable read, filled with stories from both Ries' consulting and startup experience. For those who want to learn more, it's filled with references to sources for more information. Business people will learn more about lean engineering, engineers will learn how lean applies to the business. This book can help you to understand how to innovate, whether you are working on a project of starting a company.

B005HEEE8I|5.0|\\"Space Seed\\" is my favorite first season Star Trek episode and was the basis for the second Star Trek movie, [[ASIN:B002I9Z8B2 Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan (Restored) [Blu-ray]]] (also my favorite).<br /><br />No spoilers from me: The crew of the Enterprise locate a derelict Earth space craft, \\"Botany Bay\\", from the 1990s (we are apparently somewhat behind where Roddenberry thought we would be by now) and revive the ship's hibernating crew. There is a bit of a culture class between the 23rd century crew of the Enterprise and the 20th century crew of the Botany Bay. This also has a great guest star, Ricardo Montalban as Khan, who turns out to have a history and personality that creates a great deal turmoil on the Enterprise.<br /><br />This is a really good episode, Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I loved Star Wars and would love to see it on my hi-def plasma in all its glory.  It is not to be found on these disks.  Screw George Lucas for changing a wonderful film and then burying the original.  I will not buy this product or any other Star Wars offering unti the original film is made available.  I do not mind if the original film stock is restored or the sound is tweeked for modern home theater but for god's sake, don't change the plot.  Han shot first!    Han shot first!  Han shot first!

B0052WSX32|5.0|This wonderful album represents a welcome re-evaluation and appreciation of a world-class singer whose music often gets unfairly overlooked due to her huge worldwide film stardom in the 1950s-1960s. The MY HEART album serves as a sample of the wide range of material that Day has convincingly and warmly covered in her recorded library - tackling late-night jazz with the Andre Previn Trio on \\"My One & Only Love,\\" bouncy showtunes such as \\"Hurry It's Lovely Up Here\\" and the autobiograhical \\"Ohio,\\" Great American songbook standards \\"My Buddy\\" and \\"Life Is Just A Bowl Of Cherries,\\" modern classics \\"You Are So Beautiful\\" and \\"Disney Girls,\\" Top 40 material \\"Daydream\\" and original ballads like the tender \\"My Heart\\" and the uptempo \\"Heaven Tonight.\\" Doris Day's smokey yet silky vocals are as striking as ever and it's no wonder that her diversity appeals to famous fans from Queen's Brian May to the late, great British pop-soul diva Dusty Springfield.     Like most pop singers with careers that began during the golden era of the 1940s and 1950s, Doris was under contract to a record company (Columbia) that required her to release singles which often featured novelty songs and less-weighty material. However, her many albums were always top-notch affairs with the greatest songs of the era which have stodd the test of time. Doris played many successful, independently strong women in the romantic comedies that made up the bulk of her post-\\"Pillow Talk\\" 1960s movies but above all else it's her seductive singing that makes you realize what a tremendous lover Doris Day really is -- \\"MY HEART\\" is an intimate and joyful experience.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|I am a major gadget nut and I love to play video games. I bought the Kinect last year and preordered over 2/3's of the games. Of those, only 2-3 were moderately usable for me. I researched like crazy on the Kinect and it was not until about a week before it was released that they announced the real requirements for it. Microsoft originally said you only needed six feet in order to play. That's a lie. It starts at 6 feet and goes all the way to 12 feet. 6-10 feet for single player and 8-12 feet for multiplayer. My black leather couch is exactly 7.5 feet away from the the xbox sensor. The couch is huge and one of the deluxe lazy boy sofa and I am not moving that beast to play games. I could play Kinect Adventures, Dance Central, and Joy Ride ok. Your Shape was hit and miss. My leg would end up touching the couch and the game would go nuts. You would look on the screen and the leg would either disappear or do some kind of crazy MJ leg move. Several times I would have to lean back like in the matrix just to get a move right. I was greatly disappointed. I almost returned it, but I thought they would release a patch. Almost a year later there is no patch. Kinect was just collecting dust since you can't count on it. 50-80% of the time I would be ok playing single player, but I'd always run into that one move or one step that I couldn't do or my kinect would not detect because of the couch. I was incredibly happy that Nyko announced the Zoom. I just received it last night and it works great. My kinect is fun. Still not as good as ps move, but the kinect sees me and not the couch. You will need to adjust it slighly. The way the lens is setup you may have to move it. I had to lower mine a little bit so it would see the floor and I also move it a little to the side. The lens on the Zoom is wide angle so you will need an extra foot or two width wise. I had to move mine a few inches to the right since I have a recliner to the left of my tv. You need to re-run the calibration soI hope you kept the card. You don't have to, but you get better accuracy. I'd also re-run the kinect identifier utility. I am very happy with the peripheral and don't tell Nyko, but I would have paid 2-3 times what they are asking just to make my kinect usable. Now, I can finally play all my games as well as a few new additions like Fruit Ninja w/accuracy, MJ Experience, Child of Eden, and Gunstringer.     In my living room with a max of 7.5 feet. I am perfect. If you have 6.5 feet between you and the sensor you should be a-ok. It could detect all of me within about 3 feet and I'm 6'3\\" and I am a big boy. About 6.5 feet was the furthest the kinect calibration had me standing with the calibration card. I guess the 40% space reduction is right on. Couldn't be happier.    Just an fyi. Microsoft is supposedly working on a software update for kinect that will greatly improve the accuracy. The big M has already said they do not recommend the zoom, but so far the four games I tried it with were working perfectly. I have not tried Your Shape, but I bet the measurements will be off a little.
0553801473|1.0|I'm afraid I had to give up on this one about 200 pages in, a fair achievement still though as that's as much as many books have in total! But in this one I was only about a quarter of the way. I've not read any of this guy's books before but I love fantasy and saw that everybody was raving about this so I had to try it. It starts well, I love detailed description of new worlds and for a while I enjoyed all the detail but it soon became a drag and I found myself skipping sections try to get to the point where something actually happens. It didn't. Just lots of head-hopping, switching characters on me, which I always find annoying. Having recently read [[ASIN:1908200308 Lancelot And The Wolf]] which by contrast is edgy and succinct (and VERY brave!), I was hoping for something similar.<br />I'm sure Martin enjoys his world building but to me it's just tedious.
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus isn't your average circus story. There aren't three rings, there isn't a top hat wearing ringmaster bellowing cues, and horses don't happily prance in circles. This circus feels more like a joint-produced Tim Burton and Audrey Niffenegger spectacle. Full of dark, twisty lines and an ominous feel. Nothing can be explained, yet no one wants an explanation to make the enchantment feel less real. (Actually, the book very much reminded me of Her Fearful Symmetry, with a dash of Big Fish's magic.)     Le Cirque des Rêves arrives without warning, as the story starts. Overnight, a town's empty field is magically filled with black and white tents, all connected by a snaking sidewalk. It's only open at night, and it's worth staying up late for. Because inside, the unexplainable happens. Each small tent has its own act. There's the acrobat tent, where trapeze artists fly above the spectator's heads; the lion tamer's area; a tent full of ice; a tent that lets guests jump from cloud to cloud; and the illusionists tent, where audience members watch as the performer disappears and reappears.     But things aren't as they seem. Inside the circus, a battle is in place, one that was created years ago. Celia, the illusionist, is dueling with Marco, the owner's apprentice (who also happens to be an illusionist). They've both trained since childhood and, unknown to them, only one can be left standing. This is a place where illusions are real - things can change by using ones mind - and there's no slight-of-hand involved. So when they start falling for one another, things get complicated. And the fate of the entire circus lies in their hands.     A dramatic premise, sure, but it's deserved. The book asks for drama, with its black-spine pages and rich designs between chapters. The characters jump from the pages, having motivations of their own. There's a lot of belief infused as well. Without realizing it, you start to believe that magic is real. You start to feel like part of the circus, knowing the ins and outs of each tent, and which candy tastes best. You're a spectator wearing red to show your support of the black-and-white themed spectacle. It's an enthralling experience, reading the book.     The book is good, dead good. The prose is beautiful, and lets you easily visualize the wondrous things happening. It's engaging and captivating, everything you could hope for in a work of fantasy. Taking place in the late 1800s, early 1900s, it creates this historic, period feel that works. It puts a special touch to a time period that was missing hope and, well, magic. And the book was far from a simple love story. There are so many interweaving plots that Celia and Marco's tournament just become one part of a giant machine. (Granted, it's the glue that holds everything together, but still - the sub-plots are just as important and just as interesting.) The characters are amazing, and I even started to hope the circus was real, and that it would appear in my neighborhood next month.     I don't want to give away too much, because it's a book that needs to be devoured. It can't be spoiled, because there's so much involved. It's a book you need to read in a few days, despite its size; you can't leave it alone and come back to it. Stick with it and let yourself get wrapped in the warped, fantastical world.
0345444051|5.0|One of my all time favourites. This is a true first contact type novel, set in present day. If you want a well written and totally engaging read then look no further. Well written and doesn't rely on shock or space battles. This is very thoughtful with great characters who you care about. This is what V, Falling Skies etc all tried for and failed!
030788743X|5.0|READY PLAYER ONE an adventure story at heart, which I loved. After five years, a teenagers figures out the first clue of a puzzle. Not an adult, not a ruthless company, a TEENAGER. From there, the chase is on to see who can figure out the next clue. And the next. And along the way, there are millions of obstacles thrown in the path. And while some challenges felt too easy (like, really, how does anyone know that much about the 80s?), it was all good fun. Because you wanted him to win, no matter what.     But what I liked most about the book was that there was more to the characters. Aside from trying to find this egg, and gain control of the entire OASIS, they also had real feelings - friendships, relationships, enemies. With such a fake world around them, the real emotions showcased were refreshing. It reminded you that humanity still exists, even if it's a bit disguised.     The author does a great job at creating this futuristic America that feel so...frighteningly real. I mean, I can see our country going in this direction, and that's awful. A world where the best interaction is one found online. A world where people don't care to step outside anymore, because their \\"real world\\" is inside a computer. Second Life is mighty popular, after all.     And while the majority of the story does take place inside this virtual world, there is real danger afoot. It felt cheap at first - if a player's character dies on the OASIS, they can just create a new one. No harm done, right? Wrong. As the game progresses, real world dangers become more apparent, and the characters have more at stake. I really liked that. It gave the story more of an edge.     So who's this book for? Definitely a child of the 80s. References are on every page, from video game characters to movie lines. And while they do play a major role, I honestly think someone with not as much familiarity with the time period will enjoy it. While you may not get an offhand comment, you'll still get the plot. I can see this being, much like Little Brother by Cory Doctorow, a cult book for young adults as well. (Fun fact: Cory Doctorow is actually mentioned in the book.)    But mostly, it's a book for anyone who likes a good adventure. But rather than racing through time or across foreign lands, this one takes place all within the computer. It's interesting to see how times have changed, and that an adventure can be completely virtual. But it is, and that doesn't take any amount of pleasure away from it. Truly, Ready Player One is a great book - one I can definitely see getting a huge following, especially after the movie is released.

B002VECLVO|5.0|I watched this on DVD last year and had the opportunity to watch it a second time today. I liked it very much the first time around, but the second viewing moved me so much that now, hours later I want to watch it again - and I will do just that tomorrow night. (with subtitles since I missed a few lines and don't want to again.)    It is an exquisite in every way: acting, directing, cinematography, art direction, costumes, soundtrack. Colin Firth should have won an Oscar for this, even if his 'The King's Speech' role was fine too - this performance however is on a whole different level. (He did win the Venice Film Festival award.)    I was stunned by the way to read that the film was shot in only three weeks (in Los Angeles, primarily Glendale and Pasadena I believe) and cost only 7 million, small change when it comes to movie making, even art house movies. There are too many films that take months and far more money to shoot and come out truly terrible nonetheless.     Colin Firth's performance is a master class in understated-yet-powerful acting. I've liked him ever since I saw him in \\"The English Patient\\" (1996) as Kristin Scott-Thomas husband, but here he is able to really shine in a role that has him on camera in virtually every scene. It's a tour de force of the kind that happens all to rarely in cinema; the kind that doesn't say \\"Look at me, look at me, aren't I brilliant?!\\", but rather communicates exactly what Isherwood surely must have wanted and most certainly what I would imagine Ford hoped for.     There is (male) nudity... but no sex in the film, and yet it is one of the most erotic films I've ever watched. It is a beautiful thing - even for this straight female - to watch masculine males show love, tenderness, and yes, lust. It doesn't hurt that Firth and Goode (and Hoult who is British yet does '1960s California Beach Boy' to perfection) are gorgeous, but their beauty never distracts the viewer from the performance as sometimes happens.    I've pretty much stopped buying DVDs since there are so few movies I care to watch a second time, even my faves. But 'A Single Man' is an exception and I will purchase it on DVD so as to be able to view it a few times a year...or more.     Here's hoping Tom Ford follows this up with a second feature as sublime as this one, but - as always - it will be a tough act to follow such a flawless first act. One thing is for certain: he should adapt someone else's work as he wisely chose to with his first feature. There's no denying that Isherwood's novel provided Ford with a gem - thankfully Ford knew just what to do with this gem, both in co-writing the screenplay and directing it.    A must see, whether you're female, male, straight or gay or Martian! In fact, my idea of the perfect straight man is someone who would be able to watch this film and not cringe one bit. From now on, any prospective LTR partner of mine will be secretly tested on our first date: if he has watched 'A Single Man\\" and truly loved it, he's my kinda guy!     Ford is a real Renaissance man: studied architecture originally, became a fashion designer and has now made one of the finest films ever - on his first try no less. Not bad.    Note: Ford has been with his male partner since 1986. Isherwood likewise was with painter Don Bachardy, 30 years his junior, for many years until his death.

0439023521|4.0|Very engaging novel. My eyes have been glued to it for the last couple days. Very suspenseful, full of action, romance, great plot all around. The reading level is for teenagers but once you get past that it keeps you entertained. I had mixed feelings about the constant plot twists, especially near the ending. It seemed like she was trying to put 2 different plot twists into one chapter to answer all the\\" what if this happened?\\" you would ask yourself when your reading it. It almost seemed like she couldn't decide how to proceed the story. But in order to make a series she had to do it in this way i guess. Another thing i didn't like were the characters names. Some of them are ok and i understand this story is placed sometime in the future. Katniss i can get over, i just call her Kat. But Petta, Cinna, Haymitch, etc. come on thoses are all stupid and dull names. when the movie comes out im going to laugh because Katniss is going to call out PETTA! in the middle of the forest and its going to sound like louis griffin shouting PETER!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|...I am aghast with the new changes.<br />I tried to keep an objective mind, and I thought I'd rather see for myself what the changes were about, and THEN form an opinion.<br />Needless to say, I'll pass up.<br /><br />The much maligned Vader scene is as bad as people have described. This is truly awful, not to mention unnecessary. This is downright laughable. The original moment was so powerful precisely because Vader's silence told so much about his inner conflict, looking back and forth at Luke and the Emperor, until he resolved it. Now we're left with a mock-up of George (the one from the Tex Avery's cartoons, not Lucas).<br />For that scene alone, it's reason enough to bypass this set.<br />I also lent an eye (or an ear, as the case might be) to the re-dubbed Dragon cry from Obi-wan. It sounds like someone had too much fun with the time-stretch function in Adobe Audition. It actually has a comical effect, by now.<br /><br />I didn't watch the supplementary changes. No need.<br /><br />This is a travesty, and I suggest you avoid it at all costs (or at least for $80).

0545259088|4.0|I thought this was a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy. It didn't quite have the happy ending I was expecting, but it leaves you with enough hope that it wasn't disappointing. There were a few loose ends left, nothing too major.<br /><br />If you haven't read the previous books, you might be a bit lost as to what's going on. It continues the story of Grace and Sam, teenagers who are in love--with one big obstacle in their way. Well, besides the fact that her parents refuse to believe they're really in love. The problem is, they were both bitten by wolves as children, and not just any wolves, but wolves infected with a virus that allows them to switch back and forth between human and wolf when the temperature shifts. (cold weather equals wolf, warm weather equals human) Now, in the first book, they discovered a cure--but it stands a good chance of killing you, rather than curing you. And as they find out, it's not really a cure after all. While trying to deal with the fact that there are new wolves in the pack who aren't following the rules, and a she-wolf who's gone insane, they must also face the swiftly approaching deadline, after which the wolves will be hunted down and slaughtered by a man whose son was bitten and--he believes--killed by the pack of wolves.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in the book, though the action swings back and forth between Sam, Grace, one of their friends, and the newest member of the pack, a teenage rock star named Cole. I found that I didn't care for the book quite as much as I did the first novel in the series. The first book, Shiver, had a vital essence to it, almost a poetry, a realism that was stark and beautiful, which created a constant urge to keep turning the pages. The second and third books in the series had more complicated plots, and less of the stark beauty. But they're still good.<br /><br />There were a few plot holes that I noticed, mainly why is Cole a human while all the others are still wolves? It didn't quite make sense to me. But I can overlook plot holes when the writing is so good. Another question I really wish had been addressed was the topic of the wolves mating. Surely they mate as wolves? It kind of implied that the connection between Grace and Sam remained even while they were both wolves, but it didn't really explore it. I would have loved to find out what would happen if a wolf got pregnant as a wolf, then turned human, or vice versa. Would the baby be human or wolf? Would it be werewolf? Or would it depend on who the father was? These are questions that burned through me as I read the book, but they were never explored.<br /><br />Four stars, simply because it doesn't quite measure up to the first book, yet is compelling in its own right.e make sense to me.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|I had pre-ordered mine like most and was extremely excited to try it last night, after about 10 minutes of messing around with it, the excited had gone.    It was very easy to connect and line up on the Kinect, after switching the unit on, I was surprised  not to see much of the picture in the little preview screen, I had heard about the fishbowl effect but was not expecting it to be that large of an effect. Anyways, I went in to the calibration screen with my card, found I had to move closer to calibrate, which I was thinking was the whole point of this unit was I was still excited ;-)    Next, went in to the tracking, found the right location.. good, next the games.    First, I tried fruit ninja, as it only uses a simple tracking system. Main screen loads up, says calibrating.. shows me, but it looks like I'm missing an arm, so I moved slightly, comes up again saying calibrating, I only moved about 2 inches... still the same problem, so I do the hand down by my side and rise the other one to get the tuner up and my hand cursor on the screen is going nuts!! It's flipping left and right, up and down, like a crazy person. I tried moving around, still didn't help so I powered of the XBOX, started it again and waved at the Kinect to start the hub. Again, as soon as the hub came up, the hand went crazy.    So I used the hand controller, went in calibrate again, went to hub, same issue...     Removed the Zoom, hand movement back to normal.. reconnected crazy hands...    Maybe I just got a bad unit seeing that others have had no problems but according to Amazon when I try to do a return with replacement it says out of stock and will only offer money refund....    If anyone wants to give my ideas to try before I send it back, post a comment.

0547396945|5.0|I can't count how many times we've read this book. My older daugther (5) has it memorized and \\"reads\\" it to her little sister (2). The drawings are sweet and whimsical. The repetition of \\"But where is the green sheep\\" makes them both giggle. One of our all time favorites!
0061726826|5.0|Beautifully written, dystopian teen lit.  Oliver does a lovely job and crafting a novel that should appeal to teens and adults alike.  In a not so distant world where love is a dirty word, Lena (short for Magdalena)is about to graduate from high school and getting ready for \\"the procedure\\" that will ensure she NEVER becomes infected.  With love.  And then she does.<br /><br />Oliver ever so tenderly inserts poetry and music into this really wonderful novel that transcends genre (sure, its dystopian, but it speaks to the human condition in so many ways).  I was slow to get started with what seemed initially another teen adventure in the world after....but became so much more.  Highly recommend.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Excellent movie with a new story line that worked.Great acting and animation. Glad they're keeping up the super heroe movies. Have fun!!
0439023491|3.0|After the excitement and novelty of The Hunger Games, Catching Fire was a bit of a let down.  We come to discover the main character Katniss is actually a pretty annoying person. The world revolves around her, her hair, clothing and skin are picture perfect and shiny new, and She and only She can save her world and all her loved ones from destruction!  Dum dum dummmmmm....<br /><br />It opens with a lot of reflection on what has happened in Katniss' life since she and Peeta predictably won the Hunger Games.  First, she has been given a full body makeover and is now pimped out around the Districts on national TV as a sort of party favor/pet.  If there were an Oprah in the Capitol, Katniss would be her \\"hero of the week\\".  This has all apparently gone to her head, and she now believes her own hype: whatever she says, whatever she does, what she wears and the relative state of her eyebrow grooming will ultimately control the fate of the Rebellion in the Districts.<br /><br />This is epitomized by her continued pretense of being in love with Peeta.  In my opinion this plot device, their fake love affair, has never really been adequately supported.  In the first book they pretended to be in love to give their characters from the boring, poor, perpetual-loser District 12 a bit of \\"spice\\" to get the audience interested.  That I understood.  A lot of luke warm kissing ensued.  They were playing to the audience, their viewers, and to get special presents sent down in times of extreme need. The endgame of book 1, with the faked berry suicide attempt, could either have been seen to the viewing audience as rebellious against the government or an act of tragic love - and even after watching Katniss and Peeta fake falling in love, the viewers were somehow still convinced that the suicide threat was an act of rebellion against the government.  And this became the main thrust of the continued \\"love affair\\" of Catching Fire, as Katniss and Peeta go on National TV to convince the country of their love.  As weak a premise as this is, Katniss and Peta are now fake-engaged.  A fake-pregnancy is also announced.  The evil President Snow has threatened Katniss and convinces her that only if she fakes love better than she did before will she quell the unrest in the Districts.<br /><br />Eventually we learn that this is an Anniversary year for the Hunger Games and historically these years contain more gruesome or shocking events than ever.  Engaged Katniss and Peeta, while planning their fake wedding, are basically thrust back into the Hunger Games Redux about 2/3 of the way through the story.  And here the author seems to rely on the plot elements that made the first book in the series so engaging to carry this second book along to its limping finish.  Again with the beauty makeovers.  Again with the Gamekeepers.  Again with Katniss getting an even more amazing score than last year.  Again with the good cop/bad cop Mentor Haymitch.  Again with what is essentially Katniss using Peeta's genuine love for her as a security blanket.  Again with the outfits and Cinna and \\"the team\\".  Honestly what was emotionally moving in the first book was not present in the sequel; instead of the dread, the outrage and the fear at a cruel gory-death-as-entertainment system that felt akin to people being fed to the lions in a Roman forum while spectators shouted for blood, we have a sort of limp and gimmicky reprise of the events leading to their arrival in the arena and the brief introduction of about ten new characters that end up to remain largely 2 dimensional for the remainder of the book.<br /><br />Another issue I have is the \\"I must save Peeta!  I must sacrifice my life for him!\\" theme the author gives Katniss in this book.  It is not, in my opinion, ever adequately explained.  Peeta is a nice if bland guy who seems to genuinely care about the self-centered and melodramatic Katniss - and that's it.  He has no family to support.  No one depends upon him for food orsafety.  He is not the \\"face\\" of the rebellion.  He has no special survival skills. He has no weapons training.  Katniss on the other hand has a family to support and who depend on her, including her sister, a young child; she has become the \\"face\\" of the rebellion, she has survival skills, she has weapons training, she can hunt and kill and walk softly in woods and strategize and people apparently look at each of her actions as a sign of what to do next.  However in Book 2 we are to believe that she needs to sacrifice herself to \\"save Peeta at all costs!\\" and Katniss makes quite a big martyr deal about this throughout the entire story.  She makes a hash of it as it happens - if the rest of the secret allies didn't literally carry Peeta bodily through the arena, he'd have been dead - but still at the end she narrates a lot of dying speeches about the Importance of Peeta to the Cause.  It was silly.<br /><br />The book closes with the end of this Anniversary edition of the Hunger Games and some new info about the rebellion.  I won't spoil it, but readers won't be overly surprised when they read the result.  As I'm partway through Book 3 now, I see the second book is essentially a filler that takes the readers from Book 1 to Book 3 - the Open to the Close - with plot devices to introduce a few characters that are necessary to carry the story arc forward.  And as such, if you intend to read the 3 book series I recommend just plowing through Catching Fire and taking the basics of it away with you to move forward.safety.

0553801473|5.0|Not finished reading yet, but so far its up to its prequels. Though longer, it continues storylines from Feast, so its good.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|A fantastic cd with an amazing track 'Fragile' however I am so enjoying the brilliant playing on all the tracks and I am not that into modern day music.  These two chaps put their heart and soul into playing their wonderful instruments, achieving sounds with such depth and vivacity. The more I play it, the more I love it.
0345529057|5.0|I don't typically write Amazon reviews, however I felt compelled after seeing all the poor reviews about the books' quality. The reviews seem recent, but perhaps they've already fixed the problem. My boyfriend bought this box set for us to share. He reads a book and then passes them on to me. So far, we've had zero issues. No pages falling out, no poorly cut pages, no missing pages - and these books are being passed around, pulled in and out of our bags on the subways, and stuffed into my a pinch-too-small bag. The only clue that they've been loved is the color coming off on the cover along the edges of the binding.     Don't let those one stars keep you from enjoying this fabulous series!
0891419063|5.0|This is the best book on the life of a WWII Marine/Soldier that I've ever read....it's absolutely fantastic!  You'll feel like you lived through it yourself!
B005COO1X6|1.0|This is a short story and the first third  of the yarn is just \\"ok\\"...while the remainder  is CRUD...silly....stupid. I agree with the  other one-star reviewers.
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|It does the job.  It has a squishy feel, softer than other iPhone cases I've tried.  It took it a bit getting used to the feel, but now I like it.   The only thing I don't like about the case is that the front lip doesn't stick to the phone real well -- it feels like it's going to peel off.  That said, it's become my everyday iPhone case, replacing several other more expensive choices.  If you want something that feels solid, this isn't for you.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus, by Erin Morgenstern, is a sensual, magical fantasy. It's set in the 1870s, but it's also set before that, after that, and during the modern times. Naturally, it's set in a circus, and in London, and in New York, and also in all the places that circuses, go, which in the case of this circus, is absolutely anywhere, at anytime, because of course;    \\"The circus arrives without warning...\\"    What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? I wasn't aware of the buzz surrounding this book until I followed a link from Echo Bazaar (a steampunk RPG browser game) to a mysterious browser game called, appropriately enough, The Night Circus. At first I thought that it was just a game, a very odd game, until I explored enough that I realized that it was just an introduction to the book! It definitely makes an interesting companion to the book.    So you can see, I was a reveur before I knew there was a book.    About the book. Like I said, what else can I say about the book? It's enchanting, it's sensual, it's mysterious, it's magical. There are many threads that come together, and part, and come together again. At the same time, the book is describing your own journey through the Circus. That's not a metaphor, that is actually something that is happening in the book.    One thing I applaud The Night Circus on is that it doesn't do what some avante garde books do, leaving a trailing ending and thinking that they're being very clever by doing so. The Night Circus is a story that has a ambiguous beginning and a circuitous path, but the end is very final, and all the loose ends are tied up. Maybe not in the knots you like, but there's nothing left dangling.    If I have a complaint, it's not about the book. It's about the fact that a 400 page e-book is being sold for 12.99$. If I hadn't already been in love with the book, that would have definitely given me pause. As it is, I still think that it's an awful lot to ask. I'll pay it. But it's a lot toask.    Please buy this book, and please enjoy it, and I'll see you at the Night Circus.
0596809158|5.0|R is a hard programming language to learn, in part because of its unconventional syntax and terminology relative to more mainstream languages, and also because it comes with thousands of functions and untold number of installable packages.  This book provides a very useful roadmap to a core of R capabilities.   It's organized into a series of related 'recipes' which provide clear explanations of the problem being solved, R code for solving the problem, and an explanation of what the R code is doing.  I recommend it highly!
B005HG4C4C|5.0|I love this album. I wasn't sure what to expect but I was very surprised. It has a very refreshing sound. It sounds very much like old Dream Theater but with certain differences. I can tell Jordan Rudess had a heavy influence on this album. His keyboard work is probably the most prominent in this album versus others. Mike Mangini is excellent. The guy was my pick from the beginning. Mainly because of his work with Steve Vai on Fire Garden. To me Mr. Petrucci kind of took a slight step to side on this one. This allowed Jordan to stand out more as I stated earlier. Don't get me wrong you can definitely hear his presence and some of his solos remind me of earlier days. In fact some of it sounds heavier at times. I am amazed yet again. One of my favorite tracks is Breaking All Illusions. The whole album is worth listening to. Make your own opinion.
1857885082|5.0|I grew up in the US but have lived in the UK for 17 years and, as my parents are Japanese (I have lived in Japan and Hong Kong) I feel I have a fairly multicultural outlook.  As Kate Fox herself points out near the end of the book, there are a lot of cultural similarities between the Japanese and the English which I spotted right away and also, I think, guides a lot of my own behavior.    The book is engaging, well-written and very funny, yet seriously researched and credible as an anthopological study.  While I feel I knew a lot about the English, I learned even more.  Non-UK readers note: English is NOT the same as British.    Highly recommended for expats, travellers, anglophiles and anglophobes.

B004LWZW4C|1.0|Didn't play on my Samsung 6900 so spent an hour trying to figure out. See the other posts about erasing the BD data and turning the internet off. Worked for me.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I got this CD when it first came out stateside. There was a lot of hype over it already and the lucky UK had already been able to enjoy it for about a month. Upon first listen I was disappointed. I do not know why, maybe it was the anticipation kept me unable to appreciate the songs or maybe it just truly is a cd that grows on you each and every time you listen to it.    I love this cd so much still. Even with the first single getting played out on the radio, I still genuinely enjoy every song on the cd. For the first two months it was the only thing I listened to on my way to and from work. Every single day I had a new favorite song. I even truly enjoyed the cover of The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\". Maybe because 311 butchered it before?    If you have someone resisted the urge to purchase this cd, relent! I can honestly say it is my favorite cd start to finish. Good work Adele, you killed it.
0307887898|5.0|The first reason I like this book is that my laptop's not waterproof, so I don't read the Eric Ree's blog in the bath. This is a problem for me because I find his lessons so profoundly usefull that so I'd rather absorb them in quiet solitude, not the hectic environment of most of my daily life. Part of my 5 star rating is because of the content and message, I'm a fan.    The second reason is by iterating over all his writings from the last couple of years, he's made them more condensed, consolidated and cohesive. Simply better resolved, a more mature product. So for me it was genuinely enjoyable 'preach to the choir'; affirmative, confidence boosting, enthusiasm-renewing (like I need it :). An enjoyable read.    Finally, and most importantly, the book is very accessible. I'm a cranky and impatient man with mediocre people skills,  perpetually dismayed at the lack of gratitude from colegues when I kindly point out an obviously better way. I expect coppies of this book will be a usefull tool in getting them to think clearly about what matters and how to find out about making it happen, rather than being paralysed by fear and stuck on counterproductive behavior. I think the book will be usefull going forwards.

B005J0VPNC|5.0|The app has been updated to the latest version, the same as the Android Market. You can now convert any picture already in your phone's memory not just new pictures you take with the app. This means you have full flash and zoom compatibility if you take the pic with your camera and then convert it with the app. I'm really digging this app.
B00005Y7GQ|1.0|Maybe someone will like this movie out there, not me...  I have no clue where they were going with it, it is not in English, and it is just a bad movie.  Someone had recommended it to me because I like soccer, but it has nothing to do with soccer.
0763644765|5.0|I bought this book to read to my 2 year old daughter to start discussing potty training.  She loves the book, the pictures are cute, it doesn't get too graphic.  It's perfect for what I wanted it for.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I had read the negative reviews of this movie and watched it seeking out things that would irritate me. Did I find them? Yes, but I feel they were inconsequential as I was caught up in the story right from the start and ended up liking the movie! It seems those who hated this movie just didn't get it. It's not purported to be an adaptation of P and P, it's the story of Amanda's fantasy of being plunged into the book and the plot twists and characterizations are all her doing. Contrary to what some thought, it seemed to me that Amanda did a good job adapting to her environment. Sure she reverted to 21st century expression at times, but think about it: She lived 20-some years in the modern world and like 5 minutes in the 19th century. Who could possibly achieve a complete character overhaul instantly? As for the twisting of the original story of Pride and Prejudice, I found it intriguing. Why not take all of those characters and say, What If? How might they have behaved under different circumstances? Again, while you may not agree with the directions they went, this is how Amanda crafted it in her fantasy world. Personally I thought the snobby haughty rude character being outed as a closet lesbian was hilarious. One thing that did bug me was the absence of Bingley's other sister and her husband. I know they were not critical to the storyline, but considering that Amanda claims to have read the book over and over till it was almost a part of her, you would think there would be at least a mention of 2 characters who were present in many scenes of the original book. All in all, I think the folks who hated this movie have got some prejudice of their own to examine. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The reason it only deserves 4 stars is that it's a bit long to sit through and because there are little annoyances throughout, but overall it's good entertainment. Just keep your mind open!

B0054PSY2W|1.0|The picture will cut off on the sides at certain points in the movie in many of the night scenes. Also the top black bar will come down into the picture at times ruining the viewing pleasure. There is no quality control, and the company making these discs should be shot. They put this crap out, and expect you to live with it. This is not the only movie I've gotten on blu ray with this problem. Stay away... keep your regular formatted dvd. This is a bad traaansfer!

B0034G4P80|5.0|Thor has real emotional depth way beyond what you would expect. It also has action and special effects second to none. After a while and because of the turn in story, you don't really think about those amazing effects, and that's a good thing. Instead, you're pulled into a story about people and that's a great thing.    I like this comicbook anti-hero fallen god.  He's gritty, primal, vain yet noble and somehow more real. The film does a great job of showing us how an arrogant son can come to grips with who and what he truly is. The movie draws the audience in with its confidence and it never lets you go. There's no doubt that Natalie Portman was an important piece of casting because she brings the story down to earth. Thor meets Portman's Jane Foster after he is banished from the home of the gods to live among mortals. The audience can relate to what Jane is experiencing and it grounds the film perfectly. That makes the action seem more real and that's a tough balancing act. There are plenty of scenes that you have to see to believe!  This movie actually has a heart and a soul and a brain and I couldn't have asked for anything more.    I'd rather a movie be too cerebral then too dumb.  This film succeeds on a basic level. It jumps the boundaries of its genre to pull in viewers with originality and inventiveness. Calling it a standard action film doesn't do it justice. It's surprisingly deep and takes the time to set itself up.  A complete movie that really doesn't belong in the summer with the likes of the brainless films you know are going to hit soon. This is one I couldn't wait to own on DVD.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|There are no special features on these blue-rays just some old audio commentaries. Compare this set to the great back to the future blu-ray box set which on each blu-ray has three hours of special features. Granted the picture and sound are better than the old dvds but thats it.
B004LWZW42|5.0|An outstanding effort, what a superb early summer this has been! The characters, effects, and story were all beyond great.  Bryan Singer is back and it clearly showed. Add Vaughn's touch and both display an amazing vision that rivals that of the now classic X2. They manage to keep the story intense and flowing but filled with depth and heart. They also kept an eye on what has come before without being burdened or overly tied to it. If you've never seen any x-film, you'll still love this movie. That said, it builds for another installment and I absolutely can't wait to see it and to see where we go next. The Singer and Vaughn team also manages to deliver a little bit of everything, and I mean EVERYTHING.  There's intrigue, romance, conspiracy, drama, conflict, historical context, retro flavor, fun, humor and of course, kick butt comic book style slugfests.      I think this is now the best comic book movie summer ever (even though it's not even officially summer yet) and I'm not exaggerating. 2008 was great but I think we have a new king. Thor was pure greatness and Captain America looks superb. This was the only question mark from Marvel's stable and they absolutely hit it out of the park. Erick and Charles are now given room to thrive and breathe, find their own voice and their own distinctiveness. The plot becomes more intricate as the situations become more dire. Not many adaptations have ever dug as deep as First Class. These are truly some of the most complex characters I've ever seen in a super hero based movie. They're a group of characters who are so well written and full of small, personal moments that they match the best of their rich, four-color origins. They become living, breathing people whom have pasts, presents and futures and I can't wait to see where this new cast takes us from this point forward.     I love this youger Xavier and the fact that his youthful flaws are fully on display. Charles is caught up in himself as most people are in their youth.  He is proud and confident young man, and he's ceratinly not the selfless person that we saw in the X-Men trilogy.  I love the fact that the writers were smart enough to convey these elements and show a young man in need of growth. They easily could've made him a \\"mini me\\" version of Patrick Stewart's Xavier. Instead they went much deeper and the result is much more interesting.  Charles'  relationship with Raven/Mystique is facinating especially when you compare both character to what they will become later. She's an assistant to him and he cares for her, but his ego causes unintended consequences. At times, Charles gives off a condescending, big-brother attitude and that fits so well to the growth the character needs to undertake. You see it in the way he treats the others. In the trilogy, he's exorcised that from his personality. Here, his ego is on a par with Magneto and that makes for an interesting dynamic.     Overall, just like X2, I had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie.
1589946634|5.0|After getting through the cumbersome rules I have been able to play the solitaire game five times.  Out of those, I've only managed to beat it once. This game is hard, but for me that's what makes it fun. If I'm able to beat it everytime I play, it doesn't give me an incentive to come play it again. Do not let the supplied rules discourage you from playing this fun game. There are some resources online that can help you out. There's a condensed rules sheet on boardgamegeek that was very helpful for me. I liked this game so much I ordered the 2 expansions for it (mission pack 1 and marine pack 1). Definitely recommended.

B000M343BM|5.0|As an Australian, Major League was my first introduction to baseball way back in 1992. Despite knowing very little about the game, this film is where my love for baseball started.  A key premise to the film is that a team of struggling baseball players has been hired to help contribute to the demise of the club (the Cleveland Indians); on the basis that their failure will allow the club to be relocated.  As a team of misfits they warm the heart as all-time underdogs, and this group of battlers and unique personalities are a humorous and entertaining lot. Their status as underdogs makes them inspiring, and you don't have to be a baseball person to enjoy the film.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author

078322611X|5.0|Field of Dreams has an original storyline and themes that extend beyond baseball, which are deeply moving.  This film delves into a world of fantasy; where baseball appears to be the driving force of this desire. Yet baseball is only the vehicle that allows for the realization of dreams, which has profound benefits for all those who allow themselves to imagine.  What commences as a noble act by Iowa Farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), which is to provide a facility for the spirit of deceased legendary baseball players; to play the game they love, is in fact an opportunity for Ray to fill a missing part of his life with fulfillment, which was lost as he grew up.  This is a film that will make you believe that what is lost in life is never lost in dreams.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author
B004Y1USJE|5.0|This is a tight, professional sounding, work of art.  I love the old yes and have listened to them since the 70's.  I really enjoy the old stuff, but it was refreshing to hear some more down to earth Yes.  The word are what really impressed me.  I can clearly understand the meaning of them.  Although it is still abstract, and jazzlike, with lots of odd time signatures, it is more straight up rock and roll.  Hour of Need is a great song.  It shows Yes being musicians who can tighten up and play a simple song.  I know many Yes fans yern for long, drawn out, masterpieces, but this is not what they feel like playing.  You can tell they are having a great time.  Chris Squire is monstrous on the bass, similar to Drama.  David sounds almost exactly like Trevor Horn.  I am not going say he can sing like Jon, but he allows the band to really hit home. I wouldn't want another ten albums like this, and enjoy their overall career, but I must say, crank this baby through a good stereo, so the bass can be heard well, and you will find yourself having a great time.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|The return of an old friend.  The movie didn't exactly follow the series, but it was a very enjoyable tie in. If you liked Firefly, you will enjoy this movie.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|I enjoyed the convenience of ordering online and having the product delivered. I didnt worry cause I trust Amazon. The DVD's were in mint condition as well - this was especially appreciated - I could just sit down and view with no problems.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|This is a great addition to any BEEGEES collection.The music is wonderful and the book is really great. I enjoyed reading all about the group.
B0055EAJ7A|3.0|There are already plenty of movie reviews but I'm surprised no one had commented on the 3D version.  In a word: disappointing.  You know you're not getting your money's worth when the most visually sophisticated sequence of the whole movie is the end credits.  The Asgard portions do look nice with high contrast colors and depth of perception but for much of the rest, the 3D effect is either hardly noticeable (for all the action on earth) or actually detrimental (frost giant sequences are too dark to be viewed in 3D).  So unless you're a collector, save your $$ and enjoy the regular BD.

B001R4CKGU|1.0|Don't waste your money on this book. The plot is slow, poorly connected. The book is slow and the story does not thread together. I cannot believe this won awards. As one other reader commented, the only benefit is that it is short.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Made with an estimated budget of $200,000,000, \\"Green Lantern\\" certainly looks nice. It also has an interesting cast including Ryan Reynolds, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett and Tim Robbins, and is directed by Martin Campbell, who had successfully rebooted the 007 franchise twice (with \\"GoldenEye\\" and \\"Casino Royale\\"). So, \\"Green Lantern\\" should have been a great film, but somehow it ended up with a good film held back from greatness by the inept script. A film with four names in its writing credits is not always destined to be inconsistent and mediocre, I know, but watching \\"Green Lantern\\" almost made me feel that way.    The film opens with a brief history of the intergalactic police force Green Lantern Corps, followed by the main story about a fearless (or reckless) test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds), who is chosen by a power ring of fatally wounded Green Lantern member Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) as his successor. So far, the film keeps a good pace.    But apparently the filmmakers couldn't decide in what way the story should be developed. \\"Green Lantern\\" tries to tell us so many things at the same time - Hal Jordan's romance with Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), and what he has to learn as a recruit to the Green Lantern Corps; tormented Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) and his descent into the dark side; and the impending danger from fear-eating Parallax. It's like checking the list of problems the third \\"Spider-man\\" film suffered.     I like the light-hearted tone of Green Lantern,\\" especially its first half. I like the idea of Hal Jordan creating constructs (like a green-colored catapult to protect the people). There is also an amusing scene sending up the famous balcony scene of the Superman. They may be silly, but fun nonetheless.     But with its uneven pace (Hal Jordan's training period on Planet Oa is very short) and underwritten characters (Tim Robbins as Senator Robert Hammond, Hector's father, is wasted), I couldn't help feeling that there seems to be a much better movie buried in \\"Green Lantern.\\"
0316017930|5.0|I finally got around to reading Outliers, I'm a fan of Gladwell's other books, and this one may have been his best work yet.  I've long held the belief that most of our actions are half chance and our \\"success\\" highly depends on others, just as much as it does ourselves.  Gladwell's writing and research supports this opinion and shows the relationship between hard work and luck.  It is certainly a book that will make you think twice about how we view the world, and will provide you a better understanding of how society functions going forward.    Gladwell presents the reader with numerous examples to support his point.  Whether it be deep rooted cultural issues, or socio-economic issues, Gladwell expertly navigates the ideas of success, mastership, and luck in ways rarely discussed.    A must read for anyone who has ever liked to peek below the surface on how society works.

1446301583|3.0|I own all the \\"tilda\\" books and I have to say that I was disappointed.  There are several pictures of ideas and less sewing in each of the newer books with even less new ideas.  I do like some of the new patterns the cupcake angel and the elephant and giraffe were great however I havent seen a giraffe at a circus.  I also didnt like the feel of this book while it had the same classyness as her Sew Sunny Homestyle it lacked the country feel that I love.  And be aware the clothes they mention in the editorial review are for the angels in the book and not for humans.  This was a bummer since I was expecting clothes for me or my kids.
B0041T52S6|5.0|this movie is a guilty pleasure, it is a must see, and michael cera comes through. whomever directed this movie, borrowed a lot from anime, video games, kevin smith, and from kill bill.  it is a must see.  if you are having a bad day, this is the movie to watch.

0439023521|5.0|The country of Panem consists of 13 districts, out of which 12 still stand. 13th was eradicated after the rebellion towards the Capitol, and ever since - to keep remaining districts in line - the Capitol throws The Hunger Games. A girl and boy are from each District is picked to play through lottery - play until only one of the 24 players is alive. The players must be between 12 and 18 years old.<br /><br />In District 12 Katniss has learned to survive and provide for her family after her father's death by hunting outside the fence, which is illegal, but has fed her mother and her little sister Prim. As the Hunger Games lottery day is upon them, it is Prim who's name is pulled out and Katniss cannot see any other way to save her sister except take her place in the games. Katniss is joined by Peeta a baker's son, and together, yet apart, they have to face the games.<br /><br />The world is gritty dystopian, where the ruling class rules and the people follow. The mandatory Hunger Games is a disgusting idea, setting people against each other, no setting kids, against each other.<br /><br />Modern society, atleast western, sees this as such a taboo that I can see why this book is so popular. I mean what would you do? Could you enter the games and not kill if your life depended on it? Could you defend yourself till death? Could you stay invisible and wait until others finish themselves off? How would you survive being hunted? Would you come out of it sane if you did win?<br /><br />Wonderfully written, engaging and colored beautifully with survival vs. morals. This book has me complitely addicted, and cannot wait to read the second instalment! I have had this book on the back of my mind since Stephanie Meyer recommend it to her fans few years back. I can see why she was excited about it as well.<br /><br />I'd like to think I'd have the strength Katniss has if I'd be in her shoes. If the world would collapse back to early 1900's and became a police state I hope I'd be able to handle myself. That is the kind of ideas this book gives, and I think people learning to hunt or gather thanks to this book may actually save some lives which is great accomplishment.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book yet, do so, it's amazing!ideas this book gives, and I think people learning to hunt or gather thanks to this book may actually save some lives which is great accomplishment.    If you haven't read this book yet, do so, it's amazing!

B004J4XGN6|5.0|Love the author's definition of a startup: \\"an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty\\". Too often we approach entrepreneurship as either an accounting exercise or wishful creativity. The reality is neither. Entrepreneurship is the skillful management of chaos. Implementing thees ideas means setting aside \\"founder's ego\\" and focusing on the discipline of execution, which is hard because the culture of many startups is ego-driven. I  recommend this book, whether your startup is technology or something else.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|I pre-ordered and received yesterday. I anxiously tried it out, hoping to be able to stand closer to the kinect. Alas, looks like the product is fundamentally flawed. The Infrared picture is totally dark start with, and the kinect tries to increase the contrast. Was able to see me OK, but the hand tracking was EXTREMELY erratic to the point of being UNUSABLE. Painfully went through the Calibration process a few times. Sometimes, the Kinect would complain that it could not see the floor. Sometimes, it could see it OK, and calibrated fine using the card. However, when I try to play any game, just getting it started is a chore, since the hand movements are barely successfully tracked. I thought this was because the room was not too well lit (I have two lamps in front, none in the back), so I tried it again this morning. Same results. Calibrated OK, but could not even get a game going. Looks like the IR light is severely attenuated by the lens, so the kinect can only barely see me in IR. I will be trying some more tests when I get back home tonight, but so far, the verdict is that this is a total NO GO for me. If it is like this again tonight, I will be returning the unit to Amazon.    UPDATE AFTER FURTHER EXPERIMENTATION:    I think I figured out why the reviews are so bipolar. I have my Kinect mounted ABOVE the TV, because that is what works best in a limited space. However, the Zoom seems to work best when the sensor is BELOW the TV. I unmounted mine and placed it below, and went through the whole calibration routine again. Now, I was actually able play some GAMES! How about that. Played with Kinect Sports (Soccer, Ping Pong), Kinect Adventure (Reflex Ridge) and some Dance Central (just the basic Poker Face). It all played OK, with me standing about 3-4 feet from the sensor. HERE is an additional catch: when the sensor shows if you are in the \\"good\\" or \\"best\\" position in the game, try to stand back as far as the room allows so it thinks you are farther behind. Then,when the game starts go ahead and move up front. It seems to work best this way. Perhaps the initial distance determination is by some kind of an ultrasound range finder, and that can't be fooled by a lens, but the subsequent computations are based upon the IR field, which IS influenced by the lens. Also, the IR reflection is stronger the closer you are to the device, so it works better.    Anyway, I am revising my stars to 2 because I could actually enjoy some game play with this thing. However, Nikko should have warned about the fact that this ONLY works for sensors mounted below the TV,  and that too only in a limited fashion. I still have trouble getting it to recognize a hand wave even in the lower position. Takes me a while, but once it does, it seems to go better from that point. ALL REVIEWERS: Please state where your Kinect is mounted along with your review, thanks!    FINAL UPDATE:    I tried various games last night. Even in the lower position, hand tracking is very erratic. On some games it is totally unacceptable. For example, in Child of Eden, the hand tracking is critically important, and with this thing, you keep shooting at the wrong time, totally spoiling the fun of the game. At this point, I have given it the largest measure of the \\"benefit of doubt\\" and am giving up. I just filed for an RMA. Oh well, it was such a nice idea. I believe the only way this will work is if MS creates a supported update firmware that recomputes the geometry based on this new optics, or comes out with a version of their own (Kinect 2?).
B004LWZW42|5.0|Excellent movie. One of the best movies I've seen all yr, and I'm not even a big fan of superhero films. I know this film wasn't hugely successful at the box office, but I really hope they make a sequel. I'd like to see them  continue this series of prequels for another film or two.
B0058VA2U4|2.0|I dont know, I was really looking forward to this and three listens in and it sounds like some outtakes from the Presistance Of Time recordings...If you listen to the newest Megadeth, Overkill, Slayer, Exodus and Testament (bands that have been around for the same amount of time) recordings you will see that these bands captured a fresh modern sound which seems to be lacking on this Anthrax release.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|In some ways, despite its Oscar nomination for best picture, this was quite the disaster. Though the acting is good, and the set design and cinematography lovely, the problem lies in the changes to the original short story it was taken from, which was profound and eloquent, and often hilarious, particularly in the story's opening pages, where we meet Benjamin born as a full-sized old man, with all his cranky faculties in tact :-) Why the filmmakers decided to abandon the original ideas of the classic story and create a BB character that, to my way of thinking, seemed like one of the most boring and lifeless persons (personality-wise) to ever occupy the screen, I'll never know. And the movie is slow. Not that I mind slow in the least; some of my favorite films are slow in a beautiful, mesmerizing way, just not this kind of slow. As one late-night comedian put it: \\"Over the weekend, I went to see The Curious Case of Benjamin ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...\\" That pretty much sums it up for me. At least director Fincher turned out a much smarter, much better product with his next film, \\"The Social Network.\\"
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Millions of dollars are spent by startups that build things that nobody ever really wants. This might seem shocking because the media narrative that appeals most to us is the one where a few kids in a dorm at Harvard have a simple idea and create a billion dollar business as a result.    Eric Ries reminds us in \\"The Lean Startup\\" that building a successful business requires constant validation of ideas and iteration in order to get to a point where success is really possible. This book aims to change the way that founders and venture capitalists think by making it okay to measure success by how much we learn about what works and what doesn't, instead of looking only at classic metrics.    The real lesson of the Lean Startup movement is one of humility and exploration. It teaches us to accept the reality that great ideas still need to be validated and proven in order to become real profitable businesses.
034552554X|5.0|Victoria Jones has grown up in the foster care system in California. Now she is eighteen years old and must make it in the world on her own. She has trouble relating to other people but feels a deep connection to flowers and even uses them to help her communicate with people. She manages to get a job with a florist and soon earns a reputation for being able to help people with their problems by choosing the right flowers for them. Along the way she meets a young man at a local flower market who forces her to confront a painful secret from her past.<br /><br />I loved this book for so many reasons. As a foster parent myself, I was both surprised and pleased that the portrayal of how the foster care system works is fairly accurate. This is no doubt because the author is also a foster parent.<br /><br />Victoria is deeply flawed yet utterly sympathetic. She has been tragically affected by her years in foster care and the author knows that a knight in shining armor or kindly floral shop owner is not going to magically make it all better overnight. It's hard to watch Victoria make the wrong choices but at the same time I appreciated the authenticity of the story.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD:<br /><br />I was very impressed by a section of the book where one of the characters is breastfeeding her new baby. The author perfectly portrays the wide range of emotions a new breastfeeding mother goes through - from feeling like you love the baby more than you thought possible to hating it for being a sucking parasite that is making you more sleep deprived than you ever thought you could be. I don't think I've ever read such a realistic representation of what it's like to have a new baby.<br /><br />END SPOILER<br /><br />This is Vanessa Diffenbaugh's first novel. I look forward to seeing what she comes up with next.
B0042VJK9U|2.0|So, Apparently Linkin Park is still popular in Japan. So Sunrise and Bandai made a special collaboration with them to release they own special Gundam<br /><br />the Gundam GP01Fb Linkin Park edition.<br /><br />now this is worth about 80 bucks on Amazon.<br /><br />But it's nothing more than a black version of the Gundam GP01Fb which costs about 20 dollars.  So your really over paying for a kit you could buy and paint black and a CD.<br /><br />This is not worth the 80 bucks.  If you can find it cheaper else where. Buy it else where.

B000SW2F8K|4.0|A fun, rollicking love story with Penelope Cruz and her two suitors, her husband (Murilo Benicio) in Brazil, and the producer (Mark Feuerstein) of her new cooking show in San Francisco. The theme of course is that Penelope like to be in charge, and on top, which infuriates the macho husband. In the end love prevails, and Penelope returns to her husband with some madcap scenes and compromises by both sides.  The scenery and music are great and the acting okay, not outstanding but enjoyable. I liked it as did my wife, over a glass of wine and the full moon glistening over the ocean.
B0034G4P8A|2.0|Plain and simple - when the humans show up the movie dies a slow death.    It's a superhero movie so you know what the plot is.  I read the comic, but just go to the Wiki page if you need a refresher. Hero comes to Earth to help humans. They're basically riffing Superman to the Nth degree here. But on to the important stuff...    Bad doo doo goes down, traitor to the throne, dueling brothers - yeah yeah, it's alright in the beginning.  Then he falls to earth and the movie pretty much is over.  What the heck is Natalie Portman doing in this movie. I mean that in two ways. First why is she even in the movie? Second, what did she do other than stand there and let her hair be blown around by the off screen wind machines? It felt like all of her scenes were filmed in one day and she looks so bored in all of them. Chris Hemsworth was fine as Thor and Hopkins played a good Odin, but it was the human characters that kill this one.    At least Branagh threw in Skarsgard for the Swede inside joke. But as usual Stellan Skarsgard is totally wasted. After Insomnia I was just in awe of what the man is truly capable of and here in the states they always use him as a window curtain.    I didn't mind the first act all that much, but for a movie about the GOD OF THUNDER, it comes off surprisingly meek.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Remember when director / producer, Steven Spielberg was the god of all hollywood? Remember when his movies had charm, scares, AND excitement? Remember JAWS? E.T.? CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND? POLTERGEIST?? Well, SUPER 8 is probably as close to those glorious days as we'll ever get! Filled w/ great characters (especially the kids), a perfectly-realized 1970s town, and an alien connection, S8 delivers those wonderful goosebumps that I haven't felt since I was a kid myself! Director J.J. Abrams and Producer Spielberg have brought back the magic! Hell, I damn near cried! Highly recommended...
0439023521|5.0|This book is utterly and unarguably one of the best books I have ever read. Collins does the most fantastic job describing and creating pictures of events that make me feel that I am there. When Katniss is in a tough bind, I can literally feel the adrenaline pumping fiercely, and visualize everything. For a long while I lost interest in a lot of books, and I think this is the most engaged I've ever been in a book since fourth grade. I can't put it down, and the sheer genius it posesses is incomparable. The way that this post-war and apocolyptic-like society runs raises so many questions that I bet she double sewed over the complex weave of the story to prevent any plot holes at all. This book is a ridiculously addictive read and I reccomend it to anyone and everyone, no matter who you are.
0553801473|4.0|One of the main reasons people will note is that this book took over 7 years to finally put togehter.  Whether it was  b/c GRRM is has the ending created and is trying to see how to create this book and ensure he ends this series in two more....is only a question the man himself can answer.  I will say this....overall this book was well worth the wait.<br /><br />  Like many of his other novels, many characters die (or may be dead, GRRM is good at making you wonder til the next book comes out) that you want to keep around while others stay alive when death is at their doorstep.  As many other reeviews have stated, the mind of GRRM is a baffling and confusing one, but his one saving grace is his ability to capture you in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire and keep you wanting more.  I wouldn't be surprised if after the end if GRRM decides to created prolouges like many other authors to depict what the world was like with dragons or how the other's were pushed back the first time.<br /><br />  If you enjoy Tolkein, Dennis L. McKeirnan, R.A. Salvatore........you are doing yourself an injustice by not picking up this series and reading it.  I have only heard about the HBO remake of the first novel but the accolades that have followed it thus far only prtray what many of us already know.....that this is a series that will stand throughout the annals of time as memorable on par with the great Tolkein.<br /><br />  For the record, this was one of the better books, but other characters that wer ehinted as still alive or bounding around in Westeros have not been mentioned for sometime but leave us wondering.....what is their role in noting that they still live.....will the other come.......will the Stormborn ever leash her dragons or will they consume her.....and will GRRM simply extinguish the growing flame of victory for the Targereyans or simply allow the Starks/Snow to be consumed in an endless winter?<br /><br />  George R.R. MArtin, like every other fan of yours is hoping, please finish while you still have that spark and imagination in you.  Robert Jordan is no longer with us so his Wheel of Time will never be truly finished by its creator.  Don't leave your current and future fans out.  I hope you enjoy this book and the overall series as much as I have.

0439023521|4.0|I literally couldn't put this book down. Since purchasing it yesterday afternoon, I have since finished both Hunger Games AND its Chasing Fire. Although it was an excellent, fast-paced, very intense read, I am feeling extremely needled by the glowing reputation of \\"originality\\" that Collins has gained for her development of the hunger games concept. I do not wish to offend any other readers, and (as I have stated) I did truly truly enjoy this book - read it in under 5 hours, in fact, when I should have been packing. However, I keep reading comments on Collins' originality in developing the CONCEPT of the games themselves. This is where I take issue: Any other readers out there who have seen the Japanese film \\"Battle Royale\\" would agree (I hope) that there are glaring similarities between the plot of that movie and that of the hunger games. I'll insert the Wikipedia link for any who are interested; it's an excellent movie with many themes identical to Collins' ( ...)). To sum up the plot of Battle Royale: Japanese schoolchildren are randomly selected by lottery to be dumped on a desert island. They are randomly given a selection of weapons (machete, gun, knife, pot, map, binoculars, etc), and then set loose. They must battle to the death until only one child survives. There are strong overtones of governmental abuse of power, fascism, as well as the \\"coincidental\\" similarity that this is done to punish a rebellious population. FURTHERMORE, the island is divided into quadrants, each of which is a danger zone during designated hours. This strikes far too close to Chasing Fire's game trick of dividing the arena into a clock with different dangers during different hours. I have an extremely strong feeling Collins might have derived quite a LOT of inspiration/material from this relatively unknown (in America) movie, which has way too many exactly-the-same devices to write off as mere coincidence. While I still think the book is compellingly written (I cried during a few of the more emotional points), I think it's really annoying that Collins hasn't ever been asked whether she's watched this movie (which came out many years ago). Furthermore, in the extremely likely event she was inspired by Battle Royale, I think it's pretty ridiculous she's been given all these compliments regarding her originality without giving credit where credit's due. I hope this doesn't discourage anyone from reading the book - it's one of the most interesting I've read in a while. This review was merely to - hopefully - open some readers' eyes to an equally compelling movie with a very similar plot.f the more emotional points), I think it's really annoying that Collins hasn't ever been asked whether she's watched this movie (which came out many years ago).

B005974CNA|3.0|Ok... Here we go.<br />I will skip all the crap and rap about who and what Dream Theater was and is now.<br />I own all the stuff they have ever put out there. CD/DVD you name it.<br />Been known to travel great spans of the earth to see them live.<br />Once I paid for 10 seats just to experience how it felt to share with a number of my close friends music that could be compared to a fine wine.<br />This latest release has me hoping history will repeat itself.<br />Once i bought an album ( Houses Of The Holy ) by Led Zepp.<br />I listened to it once and was so disappointed. I returned it at once for a refund.<br />Months later I was riding down this dirt road with some friends doing what young boys did back then on a dirt road after midnight.<br />The old eight track was reeling away in the in the background. Music was on that I could not quite identify. I remember thinking. Wow this is an awesome album. I must have it.<br />As I recall it. My reaction was nothing short of a jaw dropper. When I ask who it was. The drivers reply as you may have guessed was. (Houses Of The Holy )<br />I went back to the store the next day. I have worn out several copies of that album throughout the years.<br />Every kind of delivery system known to man. From 8 track to gold remasters. Ill never forget that vast oversight I had made.<br />Im finding myself today listening on a system that is nothing short of a concert hall 2 channel in your face 15,000 dollars worth of magnets, glass and miracles.<br />After one full rotation of this latest release. I prey for history to repeat itself.<br />I fear it will not. My former error was the lack of paying attention to detail.<br />This system makes details you can see and taste.<br /><br />They have lost the formula that has worked well.

B000W9MMPU|5.0|Movie reviews are what they are, an opinion on personal taste in movies.  I got this for my son, he loves the movies.  I ordered HD format for really cheap and was shocked to find it, blu-ray format showed up and I paid next to nothing comparatively --- no complaint from me.
0743201140|1.0|On page 79, you learn that to complete the StrengthFinder Profile (TM) you have to go online an enter an access code, which can only be used once per book. So, if an enthusiastic friend lent you the book, you cannot \\"discover your strengths.\\" You cannot even purchase an additional code separately from the book, which is offensive to me as being un-environmental and violating the bundle of property rights one expects to get when purchasing a printed copy of a book as opposed to a digital one. (Hello, Gallup Inc., lending is a crucial cultural practice associated with book reading.)    Moreover, the title of the book is misleading because the \\"themes\\" described after page 80 are actually what the authors label as \\"talents\\" earlier in the book. No where in the book do the authors describe how to develop your talents into strengths; they simple blithely say, \\"You will need to study your stongest themes of talent and figure out how they combine to create your strengths.\\" Thanks, that was helpful.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Not being a fan of Marvel Comics or of the endless transformations into cinema that these silly stories are seeing, THOR was not high on the list to view. Seeing it without the 3D variation that accompanied the theatrical release was a further detriment in deciding to watch it, but when a director of the caliber of Kenneth Branagh and a cast of both seasoned performers and exciting new faces pass the credit notification then it is tempting to give it a try. The surprise is that this is a very entertaining movie.  There is a lot of CGI business that probably in 3D was even more beautiful (the rainbow bridge, the ice realm etc), but even in regular vision the sets and designs are truly beautiful.  Some viewers might expect a version of the Viking gods adventure, but this is clearly a fairy tale version - tripping between the earth realm and the home of the gods, and that in and of itself make the film more enjoyable: it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously  and that is refreshing.<br /><br />Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules Asgard and has two sons - Thor (Chris Hemsworth, an Adonis with a very magnetic screen presence) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - by his devoted wife Frigga (Rene Russo).  Odin is about to pass his crown to Thor when the latter makes some wrong decisions and is cast out of the kingdom and lands in New Mexico where he encounters a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and weirdo friend Darcy (Kat Dennings). From Jane, Thor learns kindness, compassion and love and has become more the son that Odin desired.  Meanwhile back at home Loki is taking over (being the true son of King Laufey (Colm Feore) and as Odin lies dying Thor's buddies - Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Josh Dallas, a real find!), and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) with a bit of help from the gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) - descend to earth to aid Thor is becoming the quality of king he should be, etc etc<br /><br />In addition to the named cast there is a very very brief appearance by Jeremy Renner that just may be a signal that the followup THE AVENGERS will be around  soon.  The movie has a lot going for it, especially it the audience can sit back and enjoy the comic book atmosphere of this mixture of make believe and real life people.  It is surprisingly successful!

B003L77GGU|4.0|\\"Supernatural\\" was always meant to be five seasons long so when the show was renewed for two additional seasons the five year plan that creator Erick Kripke had in mind went out the window and so did Kirpke who although is still a consulting producer (and wrote the season finale for season six)stepped aside and writer/co-producer Sara Gamble took the reins.<br /><br />Although not as consistent as previous seasons \\"Supernatural\\" struggled to establish a consistent tone during the sixth season of the series. Nevertheless, the sixth season had a number of strong episodes including a couple of tongue-in-cheek classics written by writer/co-producer Ben Edlund (\\"The Tick\\").<br /><br />Introducing Sam and Dean's relatives as hunters was a great concept that wasn't developed as fully as it could have been; Sara Gamble and the other writers introduced a number of interesting characters including Sam and Dean's grandfather returning but didn't develop the characters as well as they could have. It's a pity because I think they could have built a couple of good episodes around the \\"hunter\\" family exploring their dynamic and relationship and eliminated a couple of the weaker episodes involving Sam & Dean's characters (or had them as peripheral characters much as they are in the episode \\"Weekend at Bobby's\\").<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />When we last saw Sam he descended to Hell with Luicifer's personna trapped inside him. Dean adopts a normal family life finding a peace he never had when he was raised. This lasts for a year but it seems like an eternity to Sam. When Sam mysteriously returns he lures Dean back into hunting but Dean finds Sam has changed--he's amoral and seems to delight in the torture of others something Sam would never do. Dean discovers that Sam has returned in body but he has no soul.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks positively stunning--with a sharp, desaturated presentation true to the look of the original broadcast. Audio is presented in HD 5.1 lossless quality.<br /><br />The extras include commentary tracks on Ben Edlund's amusing \\"Clap Your Hands If You Believe\\" and \\"The French Mistake\\" (by Edlund, producer Sara Gamble and director Robert Singer). The latter has an interactive trivia track for the Blu-ray.<br /><br />We also get a featurette on Jensen Ackles turn behind the camera for \\"Weekend at Bobby's\\"; the last two episodes for \\"Supernatural: The Animated Series\\" \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\" parts I and II are also include; we also get outtakes/alternate takes for \\"The French Mistake\\".<br /><br />The Blu-ray also includes \\"The Hunter's Guide\\" an interactive feature with exclusive featurettes on the production of the series buried within it. The special features are wrapped up with \\"Supernatural: The Quest for the Soul\\" a featurette on season six and the gag reel for the sixth season.<br /><br />While season six was a bit uneven taking awhile to find it's footing, once the sixth season did discover the tone for the season there were a number of outstanding episodes. Part of that issue was due to the switch over in producers but the main reason was that the show was originally designed as a five season series.<br /><br />Recommended.ented in HD 5.1 lossless quality.<br /><br />The extras include commentary tracks on Ben Edlund's amusing \\"Clap Your Hands If You Believe\\" and \\"The French Mistake\\" (by Edlund, producer Sara Gamble and director Robert Singer).

B004FEL6GO|3.0|This is a great toy and I would recommend it for any Transformer fan. Some parts are easy to pop off but you are able to put them back on.
B000002KE2|5.0|Originally to be titled \\"Snowblind\\" this is Sabbath's 4th effort and a bit different from the rest at the time. The album was retitled for fear of drug references. Most of Vol 4 has a dirge-like feel to it. Lots of slow, plodding metal riffs, possibly early stoner metal (?). The lyrics are a little different this time out. Previous, Sabbath warned us of the perils of war, drug abuse, Godlessness, polution, atomic war, and various other cheery subjects. This time out they take a completely anti-religious stance in \\"Under The Sun\\" and the \\"drug reference\\" in \\"Snowblind\\" is actually more subtle that say \\"Sweet Leaf\\" pro marijuana anthem. This is to say that if it weren't for the word \\"cocaine\\" being whispered at the end of the verse it would almost sound like an ode to photokeratitis or ultraviolet keratitis (a condition caused by by exposure to ultraviolet rays). That is if you're someone who actually pays attention to the lyrics. Most of the songs sound similar in form - starting out extremely slow then changing to double time in the middle and then returning to the original tempo. This tempo change at this time was another characteristic that set them apart from others. Another feature of Sabbath was the ability to build a song on just one or two chords for the most part and their use of drop tunings for even more bottom layer bone crusing riffs. This album to me always had a darker feel to it and a more \\"personal\\" feel to it as if it were coming from some introspective point of view.<br />Mostly slow death metal tunes except for \\"Supernaut\\" a heavy upbeat tune, \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" - strangely relaxing instrumental. The album's weak spots are for my money: \\"FX\\" (effects ?) electronic drums played through echo, and \\"Changes\\" is a maudlin piano ballad structured around two chords.<br />Fairly predictable as usual and pretty raw production, but by this time you probably already know whether you like Sabbath or not and this won't change your mind.
B00008YJH5|4.0|Raw and angular and aggressive, \\"Surfer Rosa\\" is dominated by its assaultive, abrasive guitar work, forceful, propulsive drumming, and a vacuum into which the moist, expansive quality of previous (and future) production work disappeared. Sure, the quiescent/aggressive dynamic that provided a blueprint for so many of their songs is present here, , but make no mistake- this album, one of the first half-dozen to be recorded by Steve Albini outside of his own band, Big Black, is meant to blister your eardrums even as you process the prominent hook(s) that each cut contains.     And if you thought that the lyrical content was both surreal and cryptic, holy and carnal, suggestive and at times nearing the profane on \\"Come On Pilgrim\\", then you'll be well-prepared for the lyrical juxtapositions on \\"Surfer Rosa\\". Just listen to \\"Bone Machine\\" , with its somewhat heavily rumbling bassline and martial, bottom-heavy thunderous drumming kicking the CD off, (\\"I was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss/he bought me a soda/he bought me a soda/he bought me a soda/and then he tried to molest me in the parking lot\\") or \\"Broken Face\\" (\\"There was a boy who had two children with his sisters/they were his daughters/ who were his favorite lovers), or \\"Cactus\\" (\\"Run outside in the desert heat/make your dress all wet and send it to me.\\"). Black Francis's vocal delivery has never before or since been as yowling, yelping, plaintive, and unrestrained, with Kim Deal's bratty, sensual voice serving as complimentary counterpoint on most of the tracks.  \\"Gigantic\\" is in a class all by itself- a paean to the massive length and girth of an interracial  hook-up's sexual organ, unleashing riffs that seem to channel roar-of-the-universe distortion as a coda after opening with an insistent, throbbing bassline, and sung in Kim Deal's most seductive purr. \\"Something Against You\\" and \\"River Euphrates\\" also unfold at a furious, aggressive pace, driven as much by the frenetic percussive flourishes of drummer David Lovering as they are by the discordantly tuneful abrasiveness of Joey Santiago's guitar riffing.     My review of \\"Surfer Rosa\\" is the 184th, and the only reason you might be encountering it is because as of the date of its posting, it's the most recent review. If you've read through the most helpful reviews you've probably already discovered what a seminal, influential release \\"Surfer Rosa\\" was. But don't get it to be trendy or fashionably alienated. Get it because even more than their spiritual predecessors Husker Du, the Pixies knew how to mine quirky, catchy hooks and a real sense of melodicism out of a quiescent/aggressive dynamic that marries discordancy with moments of truly profound beauty. You won't regret it!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I picked up this novel on a whim while searching for books I thought my middle school students would enjoy. The cover looked promising and the description intriguing. The photos throughout also added to mystique, so it was with great expectation that I began this story.    The story did not disappoint. While it was slow to start, it became increasingly more interesting as the plot unfolded. Once Jacob arrived at the island, the real entertainment began. The descriptions of everything from the Old Man to the bogs to the home itself (both of them) helped to create a complete mental image of the setting for the majority of the book. The characters may not have been developed deeply, but that didn't detract from the unique qualities they possessed. I loved that the novel uses challenging vocabulary (at least from the vantage point of teens) and incorporates visual interest with the photos to reinforce the characters and situations presented in the text.     I was disappointed with the abrupt ending that left way too much room for a sequel.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|Long-time, classic Dr. Who fan here. OK, I loved Eccleston and thought Tennant was pretty nifty -- I think Matt Smith is okay, too. But the writers and producers of this series have tripped up a bit trying to mainstream the Doctor's popularity IMHO. It's great that they've succeeded in getting younger fans into the show and it's mythology but at what cost? There was a treacly, \\"love conquers all\\" vibe throughout the Tennant-Piper eps, but this series takes the cake! As other reviewers have pointed out, Amy Pond is the main character here, the entire sixth season is all about her life, her loves -- all at the expense of the storyline (which snakes thru the entire season leading up to an incredibly complex climax with \\"The Big Band\\"). Ironically, Dr. Who the show has never looked better (reason enough to get ahold of the Blu-ray set) but the stories have suffered. Enough with the Deus-ex-machina endings! For the first time ever, The Doctor is now a heart-throb, now if only they can get the recipe right for the next season (haven't watched yet...no spoilers, please!), I'll be back for another helping.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I'm a long time Constant Reader, and I am afraid that Mr. King may be losing his fastball. \\"Under the Dome\\" is a better door stop than a read. The \\"Under the Weather\\" short story added to the \\"Fall Dark, No Stars\\" paperback edition was lame and predictable. And now, \\"Exit 81\\", a short story that purportedly is a return to old school SK - and in part, it is, because it revisits a number of earlier and better works, with a character even making a reference to a film version of one his novels. I found Exit 81 repetitious with one character after another showing up to suffer the same doom.  The ending is abrupt and silly, with characters that at one moment seems affected by the deaths perpetrated by the monster, and the next moment becoming cutesy. Ext 81 seems something SK typed out quickly, with no inner editor working in his mind asking if this is really good. One other thing bothers me - at the end of the story is a segment from 11/22/63, and I am afraid that \\"Exit 81\\" was perhaps a quick way to make a buck, and at the same time market the new Stephen King novel.He has done this type of marketing before with some of his paperback releases. But at least, you got something for your buck - a novel or a collection of stories. \\"Exit 81\\" is a throw away story that should have been filed in Stephen King's trunk, and simply not worth the $2.99.
6304698798|5.0|This is a classic. The best of Eastwood's spaghetti western trilogy. Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef all three shine in this epic (almost 3 hours long) saga about the search for missing gold coins. The adventure takes off from one place and leads to another. The story line is fairly simple and easy to follow with all three of the lead characters after the gold coins and making their way from here to there to do it. This is story consists of incidents that occur along the way to the final treasure. Lots of action and shootouts throughout - three hours worth as a matter of fact - from whiskey towns to the desert to rescue missions to Civil War POW camps we are taken on an adventure through a panoramic vision of the old west.<br />This is the pervect movie for a Saturday afternoon to curl up in the lazy boy with refreshments and just relax and enjoy. One of Eastwood's best overall and a fine western action/adventure movie to boot. Thumbs Up!
B000TSJU0E|5.0|This CD is one of my all-time favorites, but the grainy videos for \\"Legs\\" and \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" on the DVD are worth the price of the Collector's Edition.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I started this series (and finished it) this summer. I think 5 years or more waiting for a book to come out is ridiculous! What are we to read until the next part comes out? This book was good, there were a few parts that were wordy which is why I gave it four instead of five stars. I like how the last two books were split up and each book only references certain characters. It leaves you wondering what happened to the others...
0061537934|5.0|Great story especially for dog lovers, Enzo is awesome!  I made my husband read this and told him before hand he would laugh and cry through it and sure enough, he did.  Definitely my favorite book.
0765365278|5.0|It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a good epic fantasy. The operative word being \\"enjoyed.\\"      The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson may have been over 1,000 pages long, but it didn't read like it. He's one of my favorite authors - I've read Elantris 7 or 8 times by itself - and I'd been looking forward to this book for some time.      The main storyline revolves around the war sparked when the black-and-red-skinned Parshendi assassinated the Alethi King. Ten years after the war began, it has devolved into a competition between the Alethi princes for the gemstone hearts of the giant crustacean-like monsters who inhabit the battlefield. Only one of the princes, the Brightlord Dalinar Kholin, sees a problem with this, but his nightmarish visions of the end of the world have alienated him from his peers and made his judgment suspect.    The plot was incredible complex, mostly following the stories of several main characters: a former soldier turned slave, forced to labor under the infamous \\"bridge crews\\" who are essentially human shields to protect the real warriors from enemy arrows. A thief masquerading as a scholar to steal a priceless magical artifact and save her family. A paranoid young king who sees assassination plots in even his most trusted of advisors. An enslaved assassin with the ability to manipulate the forces of gravity who despises the murderous acts his masters force him to commit. A spren - largely unintelligent, fairy-like creatures attuned to very specific elements like pain, wind, or glory - who is becoming sentient as the human she is fixated with grows back his soul.    All the worldbuilding is detailed and very well done, but it does make for a somewhat slow start. So if you mean to dive into it, bring your patience.There was a good amount of repetition throughout the book; for example, I lost count of how many times Sanderson repeated that the Parshendi were not the same creatures as the enslaved parshmen, even though they looked exactly alike. I kept waiting for that to become relevant, but it didn't - at least in this book. There isn't much action for it being 1,000 pages long, and, as it is apparently the first novel in an anticipated 10-novel-long series, nothing is really wrapped up by the end. It's a thousand pages long, but at the end you feel like nothing's happened yet.      That being said, it was brilliantly written and engaging, I cared about all of the characters, and it read very quickly despite its length. I'm definitely going to read the next one even if it's 2,000 pages. The world itself was staggering in scope but not so unfamiliar that it alienated the reader; humans are humans and dogs are dogs, although most other life forms seem to be giant crustaceans (which is actually kinda cool; the last time I encountered any kind of giant crustacean was in Stephen King's The Drawing of the Three).  Each nation was well-crafted and explored, and each vastly different that the last.  One nation is plagued by 'Highstorms' so powerful that they whip building-sized boulders through the air likfe confetti and the plants themselves have learned how to move out of the way.  Another is filled with creatures who consider all forms of stone holy.    I could go on for a long, long time about this book.   But if you enjoy epic fantasy, you'll enjoy this.  I really liked it, and I'll probably read it again just before the next book comes out.
0738711500|5.0|I'm totally brand new to Tarot so I'm being as methodical as possible learning it.  I've read about 1/3 of the book so far and am doing everything just like it says to do.  I've started my dream journal and I'm up to the 5 of Wands in my card study.  I really like the way the author writes.  It's as if she's writing to me personally.  I'm taking her teachings seriously so I hope to someday become confident enough to actually do a reading for someone other than myself.  I appreciate how she stresses not to do readings for anyone and why until you've practiced on yourself for a long time.<br /><br />The cards are beautiful!  Large, full of meaning and each one is a work of art.  They are very easy to look at and are sturdy in construction.  If I take care of them they should easily last for years.  This is my first deck of tarot cards so I don't have any to compare them too but nonetheless, I'm happy with them.
B003QTSM4S|3.0|Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, and Amy Adams delivered the quality performances you've come to expect from them, and the bleakscape that is South Boston could not have been conveyed better; on the latter front, this was right up there with The Fighter and Mystic River (another Dennis Lehane adaptation).  That wasn't, however, enough to overcome the issues with this move, the main ones being that (a) the Patrick Kenzie/Angie Gennaro partnership became Patrick Kenzie (and Angie Gennaro), (b) Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan had no chemistry whatsoever and (b) Affleck not only doesn't have enough chops to carry this movie, but he was also severely miscast as Patrick Kenzie -- too young, too narrow a range, and a weirdly flat affect (frankly, it would have made more sense for Ben Affleck to play Kenzie and have someone else direct if he couldn't do both -- he's at least the right age and temperament, even if he's not the greatest actor the world has ever known).  It was still okay as a movie, so it gets three stars.  It would have gotten four if the male lead had at least been in the same ballpark as an excellent supporting cast, and five if the director had had a better grasp of what aspects of the novel, other than specific plot points, needed to be transferred to the screen.
B004X80QNG|3.0|This is almost as good as the Iphone app. I've had PI since 2003. I love this product but its missing icons and a Widget.  Apparently though, the Amazon app is missing the ability to sync with Google. I tried the Android Market version and you can with that one. Until you can sync with Google and get a Widget, it gets three stars.
B005974CDU|3.0|I have been waiting with great anticipation for this CD, and to ME, it falls short.  I feel it was poorly produced for starters.  Secondly, am I the only person who thinks they are going a \\"tad\\" to goth on this one....certain tracks are trying to be far more epic sounding, which is not particularly suited to my tasted.  WIth that said, of course I miss Mike as well.    Again, not a horrible CD by any means, but it just didnt stack up to my expectations.  I suppose if any other band had made this cd, I probably would have given it 4 stars, but i have very high expectations for these guys.

B005COO1X6|2.0|Another King mashup.      'IT' + 'Buick 8' = 'Mile 81'    You know, just like 'IT' + 'Tommyknockers' = 'Dreamcatcher'    I'm a huge SK fan, but I'd skip it if I were you.    Although he did start building suspense in this short story as if it was going somewhere and got in the neighborhood of a climax, it seems like someone spliced in ending.  Was it really a climax?  Or was he just faking it?    Wait a minute.  What just happened here?  In a flash of brilliance an ancillary character comes out of nowhere and defeats the bad guy.  The End.    After extensive research and countless interviews with imaginary people, I believe I have accurately captured the details surrounding this travesty of a short story in the following dramatization.    ---  SK (talking to self): \\"Yes, yes, that's it.  We're winding it all into a big messy ball of complicated and seemingly unrelated relationships.  Moohoo-ha-ha!\\"    Phone Rings with cash register ringer:  \\"CHA-CHING...CHA-CHING...\\"    SK (picks up phone):  \\"Hey, is this Johnny Paycheck?  Have I ever told you that you're my favorite agent?\\"    JP:  \\"Every time I send you a check, Steve-o!  How's that short story coming along?\\"     SK:  \\"Great!  We're in the thick of it now, and we're ready for the poor suckers to start figuring out how bad the situation is and start developing their crisis-based relationships.  I'm really excited about this one, Johnny.\\"    JP:  \\"Sounds really good, Steve-o.  Oh, the publisher has offered you another bonus if you can turn over the story tomorrow.  How likely is that?\\"    SK:  \\"I can answer that question in two syllables, Johnny.  CHA-CHING!\\"    Both laugh.  SK types \\"The End\\" and emails the story to the publisher    ---    And this concludes today's episode of Steve-o Theater.  Please join us next time when we'll be reviewing '11/22/63: A Novel' and hoping it is not 'IT' + 'Somewhere in Time'
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I bought this the other day and have watched it twice already, with the intention of watching it again this week!  I love musical theatre, but for whatever reasons, I have always missed this when it came to my town (it's coming again this spring and I am definitely going!!).  I know there are a lot of Les Mis experts out there, but in my own humble opinion, the performances, the songs, the whole experience was what made me buy it after actually renting it.  I needed to see it again.  I was in tears at the end.  Beautiful rendition, and I do have to admit that I laughed myself when I heard Nick Jonas was cast, but I (and this, again, is just me), thought he did a fine job.  I liked him a lot in this, along with favorites Ramin Karimloo and Lea Salonga.  If you are a Les Mis fan, this is a definite must have.

B00005MP58|5.0|Many people rave about how great 2005's Pride & Prejudice was. That adaptation does not hold a candle to this one, which came about ten years before it. This five-hourish film explores Austen's novel beautifully, so much so that you begin to believe that there can only be one Mr. Darcy: Colin Firth, and likewise with Jennifer Ehl's Elizabeth Bennet. Because this film is so long and detailed, the characters are given time to develop, to make you care about them. The scenery is beautiful, the script is very close to the novel, the acting is magnificent...there is really nothing lacking in this beautiful, amazing film.

Yes, that's exactly what happened. The reason being, that there's a few things they could have done better. For starters, why is Liam Neeson barely even in the movie??? He's a big name actor now, isn't he??? Though I admit I didn't like this movie as much as the original, I still think it's a good enough movie to have in my collection. Also, this is not a ripoff of the game God Of War!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I downloaded this to have the \\"real\\" Kindle edition on my Kindle, though I had already downloaded Gutenberg's free version. (The Gutenberg version has a nice linked Table of Contents at the beginning that clicking \\"menu\\" and then \\"go to\\" and \\"table of contents\\" brings you to -- I'd rather have the easily accessible ToC. To get to the ToC for the Amazon download, you have to page back from the first story or page forward from the cover. It's odd that \\"go to\\" does not work for the official Kindle version but does for the Gutenberg mobi download.)  However, whichever ebook version you download, you will get the same set of twelve Sherlock Holmes stories, the beginning of Conan Doyle's series of Holmes short stories. (ETA: The first novel was \\"A Study in Scarlet.\\") The first story, \\"A Scandal in Bohemia,\\" features Irene Adler, the famous woman who captured Holmes's interest and imagination, if not, perhaps, his heart! The second story in the collection, \\"The Red-Headed League,\\" is one of my favorites for its humor and sense of the bizarre. We also learn in this story of a master criminal at work.  Another of my favorites is \\"The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb,\\" which includes a dash of gothic horror to it, and read late at night with only my Kindle reading light on, it had distinctly creepy overtones.  It's a great addition to your Kindle library if you like classic mysteries. I think I'll stick with the Gutenberg download, however, since it does have the clickable table of contents -- and \\"go to\\" will bring you right to it.   **EDIT**Some other reviewers have mentioned problems with special characters in the Amazon version (the pound sterling symbol, accented characters, and such). The Gutenberg mobi version does not have these typos -- they have a proofreading system that would eliminate any distorted text if they were to occur. I have read almost all of the stories in the Gutenberg mobi version, and the symbols all appear correctly in the text.rectly in the text.

0792844890|5.0|I'm sorry, but I cannot quite think of a headline as funny as this movie. This is a spoof of every good science fiction film ever made...what else needs to be said??? Okay fine, This is a good quality disc, but not perfect. There are a whole lot of worthy special features. This is an underrated Mel Brooks movie. And what's all that churning and bubbling, you call that a radar screen??? No sir, we call it...Mr. Review.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had no idea I would love this book as much as I do... all 3 books in the series are amazing.  I was transformed into her world and it was a nail biter to the end.  I don't normally reread books, but I will be rereading this quite a few times.  It is a very thought provoking story line.  It has made me see the world a little differently and I am thankful for all I have.<br /><br />This is a great series and well worth the read!
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|If I never saw Band of brothers, I probably would have given this 4 stars instead of 3.    But, I did see Band of Brothers first, and I guess my expectations were high as a result.   Some of the action scenes were excellent but, I thought it was a little slow (sometimes for entire episodes.     I also thought that the timeline was a bit inconsistent in that some battles were over covered while others were merely glossed over.   I also though the love/drama/action ratio shifted more toward the love/drama than existed in the Band of Brothers, so perhaps thats why I thought it was a bit slower moving than it should be.         If you have NOT seen Band of Brothers, I highly recommend buying that series instead of this one.    Tom Hanks was co-producer in both series.    I almost feel guilty giving this a lower rating than perhaps it deserves if you were to compare it to most other series like this.    But, I think that many people that are likely to purchase this are doing so because they have seen Band of Brothers and they expect more of the same.
B0031RSA24|4.0|Richard Dawkins describes all the evils caused by religions, especially when they turn to fanaticism. His book could be an eye opener for many people helping them to free themselves from bad influences.<br />Honest atheists are mostly more intelligent than blind followers of religions. They will be able to live their lives in their own responsibility without any guidance. But most people want to be \\"followers\\" in order to get advice for their daily life and that is mostly given by religions bearing the risk to follow dangerous leaders. Alternatives are not really in sight.<br />Richard Dawkins follows in his argumentations strictly the dogma of \\"materialism\\" being a dogma and the working base of sciences. This leads of course to pure atheism as ultimate goal.<br />Only if we can free ourselves from any dogma including materialism we can develop an alternative rational world view as I have described in: [[ASIN:B00540PH8Q A Rational Philosophy of Life]]<br />Then the question is no longer whether God exists, but whether there is a spiritual world beside the material one and whether we will still exist as conscious and active individuals after our biological death.
0307887898|5.0|Eric Ries has finally published his manifesto on The Lean Startup. It is one of, perhaps the, most important business books published this year. The Lean Startup is a concept that Eric as well as many others have been promoting for many years and it arrises from years (and in fact decades) of related work, it isn't a complete new set of concepts and no this isn't \\"how to build a startup on as little money as possible\\" nor is it \\"how to build a startup in a recession\\". Lean does not mean \\"on the cheap\\" - the Lean Startup is about efficiency, about reducing waste, about building something that creates value - proven value and getting exceptionally good at all of the core drivers of your business.<br /><br />I read a review copy given to me by Eric at one of his conferences. I've known Eric for many years, long before his blog and speaking career took off, we would meet in downtown Palo Alto at IMVU's offices and discuss what he was learning about how to build a great startup. A few years ago he left IMVU and his blog and speaking career took off. I mention this because I consider Eric both a friend and mentor. His thinking about startups has deeply influenced my own startup career both as an entrepreneur myself and as an advisor and consultant to other companies and organizations.<br /><br />So disclosures out of the way, here is my short review (again of the preview copy, I will update this after my copy arrives and I've reread it).<br /><br />Who is The Lean Startup for?  Not just for entrepreneurs here in San Francisco, the Lean Startup principles apply equally to startup projects inside of large organizations. It is a process to help form hypotheses, test them and iterate, to make the uncertain more certain and to avoid wasting resources, especially time.<br /><br />What will you learn from this book? Besides \\"a lot\\" (which you will) You will learn how to start testing your hypotheses about your business, a number of approaches drawn from real case studies on howto use what Eric calls a \\"minimum viable product\\" to test quickly and efficiently and how this, in turn, prepares you to leverage resources and scale rapidly (yet efficiently). The Lean Startup is, however, about a process it isn't a simple (or quick fix) but it will cause you to rethink how you grow your business (whatever size of organization you work for or own).<br /><br />I know that in months to come I'll be recommending The Lean Startup to countless people.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all 3 books in 3 days... I just could not stop until I knew what happened.

I have recommended all three books to my friends...  My husband is even excited to read them and he never reads a book.

B001VNB54A|5.0|i would give this about a 9/10 great series, but it isn't as good as band of brothers so my suggestion would be get band of brothers and when you absolutely love that, then come and buy this, for this is a really graphic series including some male nudity and male butts, a few sex scenes, a few nudity scenes with females.  although this is more graphic it truly shows what people went through over in the pacific. my favorite parts are 2 and 5.  I truly hope you buy this, because if you have anyone thinking of joining the military blindly this shows how truly devastating of an impact war has on the mind and how people go insane in war.

B004LWZW4C|1.0|I'm sure it's a very nice movie but that doesn't mean much if you can't watch it, does it? Maybe a future update will fix the problem but the last one looks like it was in May so it's hard to be optimistic this will be resolved any time soon.     I do have to say \\"Not being sure if the movie will even bleeping play\\" doesn't exactly inspire confidence in buying stuff. As is I know I'm certainly not getting any other recent 20th Century Fox titles until this is fixed.
B0026P40NU|2.0|Ok, I know this is a 'fictionalized' account, but this cynical, mocking, shallow account is an insult to preRaphaelites.  It tries to 'frame' them as partying rock stars, or in the case of Hunt, as a dumb hypocrite (yes he had his passions, but beliefs were serious to him). In watching this series you get no clue into their intellectual insights, into their vision and drive. You'd have no clue why they were friends in the first place only that they're all out to lie backstab and cheat each other... Occasionally the writer sticks in some banter about 'new ideas' but we never find out how or why.   You would never know that these guys could quote Dante and Keats at length, how hard they worked, or that, for example, Hunt had deep sincere religious convictions that drove his work. Sorry these guys were not superficial 'rock stars' who appealed to shallow 16 year olds (which describes much of the baby boom generation, even at 60).  Really this boilerplate soap/bodice ripper script could may as well be about a group of young, not so smart bankers or journalists or Postal workers for that matter. They have no gravitas. But what it really is, is a reflection of what the media elite think lies behind human nature-  even with artists that gave us works like PRB, and that is a sad reflection of them, not the PRB artists, and knowing that, its not hard to figure out why the UK is in the state it's in.  The acting and screenplay are awful. Dante seems to do nothing but bed women, kiss his men on the forehead when they do something he likes, and say things like \\"That's such a Fred thing to do\\" - does this sound like 19th century dialogue or a \\"Friends\\" Sitcom?   Other commentators have pointed out the historical inaccuracies, I agree and will add to my displeasure of depicting Morris and Burnes Jones as comic nit-wit duo.  The inaccuracies are not mere trivia - the series misses the whole essence of the PRB.  Some other reviewers also noticed the absence of Chritinia Rossetti...all I can say is, thank goodness! Goodness knows what the writers would have portrayed her.   On the upside It's beautifully shot, Zoe Tapper is great as Ruskin's wife, she is one of the few characters who actually seems 'Victorian' and not an MTV video jockey in costume.  Overall, I would say its worth watching if only for the visual appeal and occasional chuckle.       I love the work of the Pre-raphaelites, i hope to see a better depiction soon!
0394873742|4.0|This book is a game, a play toy, a great book to read and re-read. It's a common book for the children to select at story-time. Richard Scarry's Biggest Word book Ever has many wonderful features in addition to being a very good story time book.<br />I've seen children play with this book day after day. Two or three children can play with this book at the same time. The Cardboard pages are tough, able to stand up to many years of play. My first copy of this wonderful book lasted 9 years before I replaced it with another copy.<br />The bright colors and creative drawings are very attractive and children really like Richard Scarry's details.<br />The children will often lay this book down and pretend to \\"be in the book\\" with their small cars and toys driving the cars all over the pages. They adore playing with their vehicles and pretend people on the pages. Sometimes Children will use the big size of this book to make forts or house walls. One little boy would always lay down on the book at nap time. He would run to get this book to place his nap mat over the book. Perhaps it helped him dream.

B0052VUNHC|3.0|Abby Abernathy and her best friend, America, have left their troubles behind in Kansas. They're enjoying their new student stint at Eastern University, and for Abby especially, she loves the anonymity of the college town.<br /><br />America also loves Eastern, but that could have something to do with her wonderful boyfriend, Shepley. America starts spending more and more time with `Shep', at the apartment he shares with his cousin, Travis `Mad Dog' Maddox.<br /><br />Abby has heard of Travis. He has a reputation. Not only is he famous for his fists - participating in illegal campus fighting rings, he also has a reputation as a ladies man. He's a love em' and leave em' type, and has been with most of the Eastern female co-eds. And when Abby is introduced to Travis for the first time (after he sprays her cardigan with blood) she is unimpressed by his come-on's. But Travis won't give up on the one girl who doesn't want him...<br /><br />`Beautiful Disaster' is a contemporary romance from self-published author, Jamie McGuire<br /><br />I admit; the front cover was what first intrigued me. It's not a great cover - but it certainly makes you look closer and go, `huh?' Then I became curious about the great 4.35 rating on Goodreads, and the many book bloggers who began raving about this little sleeper hit.<br /><br />`Beautiful Disaster' is, in many ways, your typical `good girl falls for the bad boy' storyline. Travis is the campus man-whore, and as Abby is friends with his cousin she is more than aware and cautious of his reputation. Still, despite giving him cold-shoulder and clear `not gonna happen' warnings, Travis can't stay away. He's intrigued by Abby, and desperate for her friendship if nothing else. When Abby loses a bet to him, she is coaxed into living at his apartment and becoming reluctant roomie to Shepley and America too. For a little while Abby and Travis make great bedfellows - he treats her with the respect and kindness he doesn't show to his couch-conquests, and Abby is privileged to see a different side to Travis Maddox, which is a far departure from his `Mad Dog' reputation.<br /><br />But when another guy takes an interest in Abby, Travis's territoriality breaks out. He can't deny what he's wanted from the start, and the two of them enter into a relationship that everyone knows is going to be a beautiful disaster.<br /><br />I have to admit, I didn't really know where Jamie McGuire was going with this book - and that was both a good and bad thing. In the beginning I thought this would follow a tried and true `good girl befriends the bad boy, falls for a goody-goody prep boy until she realizes she liked the bad stuff all along' type of plot. But McGuire pulled the rug out from under me when she had Abby and Travis coming to their senses fairly early on in the plot, and embarking on a relationship (the first monogamous one for Travis).<br /><br />Then I thought the book was going for a sinister bent ... when Abby acknowledges her feelings for Travis, he gets very, very scary (at least, to me he did). He becomes &uuml;ber-Alpha and territorial. The kind of guy who keeps his arm draped across his girlfriend's shoulders in a semi-headlock, just to warn other guys off. The `pissing on a hydrant' of body language. Furthermore, Travis is quick to violence. He has been making easy money off prep boys betting on him in the ring - but when he and Abby start dating he unleashes that violence on any guy who so much as looks at her lustily.<br /><br />It was disturbing, to say the least. But I also thought it was kind of ingenious - because for the first half of the book, McGuire does endear Travis to us. Girls like a bad boy, and Travis clearly has some residual wounds that he articulates with sex and violence. I, like Abby, was falling for him... up until the moment when they decide to start a relationship, and he goes scary-territorial. I thought surely McGuire was writing a slow creep of abuse, and I was waiting for the moment when Travis stopped accusing other guys of wanting his girlfriend, and started assuming Abby was asking for it.<br /><br />Except, it doesn't happen. McGuire pulls out a last minute plot switch-up about Abby's dark family past and an impromptu trip to Vegas has her seeing Travis is an unflattering light. That's what drives a wedge between them - not his hella scary hair-trigger anger or suffocating love.<br /><br />I really, really liked the first half of this book. Abby and Travis were a very different `bad boy/good girl' couple, and McGuire did interesting things with twisting their romantic plot. But things became a little skewed for me when Abby seemed numb to Travis's claustrophobic affection.<br /><br />I actually think there is a lot of room for a sequel to this story, and that could possibly explore those issues I found lacking in `Beautiful Disaster'. There's no question that McGuire is a fantastic storyteller and interesting new voice in contemporary romance - but I wish there had been more realistic questioning of this bad boy's behavior, instead of glossing it over as `forever love'.<br /><br />3.5/5started assuming Abby was asking for it.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|Anthrax's long awaited release \\"Worship Music\\" finally sees the light of day after one of the most troubled gestation periods of a modern release this side of Guns 'n' Roses' \\"Chinese Democracy\\". As is well known metal folklore by this point & time, this album was originally set to be released on October 23rd , 2009 with vocalist Dan Nelson. However, he was fired not too long before that date and the band then shelved the release of the completed album as a result. Flash forward to September 13th 2011 and the partially reworked album is released but with vocalist Joey Belladonna (who replaced original vocalist Neil Turbin in 1985 after Neil was fired in 1984) on vocals which is his first Anthrax album since 1990's \\"Persistance of Time\\".  Belladonna was sacked in 1992 to be replaced by Armored Saint's John Bush who would be with the band through 2004 and would also rejoin from 2009-2010 before quitting again to replaced by Belladonna. Joey had rejoined in 2005 for a reunion tour that lasted through 2007 only to be canned again in eventual favor of Dan Nelson in 200. Trust me that as a lifelong Anthrax fan, trying to explain briefly Anthrax's singer trials & tribulations can be a daunting task!<br /><br />But now that the new album is finally out, we can discuss Anthrax again in regards to their music instead of this seemingly neverending vocalist soap opera. While I prefer the band's output with Belladonna from 1985-1990 which most people consider the band's creative golden age while also commercially very successful too, they did also release some great stuff with Bush too. In particular, I felt that the 1st and last John Bush albums \\"Sound of White Noise\\" and \\"We've Come for You All\\" rank among some of Anthrax's finest efforts alongside classic Belladonna stuff like \\"Among the Living\\", \\"Spreading the Disease\\" and \\"Persistence of Time\\". But it does bring a smile to this long time fan's face to hear Belladonna in such fine form again singing over top such a fantastic collection of music. This new album easily ranks as one of their best and something that all metal fans young and old owe it to  themselves to give a listen.<br /><br />This album had so much baggage associated with it that the band quite simply had to deliver a knockout punch of an album to silence all naysayers and I feel that they did in spades. Belladonna delivers an awesome vocal performance throughout and fits the music like a glove. I even think that Bush supporters are bound to like what Belladonna pulls off here. The band itself sounds on fire too with a sense of purpose and vitality that shows most modern metal acts how the old guard can still do it better and why Anthrax are metal legends. I was highly skeptical but color me extremely impressed. Old school thrash forever!tion of music.

B004SHED22|1.0|Look at the cover- the horrible photoshop job of the kids running across the pavement is foreshadowing of what is inside. If the cover isn't believable, how can the story? I believe that Dorothy skipped down the yellow brick road, but those kids are lifted probably from a greeting card or calendar and dropped on the Parisian street. I need not review further, just read the above one-star reviews, they say what I need not repeat here. I especially cannot tolerate the dumbed-down short choppy sentences- read the first sentence of Anne of Green Gables (read when I was eight)- it is a page and a half long! Reading Sarah's Key is like trying to read a book while being driven in a  car over a bumpy dirt road. And, storywise,  what parent would lock their kid up in a cupboard, and then go placidly onto a train to go for how long no one knows? Stupid,stupid,stupid! i beg you , please go and read a real book, like The Diary of Anne Frank, Anne of Green Gables, The Incredible Journey, Never Cry WOlf, My Side of the Mountain, Soul Sister, Joy in the Morning and the best book ever written for young adults but everyone will love it, A Lantern in Her Hand by Aldrich. NOT THAT IS A BOOK!!!!!
B005DC68NI|5.0|I've read a couple of David's short stories and loved them! I knew he was a great writer but I wasn't sure if that would spill over into a `how to' book... of course it did!! Awesome job! The way he talks you through every aspect of self-publishing (plus all the why and why not's) is great! It makes you excited to try and interested in learning how! It's very conversational... not preachy! He gives you both sides of the story, which I like a lot. In part one, he's very detailed in his explanation of how the numbers break down, or could break down and helps you understand this eBook world we're now in. Part two, he tells you step by step how and why you need to do certain things while writing, editing, designing a cover, formatting or blogging and then how and where to look for help in these areas. In part three there are a number of success stories!! Plus several appendixes with resources and other great practical info like copyrights, short stories, going International and more. As others have said, some of this information can be found in pieces around the web, but to have it all in one place and so easy to access and read is perfect!

B005974CDU|5.0|I got into Dream Theater around early 1993 when a friend at the time gave me his copy of their 1992 CD Images and Words for free as he stated to me at the time that \\"there are too many keyboards on it\\". I was at the time in a huge progressive rock phase and I immediately became a Dream Theater fan. I also loved everything that they subsequently released up through and including 1999's Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory. But starting with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence I felt that the wheels really began to fall off in a big way. With the exception of Octavarium, things just kept getting worse and even more contrived to where I had pretty much thrown in the towel as a fan after Black Clouds & Silver Linings. They just sounded tired collectively and in a massive rut that I felt by that point that they were incapable of escaping.<br /><br />But when all of the Mike Portnoy drama went down and the remaining 4 members stated that not only would they be continuing on with a new album & a new drummer in Mike Mangini (I've been a huge fan of his for years), my interest in the band was restored somewhat. Would they be able pull it off? Was Portnoy's creative control over his band the reason they had grown so stagnant over the last decade?<br /><br />What I can truly say is that their new release A Dramatic Turn of Events is a triumphant return to form for the progressive metal veterans. They sound re-energized and the songs themselves have a sense of control, craftmanship and quality that harkens back to their glory days while still sounding fresh and moving the band forward. James Labrie's vocals haven't sounded this great in eons. Jordan Rudess's keyboards & John Petrucci's guitar find a level of taste and when called for restraint that ranks among their best to date. John Myung's marvelous bass work is higher in the mix and stellar as always while Mike Mangini's drum work is fluid and oh so tasteful. The instrumental passages actually have a point in the context of the songs once again instead of endless noodling and the production & mix is crystal clear. The album thankfully wasn't over compressed in the mastering process like way too many modern CD's are which allows the dynamics to soar.<br /><br />If you were like me and had written Dream Theater off, give this great new release a listen and I almost guarantee that you'll be pleasantly surprised. My faith as a fan has been restored and this new release ranks easily as one of their best. Whatever your opinion or stance on the messy departure of founding drummer Mike Portnoy was, give this new album a proper chance with an open mind, you won't regret it!l passages actually have a point in the context of the songs once again instead of endless noodling and the production & mix is crystal clear.

0439023491|4.0|Suzanne Collin's plot line and setting are very engaging and will hold you to the last page (and to the next book). Despite this, her writing style is a little slack, lacking the enveloping detail of other writers. I'm very glad for purchasing them and I will read them again and again, but they don't quite hit the spot when it comes to imagery.
B002M3SP28|1.0|I love Jeffrey Archer and have enjoyed all of his other works.  This reads like it was written by a novice.  I'm on page 65 and I'm giving up.  I'm just not pulled in like I usually am with his writing.
B005E7AOHI|3.0|I've been a huge Primus fan since late 1991 when I was given their classic release from that year \\"Sailing the Seas of Cheese\\" as a Christmas gift from a co-worker where I worked at that time while a junior in high school. As a long time bass player, I was instantly hooked on Les Claypool's highly original and influential bass playing that really made me re-evaluate what the bassist's role in a band could be. In addition to making the jump from a 4 to 6 string bass,I promptly picked up 1990's \\"Suck on This\\" and \\"Frizzle Fry\\" and was instantly hooked. I also loved their 1992 covers E.P. \\"Miscellaneous Debis\\" along with 1993's \\"Pork Soda\\" and 1995's \\"Tales from the Punchbowl\\". Punchbowl would be the last release until 2003 to feature amazing drummer Tim \\"Herb\\" Alexander who would quit the band after the tour for the tour.<br /><br />I was much less enamored with their 1997 album \\"Brown Album\\", 1998's covers release \\"Rhinoplasty\\" and 1999's \\"AntiPop\\" that all featured drummer Brian \\"Brain\\" Mantia as they just didn't have the magic quality that their output with Herb behind the kit had. I was thrilled when Primus after a 4 years hiatus reunited with Herb on the 2003 five song E.P. \\"Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People\\" and saw them twice on that subsequent tour. And then there was no more new Primus material of any sort until 9/13/11. During that period Les would release increasingly hit/miss solo efforts & side projects while Primus would only release a single disc career retrospective in 2006 called \\"They Can't all Be Zingers\\" that didn't feature any new songs.<br /><br />So, with all that historical perspective as a long term Primus fan, their new release \\"Green Naugohyde\\" featuring drummer Jay Lane (who was actually in Primus during the late 80's) isn't nearly as good as an overall release that it could & should have been. Nor is the new release a complete disaster as I thought that it could have been based on how terrible I felt that Les' last 2 solo albums in particular came across to me. It's a truly frustrating release that features moments of true brilliance that advance the Primus sound into new creative waters while also featuring generally half baked ideas. The lackluster don't really sound like songs are indicative of the type of stuff that Les had been churning out on his own for a while prior to this. They come across like he just whipped up a riff, repeated it over and over right at that moment and just mumbled stuff over top while calling it a song.<br /><br />The biggest surprise for me on the new CD was drummer Jay Layne's performance. He turns in a very inspired performance that strikes a nice balance between Herb's over the top drum theatrics and Brain's more groove and simplified orienated playing. Les's bass playing is great as always though his vocals continue to go down hill. He used to have his vocals mixed high up on their classic releases but over time, I can now barely tell what the hell he's saying on the newer stuff. He was never the best singer, but at least then he didn't just sort of talk incomprehensibly throughout all of the tracks like on the new album. Guitarist Larry Lalonde turns in a fine performance and actually writes all of the music on 2 tracks all by himself. He's always been one of my favorite guitarists and doesn't disappoint here.<br /><br />The front half of the CD has a lot of the filler and the 2nd half of the album is much stronger. It is yet to be seen if this CD will grow on me anymore and if it does, I'll update my review accordingly at that time with additional thoughts. But Primus really needed to knock this one out the park and as a whole, they weren't able to do it. There are great moments here and there but as a whole, the entire release sounds half baked and rushed more often than not.<br /><br />Hopefully this was just them shaking off the recording cobwebs and the next release will be much more focused and accomplished. Until then, Primus still sucks! :)e across to me.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|great game like always but seriously, it lags like crazy between every level and not tablet optimized... that's prety lame. we all know you can do better than this, popcap! please improve with an update! is that too much to ask for? you made it HD and perfect without lags for apple... why can't you do the same for android? stop neglecting android users!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Something in a magazine that I saw made me order this cd. Did not kone anything about the man except that is from England and he plays Dr. House. I have been in love with this cd from first play. It´s bluse with lot´s of feeling. It´s slow it´s fast and the sound of the cd is super super good. It is an album I have been hopeing Dr. John would make but there are some strong similaritys here. Of all the cd´s that I have got so far this year this is the one that askes for most replays.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|..until I can have the original theatrical releases. I cant stand Boba fett's new voice. its too much. Just remaster the originals please. no alterations.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I knew the album was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be this great. I've been a Joey Belladonna fan since the mid 80's.  When he left, I quit listening to them. I just couldn't hear Anthrax as the same band. I still like the classics like Spreading the Disease and Among the Living, but this album dominates them all. My ears could be deceiving me, but I swear I hear some Metallica influences in there too. All the songs are great but the song Judas Priest is by far the best song!!!!
1401324517|5.0|The narrative goes back and forth between first and third person - the author has done a solid job of capturing Rafa's voice in the first person segments.  The third person chapters are beautifully written, reminiscent of Jon Wertheim's \\"Strokes of Genius.\\"<br /><br />The first chapter focuses on Nadal's thoughts leading up to the first ball strike of the 2008 Wimbledon final against Federer.  Those who have read Wertheim's book on this match may brace themselves for a disappointing rehash of that historic match - if this might be you, relax and know that there are plenty of new and enjoyable insights into Rafa's world.<br /><br />I enjoyed getting to know Rafa off the court, especially his thoughts on those closest to him.  I was quite intrigued by his thoughts on his Uncle Toni, an iconic figure in the sport.  The Uncle Toni that we see through Rafa's eyes is quite different from the image that mainstream tennis media has created over the years.<br /><br />Fans, players, and tennis parents will find lots to consider in learning about Rafa's approach to the game and his life.<br /><br />Well worth your time.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|The accessory attaches easily to the Peg Perego Si stroller.  It holds fountain drinks without spilling.  Very convenient for keys, etc.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I want the theatricals, I wont be fobbed off. I't not hard really, blade runner has FIVE versions of the film! Close encounters has 3. this is star wars.
0553582038|5.0|This book was amazing in the continuing saga of the Iron throne. It told a great story of the characters of Kings Landing. Well written and on the edge of your seat. George Martin is an excellent writer and I cannot wait to get the next book in the series.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I really liked this book.  I'd give it a 3.5.  Maybe because in the late 70's and early 80's I was a geek who played D&D and listened to Rush and spent all my extra money at the arcade.  If any one of those things sounds familiar, you will like this book, too.  I could have lived without the \\"romance\\" portion, but it didn't detract that much from the overall fast-pace and entertainment level of the story.  There were many laugh out loud moments for me, as I relived parts of games I barely remembered, and learned a lot about the secrets in games I never got good enough at to actually beat. The writing wasn't fantastic, but it got the job done. Neal Stephenson it's not.    If you've ever looked at 4 quarters in the palm of your hand and thought, \\"I'm good for the afternoon\\" then you'll probably love this.      If you've ever bragged about playing pac-man for 4 hours on a single quarter (because *that* will reel in the babes for sure) then you will probably love this.      Even if you've never rolled a 20 sided die, you will probably still enjoy it.  But it's better if you know the lyrics to 2112 and have been eaten by a Grue.  Just sayin'.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Its been forever! Soon please? It won't open the locked level .....I'm waiting! I love the game but always mute the sound b/c it's pretty annoying.
030726999X|5.0|This was a great 3rd book in the series.  Just wish there were more to come!!  What a shame there won't be!
B0054N73EY|3.0|Overall, the album disappointed me a little.  I waited for it and bought it the first day it was released.  I should have been warned when I heard Adventures of Raindance Maggie on the radio and thought, \\"oh...RHCP messed that one up.\\"  Now that I've listened to the album for about 3 weeks, I'm ready to buy a different band.    Don't get me wrong - the songs are pretty good, and the musicianship is unparalleled.  My main criticism is that the album is kind of poppy and is lacking the soul and grit of their previous albums.  The melodies/lyrics are kind of happy and shallow - not near as pensive or passionate as Californication, By the Way, or Stadium Arcadium.    It's true that this album is \\"a new sound\\" for RHCP, but I guess I was hoping that it would be \\"new\\" in a sense that they'd go back to the 80's.  If you're in hoping for the RHCP that you have grown to love over the past 10-15 years, sample the album before you buy.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These stickers are amazing! They were delivered right on time and they look so cute in my bathroom :) Besides the fact that they're vibrant and gorgeous, the material they were put on was really sturdy and they didn't even come close to ripping when I was pulling them off of the paper (I was not being very gentle). Also, the stick stayed on them when I was removing and replacing them. I pulled sleeping beauty off 4 times and she stuck just as good every time. Lastly, theres no air bubbles! Same review goes for all the little jewels that it comes with. Each princess is about 10x7 inches.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I love the new record. I don't think it's better than Need You Now but it's very good and worth every penny.  Stand out track for me is \\"Dancin Away with My Heart\\". This is a smash crossover hit waiting to happen. The lyrics are so good and really take you back to that time in your life when you had that dance with someone special.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|*Update* I just got a [[ASIN:B002WRI4HU Fulton Espresso Corner Media Stand]] last night, assembled it, and decided to try moving my Kinect to the edge of it with the Zoom attached to see if it would fix the issue my Kinect kept reporting about it being \\"unable to see the floor\\"... Nothing. Even after getting a new TV stand and placing the Kinect with Zoom RIGHT at the edge of it, it made no difference. So, for me, that was the last possible thing I could've tried to get the Zoom to work for me, and it still doesn't.<br /><br />I've already initiated my return of the Zoom to Amazon. Nyko's Zoom does NOT work for me.<br /><br />* ~ *<br /><br />Okay, so, like most everyone else out there that had preordered the Zoom, I couldn't wait to receive mine. It's simple to set up: cut tape tabs on box. Remove Zoom-containing green box inside of protective, informative product sleeve. Remove instruction guide & insert. Remove Zoom from casing & plastic bag. Remove antistatic film from Zoom. Slide Zoom... wait, turn on Xbox, go to Kinect settings, adjust tilt of Kinect. Turn Xbox off. NOW tilt Zoom over Kinect camera/lenses. Turn Xbox on. Grab calibration card. Stand 4' from Kinect. Calibrate Kinect. Yay! It worked! Choose game. Start game. Wait, what the Hell?!? Why the Hell does it look like I'm halfway sunk into the floor?!? Crap for crap! Ugh!<br /><br />*Sigh*. Fiddle with TV mount on which Kinect is seated. Remove Kinect from TV mount. Separate plastic frame piece from stand. Use Dremel & flex shaft to cut away plastic from front of frame against which Kinect is bumping when Kinect tries to find the floor in normal game calibration. Reassemble stand & replace Kinect into stand. Put back on top of TV. What?!? What the Hell do you MEAN the Kinect STILL can't see the floor?!?...<br /><br />THIS was my Zoom experience, and it only got worse. And no, before you start asking, I'm not a total and complete idiot, technologically speaking or otherwise. I simply found that the Zoom shortened \\"distance\\" enough that the Kinect now couldn't see the floor, because, now that the camera's \\"view\\" was perpetually zoomed in, the floor was blocked by the edge/lip of my entertainment center, REGARDLESS of whether I placed the Kinect below my TV, or in the mount that I have attached to the top of my TV. Neither position made any difference. And I found that placing my Kinect (with the Zoom attached) below my TV, on the edge of my entertainment center, only served to move the Kinect's focal point further down. My Kinect focused on my knees as the center of the screen when placed below the TV, so adjusting positioning with the Zoom attached didn't help at all.<br /><br />After trying everything that I could think of for an hour and a half, I gave up on trying to \\"tweak\\" it. SUPER disappointing, because I was just CERTAIN that the Nyko Zoom was going to fix ALL of my limited apartment space issues with the Kinect. Thankfully, the only game that I'd played pre-Zoom that seemed truly affected by the distance was/is Your Shape: Fitness Evolved. That was the game that, with the Zoom in place, now showed me as halfway submerged in the floor... Interesting, but not fun for workout purposes.<br /><br />Long story short, if you happen to have your Kinect mounted to the top of your TV via one of those clips, and you want to use the Zoom, you'll need to ensure that your TV is flush with the front edge of your entertainment center/TV stand. I have a stand upon a stand, and my TV is set further back from the edge of my entertainment center in order to ensure the safety of the equipment beneath it. Therefore, in my case, the Zoom doesn't work.<br /><br />Great as it may be for others, Nyko's Zoom just might not work for everyone out there. Case in point: me. *Sigh*.

0843178388|5.0|Maybe it's my weird sense of humor, but I find this Mr. Men book in particular to be quite funny! My kids and I love all the \\"For instance.\\" sentences in the book. We like to read it in funny voices and they crack up like crazy. It's our favorite Mr. Men book!
1439136653|5.0|Wow! This book was definitely a good read. I love true stories. It's a totally easy read, with lots of different stories of this guys life that are both sad and triumphant. I chose this book for our bookclub and so far everyone really likes it.
B002UZCJ8Y|2.0|Bruce Willis plays an FBI agent in this syfy action film based on a graphic novel. I found the movie a little short at one hour and about twenty minutes. It ends too soon and their is not enough of his final ordinary world. I would give it a 2 out 5 stars because the spectacle hugely out weighed the story. Willis' character had the only real character development. Most of the other characters were easy to read and almost seemed fact. Also I was disappointed with its side plots. It is a tougher movie to connect with because in our technological age we don't really know what it would be like to have a surrogate or something like it. I really enjoyed the premise of the film. The moral behind the movie is a little weak. It attempts to say that we should live our lives through a robot, but we should live our own lives. It also taught that people love us for who we are and we don't have to put on a face or fake our character for them to love us. The film is worth renting if you can't find anything better. I would recommend for Junior High and up because of the violence. There is not much sexual innuendo in it except for a scene near the beginning in a club and then a couple goes outside and start to take clothes off before getting caught.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The 30 Day Shred is an awesome work out.  It really kicks your ass.  My fiance and I love it.  At first you are sore but you want to keep doing it.  You feel stronger and in good shape.
B00275EHJG|4.0|I really enjoyed the third part to this trilogy. I would give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. I is worth going and seeing in the theaters but you should really enjoy before you should buy it. The story carries really well. There is some pretty good action when the toys try to escape from a day care. The movie shows a lot of character depth. Woody shows character throughout the movie. I like some of the new toys in the movie like Barbie and Ken. They bring a little extra comedy to the film. I saw the movie in 3D at the theaters but I didn't really see that much of a difference. I think I would've been fine and still thought the movie was really good without 3D. It did add some depth to different scenery but besides that I really didn't notice the 3D. Overall, I would recommend it for any family. I'd say save your money and just watch the 2D because there isn't too much of a difference.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|another hit from this band. a favorite in my collection right now! defintiely recommened trying it out if you havent heard them before.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|\\"Forgiveness liberates the soul. It removes fear. That is why it is such a powerful weapon.\\" - Nelson Mandela<br /><br />I really enjoy the movie. I'm going to to give it 4 out of 5 stars. Worth renting and I am planning on buying it. Clint Eastwood directs Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon in this South African sports thriller. Nelson Mandela (played by Freeman) becomes President of a post-civil war South Africa and gambles his political career on the South African Rugby Team, Captained by Francois Pienaar (played by Damon). Madela is the protagonist and leads an awesome band of actors and actresses. The spectacle of the movie comes at perfect times during the rugby matches. Mandela is faced with the problem of uniting a country and faces it head on. The title, Invictus, is a short Victorian poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley. The poem was Mandela's inspiration while in prison for twenty seven years. Pienaar plays a great sidekick to Manedla, he becomes inspired by Mandela's unconditional faith in the team to win the world cup. I recommend this movie for all ages, it is great movie for families as well as thrill seekers.<br /><br />\\"...I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.\\" - Invictus
B003ZSJ212|2.0|My God, will the overblown opinions about this series of movies ever end?  Probably not.  The simple fact that there are numerous versions, updates, re-edits, additions, improvements, & abolishments is proof that historic interest in Star Wars has developed a society of mental goof balls.  These are moviews after all.  It's not like Luke and Han and Chewy are sitting around the Intergalactic Cantina pontificating on how they let the universe down by not putting the best version of their story on blu-ray.    Here's the truth for me - I won't buy this version, nor will I go into painstaking detail on the pros and cons of this release over all the others.  I live in the here and now, not the glorified past of how a movie featuring space puppets made me a better appreciator of art, or a successful business man.  These movies remain great fairy tales, nothing more than a retelling of stories we've all heard before in nursery rhymnes and through Shakespeare.  My memories of the original 3 are the same as many others, and I too was disappointed in the later 3.  But we can't be kids forever.  If we hold on to our childhood fantasies too long we become ignorant and obscene.  Just read the other 1000+ posts here to confirm that.    So grow up you queers.  Rely on your memories to validate how great these movies are.  I'll occassionally pull out the old VHS tapes and watch the original trilogy as it was meant to be seen; slightly hazy, scratchy and complete with the occassional mistake that kept the story grounded as nothing more than a fantasy.    For those of you seeking perfection and an endless list of what should be included/excluded from this set, may the force be with you.  I know George will gladly continue to take your money and promise further versions that eventually lead viewers back to where it all started in a galaxy far, far away.
B002WY65VU|4.0|I usually don't like horror themed movies but Zombieland and Shawn of the Dead are two Comedies that I liked watching. Zombieland jumps right into a world of that is full of zombies are sick from one man eating a hamburger. Columbus, the protagonist survives by his list of rules. The rules is the beginning of the comedy because of the way they first explain and show them and then throughout the movie the rules randomly pop up. This movie is very gory and does have a significant amount of foul language. There is no sexual innuendo besides a scene early on where a cute girl falls asleep on Columbus on the couch just because she is so scared. I liked how the writer put Tallahassee, the critic, with Columbus throughout the whole movie. They make a good polar opposites tag team. Tallahassee is the rough and tough character that survives through just plain killing the zombies; where Columbus survies through strategy and the rules. I give the movie a 3.5 out of 5 stars. I haven't bought it yet and I probably won't unless it goes on sale, but it is still worth renting more than once. I wouldn't recommend it for families or people that can't handle bloody gore in a movie or a high amount of language.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|This is my first set of wireless cans for the Xbox. The simulated surround works really well, they do a great job on positioning and are comfortable for multiple hours of use. The wireless has yet to present any issues with my Xbox's wifi and the chat function worked flawlessly.    Setup was easy, less than 15 seconds honestly. The headphones have a nice and simple set of controls built on them and battery life has been good so far, 2 AAAs and Ive put at least 8-9 hours on them so far.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I love this app its faster than weatherbug but it downfall is that it can't find you if you are using gps.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|This thing is a piece of junk, I played with it for 4 hours trying to get it to work with no luck, and to top it off it scratched the front of my sensor, wonder if they'll replace that too, I got cheated out of 25 dollars and destroyed my kinect in the process, yeah I used that cheap lens cover they sent with it but it was a cheap as the zoom itself.
B000VS6R26|5.0|Ok, I have seen this movie when it came out in 1997, bought it on DVD but I just viewed the 10th anniversary edition. I will say until the Blu-Ray comes out this DVD by far looks and sounds better than the compressed single disc copy released years ago. That being said, I watched this because it has James Cameron commentator track. Which for any fan of the movie or director will appreciate. Also how accurately detailed the film is, (albeit some cinema latitude is used) what the cast and crew went through (PCP poisoning via the food), plus how big the Titanic set was. I am looking forward to the re-release in the theaters.
B004SKQAJI|3.0|I was very dasappointed in this show.  The music sounded like a kids music box for most of the show and grated on my nerves after awhile.   I can't understand why he didn't include some of the thousands of great Irish musicians.  The dancers were great but the outfits were just gawdy to say the least.  Overall very disappointing or maybe just spoilt by their previous outstanding shows.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|Since my dvds arrived, I have had to limit myself so I dont finish off the set too quickly.    Having watched \\"La Femme Nikita\\" and enjoying it, I am glad the new Nikita is even more entertaining, and it has less low talking, and a far better Michael.....    Highly recommmended to anyone wanting a good spy drama with a sexy lead.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an amazingly intriguing death journey through the life of Katniss Everdeen that left me hanging on Suzane Collins' every word! Pure fantastic liturature!
0679759328|3.0|I thought the writing was very nice, but I didn't find the story very compelling.  I couldn't figure out what period Hotel Du Lac was set in.  I wasn't drawn to any of the characters, though I felt they were, for the most part, real characters.   The main character was dull and not very likeable, but that may've been the point.    I expected the main character's past to be more interesting. I was disappointed when I learned the reason she was in \\"hiding\\".   But if you enjoy reading stories about a characters perception of people then you may enjoy it. All observing, no real movement.  I congratulate the author on her award and for completing her work.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|First positives:  the meeting of private Zoller and Mme Mimieux is a masterpiece, as well as the lunch with Goebels.  I saw these scenes umpteen times courtesy of incessant replying at dish network and I firmly stay behind saying it's outstanding on all levels.  Also, the long first chapter, entirely owned by Waltz who has clearly been brilliant all along, comes across very well first few times.  Everything else is highly dubious, that is 75% of the movie.  Tarantino enjoys in engaging dialogues and stories that connect various roles in the movie but here this all comes mostly disjointed with some absurdly stupid developments at the end of the movie.  Pitt is completely lost in his role because it is so hopelessly written, nothing to do with him.  Tarantino's propensity for violence is worrying on a medical level, nothing to do with art, some of the scenes are not far from products of a troubled mind.  Overall, this picture enjoys such fame and attention mostly due to being made by QT - otherwise, I guess the critique would be a great deal harsher.  Way behind his best works.
1609611543|5.0|If  you like donuts then don't read this book.  This is the part in the matrix where neo has to decide between the red or the blue pill. Can you handle the truth?
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a story that is very inspiring and a testament to the strength of the human spirit.  Victoria has lived more life in the first 10 years of her life than any child should have to.  Even though she has baggage she still continues to try and better herself and her life.      The way the author ties the flowers' names into the storyline is very well done. Learning the meanings of flowers was very interesting and added alot to the book.     The author has presented the characters so well that as you read this book they come to life and you are drawn into their life. You are feel their pain when they are troubled and happy when things are going good for them.  Grant is a very interesting character and shows us that if someone really loves you, the way Grant does Victoria, they accept you for what you are no matter what and are still there when you're ready to work through it.    A great read!!!
030788743X|5.0|I purchased this book for myself, a hard-core science fiction fan who felt she was out of reading options and so had to resort to a video game book set in the near future.  I never liked Tron in the 80's and anything that reminds me of Tron now is immediately off the list.  I was a little afraid this would be a Tron - but I needn't have worried.  I haven't enjoyed a book this much since The Hunger Games.  Very easy to read, fast paced, yet thoughtful narrative really develops our protagonist.  I do wish authors would nix the environmental BS in the near future dystopia - it's funny, with all the really dating name brand stuff (which I normally HATE in anything science fiction, but which totally works here) the environmental thing will be what really dates this book in the future.  So, like I said - I bought this book for myself but now have it on my video-game obsessed 9th grade teen's reading list for our homeschool year.  This story might be what seals the deal with him as far as the whole reading vs. gaming war goes.  A+++ 5 stars totally fun and interesting book.  Well worth the outrageous publisher Kindle price, if you're worried about that.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This is a very good movie. How he manages to get out of a messy situation is well done. Making people think is a good thing.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|If you are a true fan of the once great Star Wars then don't buy this product. You wont get the true essence of Star Wars. What you will get, however, are three prequel movies that hang out at the same club as Alien3 and Wild Wild West does. A movie where at least 20 minutes worth of a Tatooine scene are completely butchered with ridiculous amounts of cgi that clash with the great practical and special effects of the time; and Greedo shoots first (wtf?!). A mostly, and surprisingly, unaltered episode 5 with nothing really blasphemous coming to mind. And a completely and utterly UNWATCHABLE episode 6 that has so many changes done to it that it is a crime. The last 15 are so atrocious and appalling that if your the cynical type you'll be laughing at the end.     The original trilogy has been brutally raped and is almost unrecognizable. Really the only way to make it better is to stop succumbing ourselves to the temptations of owning the original trilogy on Blu-Ray because they are no longer the 'Original Trilogy', and to boycott this product. If enough people do it we may one day be able to show our kids the real beauty that it should be to watch the legendary Original Trilogy, with all its essence and glory intact, in prestigious HD. Make it so (Star Trek reference FTW).    EDIT: I originally gave it five stars even though I completely disapprove of this product, so now it's been lowered back down to the rating it deserves. Also, giving it stars is my artistic right. However, after hearing a huge outcry from the worried fans who saw my flaws I decided that it would be best to listen and give them what they deserve.
006029647X|5.0|Let's face it, the Little House books are awesome classics!  But the Read-Aloud edition gives you imaginations of the family huddled around and enjoying the story together.  If you haven't seen the Read-Aloud edition in person, it is a larger hardback format (about 8 1/2 x 11).  Looks great, and can be passed on to your grandchildren.
1402766785|4.0|I own a number of anatomy books and find having them really helps when trying to understand basic human anatomy or when trying to understand what happens to the body in movement.<br /><br />I've already done several studies from this book.  It does seem a bit dated and some of the drawings are not clear.  BUT OTOH...it repeatedly fills in blanks and offers insights not found in my other books.
B004KV92ZE|5.0|My friends and I, one day, decided to have a movie marathon day.  On that day, Kung-Fu Panda was selected for viewing.  I'll admit, I was skeptical at first; for one, it was a kiddie movie, and two, it starred Jack Black (his acting style does not agree with me nor does his comedy).  However, after watching the movie in its entirety, I was surprised with how good it was.  It managed to have that kid-able-to-watch quality to it without being cheesy or dumbed-down.  It is now one of my favorite movies, and it looks stellar in HD.  I highly recommend this film to those who like animation (particularly CG animation), martial arts, action, and comedy movies.
1439181780|5.0|hi the secret the power is outstanding i would encourage anyone who has watched the secret the movie to get this book and read it over and over until it becomes your habitual way of thinking and if you keep studying and learning about the law of attraction you are going to be wonderfully surprised on how it will change your life it has for me thank you.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Reviews seem to be very positive or very negative among people who actually have used this.    In my case, it doesn't work. Games that are doing very coarse body tracking (the sports games, I noticed, are fine) seem to work relatively well. You do get to play in less space.    That said, this dramatically impacts fine-grained tracking. Apps that are very sensitive to your position (Leedmees, for example) are basically useless with it, because your skeleton skips all over the place. Menus become very hard to navigate because hand tracking is very inconsistent. The hand pointer slides off the button targets. The fish-eye effect also causes people who are standing off-center to be seen by the Kinect as standing at an angle -- something that appears to mess up games like Dance Central.     Another problem, with games that involve moving front-to-back -- the Kinect is calibrated to know how the appearance of your body changes as you move forwards and backwards, and adjust that so it knows how far away you are. Because of the fish-eye effect with this, it sees your front-back motion as being exagerated the closer you are to the TV, which will impact games that work along that axis.     I also suspect, but got tired trying to determine for sure, that it really causes issues if you have a low ceiling.     Re-calibration didn't help, particularly with the hand tracking problem.     If you have a lot of problems with space, maybe $30 is worth it as an experiment, but (at least in my case) the Zoom is useless.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One is a fantastic book that allows 40-somethings and up to revel in their knowledge of the 80's.  The premise is wonderful - imaging the death of Steve Jobs and a giant hide-and-seek in a MMORPG game to determine who inherits the controlling shares of Apple.  Throw in futuristic computer interfaces, 80's pop-culture minutiae, worldwide poverty, mix well and you have this book.    Well written, completely believable, suspenseful and loaded with geek culture, but even non-geeks will enjoy it.  While there is a passing reference to avoiding rape and masturbation and blowup dolls, I still found it suitable for my 12yo.  He devoured it and started plotting how to make the game real.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who lived in the 80's, anyone who is a geek, or anyone who likes mysteries.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|As a new version of a book with as many adaptations as `Jane Eyre' (some versions more forgotten than others), this film needed to be a fresh look at an old classic, and as faithful as possible in 2 hours. In my opinion, it's as good as it could be while ticking all of those boxes. (This review is rather long, but it covers, I think, all possible concerns.)    A film called `Jane Eyre' needs a believable title character and Mia Wasikowska is perfect for Jane - I didn't expect to be so impressed. She's quiet but she lets rays of light slip out, showing her imagination beneath (which is exactly how Rochester describes Jane in the book). She shows Jane's first-person narration through her stunning skill with expression - one non-spoilery example is her utterly relatable mortification when Jane recognises Pilot.     Michael Fassbender is certainly the best-looking Rochester I've ever seen but beauty truly is of little consequence - he's also the most charismatic, showing the character's playful side while retaining the gruffness that a lot of other portrayals seem to focus on. Personally I found that the chemistry between Jane and Rochester was particularly arresting and their scenes together were very charged, as much due to what was said as what wasn't. Put it this way - when I picture Jane and Rochester, I now picture these two. Beforehand, I had always pictured Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens - not because it was the latest or only adaptation I'd seen; it was the first, and I've seen 3 others since.     The supporting cast is predictably brilliant - Judi Dench as the friendly but somewhat prim housekeeper Mrs Fairfax, and Jamie Bell as the generous but insensitive St. John, are obviously excellent, but I think special mention needs to go to the young girls who played Jane and Adèle (and to an extent Helen), who, when on screen, weren't eclipsed at all by the adults. Subtle facts round out the atmosphere. At night, the only light is indeed creepy candlelight - an accuracy often left out for convenience. I really liked little detailed inclusions such as Jane's rural accent, Adèle actually speaking French, the focus on Jane's passion for drawing - including actually seeing the pictures - and the inclusion of music within the story. Mrs Fairfax's despair when not only Adèle but also Jane is fascinated by Rochester's abrupt shift from playing the piano to shooting birds was a charming illustration of how the two leads are similarly in need of intellectual stimulation from each other.    It's also worth mentioning that the dialogue directly repeated from the book is actually memorable dialogue. I laughed aloud in the cinema at 'And now I see you're fascinated by the flowers on the rug.' I loved Jane's impassioned 'Equal - AS WE ARE!' Rochester saying tormentedly, 'I could snap her with finger and thumb but she still won't yield' was an unusual way to do that scene, which is usually not desperate enough or too soppy. I did, however, wince at the fact that they couldn't resist turning 'whence' into 'from whence' at one point.    All the key scenes were included, and more than any other adaptation has done, they made me smile irrepressibly just like the book. Some people haven't liked the way the film starts in the middle of the story, or doesn't dwell on the beginning, but I thought it was very well-judged - it's a change, plus I've always found the non-Rochester parts of the story hard-going when placed chronologically. They covered the whole story, with the non-Rochester parts given the importance that most readers give them (me, in any case). Jane's friendship with Helen was heartwarming without being overly long, its effect on Jane touchingly shown not by the usual drawn-out sentimentality but by a scene in which the adult Jane has painted Helen after remembering her days at Lowood. The tension between Jane and St. John was spot on - and I absolutely adored an additional view that the writers gave us into Jane's psyche during theseparation part.     The only thing that they totally left out was the fortune-teller scene. This was somewhat thankfully forgotten, as it would be hard to film it faithfully AND sensitively; however, as the point of that scene was supposed to be Rochester trying to determine Jane's feelings, I felt as if one single scene was taken for granted and they should have replaced it with that. It was no particular scene - but that was just it. The reason I love Jane and Rochester so much is that they're not one of those overrated `misconceived animosity turns into love via good deed' couples (P&P, anyone?!) - they took to each other instantly and thought it too good to be true. I think it needed *one* more scene to show their mutual pleasant shock at finding an affinity with someone so unexpectedly, despite age difference (also strangely unmentioned). Genuine chemistry between *characters* and not actors is even harder to show in a film, and it was about 95% perfect, but seeing as they had actors who portrayed the characters accurately, they could have made it 100% perfect in even just one more scene - so it was somewhat frustrating.     (SPOILER) I also really liked the way the film dealt with Bertha. I find that the somewhat stereotyped, underdeveloped portrayal of Bertha in the book is one of the few ways in which Charlotte Brontë did go with the conventions of her time. It can be problematic and most adaptations deal with its vagueness by making her some kind of supernatural foreign creature. This version is much more sensitive; Rochester mentions the fact that his dislike of her wasn't due to her madness, that he tried to live with her for 4 years and refused to condemn her to maltreatment in an asylum - and notably it didn't glamourise the fire and her death with a jarring 'flashback' as is so often done. It's a sort of simpler alternative to `Wide Sargasso Sea'. I found the fact that Bertha, too, receives sympathy, and that Fortune is the only real 'antagonist', made the Jane/Rochester story much more profound.    I've given this 5 stars - even though there are things I'd have liked to see, in other versions where they're included, the cinematography, pace and characterisation are nowhere near as striking. For fans of the book who want brilliant representations of the key scenes in the story, I can't stress enough that this version does them outstandingly. In a way, it's good that the whole progression isn't covered because while the film was stunning, it makes the book something that people can go back to, and not just to discover the characters in their true sense, as with many adaptations - rather, to rediscover the same characters from the film, just more of them. It more than made up for my fury that it came out in the US months before it did here in the UK - my wait was well worth it. This film is literally as much of Charlotte Brontë's story as could be put on film in 2 hours, and I ran home to return to the book with pleasure.
1596912863|5.0|To me, it's not a favorite novel unless you want to keep reading it over and over again. This is really my new favorite novel. The voice is clever and funny, the setting is awesome (it can't get better than an anacronistic Jane-Austen-camp for grown ups),and the romance is clean but sexy (what a rare combo in today's fiction). The ending made me cry with joy. Literally. LOVED IT.<br /><br />I've been telling all my friends, \\"You've GOT to read this book!\\"
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Shame on the marketing of these films, claiming to have laboured over the inadequacies of the dvd releases. Lightsabers change colour every other shot and Vader has a mostly pink saber in ESB. Come on Lucasfilm. Put in the effort and make consistent changes rather than arbitrary changes here and there. Word of mouth is so important and for the last fourteen years you have consistently alienated true fans with cheap effects and ill judged changes. Look at Adywan's Revisited edit and see what could be. ILM must be holding their heads in shame if they have anyone left with talent who hasn't jumped ship to WETA.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|I have seen Trombone Shorty, or Troy Andrews, recently playing at the NSJF 2011 with dr John and I liked the show very much... it was one big musical party.   After the show I got what I guess is his second album: \\"Backatown\\"; I will probably get this one too.   I listened to the samples and they give the same impression.  Trombone Shorty is a talented new jazz musician from New Orleans. He sings and plays the trumpet, the keyboard, the drums/percussion and of course the trombone. He also writes a lot of his own material. As a trombone player he is not a lazy player but rather high energy combustion. Dont expect Ray Anderson.   I would love it if this guy teams up with the young likes of Bilal, Charlie Hunter, the Dirty Dozen, Leon Parker &c and I am sure he will.  Recommended
0743454537|4.0|I have a lot of mixed feelings about this book.  At times, I absolutely love it and other times I would just shake my head in disgust.  I think the majority of the time I did like the book though.<br /><br />Anna has always known why she was born, to save her sister.  Her sister has a rare type of cancer and Anna was genetically designed to be a perfect donor match.  What started as only needing stem cells though has turned into marrow transplants and other donations from Anna, with a big one looming in the future; a kidney.  But instead, Anna goes to a lawyer, who against his better judgment, takes up the case to get Anna medical emancipation so her parents can't force her to be a donor anymore.  In an already dysfunctional family this takes it toll though with no one knowing what the right steps are to take.<br /><br />Anna was an ok character.  For being the main character I think more of her personally could have been included.  But maybe it was written for her to be an extension of her sister.  Her sister Kate was even less of a force in the book, often taking a background despite the fact that everything centered on her.  Her brother Jesse just provided some more conflict but was actually quite likable despite his troublesome ways.  I did think that the side story between Anna's lawyer and Guardian ad litem was somewhat distracting and didn't add to the story at all, which detracted from their characters.  I have to say I couldn't find any redeemable qualities in Anna's mother Sara.  Sara was too obsessed with one child and while I think she was meant to show how a parent has trouble with all the decisions in life, she just was so far to horrible that it probably wasn't a realistic portrayal of a person in that situation.<br /><br />The concept of the novel is a pretty good one.  And it explored the emotions behind such volatile decisions as well.  The writing was clear and easy to read, even if it tended to the dramatic at times.  The whole book is from a bunch of the different character's views so the perspectives of what's happening are always changing.  I think the main part of this book is that it is so controversial and the author has a hard time hiding her bias as to what side she is on.  It is a good book for discussion though and I can see why its a favorite of book clubs.  I think the biggest flaw of the book, which many others have also said, is the ending.  It just leaves you shaking your head wondering what Picoult was thinking when she wrote it.<br /><br />Not a book that I'm always content with, but it does make you think.  Perhaps just skip the ending and the side story about the lawyer and it would be great.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper<br />Copyright 2004<br />423 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

1934030198|4.0|Very nicely written and very detailed. For me this book was way too technical and difficult to understand, but it surely covers everything. Not good for the first time triathlete, but great for the experienced ones.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I thought the book started off a little bit slowly, as many science fiction stories do, since the author has the burden of laying out the world and its rules as well as introducing the characters. However, once it got going, it didn't disappoint.      The trip through 80s culture was entertaining and I appreciate that the author didn't get so bogged down in random 80s factoids that it distracted from the story. Most of the references were woven into the plot and had a reason to be included. As someone else wrote, this is a classic quest novel and a good one, I think. The action never lags, there's no sag in the middle and the ending is satisfying.     Oh and as a bonus, it's fiction about computers that didn't make me groan in agony, which is rare. It's not super technical--hey, it's the future, he can imagine whatever he wants--but nobody has \\"magical\\" hacking abilities either. Things are explained a little and suspension of disbelief is possible.      It would make a great summer blockbuster special effects laden movie. Wouldn't it be nice to see one that actually has a decent story!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love my Kindle! I use my Kindle and have the app installed on all my android devices and PCs. I think it has come a long way since the beginning. The only thing I wish the app had was a barcode scanner. it would be SO NICE to be able to scan a barcode in the Kindle store rather than having to take the extra time to type the title in (yes, I know I am being lazy, but Google books has this feature and it makes it SO easy to instantly add books and download samples).
0553801473|3.0|This is a series for the patient reader. With books appearing once every five years or so, with each book weighing in at over a thousand pages, and with the later books in the series trading in plot development for world building, only the serious fan will have the strength to keep the faith.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, this book did very well in comparison to AFFC. Unfortunately, the service manual for my dishwasher would have done very well in comparison to AFFC.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the 900+ pages in this book were very easy to read. I actually didn't begin to get annoyed until I was in the last quarter, and all of the plot lines were still showing no signs of life. I skimmed the last 100 pages, getting more frustrated than ever, and almost missed a couple of season-finale cliff hangers (which unfortunately are losing their impact).<br /><br />As others have said, this book suffers from a lack of tighter editing. All the major characters are reduced to meandering through their lives. Daenerys and Jon suffer the most from this treatment, but even the Greyjoys and Starks don't fare much better. The major plot-advancing incidents could be summarized in less than 6 bullet points.<br /><br />It's a tragedy that this series has devolved from its breathless pacing in the first few books, into a walk through waist deep mud. It almost makes me wish I wasn't so invested in what's happening in Westeros.<br /><br />Of course, it's far easier for me to criticize this book than to write something this epic.<br /><br />So, I'll keep the faith, and wait for the next installment. Hopefully, I'll even remember enough of the story to enjoy this ride to its conclusion.<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B00004XONN|5.0|An excellent album. Rather cold and alienating at first, but that seems to be what they were going for, and it builds. If you like Radiohead, or any band similar, you will likely enjoy this album.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I hardly ever write reviews but feel compelled to do so here because the changes to the originals are so insulting to both the audience and loyal fan base of star wars. Initially I was prepared to overlook the changes for the sake of something very special now enhanced in 1080p glory. However having seen these changes and how pathetic they are this is not something anyone should put up with. I've waited this long for star wars in blu ray, I'm happy to wait longer for either the originals in blu ray or 3d blu ray.     I must admit I thought everyone was just nitpicking and being overly harsh with the changes, but see them for yourself (or better yet YouTube it and save yourself the money) and disappointment is a given. I wouldn't even classify myself as a fanboy either so god only knows what all you real die-hard fans feel about it all!  Shame on George Lucas.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Original movies with a new high-quality transfer, with the effects cleaned up, please. No one should waste their money on this.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Thanks to all the reviews informing me that the blu-ray issue had all these updates. It gave me warning in time so I could cancel my pre-order. If the original theatrical version isn't available then I don't want this set.
0316044695|5.0|This book was slightly tedious at first when he was describing all their training but it was necessary to fully understand how amazing these men are.  When I got to the part about what happened to him and his team and everything they went through and all that they witnessed and the men who tried to save them my heart broke for them and their families. I sobbed for a good 20 minutes.  I couldn't keep it together after reading it. Just buy it and read it.  You won't regret it.

B005COO1X6|3.0|....is accurate.  The characters of this short story are well put together throughout the telling of the \\"mud-spattered car\\" that sits at Mile Marker 81.  I was able to see the difference in the brothers - and why Pete, the little brother simply decided to go off on his own.      This may be though of as \\"King back again,\\" yet I've read most of his works and this one failed with its ending.  It either failed, or King is going to pick this story back up and finish it in the proper manner.  The way people \\"disappeared\\" was way too fast for my taste - I could have easily taken in more suspense as each approaches this car....      I truly enjoy King and most of his novellas, stories, novels, tales, etc.  This one?  Well, not so much.  I also kept wondering WHEN Pete was going to wake up from his Vodka-induced state!  I mean, cum'mon!!      Frankly, I could have left this one alone and been just fine.  I won't say it's wasted dollars, but I'll really, really look at the next reviews of the next Kindle book I purchase - and ignore the \\"professional reviewers\\" prejudice.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|man am I pissed right now, I really wanted to see this movie unfortunately the blu ray does not work! I thought it was a bad disc at first and so I had amazon ship me another only to find out that it does not work either!!! I updated my firmware and it still doesnt work... All of my other blu rays including the Thor blu ray work just fine. I cant even get a picture to come up... this is crazy because I spent $25 on this thing which is something I dont do too often. If anybody else had problems let me know please. I own a sony ps3.
0882847953|5.0|This not a book that hand holds you, as description and text is lacking but with the assistance of a decent teacher,  its damn near the perfect and most systematic way to learn to read rhythm,  I take most of my guitar Students (I'm a guitarist) through this book and they come out with  a solid sense of rhythm!!!!I think Rhythm is the most important part of music.. and worth the time to improve and control!!     I really like how the book covers almost every conceivable way of breaking up a bar and has the summary exercises as well as the longer form ones. each page can be practiced in many different ways which means this book never gets old.  for example I often do the following with each exercise ( on guitar)  1. play through on a single note.  2. play with a single chord.  3. play through with  keeping the underlying subdivision going but only fretting the notes that are written (especially usefully to train guitarist to play funk rhythms).    the sky is the limit...but again I'd stress the need for a teacher.. oh and always use a metronome when using this book.
0553801473|3.0|I loved the first 3 books in this series, could not put them down.  The 4th book, A Feast For Crows, was slow moving and a little boring.  I hate to say that, but I had grown to love these characters and then he rarely visited them in the foruth and fifth books.  I was honestly hoping that all the cliffhangers would end in this fifth book.  It didn't happen.  We occasionally got to see somehting else happen to some of the characters left out of the 4th book, but still no ending.  Am I really going to have to wait forever to get an end to this book?  Is there a 6th one I din't know about?  And why in the heck would HBO start a series (marvelously done by the way) to a series of books not even finished???  Apparently they did not read the last two snore fest books that I just finished (books 4 & 5).  I am sorry, but I am ready for an ending and to just move on, this is ridiculous.  I mean how long is the author going to drag this out?  My daughter got me an autographed copy of the 5th book and I was thrilled because I thought it was the end and I would finally have the answers to what all has been going on.  NOT!  I just don't know if I would want to reccomend this series to anyone.
B001VNB54A|3.0|The main reason why The Pacific isn't as good as Band of Brother is pretty simple. Band of Brothers is nearly twice as long as the Pacific. That extra time gives the ability to develop the characters more. While watching the Pacific you're almost begging them to give you more background on the key players. To watch the relationships develop between the men like you did in BoB. It's still a good mini series don't get me wrong but it just could've been so much better. The music score is amazing. I just got it for $38.99 on their Gold Box Deal of the Day. If it was any more I wouldn't have bought it.
B000XA5K48|5.0|BAD A@@ MOVIE! Thank you so much for selling this DVD for me at such a low cost, and for it to come to me so quickly! The DVD is pretty much BRAND NEW! The case is perfect, as well as the DVD. No scratches whatsoever, I very much love it. Thank you, again. I really appreciate it.

B005974CDU|5.0|Living in 2011, with everything changing around us and life moving too fast, who would've expected that 90s music could re-appear again? Yes, Dream Theater gave us hope that good music still exists and perfection is a reality.<br /><br />I have waited for too long for this album, I felt that DT would find it difficult to carry on without Mike Portnoy, since he is the original member and let's be honest, most bands suffer in their albums after replacement members.<br />Along came Mike Mangini, a technical, educated, modest, and impressive team-worker. For all of you Portnoy lovers do not worry, you wont feel his absence, in fact, you will feel the advantage of the team-work and progressiveness.<br /><br />In this album, every listener should be satisfied, you want an easy-listening song you got it, you want ballads you got 3, you want progressive long songs with artistic solos you got 3 massive ones, and you want a closing orchestrated song, you've got Beneath the surface.<br /><br />James Labrie's voice is surprisingly perfect without any sign of mistake, I think MP's departure has given him space. John Myung's bass is deeper and heavier and even lyrically \\"Breaking all Illusions\\" he is a master of his own domain. John Petrucci has and will always be the one you rely on, his guitars are everywhere, his lyrics and even his presence makes you feel safe and gives you an ease. Mike Mangini's drumming is awesome and yet simple. To be honest, it is not about drums anymore! Progressive is a team effort, you get the song by listening to the 4 instruments blending into one song.<br />And Hey! No growling and no deep-thrash-rock drumming! (at one point Portnoy made me think I am listening to Kamelot!)<br /><br />This album is an album that will stay with us forever and listening to it more and more gives me the satisfaction and the happiness of the choice I made to listen to DT from the beginning.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|While the songs on Green Naugahyde seem to have more in common with Les Claypool's solo material than classic Primus albums such as Sailing the Seas of Cheese and Pork Soda, the material here is no less worthy.  It is great to finally have a complete album under the Primus moniker, with Larry Lalonde's outstanding guitar playing and amazing original drummer Jay Lane alongside Les Claypool.  The songs are interesting and performed very well as you would expect.  One note - this album may quality as a grower so don't be quick to judge.  Give it several listens before making your mind up.
B004132HZS|5.0|Every so often, I browse by this show on Netflix, and I just tell myself, \\"Nah, this doesn't look good. How can Sherlock Holmes be made into a modern television serious? They must be kidding me. This will most likely be a waste of time.\\" So I just totally skip the program without ever thinking about giving this show a benefit of the doubt.    I will just move on and watch other shows on Netflix. One day, I was just bored out of my mind, we had a hurricane warning in our area. I had nothing else interesting to watch on television except for the doom and gloom news about the hurricane that was set to hit our area. I was just left no option on television but to give Sherlock a shot.     Conclusion, I've watched all three episodes non-stop for five straight hours. I did not pause at all after each episode. It was just amazing. It was magnificent. It was far better than what I've expected. It was uniquely addictive. It was new and refreshing. I just don't know what else to say but to just watch it. Give it a shot. You will love it. If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan, rest assured, you will not be disappoint one bit by the modern theme. You will most likely be disappointed with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law's movie version. You would not be disappointed one bit with this one.     I liked it so much I bought a copy to keep with my Grenada collection. I definitely cannot wait for Series 2 to be broadcast next year. It really feels like a long wait now.     I just have to say that NOTHING out there can match this Sherlock Holmes. It is just disappointed that only 3 episodes were made at this time. I hope for at least +20 episodes in the future.
B005974CDU|5.0|Pardon the terminal alliteration but I couldn't help myself.  \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" is an album (yes, I'm old school, I still use the term \\"album\\") that serves as the quintessential example of the Shakespearean phrase \\"full of sound and fury, signifying ..........EVERYTHING.\\"  Riddle me this: What do you have when one starts with five extraordinarily talented musicians, mix elements from ELP, Trent Reznor, Alice in Chains, Limp Bizkit, Radiohead and 27 other musical influences and then infuse a solution comprised of steroids & nitroglycerine and shake vigorously?  Answer: A Dramatic Turn of Events.  Jordon shines brilliantly, LaBrie's vocals are emotive and spot on.  Petrucci is a bit restrained, but what he lacks in pyrotechnics he makes up for in deliberation and clarity.  Myung is more in the fore of the mix and just levels any other bass player on the planet with his performance.  The only dubious part of this compilation for me was the Mangini factor. Yes, he played and executed his parts flawlessly.  What seems to be missing is a footprint, a signature if you will, that emphatically declares his presence as a fully contributing member of the band.  Yet that may have been an impossible task considering that the songs were already written prior to his induction into the group.  With regard to this piece as a whole: To try and describe with words what one would find in this tour-de-force would border on the farcical, thus I leave it to your good offices to indulge yourself.<br /><br />Nature abhors a vacuum, and like the natural world, musicians and they're respective bands are meant to evolve.  With that in mind, I will add that I adore Mike Portnoy and relegate him to the very uppermost echelon of drummers without equivocation.  Yet could the very force of nature that is Portnoy whom served to thrust Dream Theater into the empyrean realms of prog-metal be the same force that was possibly hindering and confining the bands members?  In any event, there is no rut deep enough, nor chain long or strong enough to ever confine these supernatural musicians.  Welcome to the next evolution........  5 stars!<br /><br />PS I'm taking my son to Boston in less than a month to a meet and greet with the boys and then a concert at the Orpheum Theater.

B00445JSWS|1.0|Excuse me but have I just watched the same concert as these other reviewers with their raves about this sad spectacle?<br />If you want to watch a band that is slowly transforming into a grotesque travesty of itself, then this is the DVD for you.<br />Let me put my cards on the table. I have always viewed DM as God-like. Right up there with Kraftwerk as one of THE greatest bands of the 80s/90s.<br />I saw them way back in the Vince Clark days so yes I am as old as that! They blew me away then and the love affair has continued ever since.<br />Life sent me on my way to foreign lands for the last few decades; places where DM would never tour so I've had to follow them on CD/DVD. Their intermediate physical decline was thus hidden to me.<br />Recently I bought the anniversary reissue of \\"101\\" and enjoyed it all over again. DM at that point in time were truely vindicated visionaries. They could do no wrong. \\"Violator\\" was in the offing. \\"Black Celebration\\" was still fresh. \\"Music for the Masses\\" consolidated their stature as one of the greatest bands of the decade.<br />Tonight I watched in horror the absolute decline and fall into campness of my idols. This is something no DM fan should have to endure.<br />Dave Gahan looks and sounds totally finished. His opening lines of \\"A Question of Time\\" made him sound more like a nasal Joey Ramone than the young buck from the Rose Bowl. His lifestyle has clearly destroyed his voice.<br />The staging of the show features a huge, overly bright screen which I suppose is meant to mask the wrinkles and sags on Messeurs Gahan et Gores' faces. This and some dodgy crowd-shot angles means that the full horror of the aging process is not revealed in toto. However, Dave's lacklustre movements show his age. Once or twice he does the old mic swinging thing bit. Too often he looks tired and detached. He lets the crowd finish lines less as a homage to the iconic \\"Everything Counts\\" climax in 101, more because he looks knackered.<br />Anton Corbyn is obviously too pre-occupied with his own budding movie career to stop this fiasco and strangle it at birth.<br />Major low point: Dave grabs his crotch to emphasise \\"...have their fun with my little one (\\"A Question of Time\\"). Crude, unimaginative, a performer hoping to be edgy but instead just being embarassing.<br />I loved DM because, like Kraftwerk, they had no drummer. It felt great to love a band that were as far from Bon Jovi as a punk hairdo was from a mullet. Now though, there's some old drumming session rube up front and centre. Dave frequently turns to him as if to say \\"Who the hell are you? Oh well, at least I can rest up a bit while looking as if I'm intensely focussing on the rhythm.\\"<br />Alan Wilder's irreplaceable presence has also been auctioned off to another studio lizard who belatedly joins DM at the final bow. Who is he? Why is he? No idea. For all I know they could be Celine Dion mercenaries filling in time before her next Vegas stint. The horror, the ho-rror.<br />Is it a coincidence that Mode went into a decline after Wilder's departure. I think not. His classically trained ear focussed on the melody rather than the ugly over-produced noise that characterises so much of DM's output these days.<br />If in doubt, check out Wilder's classy but understated stage appearance with DM at the Albert Hall on Youtube. It says everything about where DM used to be and where they are now. A lot of the blame has to do with Dave Gahan's need to be a rawwwwk staaar, I'm afraid. He has destroyed the group as a result of his own inadequacies. No wonder Wilder walked.<br />Martin Gore seems determined to stay on stage to help his rehab-crippled buddy Dave, so he twangs on his guitar looking vexed and lost. Dave obviously cannot carry the show up front on his own anymore. Gore's solo efforts which looked so great when brief in 101 seem now, in extended form, camp and over-emoted. His expression throughout is one of pain. It matched my own agony as I watched DM parody themselves even as they fill stadiums to the brim.<br />The true debacle is left till the last song. Dave and Martin stumble out like two cabaret queens to sing a miserable version of \\"Waiting for the Night\\" where they forget the words, laugh when they should cringe and the whole thing fizzles out with a bow including the 2 or 3 proto-Dion stiffs. The bemused crowd almost sounded abusive as the sound dipped. I'm not sure which looked the more awkward. It was like some macabre, ghoulish Donny and Marie!!<br />DM fans are so fanatical that I expect a ton of abuse for this review. It seems that they have convinced themselves that this spectacle is something more than their band in a terminal decline. It is a prerequisite to suspend disbelief.<br />All I can guess is that they never saw them young, fresh and downright beautiful to behold. Those days are gone.<br />From now on for me its just the old DVDs so that they can never let me down again.<br />I used to be afraid that Dave Gahan was transforming into Axel Rose. Now I know that it's Mick Jagger. Over the hill. Mouthing a back catalogue. Searching for relevance beyond nostalgia. Still addicted to stadiums full of undiscerning plebs who just know the band from a Greatest Hits album. Pyrotechnics over product.<br />Goodbye DM. Thanks for the memories.<br />The DVD/CD? It's No Good!!<br />Update: Saw DM in Dusseldorf on their DeltaWhatever Tour in July 2013. All I'll say is (and I mean this emphatically): My review stands!!!!!d DM parody themselves even as they fill stadiums to the brim.<br />The true debacle is left till the last song.

B004OZOTSQ|4.0|** UPDATE **  All right, I figured it out.  It installed and ran just right.  No problems.  Sorry for the mis-information.  It works just fine on my Coby 7024.  ** END UPDATE **  Installed on my Coby 7024, but it wouldn't get past the initial startup.  I tried all the options and nothing happened.  Indications are that it works only for phones.  Maybe it's great and deserved 5 stars, but for my purposes it just didn't work.
B004RSCWZ2|2.0|I'm glad I'm not the only one who isn't afraid of telling it like it is...this just isn't an exciting CD. The songs are actually good...I'll give them that. They're original and fresh sounding. However, I wanted to hear more upbeat, harder edged material...there's just too many slow and soft songs on this CD...BORING. Come on, Trucks/Tedeschi...let's hear you guys tear it up! And I agree about the huge band being wasted...it's just not used enough. The brass hardly makes a real showing, and Mike Mattison is not featured enough on vocals, IMO.    Trucks and Tedeschi seem to have settled into a happy little rut here. I think it's great that they're enjoying playing with each other in the same band, but they need to start fighting so that the music can get more exciting!--lol. ROCK IT UP next time, guys!

It not only shows off the Hubble, it is also one of the best 3D viedos.

B0002KPIKA|4.0|It took me for a while to figure out the story is about Roman emperor, Nero and his mother because I didn't know anything about their personal gossips. So I understood all the jokes finally when I watched it at the second time after I read his biography.     They had outrageously colorful Rococo costumes and wigs. The stage setting was very minimalistic and goofy. And all the singers played unbelievably shallow characters with such goofiness.     And, the music was gorgeous. This is the one of early Handel's operas. Though it doesn't have the full maturity of his later works like \\"Faramondo\\" but still exceptionally beautifully written.     All the singers sung wonderfully, beautifully and comically.    Especially soprano Veronique Gens played very cunning but irresistibly charming title role who ambitiously plots to make her son emperor. Her voice was so beautiful. Countertenor, Philippe Jaroussky also sung wonderfully playing a teenage Nero who is not-so-smart mommy's boy with greedy ambitions. Also soprano, Ingrid Perruche sung with bright and beautiful soprano voice. Nigel Smith, Thierry Gregoire, Bernard Deletre and Fabrice Di Farco were all wonderful.    These are my favorite arias in this opera.    Come nube che fugge dal vento (Philippe Jaroussky)  Se vuoi pace (Veronique Gens)  Pensieri (Veronique Gens)  Bel piacere e godere fido amor (Ingrid Perruche)  Con saggio tuo consiglio (Philippe Jaroussky)  Qual piacer (Philippe Jaroussky)  E' un foco quell d'amore (Ingrid Perruche)  Io di Roma il Giove sono (Nigel Smith)  Tacero purche fedele (Thierry Gregoire)

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is absolutely masterful and after having read it, I can say that it has been without a doubt my favourite book of 2011. The Night Circus is one of those books that you come across very seldom and it's one of those books that leaves a lasting impression on the reader. The kind that you find yourself picking up and reading more than once, and every time you do read it again, another facet of it's brilliance is revealed.<br /><br />The prose is lyrical and almost poetic and with that same sense of fluidity Erin Morgenstern has created a world that leaves the reader with a longing to experience it for themselves. The book is a feast for the senses. As you are reading you feel the silk of a dress worn by one of the performers, taste the food at one of the midnight dinners, or smell the caramel in the air as you walk from tent to tent exploring all of the delights that the circus has to offer.<br /><br />I personally don't understand the comparison to the Harry Potter series. To me, the only thing that they share in common is that they are both written by extremely talented women, on paper, and they both deal with magic! That's it. To say that The Night Circus is the second coming of Harry Potter does a great disservice to both stories. The Night Circus is not a series, but rather one stand alone book. It is a richly written tale that uses the circus itself as a backdrop. It is not a book about magic. It is not a book about vanquishing the most evil wizard of all time. The Night Circus, at the end of the day, is a love story.<br /><br />The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is to me, much more than a book. It is an experience to be savoured and treasured by all of those who read it.<br /><br />*Note review written from a copy provided for review*
B005DZMODI|4.0|this is, by far, Eric Clapton's best effort since his 1992 release, on plugged. Clapton's solos are more inventive than they usually are, especially on the first half of the disc. Contrary to what some other reviewers are saying, this is not a short disc at all. Though there are only 10 songs on the CD, the shortest one is about four small, and a lost one is about 11 long. The vocals on this disc are decent in some places and very good in others. Marsalis and his are thrilling throughout, though there is one long and rambling solo and one of the last two tracks that is more reminiscent of bebop of 1940s and early 1950s then it is of traditional New Orleans jazz or hot jazz. The major drawback of this disc is the horrible vocals and total butcher of the lyrics on the last song, thanks to Taj Mahal. He clearly forgot the lyrics to a song that he rearranged, the traditional carina Carina or Alberta. He consciously chose to not sing the lyrics as the Mississippi sheiks or snarks Egeland would have gone. Mulhall sang the lyrics to his version of the song, though he obviously couldn't remember the words! Also, I am not sure why Clapton chose to send the lyrics to the lesser-known version of careless love, as opposed to the version that so many great musicians recorded; men like Lonnie Johnson and Jimmy Tarleton. This is especially strange considering how Clapton relied heavily on the guitar tuning and some of the lyrics made famous by Lonnie Johnson, on this album. Overall, though, this is one of the more affecting and well-done tributes to traditional blues and jazz that Eric Clapton has ever recorded.    Please six views the horrific grammatical errors in this review, as I am using a speech to text program.
B0058YPG1G|4.0|...but oh, man, it gets tiresome watching Walt make one unbeleivably bad decision after another.  He's supposed to be the smart one.  Meanwhile, he gets his brother-in-law back on his trail by intimating the dead guy they found isn't the real \\"Heisenburg\\", he buys $300 bottles of wine and a souped up sports car for his son.  He won't listen to sense from his wife - hey, Walt, how do you account for all this cash?  Oh, yeah, card shark!  His boss in an effort to make Jessie less of a liability has him team up with one of the muscle guys just to keep him busy, but Walter can't see the good in that - instead he brings in some of the local cleaning ladies to help clean up 'the lab' while Jessie's not there, whereon they are all deported back to Honduras afterwards!  Really, it's a joke how unreasonable and argumentative Walter has become - Jessie is seeming the sane one!   I started getting into this fourth season toward the end of the second episode, and once it gets going the season really does take off..   Just a note though.. I've had my reservations about Breaking Bad since Season 3 where one whole show was shot in the lab with them trying to kill a fly.  Whether or not it gave us insight into Walter's character it had seemed mainly like filler and that the writers were running out of ideas (note to the writers:  avoid too much time in the lab).  Well, I was sort of geared up for more of the same when I started Season 4 of Breaking Bad and the first episode didn't do a whole lot to change my general wariness..   However, by the end of the second episode and on, interest kicks in and holds out pretty strong for the bulk of the season but by the last few episodes it starts losing steam mainly due to too many plot contrivances.  The first is that Jessie starts dominating Walt, throwing him around and beating him up in a few scenes and that just looks fake.  There's no way Jessie would be throwing Walt around, who is a lot bigger, stronger, and with even more attitudethan when the show started with him as a mild mannered chem teacher.  For people who say this series is believable, explain that.  Then Walt makes a bomb all of a sudden - like hey, do they teach chem students that in grad school?  No, but perhaps they teach it to screenplay writers in \\"Plot Contrivance 101\\".  Unfortunately for the series,  scenes like this give the impression that they're grabbing at straws again.    Breaking Bad, Season 4 has many good moments, and many weak ones as well, and while the writing is way far-fetched (though fun mostly) to begin with, Cranston's acting in earlier episodes is sometimes so over-the-top as to be unbelievable (sad to say, most of the best scenes this season usually involve characters other than Walt somehow). Later, it's less his acting that's over the top, and more the ridiculousnous of the scenarios, like when we're supposed to accept that the drug boss poisons the child of Jessie's girlfriend with the cigarette Walt had given Jessie.. like, what??!!!  And that Jessie thinks Walt had something to do with it!  Puh-lease.    I've enjoyed this season more than the previous one, and a lesser season of Breaking Bad is still better than most, but what made the first 2 seasons so great was that it didn't go so far off the deep end as to completely defy the laws of logic.
B002U6CJO2|5.0|I was wondering How Ooshi would have updated his classic sci-fi anime film.  He apparently updated the music and added 3D to the film itself. Yes, this is the same famous Ghost in the shell, but the characters and the music are much clearer and sharper. it was worth the effort. I now have both versions and view both.
B005974C94|5.0|Some artists reach a point in their careers where you feel they have nothing left to prove. Wynton Marsalis has earned every accolade in the jazz world-nine Grammys in Jazz and classical music, and the first Jazz musician to win a Pulitzer prize for music (\\"Blood on the Field\\"}. Eric Clapton, of course, has been one of the top guitar gods for nearly five decades. Both of these accomplished musicians could coast at this point- something they have been criticized for in recent years. For this performance, live at Lincoln Center in April 2011, they made a bit of musical history.<br /><br />When Marsalis and Clapton decided on this project, they went after the sound of an early jump-blues band with a New Orleans vibe. This enabled the duo to give themselves latitude in instrumentation. The band is based on King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band (where Louis Armstrong first gained fame), but with the addition of guitar and keyboards. This culminated in a sound respecting Trad Jazz while acknowledging the music of today.<br /><br />The disc's opener, \\"Ice Cream\\" shows the group having a ball. Several members, including Marsalis sing the chorus in a fun fashion backing Clapton's lead vocal. In true Dixieland fashion, solos seamlessly follow each other. Victor Goines plays a lovely clarinet solo in \\"Joe Turner's Blues\\", followed by a very nimble Clapton. Hearing him in a Jazz setting is a real treat. The great Don Vappie plays some of the best banjo this side of Bela Fleck.<br /><br />After \\"Kidman Blues\\", Clapton engages the audience rather humbly, telling how intimidated he was by so many schooled Jazz musicians. Clearly, he is the star of this show, and his playing is a perfect fit with the Marsalis band.<br /><br />Reading the set list: do we need another \\"Layla\\"? This track is probably the biggest surprise on a disc filled with them. Clapton didn't plan on adding \\"Layla\\" to the show, but bass player Carlos Henriquez was insistent. Marsalis, Clapton and Goines all play engaging solos, and Clapton's voice just gets better with age. Along with pianist Dan Nimmer, long time Clapton collaborator Chris Stainton adds keyboards throughout the concert.<br /><br />Taj Mahal is a surprise guest vocalist on the gospel standard \\"Just a Closer Walk With Thee\\". He also guests on \\"Corrine, Corrina\\"- a bonus track not included on the CD. Here he gets to show his considerable skills on the 5-string banjo, followed by Clapton, Marsalis and second trumpeter Marcus Printup. Stainton is featured on electric piano (this guy does not age).<br /><br />Jazz at Lincoln Center is one of the most successful music projects to be recorded in recent years. Kudos to producers Marsalis, Clapton and Ashley Schiff Ramos for a great recording and to director Martyn Atkins for a fine DVD.gets better with age.

Now i must say after i was calibrated what a complete difference this makes in using the kinect. I feel like i am trying the device again for the first time. very fast and accurate response times motions way closer to the tv. i no longer have to move my furniture in order to enjoy motion controls. Funny thing the wife is now telling me that thing are to sensitive to her \\"movements\\" lol funny stuff. i highly recommend this for people who don't have a lot of room but want to enjoy the full use of the motion controls. i highly recommend this add-on for the kinect.

B0058ZPMYG|3.0|HESHER tells a tale that we've seen before: outcast boy (Devin Brochu) copes with a pill-popping father (Rainn Wilson) and a well-meaning but misunderstood grandmother (Piper Laurie).  He gets picked on by a bully, meets a beautiful outcast girl (Natalie Portman), and befriends a nihilistic loner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  Heartwarming chaos ensues.<br /><br />It took three people to write HESHER, which is a little disturbing, considering the film doesn't have much original to offer.  It's nice to see a film revolving around such a violent character, but the violence is grossly understated and rarely prominent (except for Gordon-Levitt's riveting first scene).  Hesher's potential violence pretty much remains potential, and the inevitable heartwarming end (yes, you knew it was coming, you know it from the second or third scene) undermines any promise the film truly had.<br /><br />Then why three stars?  Because of the performances.  Gordon-Levitt is reliable as always; in his best scenes, he sinks his teeth into Hesher and lets 'er rip.  Brochu does the brooding child thing well, with a delightful hint of menace and vulnerability thrown in for good measure.  Wilson is superb as the father, and Portmant is a little too sexy for her role (we're supposed to believe no one cares about a girl who looks like that?  Really?) but, as always, she makes the best of what she's given.  More kudos go to the always-great Piper Laurie, and John Carroll Lynch (grossly under-used, as always).<br /><br />Ultimately, HESHER is a bit of a let-down.  It doesn't know what it wants to be: bada** flick about conflicted relationships and coping with loss, or feel-good drama with a little dirt rubbed in.  Ultimately, the dirt doesn't break the surface, and HESHER remains little more than a promise unfulfilled.  But see it for the performances, especially the scene between Laurie and Gordon-Levitt--two of the best actors of their respective generations, sharing an intimate moment and playing their talents off one another.  It doesn't get more entertaining than that; too bad the rest of the film doesn't equal that level of greatness (though, in a few keys moments, it comes pretty close).her.  It doesn't get more entertaining than that; too bad the rest of the film doesn't equal that level of greatness (though, in a few keys moments, it comes pretty close).

B003L77GRO|2.0|I'd just finished watching the UK release of Dexter season 4, and got this version of season 5, and while the show is great, the mastering of the DVDs seems to have been done by monkeys.    Play all is randomly on some discs, but not others, and the chapterization is garbage. I want chapter skip to take me to the start of the episode, just after the titles, but no, this one is either the start of the titles, or some point inside the epsiode.    How difficult can this be? It's not brain surgery, people!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is the opposite of what I was expecting. It's big, it's heavy, and it has the most steel out of any of the knives I own. I expected a shorter, slimmer fighter like the mil-issue combats from Ka-Bar, only wider. I took this on a 3 mile up and down today and it performed well. The weight lets it function more like a small hatchet than a typical drop point or field knife. The sheath held up well upside down and under stress, and it's bite on the hilt is so strong that my wife can't even draw it. It made short work of two branches and without getting my mora out I had 2 walking sticks.    My only complaint was that it was shipped with no paperwork, packing material, and the paint on the button was worn off by this shipping treatment.     If you are buying this as a fixed blade supplement to a hatchet/machete remember it is HEAVY and does not wield like a fighter. Your wife or kids will hand this back to you and demand their gerbers back, like mine did. You can't use this knife like a seal pup or sog fighters. But what you CAN do is have a heavy, all around tool that has taken the place of a foldout shovel, seal pup, and hatchet in my packs.    Again, not what I was expecting, but what I got replaced $200 of equipment and has a permanent home in my pack.

She is a year old now and this is the first book she gets off her book shelf every morning! It is fun, great pictures, and all about animal sounds. For her first birthday I just ordered 5 more Sandra Boynton books and hopes she loves them as much as this one!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|We bought this instead of the $30 Baby Jogger brand for our City Mini stroller.  So glad we saved the money and went with this one instead.

B004VFYOA2|2.0|The problem with this video was it was shot for the concert screen so the fans far from the stage could see somthing. This video was never intended to be seen on your tv screen! Now if you are a Whitsnake fan i am sure you will like it but be WARNED it looks very BOOTLEG. Again it was shot for the concert crowd not for reproduction to be seen on any TV screen.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|8 years is a long time for anyone to wait between albums releases but this made it all worthwhile.  Simply put, there ain't a duff track on here.  The classic grooves are in place, the drums kick, there's more hooks than you can count and honestly, I can't get over how vicious Joey Belladonna sounds.  Anthrax had a lot to prove with this one and boy did they ever.    Easily for me, metal album of the year so far.
0439023521|4.0|This was a terrifically exciting read.  Collins knows how to spin suspense into her unique and futuristic world.  The characters are a treat in their own and each chapter leaves you hanging on for more!  It is tough to put the book down once you have started.  Great for teens and grown-ups alike, I think anyone who picks up the book will find themselves engulfed in the Games.

B0058VA2U4|3.0|What got me into Anthrax years ago was no other than Joey Belladonna's vocals.To me he is one of the most talented singers of our time.I think what this album is missing is more joey.The way i look at it, this album was in the making since  bush and Dan were on vocals for the band.I know after Joey rejoined the band spent time re recording  but i don't think it was enough time for joey to add his signature vocal ranges that all his other albums have.Maybe its just me,am still listening to hundreds of bands from the 80's and refuse to listen to more melodic or progressive metal of this generation.I enjoy Listening to Anthrax but this album is not what i want to remember them by,am going back to among the living.

I'm a Prime member and chose the 2-day shipping but I got the tower the very next day. But my whole point of this review is to let any of you potential buyers out there that the reviewer that didn't receive his screws probably didn't know where to look.  It took me a few hours before i realized the are in a little black plastic box hidden as part of the case.  They are located on the front face of the tower way at the bottom, you have to take out 2 screws just to gain access to them.      If you decide to purchase this case you will not be disappointed.

B005974CNA|5.0|I had been a Dream Theater fan up until Six Degrees was released in January of 2002. That was the last release that I bought, so this one is almost a 10-year wait. I had my serious doubts about this one, especially with no sound clips (which is actually a good thing). After reading enough reviews here that proved that the Portnoy heavy-metal growl was gone, I took a chance and bought the special edition CD with no regrets. As for the music, it harkens back to the days prior to Six Degrees, with not one single second having me want to skip to the next track (hence the 5-star rating). I won't bore you with the details, since there are many other reviews that take care of this quite well. My days of super-analysis are long gone.<br /><br />As for the special edition, just spring for the bucks and get it. For anyone who bad mouths the new drummer, you all need to watch this DVD of drummer auditions first. This DVD also reveals Jordan to be the perfectionsist, John Myung to be the quiet one, James to be the opnen-minded one, and John Pertucci to be the even-keel peacenmaker in the family. And if any of you gripe over price, for goodness sakes, the entire special edition package costs less than a lap dance and you will get way more for your money.

B004I1AGTC|4.0|Donnie Yen again plays the legendary martial artist Ip Man in this followup to the original IP MAN. I haven't seen the original, so I have nothing to compare it to, which may or may not be a good thing in terms of a review, since my impressions are not preconceived.<br /><br />It is 1950. World War II is over. The Communists have seized mainland China. Ip Man and his family have fled to Hong Kong, where they are living a very hand-to-mouth existence as he tries to establish a school to teach Wing Chun.<br /><br />Hong Kong is rundown and economically depressed in these first years following the War, and few potential students can afford Ip's fees. In this dog-eat-dog environment, students are at first hostile and aggressive. Ip Man is forced to fight and best Wong Leung, a street tough who eventually becomes his famed successor. Leung brings many other students to Ip Man for training, and his school begins to flourish in a small way.<br /><br />This minor success draws the attention of Master Hung (Sammo Hong, the fight choreographer for the film) who demands that Ip Man be tested against other Masters before his school is recognized. After winning their respect, Ip Man is dismayed to discover that the entire exercise was a prelude to an extortion scheme. Refusing to pay, Ip Man soon finds his school closed down, but he continues to teach nonetheless. His moral stand shames Master Hung, who begins to befriend him.<br /><br />The film's centerpiece is a bloody, violent and murderous contest in the ring between a seemingly unbeatable Western boxer (Twister) and the Chinese Masters, at first Hung and then Ip. It was deeply disturbing to view the blatant racism of the British and the smoldering resentment of the Chinese.  How much of this is factual and how much fictional is hard to measure.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, Ip Man wins, delivering a very ROCKY IV-like closing speech. His resultant fame and honor bring success and more students to his door, including a very young Bruce Lee.<br /><br />The fight scenes are executed wonderfully, particularly a lengthy, complex battle inside Master Hung's fish market. Donnie Yen is excellent as the stoic, tough, but kindhearted Ip Man.<br /><br />If IP MAN 2 has a star-losing drawback, it is the fact that the film focuses much less on the moral and philosophical underpinnings of Ip Man's teachings and more on mindless street brawling. But Donnie Yen projects the kind of equanimity necessary for a Ch'an Master, giving us the strong message that martial arts are less martial and more of an art than the flying kicks and blindingly fast punches seen in this film would have us believe.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDre executed wonderfully, particularly a lengthy, complex battle inside Master Hung's fish market.

B004LWZVZC|5.0|If you are an American history bufff, especially of the Civil War & the Lincoln assasination like I am, you will love this movie.  I believe that Mary Surrat was guilty as sin, but I also believe that she got railroaded but you also have to remember the times.  I believe that this movie gives a pretty balanced portrayal of that.

B004UA8D1O|3.0|The story became better because of the 3D but there wasn't enough 3D. You can't compare this 3D with Avatar's because there really isn't that much. The story moves slowly and it's a predictable plot. I hope Cameron is working on more 3D movies that rival Avatar. He moved the bar high with Avatar and doesn't match it with Sanctum.
B002ZG9774|4.0|I agree that I don't understand the ratings this movie musical received!! Granted the acting is not superstatic and I have seen the story line in other forms, but Christina A. is beyond fantastic and amazing to watch - an absolutely thrilling performer!! I have watched it 7 times and only this week bought the CD.  My drive to and from work could be five times longer and I would not even notice.  :)))
1427214425|1.0|Dan Brown in my opinion is a one trick pony.<br /><br />1) Start a story with a murder<br />2) Give some character background<br />3) Set hero and co-hero on an adventure<br />4) Have strange murderer person/thing follow a hero one step behind during the entire story<br />5) End with hero evading murderer, plot twist being revealed, a couple of people dying, hero/heros re-united and romance complete<br /><br />This is the same thing that happens in this book.  It was very dissappointing because I knew exactly what would happen after the first few chapters.  I felt I didn't even need to hear the rest.  Dan Brown also makes some writing errors.  He has the bad guy as deaf but sometimes has the same bad guy hearing things.  He has the hero character enter a womens bathroom to use a urinal.. no they don't have urinals in women's batherooms.<br /><br />I had the audio book and the reader made all of these horrible character impressions.  But alas, once I decided this thing sucked I already invested my time and said to myself I would see it through.  Don't read or listen to this crap.  I would rather hear Lady Gaga for 8 hours straight.

B005974CNA|5.0|I've read multiple reviews of this album before listening and found none very helpful. Don't listen to these over analylitical people over state their disappointment. The only draw back to me, which doesn't really affect my opinion of sound; This album is a tad less drum driven, more instrument driven. What I expected because Mike Portnoy is a much better drummer in my opinion. Don't believe me? What has mangini done that can over shaddow what Portnoy has done? NOTHING! None the less, this album is great! Don't listen to what people say, just listen to the album and judge yourself.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I'll start by saying that I am an huge lady antebellum fan. so this CD would have had to be exceptionally bad for me to dislike it. i was nervous for the release.... their sophomore album wasn't nearly as good as their debut album. so album three seemed like a turning point. either they would continue the downward slide, or they would step it up and impress. i shouldn't have doubted them. THIS CD IS AMAZING. i usually need a couple times through a CD to warm up to it. i loved this one from the first listen and continue to love it more... favorite tracks:    heart of the world: \\"hold on to me, baby don't let go. i'll never not be your girl. 'cause love is the heart of the world\\" really sweet.     wanted you more: classic pity party track. this is the stuff i love lady a for. \\"...wasted too much time, should've seen the signs, now i know just what went wrong. guess i wanted you more...\\" pour yourself a glass of wine. pull out some old photos. you'll be feeling it.     as you turn away: \\"nothing more to say. nothing left to break. i keep reaching out to you, hoping you might stay. nothing more to give. nothing left to take. i keep reaching out to you, reaching out for you, as you turn away\\"    and even if the lyrics were awful (they're not), charles and hillary have such unique voices that sound amazing together. buy this album. do it now. you won't be disappointed.
B005FUTBV4|4.0|Red State has received more attention for the way director Kevin Smith controversially auctioned the film to himself at Sundance and then chose to distribute it, rather than the real novelty of the film; the fact that it's a horror film directed by Kevin Smith. At least, it's billed that way. Truth is, Red State may have elements of a horror film, but it also has the elements of an action film and the elements of a Kevin Smith film which makes it hard to confine it to one genre. This becomes a problem since the film never settles comfortably for a singular vision and all these elements don't mesh together well. It's imperfections as a film must be noted right away, but it remains a refreshing change of pace for Smith and shows that he does possess the capability to surprise people.    En route to his local high school, Travis (Michael Angarano) spots members of the Five Points Trinity Church protesting the funeral of a recently murdered, homosexual teenager. At school, even the teacher talks about the church and how the most ultra of the ultra-Conservatives have distanced themselves from the politics of Five Points Church. Travis and his friends Jared (Kyle Gallner) and Billy Ray (Nicholas Braun) have other things on their mind though. Jared has set up a meeting online with an older woman for all three of them. When they go to meet the woman, they are ambushed by Sarah Cooper (Melissa Leo) and the rest of the churchgoers. Brought to the church, the head pastor Abin Cooper (Michael Parks) takes center stage and reveals that the church is much more sinister than anybody believed.    The film begins like a typical modern horror movie. Teenagers, their heads full of the potential for sex, find themselves in a dangerous situation. Red State abruptly changes gears once its three principal characters are kidnapped and the remainder of the film is basically a standoff between the church compound and ATF Agents, unaware of the kidnapped teenagers inside. There are other familiar faces in the cast, including John Goodman and Kevin Pollak as two ATF agents and Stephen Root as the closeted local sheriff.     Smith's film is inspired by the Westboro Baptist Church and their leader Fred Phelps, the group that the Ku-Klux-Klan dismissed as too extreme in their intolerance. Smith has constructed the Five Points Church and its members from the WBC, but the Five Points Church is a cinematic hybrid of the WBC, the Branch Davidians, and the Manson Family. In watching Michael Parks play Abin Cooper, I'm quite sure he looked to the respective leaders of these groups/cults as there are visible aspects of Phelps, David Koresh, and Charles Manson in the performance. Phelps is the most obvious, but Parks is much more charismatic than that. Smith reveals his presence behind the camera when Abin Cooper enters the film and, with Jared trapped in a nearby cage, preaches to his congregation for nearly fifteen minutes about his extremist views. His dialogue isn't satirical either and besides the kidnapped teenagers on stage him with him, Cooper's preaching is actually less extreme than that of Fred Phelps' clan. I must emphasize again that Cooper preaches for nearly fifteen minutes. Red State is only 80 minutes. From his first scene to his final scene, Parks chews the scenery like gum without ever going over-the-top. A character actor, best known for playing a recurring police officer in several Quentin Tarantino films, he's able to really make an impression here. With his commanding performance at the center, he brings instant prestige to the film. Red State has been putting itself in place for Academy Award consideration. Say what you will about the film itself and Kevin Smith as a writer and director; Parks may have a real chance. It's a bravura performance, flamboyant and brilliant enough to consider Oscar-worthy. These are the best performances that Kevin Smith has ever seen to fruition. No one gives a weak performance and don't let the horror tag foolyou; this is a film driven by performances. Melissa Leo, an actress of unbridled talent, is extreme here but great as usual. John Goodman meanwhile is given a really meaty role, bringing unexpected depth to a film that doesn't require it.     There's not a frame of Red State that even remotely resembles anything that Smith has done before, but it's clearly his work. Billed as a horror film, the film is heavy on blood but light on both gore and actual horror. Unheard and unseen of in horror films of late, there's also a strong emphasis on character and dialogue. Red State is much closer in spirit to an exploitation film, as its subject matter is built on the foundation of the exploitation genre; taking a topical subject and exploiting it to extreme lengths. The latter half of the film is a large-scale stand-off sequence, complete with shoot-outs, moral dilemmas, and several onscreen deaths. Smith's forte is character and dialogue, but he's quite good with shoot-outs too. The laziness that marred the action sequences of Cop Out, his previous film, isn't present here. There was obviously more passion behind the camera as well as in the editing room.    Smith has publicly noted that he considers himself more of a writer than a director, yet ironically the biggest imperfections in Red State stem from the writing, with Smith never settling on a particular direction for his film. Smith has a gift for dialogue and it suits the film well here, but the dialogue between the teenaged characters in earlier scenes is heavy-handed; like it's trying to be vulgar, rather than letting vulgarity illustrate the mind-set of these characters. Smith has said that this would be a straight-forward horror film, with no comedy. Well, there is some comedy; there's just no toilet humor. The epilogue especially veers into comedy (of a satirical nature), but doesn't betray what came before it. Since he never settles specifically into the horror genre, the comedy keeps things interesting. One of the best moments in the film is also one of the funniest, with Smith delivering the film's final line off-screen. It's hilarious, but the symbolic nature of him delivering the line works on a much deeper level than just a director cameo pining for laughs.     There's a lack of direction, as Smith's horror film never allows itself to be categorized. It's not horrific enough to be horror, nor is there enough action for it to be an action film. Smith could have made an indictment of religious extremism in America, but chose not to. Perhaps Smith believed that showing the group, who don't do anything in the film that hasn't been perpetrated by real fundamentalists in the name of religion, speaks volumes by itself. While there are no profound statements made here about religion or anything else, Red State is not a failure and is an enjoyable film. It's well directed, with great performances and great dialogue; entertaining and much better than most of the crap that passes for horror/exploitation nowadays.     I admit that it's not the horror film that Smith promised, but it is better than most of the \\"horror\\" films audiences have been treated to in recent years. It also proves that Smith isn't the one-note director he's been accused of being. Red State is not a great film, it's not perfect, and I could make suggestions on what could have been improved, but Smith needs to be given credit for making a dark, fun movie. It lacks a profound or even profoundly satirical look at the fundamentalists he's going after, but Smith's final line sums everything up perfectly. When it comes to dealing with religious extremists of this sort, it's really the only thing you can say.     GRADE: B

B000PMLFRA|1.0|As others have said, Amazon has merged the reviews with the 2006 dvds, so don't be fooled by the positive revews.    This release is plagued with a host of technical problems, and ever more dire, with needless and laughable revisions.  It's bad enough that the blacks are crushed, the lightsabers haven't been fixed (save for maybe 2 shots), audio errors from the 2004 set remain, there are weird color casts, etc, but adding insult to injury by adding the NNOOOOOOOOO!!!, obi's howl, and adding all of the other pointless revisions shows a stunning level of mistreatment for some of the most important films in cinema history.  With a fraction of the money used to revisit and change the films they could have been *easily* restored the theatrical versions as well, and released them along side this one.  This release should have been more, the films deserve it.
0385534639|5.0|\\"The circus arrives without warning.\\" (This may be the most talked about opening line of any book to be published this year.)<br /><br />The book this opening statement comes from is called The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern and one that amazed me in so many ways. All my emotions were engaged as I read. I was enthralled to the point I wanted to curse Erin because I was utterly obsessed with this fantasy world she has created. Words are poetry where the writer is the artist responsible in creating beauty in every line. Erin Morgenstern has done that here and more so with The Night Circus. It's a ballet on the pages, an intricate spellbinding tale that will leave you breathless as two people, by no choice of their own, are victims of a game set out by two devious individuals. The prize is not certain or guaranteed. What is certain is there can only be one winner, one left standing, while the other wastes away, overcome with madness for the deceit and manipulation that rules their life until they can't take it anymore and destroy themselves.<br /><br />The Night Circus is told in first person present tense starting in the year 1873. We meet Hector Bowen, a showman and a magician known to the public as Prospero the Enchanter. One day he is sent a shocking gift- a five year old daughter, Celia, he never knew about. Celia's mother has killed herself and now Hector is forced to become Celia's caregiver. At first he has disdain for Celia, but he soon finds out how special and unique she is. He decides he wants to play a game, a competition. The man in the grey suit, sometimes called Alexander, has also played this game before. He and Hector make some sort of bet. Celia will be involved. Alexander must find her competitor. He decides on an orphan boy named Marco. For years Hector and Alexander teach and test their wards to build up their abilities. As the years go by, Celia and Marco's lives will become intertwined.<br /><br />When Marco grows into adulthood he meets a young woman, Isobel who can read tarot cards and begins a romance with her that may help him win the game. He becomes a personal assistant to Chandresh, who is indirectly involved in helping start a circus that will only run from sunset to sunrise, known better as the night circus. And then Celia joins the night circus as an illusionist, much like her father once was, but one with so much more talent. And when Celia and Marco finally meet, it's as if they're two sides of a coin, each other's sun and moon. But they both know that they must play the game until it's finished and only one of them can be the winner, while the loser will give up everything.<br /><br />The Night Circus spans thirty years, going back and forth between years as we see Celia and Marco build their craft, as well as pull in those around them who are unwittingly forced to participate in the game. The main question is, who's pulling the strings, manipulating the events involved? A higher power? Hector and Alexander? What if I told you no one? Everything that happens is a game of chance, a series of events that are like dominoes falling to one another. We follow Celia and Marco as they try to figure out their destinies. These two are just as sly and cunning as their \\"makers\\", but refuse to be pawns. Celia and Marco are unwilling participants who want to escape from the invisible chains binding them, but stay connected to each other. You'll be on the edge of your seat rooting for these two to find a way out.<br /><br />The secondary characters are so very rich and flavorful. We have the wonder twins, Widget and Poppet, who are as important to the night circus as Celia and Marco is. There's Bailey, a seemingly average teenage boy who is just as significant. Tsukiko, the circus's contortionist, is the voice of reason. Everyone here has a specific role, including the ones I haven't mentioned, but they don't know what it is or what the finale will be when all is said and done.<br /><br />The Night Circusis a cross genre fan's delight. This will appeal not only to the YA crowd, but the romance reader and the literary fiction lover. It's a supernatural, fantasy extravaganza that had me wanting more. When I read the final page, I hugged the book close. Erin has truly written a masterful tale that may span generation of readers.<br /><br />This was almost a perfect read for me, but one thing I felt cheapened Celia and Marco's feelings for one another is the Tsukiko's explanation on why this duo are so connected to one another and have developed a deep abiding love that transcends the stars. In a way, it seems as if the game has manipulated their feelings as well, which I find to be sad. I would like to think Celia and Marco's love is the real deal.<br /><br />This is one a smart read where you have to concentrate and be aware of every move and action, much like a chess game. And when all is said and done, you'll want to be a part of the night circus and never leave. Erin makes sure to pull readers in and not let go, just like the characters who have live and breathe the night circus and have become its soul.<br /><br />The Night Circus is a magical, dazzling book filled with such heartbreaking and bittersweet angst that almost bought me to tears. If there is one book you read this year, you must read The Night Circus. I want to have babies with this book and cradle it in my arms.<br /><br />Thank you Erin, for writing what I believe will someday be called a masterpiece. Bravo!<br /><br />Katiebabsnot only to the YA crowd, but the romance reader and the literary fiction lover. It's a supernatural, fantasy extravaganza that had me wanting more.

This is one a smart read where you have to concentrate and be aware of every move and action, much like a chess game. And when all is said and done, you'll want to be a part of the night circus and never leave. Erin makes sure to pull readers in and not let go, just like the characters who have live and breathe the night circus and have become its soul.    The Night Circus is a magical, dazzling book filled with such heartbreaking and bittersweet angst that almost bought me to tears. If there is one book you read this year, you must read The Night Circus. I want to have babies with this book and cradle it in my arms.    Thank you Erin, for writing what I believe will someday be called a masterpiece. Bravo!    Katiebabs

B004KSQN7C|5.0|For all of the troubles she faced having to grow up and deconstruct in public, she continues to put out first rate pop and dance music. This disc is certainly darker than her last 2 offerings, but it is mature (in a good way), and thrilling.
B005IZLPMY|1.0|I don't see why this would get better reviews than lets say the green lantern. I usually like long movies with a lot of story in them but this one just bored me the whole way through. There wasn't enough suspense or enough action to make it a thrilling or even a half way good film. I'm glad I only paid four bucks to see it because I won't be buying it at all. Chris Evans was definitely not the right choice for Captain America, he just didn't make it believable for me.
B005974CNA|5.0|I wasn't blown away after my first listen of Dream Theater's A Dramatic Turn of Events, but that all changed on my second spin. This is one of the few DT albums that has no below average songs on it. Sure the three ballads might get a little boring after repeat listens, but the other six songs are all way above average, with On the Backs of Angels, Lost No Forgotten, Bridges in the Sky, Outcry and Breaking All Illusions reminding me why I have been a fan since I first heard Scenes From a Memory back in 1999. Build Me Up, Break Me Down is okay, but it's the weakest of the heavier songs.<br /><br />James Labrie sounds better than the last few albums, John Petrucci remains the guitar God with his inventive riffing and amazingly technical solos, John Myung stays consistently strong on bass, Jordan Rudess, the virtuoso keyboardist, probably has more impact on these songs than ever before (love it or hate it), and Mike Portnoy's replacement Mike Mangini does a tremendous job on drums, especially considering most or all of the material was written before he joined the band. He may even be a better drummer technically speaking, but I would like the next album to feature a bit more of the originality that Portnoy brought. The mixing of the drums could also have been more up front instead of overwhelmed at times by the guitar and keyboard volume.<br /><br />A Dramatic Turn of Events is a major step in the right direction for the pound for pound most talented band on the planet. I have a feeling that I will just like it more and more with each listen.

B004EPZ0A2|4.0|Think of Contagion as a more realistic version of Outbreak. A deadly virus is spreading around the world at an alarming rate and the CDC works to find out where it originated from and of course, a cure. The cast is packed full of stars, minus the heavy make-up and great lighting in order to resemble us normal people I guess. This is truly an ensemble piece with Matt Damon, Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Laurence Fishburne having the most screen time. There is no real lead performance, which can be a bit jarring for some. There is a whole lot more talk than action, which may bore some, but I found it intriguing.<br /><br />The movie hits hardly any wrong notes and it might make you think twice before touching anything in public or leaving the house for that matter.
0802136834|5.0|I doubt that I will ever become a serious historian. However, in the last few years, I have read several of Philippa Gregory's novels of the Tudor period.  They were enjoyable, but I ordered Alison Weir's book to get a more complete and factual picture of the times, and was not disappointed.  The gradual deterioration of Henry's physical and mental states is well-chronicled, as are the lives of the six women who had the bad fortune to be married to him.  I especially enjoyed the \\"background\\" chapters, which gave valuable insights into the Catholic Church and the English culture of the time.  I hope to be reading more of Ms. Weir's works in the near future.
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|The Debt is a well crafted and acted thriller that takes place in 1966 and 1997. It is about three Israeli spies whose mission it was to capture and bring to trial a former Nazi \\"surgeon\\" who experimented and killed countless people. It jumps back and forth, but it spends about 70% of the time in 1966. There is also a nice mystery element that challenges what came before. Jessica Chastain as the younger version of Helen Mirren was the standout in a cast without a weak link. Even Sam Worthington shows more of a range than I thought he was capable of and Jesper Christensen as the Nazi surgeon was almost Hannibal Lector like.<br /><br />This is a solid future rental choice for your queue.
B004LWZW42|3.0|Overall, I've enjoyed all the X-Men movies, truth be told. Doesn't matter who's directed what. That's not to say that every one has been the best comic book movie ever but, for the most part, I've enjoyed them. X-Men: First Class was a pleasant surprise to me in that it tells how the X-Men came to be. While the acting was pretty good and the CGI scenes were top-notch, something about this installment felt weak to me. It could've been the fact the story was set during the Cold War era or the fact that all the characters(save for Professor X, Magneto, Wolverine, Mystique and Beast) were new to me, moviewise. At any rate, it just felt that way with me. For that reason, alone, is why I gave the movie three stars.<br /><br />Would I consider it to be 2011's Summer Blockbuster? No. For what it is, X-Men: First Class is a competent comic-book movie that will provide plenty of entertainment to those who watch it, and provide enough for X-Men fans to appease.<br /><br />Given talk that First Class is the first film in a trilogy of new movies, the powers that be(namely Matthew Vaughn) have plenty of time to get things right so I won't complain too bad. I did purchase this movie for my collection of comic-book movies.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|Great game except the controls flakes out and you have to reposition ur thumbs to make ur character move again.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've had this set on pre-order since the day it was announced. I've even scheduled work (this weekend) around being able to watch all my favorite Start Wars movies in awesome Blu Ray!!<br /><br />Imagine my dissapointment when I read this box set is NOT a clear, crisp, awesome sounding copy of the original movies I loved as a kid!! I'll never forget going to see my first Star Wars movie - West Orange, Connecticut: I was a sophmore in high school - and that's the version of the movie I'm looking for!!<br /><br />Sure there are a couple of obvious \\"flubs\\" in some of the movies, but that's part of what makes those movies special! All I wanted was an awesome sounding, awesome looking print of the original movie. Apparently that is NOT whats in this box set.<br /><br />I'm cancelling my pre-order. Lucasfilms stops changing the movies I love.

0451450523|5.0|Perhaps the best thing about this book is that all the characters, including the Unicorn, are far from perfect and will do and say things that will annoy you to no end. But they are also all sympathetic and loveable in their own ways.     The way in which Beagle mixes the cruel reality of life with the characters' quest for a fairytale ending is not to be missed.
B004SHED22|2.0|The book starts off with two story lines and alternates between the two every chapter. At one corner you get to read about the tale of a little girl whose life got turned completely upside down in a matter of days during the month of July of 1942. Being a Jew, her family was part of the roundup event that the French government ordered about. Many of them were born in Paris and initially, they thought being rounded up by their own French policemen was just a mistake and that everything would soon return back to normal. Of course, they couldn't be more wrong. In the other corner, you've got an American woman by the name of Julia Jarmond living in modern day Paris (author did not mention specific timeline till way later). Julia and her husband is about to move in to an apartment that once belonged to his grandmother. Julia then finds out that her house has deep connections to the past and goes hunting for the truth.<br /><br />First off, I think the writing is pretty horrible in Sarah's Key. Character development is weak and many of the pieces were predictable. I might have forgiven the author for this if only she focused more on Sarah's life towards the second half of the book but she didn't, so she's not forgiven! The first half of the book really caught my attention and that was mainly due to reading chapters about Sarah. For chapters with Julia and her husband in it, not so much. It was a drag and bore. Once the author completely abandons Sarah's life and focuses instead entirely on Julia in the second half, all hell broke loose. I almost found myself not being able to continue on. It was just that bad. So many filler pieces and pages were wasted on focusing on the problems with Julia and her husband. I skipped so many useless excerpts in the second half of the book and continued only when there was actual communication between characters.<br /><br />There really isn't that much good things to say about this book. The writing is extremely simple, most of the characters were dull and bland, Julia's hesitancy to do things gets annoying very quickly, and the pace is very slow. Another thing that quite irritated me was the many questions being asked by the character to themselves. What's going to happen next? Where are they taking them? Am I going to be safe? How can I live any longer? Why is this happening? You see, the questioning one-self tactic is used to convey doubt and highlights the reality of the situation the character is in. However, that doesn't mean the author should use it every other chapter!<br /><br />The one good thing I can honestly say about Sarah's Key is bringing my attention to the Vel' d'Hiv event. If not for this book, I would have continued putting all the blame on Hitler and his government for the extermination of the Jewish people. If you want to learn about this historical event itself, Sarah's Key is not for you. It should get you interested enough though for you to go out on your own to learn more.nd bland, Julia's hesitancy to do things gets annoying very quickly, and the pace is very slow.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why make any changes? I really wanted to see these on Blu-ray but decided against buying them. I feel like it isn't worth the money especially after the \\"NOOO\\" addition. I ask myself, how many times do I really need to buy these movies? Especially when it seems like the fans aren't really appreciated. I feel like 'They' are wondering how many times will the fans buy these movies if we just change one little thing each time it is released. Pure marketing...which isn't a bad thing, just not interested this time.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|[[ASIN:B004LWZW4C X-Men: First Class (+Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]] I wish I could say that this is a great movie.  However, Fox dropped the ball in manufacturing this Blu-ray disc.  Yes the picture and sound are great.  If only the picture didn't freeze every 10 seconds or so as the sound keeps going only to have the video playing catchup.  At first I thought I needed a PS3 Firmware update, but according to Sony, I was already up to date. I tried other blurays in my player with no problem, so I thought maybe I had a bad disc.  After exchanging it for another at BestBuy (Thanks to the guy at the counter for hooking me up even though it was against policy) I brought the new disc home only to be frustrated again.  I've looked online for answers and apparently I'm not the only one with this issues.  Fox needs to release a statement as to what they're going to do to fix this situation.  Very Disappointed!! If anyone else has these problems or has heard from Fox, please leave a comment.

As I was trying to remove the red foil from the book the foil pealed the page of the book where the access code was, removing the access code.  I was being as careful as one could not to rip the page, but the access code came off with the foil.  Now I cannot read the access code.  The way this product was designed is very cheap.  Now I have to buy a new book or access code because the company can't design a scratch off???  I guess the design is not part of the editors strengths.
B003L77GRY|4.0|First off, I waited a looooong time to watch this season, and so had high hopes for it.. After watching Season 4, you expect a lot right?

159102594X|4.0|A good book, not one that I think will change fantasy as we know of. It's no Name of the Wind, The Hobbit, or The Game of Thrown. Yet only a few books are. Over all it was fun to read. I enjoyed the book and it's characters. Yes so were whining. Some were unlikeable, but I think that was the intent of the writer and there for I liked it. I would recommend it to fantasy fans.

B005974CNA|4.0|First of all, I really like this album. I enjoyed listing to it the first time through and so far each time since. I think that the reason for this is that I feel like I've heard it before. It is a very safe album as far as not challenging new horizons for the band or the Dream Theater formula and distinctive sound. The new drummer Mike Mangini is a great drummer, but I can't help but think he is doing his best Mike Portnoy impression instead of giving the songs his \\"touch\\". I think we will hear that on future releases. Mike Portnoy showed that he is more than just a competent drummer, he added so much to the previous releases. What an exceptionally talented musician and creative drummer he is.     I must say I am a little disappointed in the poor sound quality and mix. The drums just don't have the punch they should and the over all sound is a little muddy.    So again, all negative comments aside, this is a very solid effort and a joy to listen to if you like Dream Theater (which I do) and I recommend it...enjoy! Can't wait for more....
0307887898|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone interested in building a sustainable business in the 21st century.  I know that this is a bold statement but I fear the words \\"startup\\" and \\"entrepreneur\\"  will put off those who don't label themselves as entrepreneurs or think of themselves as working in a startup.      The Lean Startup is a field guide for businesses that need to navigate \\"under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\\"     This increasingly describes the challenges facing large, established organizations that operate in complex, rapidly changing markets, with competitors that can come out of nowhere.  In the face of such uncertainty you are essentially working in startup conditions where the winners are those who can build adaptive organizations that learn faster.  Taken in this light, anyone managing a business must have an entrepreneur's mindset and learn the science of innovation.  This is where The Lean Startup comes in...    Rather than take the theoretical approach of, say, The Fifth Discipline,  Ries has put together a methodical book full of practical ways to embed validated learning and scientific rigor into product and service development.  Of particular value for me was the concept of the MVP - minimum viable product -  that allows you to reframe your product in its most essential (and testable) form and how to establish metrics that matter (no more \\"vanity metrics\\"!).    I highly recommend this book.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|First time I saw this movie I just didn't get it. First and foremost there was no big environmentalist point. What?! Why was I even bothering--I needed my awareness raised for the fiftieth time this year! It also wasn't anti-corporate, anti-military, anti-progress, anti-Imperialist, anti-American, anti-religion, anti-capitalist, anti-police, anti-redneck, anti-gun, anti-authority, etc. etc. I mean c'mon, this is modern science fiction, right? What's modern science fiction without simpleminded demonizations, caricatures, stereotypes, pretentiousness, and flogging away pointlessly at the same trite social and political points that have dominated science fiction since the 1970s? How could a filmmaker even get funding for a project that didn't touch on these subjects?! The money and marketing people must have lost their minds!     Well, maybe there was a dollop of religious fanaticism but it wasn't presented in such a way that I could relate it unthinkingly to my immediate socio-political-economic concerns. The film didn't specifically reference the Westboro Baptist Church or the Religious Right. In fact it was almost more a commentary on the sort of insanity that gets in the way of people trying to accomplish a necessary and straightforward task. Here are \\"medics\\" trying to save a \\"patient\\" under intense conditions and (sorry if this is a spoiler) this brain-addled kook turns up with an agenda that is completely detached from reality. Very human and stressed troubleshooters try to save the world with what they've got, making hard decisions and mistakes--pure survival--and someone jumps in with wacky philosophy, mucking everything up, getting all upset because shoes are made of leather, or someone said 'girl' instead of 'woman,' or the chicken for dinner wasn't free-range, or the whole mission to save the world was made impure because it financed by corporations or used non-renewable resources.    So, instead, Sunshine was kind of an allegory about humanness and madnessand other classic universals; a fairy tale that addressed deeper concerns about who we are and where we really mess up? I tend to think so. Mistakes are made, prices are paid, but the protagonists keep slogging along, battling their own tendencies to get distracted, directly facing a greater insanity, a perfect metaphor for chaos: their target, the sun. Yet it doesn't get *really* awful for them until some other character--a character who probably would have loved Avatar--turns up and tries to derail their efforts because he has \\"profound\\" and utterly irrelevant bees buzzing in his bonnet.    Sunshine is visually stunning and flawless; and the the cast and script are first rate, but it doesn't surprise me that a lot of people didn't get this film. Much of the audience probably could identify more easily with the villain. The film's intelligence must have been as objectionable to them as it was a baffling surprise to me. Seems to me Sunshine is the exact opposite of Avatar.    This film will have its day.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|If you want all pre Christian Bale Batman movies on 1 DVD, this is the set for everyone to buy.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|I agree with another reviewer that this immediately reminds me a lot of Claypool's solo outtings. Right off the bat, Hennepin Crawler has a very Oysterhead feel.   Not that this is a bad thing, of course.      Overall, this is a lot more \\"prog\\" than I've heard from previous albums.    Epics like \\"Last Salmon Man\\" and \\"Jilly's on Smack\\" are longer songs with really awesome shows from Ler to Claypool's \\"underwater\\" sounding bass break down in \\"Jilly\\" .    Though you still have your toe tapping classic Primus moments with \\"Tragedy's A Comin\\" and \\"Extinction Burst\\".   Primus really covers the gamut along with some shorter, fun songs as they've usually given us with each album.    One of the biggest changes that personally threw me for a loop was Les Claypool switching up his usually whimsical narratives  for more social commentary (Moron TV, Eyes of the Squirrel , Eternal Consumption Engine).   Not that these are bad songs.  Far from it.  It's just kind of out of left field from  Les, who even in his darker writings, would still manage to keep a light-hearted air about his music.    It's a minor thing that honestly shouldn't deter any fan from giving this album a try.    The musicianship is still top notch as anyone should expect from Primus.     Jay Lane's return to the drummer's seat is superb.   \\"Extinction Burst\\" is a great example of Jay's percussive work that weaves seamlessly into very catchy funk grooves.    I recommend this one for any Primus fan.
B005F9CPG8|3.0|This is a great entry for anyone who hasn't bought a Beatles album yet-which very few of you haven't unless you're a child. My only complaint with this rerelease is they use the exact same remasters from 2009. And how is that a bad thing? Three tracks, in particular, stand out with issues as they did on those remastered albums. The tracks \\"From Me To You\\", \\"She Loves You\\" both have audible tape deterioration during their first few seconds. Compare the '09 remasters to your '87 releases and even the original release of Beatles 1 from 2000 and you`ll see what I mean. The most noticeable is \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". The opening line \\"It's been a hard day's night...\\" even has tape drop off in the left channel. Listen to Ringo's cymbals, how they start off very muffled, then slowly become clearer. This never happened in any other stereo CD releases. More of a reason I only wish Apple went back to the original session tapes rather than the final master tapes which are often 2nd, 3rd and even 4th generations old. Still, if you have not bought any Beatles music yet, this album is a great introductory with 27 of the best singles ever released. But if you're willing to spend a little more cash on the greatest band of the 20th century, consider the two double disc sets 1962-1966 and 1967-1970.

0385534639|4.0|I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher.<br /><br />I am a fan of magical realism and whimsy.  I'll take it in any form I can find it.  When I started hearing the buzz about Erin Morgenstern's NIGHT CIRCUS, I knew I had to get my hands on a copy.  While the book may not fall directly into the magical realist category, it IS filled with lots of magic and beauty.<br /><br />A mystery circus rolls into town that is only open at night.  Everything about the circus from its costumes to its tents are black and white.  Instead of entering one large tent and viewing a standard three-ring show, visitors are encouraged to wander through many small tents in order to explore the many wonders the circus has to offer. The visitors, however, are not aware of the true purpose of this wonderful attraction.  The circus is actually a traveling venue for a magical competition between two powerful magicians who were designated opponents when they were children.  Celia is the daughter of a well-known magician and Marco is an orphan taken in by a mysterious man in grey.  Both children have been trained since childhood for the express purpose of engaging in this mysterious and fierce competition.  As the game continues over the years, Celia and Marco fall in love and their forbidden relationship has dangerous consequences both for themselves and the Circus.<br /><br />To me, the love story and competition were the least interesting parts of the book.  I was most intrigued by the marvelous details about the Circus itself.  It seemed like such a wonderful place and, as each tent is revealed, I became more and more drawn into its magic.  Morgenstern is marvelously creative in crafting this circus and its many wonders.  It is filled with such beauty and wonder and the people in and around it are as intriguing as its offerings.  When the story returned to Celia and Marco, I often became bored and impatient.  While their story is important in terms of moving the action along, I was far more interested in the day-to-day operations of the Circus.  I was excited to see what new wonders each chapter would reveal.<br /><br />I didn't really believe in Marco and Celia's love and I found the competition a bit confusing.  I wish Morgenstern had gone into greater detail about the reasons behind the competition and the mysterious men behind it.  However, the details about the circus redeemed the whole story for me.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Recommended.

1609611543|5.0|I have been low carbing for a while and thought that I was doing the right thing by keeping away from all the \\"bad stuff\\". Even though I was doing all of the right things, I did work whole grains into my plan because \\"they are so good for us and nutritionally beneficial\\". I thought I was eating as they did in ancient times--whole grains, fermented dairy products, lots of fruits and veggies, good fats and of course good quality protein.  I never imagined that the foods from the past are not the foods we are consuming in the present.    I love Dr. Davis' easy style and I might add, his bravery.  It's not easy to speak out against the cherished grains--especially when the whole world seems to be going vegetarian.    This book might be the missing link that low carbers have been waiting for.  We all know that fructose in all its forms is the enemy, but wheat is actually a wolf in sheeps clothing.    I think everyone should read this book.  You may not need the information today, but you will tomorrow as we continue to modify our food to the point that our bodies no longer recognize it.
B005974CDU|2.0|This cd was not what I expected at all.  It seems like portnoy leaving put Rudess in the forefront for everything.  His stupid keyboard solos are everywhere and completely mixed over the top of everything else.  Petrucci is completely cut out of the mix most of the time and myung is barely audible for most of the cd.  I have always disliked lebri's voice with the exception of octavarium, and he is even more annoying on this cd than usual.  Slightly better than his overly synthed crap from black clouds and silver linings.  The drums were not nearly present enough overall.  If this cd had been mixed better i can see it being decent.  I always liked there longer pieces because they flowed nicely.  These songs are long but they just go from one rediculous keyboard solo to the next.  Big time dissapointment.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Where do I begin? I guess the best place is with the sound of the album. Recorded in Tom Scholz basement in 1976, this album still sounds better than most albums today almost 40 years later. Brad Delp is probably, along with Steve Perry from Journey, the top Hard Rock vocalist of all time. Oh Tom Scholz(lead guitar), and Barry Gourdeau(rhythm guitar, sometimes lead, notably on Hitch A Ride) are pretty good too. Their style is straight forward, in the vein of Guns N' Roses Slash, but still a standout from the rest of the offerings in the 1970's. The line up also included Fran Sheehan on bass(very talented) and Sib Hasian on drums, all band members are extremely talented and well-versed on thier insturments. More Than A Feeling is undoubtedly one of the best rock songs of all time. Peace Of Mind is right up there, along with Long Time and Something About You. How many people had thier first make out session to that song? If I were on a deserted island and I could take one album with me this would probably be the one. I have so many memories while listening to this album. If your a rock fan and don't own a copy, shame on you.
0452286751|4.0|This novel stands as a monument to human accomplishment. To each their own but in my opinion a better character has never been brought to life than the protagonist of the Fountainhead, one Howard Roark. Throughout the novel he attacks his goals with a doggedness that is found in only the most disciplined of persons. I could write a short story describing Roark and his personal qualities, however, In this review I would like to focus more heavily on the theme of the novel and Rand's unique philosophy. Suffice to say Howard Roark endures what would have broken ten lesser men and at the conclusion of the novel we find him literally standing on top of the world.<br /><br />As I am sure you know Rand's philosophy is Objectivism. I first fell in love with this unique philosophy around the age of 18 when I was finishing high school. I read the Fountainhead and believed that I had uncovered the solution to all of mankind's problems. Every page seemed to be a personal revelation that would better my life. I tend to be anti-social and individualistic by nature so needless to say I was instantly attracted to a main character who seems oblivious to the outside world and its influences.<br /><br />I am now nineteen and have spent a year in college. I have come to the conclusion that it SUCKS to be alone. It really sucks... Which is in essence what Objectivism preaches. Howard Roark seems to do it without effort in the book, but he is a fictional character and this is real life. I am trying to think of how to summarize the Fountainhead in a way that would make sense to a person who has not read it, however I am not that talented nor devoted to writing yet. Suffice to say if you followed its advice word for word one would be living in a very isolated world. I love being with people and often find the most happiness when I am with them. Think about a few of your most remembered moments in life and ask yourself if you were alone or with other people. That answer is easy for me.<br /><br />I guess what I am really trying to say is that this book lured me in with its idealistic promises but after voraciously reading and re-reading all of Rand's work and having some months to really think it over and apply it to my life, I would just as soon use it as kindling as anything else. With some 1000 reviews before me I doubt anyone will even read this, at least not for a while. I am ok with that because I am writing this review more for my purpose than any other, but there truly is some sense to what I have written.<br /><br />In closing, this book is wonderfully written, the main character Howard Roark is incredible, a shining example of human achievement, but keep my above mentioned thoughts in mind when and if you read this book. I believe that some aspects of Objectivism like judging people by the quality of their work are excellent concepts but as a whole, I would rather spend my time with imperfect people (LIKE ME, Nobodies perfect) than to live an isolated life striving for a perfect ideal.<br /><br />One final thought, if you REALLY still want to get a true grip of Rand's philosophy it is essential to read Atlas Shrugged. The Fountainhead is essentially just a broad outline of her philosophy while the voluminous Atlas Shrugged is the core document, ground zero if you will.<br /><br />Samam really trying to say is that this book lured me in with its idealistic promises but after voraciously reading and re-reading all of Rand's work and having some months to really think it over and apply it to my life, I would just as soon use it as kindling as anything else.

0439023521|5.0|I had heard of this book but was never really interested in it even though I knew absolutely nothing about the story.  I was browsing on Amazon and came across the book and was able to read a few pages from the book and was absolutely HOOKED!!!  I understand that it is written for young adults, however, it is a very compelling story and not entirely implausible at the rate our world is changing.  The Hunger Games themselves are reality television, gladiators and the Olympic games all rolled into one.  I've only read the first book and I can't wait to dive into books two and three.
B0000696ID|5.0|Of course ET is awesome, even after all this time!!! How can you go wrong with ET as a gift! It is one of the movies that you never get tired of seeing! I bought it for my daughters since they have never seen this inspiring, feel good movie!!!
1607886278|4.0|I wish I hadn't read the synopsis for this book before picking it up. It's impossible to talk about the book at all without giving a lot away, and I wonder how the first half would have read differently if I hadn't already known the premise.     It's not a very fast-moving book, but I found it engaging and insightful. The audio version is definitely the way to go if you can, and it's only four bucks on Audible.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I just want to say that this show is genius. Kind of a mix up between the wire and weeds but a little more dark. Definitely worth your time.
1427205264|5.0|Orson Scott Card says his books are meant to be heard more than read, and the cast of narrators for Ender's Game is phenomenal.     This book has been billed as YA and it does ok in that genre, but I find I get something more out of the book (the series, really), every time I listen. And Since I first \\"read\\" (listened to) this book in 2006, I get the urge to listen to it pretty much once or twice a year, despite the way my \\"to-read\\" list keeps growing.    Ender's Game is full of emotion, politics, children you tend to forget are so young, and the war of several lifetimes. And yet, that somehow doesn't begin to describe its depth and complexity. Just pick it up; you won't regret it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It's quite addictive though, I absolutely could not put it down till I'd beaten it. I had no issues what-so-ever and still enjoy playing it. Really amazing on the galaxy tab!!
0307454541|3.0|Part I of the book is AGONY; pure, unbridled agony. If you are a financier or something, you might not be totally bored by it, but for me, it was awful.<br /><br />By the time part II came along, though, the setup was FINALLY done and the actual story had started to move. While the first 150 pages took me WEEKS to wade through (I had to keep putting it down and read something more interested so my will to live wasn't completely sucked away), I cranked through the last 200 pages in one day.<br /><br />It is worth reading, if you can take some time and work your way through the beginning. I don't recommend reading it without an actually interesting book in tow to read when you just can't take it anymore. Unfortunately, part I is enormously critical to understanding what happens in Part II, so you really do have to read it and pay attention.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have the strength of will to get through part I, the book really ends up pretty interesting, and I'll probably read the sequels.

This program shows how and why so many people got sick from food poisoning, whether spinach, ground beef or turkey.  Frozen food from supermarket is no better with microwave solution.  It is frightening to learn that food inc. dominate and control the market and consumers left with less choice.

1593974760|5.0|Update: After my third (or was it fourth?) read/listen-through, I'm officially calling it - this is my favorite book.     But, if you can help it, don't think of this as the sequel to Ender's Game. Sure, there are a couple of the same characters, but it is really a completely different genre, and deserves to be considered in its own right.     The audiobook is wonderful. The voices are excellent and powerful.     I just really love this book. I enjoy the entire Ender series, as a whole, but I could read this book, on its own, again and again. I love the theology, philosophy, and human spirit in it. It moves me.     I'm pretty sure I would be a Speaker for the Dead, if I could. :)
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I used to like The X-Files very much. Fringe is ten times better. More interesting characters, Stories, Special effects, and more. There are great puzzles in the story lines that, unlike The X-files, are answered down the road. The level of mystery is excellent and the characters are very likeable. The unpredictability of the show is another bonus. I hope this show goes on for years and years and hopefully they will keep the same level of writing skill.
1423113454|4.0|I had high hopes for this book after reading the Percy Jackson series. I love mythology of all sorts, and the idea of a new series dealing with Egyptian mythology (Percy Jackson was Greek) was awesome.     I was not disappointed. After a quick and dirty start, the book lags a bit in the first couple chapters but picks up again before too long. I would have read it much more quickly if I wasn't swamped with summer school, and as it was, I often read when I should have been doing homework!     The characters are likeable and for teenagers, probably relatable. The story is told in the context of a transcribed audio tape (!), and the asides at the beginning of the chapters get tiring, but it's a minor nitpick.     There is a definite conclusion to this book, while still giving you a taste of the larger story arc that is to come - I like that. No real cliffhanger, but the promise of more.     I found myself often wondering how much of the story was made up and how much was based on true mythological scholarship. That's cleared up in the notes at the end, stating that the idea of Nomes, magicians, and so forth were really prevalent in Ancient Egypt, and the mythological aspect of the book is as true as one could expect.     These series' are great primers for mythological education. It's a fun and exciting way for kids to get their Mythological literacy on - just ask my six-year-old, who also adores it!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I had to add my voice to the chorus of those lamenting the fact that George Lucas feels the original, theatrical cuts should be forgotten and abandoned.  If you're going to release the Star Wars saga on Blu-ray, including the so-called 'improved, definitive' versions, at least be reasonable to the fans who've supported you over the years by including restored, cleaned-up versions of the original trilogy--the films that I grew up with--those ones that haven't been tampered with on numerous occasions.  This Blu-ray set is incomplete!
0345529057|5.0|The product was what I wanted at a good price.  But when I went to pay fo the item, I could not use my reward points.  The screen kept throwing me out, or would simply freeze.  I filed a complaint and was told that nothing could be done.  Therefore I think the reward points are a big scam.  Very disapointed, and will definitely limit future purchases to web sites that I trust to be fair.

0312600844|1.0|I couldn't waste my time finishing this book, even though I was trying to.    Sophomoric! Boring,self-absorbed characters who seem like they never got out of college.    When one thinks of all the books which are being published - which are about interesting people, surprising plots, fascinating places, amazing discoveries in science, etc., why bother?!    What was Oprah thinking?!!!
0785156593|3.0|Although I enjoyed Infinity Gauntlet, I was more than a little disappointed at its similarity to Dreadstorm and the Original Thanos Saga, as well as the subsequent Infinity War. All Starlin Thanos stories have the same characters and mostly doing the same thing. Here, Thanos is still pining for Death, and trying to destroy the Universe and Warlock is back to trying to stop him with the help of the Avengers and other Heroes. The Heroes all get zapped, but Thanos still loses. Most of the characters are completely irrelevant to the story and are just plot devices to be knocked down by Thanos. It's really really derivative of the earlier stuff. Worse, Thanos seems like a pathetic wuss when he is trying to impress Death, it seems to me that this relationship worked better in the original saga, but I may be remembering it better than it was. This story really did not hold up.

0984074422|5.0|My whole family just loves this book. Even my husband is always asking where the book is at so he can look at it. I don't regret buying this book one bit. Wonderful addition to use in homeschooling our children. We have the material world book by the same author as well. Love them both.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Best game ever!!! can play over and over even after finished. mini games are great too. my kids can't get enough too!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I have a 4 and 6 year old who thought this movie was kind of scary and did not make it to the end. That being said, my kids are pretty sheltered against violent movies and games and I knew there was a good chance that they would think that it is too scary...  My husband who is not a fan of special effects and action type movies found himself laughing and totally enjoying the movie.  That says a lot as he is really into more character based movies.  Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as the playboy turned super hero!  One of the best movies out of the Marvel franchise.  I loved Iron Man (1) and hoped that the sequel would be equally as good.  This may be a tad better than the first one!!
B000XR4OC0|1.0|I was really excited to buy my first pair of TOMS red canvas slip ons.  I loved the idea of providing a pair of shoes for a child in need.  The salesperson at Nordstrom told me to buy 1/2 size SMALLER than my regular size because they stretch out 1/2- a full size.  She said she has four pairs of Toms (canvas) and they stretched out an entire size.<br /><br />I took my 1/2 size smaller shoes home and thankfully, I only wore them inside the house.  They didn't provide good arch support and the soles were so slippery!  I almost fell while walking on our hardwood floors.  I'm a mom of a very active toddler.  I need shoes with good traction and I don't want to be nervous about something to basic and natural as walking.  I am returning them tomorrow.  I am really disappointed.  I was looking forward to wearing them, because they are so cute.  I agree w/other reviewers, it would be better to donate your $50 to another worthwhile charity than to buy a pair of TOMS.<br /><br />For a great flip flop, I highly recommend Montrails.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Musically, this is the greatest work that this band has ever done.  The drums, bass, guitars and vocals are just mind-numbing.  These guys have stepped way the hell over the line of great bands to best bands.  Great job guys!

B004WKOCP8|5.0|I am appalled to see people giving this album bad ratings because it 'wasn't what they expected' or '(insert band) cover band?'.  In that case, is an artist never allowed to experiment? Try something new? Seriously guys, it's ridiculous to say this album is a total failure.  Brandon's voice is still beautiful, the melodies are amazing and the work and effort they put into this album is as much as any other album.   Props to them for being genuine and writing music that THEY feel like writing. If artists all wrote what people wanted them to write, wouldn't music   lack creativity? All in all, this album is good, and though it may be different than the other albums, it's still incubus.    [..] for Brandon & Mike's take on 'If Not Now, When?'
B005H9B2CE|5.0|At first I was not sure what to expect.  My ten year old son wanted to watch it so I decided to cave in on a school night.  As it turned out I loved it!  It was the first movie I was able to watch with him where I was not having to tell him to plug his ears or close his eyes!  We both loved it!  Thought the ending was hosed up for the woman though!

B003UBTX72|5.0|Life by Keith Richards starts out like your typical Rock-n-Roll autobiography - getting stopped by the cops with a lot of drugs in the car, wondering if he and his friends are going to get busted.<br /><br />If that was what this entire book was about, it would be a total waste of time.  I mean, you can turn on TV and get the same thing for free.  But thankfully there is a lot more to his life and this book.<br /><br />The heart of this book is not the founding of, or his history with, The Rolling Stones. The heart of the book, and his life, is his love of music, and the joy it brings to him.  It is amazing to see how many different musicians have influenced him and just how many he has played with over the years.  It literally is a Who's Who of music, from Howlin' Wolf to Willie Nelson.  It is also about family, friends, some frank discussions on drugs, and life in general.<br /><br />Here is a *nugget from Keith, for you guitar players out there: Most of the Rolling Stones guitar parts are tuned to Open G - usually Banjo tuning.<br /><br />The way this book flows, it feels as if you aren't reading a book.  It feels more like sitting down with Richards and listening to him and his friends tell you the story as they go along; it has a stream of consciousness feel to it.  You are drawn in.  You come away feeling like you have known him for years.<br /><br />The major issue with this book is a minor one.  It has nothing to do with the language, well kind of.  I really wish the publisher would have put in a glossary of the British slang used in the book.  I was literally sitting near a computer as I read this book looking up different words and sayings, so I could understand what he meant.  One example is the word \\"pong.\\"  In America it is the name of a classic video game, but in Britain it means an unpleasant smell.<br /><br />When Keith and the Stones first came over to the States to tour, he noticed they were more accepted by Blacks than by Whites, who looked at them as completely alien.  Throughout his life, you notice how he is able to straddle both worlds, but at times feels more at home in the old juke joints.<br /><br />When Mick Jagger got knighted, Keith couldn't understand how Mick could sell out and accept an honor from the same people who tried to put them in jail.<br /><br />One of his well know nicknames \\"Keef,\\" we find out, didn't come from the fans but from his family - starting out as \\"Cousin Beef\\" and morphing to \\"Keef.\\"<br /><br />Among the quotes that stick out to me as being extremely insightful:<br /><br />\\"But leaving a newborn is something I can't forgive myself for.  It's as if I deserted my post.\\" Pg  385<br /><br />That was one of the most jarring quotes I came upon. It was about the death of his new born son, Tara.  He was away in Paris, on Tour with his older son Marlon, when he got the news that Tara died of Crib death.  That is one thing no father or mother ever wants to experience.  I can't imagine the hell he went through, after that.<br /><br />As men, we are called to look after our families, and Keith was out working to provide for his family, when Tara died.  We are called to man our posts and to never forsake or abandon them.  I don't think Keith did, but I totally understand why he feels that way.<br /><br />Life by Keith Richards reminds us that life is never as cut and dry as we sometimes make it out to be.

B003UESJH4|5.0|This review contains a moral: firstly DO buy this excellent, well-constructed film, as much for Helena Bonham Carter's SUPERB acting, as Colin Firth's.    BUT, don't go and buy Firth's ' A Single Man' on the strength of this one.     He made it in just 21 days, it was directed by a novice director who is a designer of handbags and perfumes, and bears no resemblance to the book it is 'based on'. it is DULL.    The moral is ignore the synopsis of films and look at the 'like' numbers:     'A Single Man' has just THIRTY FOUR 'Likes' on the Amazon system, look at the number of 'likes' A King's Speech' has above !

I admit there are some good scenes and enjoyable parts of the movies... and Revenge of The Sith is the best one of them all.  Still not enough for me to buy this set.

For now that is what I will be watching.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Having finished watching all these in a movie marathon at my friends house, I can safely recommend that no one buy this set.  At least not until it's being offered at fire basement sale prices.  Episodes I-III are episodes I-III.  You already know how you feel about them.  Episodes IV-VI are of course the altered versions.  Some changes merely annoy, some are passable, and some outright insult the audience.  Even if you don't mind the changes you still shouldn't buy the set because it claims to be the \\"complete saga\\" and yet I can't consider it complete without including the theatrical releases.  The extra's are pretty interesting and there is some stuff we haven't seen before, but it's not worth $80 bucks.  Wait for Lucas to release the theatrical releases too.  He inevitably will.
0307887898|5.0|Don't let the hype and enthusiasm from techies and engineers scare you; this book is for everyone.  With an accessible and clear style, it has something for engineers and general managers, startup founders and corporate managers alike.    Ries offers a detailed methodology for managing the growth of a startup, any startup. This book is for anyone who owns a business, works in a business, is thinking of starting a business or wonders why their business failed.  I'd be surprised if this book doesn't awaken those people working at startups in \\"stealth mode\\" and convince them to go out and talk to customers, measure, iterate, and pivot before it is too late.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Do not by this set.  I've watched them all and they are not worth it.  Lucas is deliberately milking the fans for all they are worth by not including the original theatrical cuts in this release.  He wants you to buy these special editions and then buy the original releases again when he releases them next time.  Don't encourage this kind of nonsense.  Almost all of the changes are bad, unnecessary, and a few are downright insulting to the audience.  Wait for the theatrical releases because they will be released eventually.  Do not waste money on these.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|Without going through a track-by-track review or anything like that, let me just say that this CD is the perfect follow up to \\"We've Come For You All\\" AND \\"Persistence Of Time\\" at the same time. The guys got it exactly right as a convergence point of the two eras of Anthrax. Joey's voice has matured immensely and it now strikes a great balance between the old days & the Bush years - though, he and John remain at opposite ends of the spectrum vocally. It's old and new school at the same time. This is just amazing. I will always respect Anthrax for acknowledging their roots, but continuing to grow ... and after following the band since sometime in the 80's, without missing a beat ... this is the perfect progression for the band. Major kudos. Worship Music is well worth your hard earned cash.

No need to review the songs individually; you can hear samples of them. So overall...    If you aren't a brown-noser who insists all of his material is great, then a few songs may appeal to you on this release. As haunting as Mockingbird, Space Bound is real the gem worth having. This LP is just a repeat though. Em's still rapping about Kim, killing, talking about trust issues, and rapping about Kim and threatening to kill her. There are also several times when lyrics were nearly identical to previous songs. Seems like a lot of what he puts out now is material that didn't make the cut of previous albums. His rhymes have started to address and reflect the fact that, for whatever reason, he doesn't get out much and I think this has deeply affected him as an artist. The inspiration and stories just aren't there. He's in a slump alright but by no means should he retire.    I remember the first time I heard Method Man's Play IV Keeps and the lyrics were so gritty it offered scary great visual imagery. If Em could do that... but he's like Elvis or Garbo hiding away in some mansion somewhere watching life pass by and fixating on the past. There's so much good and bad going on in the world but these songs are almost all about him and Kim, killing, & drugs. Tell us a story we haven't heard. Please no more chicks for hooks and pass on the sampling unless it's awesome. I'm waiting for the unification and inspiration from songs like White America or Till I Collapse. The only song that comes close to that on this LP is Not Afraid. Another thing lacking and greatly missed is Em's acidic wit and sarcasm. Window pain made me laugh though.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|I love singer/songwriters and this is one of the best reasons why.  The words, the emotions, the music is real and good. I love it.
0062060554|1.0|I am baffled by the overwhelming number of positive reviews.  This book reads like a laborious walk up a tar hill in mid August.  It's excruciatingly slow and just plain boring at times.  I don't know why I expected it to NOT be like Groundhog Day (not the movie, just the notion of the same thing happening every day) but the glowing reviews gave me hope.  Groundhog Day it is.  What a letdown.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I'll be honest. I bought this movie because I love all things Marvel. I didnt have the chance to see this in theatres, and I wish I did. This movie surpassed all the expectations I had for it. Awesome!
B000WC39SG|1.0|Blu-rays do not have region codes... Or so we thought. I live in Australia and often order Blu-ray from Amazon US and Amazon UK.The resin I get Blu-ray disks is that they are not region coded. This disk, however, is. I have a region '0' Blu-ray player and still it came up with a screen that said you have to have a US player. I have tried it on 4 players and all do the same thing. All of the other Blu-ray disks that I have ordered work with no problems at all. Still... It is a great film, even if I could not watch not watch it on Blu-Ray.
0670022411|3.0|I read every chance I get.  I am a fast reader and very rarely don't finish a book, as I feel that, at worst, I've wasted a few hours.  However, honestly, about halfway through this book I almost gave up, as I could barely tolerate the weak female lead.  She didn't really improve in the rest of the book. :-(    I don't have to have a kick butt, hardcore heroine, but how many times can one human being act helpless, feel weak, pass out, need a nap, have to be carried, etc?  I mean really??  Which also made me struggle to understand why Matthew would be the slightest bit interested in Diana.  I just found her boring and whiny and annoying.    On the other hand, the storyline was very good, and there was some great development with other characters.  Curiosity will probably push me to read the next book, but if I read much of it and find that Diana is still disgustingly wimpy then I may make an exception and not waste my time finishing it.    Fingers crossed the author finds some strength and personality for Diana!
0470876417|4.0|I bought this book to implement its techniques right away at work. Its content was clear & practical and it helped me motivate my team to explore solutions for turning our start-up project into a real venture. Our project didn't make it through but I am sure I will re-read the book & re-use the techniques again & again. Very useful!
1400031567|5.0|The more of the Wallender series I read, the more I impressed with Henning Mankell's writing.  It's a very refined, streamlined story; there are no \\"extras\\" in the book, everything that's there is needed. This story has not been made into a Masterpiece! episode so there are no preconcieved images when reading.  I am very impressed.
B001VNB54A|3.0|I never felt close to these characters the way I felt with the men from Band of Brothers.  Somehow that earlier series was done better... Can't really figure out why, but The Pacific lacked something...
B005DD7H50|5.0|Great movie about how awesome life would be if you fired on all cylinders all the time.  What would life be like if you could remember everything, always be able to access information exactly when you wanted it and had no fear?
0470503696|2.0|Would not recommend this in Kindle form.  The screen shots are unreadable unless text size is enlarged enough, but then the entire screen shot can't be seen on one Kindle screen.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was almost going to buy it, but then found out these are not the same movies I watched when I was a kid.  Thanks one-star Amazon reviewers!
006112429X|5.0|The title and cover art for We Need To Talk About Kevin do not do this book justice. To me, they make the book seem like a beach read or chick-lit.  The book is anything but.  WNTTAK was an amazingly well written book that makes honest psychological observations about the nature of motherhood, the existence of pure evil, and the old debate of nature v. nuture. And it does a masterful job of leaving the reader left to his or her own devices about forming a conclusions based on those observations.      Not only does Shriver give the reader a suspensful and insightful plot, this is really a \\"reader's reader\\" book.  Her phrasing and word choice are deliciously \\"meta.\\"  Follow, for instance, the evolution of usage of the word \\"trite\\" through the story. [Beginning with defining it to young Kevin, to using it to describe the very action the book is based on, to books dealing with school killings in general].  Or the illusion to, and actual usage of, the word \\"absurd.\\" [Kevin as a boy is described as enjoying the absurd, leading to examples of his absurdist english homework, to the act he commits being absurd].    All in all, I can't recommend this book enough.
B003L77GRO|1.0|We were excited that Dexter was finally released.  This is the only one that we purchase.  We thought that after the first part that somewhere it would change and he would get back to his old self but he never did.  It was absolute boring and very disappointing to the end.  Needless to say that we will not be purchasing any future Dexters unless we hear that it has changed.
B00013RC9I|4.0|I'm giving this 4 out of 5 stars because this album doesn't quite live up to the majesty of Air's earlier albums.  But comapred to most albmus out there, this would be a 5 out of 5.      Obviously a listener has to have a preference for this style of music (I would describe it as electro-funk-new wave), and if you do, this album should definitely be in your collection.  But if you're new to the genre, try Moon Safari first.
1594133379|5.0|This is a splendid book which should be made obligatory reading for all in the caring professions.  While it must surely mark a turning point in medical insight, it is clear, concise and makes fascinating reading even to the uninitiated.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|The Bluray disc that I bought did not work on my LG Blu-ray player.  I called 20th Century Fox support number at the back of the box and they said it is fault of the LG Blu Ray player.  They will not accept refunds.  They were pretty rude and adamant that it was entirely the blu ray players fault because millions of people viewed this movie and are happy with it.  And that they never heard anybody call and complain that it didn't work before.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Good story, great special effects, PG-13 rating because of the violence but there's no gore - thank goodness. The characters are a bit one dimensional but if you're looking for light entertainment, then this is a good pick.
0385534639|5.0|I got an eGalley of this book from the publisher for review.  This was an absolutely magical book.  It was beautiful and wondrous; a story that absolutely captured my imagination and drew me in.<br /><br />The Night Circus, Le Cirque des Rêves, is magical and mysterious.  It appears completely set up and is only open at night.  Sometimes the things that take place inside it are a bit too magical.  What the innocent circus attendee doesn't know is that the Night Circus is actually an arena for a competition going on between two magicians.  Celia and Marcus have been forced to study magic from a very young age; their masters used very different methods of teaching.  Then the masters bound Celia and Marcus into a competition to prove which student was the best.<br /><br />This book is told from a number of perspectives.  Parts are shown to you from your perspective as an attendee of the Night Circus and parts from various characters who participate in the circus.  The majority of the book switches between Marcus's and Celia's story; with occasional interruptions by Isobel.<br /><br />The descriptions of the Night Circus and the attractions there are absolutely magical.  Morgenstern writes in such a way that the tents come alive, mysterious and sparkling, in the reader's mind.  The premise of the book and the descriptions within the book are so creative and interesting.  I am not sure how Morgenstern thought up some of these things but I am glad she did because they were absolutely wonderful to read about.<br /><br />The book is incredibly well written and while it has a fine literature feel to it, it is still incredibly easy to read and very engaging.  I read this book super fast, just because I had to know what was going to happen next.  The plot is intricate and very detailed, but never hard to follow.<br /><br />Next there are the characters.  The book is filled with wonderful and quirky characters.  Celia and Marcus will both steal the reader's heart; they are absolutely lovable and engaging.  The relationship they develop is sweet and complicated because of the lengthy competition they face.<br /><br />The book ends well and is wrapped up in a creative and surprising way.  When you think back to the story after reading the book, you realize how well planned out the plot was and how so many intricate things were woven together to make this wonderful story.<br /><br />Overall this was just a fabulous book.  I really enjoyed every little last thing about it.  The plot was intricate, the description beautiful, and just such a creative idea.  The atmosphere of the book is magical and mysterious throughout, but always engaging and easy to read.  Marcus and Celia are very engaging characters who are easy to love, they travel an interesting path together.  I really think everyone should give this book a read.  It is the type of book that should appeal to a wide audience and is appropriate for young adult and older.  If you love magic and mystery in a historical setting this is definitely a must read.  I will be watching out for future books from Morgenstern.tionship they develop is sweet and complicated because of the lengthy competition they face.

0385534639|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT<br /><br /> The Night Circus is a mysterious and  magical place, full of wonder and acts that create awe in anyone who buys a ticket.  Marco and Celia have been preparing for battle since their youth and when both are placed in the circus arena to battle, neither one is exactly certain what this competition is about, nor are they sure about the rules or how a winner is declared.  So they both began to create special tents in order to impress each other, not the judges and in essence become love letters.<br /><br />The story is told almost in a circular fashion, with flashbacks and forwards to help bring the reader to a conclusion. There are also a few minor characters that play important roles, yet you won't connect them together until almost the very end.  Tsukiko, the tattooed contortionist, is one to keep your eye on since she knows exactly what the circus is and gives cryptic hints towards the true meaning of it's existence.  The twins, Poppet and Widget, born when the circus first starts, are wise beyond their years and are inborn with a natural sense of order for the circus.  Bailey becomes infatuated after visiting the circus and soon becomes a Reveur, a group who follow the circus, which are a fascinating group on their own.<br /><br />The descriptions are lush and I found myself going back to reread this book just for the beautiful words.  I am NOT a fan of overly descriptive novels, but this one was really worked for me.  I couldn't quite figure out where the story was going until it was over and it didn't matter, I wanted to join the circus. Oh, forget the review.  THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ THIS YEAR.  Or...at least I can't remember one I liked better so far.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|Loved this movie in the theatres and i just had to purchase it for my home. my kids watch this movie every weekend. When they're happy, I'm happy.
B0029LB2V4|5.0|If you are a fan of period pieces, as am I, you can't go wrong with this series. I have watched the entire series twice and cannot wait to start it again! The scripts are amazing, as are the wardrobes, story lines, and acting by the entire cast. This series will elicit a range of emotions and responses. Better than any history lessons I've ever had--though I know they take poetic license.
B004HNTER6|5.0|Man he was good and to be 1st was his way.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I am in the throes of the magical kind of trance that occurs when I've just been totally immersed for a couple of hours in a marvelous film. This is the real joy of going to the movies.<br /><br />In this case, it is the 2006 Dutch film Black Book directed by Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct). Two hours twenty minutes of excitement, suspense, and wonderful acting. Dutch actress Carice Van Houten gives a remarkable performance, ably backed up by Sebastian Koch, Derek de Lint, and Thom Hoffman. It is truly a pleasure to watch these fascinating, unfamiliar faces as they put most of our American actors to shame.<br /><br />Black Book begins in 1944 Netherlands as the Germans hunt down Jews trying to escape to liberated territory before being shipped off to the death camps. Rachel, the protagonist, survives a devilish trap in which her family is murdered and hooks up with the Dutch underground. In her attempt at revenge, we meet Nazis who become human and allies who betray. The mystery of Black Book is about who betrayed whom and when? I won't spoil the story for you but I will say the intelligent, complex script by Gerard Soeteman and Verhoeven kept me guessing up until the very end.<br /><br />The realistic portrayal of World War II Holland reminded me of an earlier Verhoeven film, Soldier of Orange. He has obviously grown as a director who knows how to tell a good story. He is known for violence and sexual content, but after all Black Book is a war film, not Breakfast At Tiffany's. I'm only sorry I didn't see this exciting film when it was first released, but better late than never. Treat yourself to a copy.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Just started and both characters are at 100% level up. However, I can't figure out what to do to get it to reset so I can get to Level 3.<br /><br />Other then that, it is a fun game so far. I am loving the old-style RPG. Only problem (as others have stated) is the on-screen control sucks and many times sends you in the wrong direction. Even so, still worth purchasing!
B0058VA2U4|5.0|After years of anticipation, Anthrax's new album Worship Music is finally here! No matter the controversy surrounding the making of it, you can tell the band put in all they had into making this album. Probably the biggest and best thing about this is that Joey Belladonna is back on vocals, and despite what other fans think, he will ALWAYS be the voice of Anthrax, though I do enjoy the John Bush era albums as well. With that, some songs do sound like as if they were maybe written for John to sing instead of Joey(Crawl comes to mind). But Joey is amazingly on top of his game on this album, as with the rest of band. Absolutely crushing rhythms from Scott as always, and Charlie is still as solid as steel behind the kit(listening to album for the first time, after the 'Worship' intro into 'Earth on Hell, I nearly had a heart attack!). Frank still plays a meaty, mean bass and sounds fantastic. And Rob has really come into the band well, great solos and playing overall. For the songs, everyone one of this is killer, no filler. There's even a 'secret song' or a continuation of 'Revolution Screams'(remeber when bands used to do that!?). This will definitely be a contender for 'Best Metal Album of 2011' and though it's kind of early to say for sure, It'll be definitely hard to beat!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm excited, so what if Vader says one word .... it may be cheesy but it shouldn't impact everyone's love for the franchise.  People that say they hate it are doing so only for attention as if they are this effected by a few minor changes in some movies, they have issues deeper then Darth Vader yeling \\"No!\\".     It'll be pretty  cool. I'm sure all the complainers will be enjoying the hi-def remake as much as everyone else.
0307887898|5.0|As a developer, entrepreneur and startup mentor, I've seen many startups (and many large companies) fail by building products based on vague market research, unexamined assumptions and wishful thinking.  It's no wonder that nine out of ten startups fail.      The Lean Startup methodology helps entrepreneurs better those odds by giving them the tools to clarify their assumptions, run the right experiments to validate them and use the results to avoid the costly missteps that lead to most new product failures.      I've been mentoring startups with this approach for a few years now, and I can see a big difference between those that follow the approach and those that don't: Those that follow the approach learn faster, make fewer missteps, have a better understanding of their customers and how to solve their problems, and ultimately create better odds of success.     I can highly recommend Eric's book to anyone working in a startup, investing in startups, or working on innovation in a large company.   There is no guaranteed path to startup success, but this sure is a handy compass to make sure you're headed into the right direction.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Movie is excellant and for the price its great entertainment which is what I desire in a movie. If I get educated or lost in a movie in anyway then thats always worth the money and time spent watching. I forgot how long the movie was so make sure you ahve the time and aren't rushed to view. It is an excellant movie and I love all the main characters. A great stay in on a cold rainy night snuggle with your honey kind of movie. Would have a 5 star but then I wouldn't have had to mention the length. I do not normally buy movies to keep. I have maybe 35 movies and several of those were gifts. So I proudly added this one to my collection.
034552554X|5.0|At the opening of the novel, Victoria Jones is eighteen, and therefore, no longer a ward of the state. To begin her life, she is given three months temporary housing and twenty dollars by the social worker who has handled her foster case for years. With that money, Victoria buys five gallons of milk, drinks each gallon, and cuts the containers in half to start a garden in her room.    It is at this early point in the story, when Victoria's fingernails are dirty from stealing plants from suburban yards and cultivating them in the transitional home where she resides, that I fell in love with her. As the novel progressed, each chapter deepened and reaffirmed my commitment to her-starting with her past in cruel foster homes, touching her profound understanding of plants and what they mean, and moving through her times of peace, love, and also, terrible pain. Throughout the book her character achieves a true, gradual, and believable transformation.    The book moves back and forth from Victoria's past to the present, and each character is rendered with dignity and empathy. Diffenbaugh weaves the characters and times together with the beauty and elegance of a well made bouquet, and presents them to her readers in a moving and powerful debut novel.    Reminiscent of WHITE OLEANDER but wholly original, THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS is sure to be a bestseller, and is one of my favorite books of the summer.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I HAVE TO ADMIT I HAVE THE BOOK AND HAVE NOT READ IT YET. YES I KNOW I KNOW I ALWAYS READ THE BOOK FIRST, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE TIME. I SHOULD ALSO ADMIT I HAVE NEVER WATCHED ANY OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS.. I WAS GLAD I HADN'T SEEN ANY OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS.. I WAS ABLE TO PUT A FRESH LOOK ON THIS SHOW. I WAS NOT SO SURE ABOUT WATCHING IT AT FIRST BUT I SAT DOWN AND TURNED THE SHOW ON AND I WAS SO GLAD..I LOVE IT...CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I don't know about you guys, but I absoulutely adored this season. Coming from the magnificent first season was a tall order in itself, and despite some flaws, the second season is a success. The main problem being that the second season was planned over the course of a couple of months, as opposed to Rob Thomas' (probably) whole life when he planned season one as a novel. Knowing that, the writers managed to give us even more exitement than before. You can look to other reviews for the plot details, I'm just a big VM fan who's voicing the fact that season two deserves a second look, and has more to it than meets the eye. Sure, it might seem a little bit TOO much, and the many (seems like gazillion) plot lines tend to wear a little thin, but they wanted to expand the VM universe, and for the most part, they succeeded. A great successor to the first season!

B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Downloaded this app for my thunderbolt after reading mostly good reviews.  Good news: I loved it!  Simple to use - take a photo, define the corners individually (which means you aren't stuck with that strange angle you took your photo at), and save as pdf.  Save one page or multiple to a single document.  The built-in image enhancement gave a very clear image I was happy with, at least for my phone.  We are talking lab notebook scans and high density ink on the page.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is the final straw, Lucas really has gone insane. All I want is the original movies that came out in theaters in blu-ray quality. I don't want extra CG, I don't want horribly done voice overs and sound effects. Just give me the movies that won the Oscars because they are what Star Wars is really about. Don't waste your money.
1591843790|5.0|I'm amazed at the negativity that this book seems to have generated in some quarters. This is, evidently, not some people's cup of tea. Maybe they're just that much more sophisticated than the rest of us. Maybe they've read so many books about relating to people that they're jaded. Maybe they just don't like Guy. Whatever the case, this book is clearly not written for everyone, ad that's something that has to be owned up front.  It's pretty irksome, though, to read from responders who are thankful that they DIDN'T read the book!    That said, I teach graduate coursework in Leadership - not Business courses. Many young professionals who are on their way to whatever dream they are chasing do not get time to hear a lot of the things that are written here. They haven't \\"heard it all before\\" like some of the other reviewers. For them, this is a great introduction to some things that they really need to pay attention to. For all the people out there who actually read a lot of books on business and marketing - and love to pan the ones that they didn't write or just did't like to read - there are thousands of people who have no clue, have not read anything, and will be hit by this material like a bolt from the blue. Yes, it is rather simplistic to be told how to talk, how to listen, how to dress, how to work with online resources, and how to do a number of things that many of us do every day. But there are a whole lot of people out there who are trying to move up the ladder with little or no exposure to such things, and they need books like this.    So this is a very good and important book, and if you don't need it, good for you. The rest of the world should buy their copy ASAP.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I bought this thing in keeping with the ethos of my speaker system: a chain of insane-bang-for-the-buck products. Cheap to the point of painfully cheap, but nothing is low-quality.     This means:    Lepai Tripath TA2020A+ (TA-2020 chip T-Amp)  Fostex FE206e-based speakers   Bottlehead Seduction tube phono preamp (DIY kit)  Music Hall MMF-5 turntable  etc.    amongst other peer-reviewed insane-value DIY interconnects, cables, etc.     And now, of course, the Fiio D3.    I was dying to try some HDtracks music, but was not keen on the whole \\"laptop headphone out\\" method of feeding it to my system. Reasoning that some of the recordings are 24bit at 192khz sample rate, I might as well find a DAC that does 192khz.     The Fiio D5 (USB version of this DAC) only goes up to 96khz. The D3 is the only one that does 192khz. Couple that with the fact that my Macbook Pro has a toslink out and it made for an easy decision, I got the Fiio D3.     I have put in past audio-based reviews on Amazon that I came from a Head-Fi.org / headphone audiophile lineage, and owned everything from my starter cans, Grado SR-80's, through Sennheiser HD-600's, on up to a pair of the magical Stax Omega II headphones paired with a Kevin Gilmore-designed custom electrostatic amp. I realized the top of the heap (or the top of one of the higher heaps, anyways) is a great place to be, but the marginal increases in absolute ENJOYMENT relative to price were just not there.     I sold all that and moved on for a few years, only to return a short time ago.     Since then, and you may laugh, I wanted to go a lot more portable and a LOT cheaper. Bang for the buck, in other words. I wanted no separate headphone amp (an audiophile sin, I know, but my strong choice), just a pair of stock cans and a stock mp3 player to enjoy as-is. By reading reviews and careful purchasing and testing, I have found that for day to use, I really dig and enjoy the Sennheiser sound as expressed through the better-sounding-than-iPod Sansa Clip+ and Sennheiser PX-100 headphones playing FLAC audio files. It has huge natural soundstaging, is very much alive and yet flatters lower-quality recordings, making just about all music sound GREAT (even pop) without sacrificing NATURAL and living detail. It is a fun, rewarding portable rig.     Anyhow, I also took the same tack at home, building the DIY speakers mentioned above, built around a tremendously rewarding T-amp system.     So back to the Fiio D3...    I spent some quality time with the D3 last night, connected to my Macbook Pro 13\\" (mid-2010) via the very convenient toslink output that doubles as a headphone jack.     I heard that you can only get 192khz from a Macbook Pro if you boot into Windows and use some Realtek HD driver...but my chip is a Cirrus, has (according to Apple's bootcamp assistant, anyways) the very latest and best driver, and it only shows 96khz available as the maximum sampling rate! Suck. Oh well, I don't have many 192khz recordings yet, and I do have a lot of 96khz ones. For now, this thing sat at 96khz as the toslink upsample rate for the duration of this session.     I wanted to get time with it comparing it to the headphone output (approximating line-out, which you cannot truly get with the stock Macbook Pro. As usual, I had to \\"approximate\\" the line level signal, which in this case was best served by matching the rough volume of the output of the Fiio D3.     I plug this thing in and at first blush am not sure what is better: the Fiio D3 or the Macbook Pro headphone out.     The Macbook pro on first inspection had this sort of dewy-fresh, lithe, living sound that when compared to the Fiio was easier to listen to.     Putting the Fiio D3 back in, I found the sound to be orders of magnitude CLEANER: the bass of the TA2020 with my high-efficiency Fostex FE206e speakers marked a huge bass upgrade from my older TA-2024 Sonic Impact T-amp, while retaining the top-end qualities of the older amp. The Fiio D3 delivers a very separate and distinct low bass that dances independently of the upper ranges in a pleasing and natural way. The Fiio also delivers a much more \\"immediate\\" macro-sound...but loses out somewhat on micro-detail, such as space and naturalness, those audiophile intangibles that are so critical to the ILLUSION we seek, which is BELIEF.     (By the way, I stopped listening to audiophile geeks in forums long ago...terminology, hair-splitting subtleties and tense listening are what they specialize in...I have come to realize after doing that myself for quite a while, that the important thing is \\"how does it make you FEEL?\\" Do you feel like the performer is in the room? The band? Etc.)    The D3, in my opinion, initially suffers from a pretty bad case of \\"digitalitis.\\" You know, where certain female voices, violins, snare drums, etc. just reach out at you a little too aggressively, with too little refinement and air? In other words, fatiguing sound?    After a few hours of listening (or perhaps ear-deadening!) I noticed that particularly low treble band started to smooth out. Leaving it run overnight (and getting a \\"fresh set of ears\\") confirmed that burn-in is noticeable with this unit, so give it a day to run before you do your more critical listening. Not perfect but better.     The sound is frustratingly veiled. I should NOT be complaining at this price, and I am not. But it is SO good at sounding \\"WHOA, LIVE!\\" but never quite gets to sounding \\"WHOA, ALIVE!\\" It suffers from that \\"Really Good Concert PA\\" sound...you know it's there in the room with you, but you don't believe in it entirely. There is \\"system sound\\" to it, not exquisite, natural and live sound. Acoustically recorded albums are presented gorgeously, but there are either tweaks in my system that need to be done, or there is just some sort of frustratingly insurmountable felt-like veil to the sound. You KNOW there is living, breathing music behind it, your mind says so, and the high-quality overall sound and macro-detail make it obvious, but just for some reason those fine, fine details, the air, the space in the room, etc. are being muffled.     Don't get me wrong: for the price (or any price up to $200-300) this thing is amazing in it's class. I am exaggerating some of the downsides (for example, drums can sound very real and immediate on this thing, big, bold and real-drum-kit-sized in your room...they often do in mine with the Fiio D3. Only the cymbals really suffer much from lack of air around them, lack of absolute resolution, etc.) For twenty-eight bucks it's a no brainer if you were not going to spend any more anyways.     As for possible solutions...    The RCA outputs are cheap-looking, but it's no matter: I am probably going to remove the cheapo RCA's and hard-wire some Cat5 or other interconnects into it and use the holes left as their portals of exit. At this cheap, who cares.     Obviously my goal is to minimize mechanical and maximize hardwired/soldered connections. It's the cheap but inconvenient way to get halfway to \\"high end interconnects\\"...nothing more pure than a direct mechanical soldered connection!    Anyhow, this thing is very much in the \\"Grado\\" camp - detail to a fault. I spent years with my headphone rigs listening mostly to 60's tiki records, because they were so gorgeously recorded and presented on all my rigs. But I do love pop. And rock. And all that \\"fun\\" and - yes - modern music.     When your SYSTEM (and not your TASTES) is forcing you to listen to a certain kind of record or certain kind of music, I think that is a problem. A big problem. A really big problem. A huge...well, you get where I am going with this.    If I like Tears for Fears' first record, or if I dig Cee-Lo Green's latest or Junior Senior or Lykke Li or Alice in Chains...I want my system to present them in a flattering way, just as flattering as that acoustically recorded jazz record or that godforsakenly cheesy Tiki lounge record from the 60's. Systems do exist which DO this. Yours should as well. \\"Warts and all\\" is just a ridiculous attachment to \\"that one time I heard more detail from this one album, therefore I am into the 'warts and all' sound.\\" That is not music, and now how music should be reproduced. That Alice In Chains record sounded awesome when it was being recorded...not a squealy screetching grinding mess like it does on gear that suffers from peaky performance or non-aesthetic distortions.     Just like the above example, there is penty of art to be had in pop...yet some systems (cough::grado::cough) just DO NOT present it well. It's fatiguing and a slog through a marathon, versus fun, natural and beautiful.     I always laugh when people say Sennheiser headphones are \\"dark\\" or are not good for pop and rock. Au contraire, mon frere: you have not heard pop until you have cranked it up (because you can do that without wanting to scream from ear pain) on a pair of Sennheisers.     This presentation is more Grado-like: it has detail, but there is too much. Treble is shouty in bands, mainly. It has a TON going for it...midrange can be a touch flat, and this definitely has a \\"solid state\\" sound signature: literal, erring towards too much of things (versus a tube-like \\"a touch shy in parts\\"...which I prefer, all told).    Anyways, this thing is definitely worth $200-300 IMO, made a noticeable and large improvement in the immediacy, depth and live-ness (if not alive-ness) of sound and thus it will stay in my system.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|After watching the entire set, I can appreciate both trilogies a lot more in HD. Despite the minor changes to the original movies, I don't mind so much, although I had a knee-jerk reaction... The picture is really beautiful and the surround sound is amazing. I haven't finished the extras yet but I am very happy I got this set. If the tv show ever comes to pass I'll be watching day one and pre-ordering on blu-ray. This set is worth the $80.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Was curious to hear Hugh Laurie as a musician and was not disappointed. I feel transported - close my eyes and sway in another and much happier world. What a shame he deprived us of this very special treat for so long (and deprived himself of sharing this joy). Yes he may not be a great singer but it doesn't matter - he makes me smile and perhaps appreciate his playing even more. Love him as an actor but if it is a case of choosing one profession over another, then please keep music - it's a pleasure that keeps on giving. Am now purchasing 3 more copies so that I can share this pleasure.
B000002KOO|4.0|As a live outfit, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac was nearly unmatched. As proof of that, do yourself a favor and get their three-disc \\"Live at the Boston Tea Party.\\" However, they never were able to quite capture the forcefulness of their live show in the studio. Their first couple records just sound like by-the-book rehashes of classic blues songs, with a few admittedly awesome Green originals.    Then Play On is as close as the original Mac gets to realizing its potential in the studio. Again, though it's close but no cigar. You can hear it all on the title track. Anybody who has heard a live cut of this song knows it is just about the best blues-rock track ever made, but the studio version is relatively muted with a lengthy acoustic instrumental at the end. It's good and all, but just not the same as the live cut.    It's a real shame that Green left the band after this record. You get the impression from this (as well as his last single, the Green Manalishi) that he and the band were really on the cusp of a major breakthrough. But it never happened.
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|I am a huge Fright Night and Colin Farrell fan so this was a perfect combo. I enjoyed the movie very much. It differs a bit in the plotline from the original version. Chris Sarandon makes a cameo appearance in the film as a motorist who meets an untimely demise.
B000002J6F|5.0|Anybody who loves the country rock of the latter-day Byrds, Burrito Brothers, or Gene Clark will love this twenty-one song masterpiece. Eclectic, gorgeous, and timeless. Somebody will be listening to this in 100 years, and really digging it. Stephen Stills would have better chart success with CSNY, but he'd never top Manassas.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|The choice of music could not have been better.  The addition of Crosby and Nash singing harmonies is magical.  The audience that night saw an amazing concert.  I was stunned to see 1 star reviews for this awesome DVD and then I saw the problem... Those people are not reviewing this concert, they are reviewing Blue Ray.  There needs to be another area for people to whine about Blue Ray or mix-ups with customer service, etc., it's not right that an artists' work gets slammed for other reasons.  This is a 5 star performance, avoid the Blue Ray, I suppose, if you want to appreciate this fantastic concert.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|He had a voice as good as Richard Manuel's, a lyrical talent as incisive as Bob Dylan's, and a musical touch as rich as Lennon and McCartney's. And it all comes together on No Other. It's a true gem.

MAN I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT TOTALLY ROB OF THE FIRST FILM WHICH BY FAR THE BEST OF THE SERIES. NOW I'M STUCK WITH DOUBLE DISC OF FREDDY VS JASON AND NEW NIGHTMARE WHILE I ALREADY HAVE SEPARATE DISC OF EACH FILM. WOW TOTAL BUMMER, OTHERWISE I AM HAPPY WITH THE COLLECTION BUT THAT ONE MISTAKE JUST PUTS TO SHAME EVERY THING A MISSCUE IN THE SHIPPING OR SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!!![[ASIN:B0033B5XCS Nightmare on Elm Street Collection]]
B0016CTX68|5.0|This album is a perfect 43 minutes of music, one of only a handful of true rock 'n' roll masterpieces.     If Robert Johnson came back from the dead and heard the Stones do his version of \\"Love In Vain,\\" he'd be green with envy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a well written adventure tale for young adults. It is set in a post apocalyptic America where the population is virtually enslaved. It features the adventures of the contestants in a reality show which pits twenty four children against each other in a fight to the death. A refreshing change from vampires!
B003LAUBAK|5.0|Anybody who has been to a Rolling Stones concert knows that there is some effervescent quality that just can't be captured on record, though lord knows that the Glimmer Twins have tired over the years. Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out is as close as they've ever come. Which in turn makes me wonder: why DON'T you have this record yet? Do you not like music or something?
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Battlestar Gallactical Blu-Ray - 'The 2004 Complete Series' DVDs is one of the best sci-fi space series I've ever seen. These DVDs are the mini series that was on TV.  The acting is terrific and the filiming is really great. If you want a new DVD set and love space - get it. I got mine on Amazon. The Complete series includes The Razor in Season 4, and also a separate DVD for 'The Plan'. Oh my fracken god this is so good. lolol
B004WJRF6C|4.0|I've long felt that so much of Beatle Paul's solo work is just a little too cute. Like, Paul knows that people expect him to be the sweet one, so he's playing to type. The self-awareness of \\"Silly Love Songs\\" is a great example of what I'm getting at.<br /><br />Well, his first solo album is cute without feeling calculated. It's just him loving the country life with his new family. A great little record. Don't expect too much of it -- and I promise you won't be disappointed.
B004SQS9FA|3.0|As the headline proclaims, This was my first Radiohead album    For some reason, when I listen to previews of albums on music services, I hate them immedietly.  But then I think, 'hey I'll just go back, and listen to it again, just to be sure I don't want it.'  Such was the case with King Of Limbs.  However, as soon as I bought it, the tracks that I like were immedietly apparant.  I'll list them  Feral  Lotus Flower  Codex (favorite of the album.  I bought the sheet music, actually)  Give up the ghost    I also will listen to: Morning Mr Magpie, and Little By Little, though they're not amazing tracks.    I can't decide how to rate this. On the one hand, I like half the songs on the album (8 tracks long, for those of you who aren't so gifted with adding and subtracting), and will tolerate another two, but on the other hand, this is not an easily accessible album.  I have no idea why I started my Radiohead collection with this work, and I seriously think that it almost dettered me from coming back.  But come back I did, and recommend this album I will.  Though not for newcomers.  For you, I suggest The Bends, or maybe Hail To The Thief (one of my favorites)
B000THCKF2|3.0|Derivative of Thick as a Brick, only more pompous and without nearly as many hooks. And I would say that \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\" has not aged well, but I'm guessing people rolled their eyes back then.
0446547603|4.0|I'm a fan of Nicholas Sparks and he's back here at his best.  Safe Haven is a beautifully told story, with his familiar, excellent writing style.  The characters all come alive, as they do in most of his books. My only criticism is the crazy twist at the end... I won't give it away, as I'm sure that some people like it, but to me, it knocked the realism out of the story.    Still, if you're heading out of town for a long weekend and need an easy, enjoyable read, this is a good one.
4789004546|5.0|I just bought this for my 201 class.  We are using Genki II and if you know anything about the Genki series....things aren't explained the greatest sometimes.  All texts have their weak points, but if you want to see more examples and have a better understanding, use the exercises and examples from this book and from Genki.  Highly recommended if you are planning on studying past the 200 level.  Awesome index for easy reference, it's great all around.  Also, you get Kanji, kana, and romaji, so no matter what level you are, this book gives you all you will need.
B003ZHVJFA|4.0|Spoiler Alert!     Okay 4 out of 5 stars for a video game based movie that's excellent!!! I liked how this movie actually tried to make the movie like the video game. In the beginning and in the middle the story was really good. After that at some point the story just goes crazy and doesn't make sense, well at least to me it didn't.     At the end of the film, which I hated that the most, the writers made way too much room for a second movie. I think that's where they made the biggest mistake and I would had given it 5 stars. This is what I would had expected to see for an ending. Jin wins the tournament, and then Jin and Christine start off helping change the world they live in for the better. Jin has just won Tekken and now he is KING of the fighters and also the head of the company. He has the power to change the world as he sees it now. Also, he has the people vote. Jin and Christine should live happy ever after with each other too. But no, that doesn't happen.     What happens at the end of the movie? When Jin wins, I see him say \\"I'm going home\\". He then hurries and leaves the place. The narrator then says \\"this is just the beginning.\\" What kind of ending was that? He just won king of the fighters! This is what he wanted to do from the start and he fought so hard to do. He doesn't show any joy or emotion about it. He looks stone cold dead and leaves the place like he is pissed. WHAT???     Also, he doesn't stay with Christine at the end? I thought they really liked each other. Well, that's what I saw in the movie because it sure looked like there was a love story brewing. What worse about the movie is, why does he have to go in the first place? Where is he going go? His home is Tekken! His old house that he was living in actually blew up. Is he going to rebuild it or something? Why? He has a whole corporation and he can live anywhere he wants. So, he should actually head upstairs.      The scene where he starts walking with people in the city towards the camera is good. It is just done wrong where the narrator should had said something like Jin is the new boss and he going to change the world with Christine by his side.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I went to see Bridesmaids in theater which was sold out and saw Thor instead. I had no idea what it was even about...wow what a nice surprise! Very entertaining heroic film with lots of action for the guys and nice shirtless men for the ladies haha. I immediately put a request in for Thor Blue Ray before it was released. This is one of those movies you have to see in HD or 3D! 5 stars all the way.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|My Star Wars Blu-ray box set arrived this morning from Amazon (much to my surprise) and right away my son and I were ready to go! Wonderful packaging, albeit identical to the packaged style of the recent Aliens Anthology on BR.<br />One minor miff though; box set arrived with TWO ROTJ disks sans disk 2 of the bonus features. This kinda ticks me a bit, but in a silly way, it makes mine a minor collectable. I hope GL and gang get this fixed soon.<br /><br />As for the haters out there piping on about GL destroying your childhood, get over it. Make a movie and do what you want with it. Personally, I enjoy all of the versions still because they ARE different. Why do I buy a remix album? Because it is different. Hey, I saw Ep IV in theaters on the opening night in '77 and every opening night since and you know what...my childhood is full of happy memories and one way or another and GL, Ben Burtt & the gang had something to do with that.<br /><br />Let's go HiDef!!!
1595141979|4.0|I literally picked up this book the second that I finished Frostbite (#2). I am completely absorbed in this series and I've been talking about it like they're real people.<br /><br />The plot thickens, as they say, in this book. Rose meets the queen (who's a complete snot, by the way) and a mysteriously handsome character appears as well, Adrian. He's also a royal Moroi and is the great-nephew to Queen Tatiana; plus he has a few secrets of his own. The conspiracy in this book is WAY bigger than the last two put together, and the unthinkable and unbelievable happens as well. The Strigoi have always posed a threat to the Moroi and dhampirs but not on a scale like this in centuries. There seems to be a revolution in the making, too many secrets, double-crossing, and conspiracies flying in every direction.<br /><br />One very good thing is that Rose has a lot of trusted allies on her side to even the playing field. Lissa and Christian's relationship is blossoming beautifully - minus a few jealousy issues - but Rose seems to be taking the brunt of everything for EVERYONE. Her main objective and driving force is to keep everyone she cares about safe--but at what cost? Her passion and determination have started to really take a toll on her mentally and physically and I swear, her love life could not be more complicated...but at least Dimitri is there to reassure her.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending, but as I think about the LONG day ahead at work. I can't wait to get home and dig into the fourth book, Blood Promise. Talk about a cliffhanger! I could hardly sleep after I finished this book--but I'm sure all my questions will be answered soon when I blow through the next book. I can hardly stand to think the series will take away a certain...something/someone without there being more to the story. Want to know what I'm talking about? Go out and grab this series ASAP - it's absolutely worth a read. I think since I'm halfway through the series now--it's safe to say that this is by far one of my favorite series that I have ever read.avorite series that I have ever read.
0811875040|4.0|A well-established bakery publishing their signature recipes must be generous. A lot of businesses have clad their secrets with irons so nobody would figure out anything right. True this book has errors. In spite of that, these are errors that avid bakers can point out and remedy readily. Also, Amazon has contacted all buyers of this book that a corrected version will be mailed free of charge at time of pending publication. What more can you ask? The one missing star is reserved for the corrections.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I've been a fan of King's work for a long time, but this one leaves me to wonder about his work ethic.  The style is classic King, drawing the reader in with relateable characters and an intriguing premise.  However, just when this story showed potential for a \\"Christine\\" or \\"Cujo\\" type scenario, with a mind-game battle to the death with an unimaginable evil, it just... ended.  While I can appreciate a story leaving the reader to ponder a few unanswered questions, this one only leaves me to wonder what King was thinking.  This had the potential to be a classic full-length novel, but instead it has soured me to any future writing by this once-great author.  The King is dead, long live the King...
1427210497|2.0|Unlike many other reviewers here, I never read Franzen's Corrections, and after reading Freedom, I'm not sure I ever will. At it's core, Freedom is novel of enormous length & wordiness, but it truly has very little to say. With the exception of perhaps Jessica, the main characters are driven by a pathological desire to make themselves and everyone around them miserable. Walter, in his sparkling goodness, may be the character who generates the widest orbit of misery. He is as lost and misguided as the rest of the cast, but he's such a 98-lb weakling, that you want him to stand up and fight back. Sadly, when he finally does, I couldn't help but think of someone like Woody Allen getting upset and going medieval. Even his rant sounds like nerdy whining. Patti is an idiot. Richard is perhaps the most interesting character in the book, but in his stereotypical rockerness, he fills too convenient of a mold to find solid footing. The entire novel slides fitfully back and forth in a rut of sexual disappointment, sexual pursuit, thinking about disappointing sexual pursuits and descriptively repulsive sexual conversations. All of the characters are driven by it. They all ruin their lives because of it, and none of them find their conquests rewarding (except maybe Lolitha). A better editor could not have saved this book, but he or she could have saved many of us who read it from having to endure quite so much. I did find one redeeming quality, though. I listened to the audio version, and the narrarator was very good. Alas, unless you just like to hear a good reader, I implore you to take a pass on this one. You'll be happy you saved the 25 hours or so of your life.
B001QWBM62|3.0|I bought the Zoom H4N so I could record dual system audio along with my Canon 5DMK II. The noise floor on the device is too high when using phantom power. There is a NOTICEABLE HISS.  You also only get about 45 minutes of recoding time when using phantom power. If i had a do over... I would buy something else. This unit is meant for musicians, not for vocal recording.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Another cancelled pre-order here, you already know why. The 5-star voters here, if you're under 25 or so and these are the versions you grew up on, then I understand and I don't begrudge you your preferred version. However, if you're older than that and you gave this atrocity 5 stars... shame on you. You really should know better. Were you ever even really a fan? Look, I AM a geek, and I'm proud of that fact. I was proud of it before it was an \\"in\\" thing to be, and I'll still be proud of it when pop culture has sucked the very concept of geekdom dry (although I don't live in Mom's basement; sorry, cheap stereotypers!). The Star Wars financial empire may have been built on merchandising and toys, but its legacy and cultural cachet was built upon the patronage of \\"geeks\\" like myself. You say George Lucas doesn't owe anything to anybody? I say he owes US. Beyond owing us as loyal fans, he owes us as consumers. As a consumer, all I want is a choice! If he's so certain of the superiority of his vision, then make all versions available (yes, that includes the original crawl without \\"Episode IV\\", to all you Lucas fanboys that like to play semantics) in COMPARABLE quality (not simply load the decks by dumping the theatrical versions onto limited edition DVDs with laserdisc-quality transfers) and let the \\"special\\" editions stand on their own merits. But he won't do that. \\"The negative's too badly damaged.\\" \\"It's too expensive.\\" \\"It wasn't what I originally intended.\\" Blah blah blah. All weak excuses, and I'm sure he'll have a new batch of lines ready for the next home video format release. I'm done with it; been done with it. Keep your farting pratfalls and CGI muppetry. Long live G.O.U.T.!

B000001DWG|5.0|Wow. I had been reading for years about the importance of this album in establishing the \\"Seattle Sound\\", but had never given it a chance.  I had always assumed it would be rather unpolished (but good) like some of the older Mudhoney and Green River records.  This album is an amazing listen and I am only sorry that I didn't pick it up two decades ago.

0439023513|4.0|I started reading these books after having a great chat about books with one of my friends. I wasn't expecting much, just looking for a good read to get my mind off all the science classes I've been taking. I was shocked act how vividly descriptive Collins is with her violence. But shocked in a good way. She doesn't hold back, but neither does she become gratuitous. The violence fits the story. The description of the settings and events are just about perfect as well. A little cheesy here and there when it comes to military scenarios (my fault for being in the military, it spoils books and movies all the time), but overall her ability to use details to move the story forward give her books a brisk, easy (not unintelligent, just not difficult) pace. However, her character development outside of her three main characters (Katniss, Peeta, and Gale) is pretty week. I have always thought that first person perspective in literature is the weakest way to tell a story. It's so limited by, obviously, one perspective. It works on some levels, but not on others. I believe is why Kat's character is so passive all the time. This allows other characters to have more of an effect on her. It works most of the time, since circumstances in the story rely on her to react more often than simply act. If there wasn't a war, a Hunger Games, or a family to feed, Kat would be another rank and file citizen of her district. Kat really isn't an exciting person, she can just do exciting things in right situations. But enough about Kat, there were moments in the other books that offered perfect opportunities for characters to express themselves allowing the readers to learn more about the people they've gone through hell with. But no, Collins paraphrases dramatic moments for some apparent reason. I don't want to say laziness because obviously she isn't lazy (award winning novelist!), but I don't get it. Conversations with Haymitch, Prim, Kat's mom, all could have gone along way to give thesesupporting characters some life. Which could have made these books masterpieces instead of just really good reads.      Still I did absolutely love the ending. It was perfectly done so that it wasn't sappy but still gave hope that the characters will move on with their lives and find some measure of happiness. And as anyone who has tragedy strike their lives knows, the pain and memories never really fade, they just get easier to deal with. And hopefully they don't change you so much that you become a monster. That's a hard concept for some writers to grasp, but Collins does it with ease. So, in the end I am glad I read this series, but it definitely does not impact my life the way some books have. Still, fours stars Collins. The movies better be R though, the content deserves to be preserved, otherwise it will lose it's context.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Season two of Spartacus ~ Gods of the Arena arrived a few days ago and I tore into it hopping it would not be a letdown from Season one. From the first frame in episode one to the final fadeout in episode six I was taken beyond my expectations and my hopes we not dashed on the rocks below the Lunista of Batiatus (as is the fate of one delicious character in season two.)<br />  A great story line is the key to the wonderful series and a solid foundation for this outing. Wonderful in all aspects from direction to art direction and costumes it is a Roman orgy for the senses.<br />  The actors are all top notch with outstanding performances by Lucy Lawless and John Hannah at the top of the list of startling and moving work by the huge cast. And not a single one of them is hard on the eyes. The name of the game in casting the gladiators for the most part is \\"Good Skin, Small nose, big muscles.\\" And both Dustin Clair as Granicus and Manu Bennett as Crixus fit the bill AND they are great actors to boot.<br />  Another stand out for me was the beautiful and titillatingly wicked Jamie Murray as Gaia. What a fabulous actress and what a role she has to play. She adds so much spice to this stew of blood and bones. I also found Josef Brown as Aticus to be a great addition to the cast. What heat and passion he brings to the role of the lover of the always wonderful Antonio Te Maioha as Barca. The outcome of this bro-mance is a stunner. And one must not overlook the immense talents of Peter Mensah as Doctore. His layered and deeply felt portrait is a keystone performance in this his second season of the series.<br />  The entire show was a treat and it goes without saying that though we have lost the original star of Spartacus Andy Whitfield who was brilliant and made season one sing, I am looking forward to season three. The post revolt when the might of Rome comes face to face with the most famous slave revolt in history. It should be amazing!

B00005JMJG|5.0|This move is a must-see for those who can relate, which is just about everyone. Kate Winslet plays the quirky, fun Clementine, while Jim Carrey soars in his role alongside her. Their chemistry is charming and is remarkable work by 2 tremendous actors. The movie focuses on Clementine and the complex, undeniable attraction she shares with Joel. Following an attempt at a relationship, Clementine decides to have her memory of Joel removed. What follows in the aftermath is the heart of the movie, in my opinion. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has loved someone so much and had to let them go, someone who let one get away, or someone who is a hopeless romantic.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|I bought this cd yesterday at my friendly neighborhood Coffee Conglomerate.  I didn't have to go anywhere yesterday so I tucked it away in my bag, knowing I had errands to run today, kids in tow.  I bought it as a \\"Mom Rocks\\" present for myself, and I was glad I did when I read the liner notes having not heard a single note on the album.  Today was a gloomy day.  The kind of day that calls for stew, crusty bread and a warm cup of tea.  I shuffled the kids into he car, buckled them in, and popped this cd in my ghetto-rigged cd player.    The first bar opened up as the sky above me decided to follow suit.  The slight pitter patter of rain on my windshield was the perfect accompaniment to a fantastic album.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear his talent tug at my soul while I wound my way through Denver on a rainy day.  My two year old was even silent while it was on; it was as if he was letting himself soak it all in, which is gorgeous when you get to witness it.  I must recommend this album to anyone who appreciates good music for what it is:  It's a passport to your own soul.  It may have nooks and crannies that can take you by surprise, but you are richer for the experience.
1932100660|5.0|This book is a breakthrough and a must read for any one going or thinking of going vegan/plant strong. While a lot of vegan books give you recipes, reasons to go vegan, why and how being vegan can help the environment/, etc., this books gives you hard core proof as why you should go vegan for your health. Which, above all, should be your most important reason. I suggest this book along with Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn. He and Dr. Campbell are pioneers and heros in my book.
B0046M4H70|5.0|yes i might be a little crazy to compare orlando to the greek figure tiresias but i have to be honest. orlando is virginia wolfes verison of tiresias in some form. i love this movie and the actors that performed their parts. the music is good and the time jump from elizabeth the first to the modern day is well done. i recommed this gender-bending movie,because its spell casting and the story of searching for your own happiness is that good too.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|Star Wars was the first movie I ever saw in the theater, mind you I am only 21 so it was the re-release version and it was great. I absolutely love the original trilogy, and I love the other three as well but in a laughable kind of way. I have not purchased this blue-ray set do to the good reviews so many have posted. It's upsetting to take the laughable sensation of the prequels and add it to the amazing films that we all really enjoy. When I saw episode 3 I witnessed people crying at the end when Anakin becomes Darth Vader and Padme dies...As I'm laughing my a** off because of \\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" And if they truly added that to RotJ...this series has fallen to the DARKSIDE!

B00005RDRO|4.0|A fun film that spoofs murder mysteries with a well known cast (from the 70s), including a relatively young James Cromwell (who wouldn't become super popular until later).  Tale focuses upon the five greatest detectives brought to the mansion of an eccentric who wants them to solve a murder before it happens as well as prove to said five detectives that he's more clever than all of them combined. For an old film the humor was impressively delivered. Nice pickup of pace in the end, too. Four scenes (including one with Sherlock Holmes) were deleted from the film but shown in the original broadcast. The script for this film was nominated by the Academy Awards. The real Truman Capote made a rare movie appearance as the eccentric.STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; HUMOR: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early September 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.; BEST DIALOGUE: Sidney Wang: Big house like man married to fat woman: hard to get around.//// Sidney Wang: What meaning of this, Mr. Twain?

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Received my copy today and just watched A New Hope and browsed the other movies. The audio is excellent throughout especially when the Death Star explodes in IV, with the shock wave going right round you. The inner part is like a book and each disc is housed in a cardboard sleeve, which is very easy to remove, so no worries about scratching. Not too keen on the artwork, but minor issue compared to the content. Highlight for me is the Pod Race in Phantom Menace. Every bit as good as when I originally watched it in the cinema, with the pods whizzing from every speaker.<br />The black Blu-Ray header is not attached, like the Lord of The Rings leaving a neat looking box.
B0034G4P80|4.0|THOR, based on the graphic novels of old as well as Norse Mythology, was penned as an idea back in 2001 but then went into \\"development hell\\" for several years before it was moved along into an actual movie for release. And understandably so as the budget for this picture was $150M. Fortunately, THOR's overall box office yielded over $448M as of August 25th of this year so that means there will be a part 2 in July, 2013 (BTW, be sure to watch the end credits for the usual surprise that has Samuel Jackson in it). The special effects are impressive, the acting is above average to good and the overall story, while not brilliant, is good and seems to follow the general idea of the graphic novels (though take that with a grain of salt as I've read a few of them but don't have the whole collection on my shelf). Women who want a pretty boy beefcake get a few shots of the actor scantily clad and Thor fans will get a lot of overview of the Asgardian world (as well as Jotunheim) and a ton of Mjolnir action. The Frost Giants are done well and the play on ice was particularly better than I thought. Thor is headstrong and dumb early on but hopefully gains some wisdom (though I doubt he'll ditch his famous temper). Some people may have been expecting more of a battle epic ending but the focus was more on Thor's character maturing enough to become a great king like his father so the incident with the Bifrost Bridge shouldn't be entirely surprising (even if disappointing to some). Purists might have issue that not all of the Asgardians are white but who's to say those gods can't represent mortals all over the world? After all, who says the old Norse people got it right on skin colors anyway? That said, it's a nice inclusion of non white viewers into the world and this is the 21st century so it's probably a good move just as it's a good idea to have female style action heroes to make females feel more included in the fun. The romance with Portman was ho hum but acceptable. Loki was predictable but better than expected and Anthony Hopkins was a notch below par. I'm glad the franchise will continue as Thor is one of the more interesting Marvel Heroes.

Heimdall: None do. //// Agent Phil Coulson: [interrogative] It's not easy to do what you did. You made my men - some of the most highly trained professionals in the world - look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops. In my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them. Why don't you tell me where you received that training? Afghanistan, Chechnya?

B0058VA2U4|5.0|If you're a metal fan, then definitely check this one out. I'm still surprised at how few metal fans really have experienced Anthrax. This CD is some of the best work they've done as a whole. Other CDs have tracks that I like, but only about 40% of it. This one is more like 90%. I like EVERY track on this CD, but there are a couple that aren't at the same levels as the other tracks.<br /><br />I can't wait until they record another album with Joey, where he's working with them from the start.
0807014273|5.0|Frankl's narrative brings me face to face with Nazi concentration camp: the abhorring degradation of fellow human beings, mass murdering, barbaric treatment of prisoners. Yet, human souls were able to seek comfort in natural beauty in such unbearable existence. Ultimately the book is about triumph, particularly spiritual triumph despite all the suffering one went through. If a person can emerge from such experience: being stripped naked, taken away all possessing, being beaten and starved, doing harsh labor in the bitter winter, facing arbitrary death in every moment, later learned that his parents and wife were all killed in gas chamber, but coming out compassionate, forgiving and becoming a successful doctor and author (publishing 30 books afterwards), how can we not marvel at human resilience?<br /><br />The eventual survival of Frankl may be due to luck (not boarding the last train), his own social smart (avoiding offending prison guards, befriending the foremen), and kindness from fellow prisoners (extra bread saved, joint escape attempt). But it also crucially depended on his spiritual strength and holding on to the final hope. He called this search of \\"meaning of suffering\\". By assigning meaning to his suffering,  he then would not fall prey to bitter disappointment when liberation did come at an expected date, while a fellow prisoner lost hope and died. In other words, Frankl found a way to maintain eternal hope. It is this hope enables him to stand strong despite any suffering or disappointment.<br /><br />In the last chapter,  Frankl offered an invaluable explanation on logotherapy. Its methodology is enlightening, much similar to what Anthony Robbins has preached all along in his seminar. Humans need \\"meaningful goals\\" to feel happy.<br /><br />Each of us goes through life with unique experience. No one can repeat that experience for us. Even our suffering is unique. Thus the meaning of our life is put upon us instead of us searching for it. It is how we answer life, in our unique way.<br /><br />The bare truth of concentration camp, the honesty and the compassion deeply touches me. There is no self pity or hatred. Instead you experience a deep sense of beauty in this writing. All you feel is a much larger understanding for human existence and the ultimate triumph of human spirit.<br /><br />How can we feel despair when men endured and survived concentration camp? Even if the world problem is daunting, Frankl said, \\"the world may be in a bad state, but everything will become worse unless each of us does his best\\". As horrible as Nazi concentration camp is, Frankl lived to tell the story, to share his experience. All those who died did not die in vain. Ultimately goodness and justice, and human spirits triumph in this world.nique way.     The bare truth of concentration camp, the honesty and the compassion deeply touches me.

B003QNXPUK|5.0|I bought this for my new phone because I had one for my old Iphone and just loved it. The things that recommend this screen over similar products are its quality, durability, and ease of cleaning.<br />The only negative is the cumbersome installation. After thoroughly wiping the surface of the phone with a lint free rag and insuring that there is no dust or irksome things like fingerprints, you have to spray the Zagg screens and your clean hands with the spray solution supplied. Next step is to align the screens to the surface. After this is done, you use a squegee that is supplied to remove all bubbles and imperfections that are the result of the bonding process. Rub, rub, rub with that squegee and eventually you are done. The only maintance that is performed is a periodic once over with a lint free rag to keep it clean and pretty.<br />The sields won't go anywhere and it offers great protection in the most vulnerable areas on your phone.<br />This is a good product and a smart investment for a pricey electronic device.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|The changes made, that are detailed ad nauseum by other reviewers, make no sense.<br /><br />Seriously, I have seen a thousand movies recut by the directors and there was always some rationale.  This time? They don't add any value or correct any story telling or do any context shifts or anything that recuts usually offer. They are just fodder for internet memes and bad jokes.<br /><br />It's pretty sad. Maybe someone could convince Lucas to let Criterion curate some really nice original copies, I bet they would sell even at criterion collection overpricing!<br /><br />I'm just glad I'm not a Star Wars fanatic. I'm sure those guys are really hurting right now.
0385534639|5.0|Le Cirque des Reves, the Circus of Dreams, is not like any ordinary circus you've ever seen.  It's magical - full of illusions and everything mystical, and it happens only at night.  The story has a bit of mystery and a non-traditional romance mixed in with all of the magic, which makes for an unusual yet memorable read.<br /><br />The story jumps around in time a bit, but for the most part takes place in the late 1800s early 1900s. It's a pretty simple story actually. Celia, was left at the age of 5 at the home of her biological father Prospero (the Enchanter), along with a suicide note from the girl's mother.  Prospero, early on notices his daughter's special magical qualities and begins grooming her with hours and hours of training, believing that some day she will be able to compete and win the circus competitions.  Alexander (the Man in the Gray Suit) is Prospero's nemesis. He goes to the orphanage and adopts young, Marco who he believes, for his own selfish interest,  is the perfect child to groom for competitions as well.<br /><br />When Celia and Marco begin to compete. They are fabulous and the crowds love them. As the competitions continue they begin to fall in love, and magical and beautiful symbols of their love begin to appear. Yet despite the new beauty their is sadness. Little do either know that they are pawns in a game designed by the men who taught them. When one finally wins, the other must die. To say more would be to spoil the story for prospective readers.<br /><br />Although I rarely read novels in the fantasy genre, I found this story amazing. It's so well written: very visual, very atmospheric and very magical.  I was amazed that this was a debut novel for Ms. Morgenstern; she will certainly be an author I plan to follow.  It was great to learn how the circus came to be, and I loved the way this novel made me feel after the final page was turned. This is one novel that I will be talking about to those who love something just a tad different. Try it!

1936719118|5.0|Okay, so every once in a while I run across a book I have to share with someone. This is a book I feel like I have to share with EVERYone. And then after they read it, they are quickly trying to share it around. My copy is currently making the rounds at my neice's bank.<br /><br />What I loved second-most about this book was watching a small business grow from a helpful idea to a full-blown success before my very eyes, not unlike time lapse photography. A business like any of us might have started or fancied. And pursued like any of us might do or are doing, with some subtle yet powerful differences. That is what makes this book so shareable - it has all our stories and the stories of people we know played out, but with fun solutions and \\"wouldn't it be great if\\" done for real, and succeeding.<br /><br />What I loved most about this book however was Derek. I loved his practical approach based on principles rather than business degrees, his willingness to just do what makes sense, and you gotta love his putting the customer so far ahead of the notion of profit that the profits come (eventually) as an avalanche.<br /><br />Great read, and you won't be keeping your copy, so be forewarned :)

B003DZX44I|5.0|I haven't seen this film for a long time until I recently ordered it on bluray. It's a nice looking film to begin with but it really presents wonderfully on bluray. The dance scene is stunningly beautiful, just like when we saw the film for the first time at the theater. The discs all played without issue. There's 3 discs total, 2 are BD, the film on one and bonus materials on the other and 1 DVD version of the feature. The DVD is great if you don't have a bluray in your car or if you have kids because your bd copy will be handled less and won't get scratched. There are 2 \\"never-before-seen\\" items, an alternate opening & a new deleted scene, as well as a sing along mode. Of course the songs are great and the \\"tale as old as time\\" is nicely told. Love all the characters too! And if you ever want to see Beast's library in real life you can always go to DCA and get a glimpse! The rose is awesome! If you are a Disney Movie Rewards member you will also get points for registering this film. Lots of bonus goodies you will be sure to enjoy. Hope this helps.
B005DZMODI|4.0|I'm not usually a big Eric Clapton fan, and even though Wynton Marsalis is a phenomenal trumpet player, sometimes he comes off to me as too clinical and he doesn't \\"swing.\\" Rest assured, both of those preconceptions go out the door in this concert recording.    First off, the music on this concert CD consists of old-school blues played in a jazz/Dixieland style. While I wasn't familiar with many of the songs, the interpretations really work and allow all of the various instruments to be showcased at one time or another - trumpet, clarinet, piano, banjo, trombone, drums. Every now and then you can hear a Clapton electric guitar riff and only once or twice does it seem out of place. Layla is reworked as a Dixieland dirge with a plodding tempo and, man does it work that way.     You can tell right away that these guys are having a BLAST. It really shows in the playing, which is masterful. And effortless. At times you think these guys just hooked up for a jam session, and then you listen to some unison/harmonized horn runs and realize the technical proficiency on display. Not one note is out of place.    In addition, this is a really hot recording. It seems like microphones were placed midway between the crowd and the band and turned all the way up so every little sound in the room is picked up. It really makes you feel imbedded in the concert and adds to the feel. And the acoustic horn and percussion instruments blend together exceptionally. It reminds me of being in Preservation Hall in New Orleans.    So all I can say is that the musicianship on here is incredible and the CD is a lot of fun. If you like Dixieland-based jazz arrangements, you will really enjoy this.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I purchased this headset at gamestop about a year ago and they were probably the best headphones I have ever had, but recently the little adapter to the xbox 360 controller started failing. So, I looked it up online to find a replacement and sure enough they sell one for 6.99. But then the frame broke (keep in mind that I am extremely careful with all of my electronics)... the left earpiece with the mic broke off and only one remains. Also, the bass doesn't work too well. It's decent, and the wires get tangled really easily. Plus if you have a charger for your xbox controller it does some hissing sound which is really annoying. But as far as sound quality it does the job for call of duty and I like the fact that it works with PC and my XBOX 360.    Pros: Great sound (while it lasted), inexpensive, cross gaming (pc,ps3,xbox 360)    Cons: Cheap plastic frame, decent bass, wires are too long, adapter ruins easily for xbox

B005974CNA|5.0|My first listen through I felt some songs did not grab on to me.  For some reason I felt jumbled and overwhelmed.  I didn't feel that way when I first listened to BCSL.  After a full second listen through and realizing that some of these songs have some great moments, I have begun to change my mind.  There is a lot to this album that requires way more than just 2 or 3 listens.  Bridges in the Sky is a great song, and Breaking All Illusions has some amazing instrumental parts to it.  It seems every song needs at least 4 or 5 listens to really grab on to it (except for This is the Life..which I felt has such an addictive guitar part from the get go) and Beneath the Surface has to be one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. I could not believe the lyrics the first time I heard it.         All in all, I think I will be spinning this one for a long time.  BCSL has literally been in my car since I got it in 2009 and just replaced it with ADTOE. Im sure ADTOE will be spinning in my car until the next CD arrives.          I feel Rudess really stands out on this one, offering up new sounds and not sitting there playing exactly what Petrucci plays.  Same goes for Myung, who I'm pretty sure I haven't heard since Octavarium or even before that.  Its great to see everyone playing what they want and being heard well.

1612130585|5.0|As promised Christian and Anastasia resume their relationship after a brief interruption. The emotions between the two become more and more intense. I became so wrapped up in these characters that I felt I was that fly on the wall you always hope you could be. I watched them laugh & cry and I laughed and cried with them. I watched them be angry with one another & forgive one another and I would get angry at both of them for being so ridiculous at times. E L James took me someplace emotionally I only imagined ever existed. Her descriptions of how Christian and Ana feel for one another pulls you into the story.<br /><br />It was hard for me to put this book down and I can't wait to get my hands on Book 3.

I can't put in writing how awesome these books are. There are so many plot twists and no way to predict what is coming. Just when you believe something is true something happens and you can't be sure what's about to happen. This book continues from when the Gladers were rescued, when they wake up in the dorm of the rescuers. I don't want to get too into it to give anything away, but this is a MUST read! I loved it! OMG! I still can't form complex thoughts. That book. . . wow. That's really all I can say. Wow. Just Wow.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I wanted to get myself toned up and in shape. Jillian does exactly that. At first I didn't think it would be hard but by the end I was sweating and could feel the burn. Only problem I had was with doing the crunches. Ended up hurting my tailbone because I should've been on something softer. Not her fault but just want to put out there make sure you have the right cushioning when doing those.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These are the best full size headphones I've ever seen for under $100. I've never used very high-end equipment before, but these are, by far, the best sounding headphones I've ever owned. The bass won't blow you away, but it is very realistic and clean sounding. When I first started using them I found the highs to be a little bit harsh, but after some break in they have come down to normal levels.<br /><br />I'm not an audiophile, but I do have a head and I have got to tell you: These are THE most comfortable pair of headphones that I have ever put on my head. The ear cups seem to be made of real leather, but I may be wrong (at the very least it seems like real leather). They are large and fit easily around my average-sized ears. I've worn them for five hours at a time without much discomfort. The headband adjusts to your head size as soon as you put it on. Amazing.<br /><br />I like the design. It's not great, but it's not bad. The red rings are not nearly as vibrant in real life. They're more of a nice, mellow maroon, really. The 60mm drivers take a lot of juice to drive. I need to put my iPod Touch at about 70% to get a decent volume (Sansa Clip users beware!).<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend these enough. Especially at this price.
B005974CNA|5.0|An excellent album, still having the fundamentals that makes Dream Theater, Dream Theater.  The production quality on this album, in my opinion, is one of the better ones, especially when compared to some of the recent work. James' vocals shine very well on this album.  Very glad to hear them again!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Films are not finished but abandoned, and it's an arrogance to re-edit a lauded series of films long after their release. Effects that were cutting edge for their time but now dated are preferable to CGI anachronisms, and stories told within constraints are more compelling than wedged-in retrospective canon.    One star for giving us a case study in how second-guessing and one-upping slaughters creativity and innovation.
B00000IMTG|5.0|5 stars simply because they won't let me give it 10 stars... I had this on vinyl back in the day and believe me, if you have any doubt as to the sheer brilliance that was Dio-era Rainbow, GET THIS NOW.  Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio(R.I.P.) were one of the greatest hard rock duos in the history of the genre.  PERIOD.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|Fortunately I read the instruction very carefully! The instruction says that I you plan to put on and take off the Zoom frequently, then use the provided clear plastic sticker on Kinect sensor lenses. I was planning on using the Zoom permanently, but I still used the clear sticker. That saved my Kinect because I had to put on and take off the Zoom to run many trial and error procedures to see if I can get the Zoom to work. But nothing helped and I ended up returning the Zoom only few hours after receiving the shipment. If you want to try this product, I suggest that you follow the instruction and use the clear plastic sticker to protect your Kinect. Otherwise you may end up with a scratched Kinect sensor, just like many other first days buyers here in Amazon.    I took care to properly align the Zoom lenses with the Kinect Sensor lenses. After putting on the Zoom, I first calibrated the Kinect Sensor with the Spectacle Calibration card. Then I went and used other tuning steps on Kinect Tuner. I have my sensor wall mounted. In that position, Kinect cannot see the floor with Zoom. But it sees the floor clearly without Zoom. To accommodate the Zoom, I took the sensor from the Wall mount and placed it under the TV. In this position it sees the floor. This is the only success that I got with Zoom. Nothing else worked. It cannot see the player in any position- wall mounted or under the TV. The little camera view on the lower right corner just shows a dark screen. I turned on lights even during the day to light up my living room. But it still showed dark screen. Since I failed to get the Kinect to work with the Zoom, I then skipped all the tuning part and tried to play game without tuning the sensor. First I tried, Fruit Ninja Arcade game. It does not even let me start the game. I get a warning message that Kinect cannot see. I tried Kinect Sports, but I was not able to cross the game menu because the sensor was not able to follow my hand movement on menu selection.    SoI ended up taking the Zoom off and placed the Kinect back on its wall mounted position. I am back to my perfectly working Kinect. I have large space on my living room and so I can play perfectly without the Zoom. I had to relocate my Sofa to a different position to make room for 2-player space. I purchased the Zoom so that I can bring the Sofa back to its original position. But the Nyko Zoom turned out to be a failed project and worthless wait of couple of months for this product.

1400069181|5.0|Blake Mycoskie's self-help book \\"Start Something That Matters\\" shows how to combine a for-profit company with a social mission. His book uses the story of TOMS his successful for-profit shoe company as a blueprint to show and inspire others to start something that matters.<br />While traveling in Argentina (South America) in 2006 Blake met a woman who belonged to an organization that collected shoes from donors to give to impoverished kids. When Blake witnessed the blisters, sores and infections on the children's bare feet the idea came to him to create a for-profit shoe company with a social mission. He created a new version of \\"alpargata\\" Argentina's comfortable, casual, canvas shoe and for every pair of shoes his company sold he pledged to donate a pair of shoes to a needy child. He named his company TOMS (a promise for a better tomorrow). Blake has fulfilled his promise. TOMS has given more than a million pairs of shoes to children in need the past five years.<br />There are seven themes in Blake's self-help book: find your story, face your fears, be resourceful without resources, keep it simple, build trust, giving is good business and the final step which is moving from thinking about doing something to actually doing it.<br />To find your passion and mission in life Blake offers three questions: \\"If you did not have to<br /> worry about money, what would you do with your time? What kind of work do you want to do? What cause would you like to serve?\\"<br />Blake's story is changing the definition of success. He says the quest for success is not the same as the quest for status and money. The definition has broadened to include contributing something to the world. He says TOMS is a success precisely because they created a new model. The giving component of TOMS makes their shoes more than a product. They're part of a story, a mission and a movement anyone can join.<br />Blake also shares the stories of other people who started something that matters. Their stories show how we can make a living, have the time and freedom to do the things we love and contribute to making the world a better place.n make a living, have the time and freedom to do the things we love and contribute to making the world a better place.
0307887960|5.0|Both my husband and myself have lost over 20 lbs on this diet. We both recommend this book to our friends and family. It takes you through 4 phases until you are at your desired weight and can keep it off permanetly, as the book promises. We are about to start our third phase of the diet and look forward to including more choices in our everyday meal plan. This is a diet that requires the dieter to cook most of your own meals and drink plenty of water each day, as well as including 20-30mins of walking per day or some type of exercise. You will see results if you follow the book as it describes. For us the plan become easier and easier to follow as the weeks went by and we are excited and motovated evey time we step on the scale. Althoght we did not have a lot to loose to get to our goal weight we feel this diet can work well for those who do just as well as it has worked for us. Some of my work colleagues have also started the Dukan diet and have had success in doing so. Others I work with have had their interest peeked and are looking foward to buying this book and reading it for themselves.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|High School of the Dead: Complete Collection [Blu-Ray]   First saw this show online and loved it. Zombies, school girls, blood, gore and even a story with character developement.  WOW!!! e fan service is fun and there is alot ofd it but nothing too bad. On the video part, there is  alot of difference between, a computer screen, normal CRT and A HDTV. The colores sare sharp, the detail really good and the Blu-Ray was even better than the regular DVD. Now those on a budget and want to buy this one, The DVD is al most as good as the Blu-Ray. So save a couple of bucks, but if you have the xtra money, go Blu-Ray.  ok, extras are on the short side.....
B000JIHP88|5.0|My baby just loves this mobile.  He first started to really notice it at about 3 weeks or so, and it's still a hit at 8 weeks.  We'll lay him in his crib to change his clothes, and he'll just stare at it in fascination.  He'll be so involved that we often just leave him there, where he kicks his legs and moves his arms and \\"speaks\\" to it.  It occupies him on average for about 20 minutes.  From my own perspective, I just love the colors and the animals.  They're so happy and lively.  The underside of the green, flapping leaves is an iridescent green (which adults may not notice, unless they bend over to see it from the angle of the baby.) These fabric leaves almost haphazardly flap (by design) but always manage to not mess anything up.  They often tap the animals, and help the movement seem a little more lively.  Regarding the music, I suspect it's great for the baby, but I find the songs to be a little slow and monotone for my taste. (Slower and less lively than the actual versions of the Bach/Beethoven/Mozart songs.) Thankfully, there is also a nature sounds option, which I usually choose.<br /><br />EDIT<br />My baby is now 23-months and he still loves this mobile, but now HE gets to be in charge of it since he can push the buttons.  It's basically part of his crib toys now.  Some reviewers complained that this eats batteries, but I've seen the exact opposite.  In 23 months (of almost daily use), I've had to change the batteries twice.  Also, when the batteries run down, the mobile moves really slowly, so there's nothing physically wrong with the mobile.  New batteries fix that problem immediately.
B004EPYZXU|5.0|I watched this movie at the theater last night. I like science fiction movies and \\"found footage movies\\" a lot. This movie, given its alleged low budget, is really well made. It looks as if you were watching an authentic recording of a moon mission gone very wrong. As everyone at this point knows, these movie endings are never good for the characters involved, and anyone expecting otherwise should not even bother to watch them.  I give this movie five stars because I really inmersed myself in the plot. The dark, isiolated, barren moonscape is incredibly well made, as well as the spaceships visual details and sounds. The acting was excellent, and the moon creatures convincing.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|After seeing this product demoed on E3 coverages, I immediately put in a pre-order for the Zoom. After receiving the product, I mounted it on the Kinect as shown in the directions. Like other reviewers, I had issues with the Kinect not being able to see the floor with no prior issues before using the Zoom. I initially had the Kinect mounted on a shelf above my TV, tried it on top of the TV, and finally got it to work properly on the TV stand (below the TV) after tuning the Kinect through the options menu. After properly setting it up, the device worked great with the games I've tried (Dance Central, Kinectamals, Kinect Adventures!, Fruit Ninja, and Kinect Sports).
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|this is one of the greatest movies ever made, great story and great actors. this movie rocks. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do
B005D0TETA|5.0|The criticism on the presence of animations during the concert is very exaggerate when you considering that it only takes a few seconds each time. I know it's better to have the option to remove them, like the DVD, but this detail should not stop everyone to buy this upgrade version. The sound on DTS_HD is excellent and so the picture. You can see many details that you have not seen in the DVD. But the main concert is so amazing with a killer set-list that contains 4 epics. The addition of a orchestra to the symphonic music of Yes is right on the button, and here it's not your usual orchestra. These are young musicians that show a lot of enthusiam during the performance.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|If you liked the original movies, you are not going to like this.  Re mastering special effects? sure thing, whatever.  But changing the characters themselves? that changes the movie.  If this is Lucas vision on the movies, then he is lucky the original deviated so much from it.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|this is an awesome movie. i thought that 5the story and the actors were great one of brad pitt's best performance.  this is a must see. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do
B003UESJH4|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and knew I would want a copy of my own. It arrived just as promised.  For those who love period pieces, historic pieces it is a must have. It explores the great friendship between two men and shows that royalty are when it comes down to it have much of their lives controlled by protocol.  The actors are well suited for their roles.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I like the cd so far but only time will tell.  It generally takes a little time before I love an album.  I like the last cd release and I know I like a couple of songs on this new one already.  Thanks!

B0050SYS5A|2.0|If you use your kinect in a well lit room on the edge of a desk that has a clear path to the floor it SHOULD work fine. I have my kinect wall mounted about 6 feet up because I do not have the shelf space and it's a piece of junk. I'd say buy from Amazon, test it if it works for you, and if it doesn't, return it. The hand tracking seems to be pretty crappy from what I used of it, but playing kinect sports bowling when it worked I saw more of the lane and had to do less exaggerated arm motions for bowling. I will play Dance Central with it this weekend and see how that works, but this seems to be a sort of accessory that is really good for some games, and really really bad for others, there really is no in between.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|In 1977 my brother and I, along with a couple of friends went across the bay to the Coronet theater to see Star Wars.  I was unimpressed at the time, having seen a couple of the silly trailers.  As we got closer to the theater - still some blocks away - I noticed these looooong lines, and discovered that they went off in 2 directions, and ended (or began) at the theater, and that we were going to be at the end of one of those looooong lines.  At that time I had to reevaluate the purpose of my being there.      1st - I was stranded; I either had to endure the line or find an alternate way home.     2nd - Since these people were obviously in line to see the same movie (this was in the days before the multiplex cinemas), what was so special about it that they would endure such an excruciating wait?    3rd - Did I really want to spend the rest of the day standing in line in San Francisco to see a movie that looked so silly?    As it turned out, of course I stood in line, and was shocked to discover that everybody in that line, including me, made it into the next showing, and the excitement in that theater when the lights dimmed, the curtains opened, the 20th Century Fox fanfare blared, to be followed by absolute silence, was almost unbearable.  Then the simple blue \\"a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\\" intro, and the crowd became almost ecstatic.  Of course, then the \\"Star Wars\\" Crawl.  Keep in mind that this was NOT \\"Episode IV.\\"  It was simply called \\"Star Wars.\\"  Everybody laughed out loud at the antics of C3PO and R2D2, booed and hissed the first time they saw Darth Vader, and were totally caught up in the movie.  Many stayed to watch as the curtain finally closed, then went outside, and GOT RIGHT BACK INTO LINE AGAIN!  And, I was one of them!  Over the next 3 years I saw the movie some 20 times, and countless times since then on video or TV.    Then, Star Wars became \\"Episode IV: A New Hope.\\"  \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" came out - deeper, darker, but not as stimulating as the original.  \\"Return Of The Jedi\\" came out in 1983, which closed the book on the Luke Skywalker saga.  If Lucas had left the originals alone, maybe just tweak a scene here or there (like removing the vaseline \\"forcefield\\" effect of the speeder in the first film), then I'm sure that nobody would have minded his re-edits.  But, once he had his hand in digital effects, he altered the entire series.     Then, The Darth Vader saga was released (\\"The Phantom Menace\\", \\"Attack of The Clones,\\" and \\"Revenge Of The Sith,\\" and the whole premise of the entire franchise shifted to focus on Vader's life and redemption.  Not to mention that the last three were a shadow of the originals, and the \\"answers\\" that were provided to explain events that had unfolded in the \\"Luke\\" saga caused those of us particularly familiar with those questions (e.g. when Luke asks Leia about her mother in ROTJ, or Ben tells Luke that Luke's father wanted his son to have his lightsabre in ANH), that Lucas was just \\"mailing it in.\\"  George Lucas had abandoned his original audience in favor of a dumber group who only wanted to see battles with lightsabres and blasters, and was completely unconcerned with the story.    Still he tweaked, released the original 3 in a VHS package, then a few years ago a dvd package.  I dutifully bought those, along with the individual dvds of each of the Darth Vader saga as they were released.  I saw Han Solo reduced from the rogue character he initially was to being merely a pilot with some fighting skills.  I met a \\"younger\\" Jabba that failed to move the story along.  There was also additional backgrounds and characters, even some characters that had been replaced.  Even Darth Vader's likeness was changed.    Now, with this new package, which I've had added to my cart since it was announced, I'm being told that there are even more changes made, and none seem to be improvements.  I want to see the same movies I went to see at the theater.  Those were art - even thenewer ones still had some value.  If GL wants to make real money then he could sell the originals in all their Blu-Ray ORIGINAL glory (adding the additional footage, digital enhancements, etc as additional items), and continue to sell this package - which is what this review is supposed to be about) separately.  As it stands, I've REMOVED the set from my cart, and refuse to buy it.      Mr Lucas, I only hope you read this, but I doubt that you will.  Maybe others will - and use their wallets to make a statement.
0062060554|5.0|Since the story has been told in other reviews, I'll simply say that this is one of the best books I have  ever read. I will be shocked if it doesn't take every award. I plan to give it to several people on my  Christmas list. Don't miss this.
1594744769|5.0|This was an amazing book. I highly recommend it! From the first page Ransom Riggs pulls you into the story. Although it is written from the standpoint of a 17 year old boy it makes no difference as the character's thoughts are universal to anyone in that situation. An easy read as it is well written and moves at a quick pace (hard to put down most of the time). Looking forward to the author writing again.
B000PMG16U|5.0|I love The Phantom Menace. There. My secret's out.    Saying that feels like saying I love Al-Qaeda or I love NAMBLA. On the Internet, hate for George Lucas has surpassed that of Osama Bin-Laden with the recent decision to yet again alter the Star Wars Saga for the upcoming Blu-Ray release. The controversy between the Lucas \\"apologists\\" and the Star Wars \\"purists\\" brings to mind Catholic and Protestant, Muslim and Hindu, Scientist and Creationist; the same deep seated convictions stir in the hearts and minds of these two groups of fans. Never mind the global economic crisis, the revolutions taking place throughout the Islamic world, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this is STAR WARS! That anyone should care so deeply about a movie is unquestionably absurd, but I find myself inexplicably drawn to this controversy. I can't help but feel angry by this hatred for a filmmaker who has given so much imagination to so many. After all, don't these people know that hatred leads to the Dark Side?    For die hard fans, no thinking person over the age of eight can enjoy The Phantom Menace. Not a year goes by that I don't come across a comic or an article taking pot shots at the prequel trilogy. The article doesn't even have to be about Star Wars yet somehow the reference is thrown out, as though we must never forget the lasting psychological wounds of so many raped childhoods. The epic failure of Episodes I, II and III has become legendary and is repeated in the media like a mantra. There is even a \\"fan\\" film depicting an 80's George Lucas being kidnapped and replaced by an evil clone, as if the \\"real\\" Lucas could never have made something as terrible as the prequel trilogy. Even suggesting that these movies might not be that bad is to be suffering from Lucas Stockholm Syndrome.    But wait. Something isn't right here. How could a movie, any movie, even one as beloved as Star Wars, spawn such hatred? It's just this kind of zealotry that gets my undies in a bunch. Since leavingthe Baptist School where I was hammered with the unerring truth of the Bible for almost a decade, I've spent my life challenging the status-quo, playing Devil's Advocate whenever prudent. For me, there is something inherently dangerous about accepting opinions as fact. The more the critics jump on the Lucas bashing bandwagon, the more I see a lynch mob.    In 1999, before The Phantom Menace hit theaters, I was not a big fan of Star Wars. I had the movies on VHS and I think I watched them once or twice. I owned none of the toys or books or posters, but the trailer for Episode I brought wonderful memories: from Thanksgiving Day, 1980, when I rode on the back of my friend's dirt bike to see The Empire Strikes Back, to the afternoon in 1983 when my sister and I waited in a line that wrapped around the theater for Return of the Jedi. Nostalgia got me excited about Episode I like no movie could; after all, it wasn't just a movie, it was a cultural event. One week before the release, I waited hours with a hundred or so people pining for the lost wonder of childhood. We listened to John Williams' symphony blasted from parked cars and relished talking about things too geeky for everyday society. I was 24 and I still felt young enough to be excited about something as trivial as a movie.    The Phantom Menace made me a kid again. I didn't look for clever dialogue or Oscar worthy performances here. I wanted spaceships and aliens and cool looking planets and awesome light-saber fights and things that went KABOOM! and Lucas delivered it in spades; I wanted all the guilty pleasures that \\"mature\\" movies couldn't offer or that my adult sensibilities never afforded me. After the film, I remember my brother liking it (not a fan), my friend and I loving it, and my four year old nephew really loving it. A Marine and fellow coworker told me, \\"Now I want to be a Jedi\\". Even the critics on Rotten Tomatoes gave it a certified 61% Fresh rating. So, at the time, there was no inkling of the hatred the movie would later spawn.    More than a decade later, a YouTube critic would say that Lucas' script for The Phantom Menace was written by an eight year old. But it's precisely that childhood exuberance and unchecked imagination that makes me love George. It's every kid's dream come true: a billion dollars in toys! How can you not enjoy watching him play? In 2005, after the credits rolled on Revenge of the Sith, something changed in me. I knew I had become more cynical, more jaded. Having a mortgage and two kids will do that to you. I knew that I would never again wait with such eager anticipation for a movie; it's one thing to enjoy a film and quite another to count the days on your calendar, wishing time could move faster. Perhaps if I had been a little older in 1999, 34 instead of 24, I might have understood the disappointment.    I have always insisted that the hatred for the prequel trilogy has more to do with aging and less to do with the actual films. Let's be honest here: Star Wars meant more to the people growing up in the 70's and 80's than any other generation. My father, who is 78, never goes to the theater anymore because they don't make good movies like The Sound of Music or Casablanca. I know a guy in his fifties who loves The Day the Earth Stood Still and Forbidden Planet, but never cared for Star Wars. I know teenagers who have never seen, or even care to watch, Star Wars. And I also know kids who adore the prequels. So is it really Lucas that's changed so much, or is it us? Is our hatred for him really a hatred for growing up? No prequel could have delivered the experience of watching the original Star Wars as a child. In the re-release, critics found flaws in the changes, but never the first cut of the films. But if we were to scrutinize every scene in the original with the same harsh treatment as the prequels, we could find much to gripe about. For instance: it never made sense to me how the Death Star suddenly appears at Yavin IV, or why, if it can move, it doesn't just fly around the moon and blow it up. The Empire Strikes Back, heralded as the best in the saga, is also the most flawed: it never seems credible that Luke was Leia's brother all along, Han could never have survived in the vacuum of that giant worm's stomach, and Yoda continuously contradicts himself when he describes the limitless power of the Force. Size matters not, but turning 900 years old, apparently, makes you useless. But in the rosy tint of childhood, the original Star Wars remains flawless. How could any movie compare with such nostalgia? With expectations bordering on religious ecstasy, the prequels were doomed to be hated, just as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. In contrast, casual fans seem to love the prequels, as DVD and Blu-Ray sales have proved time and again.    The Phantom Menace is far from a perfect movie, but then again, I have never seen a perfect movie. I have never accepted the notion that art should be perfect. Should writers and painters and directors think like mathematicians and diamond cutters? Should they be so careful that they never dare throw out their most unorthodox ideas lest people think them inane or offensive? I love The Phantom Menace not despite its flaws but because of them. I love that we become passionate about art, one way or another, that we find ourselves hotly debating changes to a film decades after its inception, on whether it is a crime against art or simply another expression of it; I love that we wonder whether words like YIPEE are cringe-worthy or just a sign of the times; I love that we consider racial stereotyping in an alien species; I love that we debate the physical aspect (midichlorians) of a spiritual belief system (the Force). What other movie comes close to rousing such passions? None. By a long shot.    This review reposted from [...]
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Matt Smith has the right qualities to play the new Doctor. I have to admit to being skeptical at first because of his young age, however after watching the first season I was very impressed with his portrayal of the Doctor and feel that the franchise is in good hands.<br />  I like to think I'm kind of an expert in this matter since I've watched the show my whole life. My first experience watching Doctor Who was in the 80s specifically when Tom Baker was finishing up his run in the roll. I remember being disappointed when Peter Davidson took on the roll thinking he was just too different from Tom Baker, but as I got older I came to appreciate his take on the Doctor and even came to like it. So whether the Doctor is portrayed a bit silly or a bit more serious it makes the character more interesting. The only actor to play the Doctor so far that I thought didn't do a good job with the roll was Colin Baker the 7th Doctor. I thought he portrayed the Doctor with too much of an air of arrogance and lacked the humility towards the universe and all that's in it that makes the Doctor the Doctor. So hopefully when they pick what by cannon is the 12th and last Doctor they continue to make the good choices they've made recently. And even though Matt is great I hope next time they try going a little older just so those of us that grew up on Doctor don't feel so left behind.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|Sadly, it it only works with some games. If the game requires a floor check you can pretty much forget about this even in a well lit room with a tight edge. I have tried this in three different configurations and it allays goes back to fail state even if you can trick it into working. the odd thing is that the camera is clearly seeing the floor and profiles fine yet the software can't parse the the perspective shift.<br /><br />EDIT: Ok it seems there is a bug with the OS or just some some games that cause the kinect with zoom to enter a weird state were the camera can see only dark. Taking the lens off dose not correct, only resetting the xbox. A lot of people are reporting on this. Kinect sports seems to offten toss the game into this mode. Reset try again seems to fix.

She was very happy to be able to have treats that didn't interfer with her allergy. I'm sure she will enjoy this book too when I gift it to her.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The biggest omission here is obviously the '77, '80 & '83 Theatrical versions of the Original Trilogy (the 1997 theatrical and 2004 video versions aren't included either, if anyone cares), but there are a lot of deleted scenes still in the vault that disappointingly aren't included here, nor is the Star Wars Holiday Special, nor the documentary \\"From Star Wars To Jedi: The Making Of A Saga\\" nor is the documentary \\"Empire Of Dreams\\" which was included with the 2004 DVD set. The theatrical trailers from the '04 DVDs are missing as well. Hopefully the NEXT blu-ray release will include all of the above.

1612130283|5.0|Christian Grey is the classic tortured soul that every girl would love to heal - but EL James doesn't make it easy for her heroine, or us.  Her hero Christian Grey has plenty of redeeming qualities on the surface, but his secrets are truly terrifying and challenging.  Ana's a great heroine, young and inexperienced, but not naive, and we sense she has a core of steel.  We really believe she might succeed in humanising this intimidating, masterful man where all the women who went before her have failed.  An addictive, engrossing, steamy romantic yarn.
B004G600A4|2.0|Buying movies from Amazon are hit or miss. I go out of my way to buy them new and sometimes they have the security sticker that you get in new movies and sometimes they don't. They are always rapped but this particular dvd had no security sticker over the opening so it makes it look cheaper and not new in my opinion. Especially when you give it as a gift.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Runs smoothly enough but really basic, same few-year-old game with no additional, updates are lacking as the android version still does not have the zen garden or minigames the iOS port has had for a few months now and the standardvgame gets old fast considering i've already played through the exact same thing on pc quite some time ago. Good classic game to waste some time on, disappointing lack of updates/support.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I purchased this for my grandchildren to watch when at my house.  They are absolutely in love with it and I must admit I haven't gotten tired of it yet.  You can't go wrong with this movie.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have to say, all the complaining about the Blu Ray version of the Star Wars saga has really opened my eyes to how ignorant Fanboys are.    Don't get me wrong, I geek out about Star Wars probably more than they do, and I'm also not a sucker. That being said, fanboys need to take it down a few notches over this release. It's misleading to the people actually interested in buying this collection. If you have a problem with this release DON'T BUY IT! If you'd rather wait to see if Lucasfilm puts out another version or six of this -- then WAIT!    It's pretty ridiculous that you take something you claim to love so dearly for granted. I was alive and comprehensive when Lucas put out all the different DVD versions and guess what -- I'M NOT DEAD! And guess what else -- I had my version from 2004 and I decided I didn't need the new versions so -- I DIDN'T BUY THEM!!!    It doesn't take  a Star Trek fan to put together this simple equation: A(I have a version of the Star Wars saga I like) + B(I don't need a newer version) x C(A newer version of Star Wars) = I DON'T NEED IT SO I WON'T BUY IT.    Although it is ignorant of me to assume fanboys with nothing better to do WOULDN'T take precious time out of their day and reserve it to lampooning Lucas, Lucasfilm and Star Wars because, in true Shakespearian fashion, they don't have what Lucas has and are denying his attempt to profit off them.    Here's an easy way to stick it to Lucas...DON'T GIVE HIM YOUR MONEY!!    It flabbergasts me that something you can claim to love so much is taken for granted and rejected so violently. Just get it together and chill out. I'm not a Lucas apologist, I don't work for Lucasfilm or 20th Century, I love Star Wars and I will protect that even if it means taking on parasites from the inside.     For the record: None of the majority of the Original Trilogy specs that appear on the disc have been released before. Never has the saga been available in HD picture quality or sound quality for keeps (Iam aware they aired on Spike in HD but you can't record in Blu Ray quality, at least not this quality). Most of the specs are new and boo-hoo if Lucas fixed some more things. You're honestly telling me if you could go back and correct your past mistakes and the worst that would happen is you piss off fanboys, you wouldn't?    That's true ignorance. Look at the flip side of the coin folks, and just shut up and enjoy Star Wars. It's a freaking film saga, and no one is mandating you go out and buy this. I'm not criticizing your freedom of speech, I'm using mine and saying they way you're going about exercising your right is stupid, foolish, ignorant and a poor reflection on the true Star Wars fans out there.    Get it together!
0811874192|5.0|I work with patients in a very restricted environment with a view to enriching their experience with music, poetry, and graphic images, and  enhance their motivation and capacity to recover and heal.  This has been a very successful addition to my materials in a setting where I cannot use real plants and flowers.  It is intriguing, ingenious, and reasonably realistic. Even macho men find the paper sculptures engaging and enjoy looking at them. The book is reasonably sturdy as pop-up books go, but obviously cannot be given into the hands of children, or adults who are in dementia or delirium, without supervision.  With supervision the bouquets are capable of diverting and even delighting patients of many different ages with a wide variety of diagnoses. The book can lie flat on a table supporting its own sculptures or can be used on one's lap.  It can be used to trigger reminiscences and fantasies about nature, social occasions, meals, weddings, and much else with a little prompting and encouragement.  I have found it useful and delightful.  And its therapeutic utility does not in the least detract from its value as a nice coffee table item!
B004XE0P5E|5.0|I really love this album. At first, I was a little put off by how different this album was from the first \\"For Emma\\" album, but after listening to it more and more, I really began to love it. Now, I can't stop listening to it! It's by far my favorite album now. While there aren't any fast songs to mix it up, every song really had it's own unique sound and character, which help to prevent every song from sounding the same. I suggest you listen to the songs in order instead of on shuffle, they blend and flow in with each other seamlessly that way.

B005E7AOHI|3.0|I was really impressed when Primus first hit the scene in the early late 80s with Suck on This.  In a time of formulaic hair bands and made for MTV pop groups., Primus was a relief. The \\"Frizzle Fry\\" and \\"Sailing The Seas of Cheese\\" albums were musically adventurous to say the least.  Since \\"Cheese\\", Primus has released four CD's, two which I loved (Tales from the Punchbowl\\" and \\"Anti-Pop\\") and two I hated (\\"Pork Soda\\" and \\"The Brown Album\\").  This one falls somewhere in the middle.  The musicianship is first rate, no denying.  As far as the songs themselves, the band really breaks no new ground.  As a matter of fact some songs sound very similar to the older songs.  If any other band had recorded \\"Last Salmon Man\\" I would have called it a blatant rip-off of \\"Here Come The Bastids\\" from Cheese.  My other beef here is that Les Claypool's vocals are processed on far too many songs.  One would have been find.  Two would have been pushing.      Final thought - This is not bands finest moment nor is it a travesty.  While I am sure those who think Claypool can do no wrong will love it, some Primus fans may not feel the same with \\"Green Naugahyde\\".
B002ZG99QS|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Although the original \\"Tron\\" was a somewhat inexplicable box office failure when it was released in 1982, the film still managed to enter sci-fi lore as a prescient and visionary work that both exploited our then-burgeoning obsession with cybernetics and paved the way for the CGI era of moviemaking that was to come.  All of which means that any modern remake of the film is going to have to seem just as cutting-edge as the original in a time when eye-popping computer-generated special effects have become the rule rather than the exception - no easy task given the quality of its competition.  Now that technology has caught up with \\"Tron,\\" the question must be asked, can a new version of the film still manage to outpace the technology of its own time and present something never before seen at the local cineplex?<br /><br />Well, the answer is, it doesn't quite do so, but that doesn't keep the movie from being moderately entertaining on its own terms anyway.  While retaining the neon-lit visual schema of the original film, director Joseph Kosinski's \\"Tron: Legacy\\" does manage to ramp up the special effects with modern CGI technology - with a heavy emphasis on layered planes and geometric shapes to give this virtual world a circuit board look and feel.  The mood is also enhanced by the electronics-based score of Daft Punk.<br /><br />The story is essentially the same, as a human finds himself drawn into a video game and fighting for his life against the cybernetic forces that reside therein.  In this case, the human is Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), the twenty-seven-year-old son of Kevin Flynn, the man who invented the game (played by Jeff Bridges, the star of the original film) and who disappeared under mysterious circumstances in 1989 when Sam was still a lad.  Once inside the game, Sam discovers that his dad is as trapped as he is in this cyberspace alternate-reality.  As an added treat for an actor, Bridges gets to appear both as he is today, a grizzled older man, and as he was back when the original movie premiered, all courtesy of 21st Century CGI technology.<br /><br />And, as with the original \\"Tron,\\" the weakest elements of this film are indeed its storyline and characters, which don't stand a chance against all the visual razzmatazz that is the essence of such films.was back when the original movie premiered, all courtesy of 21st Century CGI technology.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|I am a CD guy, in spite of the trend toward only digital download.  I like to buy CDs, so I can check out ALL of the songs and see what I like.  I ordered the CD after hearing only the title track on the radio, which I loved.  Almost a year later, I still love that song.  The great part is that the rest of the CD does not disappoint.  Many great songs, some you will hear on the radio and others you should buy the CD to hear.
0307454886|3.0|Once again, the sex-obsessed Philip Roth doesn't disappoint.  Still, the man has a way with words, whether he's giving his protagonist's cynical views on marriage (\\"...like priests going into the church:  they take the vow of chastity....\\") or describing his lover Consuela's \\"aggressive yielding.\\"  David Kepesh is a 70-year-old divorced college professor who also has regular TV and NPR spots.  Thanks in part to his celebrity, he is able to strike up an affair with a female student at the end of every term.  Consuela, however, becomes his obsession, long after their break-up.  His son Kenny can't bear to repeat his father's sin of leaving their family, even though he's miserable in his own marriage. The irony of Kenny's martyrdom is one of the more interesting subplots.  He is leading a double life, keeping his marriage intact but at the same time cozying up to his mistress's parents.  Roth's female characters are seldom more than sex objects or featureless wives, but in this novel, Consuela and David both become infinitely more human at the end.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|I pre-ordered this unit and received it today.  Despite following the installation instructions exactly, my Kinect unit will not work properly with the Zoom attached.  More specifically, Kinect Tuner says it cannot find the floor, whether I put the Kinect on top of the TV, on the edge of the TV stand, or anywhere else.  It doesn't matter if I stand 4 feet away as instructed or 8 feet.  Kinect Sports won't start because of it.    Also, I was cautious in attaching and removing the Zoom unit, but it still left scratches on the face of the Kinect.  Luckily it didn't scratch the lenses, but I would definitely recommend attaching the optional plastic protector before trying this out.  I'm returning mine for a refund.
B0034G4P8A|2.0|I got this DVD (rather than the normal release) because it listed 'The Consultant' and bonus features as extras, which the normal DVD did not.    The issue I have is not the extras, because it had them.    The issue is that the extras are ONLY on Blue-Ray. ONLY. I don't have a Blue-ray player or a Blue-ray capable computer. I only bought this DVD set because of the extras, which I now cannot watch.    The pictures listed here are too small for me to see that the extras were only available on the Blue-Ray version. I'm very disappointed; had this seller listed that the extras were only available on one of the formats I never would have spent this much money on a DVD.
B005CMSDLE|2.0|I was excited to see HANNAH the moment I saw the trailer and was intrigued by the storyline immediately. Then there was Saoirse Ronan (Hannah), who has been a great young star. Not to mention, Cate Blanchett (Marissa) gasping as she watches through the one-way window as it is implied that Hannah has just skillfully ended the life of a woman who was posing as Blanchett's character, Marissa. Then of course Eric Banna rounding out an already interesting cast. So, imagine my disappointment when I found out that HANNAH wouldn't be coming to a theatre near me. In fact, it didn't even come to my STATE!! So, I had had to wait for the video. It finally was available in my town and I rushed to rent it, in fact, I almost bought the thing before seeing it. I was THAT pumped.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't buy it. Where do I start? The first thing that ruined the film for me was the overemphasis on artistic vision. Long drawn out shots and camera tricks and heartbeat sounds were all so overly done, I was rolling my eyes after about 25 minutes. All of this is signs of a Director who is trying way too hard to impress. Maybe that's because his first two films were highly praised and one, ATONEMENT, was showered with Oscars. The thing is, he didn't have to try so hard to impress. The story and the actors were good enough to do that, we didn't really have to have a camera that twisted completely 360 degrees while Hannah runs. Were we trying to cover up that most of the film is Hannah running? Maybe.<br /><br />The deep characters in HANNAH were never truly fleshed out. We could never actually say that we knew them. The camera spent the most time with HANNAH, and we sort of get to know her. Although, she is, believe it or not, the least interesting of the characters. She's basically a tool of her father. A killing machine, trained to right the wrongs and revenge the death of her mother, who she never met.<br /><br />Unfortunately for HANNAH, that is about as far as the depth goes in this movie. There are no twists and turns. There is running and there are sets that are so choreographed, I thought I was watching a Jackie Chan movie. Colorful duck boats lined in a row so that Hannah can jump across them. Did they have to be big obnoxious duck boats? Couldn't they be ordinary boats? Couldn't there have been a space between a couple of them so that she had to REALLY jump far to get across the water? Nope. Instead, as Hannah jumps, we spent the ten seconds looking at the boats, instead of focusing on Hannah.<br /><br />Not enough movie and too much director to enjoy this one. On every turn of this film, all I could think about was the Director's gimmicks instead of losing myself in the film. Director Joe Wright should have let the great actors he had tell the story, instead of wasting time with... E[...] a deer!<br /><br />Hannah has its moments, but those moments are few and far between for a movie that has no personality and those moments are so few, that they garner only 2 stars from this reviewer.wists and turns.

0545259088|3.0|This is the third and last installment of the Wolves of Mercy Falls series. (Shiver is book 1 and Linger is book 2.)    PLOT: Warmth is returning to Mercy Falls and with it Grace has returned. Cole is still working on a cure. Time is of the essence as a wolf hunt has been approved.     PROS: It's suspenseful in that soap opera sort of way. You want to know what is going to happen next and you just have to keep reading.    The love is back. The affection between Sam and Grace that was so lacking in book 2, is once again evident in this book.     The supporting characters improved from book 2 also. Isabel and Cole prove to be far more tolerable this time around. And there's more Rachel.    CONS: OK, I'll believe that humans can turn into wolves, but why should I believe Cole can find a cure? Because his father is brilliant? Because of his previous drug addiction? He doesn't even have a laboratory!    Why is Sam suddenly upset with Beck? It's not like he just found out that Beck was responsible for his attack.    And why does Cole never turn into a wolf for the winter?    3.5 STARS: After purchasing book 2, I washed my hands of the series.  I'd read the previous reviews for this one and had decided against buying it. Then it was offered through Vine and I couldn't resist finding out how it all ended. I could have wished for a firmer conclusion, but I believe it was meant to be solidly hopeful. I'd recommend this book if you purchased book 2 (Linger). But if you've only read the first book (Shiver), then stay happy and let it end with that. You're not missing anything.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Maybe it's the fact that we've had way way way way too many superhero movies lately, or maybe it's the fact that all of these superhero movies we have had lately are ALL THE SAME!!  Sure they're different characters, with different ways they are created, born or transformed, but for godsakes, I can only count 2 that stepped away from the formulaic same old same old screenplay: Dark Knight & X:Men First Class.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA is an interesting film, don't get me wrong, and I'm almost certainly gonna buy the BLu-ray when it's available, but it has pretty much the exact same storyline as Spiderman 1-3, Iron Man 1-2, Batman Begins, Green Lantern etc. etc. etc. Superhero starts out a normal guy, becomes a superhero, learns he has skills, practices his skills, bad guy threatens to destroy the world and Superhero fights bad guy.<br /><br />I know. I know. That's comics. Like I said, maybe it's the oversaturation of these movies on the cinemaplexes. You may ask, what do you want? Well, I want the unpredictablility of DARK KNIGHT. I want the emotions of X:Men First Class. I want to feel my guy tensed up in knots like it did when Sebastian Shaw comes to convince the mutant students to join him, or when the Joker put the two people Batman cared about in different warehouses and you actually... wait for it... wait for it... FELT SOMETHING.<br /><br />I wanted to feel something. I wanted to feel some emotions, rather than just saying, that was cool looking. CAPTAIN AMERICA is cool looking, and for what it is, it's a good movie. It's just, in my opinion, another cookie-cutter superhero movie to throw into the pile with the rest of the superhero movies. Unfortunately, the pile of unique superhero movies is much much much much smaller.
B005KWL2IW|4.0|We're in the midst of a cultural pendulum swing back to the days of 80's thrash metal. Megadeth, Slayer, and Metallica have all been back on the scene for a while with comeback albums like Endgame, Christ Illusion, and Death Magnetic, and now after the Big Four concerts have cemented the return Anthrax re-enters the scene with their first new music since 2003 and their first new album with original singer Joey Belladonna since 1990. It's been a crazy few years for the 'Thrax boys with a new singer Dan Nelson entering and then leaving the fold in short order and a brief back and forth between whether 90's vocalist John Bush or Belladonna would be the one to fill the vocalist slot, does Worship Music emerge from all of that turmoil as a worthy return?    Hell. Yes. This is the best Anthrax release since Sound of White Noise.    The album bears some signs of the confusion. The vocals are mixed to bring out the lower end of Belladonna's voice and in certain songs it feels closer to the Bush-era material and also there's a certain lack of the humor that characterized the Belladonna era (although \\"The Constant\\" does continue the tradition of pop cultural references). But regardless of who they were intended to be sung by these are an awesome bunch of songs. \\"In the End\\" is the highlight, an appropriate tribute to fallen metal heroes such as Ronnie James Dio and Dimebag Darrell. \\"Crawl\\" brings out aspects of Belladonna's vocals (and most of my John Bush comparisons) that I've never heard before and I LOVE. I quibble a little bit with the placement of the \\"hymn\\" instrumental interludes and the first song \\"Earth on Hell\\" irritated me mostly because that title just doesn't sound right whether spoken or sung to me, but these are small problems. Anthrax is back and they have truly brought the noise.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Received this fine watch today, packed well, with the watch in working order.  I had needed a good, reliable work/semi-dress watch for some time.  And I hate having to pay someone to replace batteries every 6-8 months.  The watch had to be water resistant and have a date/day option.  So, after reviewing 20+ pages of Sales watches, I found one.  With a brand name like Seiko on it, I'm sure it'll last me till my son inherits it.  PS - I have large wrists and the band fits to the 2nd or 3rd hole. Just right.

B004DMIIVO|5.0|This movie has done the best of showing a family supporting one another in a battle against a single enemy.  I loved the grandma motivating the network.  It came at the price of being a target, which was a poignant story development.  They dealt with family that had become ostracized and it is all set on a neat rural property.  I can recommend this one to family and friends.

B005D0TETA|3.0|The 2002 DVD release of Yes Symphonic Live has seen many hours in my home theater, showcasing Yes in this amazing concert with a symphony orchestra.  I had longed to see this title released on Blu-Ray, so imagine my excitement when I found this new release in my local music store.  Then imagine my disappointment when animations and film footage start to appear at key moments within this video, replacing the concert footage!  These animated backgrounds were optional on the original DVD release, but not so in this Blu-Ray.  The ultimate tragedy for me was during \\"The Gates of Delirium\\", my favorite song of this concert.  As the band and orchestra wind up together and lock into an amazing groove for the song's middle \\"battle\\" section, cartoonish imagery of soldiers, tanks and planes flow across the screen, obscuring the band and orchestra performance!  I turned the disc off right there and stuffed it into the back row of my collection.  Three stars is all I can muster for what should have been a five star release on Blu-Ray.  At least I still have that old DVD release to enjoy this concert.    Update: I do need to clarify - the amount of imagery is not staggering in context of the entire concert, which looks and sounds fantastic!  But there is more than a few seconds of interruptions - for example, \\"Close to the Edge\\" has two animated sections that are each almost a minute long, and \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" battle sequence has two straight minutes of animation.  There may be more, I didn't finish watching it.  So, your patience for seeing this imagery will certainly vary from mine, but I watch a Yes concert to see the performers play, not to witness animations and video feeds obscure the experience.  If such imagery doesn't bother you, then grab and enjoy this title!
B005974CDU|5.0|A year a go when co-founding and longtime drummer Mike Portnoy threw the other four members for a loop with his departure, things could have easily fallen apart. His explanation was that he felt they were getting stale and the band needed a much needed hiatus to recharge their batteries for say, I don't know, five years!? When in reality he wanted his cake and eat it to and be Avenged Sevenfold's new drummer while still helming DT on drums. But to his dismay they quickly and decisively decided to carry on without him. After listening to their 11th release \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\", they are by no means \\"stale\\". This is one of their best albums to date. From the opening track, the rocking On the Backs of Angels (one of my favorite tracks) along with  Bridges in the Sky, Breaking All Illusions (another favorite) and ending with the beautiful Beneath The Surface this disc is Dream Theater returning to fantastic form. Without Portnoy, the band seems refreshed and recharged without him. Gone are the gutteral vocals by Portnoy, which by the way, I disliked a lot. Remaining founding members John Petrucci and John Myung are in great form on guitar and bass respectively kicking ass, along with keyboard whiz Jordan Ruddess and vocalist James LaBrie, who, by the way, gives some of his best vocals to date. Portnoy's replacement, Mike Mangini was a great choice. A great drummer in his own right, the former Berklee College of Music professor does not miss a beat (pun intended).  Although Portnoy's ploy to hold the band hostage for 5 years backfired in the end I think it set the band free lyrically and musically. It's a great disc!

B00406UK7S|5.0|AS a scholar of ancient history and \\"Maître d'armes\\" of a living history society (ancientbattlessociety.com), I really appreciate epic movie, especially when not Hollywood made. The script reveals itself strongly written so naturally the story flows. The characters, the art and the props tend to stay quite true to the based facts of history. Enjoy a very good movie...<br />Andria

B00001R3GF|3.0|I have/had always looked to the Stones for DEFINITIVE Rock and Roll.  And when Mick Taylor quit the band in 12/74 and the Stones didn't immediately scoop up Mick Ronson from the recently-deceased Mott The Hoople...I knew Rock and Roll as we had known it was on its way out.  Then Elvis died, 8/77; and I thought OMG, should I just go country now or should I just wait and see?  I opted to wait...and June 1978 inflicted \\"Some Girls\\" on us.  Again: Be Serious -say what you want about the (sic) \\"punk-influenced\\" \\"When The Whip Comes Down,\\" the country-lite \\"Far Away Eyes,\\" the ubiquitous show of respect to their R&B roots, \\"Just My Imagination,\\" or even Keef's sublime \\"Before They Make Me Run\\" - I mean, COME ON: what can you say about an album that has the VAPID \\"Miss You\\" as an opening track?  Thirty-something years later, \\"Sone Girls\\" just merely shows that the Rolling Stones should have hung it up when Mick Taylor left, they've just gotten worse and worse with every subsequent album/cd, whatever.  \\"Need proof,\\" you say?  OK: \\"Shine A Light\\" and \\"Bigger Bang.\\"  It's just Mick, Keef & Charlie (and a host of VERY poor \\"side men\\") doing a \\"Stones Tribute Act\\" now.<br />3/26/12:  OK, I bought the damn thing.  And on the \\"companion disc,\\" second song, \\"So Young\\": Chuck Leavell even had the unmitigated temerity to inflict the very same piano solo he's been using since (at least) 1992's \\"Weird Nightmare.\\"  The all-too-short \\"Tallahasse Lassie\\" IS wonderful and, of course, Don Was claps his hands...but JOHN FOGERTY? Just clapping his hands?  This is just TOO SURREAL: the American Guitarist who comes the very closest to picking up on the Stones' \\"vibe,\\" energy, knowledge of the blues, whatever - and he's just clapping hands?  And Ron Wood is playing?  What is wrong with this picture?
B005974CNA|5.0|Long time fan, yet critical when necessary. This was to be an interesting (and critical) release for them, and I have to say - they leave no doubt why they are considered the top act in this genre (and beyond). Everything is top notch, performances, song writing, mixing all aspects of their style, sound, etc. The biggest thing I can pinpoint, is that the songs are fresh and take on new life. It sounds like all other DT (a good thing), but with a twist of new found motivation, creativity, and passion. A Successful Turn of Events! TOP NOTCH!
B0017I1FO4|4.0|EPIC!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that some of the songs have been overplayed on the radio and I tended to bypass them.  I have not owned any Shinedown and was blown away with this CD. It opens up with a swift kick in the @#$ and doesn't really let up.  The guitar is awesome and the vocals bring it!  Highly recommended if you like a rockin CD!!!
0307595862|4.0|This is not the first book in the series, I think it's the 6th, not all of which are available in translation at this time.  However this seems to be the first one to achieve mass circulation, riding on the coat-tails of Stieg Larsson's immensely popular series.  I was amazed to find that the author also writes popular children's books.<br /><br />I have not yet read the earlier books in the series and I definitely plan to do so, so I am rating this at least a 4 star. I can see why there are comparisons with Stieg Larsson - something about the dark tone does resonate with those books.  But I'm hesitant to add the 5th star to this review.  There were too many slow, or do I mean low, points where I started to lose interest and there were several points were I simply could not believe that things could happen as described.  Still, I did find the main character interesting and I do plan to read more of the series.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|I enjoyed Up, so did my wife, but my seven year old daughter ran out of the room screaming just about the time the old man's (Carl Frederickson) house was almost set on fire. Pixar makes great movies, I really have enjoyed them all, but a word of warning, if your child has a tender heart and has not been exposed to endless TV/Movie/videogame violence, if you're a parent that is actually selective in your child's movie consumption and doesn't just automatically take them to every movie that comes out and monitors or limits their media intake, then this film might be a little too suspenseful and heartbreaking. Yeah, the old man learns and grows and the messages in the film are fine, but the journey, is rough and fearful for the very young. It is PG, so if you're going to watch it with any child under 10, I recommend screening it before you watch it with your kids.
0553801473|2.0|In the Acknowledgements, George RR Martin says this books was \\"three bitches and a bastard\\" and I am forced to agree with his own assessment. I've been a fan since before book 2 was released. Every time the next book would come out, I would re-read the entire series to get ready for it, so I certainly don't take this review lightly. So here is what I think the \\"Three bitches and a bastard\\" were.<br /><br />Number 1<br /><br />Character development. The best part of this series for me is the characters, their realism and how they change and move with the story. Even the minor characters came alive. Dance is a major step back I feel. I just finished the book and very few if any minor characters even come to mind. But worst of all, some of the main characters are out of character, stagnant or becoming less dimensional. The worst is Dany. She's gone through too much in life to start acting like some dumb starry-eyed teenage girl. Where is that fiery dragon blood? George martin could have really taken Tyrion to a whole new level after what happened at the end of storms, yet Tyrion seems to have turned into just a weaker boring shadow of his past.<br /><br />Number 2<br /><br />The plot. Like many people have said, it hardly moved. I can handle a slow moving plot if the characters move, evolve and are engaging, but that also fell flat.<br /><br />Number 3<br /><br />Cliffhangers. Was anything resolved? Before reading the book, I imagined that the heart of this book would actually be about the resolution of all the cliffhangers that were left at the end of the book. The cliffhangers should have been around the middle of the book and the last half would have been the satisfying conclusion. Instead it feels like we simple got 1000 pages of setup that I thought was already mostly set up.  Too many fake deaths and cheap shock scenes feel like the author is doing everything in his power to keep you interested.<br /><br />And the\\" bastard\\": The passion<br /><br />In George Martin's blog, he talks about Dance of dragons being 'Kong' and him beating or knocking down Kong. When I saw that, I thought to myself, the passion and  the excitement has to be long gone. It honestly feels like that too. You can tell he did everything in his power to make this book 'not suck', but in doing so, he may have forgot to try to make it great like the first three.<br /><br />In my opinion, George Martin is playing scared. Something happened after storm of swords that shook his confidence. It's not so much that he has 'writers block' or he is just milking it for money,  but he is scared to give himself more issues with the type of conclusions a storm of swords gave. And the fact that he is much older, much more famous and has created an entire universe of this world in other products, makes him even more scared. So what he does is stop at the point where it's just about to get good so he has 5 extra years to make sure the next step works.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />The book was still entertaining in parts. I liked some of the earlier Davos and Bran chapters. The Reek chapters felt like the old George Martin! I loved them. It had a full arc since it really wasn't crucial to the constrained plot. Maybe, just maybe if George Martin  decides to finally let loose and find the passion of the first 3 books, the series may be saved. If he continues to play scared and keeps trying to battle 'Kong', he will surely lose.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love this book. it is just as good as the other three books in the series. evenBETTER! would recommend percy jackson series to anyone!!! buy it!!!
B000002LN9|2.0|Of course the album (CD) is great, but the case is destroyed. How can you ship a jewel case in a plastic wrapper with no padding. I buy the physical product so I can present it. Pity.
B0051T46XM|2.0|Blair Witch meets the love child of King Kong and Jimmy Durante.  I really wanted to like this. I didn't mind the shaky cam bit that much, nor the mocumantary style. I just thought it was way too slow, and the jokes got old rather fast. I nodded out for a few minutes in the middle. The effects weren't bad, and the scenery was quite good, but not good enough to carry the movie.  As a side note, the subtitles were some of the worst I've ever seen. Quite a bit of talking would go on and then maybe a 4 or 5 word sentence would eventually appear. I ended up switching to the dubbed version, which is something I almost never do, but I was clearly missing out on a lot of banter.
1572814349|5.0|When I asked to review The Golden Tarot by Kat Black, I had no idea of what was in store for me, I love reviewing decks and sharing what I think with others and generally I always give positive reviews of a deck because I feel that each deck is a true treasure for someone to cherish and develop a strong bond with. The Golden Tarot absolutely blew my mind with it's hard shelled, keepsake box and breathtakingly beautiful gilt edges and fabulous imagery! It instantly became one of my favorites.    The Golden Tarot was first introduced on the web and despite it's start involving piracy and then finally a campaign by online fans which ultimately led to it's publication by US Games Systems, we now have a gorgeous deck that brings a Medieval/Renaissance flavor that adds elegance and surprising depth to this deck. I love the stand up, slip off top box that holds the cards and the 198 page instruction booklet safe and sound between use, it's not only quite attractive but sturdy and durable. The edging on the box is done in a brown and gold-ish design that adds just the right touch to make it stand out.    This deck was created to showcase the highly under rated, phenomenal artwork from the 1200-1500's (in which we see artwork just before the very beginnings of the Renaissance period) which began to show reality rather than a stylized representation of the earlier art seen in the medieval period.  Much of the Golden Tarot's style is from a period called International Gothic that eventually evolved into the Renaissance style. Kat Black chose not to use artwork that was familiar (like works from Botticelli, daVinci and Michelangelo)  in order to bring recognition to the brilliant but lesser known paintings that needed to be shared and discovered by everyone who has the privilege of working with this gorgeous deck.    The 22 Major Arcana as well as the 56 Minor Arcana cards are all digitally collaged and I was quite surprised to discover this because the images are so seamless Iwould have never known had I not read about her teqniques and artistic style. I discussed the cards with a few friends of mine and after looking at the imagery, they were surprised as well since the cards are so perfectly presented.    The Major Arcana are absolutely magnificent, I love the earthy colors and and gilded edging on the cards that simply take my breath away, I remember remarking to folks how beautiful The Golden Tarot is with it's gilt edging and gorgeous light brown marbled borders with card titles across the bottom written in very elegant font. The deck is reminiscent of The Rider Waite and the meanings are easily recognizable with little added images that really lend a depth to readings that I haven't found in other decks, like the Temperance card in which we can see a winged nun standing in a small stream pouring water from one stylish cup to another.     Above Temperance is a small saint bestowing a blessing upon her that I absolutely love. I'm not sure why this small saint impresses me so much but it so totally fits in with this rendering of Temperance and it is one of my favorite cards from The Golden Tarot.    The Minor Arcana are also absolutely gorgeous and are also bordered with the same light brown marbled borders and titles of each card at the bottom. The suits are Wands, Coins, Swords and Cups with Court Cards named Page, Knight, Queen and King. I just adore the way Kat chose to present the Court Cards with the youthful Pages, each standing holding the symbol of their suit, the Queens each show a beautiful bust of each Queen also holding the symbol of their suit, the gallant Knights each riding an elegantly decorated steed and the King of Wands and Swords seated at a gorgeously adorned throne and the Kings of Cups and Coins standing with symbols of their suit surrounding them.    This is absolutely among one of my favorite decks and shuffles fantastically making it a joy to work with. I thoroughly enjoyed sharing my interpretations of cards pulled from The Golden tarot the last two weeks as I worked with it and got ready to write my review, I even noticed fresh ways of looking at interpretations that I may not have thought of simply because the artwork and imagery is so beautiful. I would absolutely recommend this deck for both beginners and experts alike and I truly think this would make an excellent addition to anyone's Tarot collection.

B004FQKY5Q|5.0|After Roxette's split I had little hope that this divorced couple would be able to set aside their differences and work together again.  I'd tried Marie's solo album, the Change, and it left me cold.  I never even tried any of Per Gessel's solo efforts.  I became even less hopefully when it seemed the two had difficulty coming together to record for their 25th Anniversary release--which was simply yet another \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums with 2 new tracks and those two bonus tracks were somewhat lack-luster compared to what they had done in the past.  Charm School was a pleasant surprise and exceeded my expectations; it is familiar enough to strike a nostalgic chord and fresh enough not to be boring.  I am less enamored by the live disk as I'd heard all those songs so many times in the past and I feel there wasn't anything new they could add to them, but it is fine for what it is and when I want to hear those \\"classic\\" Roxette tunes I will no doubt give it a spin.  So 3 cheers for Charm School and here's hoping that it's just the beginning of more new material from this very talented duo.
B005E7AOHI|3.0|First, I really love Primus. I remember seeing them live in the early 1990s and they were so awesome.<br /><br />That being said, I am disappointed with this record, even though it appears to be growing on me.<br /><br />If I had to define the sound, I'd have to say psychotic circus music. The songs are very similar, with a strong bass line behind Lane's drumming, with Claypool speaking in the background. Lalonde's guitar playing is what you'd expect from Primus--typical but nothing very original.<br /><br />Jay Lane's a talented drummer; his high-hat work is especially impressive--it's among the fastest I've heard.<br /><br />Claypool's playing style has definitely changed. Much less slapping and popping (in fact I don't think I've heard any popping). Most of his bass is played normally.<br /><br />In the end, I appreciate the musicianship but am disappointed by the music.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I won't go over old ground and express my disappointment that the original 'unmucked about with' trilogy isn't included here as I'm sure many others have done that more than adequately already. What I am just as disappointed about is the exclusion of extra features that were on previous DVD editions. How hard would it have been to include them on this set? Not hard at all, I'd imagine. Instead we get things like a very short interview snippets and featurettes celebrating Star Wars fans and tv/movie/internet spoofs. Sure, there's a lot of good stuff here but it could have included all the previously released material too. As it stands, hardcore fans will have to hold on to their bonus discs from old DVD releases.    As for the video and audio quality of the movies themselves...outstanding. It's the best they've ever looked on home video. If I had to give a rating for quality alone I would give it 5 stars. As it is, I have to mark it down for not giving the option of viewing the original trilogy without all the 'special edition' changes and for not including previously available special features.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Amazing cast with great chemistry. This show has a lot of great dramatic and comedic moments.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|The only issue I have is with Little Lion Man and the explicit lyrics. I know there is a version out there that's radio safe but I can't find it on Amazon. I just had to delete the song. Other than, this album is pure musical genius.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Very funny with dramatic heart felt moments that can bring tears to your eyes. It's very well written and you can't help but love the characters and cast. Castle just keeps getting better.
1400052181|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read.  It is seriously the only book i have ever really enjoyed.  This book comes in new condition and has a great cover and introduction to  the book.  I would refer this book to any body interested in a great read or if you love science and want to learn about cells..    I would technically refer this to anybody (Even if you hate reading), because it is such a meaningful story that everybody should get to know here...

B000AYEL1A|5.0|A re-make of an earlier classic movie .The music & casting can't be beat.    Barbara & Chris are perfect in this movie
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I get it if you grew up with the originals. I however fell in love with Star Wars at the impressionable age of 6 with the Special Editions. I bought the 2004 DVDs. I dig the prequels. I have no memory of an unmolested OT, so this must be why I'm not bothered with the constant change. I apologize if I put amonkey wrench in the whole boycott thing, but I'm buying this and won't be bothered by NOOOOOOOgate.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I heard Star Wars is coming out in 3-D soon and they will be\\"in order\\" from I-VI, so i thought I would get this before that happens (because we all know just how great 3-D is). However I must say this is disappointing. So now that Lucas has \\"Fixed\\" his brainchild, I shall now list what really needs to be fixed.<br /><br />1. Darth Vader's \\"NO\\" must be removed<br />2. CGI clutter must be removed from all frames<br />3. Hayden Christiansen must be removed from Ep. VI<br />4. Boba Fett's voice must be restored to the original Jason W. voice<br />5. Han must shoot first in the cantina<br />6. Ben Kenobi's Krayt Dragon re-dub (or whatever you want to call it) must be removed and restored to the original<br />7. The Prequels must be removed<br /><br />I highly suggest that Lucas watch RedLetterMedia's review of his previous three movies so he can see where he went wrong and fix it. Until the originals are back as the actual originals and are for sale separate from the Prequel Tragedy, I will not by this.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|This movie is an excellent example of how racism in America forced a black man to foresake his heritage.    It is such a shame that this country still focuses on race and color rather than the individual.    It also shows no matter how miserable you are there is always someone just as miserable if not more so.    All of those narrow or short minded people who criticize this movie need to check themselves.    There are hundreds of thousands of African Americans here in the U.S. who are passing for white.      There is an autobiography \\"Life on the Color Line\\" by Gregory Howard Williams.  The author did not find out that he was black until he was almost in middle school.    So I wouldn't be so cocksure about yourself until you check your DNA.
B003VYAVGA|5.0|Great CD.  There isn't one song on the CD that I don't like.  Plays over & over in my car.
0061537969|1.0|I never write reviews, but I am so irritated by this book I must speak to whomever wants to listen.    I love the idea from the dogs point of view! I love dogs! I don't mind the racing theme! I love Seattle! But, the agonizing melodrama is too, too much! I mean seriously, the wife is basically dying from the get go of brain cancer and then lets just throw a book long rape charge into the mix! It's frustrating and the dog's witt and appeal are totally lost in the midst of this really pointless (and unrealistic) turn of events.     I just don't get it. I really don't. This book was a total and complete waste of $14.99! If I could rate it negative stars I would do so and I have not said this about a book in a VERY VERY long time! But, I know you wil buy it anyway because I am a reviewer in the minority and I probably wouldn't listen to me either.
B003TJ4YU6|3.0|I'm one of the biggest fan of Beatles of all the time...BUT!!!

B004RJMUJO|2.0|This game worked great on my Nexus One. However, now that I've gotten an HTC Sensation, the screen is intermittently unresponsive. Bummer!
B0012Q732O|4.0|I thought this movie was awesome. Strangely though I have met very few people who agree with me. After a few unnecessarily long debates I find it boils down to this. Which are you more likely to say?    \\"A mammoth building a pyramid? That's could never happen and is an insult to my intelligence.\\" - someone who will not like this movie    \\"A mammoth building a pyramid? That's could never happen and sounds amazing. I wanna see that!!\\" - someone who will like this movie    Aside from that i don't think anyone can deny its visually appealing.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|More elaborate than the first Nikki Heat book, this is a twisty mystery pursued by the characters we've come to love on Castle. Less focused on the relationship between Nikki and Rook, this one seemed more focused and less like a screen-to-page translation of a standard episode. No great literature here, but a fun and engaging ride.
B0054N73EY|5.0|This is the first RHCP album I have ever purchased.. I'm 20 years old and am now finally realizing what an amazing band I have been missing out on. In my opinion, the best songs are: \\"Monarchy of Roses,\\" \\"Factory of Faith,\\" \\"Look Around,\\" and \\"Rain Dance Maggie.\\" I can't wait to dig deeper and see what great music I have been missing..
B004MC8CA2|1.0|An interesting and mostly sympathetic story, that I greatly enjoyed.  However, it is full of logical fallacies and contradictions.  Hopefully future updates will correct these issues.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This is the best comedy I have seen in quite a while, it's definitely a Laugh Out Loud movie which usually isn't the case.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I purchased this product [[ASIN:B000X107GI Maxell CR2032 lithium ion batteries (pack of 5 )]] from Amazon.com.<br />Batteries are working very well.  I also received them very quickly.  For the price we paid, we are very happy<br />with them.
B005974CNA|5.0|I am an avid Dream Theater fan. I have all their records and most of the ytse Jam bootlegs. This record I have to say is fantastic. An embodiment of the melodic nature from Images and Words, progressive intensity of Scenes from a Memory, the Heaviness of Train of Thought, and the eeriness of Systematic Chaos. Most comprehensive album since Six Degrees. Unlike the previous 3 albums (especially systematic chaos) which tried to go for a certain niche sound, such as heavier metallic, this album tries to combine the best DT elements over the course of their catalog.     Like most Dream Theater records, this took me quite a few spins (~5) to fully appreciate. I thought the songs flowed very well over the course of the album, and there is a great balance between heaviness and ballad cool downs. Personally though, I cannot get into \\"Beneath the Surface.\\" I felt that song could have either been left off the record or placed in another part of the album. To me it seems ending on \\"breaking all illusions\\" would have been perfect and would send a clear message to DT fans about the continuation of the Dream Theater empire.     Mangini did a great job with the material that was given to him. I really wish he got a chance to contribute to the writing but I guess that will have to wait til next time. His playing is not in you're face like Portnoys (mostly due to the fact that the drum mix is waaaay lower). Mangini also establishes a very nice groove, somewhat behind the beat but at the same time totally locked in. It's very cool and definitely different.      The production on the album is great, I personally enjoy Andy Wallace's mix more than Paul Northfield's since it's not as edgy and more rounded/lush. The drums have been mixed lower than usual creating a very guitar centric sound. The lower drum mix gives room to finally hear Myung's lines supporting Petrucci's guitar riffs along with amazing bass solos. We can also hear Rudess's restraint from using a barrage of synth and regressing to beautiful piano and string orchestrations. The lower drum mix along with Mangini's style also creates a more melodic as opposed to in your face sound. Overall, great and refreshing album. Highly recommend it over any of the last three albums.
159102594X|5.0|The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie is a set of three novels adhered together to create a single, epic tale. Just like every other fantasy trilogy, I hear you shout from the sidelines. No, it is not just like every other fantasy trilogy. The novels act as progression points in developing a violent, sophisticated and politicalised world - yes, politics!<br /><br />The Blade Itself is the first novel, followed by Before They Are Hanged and Last Argument of Kings. Don't be deceived: you cannot judge these books by their covers. I quickly discovered the titles have nothing to do with the story. Though if you look carefully, you'll be able to discover the roots of these quotes and garner an appreciation of just how well-constructed these novels are. Each novel is broken into three parts, each with a quote attached as an introduction. I found that I was looking forward to the next section of the novel for both a new quote and the next stage of the tale.<br /><br />In my own opinion, the First Law Trilogy is the most well-rounded and satisfying series of novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Each character is interesting and believable, likeable and dislikable. The political world is intertwined with murder, violence and torture: themes that have come to define Joe Abercrombie as a serious, fantasy author. The story is not particularly exciting and jam-packed with action, but it pans out as an interesting tale that draws you in with each page turn.<br /><br />I cannot relate Joe Abercrombie to any other author I have read, or rather any other author that pulls off unjustifiable violence so well. The First Law Trilogy is a series that surprised me more often than not. I finished Last Argument of Kings with a deep sigh of satisfaction. Not surprisingly, Joe Abercrombie went on to write two more novels, Best Served Cold and The Heroes, both of which surpassed all my expectations. Abercrombie has also been commissioned to write another stand-alone novel and trilogy, set in the same world.<br /><br />The story follows three main characters and three semi-main characters. Abercrombie does well in always keeping your attention and not dawdling on one character for too long. You come to care about each character's ambitions and fears, a rare experience in a literary world competing for their reader's attention. Fantasy sells from a fan-base and Abercrombie does well in generating one.<br /><br />If you're in for a good tale of intrigue, betrayal and violence, Abercrombie is a sure bet. Happy reading!<br /><br />((For more fantasy news and reviews, visit my blog attached to my profile.))ld.    The story follows three main characters and three semi-main characters.

0316098329|2.0|I listened to the audio book, which was absolutely obnoxious. I was very disapointed and completely lost interest right away. I have four children of my own and they do not speak in this way. It became quite annoying listening to the way this five year old spoke. Characters were very dull. I felt the mother's personality should have been much different, considering she is held prisoner. Why tv? Why cable? Didn't grasp this story. It really could have been a great story, but the author fell short.

B004SIP8JI|5.0|Love the romance in this movie.  Not crazy about some of the language.  It is all so improbable, a fantasy, but it works for me.
B004SC8YH2|5.0|The latest from CC is amazing and thought-provoking. Although you can tell he has lost some prcey arrangements in recent years and you can't help but appreciate how he has suffered for his integritized art, he still manages to shine here.  He is contemplative without navel-gazing and hopeful without resorting to cliches or axioms that either date him or cause sighs of overuse or of being too-youthful.  The last cut is more a benediction then a song but he has always sailed with peace in his heart. The albums unity and cohesion is one his best and reminds me of the negelected \\"Another Page\\" with songs that hit his marrow bone in honest self-revelation.  Not for the Justin Bieber crowd but worth a look for anyone who has missed him or seen him in an intimate small-stage concert ever. It should also hold-up in time as an appeal to sanity politically when presently there is none.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|I have a Sony PS3 that I use as my Blu-Ray player, but for some reason this is the only disk I've found that the PS3 won't play.  I thought it was defective, so I returned the first one and received a replacement, only to find that the new disk fails to play too.  I thought maybe my PS3 software was out of date, but it's not - I confirmed that it is current.  It plays all the other Blu-Ray disks I own (and I have quite a number of them).  I don't know what is different about this disk, but it won't play.  I guess I'll have to buy a newer player...
B002HUQ1VS|5.0|Expecting a nostalgic, mediocre effort, I was shocked to find that this is their best album to date - it's absolutely amazing from start to finish.     I've been listeing to Anthrax for 15 years. I always preferred their Belladonna era lineup, and their mid-late 80s albums (Among the Living, Spreading the Disease, State of Euphoria).    Worship Music tops those- the band has returned to their fast, punk infused thrash roots, but has absolutely never sounded tighter. Ian, Bello, and Benante have meshed into a tight, metal assault unit and their playing has never been better. Belladonna's vocals haven't faded at all since \\"State\\".     This album picks up where \\"State\\" and \\"Among\\" left off, and they've never sounded better. Five headbangin' stars.
B001F6TXME|3.0|I do like how this remote work, but the length is TOO SHORT! Whats the point in having a remote when you can't move more than 20 inches away from the camera. They need to make a wireless or allow more length.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|the more people boycott purchasing this sad and disappointing release the sooner the message to lucas and his butt kissers that enough is enough. the tampering is beyond a joke and the closer we will be to having the release we all hoped it would be.    I grew up with star wars from the age of 10 and I'm appalled at the shocking problems which are still outstanding from previous transfers..     hopefully when it rapidly gets discounted to 40 bucks it will still remain a poor seller.    hear your fans lucas.. they are not happy.
B0000500WO|5.0|the debut album by massive attack is great to listen to after all these years. if you want a cool, soothing vibe that isn't just ambient music, this is a great choice (it brings the bass!) i was introduced to massive attack in 1998 with protection, and immediately wanted to hear more. blue lines did not (and does not) disappoint.
1594744769|2.0|There are reasons why pictures aren't usually found in successful novels. One: readers don't typically want to be shown a picture of what characters in a novel look like. Why? As we read we develop an image of what main characters look like and we don't like our image to be contradicted with pictures of another's images (even it if said images came from the author's mind). This same concept can be applied to why a person typically favors either the book or the movie. They like the images from one better than the other and don't like the contradiction. Second: readers want to sink into a novel (especially a fantastical novel). Inserting a glob of pictures creates a jaunty book journey. Every time a reader encounters a grouping of pictures they are jaunted from the depths of the novel to the surface and it takes time (unnecessary time) to return to the depths. Riggs has not ingeniously stumbled upon some untrodden path with this idea, but, instead, clumsily thought to employ an idea that has already been tried and suffered failure. Additionally, while he has an interesting concept it's not thoroughly fleshed out. There is too much detail and time spent on the beginning of the novel which creates a boring and stagnant atmosphere. As a consequence of this, the middle to end (especially end) suffer from a speed that is too fast (a place where he could have capitalized on his concepts). I'm giving two stars because the concept was certainly unique, but it's not unique enough to balance out the major flaws of a clearly novice writer.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I was very excited for this and wow am I disappointed. I brought it home only to realize it doesnt work! It usually won't even recognize my hands and when it does it only tracks them a 1/3 of the time. DO NOT BUY.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|Just wasn't enough content for me.  Had some potential but fell flat.  Just not enough meat in the story.  These style of books are a dime a dozen so I am picky with which ones I continue on with.  I will not be buying the sequels.
B003498SDA|5.0|Must see movie. The cast and acting were excellent. Plot was amazing. Tom Cruise put on an excellent display of firearms proficiency!
B0053YEM7U|4.0|I didn't expect to like this record.  Yes haven't released a record without Jon Anderson for quite a while.      But, I like it.  I liked it the first time I heard it.  Benoit David's voice is different.  Not better, but certainly not a lot worse.  The music is good.  All in all I am pleasantly surprised.    If you are a Yes fan, ignore the nay sayers and try this out!  I was glad I did.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I Love this band and had very high expectations(like jake ownen's fail) but this lived up -----PLUS !!!  love every song, no deadbeats,,,,just lady a classic....hits....a+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
0553266306|3.0|I give it 3 STARS.<br /><br />The cops are just too clever, and I dont know any clever cops. I worked around all kinds of cops for 25 years, and police work doesnt attract the best and brightest people. Cops find donuts faster than they find clues, and every cop on the planet flees from trouble faster than they flee from snakes in their path. How many cops searched for bin Laden for how many years?<br /><br />But someone knew where to find Chacal to make the referral to OAS.<br /><br />Chacal didnt impress me much. I was stunned when he painted his car and immediately drove it across France before the paint dried. Huh? I was impressed with his cross-dressing disguise, it was clever and interesting.<br /><br />Sociopaths and cops arent emotional people, so the tone of the book was accurate.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|Not a bad game. Some good gun placements,requiring strategy to kill all monsters before they escape. Have been unable to beat grave witch.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|My experience was the polar opposite.  Granted, I've only tried it with the Kinect Tuner and Dance Central so far, but I took the two minutes to install it and my Kinect experience immediately improved.    My setup: I have a 40\\" Sony LCD HDTV standing perhaps 2-3 feet off the floor, atop a piece of furniture.  The Kinect Sensor sits on the TV's base, so it's just under the screen.  I only have about 6 feet of space between my TV and couch (with a wall directly behind the couch), with hardwood floor underneath.  The room was well-lit at the time I used it.    Prior to installing the Zoom, my Kinect Sensor could ALMOST get my whole body in the frame when I was standing all the way back against the couch.  Now, I can stand 1-2 feet in front of the couch, and it sees my whole body, with lots of room to spare!  During my time with the Tuner, it didn't see me at one point; I walked away, then came back, and all was fine from that point on.  Hand tracking functioned 100%, but the positioning feels different now because you don't have to be so far away!  I don't have any games that check for the floor, so I can't speak for that.    I can now actually play Dance Central, so this is a 5-star item for me and worth every penny.  It may be that the Zoom will or won't work for you based on your setup.  I second the notion of the reviewer asking for folks to post their setups along with their reviews.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|Like alot of people here, I was excited about this product and was anxious for it to come out.   Found out that Best Buy had them in stock this week and immdiately purchased one.   Upon hooking up at home, I had no issues at first. But more I used it the less it could see me. Keep in mind, my Kinect is already mounted below my tv!    I thought it was just the game I was using it with, which was the UFC ultimate workout game. So I figured Id try it with another game like Kinect Sports, but still had the same issues. Actually it had gotten worse. It could barely see me, would show me moving erratically when I wasnt moving and could not see the floor anymore. Even though I tried calibrating it with and without the Zoom on it, it just would not work right for me. Now after seeing the numerous users having the   same issue, just figured Id return it and chalk it up to it being a hardware issue.     Im really hoping they can fix the issue with this or another company can come up with one of these that doesnt have as many flaws as this had because this would get alot more people using thier Kinects.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I never played any of the RE games, and never watched previous episodes. I bought this was mainly due to the strong 3D reviews.  And boy was I glad!  The second opening scene of the battle sequence was just out of this world! Well, its more \\"out of screen\\" - from the triple blades coming at me and then follow by all the bullets and shells out of the guns.  Wow! The movie ended up having lots of scenes with good depth (in-screen), and great out-of-screen 3D effects.    The story was good, being a Sci-Fi fan. It did get me to go back and watch all the previous episodes, and I might just pick up a RE game!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I cant believe that i got my copy already! totally awesome!!! Im watching episode IV and it looks totally awesome on my LED tv. Wow! Say what you want about all the changes it is useless to resist...
B004L49K2A|4.0|As someone who has been a fan of Duran Duran from the get go int he early 80s i have followed their music on and off through the years with great interest.    This latest release has some relaly good tracks on it.  My favorite is \\"The Man who stole a Leopard\\" followed by \\"Blame the Machines\\".  The music is great, the lyrics seem spot on and the production quality is great.    If your a classic Duran Duran fan you will like this CD.
B0050VI5SI|5.0|I love Foster the People.  This band is incredible. Their fusion of electronic with a sometimes Brit pop sound with the occasional alternative rock guitar throw in here and there make it must listen.  Mark Foster is an incredible song writer, and his melodies are so catchy that you'll find yourself singing them all day in the car, the elevator ride to your office, at your desk, and in the shower.  I can't stop listening to this album, and I was so wanting to hear more music from them since I bought the 4 track EP way earlier this year.  And I have to say my favorite songs on the album aren't even the ones released on the EP (even though those are really good regardless).  My favorites tracks are Call It What You Want (just a fun upbeat in your face lyric type of song), Waste, I Would Do Anything For You (a beautiful fun love song that'll make you shake your booty), and Life On The Nickel (a mega electronic infused drum beat with tribal sounding toms throughout the jam; such a great freakin' track).  If you like electronic and house music and also the occasional Brit pop sound (especially on the last song Warrant where Mark Foster using a lo-fi effect on his voice).  The song Don't Stop has such a Blur sound to me.  Foster the Peopl are a force to be reckoned with.  Just sayin'.  I'm going to see them again tonight.  Twice in less than three months is awesome!!!  Terrific album.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  Ranks right up there with Syntax's Meccano Mind album frojm 2004.  Just great great music.    Pascal
B0058VA2U4|3.0|I just think the John Bush Anthrax is so far superior! This cd is ok but it doesnt grab you the way WCFYA did. J B's voice is just so much more hard rock and heavy metal. belladonna seems like a nice guy but his voice is kinda whiny and weak. all the cds that anthrax made with bush, wcfya,vol 8,442 and white noise are all better than this. charlies drumming as always is awesome but the riffs and music dont compare to the bush era. I think anthrax didnt like the so so sales of wcfya and panicked and scrapped that great lineup of anthrax. I dont know what happened with the nelson guy but I would have like to have heard it. its not all about money boys, finish your tour with belladonna and bush back! WCFYA is one of the 20 geatest heavy metal cds ever made.. dont blow it!
B004T5R2HQ|4.0|This is a very good app. It has saved me so many times &amp; works great! I wouldn't change a thing.
B005974CDU|5.0|Wow!! Is all I can say for this new album by prog-metal giants, Dream Theater. Welcome aboard Mike Mangini who has played w/ Annihilator, Steve Vai, Extreme, and James Labrie to my knowledge. His drum skills are that of technical and skilled to the highest order. The \\"new\\" batch of songs on this CD, takes my ears back to the Images and Words/Awake Days (1992-1994). This is the best thing to come out since Awake,(NOT saying that recent Dream Theater cds are crap, I love em all) eventhough it keeps its modern feel, the songs are a little more basic/clean if you will, they don't have any special vocal fx and keeps things pleasant. I'm still listening for other neat stuff to come out of this CD! It was worth the extra bucks for the 1 Day-Shipping! :)     Buy this CD and you WILL NOT be disappointed! 5 Stars for this GREAT NEW RELEASE!!
B004I4H8QS|5.0|No complaints. The CD was delivered in a timely fashion and in excellent condition. This has always been one of my favorite albums. The second CD in this deluxe edition does not disappoint. It could stand on it's own as a separate album.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|The great beginning of Batman! Nolan is awesome! The greatest of all heroes!  O maior herói que existe!!!!Batman é o CARA!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005974CNA|4.0|It is different from their Mike Portnoy day's material. Not as heavy as I thought it should but enjoyable to say the least.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Not gonna buy this.      George, they are your movies and you can do whatever you want with them but please include the original versions.  If you included them I'd buy no matter what you changed or put in.  Heck, you could go nuts - put Ewoks and Jar Jar in every scene.  Have a back seat in the X-Wing so Jar Jar can be with Luke when he blows up the Death Star.  Ewoks on Hoth.  Go to town.  I'd still buy it with the originals included.      Guess I'll pick up a bootleg version.
0316069485|4.0|Well, here, we have an interesting twist on the courtroom drama generic.  A convicted child killer is re-trialed for a vicious crime he was found guilty of 25 years ago by the State of Los Angeles, and Micky Heller - world famous defense attorney - has agreed to work for the prosecution.  Characterisation is good as always for the mainstay characters - Bosch, Heller and Co as well as the `bad' lawyer in this case - Royce - who is acting for the defense.  At times the book is gripping and the pace works quickly leading to the emotional crescendo at the end.  The first ending - when it comes - is shocking (and therefore great) but there is a second ending I found a little disappointing.  I can't say anything more without spoiling the purchase but I cant give the book 5 stars for this reason alone.
0143038419|5.0|Thanks! Cant wait to read it! Great price plus quick delivery and excellent condition for a used item all add up to a worthwhile purchase. Would recommend to others.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I loved my Swivel Sweeper when I first got it. After less than a year I noticed it dying sooner on the battery & limited power. Within a few more uses, the battery stopped working. Since it costs about a 1/3 the price of a new sweeper for a replacement battery, I just left it in the closet. Waste of money unless the battery works!
B002JTHFUS|5.0|Bought this for my husband for our anniversary and he was so excited. He spends many an evening in the living room listening to it and poring over all the bonus materials. I almost downloaded the album on iTunes instead and am glad I didn't. When there is this much thought and artistry put into CD packaging, it is so worth it to buy the actual CD.
B000001FG5|4.0|SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN is the Bee Gees last albom of their 70s disco juggernaut.  Riding their phenomenally successful SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER as far as it would take them, SPIRITS brought them 2 #1 hits in TRAGEDY and TOO MUCH HEAVEN and a moderate hit in LOVE YOU INSIDE AND OUT.  Overall, this is a solid effort, focusing on the boys' trademark harmonies, vibrato vocals and infectious rhythms.  Notable exceptions to the expected are STOP THINK AGAIN, a lengthy pseudo-blues number with jazzy instrumentation and the brief ballad UNTIL, with a beautiful melody and one of the best uses of Barry's quavering falsetto.  The title tune is a clever Caribbean flavored song, a nice change of pace.  SEARCH FIND and LIVING TOGETHER make good use of the danceable staccato rhythms.  Of course, TRAGEDY has that great \\"explosion\\" between choruses that you end up anticipating eagerly.  Oddly enough, my least favorite track is TOO MUCH HEAVEN which is redundant and limited in its melodic construction.<br />SPIRITS really didn't stretch the Bee Gees abilities but focused on maintaining their disco fanbase and to that extent they succeeded.  While not their best album, SPIRITS is well done and representative of a key period of 70s music scene.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|For starters let me be clear! I am a hard core 'Potter' aficionado who knows everything about the saga like I know my own palm....BUT...I'm not the fan that says: \\"Oh they changed that!\\" and \\"They did that wrong!\\" for one and only reason: Books and films are different; they target a somewhat different audience and have different views. And more importantly sth that is good on page doesn't mean that it will look good on screen. Take comic-book heroes' funky costumes for example.  So entering the next-to-last 'Potter' film I will say that it is phenomenal! It has heart, character development, scenes to get teary or even cry about, special effects and -being the first part of the finale- sets up the pace for the last 'Potter' outing, perfectly.  I am one person that will say what the producers and writer did RIGHT with the changes they made and support WHY they made them. [spoiler ALERT]  A) They added the actual scene that Hermione took the memories of her from her parents.  In a teary prologue-for-the-finale scene that shows what the trio is up to, preparing for their journey of finding and destroying Voldemort's horcruxes (which are bits of Voldemort's soul and the key of his immortality), Hermione takes away all memories of her, from her parents to protect them. The score in this scene is excellent and a teary Hermione looks around the living room as she fades away from all the family photos. So emotional. And her leaving alone her house while crying before the logo is revealed. Wow! It is the end.  B) Death of Hedwig  It was a somewhat small dissapointment I had from Jo's excellent book that Hedwig that made such an impression as an owl and with the famous \\"Hedwig's theme\\" to have such a 'collateral damage' death. So I liked they made her die like a hero ttrying to save Harry from a deatheater and thus making it the reason why Voldemort realises who is the real Harry. Great, great scene!  C) Harry and Ginny's seperation   While I admire Harry's bravery and heroismas he will be forever my childhood hero I found lame and predictable that he broke up with Ginny at the end of 'Half-Blood Prince' book to protect her. I like more that they got seperated because of the circumstances now that the trio is hunted...  D) Dobby   Since they had not included Dobby in the previous films I found very logical his reappearence in Diagon Alley as he is now free to go wherever he wants.  E) Harry and Hermione dancing  In a newly added scene Harry and Hermione are dancing to 'O' Children' by Nick Cave. There was a lot of debait with this scene as some of the fans found that it had a romantic subtext. NO! It's one of the most beautifully written scenes ever. Harry and Hermione shared a friendship different that his and Ron's and now alone, he wanted to cheer her up. They are children that are going through things that children who are 17 years old shouldn't so the song is spot on. The scene is excellent.    The acting is stop-notch and especially in this film that the grown-up cast is not so much around the young cast is shining truly! Emma Watson is incredible and steals almost everyone's thunder! Oh and there is a certain animation scene that really is like it's gotten out of a dream! This is a magical film, I totally recomend it and I can't wait to enjoy 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2' in my TV screen!    P.S. I'm not the one to talk about BD quality but this BD looks flawless!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I downloaded this app for an Archos A70 so that I could listen to music I have stored on Amazon's cloud player.<br /><br />Works fantastically.  Nothing to complain about.<br /><br />It's easy to find songs, albums, or artists and plays flawlessly over the cloud.<br /><br />Awesome!!
014241722X|4.0|If you are coming to this book expecting the usual John Grisham legal thriller you might be disappointed. This book is a toned down version of what he writes for adults and the thing that was removed the most was the thrill part. As the son of two lawyers Theo Boone loves the law with an excessive amount of passion. So much so that he becomes the lawyer of choice among his peers, solving the minor troubles that come into their lives.    The book plods along with a particular tricky legal problem as the main story. Working with the cast of colorful characters in his life and his own genius, Theo eventually solves the problem to a satisfactory conclusion. In the end I think he sells his young audience short on action. If you look at the most successful recent young adult writers (JK Rowling, Suzanne Collins, Rick Riordon), they all manage to blend the danger with narrative targeted at the appropriate age group. So much so they have won audiences with adults as well.  For excitement this book rates about a zero, but I am willing to give Grisham the benefit of the doubt here. It seems this book purpose was to lay out who Theo is, his friends are, and the unique, quirky adults that are in his life. All in all it is a great foundation to a series of books, doing an excellent job at introducing this world. So the ball is in Grisham's court to put the thrill into for book 2 (and I am assuming there will be a book 2) or he will lose too many readers.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Ok, first of all, this is not a children's video - it has a more subtle and dry humor suited for adults. Secondly,if you view this movie a single time you will miss many of the nuances and just flat out funny \\"tricks\\".  The movie does seem to start out slowly and admittedly a bit weird, but if you stay with it you wont be disappointed.  A delightful cast of \\"characters\\" with equally charming voices, it is a movie I heartily  enjoy.
0812973992|5.0|As last weekend was the observation of a decade since the towers of The World Trade Center came down that tragic day, I recalled reading this novel a few months ago and how much I admired the authors tale telling and character invention. The French tightrope walker and his feat of crossing between the North and South WTC towers is at the core of the novel, that starts in Dublin and ends up playing out in Manhattan in the early 70's. A great read, I look forward to the authors next creation.
0545259088|5.0|I remember going to Maggie's signing in Glendale and I think someone asked her Why she wrote this series and her answer was \\"I wanted to write a story that would make people cry. \\" (not sure if it went like that exactly, but vaguely similar to my memory) I am pretty sure Maggie has succeeded and made a lot of people cry with this series.    This series is beautiful and it ended with me feeling hopeful about the wolves and Mercy Falls.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|We discovered COMMUNITY in its second season, so had missed most of the first season. The DVDs arrived quickly in the condition promised, for the correct price. We've already been through all 25 episodes and enjoyed them so much we've started over. The characters on this show seem like real, flawed, mostly good-hearted people, not glamorous or distant. Plus it's the most ethnically diverse cast in the history of television. The show is touching/zany/hilarious, sometimes all at the same time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|...what really needs to be said??<br /><br />I got this app and put it onto an Archos A70 internet tablet to use the tablet for some reading.  Sure, it's not a real Kindle and the screen glare makes it hard to read in the day time, but that's got nothing to do with the app.<br /><br />The app works great.  Finding books, purchasing them, and reading them are all very easy to accomplish.<br /><br />Good stuff.
B004YAS9M8|5.0|Only certain music normaly strikes a cord with me.  This entire album is absolutely wonderful. You will play it repeatedly and it will find an emotional link with you also.  Enjoy
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Dear George,  Star Wars Blu-ray is now averaging 2 out of 5 stars on Amazon.com... you really are a fool. you have noooooooooooooooooooo clue as to what we want as fans - if your beard was in front of me now I would feed it to the nearest Rancor!!!
B004HNTER6|1.0|The description says the language is in English.  However, it is not.  The bonus material has English subtitles, but I bought this to watch the feature.    I've contacted the seller for a refund.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|I redbox this movie for my teen sister and I to watch...I thought the film overall was very entertaining and the characters were very good. Sister and I did not read the books so we did not really have anything to compare it to, but we thought it was just ok. The movie pick up, I would not say it is the best movie ever but it was just ok.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I canceled my per-order because it made me sick of all the new additions and I know a lot of my friends have too. I honestly don't mind the new additions, let Lucas do what he wants as long as you give us a choice. Whats the harm in that? It just made me laugh all the complaints and people canceling their order its still the #1 best seller on amazon for weeks. It honestly seems like people are complaining but are still gonna buy lol. I personally wouldn't buy for ten dollars because the only way Lucas might come around is for nobody to buy it.(which i know wont happen but he wont get my money on principal)
0439023521|4.0|Overall I really liked this book. The middle was especially suspenseful and it became a real page turner. By the end of the book I was satisfied with how it ended but it didn't make me run out and buy the next book in the series. I was expecting the ending to be such a cliffhanger that I had to know what happened next right now! But that wasn't the case.
1594744769|3.0|The book was easy to follow, well written and I did enjoy it. However, I felt it would be more of a horror/suspensful novel. It started out strong and sort of faded away. I would recommend it but it was not as good as I hoped.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|oh yes! oh yes! oh yes!  this is as good as it gets for a film from the 70's!  you've gotta see it to believe it! stupendous!!!  just buy it, turn the lights down and ENJOY!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|The puzzles are hard enough to be challenging without being so hard you get frustrated and quit, I enjoyed it.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|So I normally don't read thrillers, right.  I took about a week to research various authors and decided to buy Lee Child's first Jack Reacher book, right.  After I started reading it, I realized something was bothering me, right.  How about because every person in the book ends their sentences with the word \\"right\\".  At first, I thought Child was trying to use it as a southern Georgia type of accent, but no matter who was in the book, they said it.  The professor in NY, the FBI guy, Jack himself, right.  Granted, the book is dated, but I could have lived with that.  The story was decent and did something with counterfeiting I never heard off.  Pretty good.  But the use of the word \\"right\\" was so overwhelmingly annoying, I couldn't take it.  Also, the in depth description of certain things, like how Child described ever turn on every street that someone took...I turned left here, then right here, then drove 2.35 miles, then made another left.  I think he was just trying to show how detailed Reacher's mind was, but it also got annoying.    The only more annoying thing than this book is the fact that Tom Cruise was just caste to play Reacher in an upcoming movie.  Reacher is about 6'4\\", blond military type.  Cruise is 5'6\\", dark hair, and although he can pull off a kick butt movie, he just isn't Reacher.  Get the guy who plays Eric Northman from True Blood.  He is exactly who I pictured.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The publisher has made it impossible for my to be willing to buy this book. I simply can not pay more for the E-version than the paperback. It should almost be illegal to do so. Kill a tree, waste a box, burn the gas to get it here all for less than a digital transfer. The environment screams.
B002VL3R1K|5.0|My five points are based on the book's historical significance. (Review based on first English edition--1939).<br /><br />Perusal of this malevolent classic allows one to clear up many misconceptions about Nazism. For instance, we sometimes hear that the German people came to support Hitler without ever understanding his positions. MEIN KAMPF lays this notion soundly to rest!<br /><br />Some commentators doubt if National Socialism had actually been a form of socialism. It is therefore instructive that Hitler supported trade unions (pp. 874-876), and that the annotators of MEIN KAMPF recognized the fact that the Nazi economy had been a Planswirtschaft (planned economy; p. 880).<br /><br />Traditional Christian theology, about Jews and deicide, is often blamed for the Holocaust. We learn instead that Hitler's pathological hatred of Jews had NOTHING to do with Christian theology. In fact, the only time that Hitler even touched on this issue was when he asserted that Jews crucified Christ for having opposed their commercialization of the Temple (p. 423). Indeed, Hitler saw Jews as a parasitic element that takes the hard-earned wealth of others. They did this through such things as becoming intermediaries in trade, and through usury (pp. 419-on). When the masses rebel against this exploitation (as through pogroms), the Jews ingratiate themselves to the rulers for protection. No matter how many times they are persecuted, Jews will always return to their ingrained exploitative ways (p. 427). Furthermore, Jews will, according to Hitler, resort to all forms of mendacity and slander in order to protect their privileged, exploitative positions. Such things as Jewish assimilation, philanthropy, and conversions to Christianity are nothing but disguises to further Jewish ends. Hitler was unfazed by the fact that the PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION were inauthentic. To him, the Jewish reaction against this publication was itself proof of its authenticity (p. 424). Finally, whether themselves authentic or not, the PROTOCOLS were supposed to constitute a valid appraisal of Jewish attitudes and goals.<br /><br />Hitler unambiguously believed that only Germanic peoples invent things (pp. 397-398). The creativity of a society is directly proportional to the Germanic content of its stock and inversely proportional to the degree of \\"bastardization\\" with inferior races. The Fuhrer made countless racist statements against Slavs. Hitler repeatedly lamented the fact that the admixture of Jews and Slavs had polluted the Germanic element of his native Austria (e. g., pp. 138-140). The Fuhrer also contended that Slavs have no capability of self-government--their rulers must all be of Germanic origin (p. 951). Hitler was no white supremacist; he was a German supremacist par excellence!<br /><br />Proponents of Holocaust uniqueness sometimes claim that, whereas there was nothing that Jews could do to change their standing in the eyes of the Nazis, Poles could redeem themselves by undergoing Germanization. This is fallacious. Hitler said, \\"Here too one believed that one could bring about a Germanization of the Polish element by a purely linguistic integration into the German nationality. Here too the result would have been an unfortunate one: people of an alien race, expressing its alien thoughts in the German language, compromising the height and the dignity of our own nationality by its own inferiority.\\" (p. 590). (During the later German occupation of Poland, the \\"Germanization\\" of selected Poles was actually a re-Germanization of ethnic Germans who had previously become Polonized.)<br /><br />We sometimes hear the claim that the German people voted for Hitler, in free elections, without realizing the fact that he would start a major war. Perhaps, some say, Hitler would be, at worst, content with a little war to rectify the \\"injustices\\" of Versailles. In actuality, there is much more to MEIN KAMPF than the customary German self-pity regarding WWI and Versailles. Clear proof that the Fuhrer had long planned a war of massive conquest and extermination, against the Slavic peoples, is provided by his following statements regarding lebensraum: \\"Neither eastern nor western orientation should be the future goal of our foreign policy, but an eastern policy signifying the acquisition of the necessary soil for our German people.\\" (pp. 965-966). (Later, the Nazis spoke of \\"resettlement\\" of Jews and Slavs. In time, \\"resettlement\\" evolved into a euphemism for extermination.)ng planned a war of massive conquest and extermination, against the Slavic peoples, is provided by his following statements regarding lebensraum: \\"Neither eastern nor western orientation should be the future goal of our foreign policy, but an eastern policy signifying the acquisition of the necessary soil for our German people.\\" (pp. 965-966).

0765350386|5.0|Picked up this entire series as a recommendation and fell in love immediately. By far one of the best series, let alone books, I have read.
0321701763|4.0|The book was recommended to me by Microsoft when I purchased CS5.  I find the format easy to follow. The book takes me through a lesson and then has a quiz at the end.
B0058HDHHI|4.0|The Kooks never fail to deliver. This album is great, but I have to say it's not their best. Some of their songs sound very generic, like some top 40's pop song. However, a lot of them reminds oneself of why we all love the Kooks. All in all, I'll have to say it's a great purchase :)
0060512806|3.0|There are some terrific parts to this novel!  Bobby Steptoe deserves a sequel.  And Lawrence Waterhouse is endlessly fascinating.  The modern plot thread really doesn't pan out as much as one might hope.  Stephenson can be very funny.  BUT IT'S NOT WORTH 900 PAGES!  You have been warned.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I really wasn't expecting a lot from another comic book movie and surprise-surprise, I really really LOVED it! Great casts, AMAZING visual art, and little dash of romance for the girls. All in all, one of the most well-rounded, fun, action-packed, dramatic movie I've seen this year!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I've seen all the other Indiana Jones films and this one lives up to the excitement and action of the others.  Harrison Ford has still got it.
B000007NYS|5.0|I love Lucinda's newer music however this album is my favorite.  It is so raw and real.  If you love her music this one needs to be in your collection.
B005974CNA|2.0|To keep it short, the drums mix needed to stand out a bit more, part of why I love Dream Theater is that I love the way the drums sound when I turn this up in my car and Mr. Mangini is a awesome drummer. Other than that mixing, the songs and lyrics are pretty cool although there are one too many ballads.   Going back to their last album I am still listening to 1. A Nightmare To Remember  and 6. The Count Of Tuscany - love the mixes on those.
B005974CDU|2.0|Before I start, I need to say that Mangini is awesome! I just think that this is much weaker material overall. \\"Outcry\\" is fantastic and \\"On the Backs..\\" rocks but I can't get into the rest of it as a longtime DT fan. I guess that I have enjoyed the progression into heavier tunes over the years and expected this one to be less metallic, however I didn't expect so much of a slowdown.
B0058FOB2K|5.0|she did it again, great album, amazing vocals, songs you can relate to and songs you can dance too, beyonce is simply the greatest of our times,0 stars to the prize because for 30 dollars i can get 2 deluxe at target.

B000N3ST3Y|3.0|I have heard that Marrillion was copying Genesis and that's why I wanted to take a closer look at Genesis (which I knew anyway from the TV or radio). The verdict - the copy is much better than original! No matter how you look at it, Marillion puts quite a lot of intellect into the orchestration and arrangements of theirs songs. Genesis sounds flat and raw - their songs are often based on a simple riff that is repeated for full 5 minutes. The whole album sounds OK but is quite unexciting. Would I recommend it? Yes, they are part of rock history

1609611543|5.0|I started reading this book while working on a complete overhaul of my diet, and I'm so glad that I did. I was considering a veggie-based diet, but was still planning on including wheat, but since just the first chapter I cut wheat and gluten completely out.<br /><br />In this book, Dr. Davis is clearly explains and correlates the connection between wheat and so many health problems that we have in the US. It's scary the number and range of diseases affected by modern wheat; it truly is \\"the staff of death.\\" We all know that breads and carbs are not good for us to over-consume, but to know that they are dangerous and can even contribute to psychological issues and long-term irreversible illnesses is a different story.<br /><br />Reading this book made it much easier to cut wheat and glutens from my diet, and in doing so I found how effortless it was to keep them out. The cravings for wheat go away, food urges are far less frequent and never urgent, I eat less overall, and enjoy the food that I eat more than ever before. All that, plus I've lost weight, have more energy, think more clearly, and stomach and headaches (even migraines) have disappeared. If the results I've seen and felt were somehow packaged and sold in pill-form, it would be a wonder drug. I never would have known that all I had to do was eat differently.<br /><br />Thank you Dr. Davis for sharing this info. I believe it will truly change lives.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I recently bought a \\"new\\" old car -- a 1994 model -- with a GREAT radio/cassette sound system but no CD and certainly no MP3 features or auxiliary input jack. So I thought I would try an MP3 FM transmitter device. Many of the available products figure you want to simply tap your preferred portable personal MP3 device (most likely an iPod) into your car sound system. But I wanted a \\"dedicated in-car\\" device, preferably with SD-card and/or USB jump drive storage and the most useful features I could find.     I decided, too, that a device that either slipped into the cassette slot or plugged into the cigarette lighter plug would be the most convenient. With large capacity SD-cards and jump drives falling in price, I figured I could cheaply load up a ton and a half of tunes on the device and rarely, if ever, have to bother with changing its content.    So I started my on-line shopping hunt for my options. I found a number of candidate devices. Lots of super cheap options via eBay and a choice or two here on Amazon.    Many of these devices were so cheap that I figured I would try the \\"buy a few and at least one may work okay\\" strategy. Honestly, at first I ignored the Satechi Soundfly AUX because of its price.    After getting a few \\"cheap-o\\" devices in, I had confirmed the old saying, \\"You get what you pay for.\\" One broke and left hard-to-retrieve bits in the cigarette lighter and blew a fuse. One cassette device worked okay -- it was the only one I found that could work in the cassette width-wise slot I have -- but it had a built-in battery requiring that you eject and manually turn it on and off. One of the rather cheap cigarette lighter ones worked okay, but its very small LCD display showed only the \\"raw\\" folder and file names (8-char shortened and usually hidden) rather than the full MP3 album names and song titles.    So, realizing that, well, cheap is cheap, I decided to do a second round of trials. That is when I took a closer look at the Soundfly AUX.    Yes,it was the most expensive of the players I now have. But most expensive in this case is relative. Compared to ripping out a good radio/cassette and replacing it with a modern system, the Soundfly is a bargain!    Delivery once ordered was blazingly fast. A++ to the Satechi folks for that. My AUX also came in retail \\"display-worthy\\" plastic-protective packaging. And, believe it or not, it actually had  reasonable printed documentation. (Sounds funny, but a number of the items I bought came from China and likely had no packaging and printed material because they were not intended for USA retail sales.)    So, having the info I needed to install and configure the FM pre-sets, the digital 'equalizer', etc., it was fast and simple to get the Soundfly AUX in and working. The digital display has large and easily read \\"ticker-tape\\" style scrolling text for the ablum and song titles. The credit card small remote works great. All in all, a super \\"keeper.\\" Also, and its a small feature, the SD-card has a spring load socket and the card goes well into the device so it is not sticking out and subject to loss like some of the other devices I bought.    So, bottom line, I now have a BOATLOAD of great tunes on a 16 GB SD-card (not included) in my Soundfly which is playing rock-solid through my \\"new\\" old car's sound system. BOTH the Satechi folks and their AUX product are excellent.    Thanks, Satechi. Keep up the good work.
0545123291|5.0|I'm not going to lie, I ran out and bought Linger the day it was release on July 13th. I had bought two books in the same day and read the other first, but I read through Linger so fast, it was a great book.<br /><br />I fell in love with Sam and Grace in Shiver, and Linger did not disappiont me at all. There was an element to Linger that I seemed to enjoy a little more though. Switching back and forth between Cole, Isabel, Grace, and Sam showed that each character had their own problems and their own demons to fight, and I absolutely LOVED this. Each of them have to learn to deal and heal what their past has done to them: Cole with his music, Grace with her wolves and parents, Isabel with Jack and her parents, and Sam with his horrifying past and trying to figure out what his future has to hold.<br /><br />I really enjoyed all the romance and fighting through out the book, it was real. Everything is not perfect in real life. You fight, you cry, you get angry, and you do stupid things. Reguardless of those, you have to learn to deal. But, when you have something good you have to fight to hold onto it and don't let anything get in the way.<br /><br />I've read some reviews where people say this book was predictable. So what if it is? Think about all the chick flicks you go out to watch. Lets see.. hmmm... A Walk To Remember. Everyone knows she's sick and she's going to die in the end, yet you still love to watch her fall in love and cry at the end, but you still LOVE it anyway. (You go N.SPARKS for the awesome book)!<br /><br />I loved Linger and I can not wait to read FOREVER. :)

B0050SYS5A|1.0|Pre-ordered from amazon and rec'd on release day as promised.    My Kinect is located under the tv using the PDP Xbox 360 Kinect Floor Stand. I attached the Zoom w/o any problems or issues. Once I started the system, I knew right away that there was a problem as the Kinect couldn't detect my hand movements. I went through the calibration several times. The unit would have a hard time finding the floor. Even when it did I was never able to get it to recognize my body structure.     Just to make sure it wasn't the system, I removed the zoom and right away it detected my head and limbs. I continued to try to calibrate for over an hour before giving up. It wouldn't recognize me w/ Kinect ID either.    I'm returning the product as defective/does not work.
096501830X|5.0|I don't quite know how to put it any better than the title I gave this review... Bottom Line?<br /><br />Tom Clancy, James Patterson, Nelson DeMille...

B0043U98RY|5.0|This is a review of the entire first season.  After watching two seasons of 'Rome', I wanted to continue watching the exploits of the Roman Empire and I ran across this series. The special effects are great but some of the content is gruesome and hard to watch. The Romans played a dangerous game, they purchased then groomed male slaves to fight for profit and fame. Spartacus fights his way through the ranks to become the best Gladiator of all time.   He and his wife are torn apart and thrust into slavery and on some level he accepts his fate. What fuels him and pushes him to win are his dreams of reuniting with his wife but when he learns the treachery behind his wife's death, he forms an uprising with the other slaves.    The fighting scenes are well done but very bloody and there is nudity and sexual exploits galore, this one is rated for mature audiences only!
0439023513|5.0|This week, I work a total of around 48hrs. Full time job and I refused go to bed last night until I was finished with Mockingjay. I couldn't help myself and I could not stop reading. Suzanne Collins has done it again, and I can happily say I am very happy with the way the final installment turned out.<br /><br />This book has everything from destruction to fear and love to hate. There were some situations where I knew what was coming and others where I had no idea and was just \\"omg did that happen?\\". There are new characters in this installment, ones you will love and ones you will hate. And of course, all the character we know and love are somehow in book three.<br /><br />I was very, very pleased with how Mockingjay ended. Throughout the book, I'm not going to lie, I thought I was going to be disappionted... but I wasn't. Mockingjay is dark, and twisted and will pull at all your emotions. I was happy, I was disappionted, I was cheering them on, and sometimes I wanted to strangle someone.<br /><br />Such a great story, such a great series. I think humanity needs to learn from Mockingjay, and see what we could become. What could possibly happen with-in time. I'm so very happy with Mockingjay and it's thoughts are still lingering with me and I know they will continue too. 10 stars &lt;3

B005DC68NI|5.0|Let's Get Digital (How to Self-Publish, And Why You Should Do It) by David Gaughran<br /><br />I learned from the book- with an overview of the publishing business and how e-books are starting to affect the market. I read educated predictions of what the future might bring for the publishing industry.  The author walks you through the self-publishing process step by step with an engaging style. The wonderful thing about self-publishing and the e-book explosion is the fact that no one is determining for you what they think you might like to read. The reader has full freedom to determine for themselves what they will or will not be interested in. That is so liberating! No marketing person in a fancy suit, no bean-counter only interested in profit potential closes the gate for the reader with the advent of self-publishing. The reader has the power to choose for themselves and more of the profits go to the author, the one who laughed, cried, bled, and spent their creative juices actually producing the reading material.<br />There's a wealth of good advice in these covers and the author actually practices what he preaches in his book. There is a resource section and several highly motivating stories of self-publishing success stories included in this book as well. I really enjoyed this e-book and would say it is a must for everyone seeking info about self-publishing and dreaming of having their material out there to share with others. So, what are you waiting for???? Get back to your writing!!!
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|I bought this because I love Playing for Change and believe in the cause. I also had liked almost all of the music on the first CD. However, the first time or two I watched/listened to this, I wasn't sure I liked some of the songs and was wondering if I had made a mistake in buying it without more careful review. Now that I have watched/listened more, my doubts are fading. Songs that didn't have a familiar feel to them are now growing on me and there were some that I loved instantly. The video settings and shots are superb. \\"Imagine\\" at the end is intensely moving - that video alone is worth the purchase price. I do not purchase many CDs or DVDs but this was definitely worth buying.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I. Am. In. Love. With. This. Perfect. Romance. Craziness. Heart-pounding. Book. It is pure perfection. Hands down the best love story I have ever read. It will frustrate you, make you do happy dances, maybe even cry. Beautiful Disaster is straight up dope in book form. Travis Maddox... 'nuff said. :)<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster starts off with Abby who is a new freshman at Eastern University. She's finally far away from home with her best friend, America, and she's excited to start over fresh from her past life. Then, Abby meets the notorious Travis Maddox... the super sexy, tattooed, fighter that every girl wants to have a fling with. As they become closer, and she resists his charms, Travis (desperate to see Abby more) makes a bet with her on one of his fights. If Abby wins, he will go without sex for a month, but if Travis wins, Abby must live with him for a month. As they two push and pull against each other it could only lead to one thing... a beautiful disaster.<br /><br />I am so completely in love with this book, I just don't even know where to start. There were parts in this story where I literally wanted to rip my hair out, parts where I was laughing, others where my heart was breaking, and parts where I was overjoyed with happiness. I honestly was highlighting a quote on almost every other page... that's how much I loved these words. This book is a love story unlike any you will read, I promise you.<br /><br />Abby and Travis are too well matched, although neither believes the other is good enough for each other. Abby is a beautiful, smart girl who is desperate to start a new life. The last person she wants to get involved with is Travis, who reminds her of her old life. I just adored Abby. She was so strong, so sexy yet natural, with a smart head on her shoulders. Yes, there were times I wanted to slap her for being stupid and others where I wanted to hug her for standing up for herself.<br /><br />Oh Travis... Travis Maddox. It is impossible to not love this kid. Yes he's a fighter, which I don't totally approve of, but it does have that hot factor to it. He has tattoos... which is so sexy on certain guys and let me tell you Travis has got it! I may have been skeptical about Travis in the beginning of the book because I really don't like sleaze-bags shall I say? ...And let me tell you there was a few times I wanted to kick his ass from here to china because of it. But, that being said.. Travis is also incredibly smart, tormented, and caring. He protects and would do anything for the people he loves. And by the end of the book, I was totally head over heels for this kid. I waaaaant a Travis Maddox.<br /><br />There were other characters too of course who made this story for me. One in particular is Abby's best friend, America. I LOVED her. She is so witty and all around fun-loving with a brain. She is the ultimate best friend, and I would adore her as mine. Then, there is Shepley, who is Travis's cousin and America's boyfriend. I thought he played a good role as well and I think Shepley and America are perfect for each other as well! Lets see who else... oh Finch! Finch is a friend, and a comical one at that. Finch is always having you laugh through out the story, plus he's a good friend... what's not to love? And finally, I really enjoyed Travis' family. I thought they were funny as heck!<br /><br />I have to say, I love the age range of this book. It's set in a college setting with 18+ year olds, with drinking, and sex, parties, classes, tests, and fighting. Which is exactly the level I'm at and exactly what I love reading. This story involves so many things, jealously, family issues, love, betrayal, heart-break, torment, having fun, as well as using your brain along with your heart.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster covers so many topics and Jamie McGuire completely out-did herself with this one. This book is purely stunning. The wording is perfect. The story is perfect. The fighting is perfect. The love is perfect. My feeling after reading it was and is perfect. I still cannot get over how much I am in love with this story. As I said before, best love story I've ever read. A million stars out of five. If you have even considered reading this one, do it. You will not regret it.ll cannot get over how much I am in love with this story. As I said before, best love story I've ever read. A million stars out of five.

0143119788|4.0|This is a spy novel that is more of a cerebral experience than a visceral one.  It's a complex, intellectual chess game.  If you're a literary adrenalin junkie looking for your next fast-paced, action-packed fix, Tinker Tailor is not going to give you the thrills you crave.<br /><br />George Smiley is no action hero.  He's a pedantic, gloomy, mundane little man with a methodic, analytical mind and a keen eye for detail.  He seems more like a beleaguered civic bureaucrat than a spy master.<br /><br />The plot: Smiley has been forced into retirement, cast aside to make way for the new guard in the wake of a disastrous mission that results in a major shift in power at the Circus, the British Secret Service Headquarters.  He is drawn out of retirement, unofficially, to investigate whether or not there is a mole at the highest levels of the Service.  The suspects have been code named Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poorman and Beggarman.<br /><br />Le Carre is in no rush to unravel his tale, allowing the story to advance at a slow measured pace.  There are no cliffs to hang from.  Smiley delves into his own memories, pores through files, conducts interviews and gradually draws details from reluctant former colleagues.  He doesn't insult the reader's intelligence by providing too much detail, requiring the reader to figure much of what is happening out on their own.<br /><br />No spoon feeding here.<br /><br />The story itself is loosely based on actual events and is...well...complicated.  There are numerous players in the puzzle and a certain degree of commitment is required on the part of the reader to keep all the characters, subplots, and flashbacks straight.  In the end, it is a rewarding read and provides fascinating insight into Cold War era espionage.  As a novel though, I never felt fully engaged in the story.  It was an interesting novel, but I never really connected with it on any emotional level.  I was curious to see how the puzzle would be solved, but at the same time, I didn't feel like I was invested in the outcome.<br /><br />This is a smart novel that's well worth reading.  I appreciated its complexity and its insiders knowledge of the spy game even if I wasn't fully engaged by the characters and the story.ested in the outcome.

0525425578|5.0|The Theodore Boone books are well written and interesting. John Grisham has created a series that will appeal to middle school students. The books portray the day to day life of middle school students, promote healthy friendships, and subtly stress the importance of strong school performance.  As a retired teacher, I have enjoyed Grisham's understanding of kids at this age group and his obvious respect for them. The books have subtle humor and plausible subject matter. It is great to see books that have a higher level and interest for students in this age group. I have recommended these books to our school library and English teachers.    Natalie Daley
B000065PUE|5.0|No one who listened to the raw, churning, aggressive guitar melody of &#34;Levitate Me&#34;, the first track the Pixies ever recorded (and the last cut on their first release, &#34;Come On Pilgrim&#34;) could have mistaken it for a mutated sort of post-punk pop song or predicted that it would serve as a template for the quiescent/aggressive musical dynamic informing the band's iconic sound. And yet with the benefit of 25 years of hindsight, both statements seem pretty accurate to me. &#34;Doolittle&#34;, the band's third release, was the apotheosis of this juxtaposition between tuneful discordancy and an undeniable melodicism underlying  hooks large enough to hang Black Francis's Size XX flannel shirts upon, and in my opinion, the finest post-punk pop release to have been recorded, period.  Most of the tracks the Pixies recorded for &#34;Come On Pilgrim&#34; and &#34;Surfer Rosa&#34;, though quiescent in some parts, could be defined as possessing a sense of ferocious abandon, were often aggressively paced and frequently built toward a sense of sustained explosiveness.  And you'll still hear that on &#34;Doolittle&#34;, most notably on &#34;Tame&#34; , `Wave of Mutilation&#34;,&#34;I Bleed&#34;, &#34;Monkey Gone To Heaven&#34;, and &#34;Crackity Jones&#34;. Yet often an acoustic guitar could be heard complementing a bristling electric lead (first heard most prominently on &#34;Nimrod's Son&#34; from &#34;Come On  Pilgrim&#34;). &#34;Doolitle&#34; is the first CD where the quiescent/aggressive dynamic is built solidly from this mixture of electro-acoustical guitar interplay  (their breakout song &#34;Here Comes Your Man&#34;, revolves around this interplay), reaching its zenith on &#34;La La Love You&#34; and &#34;No. 13 Baby&#34;, leaving no doubt they were the spiritual descendants of Husker Du by way of Peter, Paul, and Mary.  Some reviewers have criticized Francis's lyrics for opaqueness and superficiality. But to me, it's precisely those lyrics that at first glance seem cryptic- yet containing just a tiny kernel of logic that could be deciphered- that added that extra amplification to the immediacy and urgency of the sound behind it. Significantly deviant behaviors (the real-life over-the-cliff-and-into-the-ocean vehicular suicides that inspired &#34;Wave Of Mutilation&#34;, the exhibitionism displayed by the &#34;six-foot girl&#34; in &#34;No. 13 Baby) rubs shoulders with  the spiritual (&#34;Mr. Grieves&#34;, perhaps drawn from Francis's Evangelical Christian upbringing, seems like an updated version of the old hymn &#34;Man of Sorrows&#34; ;&#34;Monkey Gone To Heaven&#34;, a severe indictment of the destruction humankind has wrought during their time spent in stewardship of the environment, juxtaposes the evolutionary fixation of mankind's supposed origins with the ascencion toward a Supreme Being after death for judgment; and both &#34;Dead&#34; a cryptical revision of David's dalliance with Bathsheba  and &#34;Gouge Away&#34; ,  a quirky re-telling of the  story of Samson and Delilah, are derived straight from the Old Testament), which brushes against the existential  &#34;I Bleed&#34;, with its universal query, &#34;Prithee my dear/why are we here?&#34;  that clicked with the macabre &#34;(Debaser&#34;, in which the slicing of eyeballs serves as a metaphor for the degradation of society through the pornographic display of sex and violence , as well as &#34;Crackity Jones&#34;, in which the song's protagonist is attempting to escape from a potentially homicidal agoraphobe). And nearly all of it is yelped, yowled, yodeled, whispered, or growled in Francis's Pentecostal roar, with Kim Deal's warm, husky vocals providing either harmony or counterpoint (and taking lead on &#34;Silver&#34;). David Lovering, the band's propulsive percussionist, sings lead on &#34;La La Love You&#34;, and is backed by the rest of his bandmates, giving his rich, expressive vocals a chance to serve as a focal point for once.  My review of &#34;Doolittle&#34; is the 262nd to have been added to this page, and you're probably encountering it because as of the date of its posting, it's the most recent review. Many other reviewers have stressed the influence of &#34;Doolittle&#34; as an ancestral link to the grunge movement, but I think it's a landmark recording because it incorporates significant features that are universally associated with a typical pop song with the more aggressive, discordant edge characteristic of post-punk music. Some of the rough edges have been polished away by the production values of Gil Norton, but it's only served to make &#34;Doolittle&#34; the most cohesive of the Pixies' releases; there's literally not a track without some kind of interesting wrinkle on it, and it's as compelling to listen to your thousand-and-first time as it is your first. I can't recommend it enough.
0142419400|5.0|At first, I was not sure what to expect of this. I defiantly was not expecting to fall in love with this book, but oh did I ever. Anna and The French Kiss is a romance unlike any other.<br /><br />We start off with Anna, who has a best friend and crush, but has to leave them all behind to go to The School Of America in Paris aka SOAP. After being shipped off to boarding school, she meets a new clique and a \\"masterpiece\\" of a boy named Etienne St. Clair. Etienne is perfect: he's funny, smart, dresses good, and is absolutely gorgeous. Did I mention he has a girlfriend? Oh right, well there's that too. Anna learns to fit in, have fun, and love Paris for everything it has to offer. As she starts to get closer to Etienne and Paris a world of change happens to Anna, and she learns that home is where you make it. :)<br /><br />This book was absolutely amazing. Anna is sassy, funny, smart, and adorable. Etienne is sexy among with everything else that rolls into his perfect little self. Her home life, and friends along the way create even more entrigue and drama, and make the story all worth while. I honestly, could not put this one down. I stayed up till 1:30am on a work night to finish it. This book has just the right amount of it all: friendships, parent relationships, site-seeing, partying, and romance. I absolutely ADORED Anna and Etienne's relationship, it couldn't have been more bloody perfect if they tried. This book will have you laughing, going \\"wtf\\", smiling, and falling in love. Defiantly pick this one up! 5 Stars! I cannot wait for Stephanie Perkin's next one.

B00008YJHC|4.0|No one I knew who listened to \\"Bossanova\\" upon its release 21 years ago was disappointed in the direction it took; for the most part, the quiescent/aggressive dynamic informing the band's sound was in plain evidence, the production values gave it a roomier and more expansive sound than \\"Doolitle\\" while still retaining an aggressive edge, Black Francis's lyrics were as cryptically poetic, and the group began incorporating the loping rhythm and reverberation of `60's surf music. And yet looking back in hindsight, \\"Bossanova\\" marks a transitional point in collaborative effort for the Pixies, one that wasn't necessarily beneficial; Black Francis asserted much more control over the material and somewhat diminished the active role Kim Deal had assumed during the rehearsals and recording for \\"Come On Pilgrim\\", \\"Surfer Rosa\\", and \\"Doolittle\\", eventually laying the ground for the dissolution of the Pixies.     This is evident in the level of participation in the group's dynamics allowed to her beyond laying down heavily pronounced basslines as one-half of the group's percussion section. \\"Silver\\" and Gigantic\\" had been her compositional contributions to \\"Doolittle\\" and \\"Surfer Rosa\\" respectively, but she was never given the chance to contribute material to \\"Bossanova\\", instead relegated to providing backing vocals for a bare minimum of tracks, including \\"Velouria\\", \\"Dig For Fire\\", and \\"Havalina\\", which is a shame, as her vocal chemistry with Black Francis was remarkable.     And while Black Francis's lyrics remained both cryptic and (at a certain level) spiritually profound, many of them revolve around topics some might be inclined to universally associate with science fiction. \\"Velouria\\", driven by raw, churning, somewhat aggressive guitar intersected by a tremolo, is about a time-traveler pursuing a love affair after his possible emergence through a dimensional portal to an alternate universe. \\"Ana\\", driven by brushed drums and a wonderfully reverbed guitar line, relates the tale of a gigantic alien surfer. Both driven by piano and heavily distorted gutiar, \\"The Happening\\" attempts to predict the reaction to a visible landing of an unidentified flying object. \\"All Over The World\\" introduces fish who apparently have the universal capacity for articulate speech, while a martial stomp and a punishingly aggressive, wriggling, angular guitar lead propels \\"Stormy Weather\\", which might very well be referring to some unnamed cataclysmic event so devastating that only one line (\\"It is time for stormy weather') comprises the lyrical content of the entire song.     \\"Bossanova\\" has more than enough to recommend it; though recorded as it was being written, it sounds fairly cohesive, and aside from \\"Velouria\\" and \\"The Happening\\", \\"Is She Weird\\" , \\"Dig For Fire\\", and \\"Stormy Weather\\" have all become an integral part of their canon. It's worn well with the passage of over two decades, and sounds fresh next to the death-laughs-forever, world-won't -listen, fashionably alienated heavy metal that's busily masquerading as \\"alternative rock\\" 21 years after its release. It's definitely worth grabbing, but do it in chronological order of release. Recommended.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|The biggest surprise?  I still like this visually bombastic movie.  Having seen it originally in IMAX 3-D, I was expecting a bit of a letdown.  While not in 3-D, this version may in fact add some clarity to the scenes.  From a visual and sonic level this is probably the best Blu-ray disc out there.  That's saying something with \\"Avatar\\" sitting on the shelf.  The cycle chases are spectacular, clear and exciting.  The Daft Punk soundtrack is a perfect match for this film.  I can't remember a better synch of sound and vision.  What's missing is a better story, but hey this is silly cyberspace so I can accept the existing premise.  Unfortunately, with all the attention given to the technology, the filmmakers gave us characters without a wisp of emotion.  For example, when Flynn (Jeff Bridges) sees his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) for the first time in 20 some years, you would expect more than grabbing his shoulders and saying \\"how ya' doin'.\\"  Olivia Wilde's character Quorra is expected to be cool.  After all she's an isochip.  But she warms up along the way.  Sam?  It's like she's his pet dog or something.  Hey dummy, it's Olivia Wilde!  Overall, this is a wildly entertaining movie.  Just sit back, crank it up and let it wash over you.
B000QQUF9Y|5.0|I love Tony Banks' work in general and this too is high quality, though it's not really that innovative from a classical music perspective. Still, it's quite pleasant to listen to and it does have some strong melodic and harmonic moments. But I can only recommend it to fans of Mr. Banks.  I do look forward to his second attempt, apparently in the works.

0767827902|5.0|According to director Peter Bogdanovich, he made this movie on location in Archer City, Texas in 2 months and spent another 6 months editing.  By his own admission, he didn't know many of the technical aspects of filmmaking so reworking the prints was necessary.  In the end, he got it all right.  Shot in glorious black and white in order to promote the grim, bleak decay of a small Texas town, the film also gives us a complex set of characters.  With the exception of Best Supporting Actor winner Ben Johnson, the cast was mostly unknown actors at the time.  This is model Cybill Shepherd's first role.  Bogdanovich shot the film using traditional camera techniques.  In addition to an established color pallet, most films of the era were being produced by directors experimenting with hand held cameras, quick cuts and special effects.  \\"Picture Show\\" exhibits like the era it portrays, 1951-1952 dusty Texas.  Bogdanovich doesn't use a musical score.  Instead he uses the music of the day with an emphasis on Hank Williams.  In fact a couple shots feature an old 45 rpm changer and of course a jukebox.  By my count there are 8 or 9 central characters and Bogdanovich manages to flesh out each one so we know who they are and what they represent.  For the most part the central focus is on Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) a graduating high school senior who comes to realize, life isn't getting any better, but seemingly has no options.  The film was controversial at the time.  It showed a change in American demographics as people were leaving the small towns that dotted the country for bigger cities that had more opportunities.  \\"The Last Picture Show\\" is replete with nudity, adultery and sex.  While this was not unheard of at the time, the context of it being in the lives of regular small town citizens was.  The screenplay was adapted from Larry McMurtry's book of the same name.  He grew up in Archer City, so I suspect all the events really happened, even if the characters may have differed.  The film was hailed by critics at the time but lost the Best Picture Oscar to \\"The French Connection\\".  With this his second film Peter Bogdanovich solidified his place in film history with this brilliant masterpiece..

0679746323|5.0|After exhaustive documental, bibliographic, testimonial, and iconographic research, the authors put together the puzzle of this personality, one of the defining characters of the XX Century, although only of its miseries, and not of its wonders. A century of excess, which saw the greatest scientific advances of history, as well as enormous changes in society and the economy, but which also saw Humankind's descent into the deepest abyss of degradation, injustice, violence, and cruelty. It is only this second, darker, face of the century that Mao embodies. It is impossible to think of a human being - Hitler and Stalin included - who ever inflicted more damage, in a more cruel and cold way, and for so long, to more humans. In this sense, in Mao everything is big. Like most revolutionaries, subversives, despots, authocrats, and the like, Mao was never poor. He was born in a small town in the Hunan province, a child of merchants. Mao had the chance to go to school, but he never stood out. From an early age he had an overpowering ambition, as well as an absolute indifference towards any other persons. So, politics became his obvious career choice. Especially the chaotic Chinese politics of the early century, including the (very real) Japanese threat, the Russian Revolution, and the division between Nationalists and Communists, of which the peasants were nothing but victims. Into that turbulent river Mao went fishing, based on treason, simulation, and humiliation - both the abject ones he was willing to put up with, and the even worse ones he inflicted unto others. With unusual audacity and hair-raising cruelty, Mao kept changing sides until his status began to grow within the Communist Party, always more hated and feared than respected. It hurts to say this, but with the exception of two or three minor stumbles, Luck was always on his side, throughout his entire life.     His first opportunity to gather his own troops, money, territory and a reputation came in the \\"Land of Bandits\\", Jinggiang, in China's Southeast. From there, he began to build his own power-base. The second and decisive chance came with the Long March, an indeed long and absurd retreat to the North, in search of territorial contact with the Russians in order to get their help. Mao's all-powerful propaganda machine of later would transform, lie by lie, this rather embarrasing flight into a glorious and epic chapter. Then came the audacious kidnap of Chiang Kai-shek; war with Japan, in which Mao fought his internal rivals and Chiang, not the Japanese; the Soviet intervention; and at last, Mao's supremacy over the Party, thanks to a horrible mistake made by the American General Marshall, who saved him from destruction and forced Chiang into exile. From all this came the totalitarian state and a life of excess and opulence.     Up to there, the boundless ambitious had managed to conquered his vast country. Now it was time to conquer the world; this is no conjecture: he was repeatedly explicit about it. His former abjection and self-humiliation in front of Stalin became open challenge, with succesive reckless manoeuvres which nobody else would have even dreamed of to do to the fearsome Soviet boss. The biggest of them all was to provoke war in Korea, which put Stalin between a rock and a hard place. This war was a central part of Mao's ultimate goal: to become a nuclear superpower and dominate the world. To add to that end, he launched the \\"Great Leap Forward\\", which consisted in returning the Chinese to the Stone Age by exporting lots of food (and thus starving his own people) in exchange for the most sophisticated weapons systems available. Tens of millions of people died during that crazy, evil experiment, after which Mao subjected Tibet; built his awesomer propaganda machinery (aided by countless Western \\"useful fools\\"); last-minute salvation from his number-two's, Liu Shaoqui, attempted coup; the stupid and counterproductive Cultural Revolution; and finally, his personal decadence, but not the demise of his regime, which lives on.    From among the many characters in this macabre drama, four deserve special mention: Liu Shaoqui, his second in command, and Peng Dehuai,  minister of Defense, both of whom finally opened their eyes and tried to stop him, but were tortured to death; Jian Zemin, the repellent adulator and chief diplomat; and his fourth wife, Madame Mao, a former prostitute who deserves a description as a madhouse bird. There is little doubt that Mao suffered from a severe personality disorder, which made it impossible for him to perceive the least value or feelings in other people. His egomania and brutality have no possible comparison. Leaving bodies by the side of the road, right and left, betraying everybody, including his own family, and spreading death and misery, the Great Myth was created, the repugnant figure of the \\"Great Helmsman\\".    Don't get lost in minutiae about this-or-that exact source for this particular story. Get the message, which is none other than this man was a monster. Instead of trying to find something redeemable about him, think of the millions who suffered, died, and were humiliated to extremes by this horrible, vicious man. Take a look at the treatment he gave his four wives and his children. This book is a great contribution to the understanding of History and the depths of human nature.
B00007KWI9|5.0|Yes' first album was recorded in the Spring and released in July 1969 with the line up consisting of Jon Anderson (then spelled John), Chris Squire, Peter Banks, Tony Kaye and Bill Bruford. It was produced by Paul Clay. The album was released with two different covers with one for Europe and another for America although the album failed to chart in either place.<br /><br />As for the album itself, it starts off with a rather hard edged song called Beyond And Before written by Chris Squire and Clive Bailey. Next up, the band absolutely splendid version of The Byrds' I See You that blows the original out of the water. This isn't a by the numbers cover but rather Yes puts their own stamp on it and makes it their own. Yesterday and Today is a beautiful ballad written by Jon Anderson and shows that he already had a natural talent for these sorts of things. Looking Around ends the first half of the original album on a strong note. The second half begins with Harold Lane and is followed by a smoking take of The Beatles' Every Little Thing which the band, once again, reinvents. Sweetness is full of...well...sweetness. Survival ends the original album on a strong note. The bonus tracks include two different versions each of Everydays, Dear Father and Something's Coming. The sound quality on this remaster is top notch.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard is an amazing woman.  Her story is difficult to read because it is so tragic and heartbreaking.  But her positive outlook and sincere gratitude for life are nothing short of inspiring (and unbelievable at times).  Certainly puts things in to perspective to be thankful for your life-every single day (even the \\"bad\\" ones).  It's a short read (she was abducted at the age of 11 so she didn't formally go to school after that, so the writing itself is basic but correct.  She's a very intelligent person, as well as very brave and optimistic).  Be prepared to cry.

0307917509|1.0|I had hoped to be as engaged with  this book as I was with the Millennium Trilogy, but nooooo I was confused, bored and ultimately mad that I had spent actual cash for this book. The author is trying to create a cool hero but he just leaves you cold. The motivation of Hole is never clear and the route to his conclusions and detective ability is a slippery slop of assumption without the background to base those assumptions on, one wonders how he makes such clever deductions without even some description of his thought process!  The timelines are confusing, and tell me how someone can build a huge snowman in a second story bedroom without it melting or someone seeing and wondering why someone is hauling all this snow into the house? Really!! Perhaps it loses a lot in translation. My advice, don't even bothering getting this from the library!

Many of the songs herein were performed by both the original Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne solo as well as covered by bands too numerous to mention. It stands the test of time.

I didn't own it before this set, but the double In the Flesh (and DVD of same) is a great live show in it's own right, but there's only one new song there.  Too bad Roger only released 3 rock albums of original material in his solo career.  The recent Wall tour was awesome, but get back to work on new material, Rog!  I didn't own the original of the opera discs, probably won't listen to these remasters of it any time soon either, hence only 4 of 5 stars.
1933633867|5.0|When you are dealing with the so called 'Great Questions' about human nature, a comprehensive and thorough account of the latter is fundamental, otherwise you end up with the strange fantasies of most Western philosophers of the last centuries and contemporary economists. Also you end up with pernicious moral consequences. In this book, David Graeber goes through a very wide (and therefore very compelling) anthropological record of the most diverse facets that the phenomenon of debt has assumed throughout history, questioning the ethical dimension that it has taken in very recent time. I think that its timeliness and importance are great considering the fact that debt is always at the center of political and moral debates as well as being something for which the world economic structure is what it is
0307887898|2.0|Having studied the lean start-up methodology in business school, I was eagerly awaiting this book to see what insights Ries would have for its readers. Instead, I found myself quite disappointed. The concepts that he writes about in his book (when to pivot, iterate quickly, testing) are readily available throughout many other blogs and sites. You certainly don't need to buy this book to get the concepts.    In fact, when evaluated against other entrepreneurial start-up/go-to-market/strategy books such as Christensen's Innovator's Solution or Steve Blank's Four Steps to the Epiphany - this book is actually very basic. For tech entrepreneurs - Guy Kawasaki's book: The Art of the Start is leaps and bounds better than this one.     Pros: If you are starting your company for the first time (specifically a tech company) and have no idea what you're doing, you can use this book for some basic (and repetitive) concepts.    Cons: Too much self promotion. Too much repetition of basic concepts. And boring, unengaged stories about companies that we read about all the time.    I'd suggest saving the money, doing a quick google search on \\"lean start-up\\", and reading some of the books I mentioned above.
1594744769|3.0|Every so often I dip my toe into the YA pool, and I heard great things about this title.  I was intrigued by the premise and the style, and judging by the reviews, I figured I'd be treated to a haunting, somewhat scary ghost story.  It didn't really deliver what I figured it would, and the only haunting thing about the book were the many photographs that helped tell the story.  This was an incredibly interesting device that gave the book a unique flavor, but beyond that, there was something very familiar with the writing that turned me off.  It was much more whimsical than I imagined, which I suppose gave it a magical feel, but if you're the type to judge a book by it's cover, you might be disappointed by the actual story.      That said, it's an enjoyable enough read and definitely something a little different, even in a genre where monsters and the supernatural are as ubiquitous as dust.  I understand that this is part of a series and I'd be willing to check out the next books to see where the author takes it.

B003L77GGK|3.0|I love supernatural & I have from the start,From the beginning I was drawn in by the Monsters,The music,The Impala & the boys seasons 1-5 are amazing my fiance & I have been waiting for the 6th season to come out so we can see what happens to the boys after Sam takes a dive into the hole,But I have to sadly say this season was very disappointing.The sixth season makes you asks a lot of questions but doesn't give you all the answers even as the season unravels more.It seems like they truly did try to throw what ever they could against the wall & hoped it would stick unfortunately they tried to jump the shark a little too much,I liked the story line they had started going after with the Alphas & The mother of all but then they went no where with it just stopped after two or three episodes some of the 'Monsters' had good potential but were not given the proper justice they should have the Dragon episode is a great example I like the idea but hate how they presented it just a body of a human male with bat wings which were shown for a small glimpse they could have done a bit more for the dragon role,they didn't offer full creatures like were used to the Wendigo is a great example,Great looking creature in Creature form not a Human like the dragon & Phoenix I would have preferred to see something more as I know others would have liked to seen as well. I agree with many things other reviews have said about this season its not the best 7 I wish they would have stuck with the good thing they had. My fiance is a big supernatual lover as well who feels the same,He has made a comment they he wished he didn't waste our money on the sixth season he was ready to just turn it off a few times. Season six has some good points but over all was very disappointing,Wasn't anything I expected there were at least two episodes I wouldn't want to watch again & there's not really an episode I can say I truly loved I am not super picky I normally loved anything this crew does but I just can't stand behind season six.stand behind season six.

030788743X|2.0|This book grabbed me right away. The apocalyptic future, the 80s geek references, even the story. It's a lot of fun and a good quick read.     As I continued, though, the book's flaws began to stand out more and more, until the whole experience ended up empty.    The dialogue was choppy and clumsy the whole way through, especially from the villains.    The utter lack of nuance: to me, compelling protagonists have flaws and compelling villains have some connection to humanity. Or, if they don't start out that way, they develop. All of the characters here were one-note: the good guys were good, and the bad guys were bad, through and through.    the 80s references: at first, these were tons of fun. the more that were added, it got a little dense, but still- okay, I see what he is doing. However, these old games, movies, and TV show references eventually devolved from nostalgia to a deus ex machina that provided easy \\"outs\\" any time the plot took the protagonist into a difficult place without an apparent solution.    There were plot holes and inconsistencies throughout, and a exposition-centric writing style more suited for young adult lit.    It was a fun read, like I said, but in the end, disappointing.
0316098329|3.0|Donaghue's \\"The Room\\" left me at the edge of my seat. That is, until, about one third of the way through the book. After this point, I felt abandoned by the author. The novel simply cannot be described as well-written, but has subtle thematic elements that can mesmerize a reader. I would have liked for more internal dialogue, but in general, it is a book worthy of reading, as it goes quickly and fluidly. The childish slang used by the narrator left me, to my surprise, feeling slightly annoyed. At best, the novel was easy, interesting, and maintained my attention. At worst, it was depressing and lacking sophistication.

B004LSJCJM|5.0|I've been a Joe B. fan for about 6 years now. Saw him live twice here in SoCal and he is amazing live. His recordings have always been pretty good, from the early ones with mostly covers to his later ones where he has written more and more songs himself. The exception, in my opinion, being Black Rock, which I didn't like much, especially the sound quality of the recording. I'd have to say that Dust Bowl is much more along the lines of \\"Ballad of John Henry\\" but with a more complex character. The recording quality is fairly good and he breaks some new ground here. It goes without saying that Joe is a fantastic guitar player but it seems as though he's getting a clue that playing is not all flash and should also create a mood for the listener, with well-placed notes and musical nuances that just weren't there earlier. Way to go Joe; You're on the right path IMHO    D-man
B0034KZE9U|4.0|i bought these to wear in my own kitchen. i do not work in a restaurant or kitchen - i merely love to cook at home in my tiny nyc apartment kitchen.    i'm normally a 6.5 - 7 size (womens) shoe. i got pretty wide feet. i got these in size 7, and they fit very well. they were just a little bit tight on the very top, closest to my ankle. but i have that problem in other shoes (particularly rain boots) so i think that's just me.    i like to put the heel strap forward, so it's not behind my foot. my first impression was that my feet got very hot. i wore these barefoot in my own kitchen. granted, it's late summer and very humid, so it might just be the climate. overall, very pleased with my purchase, especially since they were on sale.

Besides that like I said this is a GREAT movie. The avatars look just like the real people. The movements they make are so real. You wont want to miss out on this movie.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I am only half way through John Locke's book, \\"How I sold...\\" and I had to stop reading and start writing a review.  Why?  I will tell you.  I was the first Flight Attendant ever to sign a big money 3 book deal with a division of Random House,  (yes, I'm the Marsha Marks who wrote, Flying by the Seat of my Pants...flight attendant adventures on a wing and a prayer)  but, after writing and selling 4 books in 5 years via traditional publishing, I was MAJORLY disillusioned by the entire traditional publishing judgernut.  Honestly, I needed to take 5 years off, just to recover from the stress and shock of what really goes on when you get what you'd throught would be wonderful, a \\"traditional respected publisher to pay you for the right to sell your words\\".<br /><br />So, at the end of my 5th year of recovering from publishing, I decided to get back into publishing, but this time I wanted to do E books and have control over what I write.  Enter John Locke with his book...\\"How I sold...\\".  The fact of the matter is, he has hit the proverbial nail on the head.  John Locke is so right on about the horrors of letting someone else put you under contract and tell you what you can and can't write and so, spot on about the costs and time involved in promoting the book you have then written - and quite frankly so easy to understand in how to write a successful e-book...well, I'll just say here, that this book is easily worth 10 times the price.  I'm currently working on my own e-book and am going to follow his advice to a T.<br /><br />Every published writer should read this book, as well as every wanna-be published writer.  His advice on how to write your book should be required reading for ANY writer out there - ebook or not.<br /><br />I've already called two of my friends and recommended this book and I'm going to reference it in my next e book.  This is a FANTASTIC book .  And may I just say, oddly enough, I am not a fan of bawdy writing, so it's not that I am in love with any of John Lockes other books - I think this fact gives my positive review of \\"How I sold ...\\" even more weight!ther books - I think this fact gives my positive review of \\"How I sold ...\\" even more weight!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I am impresssed by this album from Lady Antebellum. They are really improving. Not only with the sound, but the lyrics and the vocals. Every song has a nice tune to it, and I really believe they deserve a lot more for this album. I have always liked Lady A, but this album makes me love them. This album was really worth the wait. This album is 5 stars because I love it, and this shows improvement. Every song is great!<br /><br />Must buy!

159514188X|3.0|Since you already know she killed herself it kind of loses momentum towards the end. I think this is a great book for teenagers or even middle school aged kids. Adults also could benefit from it. It really shows how the words we say can impact people in ways we never imagined.
1416596585|4.0|I thought it was deeply insightful and telling of the making of Google plus their history from inception to early 2011. I did find that Stephen Levy may have lost some journalistic objectivity by his wonderment of the company and their significant accomplishments. I didn't feel he represented the reasonable criticisms of Google's practices such as stealing wifi data from their Streets View project, their acquisition spree (much like a Microsoft pre-Anti Trust) of smaller and competing technologies, and their desires to dominate every aspect of the internet. Or even how they are getting their ass kicked by Facebook. Also, he idolizes Google's significant perks like doctor onsite, meals, gyms, showers, day care, doggy service, etc where I see that as a way to have their employees working longer hours and effectively less time to personal development/families/personal hobbies (Don't Be Evil!). Still, the book was quite exceptional in telling the Google story.
B0054N73EY|3.0|I heard their radio release and immediately said I liked it, because I wanted to believe that RHCP were coming back with something HUGE, but in reality I didn't like it. This goes for the whole album after I listened to it. It's overall more poppy than their older stuff, which seems like an oxymoron when talking about RHCP - like a volvo with a gun rack. I'm going to continue to listen to the album to get what I can out of it, but generally disappointed. I wouldn't get your hopes up if you're looking for traditional RHCP.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|A captivating movie throughout and filled with suspense and intriguing characters. A charming film filled with a web of mystery. Fantastic adaptation to Dickens' novel.

0307887898|4.0|This is an important piece of work. Assumptions are often the enemy of great ideas. Bad ideas too often deplete our precious time and resources.  Today we must continuously improve our offerings just to remain relevant. But the failure rate for new products is high.  And the cost of bringing new products to market is also high. The Lean Startup method addresses both of those harsh realities.     This book is an important leap forward in the thinking behind how we get to market.  It's an approach which fits nicely with the increased pace and connectivity that drives the modern marketplace. Entrepreneurs and product teams have a lot of important and difficult hurdles to jump in order to find success, sustain it, and grow it.  We have to be fast, smart and nimble. We have to create and activate value where it's never existed before. We need to continuously validate our path throughout many cycles of uncertainty. Unlike many other business books I've read, this book gives teams and organizations the tangible advantages that can make the difference between success and failure, both short and long term. This is a must read for Startup founders, and product developers.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|If you're looking for a non-stop heart pumping thriller with punk rock blaring in the background to get you stoked before your pre-run, this might not necessarily be for you. The Art of Flight is an amazing film that documents snowboarding in a unique perspective that many don't get to see. With its ambient and electric indie soundtrack, narrative voice-overs expressing the thoughts and emotion of riders, and breath taking HD views panning across your flatscreen in Slow-Mo, The Art of Flight is an artistic ballet of adrenaline that will capture many!
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|A great film. It was captivating to watch the development of the relationship between the two main characters. It was slow to start but the development of the plot, acting and the unfolding relationship between Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester was just brilliant. Great settings too.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I had never heard of this author, and was amazed at the sample, so purchased the first 4.  I didn't know at that point that the series didn't end with 4.  I was so caught up in it, I couldn't stop (not much else got done).  The non-end irritated me severely, but bought book 5, thinking all things would come together.  My first thought at the end was WTF??  Not only did it not end, it didn't get anywhere.  Now, I'm p*ssed at having spent my money on an endless rollercoaster ride, and even worse, I'm bored with it.  I'd like to know how it ends, but by the time the next book comes out, I'm going to have forgotten half the characters and won't care.  I'll save my money & get it from the library.  Maybe.
0811876373|5.0|The book CAKE POPS by Bakerella (Angie Dudley) was everything I hoped it would be. It explained step by step every cake pop in the book. The illustrations made the directions easy.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|The Beatles Stereo Box Set has everything that is Beatles.  Besides all the LP records, I truly enjoy the Past Masters CDs so I can play the best and favorite of their songs.

Of course I loaded my unto my iTunes and iPhone so I can listen to them at home and away.  It is truly worth every penny spent.

1591842972|1.0|I read a lot. So much so I have a Prime membership and a bookshelf that is bursting.  I was so hoping that this was a biography of sorts even if not an official one.  It was not, it was a magazine article by a magazine article writer and nothing else.  Playboy's article on Steve Jobs is more in depth than this. That is how bad it is.  Not only was I surprised by the brevity in which the author touched each subject I also noticed the lack of depth he seemed to have purposely aimed for.  This book is also tiny a brief \\"7.3 x 5.3 x 1.1 inches\\" and with enlarged fonts to fill the space seemed to be of the Reader Digest release than a real book.  If you are thinking of buying a biography/history of Steve Jobs wait for the book by Walter Isaacson instead, same price and actually includes interviews from Steve Jobs himself.

B003OOWLU6|4.0|Well you don't find a story of love about two people caught in a time rift every day, okay...well you do. There are a lot of them in the same genre of 'Stranger in Time' and 'Time and Again' but rarely, if ever, do you find the romantic interests between the two lead guys. That's right, the dudes find each other dare to feel what they feel and then step out on the dance floor of life and own it. Honest sentiment, well acted, and as always...time wins. This episode has a great, authentic 40's feel and the actor playing 1943 Captain Jack nails it.

B003O4M4OY|4.0|This episode is a bit of a departure from the usual scenario of alien crazy messes with the world. Here we have the simple plot of three people from the past landing in modern Cardif and facing all the reality of losing love, finding it, and creating new lives. It is very reminiscent of the original Star Trek episode of 'City on the Edge Forever.' It is more character and emotionally based than the usual techno-gadgets and flashy action. Nice change of pace and well acted by all...and I'm not a romantic at heart.

0307389839|5.0|He mind-read my diary, nailing the psychology of running and writing. I especially loved the early chapters--first printed in the New Yorker--about quitting his job running a bar to devote himself to writing. He philosophizes beautifully about the solitude and endurance required of the writing life and how similar that is to distance running. At times it felt too much like a training diary, rather than a personal journey, but it is a powerful look inside the soul of a runner and writer.

B000TGJ80I|4.0|I could not wait to get in to the theater to see this film, as I'm a huge horror fan, but more specifically, a huge Werewolf fan & running a close second, Vampires. So a movie pitting the two against each other was just to much for me to resist! Was I disappointed?<br /><br />Hell, no!<br /><br />Despite all the bad rap this movie got as a horror clone to \\"The Matrix,\\" fighting sequences, guns, the Vampire's black dress, especially, Selene's, this movie is it's own film. Filled with action, great effects, good story line, & fast paced, \\"Underworld\\" put a stake right through my heart! Especially good was Michael Sheen's character, \\"Lucian,\\" feral, but sophisticated, he stole the show as the leader of the Lycans. Also particularly good was Bill Nighy's, \\"Viktor,\\" one of the three leaders of the Vampire clan. His character was at once commanding, intelligent, & sublimely evil, all that you could want from a Vampire!<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale's main character, \\"Selene,\\" was very well done in portraying hard determination of hunting Lycan's without mercy. Digging out Kraven's plans to take over the Vampire clan using Lycans, but also an undeniable vulnerability toward Scott Speedman's other main character, \\"Michael Corvin.\\" Michael Corvin was descended from the original immortal, Alexander Corvinus, who the Lycans feel will end the long war between them & the Vampires, by combing the cells of the two species into a super hybrid.<br /><br />Also in this Blu-ray version there is about an extra five minutes of footage that really helps flesh things out.<br /><br />I do have some complaints though. Scott Speedman's, \\"Michael Corvin\\" character was the weakest link in the chain acting wise, but I suppose in retrospect this was intended, for he had not a clue what was happing to him. Shane Brolly's character, \\"Kraven\\" was shrill & shallow, one wonders how he could orchestrate a coup over the Vampire clan, but also in retrospect, his character seems to fit in with the movie the more times it's viewed. I was disappointed in the lack of tooth & fang Vampire, Lycan confrontation, opting instead for guns & technology, but then again, retrospect wise, we don't fight our wars with sticks & stones anymore, so why should the Vampires & Lycans? One more thing, where are the female Lycans? Not nary a one to be seen in this film? With all this hairy tooth & fang machismo \\"Rin Tin Tin\\" going on, I think these male werewolves would enjoy a little soft furry support from a hot Lassie???<br /><br />All in all though, this movie satisfies the horror fan in me, there is some flaws, but only enough for me to fault this movie very little. If you want hot Vampire vs. Werewolf action, this is the place to start!<br /><br />4 stars out of 5 = Classicmore times it's viewed.

B005COO1X6|2.0|Of all that I've read by Stephen King, I feel that this story is the least memorable. I felt that the story was not that interesting, nor was it very creepy. Stephen King has the power to terrify through his writing (I read The Long Walk when I was in highschool. Ten years later I'm still having nightmares about it) but Mile 81 left me with no lasting impression.
0142419400|5.0|Cute, charming and love-able! I can't think of better way to describe this book. Yet it's also probably one of the worst words I could use in a review. It gives you the completely wrong idea about the story. While it was filled with adorable moments that make you smile and laugh it also was filled with plot and real problems. That's why I think Anna and the French Kiss so well liked. It was cute but realistic.    Anna And The French Kiss was about Anna being sent to a boarding school in Paris for her senior year by her father. Exciting right? Not for Anna, she would rather finish her last year at high school with her all her friends, and the crush who kissed her before she left. Anna doesn't really start enjoying the wonders of Paris until Étienne St. Claire starts showing her around. She and St. Claire quickly becoming very close friends. Of course, Anna knows he's insanely hot, with a swoon worthy accent but she also knows he has a girlfriend. Plus she has her crush back home in Atlanta, which complicates things.    Humor! There's so much of it through out the whole novel. I loved reading in Anna's point of view she has this sarcastic and hilarious attitude that always kept me laughing. Then there's St. Claire who seems so perfect yet has many flaws. It made him so realistic, I mean he was shorter then Anna! You don't see this to often in YA fiction. The guy is usually a `perfect' bad boy.     The plot of Anna and the French Kiss was completely it's own. It wasn't just one of those novels completely about romance. These characters were thrown into so many different complications. It seemed almost impossible for them to be happy. Once they get into a grove that seemed to work something would throw them off. This book touched so many different topics. I don't want to give too much away. You should just know it's not another romance novel. Stephanie Perkins is an author you're going to want to watch.     If you don't believe me about the epic-ness of Anna and the French Kiss well take a look at some of these reviews. This should help convince you.    \\"Very sly. Very funny. Very romantic. You should date this book.\\"  -- Maureen Johnson  This is a quote that can be found on the hard cover copy. I wish I could date this book Hint-Hint St. Claire.     \\"Imagine a mug of rich, thick hot chocolate. Now add a swirl of sweet whipped cream. Yummy? Oui. Well, Anna and the French Kiss is richer, sweeter, and--yes--even hotter. You're in for a very special treat.\\"   -- LAUREN MYRACLE  Another quote from the hard copy but they are just so true that I have to share them.

B005G26NJE|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />The Crossroads Guitar Festival is the brainchild of Eric Clapton to showcase the talents of his peers. Rarely do up and coming artists get a spot on the roster, but E.C. made an exception in 2010 when he asked Gary Clark Jr. to play. That speaks volumes.<br />Gary has been compared to Hendrix and Stevie Ray and I'm comfortable with that. He grew up listening to a gumbo of John Lee Hooker, Curtis Mayfield and Snoop Dog. The results are electrifying blues, tinged with rock and wrapped in a soulful groove.<br />The 27-year-old native of Austin, Texas is the first prodigy I've heard worth mentioning since Kenny Wayne Sheperd.<br />Warner has thankfully released a four-song EP to give us a taste, with a full-CD expected in early 2012.<br />Gary plays the field, from the electric blues explosion of \\"Bright Lights\\" to an updated acoustic blues masterpiece \\"When My Train Pulls In\\" in the vein of classic Robert Johnson.<br />He's been playing guitar since age seven and was mentored by some world class players including Jimmie Vaughan. He has won the Austin Music Award for Best Blues and Electric Guitarist on three separate occasions.<br />This is the artist to watch for 2012.
0062060554|1.0|Disappointed!  This book was advertised as a real \\"page turner\\". A great summer read! Well it wasn't. This story should have only taken 5o pages or less. It moved ahead so slowly. So drawn out.  Painful.  Only in the last chapters did it come alive.  The story ends abruptly after a tedious build up. Then it wraps up in a nice, neat improbable package.     I won't be passing this book on to my friends.

This movie is really great and will be just the thing for those who are into film noir b/w classic type movies like notorious, casablanca etc. Great plot and wonderfully executed performances by the entire cast - but have to say that she outshines everyone and is just breathtakingly beautiful - her character is portrayed to perfection - the pain she feels is so rivetingly reflected in her eyes each time the camera turns to her face and her outward playful expression transforms into a melancholy longing for love betrayed by her eyes... exquisite ...
0062073559|5.0|First let us talk about the author, Agatha Christie. She is the most widely published author of all time, outsold only by Shakespeare and the Bible! If I did not enjoy this book, I would be a minority to say the least. She first started writing detective fiction while working as a nurse during World War I. Her first book was The Mysterious Affair at Styles, which introduced her most legendary character, the detective Hercule Poirot. She also created plays, her most famous being Mousetrap. She achieved, what was most probably her highest honor, the title of Dame of the British Empire in 1971. She died 5 years later at the age of eighty-five.  When I first began the book, I thought I was in for a long nightmare of proper English and big words. But don't let this stop you! After the first chapter it seems as if you entered a different world and the language grows on you. It begins with Hercule Poirot going on a vacation to Egypt. He meets many interesting characters on his boat trip along the Nile. Christie is a genius at creating characters so vividly. A string of murders though ends the peaceful part of Poirot's trip. Poirot, with the help of some friends, tries to uncover the truth. And just when you think its over, another development pops up.   Many complained about the typos on the kindle version. I did not have a problem with this, only noticed a couple (so maybe its a problem with my English haha).  Anyway, great book, would recommend it to anyone!
1439102813|5.0|Every once in a while I read a book that I love so much I want to buy it for everyone I know.  Does that happen to you?  Well, that's how I felt when I finished reading \\"Still Alice.\\"  I just loved it!  And that, frankly, surprised me.  A book about Alzheimer's disease is one that I would expect to learn from but certainly not enjoy.  Turns out, this book is unforgettable.<br /><br />\\"Still Alice\\" is a novel about a 50-year old woman who is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease.  Alice experiences what most of us do as we get older -- we start to forget things.  Alice begins to wonder:  Is it just aging?  Stress?  Not enough sleep?  Menopause?  When Alice gets lost during a routine jog in her neighborhood, she recognizes there is something more going on and decides to see her doctor.  Alzheimer's was clearly not her first guess.<br /><br />I became fast friends with Alice.  She took me by the hand and lead me down the dark and winding path into dementia.  It's a fascinating journey, and I found myself standing right alongside Alice, taking each and every neurological test, wishing I could do something to help her as her daily life became such a struggle.  Yes, I'm 50 and my forgetfulness can be unnerving at times -- being able to tap into that emotion made Alice's descent even more terrifying.  But the dividing line between common forgetfulness and Alzheimer's disease became abundantly clear to me as I watched Alice sink deeper into the disease.  Spending time with Alice was both upsetting and mesmerizing.  Each day the challenges became greater -- from getting lost in her own home to not recognizing her own children.  I was truly pained for my friend Alice.<br /><br />Lisa Genova, the author of \\"Still Alice\\", has a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Harvard.  Her decision to make her fictional Alice a Harvard professor of psychology and linguistics might tempt readers to think this is autobiographical.  But Genova was apparently motivated to write this book because her grandmother suffered from Alzheimer's, and Lisa simply utilized her writing talent, making the story more accessible by using familiar settings and themes.  Usually books about Alzheimer's are written in either a clinical way or from the point of view of the caregiver, but I think Lisa's decision to make this story a work of fiction was inspired and succeeds brilliantly.  She lets us feel what it's like to have the disease, and we learn, right along with Alice, her husband and three grown kids, what Alzheimer's is all about, how deeply it changes not just the sufferer but the entire world to which she's connected.<br /><br />\\"Still Alice\\" is about more than the destruction of a mind.  It's a lesson in how to live life fully.  Alice taught me about bravery.  She taught me how to be a better friend.  As her yesterdays slipped away from her and her tomorrows became more uncertain, Alice taught me to never forget that life is here right now in this moment.ed from Alzheimer's, and Lisa simply utilized her writing talent, making the story more accessible by using familiar settings and themes.

B005974CNA|3.0|Maybe DT should follow Rudesses lead and do Genesis and Yes covers only. He does a mean Genesis !!!  MIKE PORTNOY GONE ??  DT continues without him ??? HMMMMMMMMMM....This is a rough hurdle to jump. Never thought I would contemplate the greatness of a CD with Mangini drumming! But!!! Although his parts are tremendous and his skills are on display, he simply does not pack the punch that MP did. His phrasing is a bit less complicated than our expected MP arrangements . He is well into the background of the mix. I don't hear his input on the songs which leaves you hanging a bit.   Any DT CD will be part of my collection and listening itinerary now and in the future.  But I must say for now,DT without Portnoy is like A Big Mac without the fries!!   DVD - The best drummers in the world auditioned to replace Portnoy. The accompanying DVD shares this process with us and is fascinating. Untill now, DT has thrived on Dynamics and brute force percussion. If you have ever been to a DT concert, Portnoy is a fire breathing , in your face, dragon. You leave the concert having been bombarded by Portnoys bollistic assault. The only drummer , that auditioned, who could fill these type of shoes is ? Nobody !! However,  Lang ,Donati,or Minnemann would have fueled new fire and direction to this phenomenal band. I would have chosen Donati!!! Lang is a little too hung up on technical performance and less so groove!! Minnemann the most technically amazing, is simply too goofy and also more of a jazz drummer. Of the ones that did not audition, I would have liked to see Jan Maillard give it a go  CD - Tough to grade this but three stars out of Five ! Why ? Boooooorrrriiiinnnggg !! Pretty forgettable! Tracks 3,5 and portions of 6 and 8 are very goodtechnically but DT does not offer up really anything new in the harmonies/hooks department. Additionally, Mangini sounds like a frikken drum machine more so than ever- Weak in the dynamics category.    Track 5 - haunting and cool chorus Gives wayto satisfying musical arrangements and typical DT esque experiance..More please...   Track 3 -Also like Track 3 technically speaking! Nice piano intro (similar to Muse resistance feel)and Offers up complicated arrangements that you are more than likely hoping for when you buy this CD. If you like this, try Tim Donahues'Madmen and Sinners.  Track 6 -  offers up about 2 minutes of some very awesome ear candy but you have to wait a whopping 4 minutes and 45 seconds to get to it.  Track 8 - Starts off with an OSI feel and goes to very familiar territory.  Heard it a hundred times if I've heard it once but still very good.  I regret that DT moved on without Mike P (despite his recent rebellion).  DT has made a bit of a statement that perhaps Mike P was wearing thin on them. So in summary here is my unfortunate final impression : Good CD - lots of ear candy for the musician but really have heard most of this befor. I always judged a new CD by how badly I wanted to get to see the concert.I could not hardly wait to see DT concerts in the past. Not sure that I need to see this one.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|A decent and interesting film, but without the last bite that would have gripped me.<br />The film focuses on the one female `conspirator' hanged after the Lincoln assassination, and on her reluctant defense lawyer. Its subject is the fight for rule of law and the abandonment of rule of law by those in power, who claim higher motives and reasons. The parallel to Guantanamo, water boarding, rendition, etc., is obvious and obviously intended. After all, Robert Redford directs. Equally obviously, many of the negative reviews come from the corner of those who consider rule of law a `liberal' idea.<br /><br />I am not knowledgeable about the specific case of Mary Surratt and her lawyer Aiken, the later founder of the Washington Post. Assuming the story gives an accurate picture, then this was a clear case of judicial murder and of abuse of power. Fair trial was denied. Proof of guilt was non existant, or rather: obviously fabricated and questionable.<br /><br />The hero of the story, McAvoy as lawyer, is a Union army hero turned to the legal profession. His mentor and chief, a Maryland senator, has forced him to accept the Surratt defense against strong resistance. In the course of the trial, he begins to see the injustice that is committed by the military court and he fights in earnest, which leads to bad social consequences for him.<br />One of the weaknesses of the film, for me, was the abruptness of the lawyer's transition from resistance to acceptance and passion. Now he refuses, next he fights. Not a case of good `character development'.<br />One of the strengths of the film is that the character of Mary Surratt is painted as an ambiguous one. She is not very cooperative with her own defense and we need to make up our minds if the fact that she is not entirely sympathetic would be a reason to find her guilty.<br />It is not so much a case of crying- out- loud injustice against an innocent lamb, as the lack of due process against somebody who might actually be guilty. The lesson might have been even stronger if she were even more unlikable.<br /><br />The biggest surprise in the film came when I realized during the credits, that the role of Secretary Stanton, the chief bad man with good motives, had been played by Kevin Kline. Well disguised, Mr.Kline!ven stronger if she were even more unlikable.

I found the music to be remarkable in its depth and feeling. I'm so sorry she's no longer with us. I'd highly recommend this cd to people who like really good blues and jazz.
B004BSFSTA|4.0|These headphones sound great whether it's bass you want to clear higher sounds... They work well on airplanes and in library environments (blocks computer hum great!), but don't seem to block enough sound in louder environments such as riding in a vehicle with the radio on and people talking. One of my favorite things about them is that they fold up easily so I can put them in a drawstring pouch (which it doesn't come with) and carefully put them in my backpack. The coiled cord is nice because it is pretty long but doesn't get in the way.

079073639X|4.0|An all-star cast is tasked with investigating what appears to be an alien space craft on the ocean's bottom. This is not your ordinary man meets alien type of movie. In fact the \\"alien\\" is never really well established. The movie, while it has a sci-fi background is more of a psychological mystery. If your science fiction expectation for aliens and gadgets are not too high, this is an enjoyable film, a more cerebral science fiction.<br /><br />There are no creepy aliens, no f-bombs, no sex, no nudity.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas didn't direct the better episodes.  Wonder how the directors feel about all the awful changes.  I know his divorce totaled his assets, but does he really need to keep squeezing out pointless or damaging incremental changes in order to get people to buy yet another copy of a 30 year old film?
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Great record, really focussed writing and killer riffs. Joey sounds great; I loved Anthrax back in the day but felt some of the stuff on ATL and POT was a little forced- but not here. Joey's vocal melodies are excellent, the production just smokes, and the band is a freakin' machine. I was hesitant about buying WM as I have been iffy on a lot of Anthrax's later output, but I think is their best overall record next to Spreading The Disease. Support the boys and buy this now!

0671721720|3.0|Though she's a woman and not a diplomat, Honor Harrington, the highly competent and well-respected Manticoran Navy Captain, has been assigned a diplomatic mission to a planet run by a patriarchal religious cult. Why would the Manticorans send an aggressive woman with no diplomatic skills on this type of mission? There's only one possible reason: to try to make The Honor of the Queen more interesting...<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with On Basilisk Station, the first book in the Honor Harrington series, because there was too much exposition about military tactics and spaceship dynamics and Honor was too perfect and seemed cold and distant. I decided to read The Honor of the Queen because I already had purchased it in audio and I was hoping Honor would be more relatable as we got to know her better. Actually, she does seem more human, going on an almost murderous rampage at one point and becoming teary-eyed at another. Weber begins to make it clear that Honor has emotions, but we rarely see them and she's such a Mary Sue that it's difficult to feel comfortable with her. Even her homicidal rampage was more righteous than reckless.<br /><br />But my biggest issue with the Honor Harrington series is that the plots so far (I've read only the first two books), though exciting at times (e.g., the big space battles at the ends) are constantly being interrupted by dull exposition about base and closing velocities, acceleration rates, missile weights, engagement times, energy ranges, magazine sizes, projected courses, etc.<br /><br />This material does not have to be dull. As I read, I kept comparing it to Patrick O'Brien's Aubrey/Maturin (Master and Commander) novels which have analogous plots (just at sea instead of in space). Those books contain a lot of information about warships and naval tactics, but they are immensely entertaining because the protagonists are real people with interests, hobbies, relationships, problems and faults.<br /><br />To be fair to David Weber, it is certainly possible that my disappointment is partially caused by Allyson Johnson's narration of the audiobooks. Her voices are pleasant, but she uses little inflection. I downloaded a free print copy of The Honor of the Queen at the Baen Free Library and read several pages that I thought were dull in the audio version. They were better in my head than they were on audio, but I still found myself skimming over some of the exposition (which is difficult to do with an audiobook). I'm not sure that any narrator is skilled enough to make The Honor of the Queen exciting for me or to get me past the glaring problem with the premise of Honor being sent as a diplomat to a misogynist society.<br /><br />I think I'm finished with Honor Harrington, which is too bad because I spent one of my Audible credits on the third book.disappointment is partially caused by Allyson Johnson's narration of the audiobooks.

1589949811|4.0|LOTR lcg is most suitable to deck builders who like to have a sosial game.  The game gets better with those upgrade adventure packs!  The basic box is guite limited, but basic box + 3 different adventure packs provide good card pool. So good that it may be difficult to chose what cards to drop out from the deck.  Those who are good in deck building tend to think that the game is too easy, and those that use pre constructed decks seems to have more difficulties. For that reason it is good that there are so many fan-made scenarios for LOTR lcg, so it is possible to find suitable adventures to different kind of players.

However, when I pay extra for a hard bound book, since it was not available in paperback, even months after release, I expect that the workmanship of the book be good.  The binding of the book is second rate, putting it mildly.  Shame on the publisher for being so cheap, and being so selfish about not releasing the book in paperback sooner!

0823015033|5.0|I ordered this book two days ago and just now received it.  I am working in air-dry clay and purchased the book for its tutorials on building \\"realistic\\" human figures.  This book excellently provides that.

B003IPC5SO|5.0|This is one of the best Kylie Minogue albums I have heard in awhile since \\"Fever\\". I didn't really like \\"Body Language\\" or \\"X\\" that was previously released before this album but when I heard the MP3 clips, it sounded like Kylie got her true mojo back. After looking in every store that sold music in town, I finally bought this album at Barnes & Nobles for a pricy $18 and it is well worth the money. It has the elements that \\"Fever\\" had but her sound is incredibly fresh and enticing in every track. She amazes you with her signature catchy beats and rhythms and the lyrics absolutely tingle your senses. This is definitely an album you want to have in your collection.
075640407X|5.0|There's no other way for me to put it. This novel is quite simply the best one I've ever read. The Name of the Wind is beautiful, brilliant, and just this... whole new magical world. You'll absolutely fall in love with it. The writing style is the best I've come across. The writer is able to communicate Kvothe's thoughts and feelings without explicitly stating them.      And Kvothe... He's wonderful, hard not to love. He's realistic. He's witty and funny. It's not just him, though, as every character in the book (besides the bad guys) are likable. I find longer books daunting usually. I read a lot, but when it hits near 1000 pages I think it must be a snore.      The Name of the Wind is pretty big, but it's so good and so completely amazing that it overshadowed all the other books I've ever read by a far margin. Anyone who reads this review... just read it. Seriously.

B003L77GGK|1.0|I've loved this show for so long but they changed showrunners and it shows. Full of plot holes, inconsistencies, the heroes acting out of character so many times... just terrible. The complete destruction of fan favorite Castiel just to keep it \\"all about two brothers\\", which has gotten so redundant by this point. It makes me sad because I've always loved this show but I guess it's time to let go. I'll just be over here pretending it ended in season 5.
0307279189|5.0|Even if you don't love running, I bet you'll enjoy this book - I did.  The information and hypotheses were interesting, the stories were inspiring, and the content was engaging.  Before I read this book, I had been a weight-maintenance runner for 6 years.  I disliked running only marginally less than the stationary bike or elliptical, but did it to stay trim and healthy.  After I read this book, I was inspired by the stories of people who run for the joy of it over phenomenal distances to foray into distance running myself.  I went in full-steam and trained for a marathon, and it's the accomplishment I'm most proud of to this day.  I'm now officially a running addict; I will never be fast in any way, but this book made me want to find out what makes people enjoy running for hours.... and I did.  Maybe you will too.

B00004RFFS|2.0|I recently read Anne Rice's famous book, and enjoyed it immensely; then I rented this movie version, and enjoyed it ... not so much.    The trouble is that \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is a very cerebral book that deals with tough topics like existential dread, our right (or lack thereof) to kill, the nature of \\"good\\" and \\"evil,\\" and the existence (or lack thereof) of God. Unfortunately, mainstream Hollywood has never been very good at addressing such tough topics, particularly not in blockbuster movies like this one. Mainstream Hollywood also isn't that good at doing sex scenes, which is another big problem when you're adapting a sexy book.    With most of the novel's philosophy hacked out, and the sensuality toned down, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" ends up being a movie with not much to say, and not much reason to exist. Sure, the movie makes a few short forays into philosophical territory, but I think it's fair to say that 90-95% of the book's thoughtful content is absent. Also missing are a couple of my favorite sequences from the book - namely, Louis' attempt to confess to a priest, and the creepy Eastern Europe segment with the revenant.    But even if I hadn't read the (far) superior book, I still think I would've disliked this movie. At least half of the cast is all wrong, for example. Brad Pitt gives an awful, lethargic performance as Louis (no, introspective characters don't have to be so dull), and Antonio Banderas is positively cheesy as Armand. Fortunately, Kirsten Dunst and the not-at-all-miscast Tom Cruise lend considerable energy to the film, capturing the essence of their characters far more successfully than Pitt.    On the plus side, the film is very lavish, with beautiful sets and costumes and a suitably eerie music score. The makeup is also awesome, and there is a refreshing lack of stupid digital effects (which, of course, have completely taken over all contemporary \\"event\\" movies). With all the impressive attention to detail on display, I'm surprised that the filmmakers got so much of the substance wrong.    Honestly, I'm also surprised to see so many positive reviews of this film, particularly coming from fans of Rice. If you think that \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is only about *depressed vampires*, then this is the movie adaptation for you. But, as I said above, I think the novel is really about the search for morality and meaning in human life ... the bored vampires are just window-dressing for Rice's exploration of big philosophical issues. In the absence of those issues, all this movie can provide is shot after shot of vampires in frilly shirts biting ladies' wrists...
B001AW156U|4.0|It worth every penny. The only thing that made me a little bit uncomfortable is the sharp corners at the bottom. It depends on how you hold your controller and how big your hand is. Before I started using the trigger, the way I held my controller is that my left index finger is very close to L2 button, but not close enough to touch it. After installed the trigger, I always found my index finger scratch the sharp corners of the trigger, which hurts a lot if you are in an intense fight and you have to use L2 repeatedly. I solved my problem by getting used to hold my controller a little bit in its back so it leaves room between my index finger and the trigger. But I think they should improve this by making the corners at the bottom round, similar to those of L2 buttons made by Sony, so that it won't hurt even if your fingers are touching it. But overall, I'm very satisfied.
0061122416|1.0|I do not reccommend this book. Its not inspiring or life changing. The story is awful and the metaphors are repeated over and over, so much that they become meaningless. I couldn't finish this book, it really lost me when \\"the boy\\" started talking to the wind and the sun. Soul of the world, omens and destiny...please make it stop. The story is boring and tiresome. It felt like a terrible childrens book combined with the bible. I just threw up.
B000ZMVAXO|4.0|Kind of gets in the way when plugged in - need to get used to that.    Sound is good but if you want a clean sound after too much metal forget it - how much would that cost in terms of another circuit to add? 50 cents in China (oh sorry, it says made in Japan)    Oh and why include a pair of cheap junk batteries and say not to use them except to test the amp and then go buy some alkalines - why not just include a couple of Duracell instead?
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I just finished this book, about 20 minutes ago. I do not normally review books on here, but I had this overwhelming feeling that The Night Circus deserves one. And this will contain no spoilers. I don't think that's fair to readers.    Reasons I loved this book:  1) The prose was beautifully written, and was not over powering to the point where you're skimming the paragraphs looking for points that actually matter to the storyline.   2)The descriptions of EVERYTHING, could activate all of your senses in your own personal reading spot. I was actually imagining the taste of circus food in my mouth, just by reading the words. And when I went grocery shopping today I saw a caramel apple and decided it was a must-have in order to finish the last quarter of the book.  3)There is a \\"love story\\" here. But there are no detailed sex scenes. It's completely left to the readers interpretation and imagination.  4) The rest of my \\"likes\\" will spoil your experience.    Reasons I did not like the book (even though I am giving it a 5 star):  1)I couldn't put it down without thinking about the darn circus. I was dreaming about it at night, and thinking about it when I was away from my Kindle, unable to read.   2)There isn't really an ending. While I'm thankful for the last 40 pages or so...I want to know more about the characters. I'm unsure if it was purposely left that way for perhaps another book or if it was just left that way for the magical experience.   3)I wanted a villain for some reason. I wanted someone to be evil. I wanted someone to interfere in ways that would make the performer's performances more challenging. When I read about Magic, there is always someone dark. I didn't find that here. I guess I was hoping for stereotypical dark magic, evil sorcerer.     I would recommend this book to anyone I know.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I loved it. Sorry for the vague review. But, just give it a shot. I think you will at least like(not love)it.
1601252463|5.0|First off just let me say the artwork in these Pathfinder books is truly awesome and this is no exception.    This advanced player's guide really lets you into your character and there is so much customization. I'm used to playing DnD 3.5 so this is truly a really great experience migrating over to Pathfinder.    Simply put I really love this book. The new classes in here are some you can have fun with and there are some solid additional feats and abilities for your character.    If you are going to play Pathfinder this is a solid addition and you should most definitely buy it.
B004ZG5F28|5.0|This is a great and quirky romantic comedy.  I love the 2nd one too (anyone know when the US bluray version of Edge of Reason is going to come out?).  Picture quality is great and it is very wide screen.  I generally only buy bluray when it is on sale or $10 or less but this movie was an exception.
B000PTYNI6|5.0|If you are buying this you have good taste.    It was great on the CD I had and it's great on the vinyl too. If you are a Cure fan this is a must have. Each track is awesome and really shows off what made the early Cure so great.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|You'll need a hefty supply of tissues while reading this. It's definitely a cover to cover book. I read it in a few short hours and reflected for days. A lot of the content is quite uncomfortable but it's worth it to gain such insight on the human condition.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|This movie by Quentin Tarantino was very well done. It takes place in France during WWII. The story is about a fictitious group of American Soldiers whose mission is to infiltrate German lines in France.<br /><br />For the average movie viewer this movie seemed boring because of all the subtitles. A majority of the movie was in French and German. Also there was not a lot of action or violence which made the movie slow for those wanting to see the usual Tarantino action. I really enjoyed the way the story moves along. He uses a sentimental story of a dairy farmer trying to hide Jews from the \\"Jew Hunter.\\" This was a great scene that sets up how much the French hated the Germans and despised their culture. The story ends very epically with the stories of a hiding Jew who owns a theatre in France, the Jew Hunter, and the Inglorious Bastards.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie for younger teens because of the language, a single, brief sex scene, and there was a few very disturbing violent scenes. Its not one of my favorite movies but I did enjoy and would buy it.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|First I'll start with the positive aspects of this book. The mood is spectacular.     Now for the negatives:    1. Characters exist for the sole purpose of moving the plot forward. When big surprise #1 came around, I did not care because the character did not make an impact. When surprise #2 came around, despite knowing this character better, I did not care much about his fate. While the style of keeping all the characters vague works to keep them mysterious, it also makes them cold. None of the characters felt as though they had \\"souls\\" behind the words. I did not care about any of their fates. In fact, by the end I hoped for something, anything, interesting to happen. If she kept with the Romeo and Juliet allusion at least the ending would have been somewhat interesting instead of hamfisting a happily ever after ending.     2. There is little to no character development in the book. For all the apt descriptions for the circus itself, there is much to be told of the characters. Much time passes in the book and despite years of friendships (or love) it feels distant and cold. The brevity works against characterization. I'm not attached to anyone because I don't know enough about anyone to be attached.     3. The romance is rushed. I am not a fan of the \\"fireworks\\" trope that is prevalent in the latter half of this book. The duo tells me they're in love, but I've had little evidence that proves their love. Overall, their relationship reminds me of the novel [[ASIN:B003FHPZCI Like Water For Chocolate (Mass Market Paperback)]] without the finesse and intensity. (I would recommend reading that book instead of this one. It has the amazing mood, imagery, and slow burning intense romance without the problems of this novel.)    4. The tarot cards were  not researched. I'm glad she didn't bring the death card into the picture because otherwise I would've chucked my kindle out the window in rage. It is upsetting the author did not do any research because I found every scene with the cards to induce much eye rolling in their cheesiness. Also, this leads to a problem elabortated below.     5. She relied upon the seer characters in the latter half to the point of infuriation. The characters were used as a crutch in a storyline that did not need them. Any sort of seer character is apt to ruin the suspense, and the fact that two existed (and to a lesser extent, 3) ruined the tension building up over several hundred pages. There were too many magical characters in the latter half pulling the strings.     6. Stereotypes. The most bothersome to me was Tsukiko. I wanted to scream everytime Tsukiko entered the picture. She is by far the stereotypical portrayal of a mysterious asian women we grew up in with media. Petite, black hair, knows things we don't, unique asian features, ect ect. The exotic for the sake of being exotic but providing nothing of depth beyond \\"wooo she's exotic\\". Nothing in her actions reflects anything of Japanese culture.    It is unfortunate because the author had much to work with and so much more could have been done with the characters. Instead of the boring and useless interludes about the rides, she should have used the pages to fill us in on the characters that inhabit that world. Perhaps then I would have cared about their fates and ultimately the novel.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|One of the things that I was most looking forward to attending at BlogHer was a special advance screening of the Disney movie \\"The Help\\".  Disney extended an invitation to all the BlogHer attendees to a screening at the historic Reading Gaslamp Theater on 5th Avenue in San Diego. The theater was packed with conference goers and Disney even treated us all to FREE popcorn and soft drinks.<br /><br />In \\"The Help,\\" Emma Stone plays Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan, a young woman who is just returning to 1960's Jackson, Mississippi after completing four years of college. In her absence, all her childhood friends have married, had kids and are now living a modern day version of their parents lives, including having underpaid African American maids come in to their houses to cook, clean and raise their kids. Skeeter wants more than to just play bridge with her friends and climb the social ladder. She wants to be writer. So she gets a job at the local paper writing about the only thing that a woman in the 1960's South is allowed to write about: household cleaning.<br /><br />Skeeter's best friend Hilly Holbrook (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) has became the controlling town socialite who keeps all the young wives in line by intimidating them if they fail to follow her lead. After Skeeter learns that her family's maid was fired by her mother after over 20 years of faithful service, she decides to write a book based on the point of view of the black maids in Jackson who daily leave their own homes and children to go and cook, clean and the raise kids in other homes where they are not even allowed to use the bathroom.<br /><br />Skeeter's plans are complicated by the fact what she plans to do is considered illegal under Mississippi law and because Hilly is the town bigot who is pressuring everyone to build separate bathroom facilities for the maids because she believes that blacks and whites cannot even share the same bathrooms in the privacy of their own homes.<br /><br />Skeeter is friends with Elizabeth Leefolt (played by Ahna O'Reilly) and Skeeter talks Elizabeth's maid, Aibileen Clark into telling her story for the book.  Viola Davis gives the most wonderful performance of the movie as Aibileen, a maid who has lost her own son due to bigotry and is currently struggling with turning a blind eye to how Elizabeth treats her 3 year old daughter who Elizabeth considers to be ugly and therefore does not deserve any of her time or effort.<br /><br />The movie follows how Skeeter finds out what the maids are really thinking and how woman, no matter the color of skin or the amount of money, are struggling with finding their way in a male dominated southern society.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, complex movie that shines a light on the difficult way of life for most blacks in the 1960's south.  It is obvious in the movie that most people in town are not bigots like Hilly, but they are so afraid of losing their place in society, that they go along with keeping the status quo and treating their help just a little better than slaves.  The movie also shows the struggle of women in the 1960's who want to be more than housewives and mothers.<br /><br />I predict were will be lots of Oscar nominations for this film.  Actress great Cicely Tyson had a small, but moving part in this film that had everyone crying in the audience as the Phelan maid who is fired after 20 years of service just to save face at a society dinner party.<br /><br />Actress Sissy Spacek was laugh-out-loud funny as Hilly's aging mother who is suffering from early Alzheimer's.  I think that actress Allison Janney who played Skeeter's mother will get an Oscar for her performance as a woman dieing of cancer and struggling with doing what she knows is right, even if it means losing all her society friends.  And also actress Octavia Spencer, was wonderful as Minny Jackson, the maid that first worked for the biggest bigot in town and then for the socialite from the wrong side of the trackswhile also struggling with domestic violence in her own home.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie that everyone will enjoy. It is rated PG-13 due to implied off screen violence, language and adult themes.own home.      This is a wonderful movie that everyone will enjoy.

0307887898|5.0|Stunning.    In short, I've developed software and led product development teams in a variety of startups for 20+ years and I've worked with bright, committed people. In all this time, there was a clear boundary: we built the product (or service), and someone else told us what to build.  To a great degree, it was a black box how the \\"what & why\\" was determined.  While we build lots of great stuff - too many times, it wasn't what the real, paying customers wanted.  Additionally, an unfortunate, side-effect was that the development team rarely had that emotional connection & investment with solving real problems for real people. Instead, the team was more focused on making product management happy instead of the customer.    Fast-forward having applied lean startup to two different startups, and the results are profoundly different.  There's never a question (for all of us) why we are building what we are building, how it's related to solving a real problem for real people & who will pay for the problem to be solved.  There's never a guarantee there's a sustainable business, but the clarity of what needs to be done, who it's for and why we are doing is inspiring.    I've suggested this book, this approach and related materials to lots of folks - and it's a pleasure to see how many people intuitively get it so quickly!     Having said that, this isn't always easy: old ways die hard, shiny objects are interesting, ego, desire & bias get in the way of interpreting the results, etc.  However, I can't imagine going back.
B005974CNA|5.0|Will keep this short -     This is a pure progressive rock album. Expansive, ambient, atmospheric, unique. It's something I've missed since \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence / Scenes From a Memory. Cool sounds and textures, a mix of east and west styles, and for all the talk of technicalities in prog music - in this album it just fits. No noodling for the sake of chops show and tell - it's part of the song progression. In all honesty I think \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\" and \\"Bridges In the Sky\\" (especially the chorus' to both) are two of the best songs Dream Theater has ever written.    First five I've given in a long time, so happy I can say DT is my favorite band again.
B005COO1X6|3.0|As somebody who got hooked on King over 20 years ago, I was severely disappointed in this one. His character development of Pete was charming and well done while the rest of the story just quite didn't hit the mark. And the ending? That was just lazy.    The ONLY reason this got the 3rd star is that I liked Pete a whole lot.

B004L03B3S|5.0|When I first saw a clip of this movie, I must admit, I was attracted to the beautiful bodies and handsome faces.  I was also drawn in by the sexual energy.  However, watching the movie in its entirety, I found \\"From Beginning to End\\" to be so much more.    There is a loving, extended family that share dinners and laughs. There is the main relationship between the two brothers. It is very clear from the beginning that theirs is a bond that can not be broken. The moments when they are in bed for the first time, confessing why they love each other is one of the most beautiful, romantic scenes in any movie I've ever seen.      It is so interesting to see how they cope with having to be apart for the first time in their lives.      After a while, I forgot they were brothers.  It isnt really a factor in the movie after they become adults.       I didn't particularly care for the subtitles, but this movie won't disappoint.    [[ASIN:B004L03B3S From Beginning to End]]
B004GFGUAY|4.0|I'm really enjoying this record. As a fan of Spaghetti Westerns, Danger Mouse, and Jack White, the combination works well for me. Really good orchestrations, cool instrumentals, and great songs. White and Jones have completely different styles of singing, but the contrast makes the record more interesting in my opinion. I definitely recommend this one.
B00139B39E|1.0|I am a long-time DT fan and a musician as well.  I listened to the remix of \\"Pull Me Under\\" and was immediately disappointed.  Yes, each individual instrument (including every close-mic'ed drum) sounds tighter and clearer, but once they took away the reverb and \\"room\\" sound, the overall track sounds lifeless.  The snare sounds tight and poppy, but it has no depth to it.  They also tried to expand the stereo separation and position the drums further apart, and they actually tried to move the position of the hi-hat (which usually sits in the center of a drum mix) off to the left as if you were sitting at the kit yourself.  The problem with this is that the original recording was done with the overheads and the actual hi-hat mic in certain positions, and the positions of these mics were carefully placed so there would not be phasing issues with the hi-hat panned close to center.  After panning the hi-hat to the left, they actually caused phasing issues!<br /><br />The other complaint with this remix is that they ran it through a limiter to boost the overall volume (thankfully not so badly that it hits the \\"brick wall\\"), but they totally lost the dynamics of the song!!  It starts out at the max volume of the song and never varies in volume from beginning to end.  I listened to the original version and then the remix twice, and analyzed the dynamics of the original.  The original starts out with the clean guitar and the tom rhythm and then layers on instruments until the full band comes in, and even then there is a dynamic build up to the point where the vocals come in.  There are points where dynamics are used to heighten the effects of the lyrics, and then there is the return to the original theme during the long guitar/keyboard solo and a build-up to the famous \\"32nd note fill\\" that basically put MP on the map, and then the punch of the final chorus.  In the remix, the punch of the final chorus is gone!  The 32nd note drum fill has absolutely no power or meaning behind it.<br /><br />Honestly, the remixes make them sound like a Dream Theater tribute band.Honestly, the remixes make them sound like a Dream Theater tribute band.
0385534639|5.0|After hearing about The Night Circus for the last few months I was wondering if it could live up to the hype surrounding it. I can unequivocally say \\"yes, it does.\\" Let me just state it up front: I love this book. There aren't many books that I will read again, but this is absolutely one of them. This is a book to be read and savored much like you'd savor and enjoy visiting Le Cirque des Rêves (The Circus of Dreams) in the novel. Erin Morgenstern has created a magical world of great depth with wonderful characters.    At the center of the story are Celia and Marco who are bound together in a magical competition and then so much more. I enjoyed both of these characters tremendously. All of the characters that inhabit or are connected to the Circus are also remarkable. There was not a one that did not intrigue or charm me in some way. At times I wanted to clap my hands so delighted I was by what was happening.    The book is mainly two intersecting stories connected to Le Cirque des Rêves that move toward each other throughout the book. It's easy to keep track of where and when you are because the information is provided at the beginning of each chapter. There is mystery, romance, intrigues, and amazing settings. In addition to the two narratives, there are little chapters interspersed directed at the reader to walk you through the Circus. These little chapters enable you to feel that you are there experiencing the Circus yourself. They are dreamy and evoke the Circus beautifully.     I was sad when I got to the end of the book because I wanted to linger a bit longer among the black and white tents of the mysterious and magnificent Le Cirque des Rêves. The Night Circus is a fantastical book with rich prose, superb characters, and a mesmerizing story.  Once touched by Le Cirque des Rêves you will never forget it.    I give The Night Circus 5 Qwills.     Originally posted at The Qwillery
B003ZSJ212|5.0|doesn't mean it's right to give it a bad review.  There are some people who genuinely hate the revisions but I think most people don't really care that much.  Most of the haters end up watching it and buying it anyway.  These are spectacular stories with or without the revisions.  In blu-ray quality they are a superb watch.  I think everyone should watch these films and not worry about whether or not it's popular to hate the revisions.
0062060554|5.0|I found this book while I was surfing through the Amazon website.  I am so glad I ordered it.  I could hardly wait to read from page to page, staying up late into the night until I finished it.  My heart was racing by the end.  Amazing thriller.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I grew up in the 80's and was mocked and picked on in elementary and middle school because I wasn't into Star Wars at the time.  After discovering it pretty much for the first time in the 90's, I fell in love.  If I remember correctly it was the THX certified re-releases circa late 90s that was the first set I watched start to finish, shortly before the new prequel series came out.  I finally understood exactly what I had missed and why these movies were such a big deal.  Since then, I have seen the prequel trilogy and just about every release up to this point.  I have been anxiously awaiting the day it might arrive on Blu Ray so I can soak up the 5.1 or 7.1 sound and see a brilliantly revived THX certified picture in all its digitized glory.<br /><br />I've built myself up for what I would consider a reasonable restoration of these films.  Sure, they'll get rid of the graininess, maybe do some basic color correction and leave us with a finely-tuned and clarified set of films deserving of a stake in my Blu Ray collection.  Unfortunately, George Lucas seems much more interested in adding and changing things instead.  I have watched the countless clips of Vader screaming \\"Nooooooooo\\" and Ewoks blinking, Yoda being replaced by a CGI clone of himself and so on, only to find that its all an unnecessary layer (or several) that actually subtract from the original films, rather than add anything of substance.<br /><br />As an artist, photographer and creative consultant and enthusiast I must tell you that knowing when to be finished with something is just as important as knowing when to put your ideas to work and create something new.  I suggest George Lucas move on from the constant augmenting of these films.  I don't support the changes and will use my purchasing power to show it.  Sorry Georgie, i'll be waiting until you get the hint that this isn't what your fans want from these films.  Stick to restoration and nothing more, bring this out in its original but restored form and then we'll talk about me handing over some money.  Until then, I can't say i'll buy this or bother recommending it to anyone.  I will probably try to avoid watching it out of embarrassment for you.  Thanks!!en we'll talk about me handing over some money.  Until then, I can't say i'll buy this or bother recommending it to anyone.

B0050PYNP8|4.0|It's not quite Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, but this was really rather funny.  I enjoyed it, and it's nice to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up again!  They always put out some funny stuff together!  I hope they come out together in many more great comedic works in the years to come!  Seth Rogen is funny and was great as Paul, and Jason Bateman & Kristen Wiig are always funny.  I loved that Sigourney Weaver had a role to play as well, given her history of roles in alien movies.  :-) If you're into sci-fi/comedy, or you just like the good ol boys from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, you should definitely check this movie out.  Good times!
B001EN71DQ|4.0|What a great way to lead in to the main game of the real star wars. Story lines are a little thin but adequate for their purpose. Great watching for a fan.
B0059DOJAA|3.0|Over the last couple of years I've seen my interest in power metal simultaneously strengthen and bow and break. Without going into a band-by-band analysis, it's hard to explain why this band's work remains viable and another band's doesn't. There have been serious surprises and there has been more than enough writting on the wall. Still, the one thing I didn't see coming was my growing disinterest in Edguy. As with any lingering feeling, it didn't happen overnight and it didn't just happen with the last album (which would have been more than enough to justify it) but was growing even if I didn't want to admit it. So, if this paragraph is any indication, I've come to accept Edguy isn't the band I loved only a few years back. I've grown and they've grown (into what I haven't a clue) so the very least I can do is be honest about it.    The problem with Edguy is ironically alluded to with the title of this album, Age of the Joker. First let's start with the word \\"Joker.\\" Edguy has always been known for their wacky antics, and you don't have to look too far, especially on newer albums and singles, to see this in action. For years I found this quality endearing, but once tracks like \\"Lavatory Love Machine\\" (groan) started making their debut the hesitation to dive in head first with the insanity started to build. This feeling magically disappeared when Rocket Ride was the hot thing but it managed to boomerang back a few years after its release when I discovered that album wasn't all I thought it was. I knew I had grown tired of Edguy's humor the minute I heard \\"Sex Fire Religion\\" on Tinnitus Sanctus.    This brings us to \\"Age.\\" The sad fact is Edguy's humor doesn't age well. Can anyone really listen to \\"Save Us Now\\" on Mandrake and not get the immediate urge to change the track? Alien drum bunnies may have been funny in 2001 but all it is now is a less-than-impressive filler track on an overstated \\"breakthrough album.\\" Yet this is only one take on why the word \\"age\\" is soimportant when it comes to Edguy. Age has a lot to do with this new \\"rock\\" sound Edguy has cultivated since Tinnitus Sanctus. Now, I'm not going to say that power metal style the band adhered to before was the most fertile valley when it comes to music, but Edguy was good enough - and smart enough - to make it their own. This fails to be case with this new, aforementioned style that only serves to make the material sound dated before it is even released. In other words, Edguy's material sounds a lot older that it should, which is just ludicrous considering this is still a relatively young band. Age of the Joker is something I'd expect to come at the end of their career, not at what should be the apex. Still, looking at the pictures of the band in the booklet, I can't even be sure these are the same guys that drew my attention ten years ago.    That said, I am willing to extend a hand to Age of the Joker in the name of diplomacy. I can't say I'm in love with this album but it deserves some props for a variety of reasons. The most obvious is this is much better than the train wreck that was Tinnitus Sanctus. Second, this is a grower album. It's the kind of album you definitely need to listen to more than once for it to make its impact and reveal everything within. Do I think there is a preverbal goldmine in here? No. I don't think the album will ever prove it's worth more than the three out five I'm giving it, but it certainly isn't a cellar dweller either. The real hitch of such a situation is the album lacks a real hook; there is never a moment where I'm absolutely dying to hear a given song when I'm away from the album, something that wasn't a problem when a track like \\"King of Fools\\" made its debut.    Is Age of the Joker the beginning of reconciliation been a band and a listener or merely a small reprieve before the rift between the two becomes insurmountable? I wish I had the answer. Still, the album has been the first measurable glimmer of hope between the twofor a long time and as shaky as the truths is I'm willing to take the gamble. I've dismissed bands for less than that; let's hope Edguy makes the most of the opportunity.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This thing is massive. I have it oriented so that the air is blown upward and through the 200mm fan on the top of my computer case, and it is blocking one of the four RAM slots on my motherboard. I'm only using one slot at the moment, so it doesn't really affect me, but it's something to keep in mind. I also had to switch the cooling fan to the opposite side of the cooler because it was getting in the way of a side fan I was trying to install onto my case. The fan seems to be equally effective on either side, as far as I can tell.    That being said I'm very satisfied with this product. My CPU right now sits at a cool 35C, and even when I'm gaming it rarely goes above 50C, even when I'm over-clocking.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Seriously. I'm a bigger Star Wars fan than most of you. George Lucas ruined the movie you grew up with? Who cares what you grew up with! It's his vision and he can do whatever he wants with it! Haul out your VHS machines and watch those decrepit versions if you want. Me, I'm going to enjoy all the films with all the updates and IMPROVEMENTS including Episode I - III for what it is... part of the Star Wars universe. For your information, by the way, those VHS versions are not the same as the theatrical editions anyway so good luck finding the bootleg recordings from inside movie theater if you want to see what you saw as a kid. The more Lucas adds to the movies the better. More animated movies too? Bring it on. More Clone Wars, why not? The sense of entitlement you 1 star givers have is ludicrous. Grow up and quit whining. Better yet, keep whining... I'll just enjoy these movies, with all its changes, while you keep yearning for yesteryear.

The other reviewers provided me the needed technical information so I know I was getting the correct cable/connector. Researched heavily, looked at the big box stores, no joy. I was not in a hurry anyway so the standard shipping was fine. So far used it twice to stream camera video/audio into IMovie. No problems on my end.
0802473156|5.0|This is a great read for anyone who wants to have a solid and loving relationship with another person....so that is ALMOST EVERYONE! It has helped me understand how to show love to my husband, my children, my in-laws and parents, my friends, my neighbors, and more. It even helps me relate to my co-workers and people I serve with in church. The biggest thing that I keep coming back to in this book is that many people tend to show love to others the way that he/she best like to receive it. They need us to show them love the way THEY need to receive it most. This is a key lesson that has helped in every relationship I nurture and cherrish!
0061784788|4.0|This is one of my favorite series of Novels. Science & Science fiction merge for page-turning suspense, & I learn something fascinating in every single book. If you like the Davinci Code & the Steve Berry books, you'll love these. Start at the beginning, with 'Sandstorm'- and read them all. The only reason this particular book only got 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 like every other book in the series is I found the Mormon aspect, which I found unnecessary. If you're Mormon you'll probably love it even more. I do recommend Devil Colony without reservations, & particularly enjoyed the Native American aspects of this one. Read the series- you won't regret it! Can't wait for the next book!!
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is a book that is more imaginative than anything I've read in a long time. It is magical and whimsical as well as dark and disturbing. It is dreamlike and fantastic with haunted undertones. It is enchanting and charming and dangerous.<br /><br />The story is told in alternating points of view and times, in the third person present tense. The scattered scenes work together seamlessly to add both knowledge and mystery, without causing the sort of confusion that makes a story difficult to follow. The pacing is perfect. The setting is grandiose. The prose is lush, magical, and dreamlike. The imagery of the circus is delightful, engrossing, and easily imagined by the descriptions. The world building surrounding the circus is incredibly well done, hitting on all of the senses and doing an amazing job of creating atmosphere.<br /><br />While The Night Circus follows several characters who are involved with the circus, the story centers around Celia and Marco, two magicians pitted against each other in a mysterious duel. The cast of characters surrounding Le Cirque des Rêves is as unique as the circus itself. They range from architects and clock makers to dreamers and ballerinas to illusionists and contortionists. The circus is the catalyst for the relationships that develop between them. It connects them. And by the time that I was finished with the book, I had become connected to them as well.<br /><br />The Night Circus had me engrossed in the story and characters, and especially the setting. I read it slowly, not because I was disinterested, but because I did not want it to end. I savored every word, and would recommend it to anyone, particularly those who find appealing the idea of crawling into this dream of a circus for a little while.

B005E7AOHI|5.0|Primus is still as bonkers as it was when its anti-war single, \\"Too Many Puppies,\\" hit college radio airwaves in 1990, and caused the alt-rock world to sit up and take notice of the furious manner in which it could bend genres.<br /><br />For evidence of the weirdness at play, one need look no further than the song titles on \\"Green Naugahyde\\": Two include \\"salmon men\\" and one is named \\"Eyes of the Squirrel.\\" There are also shout-outs to Octomom and piano-playing cats, and a rarely executed \\"fester\\" / \\"child molester\\" rhyme.<br /><br />But what keeps this boat afloat is the hop-skipping, jingly jangly sound that refuses to settle down into any definable category. There are elements of metal, funk and prog at play, but the only constant is singer/bassist Les Claypool's carnival barker's bark. Claypool describes his band's sound as \\"psychedelic polka,\\" and that's as fitting as any other attempt at a quick explanation.<br /><br />There's no denying on this outing that Claypool's concentration on side projects over the past decade has changed the East Bay band's tempo. Reintroduced drummer Jay Lane, who last played in Primus when it was still making demos, also gives the music new heft, bringing aboard a heavy background in jazz and funk.<br /><br />\\"Green Naugahyde,\\" the band's seventh, and its first studio album in 12 years, is a more laid-back affair than Primus of yore. It's also the band's best release since 1993's \\"Pork Soda,\\" with which it shares the affinity for letting tunes air-dry.<br /><br />Musical interludes -- and there are lots of them -- come across more as jams than dexterity-defying exercises, one example being the entire jaw-dropping \\"Extinction Burst,\\" a malleable slice of space rock that wades into Bill Bruford-Bela Fleck waters. Echoes of Pink Floyd ripple through \\"Last Salmon Man,\\" a lament for America's tanking economy.<br /><br />This newfound approach is causing Deadheads to do double-takes. This is in large part due to the connection Claypool has through side band Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade to Ratdog, a band led by Grateful Dead's Bob Weir (Lane is part of Ratdog and Frog Brigade). If nothing else, Primus is a jam band for the fringe.<br /><br />Regardless of the less seat-of-the-pants, more jazz-fusion bent, every Primus release provides an unparalleled musical experience. It's also a series of short stories. Listeners are immersed in an American cultural wasteland populated by meth addicts, TV-watching zombies, conspiracy theorists, prostitutes and doomed dreamers.<br /><br />The doomed are in residence on \\"Naugahyde,\\" notably on the giddy, funky \\"Tragedy's a' Comin'\\" -- eerily reminiscent of early Red Hot Chili Peppers -- Claypool grunting, \\"When tragedy's pounding hard against your door / and the cancer's eating at your inner core / you're feeling helpless, can't control the game / be a fade-away softy, or go out in a ball of flame.\\" Or \\"Eternal Consumption Engine,\\" woozy like a belly full of sugar, a sarcastic salute to instant-gratification enslavement with \\"Every time I get a little bit bored / head to the Wally-Mart store / living high on the greasy hog / as long as they don't deport my child / cuz everything is made in China.\\"<br /><br />It might all be rather depressing if Primus wasn't having so much fun.<br /><br />Take the peppy, hillbilly-stompin' \\"Lee Van Cleef,\\" an ode to the \\"Bad\\" character from \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\\" Claypool, his voice sounding as if it's coming out of a CB radio, rapping more than singing the lines, \\"Nobody's steely like Lee Van Cleef / whatever happened to Lee?\\" as the bass and guitar loop around each other like air show stunts. The closest thing to an immediate standout track is the Parliament/Funkadelic-friendly \\"Hennepin Crawler,\\" which concerns a poor chap who \\"sold his soul for a donut hole.\\" Mouth-puckering bass played in zig-zags lords over the mix, Claypool deliriously blurting over and over toward the end, \\"You get to bitethat pie in the sky!\\"<br /><br />\\"Jilly's on Smack\\" finds Claypool sawing away at a stand-up bass, his voice unstable, cracking as he blurts, \\"Jilly had a smile / that spanned over a mile ... till she took a junkie lover / and began to fade.\\" Which seems sad on paper, but one's concern quickly shifts back to the question of Claypool's sanity when he begins to babble like a drunken auctioneer.unstable, cracking as he blurts, \\"Jilly had a smile / that spanned over a mile ... till she took a junkie lover / and began to fade.\\" Which seems sad on paper, but one's concern quickly shifts back to the question of Claypool's sanity when he begins to babble like a drunken auctioneer.

B0043EV774|5.0|This video is a great piece to show off your 3d setup.  The colors and the atmosphere really pop out at you.  There are some parallax issues that my wife said bothered her but it was mostly when the movie is tracking a subject behind the trees.  It does make it a bit confusing on what your eyes should be focusing on.    The movie itself has been enjoyed by my whole family though my youngest at 7 years old finds it a bit overwhelming.  Probably best for the 8+ crowd.    This should be in your 3d collection of blurays if it isn't already.
1594744769|2.0|My daughter had to read this for English honors.  She and I both hated it because of 1) crude and vulgar language and 2) the Disneyish stereotype of utterly stupid, out-of-touch, and useless parents vs. a gifted smart-mouthed child.  The obvious resolution for this foul little twerp?  Leave his parents forever, of course!  I'm leaving out a lot of the story but SERIOUSLY FOLKS!  THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CLASSICS OUT THERE!!!  I always hear the whiny objection: \\"but that's the way teenagers really talk\\".  No, not all teens, only the ones the objectors associate with.    By the way, I gave this review two stars because the author is gifted with words and I enjoyed some of the descriptions despite myself.  Hopefully he'll climb out of the shed full of ___t that he loves to write about and write something that inspires youth to greatness.

The accounts of  displaced parents who cling to old traditions and customs and their offspring who naturally want to take on the trappings of success in America have a familiarity no matter what your ethnic background is.
0316098337|2.0|I sure was expecting something after reading all the reviews.  It is written from a 5 year olds point of view, but rather inconsistently.  I found it rather unbelievable and I think it was written to ride on the coat tails of Jaycee Dugards story right after they found her.  I also have a feeling that the story was written hastily because the flow does not flow well.  I know I will be the odd man out on this review, but it really was disappointing.  Wait for the discount bin if you still want to read it.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|After reading many of the negative reviews, I thought it's best to write my experience with the product.     I had this pre-ordered for a while now, and since it was only $24, I was willing to give it a shot , just so I can stop moving furniture around every time I needed to use the KINECT.     So far it worked out. It is true that it's probably not that accurate, but I use it with Fitness Evolved, and it tracks things really well, I am surprised how much more closer to the sensor I can stand now.     Some people have mentioned that KINECT needs to see the floor or it re-calibrates, this is true, but there are instruction to fix that issue in the manual of the product. My KINECT is placed under the TV, so many that helped my situation.    Overall, for $24 it was worth it, I take this over having to move my furniture around (ie. heavy couch) every time i felt like playing a game. Which caused me to not use the KINECT as much.    It does create issues for gestures when watching HULU or Netflix because the \\"playing area\\" is now much closer to the TV, so the KINECT can't recognize you from your couch 8 feet away. But that's a given considering the wide-angle lens they use as a solution. For the money, the unit feels very solid and well made, I would have paid $75 for it, because for me the convenience this provides is just un-parralled. However, I always thought MS had a reason for not doing this, so I have feeling, the new and more advanced games that are coming out for the KINECT might not work so well with a wide-angle lens in front of it. But for $24 , who cares!
B002LVVCQM|1.0|Richard Dawkins has developed quite a reputation as a propagandist for the fallacies in the general theory of evolution. Again he leaps right in with declarations of \\"it's a fact\\" and he even has the audacity of comparing anti-evolutionists to holocaust deniers. You can immediately see the familiar shape of this man's twisted reasoning. After the Jews themselves, the Holocaust has its largest support from Christians, who are fellow Bible believers, and who are creationists. Evolution deniers, on the side of the Jews, should (thinks Dawkins) be on the side of evolution. If you don't deny an obvious fact of 20th century history, why deny the `fact' of his beloved theory?<br /><br />With the typical and willful ignorance of his camp, Dawkins fails to acknowledge, of course, that this same Holocaust was created by Nazi thugs who bought into the lie of evolution at full, vengeful throttle. For extra dark irony, Dawkins likens the alleged persecuted followers of the evolution religion to the real persecution of Christians and Jews - \\"they are harried and stymied, hassled and bullied, even threatened...\\" this is a stupendous analogy, totally false, of course. Creationist scientists who aspire to positions in the overwhelmingly atheist institutions of education around the world, are the ones who are harried and stymied. Want a cozy tenure in a university, after publicly declaring yourself a creationist? Off to the Darwinian labor camps of lower academia, you theistic imbecile! Universities which were once founded and maintained as Christian institutions (Harvard, Oxford) are now ripe with atheism. And rubbing salt into the wounds of irony, Dawkins wishes that we poor religionists would stop letting God get in the way of the grand something-from-nothing theory of the ages. \\"Why, I have the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury and a stable of British clergy on my side.\\"<br /><br />It seems that Dawkins (not a descendent of Adam and Eve, he assures us) has no problem going against the majority of believers in creationism. He has a better pedigree than mere `Bronze Age thinking' mortals: he is descended from silica and carbon jostled together by means unknown and is destined to be launched into a glorious Malthusian future against all the laws of logic and true science. Clear as mud, got it? Don't dare doubt his religion; it's as true as that grin on your Cousin Chimpanzee's face (\\"true as the 6 million Jews the theory helped to slaughter\\"), so there.<br /><br />Dawkins knows what a theory is (\\"a hypothesis confirmed by observation or experiment\\") or (\\"an explanation... speculation ... conjecture ... view ... notion ...\\") and he insists that scientists - evolutionists - practice the first and creationists - history deniers - practice the second. Evolution, he surmises, is as true as the earth circling the sun. Creationists, he believes, have mostly speculation and conjecture. It's intriguing to then follow this odd man through this book as he conclusively proves how his pet theory is `supported' by the laws, principles and/or causes of something known or observed, while he and all his evolutionist pals are at a loss to suggest what the cause of all causes is.<br /><br />We all know quite well that there would be only two ways to prove such a theory. First, you might observe it happening. Second, you might have historical evidence of it happening in the past, a record of it, so to speak. But don't let logic get in your way, reader. Let us follow the yellow brick road of Dawkinesque wisdom...<br /><br />As he did with theism in his book The God Delusion, Dawkins uses the same weapons of mis-direction here.  Space allows me only to touch on a few examples. Creationists, we're told, don't know what theory, facts, observation, scientific principles or proofs are made of. Dawkins wants us ignorant folk to know that evolution is a fact fact fact, with no doubt doubt doubt. What he does prove beyond doubt is that he's obnoxiously self-assured about having something more than a `conjecture that looks true but has never been proved'.<br /><br />He begins by declaring that ample evidence exists all around us, easily seen. He re-introduces natural selection as a mechanism of the theory.<br />Example 1: math, of all things, really can't lie. We'll come back to this eventually.<br />Example 2: what you think you see isn't always what's there. Actual observation is up against `scientific or careful inference'.<br />Dawkins, admittedly, makes good points with these examples. But he endeavors to illustrate the `irrefutable' power of suggestion (for that is what inference is) over hard fact. Which begs the question: \\"why not just stick to the facts?\\" Obviously, by claiming ultimate authority on what `seems' to be true, he can manipulate his theory in any direction he wishes. Speculation, suggestion, conjecture, all become `solid evidence'. Philosophy becomes proof. He wants the flexible gimmickry of circular reasoning (\\"I think, therefore it is!\\")<br /><br />Dawkins believes we can observe evolution happening in many ways, even now. And he believes that `reasonable doubt' of evolution being a fact is the understatement of all time. Dawkins now needs to disarm the classical philosophies; he disarmed God in his last book. So onwards: let's attack Plato.<br /><br />Plato has messed with our minds. He gave us `essential rabbits'. These will always be rabbits, nothing else. But evolution, Ernst Mayer style, gives us rabbitness of an infinite proclivity, called `population thinking'. Looking at the changes we do see within species, it's close to being a reasonable view. But infinity is a long time. We are being set up for a progression of change that (Dawkins would deny) runs smack dead into the wall of genetic limitations. Not a vague thought experiment, says Dawkins. \\"There really is a series of intermediate animals connecting a rabbit to a leopard, every one of whom lived and breathed...\\"  The other brick wall of missing fossils awaits this thought experiment.<br /><br />He is attempting to flesh out the branches of Darwin's idea tree (a tree of life on which Darwin scribbled `what if'). Branches have more branches, but they all have a single trunk, a single root system. It's a good analysis - if you can show the evidence of the grand ancestor of the branches, and the granddaddy root of them all. Who says that evolution isn't a philosophy based on faith?<br /><br />Dawkins leaps into horticulture and animal husbandry to demonstrate his points. And good points they are, commonly held by all of us. Cabbage varieties and dog varieties abide everywhere. There is a common ancestor to both. So far, so good, and why not? They are of the same `kind'. Breeding of new varieties leads us to an improvement in the species, or at least to something different. Artificial selection and natural selection go hand in hand. So what?<br /><br />The `what' is the deceitful lie here. Dawkins has been slyly leading us into the thought experiment that natural selection is powerful enough to create a wholly new species or order of life. He is, in a word, trying to peddle this lie by way of a softening-up process (his words). The evolutionist's greatest tool is a seductive argument that microevolution, given enough time, leads to macroevolution. And they do not like being taken to task on this idea. It is certainly a great deception, if you're not paying close attention.<br /><br />We are offered a few examples of evolution happening `right before our very eyes'. Lizards left to multiply on an island off Croatia, for example, developed distinct traits over just a few generations. They obviously changes via natural selection. This is true, but the reader must be aware that they are still the same species of lizards, not a snake or a wombat. Hunted elephants seem to have smaller tusks if they escape the hunters - again natural selection at work, but they are still elephants.<br /><br />It is sad to see Dawkins go on and on about natural selection, as he lectures us lesser beings on the wonders of evolution occurring right before us. Dawkins is forced to admit that \\"many of the problems that we meet in evolutionary argumentation arise only because animals are inconsiderate enough to evolve at different rates, and might even be inconsiderate enough not to evolve at all.\\" When we place together side by side the observations that there are changes within species (adaptive camouflage) and no changes of other species over eons of time, you must wonder why evolutionists will not consider the possibility that evolution just never occurred in the first place. We were dragged through the process of looking at 45 thousand generations of e. coli which still ended up with e. coli. Why should we expect there would be any change over 45,000 or more generations of humans? In truth, there wasn't.<br /><br />At one point, Dawkins stumbles into the geological column models when he quotes from a creationist article (I've abbreviated it even more here):<br />\\"INVERTEBRATES...would perish first ... followed by silt...<br />AMPHIBIA ... would perish next as the waters rose...<br />REPTILES ... would be next to die...<br />MAMMALS ... after that ... from rising water etc...<br />MAN ... would exercise most ingenuity - would be last ...<br />This sequence is a perfectly satisfactory explanation of the order in which the various fossils are found in the strata. It is NOT the order in which they evolved but the order in which they were inundated at the time of Noah's flood.\\"<br /><br />This order makes perfect sense, according to massive flood geology. But Dawkins goes on to say something like this: \\"Quite apart from all the other reasons to object to this remarkable explanation, there could only ever be a statistical tendency for mammals, for example, to be on average better at escaping the rising waters than reptiles. Instead, as we should expect on the evolution theory, there literally are no mammals in the lower strata of the geological record. The `head for the hills' theory would be on more solid ground if there were a statistical tailing off of mammals as you move down through the rocks...\\" Did you catch that? He objects to the creation model here merely because it conflicts with evolutionary geology, regardless of the fact that flood geology would indeed produce the above scenario. Dawkins, like all evolutionists, can't abide the idea of another geological event with sensible support for it.<br /><br /> Now Dawkins tells us that of course, we don't really need fossils to prove anything. Nonetheless he launches into the vague and scattered record of the geology. It is the same old arbitrary declaration of `fact' in naming what he thinks are transitions in that record, even when they clearly aren't any such thing. It is sad to see a man suffer so badly from foot-in-mouth disease like this man does. No fossils needed? Then why rant on and on about fossils, only to wind up making false declarations about what they actually show us? Addressing the `missing link' controversy, Dawkins maintains there isn't any such thing. Of course, he can only peddle this tripe by way of arbitrarily claiming that different fossils that seem to bear a resemblance to an intermediate stage between two different creatures are in fact related and thus descendants. Such claims right out of the blue can only serve one purpose: to parade themselves as `evidence' of species change to-and-from sea to land etc. it apparently never enters the evolutionist mindset that these fossilized creatures were even anything but fully formed creatures in their own right.<br /><br />Instead of addressing true challenges from knowledgeable creation scientists, Dawkins prefers to quote the silliest of creation claims, with stuff like \\"show me a crockoduck\\" and \\"a monkey giving birth to a human baby, please\\" and that sort of ilk. Unfortunately, there really are alleged creationists out there who are ignorant enough to use these incredibly stupid terms. Dawkins should know better, but while correctly telling us that a false Piltdown Man didn't defang evolution theory (and why should it?), he seems content to parade the stupidity of certain ignorant creation supporters in front of us, as if we all are so inclined.<br /><br />How sad it is that in his introduction to this book, he first defined `fact' as being something more concrete than a mere inference or conjecture (and he's correct in that), but then he goes on to state that he would use a scientific version of such inferences. [\\"This book will take inference seriously - not mere inference but proper scientific inference - and I shall show the irrefragable power of the inference that evolution is a fact.\\"] If a creationist tried such a stunt, he or she would be understandably laughed out of the classroom of the world! This entire book, however (like the theory) is based on nothing but lame inferences, conjectures, suppositions, assumptions and inferences.<br /><br />Examples of his rampant diversionary arrogance is everywhere. I will not waste more time on it here.<br /><br />Evolutionists have always tried to maintain as fact that which is mere theory or hypothesis. Dawkins repeatedly uses phrases in his explanations such as \\"they must be common enough to account for speciation\\", \\"fauna and flora of the islands must have traveled there\\", \\"perhaps the island population changed more than the mainland population\\", \\"What actually happened at this epic parting of the ways, nobody knows. It happened a very long time ago, and we have no idea where...\\", \\"I shall in the rest of this chapter  assume that the initial separation that precedes speciation is normally geographical\\", \\"one might really fancy that\\", \\"it might be supposed that\\", \\"presumably\\", \\"evidently evolved separately\\", \\"almost certainly how at least some of...\\", and \\"could almost imagine\\".<br /><br />Must be...<br />Must have...<br />Perhaps...<br />Nobody knows...<br />We have no idea...<br />I shall assume...<br />Fancy that...<br />Supposed...<br />Evidently...<br />Almost certainly...<br />Almost imagine...<br /><br />This is the language that pervades this theory. Yet they insist on calling it overwhelming `facts'. Dawkins wants even the creation theory to be sustained only along the guidelines of evolution theory! If his reasoning were to be adhered to, why didn't humans not also evolve in Australia or the Americas, if the power off natural selection is as powerful as he thinks it is? An all-powerful creator need not create species in specific locations if the mechanics of migration will allow for this dispersal. Dawkins actually launches into one of those mechanisms - plate tectonics - which unwittingly illustrates why a Noah's Ark epicenter can spawn diverse and separate species worldwide, all from a common gene pool of those various species.<br /><br />He suggests that \\"everything points to a simple branching tree of ancestry - a family tree\\", and blithely ignores the biblical theme of `kinds after their kind', created in place, at once, as being a somehow \\"embarrassingly far-fetched one\\". Woe betides the creationist who would level the same condemnation against the evolution theory! It is the ever-present fallacy of expecting a Creator to remain in line with the reasoning standard of evolution, and remains the biggest barrier of an evolutionist understanding a creation theory on its own basis.<br /><br />How odd that Dawkins cannot bring himself to accept the hypothesis that an all-powerful Creator would not possibly `borrow' the idea of one creature in the creation of another. It is tantamount of saying that God lacked imagination, which is contrary to being a creator of omnipotent power in the first place. He rants on with topics such as deep geologic time, atomic theory, chemistry, sedimentation, global flooding, world distribution of animals, homology, intelligent design, molecular clocks, pseudogenes, shoving his BS ideas down the reader's throat en masse, going so far wide of the mark that it hurts the brain to contemplate it all.  But then evolutionists like Dawkins cannot, will not, dare not confront the very question that debunks and disarms all their theories: just where IS the origin of everything?

Now after hearing what lucas has done yet again I am not buying any.  I am so done with Lucas and Star Wars.  Instead of making more movies he just keeps screwing up the only 3 good movies he ever made.  It's just proof that he can't make anything else.<br />  I have every dam version that was ever put out from the original VHS tapes, special edition vhs tapes, special edition laserdiscs, dvd etc.  Not this time George.  It's too bad that someone who redifined the industry in the 1970's hasn't put out a good film since.  He just keeps ruining the films that made him RICH and famous.  And the BEST Star Wars movie he did'nt even direct! RIP Irving Kirschner.<br />  Well, at least I still have my vhs tapes of the originals untouched by his hands.<br />  I know these films are his and he can do what he wants with them but if not for me and the millions of other Star Wars fans out there he would be in no position to do anything.  So all I can do is simply not add to his already overflowing coffers any more.  Good Bye George..  Thanks for (ruining) the memories.
0812550757|5.0|When Orson Scott Card wrote his enticing novel, Ender's Game, in 1985, he introduced the fiction world to a memorable character, Andrew Wiggins. This gave the world of interplanetary warfare a whole new slant: a remote controlled war between two alien species, fought by specially gifted children. In that novel, Wiggins (nicknamed Ender because his baby sister Valentine couldn't pronounce his name Andrew) joins a training camp in high Earth orbit for young soldiers and he is so good at it that he is designated a leader in a conflict with Buggers, an alien race of beings. Ender the prodigy (without knowing he was doing so) successfully defeats the Buggers and in fact destroys the entire race. Only after this war does he discover that the race of Buggers were not only very intelligent, they were not predatory. Ender falls into a huge pit of despair and sets off on an interstellar journey of preaching peace and restoration between species. But only humans remain, and so he goes from world to world where humans live, speaking out in defense of the oppressed victims. He becomes known as the Speaker for the Dead, and the secret identity of Ender the Xenocide is well-kept. What makes the novel so intriguing is the way in which Card fleshed out the complex mind of Ender and his sister and the deceit which is practiced in the military world which surrounds him. War against a hated enemy isn't always what it is propagandized to be, as Ender found out after playing his hi-tech games so well.<br /><br />Speaker For The Dead continues where Ender's game left off, and it is also so good that it consequently also won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for sci-fi (1986, 1987). Card introduces us to the world of Lusitania (an ancient name for Portugal, actually) where scientists are studying another alien race of beings. These are called the porquinhos, or piggies, because they resemble a porcine mammal that walks upright, are very smart and want to know anything they can know from the human colonists. They want to travel to the stars as well. But a confederation of the Hundred Worlds establishes a barrier between humans and the piggies, who are only the second intelligent race of beings to be discovered. Only one pair at a time of select scientists, or xenobiologists, are allowed to interface with the piggies, but never to divulge technological secrets to them. It's the old scenario of a prime directive or non-interference. The piggies must be allowed to evolve on their own. But the piggies are learning because they are clever and smarter than the humans think. When a couple of bizarre killings take place on Lusitania, one of the scientists sends out a plea for a Speaker for the dead to come and tell the story of the dead man's life.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ender is living on the planet of Trondheim where his married sister Valentine also lives, when he receives this summons as the Speaker. He is constantly on the outlook for any opportunity to act as ambassador to the dead. He packs up and leaves his sister and her husband and goes by near-to-lightspeed starship to Lusitania. Though this journey takes but one week, over twenty-two years pass in normal time. This is a world of space travel which isn't as fast as light but of communication which is instant, by way of the inexplicable device known as an ansible. The woman who summoned him to Lusitania, Novinha, changes her mind - she has her own huge collection of painful problems, explained in the beginning chapters. But two of her children summon him anyway, not for the murdered scientist but for the death of their own father. It is a rule of the galaxy that if the Speaker for the Dead is summoned to speak a death, he is allowed to investigate and make a public proclamation of what really happened. Although he is unwanted by many when he arrives on Lusitania, he goes ahead with his chore regardless. In the process, a lot of secrets become aired and mysteries cleared up.<br /><br />Ender'srole as a Speaker is in fact like an international investigator of a mystery. He in fact researches the life of the victim and then presents a public eulogy of the person to the people involved. It has been his continuing role on behalf of the race of Buggers he helped to destroy and wants to memorialize to everyone else. In a way, Ender is a Devil's Advocate, bringing closure to painful deaths. But he is also personally searching for a form of forgiveness for himself and his mammoth guilt as Ender the Destroyer in the Bugger war. Ender, by traveling between the stars, has aged only thirty-some years but to the rest of humanity he is over three thousand years old. Both Ender the Xenocide and the Speaker for the Dead are legends at opposite ends of the spectrum.<br /><br />Card has presented a very compelling novel in this story of Ender on Lusitania. In many ways, it is the search for forgiveness through understanding, and about restoration and redemption of everybody involved. Card has a gift for involving the reader in the characters - you care about these people on both sides of the equation of pain and guilt. It is trademark of Card to tell these stories from a strong character-based perspective and he does it extremely well. The exchange of dialogues between characters are among the most controversial and yet uplifting aspect of the novel. Christian religion (at least a version of Catholicism and Mormonism) is involved in a constructive and helpful way here. Both Ender and the bishop/priest on Lusitania act like psychologists for the rest of the cast of characters. The conflict is ideological but it is always sensitive and realistic. I often found myself wondering why Ender feels so guilty (as in the previous novel) because it wasn't really his fault; but then, human guilt is often bizarre. It is poignant to observe the interplay between Ender and Novinha. She hates him at first but she sees how he has drawn out the feelings of her afflicted children and formed a bond with them in his searching out of the family secrets. For his part, Ender knows he has been drawn to Lusitania because he so readily identifies with the huge pain of the woman who summoned him. Novinha herself is ridden with great guilt which she was not responsible for but for which she has inflicted inhumane punishment on herself throughout her life on Lusitania. Only with the exposing of the facts and a purging of the soul can these characters be healed, and that is what Ender's gifts seem to accomplish, both for them and for himself. There are a few other surprises, nice ones, in the latter part of the novel, all of them very human and very believable.<br /><br />Reading Speaker For The Dead is like a slow therapy of the mind and soul for the turmoil that is introduced through the characters. Card may be explaining his own history here, as he spent time in Brazil as a Mormon missionary who dealt with indigenous tribes interacting with outsiders who were exploiting them. This also explains the strong Portuguese element in this novel, though it never gets in the way of fine narrative. It also reminds me of the characterization in Frederick Pohl's \\"Gateway\\" series, where it deals in the first person with the troubled character of Robinette Broadhead, another guilt-ridden protagonist. Still one more comparison is to \\"The Priest's Tale\\", an episode in the splendid novel Hyperion by Dan Simmonds. Great speculative fiction, as this is, should deal with either the conflict of interspecies mingling or the affects of science and technology on a grand scale on the world (or universe) at large. This does both very, very well. We all have guilt of some sort and we all need forgiveness and redemption of some kind. Orson Scott Card is one of the better writers handling this issue in sci-fi.

0060765488|4.0|Okay, I finally got around to reading one of the most famous children's fantasies series ever done.  Depending on who you talk to, this is actually the second book in the series if you read it by topic, but Lewis wrote this one first, dedicating it to his goddaughter Lucy Barfield. While perusing the Large Print editions of fiction in my local library, I was very pleased to discover this entire series by Lewis, and it is the illustrated version to boot! (Illustrations are b&w line sketches by Pauline Baynes, much like the illustrated edition of the classic Wind in the Willows). The text of the book runs about 44,000 words so it is not a lengthy or deep read. It is intended for young children, possibly to be read to them. But this entire series is also an allegorical tale of Christianity, not just a simple fairy tale.<br /><br />In the first book of the series (thematically speaking), Lewis tells of creation, when he relates how The Magician's Nephew  plays a part in the creation of the world of Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is therefore a children's tale about triumph over evil, about the Christ and his redemption and the kingdom of God restored back to faithful believers, and the defeat of Satan. The gospel in a juvenile nutshell, to be exact.  In the subsequent books of the series, Lewis deals with fulfilling our destiny with God's plan for our life (The Horse and His Boy); joy in the midst of tempest, with Christ as our conqueror (Prince Caspian); how we can be influenced by a future eternity if our hearts are set toward heaven (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader); a victorious hope against death with our resurrection (The Silver Chair); and the coming Armageddon and return of Jesus Christ and the new heaven and earth (The Last Battle). This all makes compelling reading, when you consider the hopelessness and misdirected avenues taken in sagas such as the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, which are sword and sorcery without any redeeming values.<br /><br />The story is very simple. Four children, Peter, Lucy, Susan and Edmund, all brothers and sisters, are sent away to a safe house in the English countryside to avoid the WW2 blitz in London. A friendly Professor takes them in. they explore the huge and strange house they are in and accidentally discover a magical passageway into a frozen world full of odd creatures. Lucy first falls through the doors of a wardrobe in one of the rooms, and discovers the world of Narnia. The others follow soon thereafter, and are soon involved in the mystery of this place. They get to meet Aslan, the lion king of Narnia, who has returned to reclaim his kingdom from the wicked White Witch. A sacrifice is made and a battle or two is fought, and Narnia is saved. This is plainly the good vs evil of the gospel accounts of the Christian Bible.<br /><br />Aslan (surely the original `lion king') is a type of Christ, right up to his sacrificial death at the hands of the witch (Satan). Lewis wastes no time about fine details but carries his young characters right along briskly from scene to scene. I was a bit put off by the appearance of the character of Father Christmas and his reindeer and sleigh and gifts (a type of Santa) but at least Lewis had the courtesy to have this jolly guy praise the king (Aslan) as the real power of giving and love and joy. The entire story is chock-block full of Christian typology, in spite of many critics thinking otherwise. Lewis was perhaps the last century's best and most loved Christian apologist, and he has given the world of youth something very moralistic and divine to sink their teeth into here.<br /><br />I have no doubt that I will read the others sometime. I was prompted to read this one now because there is a very recent movie release based on this particular book, and I want to see it as well. The movie versions of the world of Narnia which were done before were effective in their day, including an animated TV series. The British are experts at this sort of thing. There are even Bible study courses using the characters in this enduring book series. The website ChristianityToday.com offers a lot of help in that direction. Walden Media, a division of Walt Disney Pictures, has produced the latest version of this story in full feature mode, and it is directed by Andrew Adamson, who also directed the previously successful and popular movies Shrek and Shrek II. While the movie audiences of the world seem to be on a quest for mythological escapism at the theaters, there isn't a great deal there of intelligent design or of upright moral teachings. This is a refreshing difference, and the old saying that \\"the book is usually better\\" is still very true in this age of computer-generated images and highly paid actors.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of science fantasy or any of the plethora of sword & sorcery literature out there - I've rarely seen the sense of it all. But if good themes and morals can be portrayed in an entertaining and different way, I will pay attention. While Tolkein's Lord of the Ring series bored me to no end (movies included) and while Harry Potter or the Wizard of Oz or the uncounted TV series which barf out those constant and stilted tales of witches and ghosts and phantom warriors and occultic happenstances, a series like this, composed by someone I personally consider to be the most capable writer in the English languange of the past century, is a treat in every way. An older child-centered adventure that is slow but more appealing is The Princess and the Goblin by George Macdonald, who was an important influence on Lewis.e even Bible study courses using the characters in this enduring book series.

B0043RSE2M|2.0|I just recently opened this package for my nieces and come to find out that the digital copy was NOT included!  I am disappointed that I trusted what I was buying and did not take a closer look.
0618918248|1.0|Richard Dawkins, an Oxford biologist and popular science writer, has well established himself as one of the foremost proponents of both modern evolutionary theory and atheism. It should be of no surprise that these two go hand in hand. In The God Delusion, Dawkins has tried to dispel the whole notion of a supreme deity. He contends that a faith in a God is delusional because it is faith based on false beliefs in contradictory evidence. It's a huge claim, even bolder than Darwin's theory itself, as it purports to dispose of not many gods but all gods. Dawkins establishes his main claim on page 54: \\"That you cannot prove God's nonexistence is accepted and trivial, if only in the sense that we can never absolutely prove the non-existence of anything. What matters is not whether God is disprovable (he isn't) but whether his existence is probable.\\" With a claim like that (those are his words, not mine), Dawkins has bit off more than he can chew. It's a self-defeating postulate, and everything he subsequently says goes downhill very quickly. Dawkins simply cannot offer a believable argument for the delusion he thinks exists. I cannot help but be reminded of the wise adage that in order to prove that God doesn't exist, you'd need infinite knowledge of the entire universe. Since this is beyond anybody's ability, this professor should have given up, but he trudges on, in a book-length diatribe against all religions.<br /><br />Dawkins is left with the contention that God's existence is not probable. Again, this is an argument that cannot be won. For example, the origins of everything cannot be explained by any science. If a Big Bang came from a parallel universe and time, what caused that universe to exist? What scientific theory fills this gap? Did it come from anther pre-existing power that brings forth what we do know about? Where would that power comes from? This is unproductive reasoning which leads to no beginning, no matter how far you stretch it. Atheists admit they don't know where everything began, but they casually dismiss a creator as being impossible. It's a common logical fallacy in their camp. The mainline theistic argument is that one supreme God exists and that this God created everything from nothing. Impossible? Where the natural ends, you must consider the supernatural. It's clear however that Dawkins has intellectually lobotomized himself when he, like other atheists, deny even the possibility of supreme deity, while admitting it cannot be disproved.<br /><br />Things get really strange when Dawkins makes statements such as \\"who designed the designer?\\" and \\"the little we know about God, the one thing we can be sure of is that he would have to be very, very complex and presumably irreducibly so!\\" It appears that this man has no concept of absolute deity, or that he has chosen to ignore it altogether. The universe, he thinks, is far too complex to be designed by intelligence, yet he can attribute no origins to any science he would allude to.<br /><br />Dawkins ignores the very idea of irreducible complexity, something that God must have by virtue of an absolute nature. Even a school child acknowledges that nobody designed the Designer (God); that's why he is God. In trying to disprove Aquinas' 5 proofs (of a reason to suppose God's existence), he categorically dismisses it as being `vacuous'. Dawkins hates infinite regress, but he cannot explain his way out of it, and will not admit to an alternative. The Unmoved Mover, the Uncaused Cause, and the Cosmological Argument (nothingness into something) are, says Dawkins, not a reason to invoke a God. But he is unable to invoke anything himself in its place. Good enough to toss out the God he admits he cannot disprove? I hardly think so.<br /><br />Try this bit of Dawkins illogical reasoning on for size: \\"Even if we allow the dubious luxury of arbitrarily conjuring up a terminator to an infinite regress and giving it a name, simply because we need one, there is absolutelyno reason to endow that terminator with any of the properties normally ascribed to God: omnipotence, omniscience, goodness, creativity of design...\\" Why not, Mr Dawkins? There isn't an existing knowable science that can be applied to an explanation of a Beginning, so what's your alternative? This allegedly brilliant scientist claims that \\"intelligent design is not the proper alternative to chance\\", yet he admits that though theology is not his department, he arbitrarily throws out deity as nonsense. This is further aggravated by his claim that \\"it (a first cause of everything...something from nothing) must have been simple and therefore, whatever else we call it, God is not an appropriate name...\\" Dawkins denies the universally accepted Second Law of Thermodynamics, whereby entropy increases (or in which complexity moves towards chaos). Evolution and natural selection, he believes, is bringing order out of chaos, in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Does he believe the universe is a closed system, not subject to natural laws? Where is the Edge of it all, Mr Dawkins? If you even consider reversing this law or abdicating it, it is all the more reason for an intelligent designer.<br /><br />Contradictions keep piling up with this man. At one point he claims \\"Believing is not something you can decide to do as a matter of policy. At least, it is not something I can decide to do as an act of will.\\" Then he quotes from Steven Pinker: \\"it [religion] only raises the question of why a mind would evolve to find comfort in beliefs it can plainly see are false...\\" Wait a minute, beliefs it can plainly see are false? So, where's this lack of choice in believing, Mr Dawkins? Oh, of course, it all comes from some sort of \\"formidable power of the brain's simulation software..[which is] well capable of constructing<br />'visions' and 'visitations' of the utmost veridical power.\\" Hearing him put it this way, you just have to wonder which of these constructed visions has caused him to suspend logic and make the earlier proclamation of \\"...there are very probably alien civilizations that are superhuman, to the point of being god-like in ways that exceed anything a theologian could possibly imagine.\\" Here is the non-theologian, outguessing the professional theologian with impunity, claiming \\"I would prefer to say that if indeed they [mysteries of life] lie beyond science, they most certainly lie beyond the province of theologians as well.\\" And we believers have a God delusion?<br /><br />On what authority does Dawkins rob the theologian of the imagination which he himself does not possess? It is akin to the infamous Arthur C. Clarke quote: \\"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\\". This ruse, that religion is a way to explain inexplicable science, is painfully shallow. Magic is illusion, not delusion, and religion is in the realm of metaphysics. Nevertheless, Dawkins won't allow metaphysics (there's no God, he says), but will allow meta-analysis when it suits him, ie regarding the nature of belief systems. Quoting Paul Bell from Mensa Magazine, Dawkins (ever the evolutionary biologist) thinks that the more advanced the (evolved) human mind, the less likelihood of a God-belief. Again, a classic denial of universal entropy, that energy in all systems is cruising from order into chaos. As always, Dawkins simply refuses to carry his scientific reasoning to the point of explaining origins. At the risk of repetition here, if Dawkins thinks there is a sufficient explanation via the sciences for the beginning of everything, and that we just need more time to unravel the mysteries therein, he nevertheless avoids the paradox of where those explanations themselves come from. Regardless of what is offered as the first beginning, it too must have an origin. Here is an Oxford professor who is stumped by infinite regress and cannot simply and honestly admit it. Everything else he tries to amplify in this book it moot.<br /><br />The book slumps to a low of scientific petulance when it disregards origins and dismisses metaphysical aspects of human existence all because Dawkins will not enter into alternate reasons for existence other than purely scientific ones. His plea for science is a plea for ignorance, considering he cannot offer a reason for existence itself, but categorically refuses to admit any other possibility than those he wishes to accept himself. This sends him into the self-deluding realm of intellectual arrogance, and there is a lot of arrogance here. Consider again some more of his own words: \\"It is important not to miss-state the reach of natural selection. Selection does not favor the evolution of a cognitive awareness of what is good for your genes. That awareness had to wait for the twentieth century to reach a cognitive level, and even now full understanding is confined to a minority of scientific specialists.\\" An awareness that waited, and only reveals itself in a minority of specialists? Would Dawkins be one of those chosen few? He further says (in a subtle nod towards infinite regress and multiple beginnings): \\"If we are going to permit the extravagance of a multiverse, so the argument runs, we might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb and allow a God. Aren't they both equally unparsimonious ad hoc hypotheses, and equally unsatisfactory?\\" It appears that Dawkins doesn't think a multiverse is allowable; it is, in fact, `extravagant'. But he continues: \\"...People who think that... have not had their consciousness raised by natural selection. The key difference between the genuinely extravagant God hypothesis and the apparently extravagant multiverse hypothesis is one of statistical improbability. The multiverse, for all that it is extravagant, is simple. God, or any intelligent, decision-taking, calculating agent, would have to be highly improbable in the very same statistical sense as the entities he is supposed to explain.\\" Did you catch that? Dawkins believes a God cannot be more complex than his creation. Still, he plunders onwards: \\"... The multiverse may seem extravagant in sheer number of universes. But if each one of those universes is simple in its fundamental laws, we are still not postulating anything highly improbable. The very opposite has to be said of any kind of intelligence.\\" So, some of us have not had their consciousness raised by natural selection. Poor blokes we are, not to have the advantage of the understandings that Dawkins' class have. Such undeveloped slugs are we, who consider a God behind all of those possible multiverses.<br /><br />The delusion of a God, which Dawkins says most of us suffer from (and we could not chose to believe in this God, as choice to believe is not possible, remember?) is therefore the basis of all the religions which have ruined and are still destroying the world. Having shot himself in the foot and lost the argument in the first place, Dawkins nonetheless proceeds to castigate every religion on the planet as being unsavory and useless. He doesn't tread any new territory here - the inhumanity of man towards fellow man is not denied by anybody else. But to appeal to an atheist universe for order is both ignorant and arrogant in the highest order. Dawkins merely illustrates his own lack of knowledge of religion in general and an absolute God in particular. There are hints that he personally suffered at the hands of irresponsible religious behavior as a youth, but is this reason to dismiss God? Apparently, Dawkins thinks so. Morals for good behavior, he states, don't have to come from a God. \\"Do you really mean,\\" he continues to whine, \\"to tell me the only reason you try to be good is to gain God's approval and reward, or to avoid his disapproval and punishment? That's not morality, that's just sucking up, apple polishing, looking over your shoulder at the great surveillance camera in the sky...\\" And yet, he is unable to demonstrate how a moral nature can only evolve, and not be embedded by deity. You have to wonder where his moral imperative stems from, or what it is he sucks up to.<br /><br />To further dismantle the God hypothesis (as he calls all religion), he cherry-picks scripture to illustrate what he believes is \\"the monster of the Bible.\\" In Genesis, Lot (says Dawkins) was willing to give his daughters to strangers and later, under the influence, copulated with them. A monster God saw to this! \\"Is this the best morals that Sodom had to offer?\\" But Dawkins fails to mention that God never approved of any of this. The same goes for Abraham who prepares to sacrifice his son, Isaac. (\\"A last minute change of plan? God was only joking...\\") Willingness to obey, to trust, to commit to an absolute God who is ultimately good and just and gave plenty of gracious forewarnings, seems beyond Dawkins ability to conceive. So is divine forgiveness. Atonement (ie the Christ story) is \\"barking mad, vicious, sado-masochistic and repellant.\\" It is interesting that he regards the moral character of Jesus to be admirable (though Christ, he deems, is fictional), yet he is unable to grasp the need for a divine accounting and forgiveness before a divine God. Redemption should not have been necessary (ie Calvary), thinks Dawkins. \\"If God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them?\\" What does Dawkins desire, an auto-God who forgets all, forgives all? Such a God, who never allowed evil to exist or things to go wrong, would never allow free will and choice either. We would all be automatons, incapable of doing wrong - clearly not the case with humanity. But once again, the professor who admits he's not a theist would just erase all semblances of religious logic from the debate.<br /><br />Yet, fearfully aware of that paradox of infinite regress and a beginning which is ever scientifically inexplicable, Dawkins moans out his atheist plea. \\"The whole argument turns on the familiar question: Who Made God, which most thinking people discover for themselves. A designer God cannot be used to explain organized complexity because any God capable of designing anything would have to be complex enough to demand the same kind of explanation in his own right. God presents an infinite regress from which he cannot help us to escape.\\" Cannot help us to escape? Is it not the very reason that we cannot scientifically explain that infinite regress, Mr Dawkins, that it is only God who can be the originator of it, and be himself beyond it? British literary critic Terry Eagleton was quite right in saying that Dawkins exhibits \\"astounding ignorance ... about what he's talking about\\". Eagleton says \\"for deeply intelligent men Dawkins (and Christopher Hitchens) have a crude, childlike caricature of religion that would make any first-year theology student wince.\\" For a university graduate and an accomplished biologist, you have to wonder why Dawkins pursues the ideas in this book beyond the first chapter. Even in his argument, The Dawkins Confession, writer Alvin Plantinga clearly illustrates the  convolutions of this Dawkinesque non-reasoning, that disproving the material basis of religion does not disprove the other reasons for it.<br /><br />Yet Dawkins rants on. Elevating himself above the mainstream of believers, we find him mouthing the likes of \\"All I am establishing is that modern morality, wherever else it comes from, does not come from the Bible. Apologists cannot get away with claiming that religion provides them with some sort of inside track to defining what is good and what is bad - a privileged source unavailable to atheists.\\" This is a truly ignorant statement when you consider that apologists do not make any such claim. Biblical apologists in fact maintain that the moral nature we have from God is available to everyone and is implanted within every person. There are no privileged sources for morality. Just the same, Dawkins then tries to demolish this `inside track' by claiming \\"the holy books do not supply any rules for distinguishing the good principles from the bad.\\" Had he simply looked in the Bible's New Testament a little further, he would have discovered the phrases of \\"blessed are the pure, the meek, the merciful, the peacemakers...\\", for surely in the sermon on the mount we have the golden code of moral behavior. Even if New Testament verses were cherry-picked throughout, it is difficult not to see moral instruction and the rules for it. But Dawkins would rather we are pointed toward a set of New Ten Commandments (for atheists) which strangely are similar to the old ones. Ironically, while he would subscribe to these (ie, \\"Always respect the right of others to disagree with you\\" and \\"Treat your fellow human beings...with love, honesty, faithfulness and respect) he taunts the believer in God with his own insulting belief that \\"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.\\" By this, he means respect?<br /><br />Dawkins is certainly at his most vain and ignorant when he tries to foist the idea upon the reader (who is smarter than he gives her/him credit for) that a world of atheism would be the utopia we all need. After sharpening his teeth on the monstrous acts of the Stalins and Hitlers of history and presenting them as Christians (in spite of their ungodly nature!), he makes still another astounding claim: \\"I cannot think of any war that has been fought in the name of atheism. Why should it?\\" While Dawkins does not disown the idea of atheistic warfare, he is trying to disown the atheistic reason for them. It is so convenient here for him to forget the wars of communism everywhere, such as Russia, Cuba, Cambodia, Columbia, and China. Millions were slaughtered for simply having religious beliefs in any sort of gods. Even as he wrote this, Dawkins surely was aware of the atheist war against the Falun Gong of China. Communistic warfare is atheistic in its very purpose, and answers the very question Dawkins asks when he whimpers \\"By contrast, why would anyone go to war for the sake of an absence of belief?\\" The mind cries out: to stop religious wars, Dawkins, and to stop religion.<br /><br />Furthering the hypocritical agenda he loves to throw at us, he unabashedly supports another atheistic war, the war on unborn children. Abortion, to Dawkins, is merely the destruction of a cluster of human cells for the convenience of the mother. Yet even using his \\"consequentialist moral philosophy\\" in regards to the fetus, he walks on dangerous ground. Listen to this: \\"An early embryo has the sentience, as well as the semblance, of a tadpole. A (murdered abortionist) doctor is a grown-up conscious being with hopes, loves, aspirations, fears, a massive store of humane knowledge...\\" etc. It is only with the reasoning of an evolutionary atheist that you could dismiss an unborn baby as being of no worth. Adding euthanasia to the mix, Dawkins enters the same murderous territory that Hitler trod upon with his extinction of the masses of WW2. It's not that Dawkins favors snuffing out lives at either end of the spectrum, but rather that he doesn't recognize them as lives. Even the Great Beethoven Fallacy escapes him - a life euthanized for any reason is a life never given its potential. This doesn't deter Dawkins; he considers the possibility of a future life being quenched to be \\"a ridiculous story\\", a rhetorical stupidity, and surreal idiocy. But surreal idiocy is what Dawkins then practices in spades: \\"The evolutionary point is very simple. The humanness of an embryo's cells cannot confer upon it any absolutely discontinuous moral status. It cannot, because of our evolutionary continuity with chimpanzees and, more distantly, with every species on the planet.\\" A classic evolutionist tactic: assign the human fetus a non-human ancestry, so it can be destroyed at will. \\"There is no general reason,\\" continues Dawkins, \\"to suppose that human embryos at any age suffer more than cow or sheep embryos at the same developmental stage. And there is every reason to suppose that all embryos, whether human or not, suffer far less than adult cows or sheep in a slaughterhouse...\\" He could learn a great deal about this suffering by watching the anti-abortion film The Hidden Holocaust. But this is not murder in Dawkins view because \\"there are no natural borderlines in evolution\\"; therefore species have different values at different stages of development. An unborn child is not worth an adult life; a murdered fetus is not the calamity that a murdered (abortionist) doctor is. Lives in the distant past aren't of the same moral value as lives now. Do such lives (fetus, dying terminal patient, Australopithecus afarensis) count as human? For Dawkins, \\"the question doesn't deserve an answer, for nothing turns on it.\\" Nothing turns on it? Except, perhaps, Dawkins' own existence. That's evolutionist and atheist morals in a nutshell.<br /><br />Religion, then, is an imaginary voice in the head, because we don't have enough science to explain all of our surroundings. Dawkins would explain that \\"the simulation software in the brain is especially adept at constructing faces and voices.\\" God is a voice, so God is a delusion. \\"Such is the fatuousness of the religiously indoctrinated mind\\" he adds, \\"a mind hijacked by religious faith...\\". Yet he has no problem whatsoever with other voices, ie the witness of Julia Sweeney who confesses \\". . . as I was walking from my office in my backyard into my house, I realized there was this little teeny-weenie voice whispering in my head. I'm not sure how long it had been there, but it suddenly got just one decibel louder. It whispered, 'There is no god.'\\" But of course, this voice is legitimate because it sanctions Dawkins' all-beloved atheism.<br /><br />If there is delusion to be found, it is not with the existence of God, but with the petulant arrogance displayed throughout this book, time after time, by Richard Dawkins himself. It is clear that the thought never enters his mind that you cannot disprove God by sampling the horrid actions of humanity. To believe in a Creator, for Dawkins, is just pure nonsense. It will corrupt our schoolchildren and pollute our society. \\"The faithful (to God) are encouraged to profess belief,\\" concludes Dawkins, \\"whether they are convinced by it or not. Maybe if you repeat something often enough, you will succeed in convincing yourself of its truth.\\" Strangely enough, if you profess evolutionary theory and atheistic non-theory often enough, you might succeed in convincing yourself of its truth as well. The formidable power of the brain's simulation software is in all likelihood a two-edged sword, and it can cut Dawkins as deeply as it can cut the rest of us. For me, the grand logic of Pascal's Wager still stands.al imperative stems from, or what it is he sucks up to.    To further dismantle the God hypothesis (as he calls all religion), he cherry-picks scripture to illustrate what he believes is \\"the monster of the Bible.\\" In Genesis, Lot (says Dawkins) was willing to give his daughters to strangers and later, under the influence, copulated with them. A monster God saw to this! \\"Is this the best morals that Sodom had to offer?\\" But Dawkins fails to mention that God never approved of any of this. The same goes for Abraham who prepares to sacrifice his son, Isaac. (\\"A last minute change of plan? God was only joking...\\") Willingness to obey, to trust, to commit to an absolute God who is ultimately good and just and gave plenty of gracious forewarnings, seems beyond Dawkins ability to conceive. So is divine forgiveness. Atonement (ie the Christ story) is \\"barking mad, vicious, sado-masochistic and repellant.\\" It is interesting that he regards the moral character of Jesus to be admirable (though Christ, he deems, is fictional), yet he is unable to grasp the need for a divine accounting and forgiveness before a divine God. Redemption should not have been necessary (ie Calvary), thinks Dawkins. \\"If God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them?\\" What does Dawkins desire, an auto-God who forgets all, forgives all? Such a God, who never allowed evil to exist or things to go wrong, would never allow free will and choice either. We would all be automatons, incapable of doing wrong - clearly not the case with humanity. But once again, the professor who admits he's not a theist would just erase all semblances of religious logic from the debate.    Yet, fearfully aware of that paradox of infinite regress and a beginning which is ever scientifically inexplicable, Dawkins moans out his atheist plea. \\"The whole argument turns on the familiar question: Who Made God, which most thinking people discover for themselves. A designer God cannot be used to explain organized complexity because any God capable of designing anything would have to be complex enough to demand the same kind of explanation in his own right. God presents an infinite regress from which he cannot help us to escape.\\" Cannot help us to escape? Is it not the very reason that we cannot scientifically explain that infinite regress, Mr Dawkins, that it is only God who can be the originator of it, and be himself beyond it? British literary critic Terry Eagleton was quite right in saying that Dawkins exhibits \\"astounding ignorance ... about what he's talking about\\". Eagleton says \\"for deeply intelligent men Dawkins (and Christopher Hitchens) have a crude, childlike caricature of religion that would make any first-year theology student wince.\\" For a university graduate and an accomplished biologist, you have to wonder why Dawkins pursues the ideas in this book beyond the first chapter. Even in his argument, The Dawkins Confession, writer Alvin Plantinga clearly illustrates the  convolutions of this Dawkinesque non-reasoning, that disproving the material basis of religion does not disprove the other reasons for it.    Yet Dawkins rants on. Elevating himself above the mainstream of believers, we find him mouthing the likes of \\"All I am establishing is that modern morality, wherever else it comes from, does not come from the Bible. Apologists cannot get away with claiming that religion provides them with some sort of inside track to defining what is good and what is bad - a privileged source unavailable to atheists.\\" This is a truly ignorant statement when you consider that apologists do not make any such claim. Biblical apologists in fact maintain that the moral nature we have from God is available to everyone and is implanted within every person. There are no privileged sources for morality. Just the same, Dawkins then tries to demolish this `inside track' by claiming \\"the holy books do not supply any rules for distinguishing the good principles from the bad.\\" Had he simply looked inthe Bible's New Testament a little further, he would have discovered the phrases of \\"blessed are the pure, the meek, the merciful, the peacemakers...\\", for surely in the sermon on the mount we have the golden code of moral behavior. Even if New Testament verses were cherry-picked throughout, it is difficult not to see moral instruction and the rules for it. But Dawkins would rather we are pointed toward a set of New Ten Commandments (for atheists) which strangely are similar to the old ones. Ironically, while he would subscribe to these (ie, \\"Always respect the right of others to disagree with you\\" and \\"Treat your fellow human beings...with love, honesty, faithfulness and respect) he taunts the believer in God with his own insulting belief that \\"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.\\" By this, he means respect?    Dawkins is certainly at his most vain and ignorant when he tries to foist the idea upon the reader (who is smarter than he gives her/him credit for) that a world of atheism would be the utopia we all need. After sharpening his teeth on the monstrous acts of the Stalins and Hitlers of history and presenting them as Christians (in spite of their ungodly nature!), he makes still another astounding claim: \\"I cannot think of any war that has been fought in the name of atheism. Why should it?\\" While Dawkins does not disown the idea of atheistic warfare, he is trying to disown the atheistic reason for them. It is so convenient here for him to forget the wars of communism everywhere, such as Russia, Cuba, Cambodia, Columbia, and China. Millions were slaughtered for simply having religious beliefs in any sort of gods. Even as he wrote this, Dawkins surely wasaware of the atheist war against the Falun Gong of China. Communistic warfare is atheistic in its very purpose, and answers the very question Dawkins asks when he whimpers \\"By contrast, why would anyone go to war for the sake of an absence of belief?\\" The mind cries out: to stop religious wars, Dawkins, and to stop religion.

1609611543|4.0|As someone who suffers from wheat allergies, I love this book.  Some people may find it a little dry as it goes into a lot of detail about what wheat can do to your body.  If you enjoy that type of thing, then it is a great read, but I know that not everyone has the patience to go through that much detail.  The only reason that I took away one star is that I would have liked to have less technical detail and more practical on how to manage a wheat free lifestyle.  It does have some good recipes in the book, but relatively few.  I would have loved to have seen some quick meal ideas etc.  All in all, however, I think it is one of the best books available on a very important topic.

You get to see just how strong and capable Ana really is because let me tell you Christian's past really pushes her to the limit. We also get to see a side of Christian we've never seen before. He allows himself to be vulnerable.  I had tears in my eyes when he went thermalnuclear Fifty.  2.  Lots and lots (did I say lots?) of steamy love. 3.  Mrs. R, Mrs. R......If you are like me and was hoping someone would slap that woman you will get your wish however it won't be by who you think.  It's still very very satisfying.    It's not often I read a book and find myself thinking the sequel was even better than the original but in this case I do.  I love love love it!

This film should be viewed with the lights off and  at the stroke of midnight!!. This will give the viewer a better feel of the events which are about to take place. And as for the cover listing, I'll still take the Exorcist as the most terrifying horror film made, indeed. Long live Regan McNeil!!!.We love you!.

1442419814|5.0|Uglies &iexcl;V Scott Westerfeld<br /><br />(Uglies Trilogy #1)<br /><br />I judged this book by its cover. The older one, that is. It just looked so wickedly awesome, that I thought, it must be a wonderful read! However, although I was right, the book was nothing like I thought it would be. The language of the future world was at times annoying, such as the term Uglies, Pretties, and yuck, Littlies. Or even worse, Rusties. Yet, the language slowly grew on me, and I accepted it. Perhaps it was just my &iexcl;§Rusty&iexcl;¨ (those from the past. You know, those of us who chop down trees and are hideously ugly?) ways getting the best of me. I should be open to new slang. After all &iexcl;§cool&iexcl;¨ loses its desired effect after some time. Bubbly is so much better; and that&iexcl;¦s what this book is, totally bubbly! In other words, it rocks and it really makes you think.<br />  In the society we inhabit now, looks are pretty much a major thing. Even if you don&iexcl;¦t want to admit it, there&iexcl;¦s been at least one time someone made you feel ugly. Or at least, not as pretty as you thought you were. Or maybe you just know you&iexcl;¦re ugly, because you&iexcl;¦re not as skinny as the girls on magazines or even the &iexcl;§normal&iexcl;¨ girls at school. You wear size 14 or even larger, your skin is bumpy, and you&iexcl;¦re eyebrows are uneven. After all, even proportions are important. In fact, most people in society we consider &iexcl;§pretty&iexcl;¨ or &iexcl;§handsome&iexcl;¨ are very well off symmetrically. (I learned that when I studied aesthetics in Philosophy! º ) Scott Westerfeld acknowledges this fact, and its one of the main components of being a Pretty.<br />  The society in Uglies is almost unbelievable, but when you look at how much we focus on looks&iexcl;Keven airbrushing models and celebrities when they already appear perfect to us. Perfection is what most strive for. I currently struggle with self-image difficulties, and I can&iexcl;¦t name a single friend who can honestly say they are perfectly happy with how they look ALL THE TIME. Plastic surgery is a must for some, but what if it became a law? What if at the age of sixteen, you had to have a surgery or sorts to change your whole body, so you will be perfectly beautiful?<br /> The idea may seem a relief, but while you&iexcl;¦re waiting to become Pretty, you&iexcl;¦re stuck with other Uglies. You lose your friends who are older than you. Pretties don&iexcl;¦t associate with Uglies after all. Uglies are hideous freaks.  If you&iexcl;¦re the kind of person who respects you&iexcl;¦re freedom of choice, you probably don&iexcl;¦t like this idea at all. Well, there are people like that in Uglies.

B005974CNA|5.0|Well it's a beautiful morning of September 13th,2011. An exciting day for fans of Progressive music.<br />Yes today is the day when the most anticipated album of Dream Theater \\"A Dramatic Turn Of Events\\" has come out into the stores world wide. I just bought my digital copy of the record last night and now I shall share with you my experience of listening to this record but before I delve in to that,here is a little history of the band and how this album came about. This album is the first one without the architect and co-founder of Dream Theater,drummer Mike Portnoy.For those of you who don't know this,Mike Portnoy left the band on September 8th 2010. His main reason to leave the band was to take a break from the Dream Theater engine because Portnoy was not just their drummer but was also the band's co-producer,co-lyricist,<br />backing vocalist,set list maker,bootlegs and DVDs director,and he also ran the fan club of the band. In fact Mike Portnoy's father came up with the name for this band and Portnoy was the most active member of this band in terms of interacting with the fans and doing all sorts of interesting stuff during his time in Dream Theater. The band did not come to terms with his decision for a hiatus from the band and chose to continue their journey without him. 25 years plus in to their career  Dream Theater had to reinvent  themselves and re figure out the role of each band member with the loss of an integral part of this band.<br /><br /> An audition process for a new drummer took place,which later turned into a documentary. 7 world class drummers were invited for the auditions,which included Mike Mangini,Derek Roddy,Thomas Lang,Virgil Donati,Marco Minnemann,Peter Wildoer,and Aquelies Priester. Finally after the entire audition process Mike Mangini was chosen to continue Mike Portnoy's legacy. Mike Mangini is famously known for playing with artists such as Extreme,Annihilator,and Steve Vai. Mike Mangini was also teaching at the \\"Berklee College OfMusic\\" in Boston before he got his position as a drummer in Dream Theater. Things were quiet different now in the Dream Theater world and this album could have gone in either a bad direction or a really good one. So did this album really stand the test of time for a huge Dream Theater and Mike Portnoy fan,such as myself? Let's get into it track by track.<br /><br /> 1.On The Backs Of Angles (8:43)- Well this track actually came out as a single on YouTube a few months back. My first impression of this track wasn't very satisfactory. Don't get me wrong ;it's a fantastic track but I actually had to give it many listens to finally appreciate it. This sort of process of listening never happened previously with any of Dream Theater's track so I didn't have a very positive vibe of the record as a whole because this was the first piece of music they were exposing from the new record. Now the main problem with this track was actually the mixing. The drums on the YouTube release were quiet low;even though I am a guitarist I noticed that instantly. I listen to every instrument while listening to my music and in a band the drums are the strong foundation. Now I have the album and the drums are a lot more audible.This is a great track,it's got a very catchy chorus to it. The song is about the corrupt elites and all those people that use power for the wrong reasons and wear a mask of being good and pure,yet they aren't. I think the lyrical concept is fantastic.The intro starts off with open and clean chords going into a keyboard melody,and then a whole dramatic entrance of the bass and drums. The first thing that really struck me was how this track has immense similarities with \\"Pull Me Under\\" from \\"Images And Words\\". Not in terms of notes or orchestration but in the sense of its arrangement. Even the time frame is pretty much the same as \\"Pull Me Under\\". As a whole it's a good song but certainly not my favorite from the record. I think for a single this track works great and Ican see why Dream Theater released this as their first single. Even though the drums are quiet audible I still would say they should be a little louder in the mix.<br /><br />2.Build Me Up,Break Me Down(6:59)-This track is really interesting! A new idea of using electronic synths and drum patches was finally introduced in Dream Theater which would get the listener to really put his/her attention into the song. The track is heavy but very well balanced. This could have also been introduced as a single in my opinion. The track has an attractive hook and a really catchy chorus and verse. The track speaks about people that you know would put someone on a really high pedestal but quiet easily degrade them when needed,for their own selfish reasons. The track speaks about how people generally enjoy someone else's misery. This behavior is very common in the society today. You first give someone importance but then you degrade them to the point where they are extremely hurt. The title describes it all -James Labrie's vocals are very powerful on this track. The section where Labrie sings \\"You build me up,you break me down.Until I fall into pieces\\",really would hit the listener hard. It has this effect that would make you feel the pain of someone who is in misery and is being laughed upon. The guitar and keyboard unison is not a shred fest,it's more like a very melodic and musical section. I think this is a unique track with interesting synth sounds,heavy 7 string guitars,strong lyrics,and catchy verses and choruses. If any of you have heard James Labrie's solo albums,then you would certainly enjoy this track. It's in the lines of that material but with a Dream Theater stamp on it.<br /><br />3.Lost Not Forgotten(10:12)-Now this is one of my favorite tracks on the record. It's got that signature Dream Theater sound that I fell in love with years ago. This song would take you back into history if you listen to it with a good amount of concentration. The track describes the history of the Persians,how they were such a strong and powerful force many years ago. They have been lost for a while now but their legacy is not forgotten. I think Dream Theater did an exceptional job on this track describing the glory of the Persians. Right after the second track you would hear the winds of the desert and horses charging with speed towards something. You can easily tell it's on the Persians and their mastery of being exceptional warriors. The track starts off with a beautiful piano intro,which I remember Jordan Rudess playing after the track was recorded. The new added intro is in the style of pianist and composer Schopan. Rudess being a master of the piano and keyboards displays his chops with extreme control and beauty. The listener's ears are bound to be hooked to this track from the very beginning. When the guitars,drums,and bass enter this track it will give a feeling of surprise and amazement to the listener. If I had to describe this track to a Dream Theater fan then I would say this is the 21st century version of \\"Under A Glass Moon\\". Again I am not saying the notes are like that but the arrangement very much is. The guitar intro riff,the build up,the verses,and choruses,the bridge and all. In terms of arrangement it speaks\\"Under A Glass Moon\\" to me. The unison of the keyboard and guitar on this track is probably the most melodic and technical thing John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess have done. John Myung sounds extremely groovy on this track. Mike Mangini is totally locked in to the groove. The part at 3:56 is insanely good going into another section of awesomeness at 4:22. Those ideas and riffs starting at 4:27 are just epic. They would totally give you the vibe of \\"Fatal Tragedy\\",and \\"The Dance Of Eternity\\". Some of the most intricate and mind boggling parts are played on this track. The vocal melody at 4:52 is beautiful; James Labrie is really shining on this track as well. A beautiful guitar melody playing at the back supporting Labrie's vocals really gives this track an amazing effect. While the track is heavy,it has so many amazing melodic break downs. The balance of technical musicianship and heavy and melodic parts displayed on this track are just world class. The riff starting at 6:22 is such a fun riff to listen to,it is building right in to an epic guitar solo by John Petrucci. A lot of people say Petrucci's most unique solo is on \\"Under A Glass Moon\\" from 1992's \\"Images And Words\\";well they are in for a treat. John has finally found the Nemesis of that guitar solo in this solo. So beautiful,unique,intricate,technical,and melodic. Probably one of the best guitar solos on this album. The change of progressions at 8:07 is so perfect! The timing,the usage of techniques,the choice of notes are just golden. From there it builds right into Jordan Rudess's solo,which is probably some of the best stuff I heard from Rudess in a very long time. 8:22 the epic factor of keyboards begins! It's so well thought out and is not just fast but it was well thought out. 8:52 marks the beginning of a chaotic idea going into the chorus of the track. Mangini showing his technique at 9:23. He seriously has some phenomenal movement in his limbs. 9:46 it goes back to the intro riff,which marks the ending of this progressive epic. This track is a real treat for all true Dream Theater fans.<br /><br />4.This Is The Life(6:58)- Many would agree on this that Dream Theater's classic ballad has been \\"Another Day\\". Well I believe finally we have a modern age \\"Another Day\\" in front of us. \\"This Is The Life\\" talks about a very common yet deep topic. People of today don't look at the life that they are blessed with,rather they would look at everybody else's than dwell on their own life. It gives a beautiful message to appreciate the life that you have been given. So many people in this world don't have a life like ours,imagine those folks that don't even have a roof on top of their heads,or a loaf of bread to get through the day.Many of you reading this review have a computer,a home,three meals daily,a phone,car,an education,and all the basic yet integral amenities of life. Yet a lot of you would not dwell on your life and look at someone else's,which might be the life you want. But look at it from a suffering person's eye and you'll notice how blessed you are. Look around you and see the blessings that have been bestowed upon you. This is what this beautiful track describes. It starts with an epic clean chord progression just like in \\"Another Day\\" going in to a beautiful lead guitar line,topped with bass,and drums. James Labrie's voice on this is just outstanding,it's like he is singing right into your ears with extreme sweetness. John Petrucci's lead guitar melody at 1:44 is a true example of his beautiful feel of the instrument. The drums on this track remind me of the drums on \\"Damnation\\" by the band Opeth. It has the sweet and heart warming groove to it topped with balanced and well thought out bass lines. At 2:02 Jordan Rudess comes out with a soaring keyboard line and the patch/effect he is using is also a very fresh one.Rudess's patch  gives this track a totally new feel and sets it apart from all the other Dream Theater ballads. If I had to describe this track as a whole,then it would be a merger between \\"Yes\\" and \\"Marillion\\", with a sprinkle of the softer side of \\"Opeth\\". At 4:23 John Petrucci comes in with an absolutely melodic and beautiful solo. It's really warm and would touch the heart of the listener.At 5:50 the track becomes really cinematic.An absolutely beautiful ballad with beautiful melodies,musicianship,vocals,and lyrics. Certainly a very dramatic track which would leave the listener in a state of deep thought. I think it has a very strong and positive message for everyone all around the world.<br /><br />5.Bridges In The Sky(11:01)-Wow this track has such a unique and ethnic introduction.Jordan Rudess gave it an awesome start with these epic voice samples portraying the shaman and some really cool synth patches. This song describes the experience of being a Shaman in a temple. It's kind of a religious experience in many ways. The track was initially called \\"The Shaman's Trance\\" but then the name changed to what it is now. Indeed if you listen to this track while being in the zone you'll feel a trance and surge of energy. It's such a moving experience in all honesty. At 1:36 the guitars and drums kick in and then everything else enters. If you love epic 7 string guitar riffs then this track is for you. Absolutely heavy and in your face. The mapping/arrangement of this entire song reminds me of \\"Take The Time\\". None of the notes are similar but the mapping of the chart for this track is pretty much the same. The track has the heavy vibe of Dream Theater's classic,\\"The Glass Prison\\". At 2:14 you'll find the interesting ideas of the band,which are a signature to their sound. 2:55 James Labrie comes in and his vocals are just tantalizing. While this track is a perfect example of a Dream Theater Progressive Metal epic,it has these beautiful melodies at the same time. A good example is the melodic change that takes place on the section at 3:53. Dream Theater have proven to keep a perfect balance between the melodic aspects and the heaviness of the song. Balance is a good thing and this effort is certainly worthy of applause. John Myung is just grooving on this track,the man isn't one of the best bassists in the world just like that. 4:58 has this really cool section of bass,guitars,and drums. The part is intricate and moving,and Jordan Rudess adds his haunting keyboard parts there as well. I really love the flow of this track,all the key changes are so smooth and flowing. A good example is the change that takes place at 7:08. The unison section between Petrucci's guitar and Myung's bass is a perfect example of what I am talking about. At 7:14,another really cool change that felt effortless,it is  really a beautiful section. 7:38 the beautiful unison amongst all the instruments is just beautiful. Has the whole ethnic Arabic music vibe to it.At 7:55 John Petrucci plays a very cool solo,fans of \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" would certainly enjoy it. At 8:19 Jordan comes in with a very cool keyboard idea and it sounds like something from \\"Awake\\",going in to a very cool \\"Train Of Thought\\" type of movement.Then Labrie comes back with his vocals setting the perfect mood for the track to end. I absolutely love this track. The track ends with an absolute bang! Dark melodic,and heavy is my cup of tea certainly.<br /><br />6.Outcry(11:24)-This probably is the most technical track on the album. The beauty about this track is that while it's technical it doesn't throw you off. Every part and section on this song is well thought out. It stands head to head with all of Dream Theater's technical progressive anthems. I found the arrangement to be quiet similar to \\"Metropolis Part1\\". The intro with a keyboard,going in to an epic guitar riff. This is more of a modern version in terms of orchestration and choice of notes. The electronic sounds in a Dream Theater setting sound really good. The beautiful guitar riff at 0:45 is just going to put a smile on your face. The keyboards,bass,and drums supporting it give it a very strong and dramatic effect. 1:31 shows some really cool electronic sounds being used,the bass is very prominent on this track. James sounds really strong on this track as well.his performance has been virile throughout. I love how he is using his midrange mostly on this album; it displays his beautiful timbre quiet well. The song has beautiful lyrics,which talk about corrupt societies,governments,agendas,and the cruelty that mankind is facing. The message of this song is to take a stand against such groups that cause so much unrest all around the world. 4:50 the instrumental beauty beings. Jordan Rudess really plays some amazing notes out here. 5:17 Mangini plays some really cool drum parts. Allinstruments in unison sound epic and beautiful. I think this section is like a unison between the instrumental section of Metropolis Pt.1 and Octavarium. 6:16  has this phenomenal keyboard and piano section that lasts till 6:37. If you miss the \\"Six Degrees Of Inner turbulence\\" Keyboard sound,then look no further it's very much back. 6:58 displays the instrumental intricacy between John Myung and Mike Mangini.7:21 Petrucci comes in with a beautiful soaring lead that really sets the bar really high.Another big change takes place at 7:43,and wow, to my delight, this is one of the most amazing progressive instrumental sections I have heard in a long time. Mangini does some  interesting stuff at around 8:30 and then a beautiful clean piano part at 8:44 sets the mood back in for Labrie's vocals.9:08 displays a beautiful melody over all. This is definitely the most progressive and technical track on the album. A strong song in terms of technicality,musicianship,and lyrical content.<br /><br />7.Far From Heaven(3:56)-I call this the modern version of \\"Wait For Sleep\\"in terms of the mapping of the song. Jordan Rudess showing his beautiful melodic musicianship on the keys and piano. James Labrie's voice calm and warm,he really sets the mood of this song and beautifully represents the lyrics he wrote for this track. All the string sounds are being played via the keyboard during the same time as the piano parts. This is just an absolutely beautiful collaboration between Jordan Rudess and James Labrie. The lyrics are beautiful,they are based on people that just at times do so much to be understood or accepted but they are never understood. A good example is how parents want their kids to just get really good grades at everything.They may not be even interested or be good at certain subjects but the parents have exceptionally high expectations,without thinking what's good for their child. It keeps them away from the sense of acceptance,security,and encouragement. Basically theyare far away from that feeling of joy,comfort,and acceptance. So they are basically far from heaven. The track beautifully  describes such situations. I just gave an example of parents and kids but this track can be used in any situation or relationship. Basically it's a beautiful message and plea to accept someone as they truly are and to basically understand them,for their own good in the future.<br /><br />8.Breaking All Illusions(12:26)-This track is a continuation of \\"Fram From From Heaven\\" and the final Progressive epic of this album. It's also a very special track because it's been written by John Myung the bassist of the band. The last time Myung wrote a song was on 1999's \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" called \\"Fatal Tragedy\\". If you listen to this track carefully you will actually realize that it is a modern version of \\"Learning To Live\\" that John Myung wrote in 1992's \\"Images And Words\\". The mapping/arrangement of the song is pretty much the same. The song is about how people have preconceived notions about a situation or a person and they are under the illusion of something that's not really there. It describes beautifully on how to break stereotypes,fads,and the general perception that people have about something. It's all about breaking the illusion and showing reality,or the other side to a stereotype.Learning to live starts off with keyboards,so does this track,then the drums enter,then the guitars,and bass. 0:33 has a beautiful idea displayed,the melody of this track is full of surreal harmonic quality. There is a lot of cool instrumental interaction until 1:35. Then John Myung's bass lines are heard and the piano enters at 1:45. At 2:04 James Labrie comes in with his harmonious voice and there is a key change. If you listen to \\"Learning To Live\\",you'll find a very similar thing going on in there. 2:43 Petrucci plays a beautiful guitar lead melody with Labrie's warm vocal melody. The verse of this track is really emotional,the words are perfectly fitting the melodic content of the track. 3:41-an amazing instrumental section is presented.4:22 presents a beautiful key change,representing the original key again. That beautiful section where Jordan shines leads us in to one of the most beautiful choruses Dream Theater wrote. At 5:00 there is another epic instrumental section,where Jordan is using a totally new sample on his keyboard. The clean glossy guitar sound combined with Rudesse's new patch gives a really amazing vibe to the listener. When I heard it at first it sounded something that the band \\"Scale The Summit\\" would do. 5:10-6:08 the unison between the guitar,bass,keyboards,and drums is just platinum. I love Mike Mangini's drum patterns on there! On this track Mike Mangini really shines in his performance. Finally at 6:09 another epic change in melody takes place. It's like Dream Theater really thought about their music on this record. The movements are phenomenal to say the least. John Petrucci playing a beautiful guitar lead section starting at 6:09 and ending at 6:39. 6:41 those chord progressions are probably some of my favorites that Dream Theater have done,the percussion at the back,and Jordan's Piano give it a dramatic effect.There are also these interesting electronic samples being played at the back while all this is going on. Yet it doesn't seem like any part is overshadowing another part. It all seems to be gelled perfectly. At 7:12 Petrucci plays one of the most heart felt solos . I was really missing that fusion based sound of John Petrucci;he has certainly brought it back on here. I can seriously say that the solo on this track is one of my favorites for sure.8:10 all the instruments come in as John is soling,the effect is just beautiful! I believe this is also the longest guitar solo on the album. 8:51 another amazing key change takes place. John Myung playing the perfect notes at the perfect time. The drums and keyboards come in as well and there is some dark phrygian based type of interplay goingon amongst Petrucci,Rudess,and Myung;while Mangini keeps the groove strong and firm. This section reminds me  of Dream Theater's track \\"Home\\" from \\"Scenes From A Memory\\". the  build of the riff from 9:07 till 10:36 is just phenomenal. There is so much interaction between the musicians that I can't just write it in words. You just have to actually sit and listen to it by yourself,to appreciate the beauty of the instrumentation. 11:01 another beautiful movement is presented which leads to the end of this beautiful progressive epic.<br /><br />9.Beneath The Surface(5:27)-The final track on the album begins with water drops falling down. You can tell this is a beautiful ending track,as soon as the guitar comes in. John Petrucci has penned most of the lyrics on this record,including this one and it's just beautiful. This is an absolute cool down,it's something you can listen to with your eyes closed and just sit back.This song was initially not going to be on the album. Petrucci came up with it on his own,after the completion of the writing process. It's got these beautiful guitar chordal sections,background strings,and keyboards. James Labrie is singing it beautifully once again.I haven't liked Labrie's performance this much since \\"Scenes From A Memory\\". He is in total shape and form.The highlight of this track is Jordan Rudess's synth effect at 3:20;it's just beautiful. An absolutely phenomenal and moving solo. The song describes a common yet interesting situation. It's like when you care for someone so much and they are just indifferent to your feelings. Then there comes a point where you need to pour out your frustrations about it to somebody but you look around yourself and there is no one. Eventually it comes to a point that you don't know what will happen,you want to scream,you want someone to hear what you have to say,and you certainly want that person who you care for to care about how you feel. Eventually all this turns in to pain and then you just bury it deepinside yourself,to the point where you don't even think about it. The song describes how a caring person can transform into a person that is indifferent to their surroundings. A great album closer in my opinion.<br /><br /> To conclude this album I would simply like to say a few things.<br /> 1.This album certainly stood the test of time.<br />2.It's some of the best stuff Dream Theater have created in the past 10 years.<br />3.I don't know if Dream Theater would ever come out and reveal this,but I certainly feel they revisited their classic album \\"Images And Words\\". Now that does not mean they copied it,no not at all. But you know how arrangements of tracks are outlined right. Like pop songs for example have a certain common outline or road map to them. Well I truly believe Dream Theater used their Images And Words charts to create some phenomenal piece of music. There is nothing wrong with what they did. They clearly knew what they were doing and they wanted to make a very strong come back with a modern and refreshing approach to the legendary Dream Theater style.<br />4.Initially the mix didn't appeal to me but then I heard the record on my JBL Studio Monitors and I could totally see where the mix was going.Andy Wallace did a phenomenal job on the mix,although I wouldn't have minded if the drums were higher up a notch.The balance of each instrument was captured beautifully.<br />5.I think over all John Petrucci did a great job in the production of this album. For the first time without Mike Portnoy,Petrucci managed to work the entire production himself with finess.<br />6.About eight or nine years ago a Dutch magazine \\"Aardschock\\" did an interview with Mike Portnoy and asked him who he would see as a proper replacement for himself in Dream Theater.Mike Portnoy said it would be Mike Mangini.<br /><br />In conclusion to me this record is the 21st century Images And Words. In fact A/B this album with Images And Words and notice the similarities in the  arrangements. The timing of the album however interestingly clocks around the same time as \\"Scenes From A Memory\\".<br />Scenes From A Memory Metropolis pt. 2 length 77:12.<br />A Dramatic Turn of Events length 77:05.<br /><br /> Both these records are revolutionary albums for Dream Theater,so it's really interesting how they sort of took such a concept for this new record,as it's also a big move in their career.<br /><br />Facts about these 3 albums:<br />1.Images And Words-The album that set the strong empire for Dream Theater and also introduced James Labrie as their new vocalist.<br />2.Scenes From A Memory Metropolis pt. 2- The resurrection of Dream Theater. One of the greatest concept albums of all time,and Jordan Rudess becomes their new keyboardist/pianist.<br />3.A Dramatic Turn Of Events-One of their most anticipated albums in a long time. Mike Mangini becomes the new drummer for Dream Theater.<br /><br /> My rating for this album is a straight 10/10.<br /> Written By:<br />Aman Hassan.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is the best quality Star Wars to date, so why not buy the Star Wars complete saga on blu-ray?  If you own an HDTV and also own a blu-ray player you would be stupid to not also own Star Wars on blu-ray if you are a fan of Star Wars.  Just because there are changes from the original version of Star Wars does not mean you should not buy this version of blur-ray.  It is still Star Wars despite the minuscule changes.  I hope George Lucas decides to be like Disney and just release it on blu-ray for a limited time just despite those of you who decide to not get this on blu-ray so you can wallow in your self-defeat that you did not buy this version.  Your HDTV means nothing now because you did not buy Star Wars on blu-ray.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Fans of Star Wars, and more importantly parents of fans of Star Wars:<br /><br />You must listen to what they've done to the original movies and boycott this particular release. They have made so many terrible changes to the originals that they no longer have the magic they once did. If no one buys it, they will redo it. Stop being a mindless consumer and for once make the manufacturer deliver what we want to buy, rather than what they want to sell.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I compared Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG - $39 bucks and bought this one. I bought this one not because it is 5 bucks cheaper, rather based on reviews and my gut feeling this one is better than the Canon's. I am not disappointed.<br /><br />Most of the amazon basics are great products. The OEMs are rip-off.<br /><br />This bag is spacious, accommodates all my lenses, batt charger, cables, card reader etc. There is a plenty of space for everything for an average user. Good padding too.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My son absolutely LOVES this movie! He's 5, and we have a Blue & Gold Macaw so he knows a little bit about the birds going into watching this.  He wouldn't let me return the rental until this one showed up in the mailbox, the digital copy is a must- makes it much easier to have it in anyroom we go or to load it up on the ipod to take with us.  It's well done with a good mix of humor for the whole family and it does shed some light on the illegal trafficking of these beautiful animals without darkening the film for the little ones.  I'll be buying the soundtrack next for him to listen to in the truck.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|As for cooling, this heat sink easily drops my CPU temperature by at least 5C while my CPU is at idle. I can't give exact numbers since I bought a new CPU with this heat sink.    Setting up, is a bit of a pain. You have to have access to the other side of the motherboard to install the anchor. This annoyance could be avoided if you are buying this with a new motherboard so you have access to the bottom of your mobo anyways, or if your case opens on both sides.    Noise.. the fan it comes with is pretty loud to be honest. It won't wake me up at night or anything but it's loud enough to be annoying, for me personally because my rig was very quiet beforehand and this fan increased my rig's noise by at least double. If you don't care too much about noise, then I wouldn't worry about the fan too much, but if you are worried about noise (like me) you can always just by a new, quieter fan. I will because of 2 reasons: 1) cause of noise and 2)..    Because this heat sink is MASSIVE. When I close my case, there's probably at most half an inch leeway before touching the side panel. But what's the WORST is that it WILL BLOCK ONE OF YOUR RAM SLOTS. I was hoping my mobo is big enough, but NO. IT FORCES ME TO NOT USE MY #1 SLOT. Good thing I only have 2 sticks of ram so I can just use slot #2 and #4. ALTHOUGH, this could be fixed if you get a new fan that is a \\"slim\\" fan. I'll probably end up doing that anyways cause of the fan it comes with is loud, and also to leave the option open if I ever want to by 2 more sticks of ram.    All in all, good product, but beware of size. Any medium sized tower should fit this massive heat sink.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Just as effective as the 1972 original, yet for vastly different reasons, Steven Soderbergh's triumphant sci-fi masterpiece is an intellectually stimulating look at loneliness, love and eventual madness.  The film is stunning to look at, with each set piece moving in such stimulating manners; and the film itself has such a ferocious fluidity that completely takes you over.  It is hypnotic in a way, shifting rather effortlessly from present day moments to flashback sequences.  The film, in a more modern sense, is far more visually captivating than the original film (both films are adapted from the novel written by Stanislaw Lem, so it would be inaccurate to say that this 2002 film is a remake of Tarkovsky's '72 masterpiece).  Both films, while constructively different, are marvelous cinematic feats.  I think that, overall, Tarkovsky's film makes the strongest statement (and it remains haunting regardless of how many times I watch it), but that is no discredit to the work that Soderbergh does with this underrated classic.<br /><br />Why isn't this loved deeply by all?<br /><br />Chris Kelvin is a psychologist sent to a space station orbiting an alien planet.  That particular station has stopped all communications, and Kelvin is sent to investigate why.  When Kelvin arrives he is quickly absorbed into the manipulated atmosphere created by the glowing orb lingering outside the space station.  Infiltrating his inner desires, this planet projects Kelvin's deceased wife.  Kelvin's rationality initially rejects this reincarnation but with persistence this planet is able to get inside his head, where he wholly accepts this woman as the root of all happiness.<br /><br />Soderbergh's interpretation of the source material is vastly different than Tarkovsky's.  Apparently, neither director appeased the novel's author, who was vocally opposed to both film adaptations.  Where Tarkovsky projected a coldness that seemed to highlight the story's more intellectual side, Soderbergh plays to the romantic, creating a more warm and embracive texture with the film.  The film is a visual marvel, and Soderbergh uses that element with such finesse.<br /><br />The performances here are all top notch.  Clooney really sinks into the role, and while his character can at moments feel more observational than anything else (like a mere canvas for those around him to paint), he grounds his performance in a `felt' emotional resistance.  Viola Davis is extraordinary here, finding a solemn depth of character that lives in the small moments.  Jeremy Davies provides small splashes of humor that break up the film's consistent tension, and Natascha McElhone uses more than just her stunning looks to captivate the audience (and Clooney).<br /><br />I can understand why some are put off by this film; for it is not the most accessible feature film.  Honestly though, this is a stunning piece of work, and it serves as a complimentary piece to Tarkovsky's version because they tell two sides of the same story, or two variations, so that we can get a fuller picture, which in the end may be exactly what Stanislaw Lem would have wished us to see.ys to the romantic, creating a more warm and embracive texture with the film.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|Love this movie.  This is like watching Jane Austen movies in the eye of the modern viewers. Captured most of the thought we had when we read Pride and Prejudice. I fallen in love with the characters and my mr. Darcy here.  I wish I can see more version of Jane Austen movies like this. *2 thumps up*
B00005JL96|2.0|There is a spunk within `Lilo and Stitch' that is undeniable.  It is semi-charming.  On the other hand, there is a spunk within `Lilo and Stitch' that is also semi-annoying.  Yes, the film is rather uneven and in that vein almost unwatchable.  It just becomes something un-enjoyable.  I know that I'm totally in the minority here (I reside there, so it doesn't really bother me) but I just couldn't choke this film down completely.  I will say that there were moments that struck me, but they weren't enough to validate actually liking this movie.  Some have noted that the films premise is original, which I find kind of baffling since the actual plot formula is the same ol' same really.  I will also say that I was really disappointed the first time I saw this film, considering the fact that the advertisements were atrociously misleading.  I vividly remember countless teaser trailers showing Stitch's character invading other Disney films and the idea of a rogue character causing chaos within Disney's classics such as `Beauty and the Beast' really struck me as fun and original.  That doesn't happen ONCE in this movie.  Shrugging aside my initial annoyance, I decided to see the film a second time and judge it solely on what the film was and not what I thought it was going to be.  I still didn't really like it.  The film is wildly uneven, with conflicting moments of tender and sincere (Lilo and her sister Nani) and force-fed ridiculousness (Stitch).  It's like two films collided and what we were left with is an utter mess.  I quite like the cartoonishy animation, because I feel like it flows with the direction taken on the film (it complements the zany quality here), but the zaniness is the film's biggest flaw and so maybe it wasn't such a good decision after all.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|This movie was a great addition to the ongoing series of Harry Potter movies. It had suspense sprinkled with comedic relief. It was appropriate for children while still keeping the adults entertained. Great movie all around, especially so for families.

B005KH928E|3.0|Had this been an \\"official\\" bootleg recording, I suppose my expectations would have been in synch with this release... Had I been there that night, it might be fun to have a souvenir of the evening.  But this is simply not up to the standards set by both these great musicians.  I dig Dixieland Jazz and Clapton is a master in nearly any genre.  It's not just the poor sound quality, it feels like a rehearsal.  In fact, it feels like the first rehearsal.  I would have loved to have heard this collaboration three nights later, with a much better recording.  This pales in comparison to the wonderful -- rehearsed -- music Clapton made with Dr. John several years back.  Nothing on this recording begins to compare with Clapton and Dr. John's \\"St. James Infirmiry.\\"  Search for that instead.
159514188X|4.0|I was really hesitant about starting this book because I don't really enjoy contemporary YA fiction all that much, but I always like to be involved in the young adult group discussions about the book of the month and Thirteen Reasons Why was the book of the month.  I had heard that it was really sad so I prepared myself for a book that was going to make me cry.<br /><br />Even though Thirteen Reasons Why was a roller coaster of emotions for main characters Hannah and Clay, it didn't make me cry.  Part of the reason is because I knew from the beginning of the book that Hannah had killed herself so it wasn't a surprise that in every chapter Hannah's state of mind became worse and worse.  I did connect with the characters enough that I found myself hoping that Hannah was going to pop up around the corner or from the next room and say, \\"surprise, I really didn't kill myself.\\" But of course, that didn't happen.<br /><br />What really shocked me the most about the book was the guidance counselor character.  As a professional who has worked in the counseling field for a little while now, I know the guidance counselor should have caught on to what was going on with Hannah.  It's a big problem in the public school system with all the budget cuts.  Guidance counselors are expected to take on classes instead of just focusing on the student body and their mental health.  I felt like Hannah went to the guidance counselor knowing that he was too stressed with his classes and grading papers and that he wouldn't see the signs.<br /><br />Towards the end, it just made me so sad to read her going out and finding reasons and people who would take advantage of her.  She needed to prove to herself that no one respected her or that she didn't have any true friends.  And that's exactly what she did.  Thirteen Reasons Why is a very powerful novel that deals with a hard hitting teenage issues (bullying and suicide) that need to be talked about more.

B0034G4P8A|2.0|Let me start by saying I have never read any of the old comics.  I am vaguely aware of who Thor is supposed to be, but I have no previous experience with his story so went into this movie with no expectations other than Marvel's prior movies.  I was hoping for something fun, interesting, and with a few unexpected twists--much like Iron Man, Spiderman, or even the newer Hulk, all of which I did enjoy.  This movie, sadly, was nothing like them.  I was mostly bored, just waiting for something to happen.  There were a few halfway decent special effects (most notably the watcher at the gate, peering out eerily from behind his temporary prison of ice).  But the acting and the characters were completely one dimensional.  The blue villians hardly even had one dimension--they were like cardboard cutouts.  Their planet made no sense, and they seemed to have no purpose other than running out for Thor to beat up.  Loki almost had a little depth, but his story seemed to be half untold.  The highlight of the entire movie, for my family, was spotting Stan Lee in the pickup trying to pull out the hammer from where it fell to earth.  There is a hint of potential for a good story here and there, but it remains largely untold.  :(
B002CGSYNU|5.0|Bought this to replace the lost lens cap for the 14-42 lens on my E-PL1. I lost the first one because it never fit properly (despite it being the cap that shipped with my camera) - it kept falling off while I was walking.    This lens cap seems thicker, and I believe it has a different latching mechanism than my original (but I can't recall exactly how the first one worked). It fits very securely and doesn't need any jiggling to attach. Hasn't fallen off once, and I walk around with my camera on my hip (and the lens extended) a fair amount.    I bought my E-PL1 with the 14-42 kit lens in April of 2010, in case the lens has changed since then (as another reviewer mentioned was possible).

B005COO1X6|2.0|I am a HUGE long time Stephen King fan so, of course, bought this short story without giving it a second though.  Boy, was I disappointed.  The beginning doesn't seem to have anything to do with the rest of the story and the \\"horrific\\" part of it just seems stupid and mindless.  The ending, however, is by far the worst part.  It's abrupt and seems to come completely out of the blue and makes no sense.  I'm so disappointed as I'm thrilled anytime a new King offering comes out.  I hope this isn't a harbinger of things to come.
0920236162|1.0|Here is the synopsis of the story:<br />A smart young princess has her dream of being married to a prince snatched away by a mean old dragon.<br />He burns up her castle, everything she owns and carries off her prince.<br />Picture the Adam and Eve illustrations with the leaves of the tree or growing reeds in just the right spot. That's how this little princess is left standing...except her chest is in full view with the nipples she doesn't have.<br />She finds a paper bag \\"that wasn't burnt\\" and puts it on.<br />The princess is very smart and so tricks the dragon in order to save her prince. He's so ungrateful! \\"You're a mess...Come back and rescue me when you are dressed like a REAL PRINCESS.\\" Not exactly the type of thing I want my 3 year old pondering when I leave her to look at her board books at night. The princess responds just as ugly by insulting him right back,, \\"RONALD...you are a BUM.\\"<br />Besides a rather mature, bratty ending and with an obvious feminist bent the writing is FAR from a classic and more like the style you'd find in a note on the floor of a 3rd grade classroom.<br />I SOOOO Wish the book would have ended with her as the gracious heroine and him a thankful gentleman.
B003VS0CX8|3.0|I was very excited to watch the SOM in blu ray.  Unfortunately the blu ray disc only works on our Sony player which is on our tv.  The Panasonic connected to our theater projector couldn't play it.  I have tried updating firmware but the SOM blu ray says it needs a memory card added to the player?!?  Not sure what that means yet.  I will be trying the recommended website soon.  Hopefully that can resolve the playback problem.  Otherwise it is striking and beautiful on a 46\\" screen.  Yes, I realize we can move the Sony but I'd rather fix the Panasonic to see it at 100+\\".

0345529057|1.0|I held off for a long time to begin reading this series because those that had read the first three books lamented over the fact that the fourth had not been written.  When the fourth book was written (I thought that it would be the final chapter) I started to read the series.  And what a great and terrible series it was, at leas t for the first three books.  Deep character development, and a plot without a clear antagonist/protagonist defined.  Characters had both higher and lower selves, and could be killed off at any time!  I encourage you not to start the series, unless you like being left hanging.  After the fourth and final fifth book, the is no closure to the stories and characters whose presence were there in all the volumes either just get suddenly killed, or you are left wondering why they were ever in the story to begin with.  I'm not kidding here.  I'm not a good reviewer, butbelieve me when I tell you that you will be pissed when you turn the 1500th page of book 5!  DON'T START READING THIS SERIES. I WARNED YOU!

0446556750|3.0|\\"The Reversal,\\" (2010), a courtroom drama/thriller/mystery, was the third entry in the Lincoln Lawyer series by Michael Connelly, one of the greatest of American mystery authors.  Of course Connelly, now a mega-seller in light of the film [[ASIN:B004EPYZP8 The Lincoln Lawyer]], based on the book of the same name, has had many best sellers, principally among his now 16 book series on Los Angeles Police Department Inspector Harry Bosch. Connelly is a former journalist, a crime beat writer for the Los Angeles Times, who certainly earned his spurs in murder while earning his daily bread.<br /><br />The Lincoln Lawyer series, also Los Angeles-set, combines courtroom drama with strong elements of police procedurals. It, too, looks at life on the \\"noir\\"--darker-- side in that city. It centers, as you might suppose, on Mickey Haller, LA defense attorney, who prefers to work in the back seats of his identical Lincoln Town Cars, as whoever of his clients cannot pay their legal fees, drives.  Haller narrates the chapters in which he appears.  THE REVERSAL also gives us Lieutenant Bosch, whom we have learned previously, is Haller's half-brother: the Bosch chapters are narrated in the third person.<br /><br />Mickey is invited by the Los Angeles County District Attorney to take on the prosecution of an upcoming case for his office, so the longtime defense counsel with the high winning average knows something is afoot. As district attorneys, historically, are no fans of his.  But the high-profile case of Jason Jessup, who was convicted of killing the child Melissa Landy many years ago, and has spent almost 25 years on death row before DNA evidence appears to free him, is a special one. The case appears to call out for a special prosecutor.  For the DA is determined to re-charge and re-try Jessup for the same crime, and seems doomed to failure. Mickey takes the case: he likes the challenge, and the likelihood of reams of publicity. He brings Bosch on board as his lead investigator. But as the new trial date nears, Mickey begins to wonder if he isn't expected to fail, with the renewed prosecution merely a tactic to prevent Jessup from successfully suing the state and county for millions of dollars.<br /><br />It should be easy for most readers to care about the fate of the pretty blonde child. But the book lacks the passionate power Connelly can pour into some of his books; see [[ASIN:0446619078 The Last Coyote (Harry Bosch)]], or [[ASIN:0446699535 City of Bones (Harry Bosch)]]. Furthermore, aside from the louche charm Matthew McConaughey brought to the title role in the filmed Lincoln Lawyer, the Haller character, as created by Connelly, just doesn't have much personality: he has a yen for his second ex-wife, assistant district attorney Maggie McPherson, known as Maggie McFierce, whom he taps to work with him as second chair on the case.  And he loves their daughter Hayley.  And unfortunately, Harry Bosch, who drips personality, plays only a supporting role here: he just does what he's gotta do. However, what disappointed me most about THE REVERSAL was its ending.  Of course, we all know, a mystery or thriller must have an ending, and it's probably never easy to dream one up.  But Connelly really seems to have dragged this one in from left field: our perpetrator acts in ways we've been given no reason to expect.<br /><br />Never mind, the book shows the excellent narrative, descriptive, and dialogue writing that are characteristic of Connelly. It too is written with great knowledge of, and love for, Los Angeles. (You could pretty much use his works instead of a road map). And it clearly follows in the footsteps of earlier outstanding hard-boiled Los Angeles authors Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald. Finally, Connelly explicates his love of jazz as he goes.<br /><br />Connelly can write wonderfully, and is my favorite among American mystery authors. Many of the Bosch and Lincoln Lawyer series have been New York Times best sellers, as have many of his standalones. Well, I prefer the Bosch series, but for those multifarious newer readers who perhaps came aboard only with LINCOLN LAWYER, this should be good enough.fer the Bosch series, but for those multifarious newer readers who perhaps came aboard only with LINCOLN LAWYER, this should be good enough.

B0034G4P80|5.0|Admittedly, I'm not nor have I ever been much of a Thor fan. I've seen the character on occasion through different animated features and whatnot(even wrote reviews on a few) but never really cared for the character. Course, after seeing this film, methinks I'm going to change all that.<br /><br />Thor, to me, is the most visually stunning of all the Marvel films I've seen thus far. Much more epic than X-Men: First Class, sorry to say. Whilst(here I go with Thor talk, lol) I won't go so far as to say that Thor is the Summer Blockbuster of 2011, either. I will say it is a dadgum fine film that entertained me completely all the way through. I, especially, loved the more humorous moments in the film. There's some great laugh out loud moments. Yet, what amazed me most about the film was the scope and the acting in the movie....it does star Anthony Hopkins, after all.<br /><br />It's not without it's flaws as with any film but it's an entertaining superhero film.

B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|Review from Melt Magazine - Columbus, OH<br /><br />Wow, where to begin. Firstly, I was really looking forward to hating this album. From the pitched-up, overly enunciated \\"white\\" voice that asks/sings \\"can we get much higher?\\" on the opening track, it seemed like the usual mix of obnoxious self-assurance and musical naivety that has rendered me less than a fan. The video for \\"Power\\" which was released as a promo for the album in May was an interesting enough portrait of Yee's egocentricity, but even the use of King Crimson's \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" in that song came off as simply weird for weird's sake. Appropriating a song from one of the most influential \\"progressive rock\\" albums of all time to symbolize one's own \\"progressiveness\\" in the world of mainstream pop is a move that only the hollowest of human-shaped, money vacuums could pull off. So, when I \\"acquired\\" the album last week, I was expecting to jam on a verse or two and then delete the f___ out of it. That's when things got complicated.<br /><br />At least seven of the top music magazines have given West's manic manifesto PERFECT scores. On the album's release date Pitchfork.com issued an accompanying term paper length philosophical inquiry in place of an album review, that actually made a hell of a lot of sense. The consensus among our time's top purveyors of culture seems to be that it's just too damn hard to argue against Yee's extravagance, thus it is legitimate.<br /><br />Excess is certainly a central theme throughout, both lyrically and in composition/production. The excessive and elite guestlist (Rihanna, Jay-Z, Elton John, Bon Iver, Kid Cudi, RZA, etc.), the over the top lyrics and the sheer scale of the sounds he is using come together in a listening experience not far from seeing a Salvador Dali painting for the first time in the 1930s. The first third of the album leading up to the most accessible track 'All of The Lights' seems sane enough, but by Nicki Minaj's ecstatic, dancehall flow on 'Monster' that sounds crazy enough yet too well written to be on a Die Antwoord track, it is clear that someone has dosed the studio water cooler.  From there, four more tracks break the six minute mark (that's two regular pop songs each, for those of you counting) and fill time between Kanye's most abrasive, offensive and impassioned words to date with long, instrumental/noise zone-out sessions unlike anything heard before, let alone on a hip-hop record.<br /><br />I'm admittedly struggling for an original thought here after reading like twenty LONG reviews of this album but Bjork's last record Volta keeps coming to mind. While certainly more subdued (possibly more enlightened), that album definitely touched on some similar vibes and being produced by Timbaland and all, it had the same musical worlds colliding with an artful (and not corny) outcome. Or maybe it's just the fact that both albums have the same red field for a cover and the horn section parts sound nearly identical. At any rate Kanye's attempt to marry hip-hop and high art is truly something to behold. Fantasy is the most jarring, belittling and all around NOT easy to listen to mainstream pop album that I have ever heard, which like the big boys of the print/web press are spelling out, equates a welcomed wake up. Without doubt, this is one of those love it/hate it situations, or at least a \\"value it's artistic merit\\"/ hate it split. Michael Jackson. Kanye West. Lady Gaga. In that order, for now at least. - Tyler Starkeycrazy enough yet too well written to be on a Die Antwoord track, it is clear that someone has dosed the studio water cooler.

030788743X|5.0|Best novel I've read for 2010 and 2011. While I anticipated the fifth book of the George R.R. Martin series, this little nugget slipped right under the radar. Picked it up from the library, read the first 50 pages, returned it, went out and purchased a copy of it. This book is almost like a Bible for any sort of male or female nerd that grew up during the 1980s and played video games, D&D and listened to metal rock. A MUST read.

B0059R5Q08|4.0|Having read Jane Eyre many times and much of the work about the novel, and being very familiar with all the extent movies and mini-series, I wish Amazon would allow me to give this adaptation 4.5 stars.    Every film adaptation of Jane Eyre brings something to the table, has great appeal to each generation.  The multi-part versions are able to embrace the novel more thoroughly, the feature-length all endeavor to distill and capture the emotional power of the novel.     Fukunaga's Jane Eyre is for me one of the most beautifully filmed versions, some scenes simply breath-taking (the carriage returning Jane to Thornfield).  The settings work, the costuming and sets (thankfully) understated.  The cast is outstanding.    Where this Jane Eyre gave me problems was the screen play.  While I truly liked the film cleverly opening the way it did (Vol.3 of the novel), the condensing of dialogue felt like short-hand---I was automatically filling in with Bronte's.  I wonder what a new audience gets or misses: the mirroring of the Gateshead family in Vol. 1 with the Rivers family in Vol. 3, the cut-off-from-the-world environment of Lowood and Bertha in the attic.    That said, screen play avoided the awkward Eyre-Rivers relationship (they are cousins)and the over-the-top gothic palm reader bit.  The mention of insane asylums conditions added clarity to the often misunderstood situation of Bertha.        Whether you love or hate this Jane Eyre, be assured yet another version be made in the next five years as it has since about 1930.

0307595862|5.0|Jo Nesbo is one of those writers that seem to get better and better as time goes by. The Snowman is the seventh novel he's written having as the main protagonist Harry Hole, a detective who can in a way remind the reader of the various clich&eacute;s, but which at the same time blows all those clich&eacute;s into pieces. He looks just like an acrobat, walking on a tightrope all the time, becoming the favorite target of his colleagues when anything goes wrong, fighting with his addiction to alcohol, falling down often enough but not staying down; instead he jumps right up and continues where he left.<br />  Things are never easy for him and that's not about to change now as he's called to investigate a series of similar hideous crimes committed by an extremely clever and well-organized perp whom the cops come to call the Snowman. And that's only because wherever he hits he leaves behind a snowman as his signature, as if to provoke the police to catch him if they can, before he melts away and vanishes once and for all. Can they catch him though? Probably not, but Harry is not to blame. He told them from the very beginning, when the first victim was abducted, that they had to do with a serial killer, but none of the big-shots believed him and so a lot of precious time has been lost. \\"This is not America\\" they thought, feeling sure that Harry's idea originated from the seminars he followed at the FBI. However, soon enough the crimes would start multiplying and the corpses of decapitated women would begin to spring up everywhere.<br />  Who's hiding behind these extremely violent crimes and what's his or her motive? Is there a connection between the victims? And are these cases in any way related with a similar one which has taken place twenty-four years ago in a town far away from Oslo?<br />  As days slip past by these and all the new questions that arise remain unanswered, and as a result Harry every now and then seems to be losing it. These cases for some reason affect him personally, they damage his already fragile psyche, and he can't really understand why. Also because of them his spare time is becoming less and less, thus he cannot meet as often as he wants his ex-girlfriend Rakel and her son who considers him as his real father. Finally, they make him want to drink, and that should never happen, not ever again.<br />  The author creates a complicated plot that keeps the action moving and the agony rising from beginning to end, but he also pays a lot of attention to the psychological angle - he dives deep into the subconscious of his heroes. And maybe, for the very first time he throws into the path of poor old Harry, a sister-soul, whom he meets at the face of the young and attractive detective Katrine Bratt, who's not only brilliant but who seems to believe in him more than anyone else ever did, and is willing to do whatever it takes to help him. Their fight, the good fight, will at some points look lonesome and hopeless, but during it they'll keep leaning on each other to make it through, and when at a point some dark secrets will come to the surface, they will not prove strong enough to wreck the bonds of trust that bind them together.<br />  The well-carved characters, the excellent plot, the not too fast action and the constant agony, make this thriller one of the best that I've read this year so far and elevate, at least in my eyes, its hero to the height of John Rebus or even higher.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|Mr. Lucas could offer the original versions along with his (evolving) revisions if he had a scintilla of regard for those who bought the tickets, watched the film, and loved it for what it was/is. YES, Mr. Lucas (as Mr. Spielberg said) is perfectly within his whims to alter, revise, \\"improve\\" these films, but Spielberg happens to feel that he can listen to feedback after all, and respects the integrity of the ORIGINAL film. So we WILL get the original versions of the Indiana Jones, E.T. and Jurassic Park film on Blu-ray. So I imagine I could very well still enjoy in competently rendered high definition this Blu-ray release. But I share Spielberg's view on the matter. I will not lose sleep over it, but Mr. Lucas, why not offer the original cuts and your insecure and impractical revisions together in this set?

B001GUXJQA|3.0|I really enjoy Michael Connelly.  His books are normally easy to read with a good flow through out with plot build up and detective resoluion in the 2nd half of the book.    This book was 85% of the plot thickening, murder after murder, and connections being made for everything, the last 50 pages was the climax of a so farfetched ending that it was unbelievable.  On a positive, I did not see the endi g playing out like it did, but I was so ready for the climax that it really didn't matter what the ending was.    My first Michael Connelly book was with lawyer, Michael Haller, I am starting to think I like the lawyer angle better than the detective angle.  Next book will be back to Michael Haller.

I would thus steer you towards  Tim Brown of IDEO's books on Design Thinking.     I think you will find them much more enlightening than Eric's effort with similar ideas.    I do wish to congratulate Eric on his success in business and his willingness to discuss painful failures as well.

B00005N6KG|5.0|The title of this review says it all. These are very inexpensive running/exercising headphones, and for me they have been worth much more than their cost. They are unbelievably lightweight, which is the secret to how they stay on your head; they are basically so light that they don't even have the weight to bounce around as you run. My run speed varies greatly, including sprinting, and I have never been worried in the slightest that these headphones might fall off.    Comfort: They are designed to fit very lightly into your ear. I imagine this could bother someone (they are hard plastic, not padded), but for me they fit very nicely, and I honestly don't even notice they are there. And most importantly, they stay on your head.    Sound: Good enough. You aren't going to listen to these things other than when you are running/exercising (I can't imagine why you would, anyhow), and the sound is more than adequate for that. Also, they are NOT noise-cancelling; in fact they are actually designed in a way that lets IN some noise. To me, that actually makes them safer. You still hear your music, mind you, but if there is a loud noise around you (i.e. a semi truck barreling down on you), you will hear it (or at least I believe you will - I make no guarantees).    Price: Are you kidding me? I still don't understand how these are so inexpensive. According to Amazon, I bought these 5 months ago, and they show absolutely no signs of wear (note: I'm not going to lie, it's not like I'm running every day here, but my wife and I do share them, and we also aren't afraid to toss them into the closet after a run). The cost vs. the amount of use you will get out of these before they break (if they do break) seems like a great value to me.    Bottom line, I love them. It's nice to finally know I'll never have to search for another pair of exercise headphones (I'll always go back to these).
B0052WSX32|5.0|Listening to this album made me wish so much that Doris hadn't stopped recording in 1967; there could have been so many wonderful albums in the intervening years. However, Doris returned to the recording studio in 1986 and finally these tracks have been released. This new album is just superb and it was worth the wait. Doris' vocals are sublime and her voice retains that intimacy that just draws the listener in. The re-mastering has been done very well and Doris' voice is front and foremost. The tracks have a fresh feel about them. Her introduction to her son Terry's vocal is touching and sincere. I cannot recommend this recording highly enough. I hope we will see further releases from her vaults. Doris Day is back and the world seems a better place.
030788743X|5.0|OK let me start off by saying... I'm not much of a reader. I read computer and science magazines, but I've read maybe a dozen books in my adult life. (I'm 33) Last Christmas, as a joke, my wife bought me the book [[ASIN:1400049628 The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead]] because I had been raving about a TV show called The Walking Dead. I used it for bathroom reading but ended up enjoying it quite a bit. A few months ago I mentioned that book in a forum I frequent and someone suggest that I also read [[ASIN:0307888681 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]] so I went ahead and bought it. I enjoyed that one significantly more then the first, and ended up reading it quite quickly by my standard. (a few weeks) It really sparked my interest in reading so I started searching Amazon for recommendations based on people who enjoyed WW:Z. I happened across Ready Player One in the process. It sounded interesting so I added it to my Wish List hoping someone would get it for my upcoming birthday. No one ended up getting it so last week I ordered it for myself. I started reading it on Monday. I was immediately sucked in. I spent every free moment over the last couple days reading it. This is time I'd normally spend watching TV, surfing the web, or sleeping. I was hooked! And just three days later I finished, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Like I said before I'm not a big reader, and I've never read a book so quickly in my life, so this book had to be something special to draw me in so deeply. I don't have a ton to compare it too, but this is by far the best book I've ever read. In fact I'm thinking about reading it again. :)<br /><br />Anyway if you're a geek, a gamer, a sci-fi fan or just a fan of the 80s then you'll probably enjoy this book and I highly recommend it.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I received my product yesterday and after playing with it for a while I simply gave up.    I was able to see myself, at a much lower image quality, but Kinect was unable to track my hands and face.    I have read some of the reviews posted and found out people who have the Kinect sensor below their TV are having better luck. I am one of the users who have their Kinect sensor above their TV, and for me, that is the only option.    I'll be honest and say I didn't have huge expectations with this product, I bought it more as an experiment. However, all the pre-release reviews sounded promising and built up hype a little.
B0054N73EY|4.0|Not as good as Californication and Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Something in between. A totally different sound. I like it a lot :)
B000002P5R|5.0|If there was ever an argument that Jimi Hendrix was never a very good songwriter, well, I believe First Rays of the New Rising Sun completely lays those misguided claims to rest as a good portion of this compilation is highly enjoyable from a songwriting perspective (and to be honest, most of the material isn't particularly flashy or guitar heavy, so the songwriting is the main aspect anyway).  Anyway, even though this is supposed to be a compilation, I honestly prefer to believe it's another studio album.  It just feels so much like a logical continuation of a talented musician making progress that it's hard to look at it any other way.    Anyway, songs like \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Dolly Dagger\\" are pretty typical rockers by the normally much higher standards set by Jimi Hendrix, but at least the guitar solos are pretty melodic.  \\"Izabella\\" fits right in with the theme of short, sweet and catchy to get the job done.  \\"Night Bird Flying\\" is one of those \\"Have I heard this before?\\" type highlights and yes to answer your question, you probably have.  This version of \\"Angel\\" is probably tied with Rod Stewart's version as far as I'm concerned but I suppose this version is more emotionally impactful in comparison to other versions out there.  That's another fine attribute of Jimi Hendrix- the man can simply stun listeners with his emotional side, whether it be a vocal melody-focused ballad or his own special style of guitar licks.  The guy had it all.    \\"Room Full of Mirrors\\" and \\"Ezy Ryder\\" (love that spelling- I bet the glam rock band Slade were taking notes!) are more fast-paced tunes that probably don't necessarily stand out among the very best work of Jimi Hendrix, but these two songs are certainly satisfying enough to interest anyone who greatly admires hard rock/blues rock.    Let me mention my three favorite songs.  My favorite is by FAR \\"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)\\".  At 6 minutes in length, this is probably the creepiest and most ominous blues song I've ever experienced.Talk about a song that EVERYONE should be acquainted with.  First of all there's a feeling of gloom in the heavy guitar riffs that remind me of early Black Sabbath, guitar soloing that sounds like the more depressing moments of Crazy Horse (think the jam from \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" for example) and it's just a major surprise how much I absolutely love it and how it never once plods.      \\"Drifting\\" probably played a part influencing Robin Trower because the guitar solos are strongly reminiscent of his style and this is another brilliant, underrated song.  It's a ballad... I think.  A unique brand of balladry with a heavy emphasis on a sailing effect that can be expressed by listening to the guitar solo near the end (with a strong vocal melody to make the experience even more fulfilling).  Just wonderful.  \\"Beginnings\\" is my third favorite track- an extremely melodic guitar jam that's perhaps too short, I agree, but every single note is right on the money so there's really nothing to complain about.    Oh, and I suppose \\"Stepping Stone\\" is my fourth favorite song on the entire album.  I mainly love it for the melodic guitar jam (again, every note is amazing) and the quality vocal melody.      \\"My Friend\\" reminds me of Rory Gallagher's mid 70's output, and that can only be a positive in my world.  \\"Straight Ahead\\" is one of the funkiest songs here and the vocal melody is just superb.  It makes me realize which direction Jimi Hendrix was probably heading, though if those rumors are true that he was thinking about becoming a member of Emerson, Lake & Palmer... oh my, haha.  He would have taken his career in the most shocking direction imaginable!    The last three songs are quite interesting.  \\"Astro Man\\" rocks and reminds me of a continuation of sorts from \\"Room Full of Mirrors\\".  They both have a nearly identical fast-paced rhythm carrying the vocal melody along and of course, both tracks are instantly likeable.  Now the final two songs are most surprising to me forbeing based around the blues but both sounding DRASTICALLY different from each other.  \\"In From the Storm\\" is a more guitar heavy and slightly funky (and even gospel) take on the blues with strong vocals as well, and \\"Belly Button Window\\" is a much quieter and relaxed take on the blues with hilarious lyrics.   Maybe a bit *too* quiet but that's alright.    Overall, I highly recommend First Rays of the New Rising Sun.  Who knows if this version is anything that Jimi Hendrix had in mind (I believe it is for the most part with perhaps a different track order) but it's another solid offering by Jimi Hendrix.
1612130585|5.0|Loving Ana & Christian - the email exchanges are truly my favorite parts in the story, there were less in this second book, maily because Ana & Christian are together.  Hard limits soften, their relationship and characters grow - they fight evil together.  EL is so precise with her writing, I can visualize each secene - I did a power-read, and will now re-read at a more human pace.  I will be biting my lip until Book 3 is released.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I love to read, but often find I am to busy to find the time.  This book was our current pick for our book club and so I loaded it to my Kindle.  I started reading and the next thing I new it was 4 hours later.  I finished the book in less than 2 days, and everyone else in my book club did the same thing.  What a touching story without being overly upsetting or sad.  I only cried a the end.  I am sure I will read this over and over.  My all time favorite book is Knight and this is a close second.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|If for any other reason then for the fact that the creators of this wonderful series just doesn't listen to it's fanbase. All we have ever wanted was the original movies cleaned up for the latest format. That's it. No extra characters thrown in (not even necessary). No deleted scenes or musical numbers added (messes up the pacing). No voices added or changed (why?). No Vader screaming \\"No!\\" at any point in any movie (I would not argue taking that out of Revenge of the Sith). No Obiwan sounding like a digital Rick Flair walking down to the ring.     Seriously, it would cost Lucas Arts less money just to give the faithful what they want, and their profit margins would be much higher because of it. Now, I have no problem with people wanting to buy the \\"updated\\" versions of the movie. If you like it, I'm happy for you. But at least give us, for lack of a better word, purists a choice.     So, I'm giving this movie a one for the lack of choice for the rest of us, and asking people out there to stay there hand in this purchase. Maybe if a big enough chunk of us refuse to give them our money, they'll listen (just like with the Lord of the Rings Trillogy Extended Editions on Blu-ray) and finally release a prettied up version of the theatrical movies.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I have seen many versions of Jane Eyre and, by far, I think this exceeds all previous productions.  Beautifully done.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching this well-known classic once again.  I had not seen the lead actors before, so had no expectations of how they would play their roles, and I think that added to the experience.  Of course, Judy Dench is always wonderful to watch!!
030726999X|5.0|This picks up directly after the end of book 2.  If you loved the first two books you will love this.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I for one am boycotting this release. I encourage others to do the same. Sorry Amazon but this is pure garbage and George Lucas is an idiot.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I have a small house and when I first saw this item I was like Whoooooooooo....!!! This is going to make it but unfortunately, after we received the Zoom lens and putting on the Kinect it didn't work at all.    Finally, I restarted and re calibrate the Kinect and it didn't help. I took it off and celebrated the Kinect sensor and the same thing. It cannot see the floor and I couldn't play the games.    This product did not work for me. I tried to put the Kinect under my TV as the suggestions I saw on line but didn't help for me. but happens to be the product by itself looks very nice and it did not scratch my lens like I saw others wrote.    Returning it back right now.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app, best Alarm Clock app I found. It has a lot of customization and works 100% with my Rooted HTC EVO 4G
B004FRX0MY|3.0|This app frustrates me far more than any other on my phone (an Atrix).  I uploaded all of my music onto the cloud player in the hope that it would finally unify all of my fragmented music collections; it has done so fairly well on my various computers (though the tagging and \\"Unknown Artist\\" issues still pose problems), and I love the browser interface.  However, the android app needs a lot of work on the core functionality.  If it worked as it's supposed to it would be spectacular, offering the capability to buy a song from the store, then switch to the cloud player and play it instantly.  It would also free up all the sd card space that music eats up (at least while you can stream it over wifi).  In practice, though, it just doesn't offer the experience it promises.  It force closes about 60% of the time I try to use it.  When I try to scroll through the list of artists on the cloud player it stutters horribly (and usually then force closes).  Music playback often skips.  This last issue may be android's fault, as I've noticed it in other players, though never so badly as in the amazon one.  However, I don't experience the other problems in different music players.  Until Amazon fixes these issues, this app is still just another dumb music locker that allows you to download songs so you can play them with some other application.  It's an exciting idea, and the interface would be excellent if it just worked.
B00006WKY9|5.0|Scorpions were the reigning kings of international metal even though their US impact was minimal in the mid to late seventies. `Taken by Force', released in early 1978 was the German band's fifth album and it had showed a progression of sound and ideas that helped define early heavy metal and was the full culmination of all the band's early strengths. However it would an album of transition for this Teutonic juggernaut as it showed a sign of things to come and was also in many ways the end of an era. Power ballads such as \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\" (which could be their greatest) and \\"Born to Touch Your Feelings\\" would be a critical part of the Scorpions sound that made them multi-platinum arena rock stars in the `80s.  Speaking of arena rock, \\"Steamrock Fever\\" and \\"I've Got to Be Free\\" continue the tradition of straight forward fist pumping anthems started by \\"Speedy's Coming\\" and \\"Top of the Bill\\". The two shinning jewels of this collection are \\"The Sails of Charon\\" which is phenomenal track with a strong eastern permanence and \\"He's a Woman, She's a Man\\" which is as heavy metal as \\"Virgin Killer\\" or \\"Dark Lady\\".   `Taken by Force' was also the final studio album for Ulrich Roth who will always be my favorite lead guitarist in Scorpions, no insult to Matthias Jabs, but they were in many ways a much purer band in the `70s.  Not as heavy as its predecessor but still a remarkable slab of `70's metal, `Taken by Force' is a true classic.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Absolutely love this app! Helped me setup and find the best signal ratio for my router. Great for when you're out and need wifi as well. Thx for such an awesome tool...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I will not buy another Star Wars set until at least the original trilogy is in it's original state and on Blu-Ray!!    Amazon, Lucas will not hear the fans complaints and give us the product we want. While I'm sure you'll sell enough copies please remember that you could have more sales if this was actually a quality product the fans deserve.    I will not bore you with stories of cherished childhood memories or discussions of green and white light sabers. I will, however, speak to you in the language of money. Cash...dollar bills! Something your company will not get from me for this set!!!    I urge you, as a company who seems to know how to please the customer, up-channel this and all other negative feedback quickly. Tell the people responsible that there are others out there who will not be giving up their hard earned cash on sub-par and over-tinkered presentations. Tell them we want all 6 Star Wars theatrical releases cleaned up, in high-definition and on Blu-Ray!     Tell them they can include all the extra versions they want if they must, that's fine. But tell them they need to include the original versions as well!    Until then, I will hold onto my money.    Money $$$.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Once you get the widgets working I don't think there is anything better looking and functional for Android. I suggest using 2 4x1, today and tomorrow on one and next 4 days on the other, this way you can put them on adjacent screens. Great tool, thx for making a great app!
B0042RJWTM|5.0|This is a five star western with two classic acts Lee Marvin & Jack Palance a great story line I've collected hundreds of westerns through the years a lot of good ones and few bad ones along the way Monte Walsh is one the best ever made sad they don't make them as good as they use too.

B004A8ZX28|3.0|After seeing Liam Neeson in \\"Taken\\" I thought this movie would be as good. It was an entertaining flick with a good plot. The directing pace thru the first hour of the movie drags. The last half hour the pace picks up, the viewers questions are answered and the movie finishes well. Neeson's acting as always is good but during the first portion of the story, he seems just as perplexed as the audience. Once the plot is revealed his character turns from a timid personality into James Bond.
B001TODCII|5.0|Well done script  Well done Acting  Well done directing  A very \\"keep you on the edge of your seat\\" movie!  TWO thumbs up ! ! !

1416955070|4.0|This was a fun read! Mixed with vampires, werewolves, witches, warlocks and many others that you could probably imagine. This is the story of Clary. A normal girl with a normal life whose world turns upside down in the blink of an eye. She finds that the stories that she's heard through her life  are all true. There really are supernatural creatures out there. Not only that but there are people called Shadowhunters that are there to keep things in order and people safe. When Clary's mom ends up missing and Clary herself is attacked by a creature, she is taken into the Shadowhunter's realm where she learns more that she could ever expect.<br />I found this book very entertaining and the world inside was interesting. I enjoyed the characters, setting and bits of humor throughout the book. Look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B000VECAEO|1.0|The ranking of one star is for the DVD Edition of the 9th season. The show itself is one of my favorite comedies ever. So keep that in mind if you feel tempted to leave hateful comments for this review.<br /><br />The reason for my low rating is this: In the discs of this season and without allowing the choice of over-riding it, a long anti-piracy commercial (in Spanish, not in English) plays before the show episodes.<br /><br />Worst, the anti-piracy commercial only plays after selecting non-English subtitles. Like if it was targeted to Hispanics.<br /><br />Given the hard time that NBC got with the airing of the 'Puerto Rican Day' episode, one can hardly be blamed for suspecting that the ''ethnicity-selective'' anti-piracy commercial is just a ''shove it down your throat'' feature for customers who's vernacular language is not English.<br /><br />And for the record I am a Puerto Rican who happens to love the 'Puerto Rican Day' episode. Despite the burning of the Puerto Rican flag. And that is because throughout ''his'' series Mr. Seinfeld took the greatest comedic liberties with his own Jewish ethnicity, even in extremely sensible topics as the holocaust.<br /><br />But I can't help to deeply resent the \\"pay back\\" BS that either NBC or Jerry Seinfeld or both wants to shove down our Puerto Rican (nay, Hispanics) throats. And all because of the political turmoil that this episode stirred in most members of my ethnic community.<br /><br />Respectful show-business should be above racial and-or bigotry payback. Too bad that this DVD set of the 9th season of my favorite comedic show of the 90s was not crafted to reflect that. Future generations of all races will judge it for this.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|Does the job! Works great now. Highly recommend the app. If you need lots of info on weather and ease of finding it this is for you.
B004OBQDJ8|5.0|This is my son's favorite movie.  We watch it nightly...I'm not kidding.  All I hear all day is \\"Momma...cars.  Cars.  Cars, momma\\".  Good thing it's funny & entertaining otherwise I'd be sick of it already!  I keep the blu-ray version downstairs & the dvd copy upstairs.  Can't wait to get Cars 2!
B0055S348W|5.0|I don't give out a lot of rave reviews for software.  Usually, one can find at least a few things that don't work right or annoying quirks.  I've been using the free version of this since my first Android.  If you use Google's Cloud Print, it works well with that for free.  However, there are many other useful features that make it worth paying the full $12.95 price.  When I saw this was Free App of the Day, I got excited and made sure I grabbed it.   Just think of a mobile printing scenario, and this handles it.  A great deal at $12.95 and an OMG deal for free!  Amazon, keep it up....good job this time, for certain.
B0055S348W|5.0|great app, however I experienced some problems installing the PDF render library on my commando G'zOne . should be solved if I do it through the pc
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bought this about a month ago. It keeps very good time +/- 5 seconds on average. Its a simple, no frills watch. Also the Day display can be in 1 of 3 languages: English, Spanish and I think Russian .... didn't know that before I bought it. I have a really small wrist (~6 inches) and I think with the crown it's around 38mm .... Looks great!
0307946711|5.0|This is the finest book!  Mainly it is just a very good story with twists and turns until the surprising conclusion.  It takes in twenty years of the lives of the two main characters: Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew.  I won't give even one part away by elaborating on details here.  I simply could not put the book down for long.  And I found myself smurking, and giggling, and tearing up more than once.  The last time I remember feeling this way was when I read Jane Eyre..and I was only 14 then.  Also Gone with the Wind when I was only 34.  Now, at 74, I am thrilled and absorbed again by this unusual love story.  The writing style kept me alert.  You just never knew what wit was coming or what sadness.  Read it.  You'll love it!
B004SIP9U6|5.0|Great twist on a classical story.  Acting and movie well deserved their oscars. Must have for your collection - great romantic movie for guys and gals.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Surprise!  It sucks.  I should have stopped caring about Star Wars after seeing Episode 1.  Instead, I wasted my money on Episodes 2 and 3, all garbage.  It's not like I have the money to spare for this trash nowadays anyhow.
1416575464|5.0|This book is a must have for all those who love to decorate.  While browsing thru you will see all decorating styles from traditional to contemporary and eclectic to shabby chic.  You will learn how high to hang a chandelier and how to purchase a mattress. Love it, love it.

0307887898|5.0|Ries has written a fabulous book that recasts the classic dilemmas of entrepreneurship in a new light and in so doing, provides a wonderfully helpful new lens on how to  successfully navigate them.  Eric's ideas are well-explained and supremely practical.  The examples provide a playbook for actually implementing them.  These principles and practices have become extremely popular with our students, and have helped drive a real revolution in the number and kind of businesses being started not just on our campus, but all over.
B0055S348W|1.0|Spent the last two hours trying to install the drivers needed for my printer. Keeps timing out, or giving a null error. Will give it another couple tries before calling shenanigans.
B00406UK5A|5.0|I'm not saying this is a perfect film.  Had I not seen \\"The Eagle\\" (which wasn't perfect either, but a pretty close copy of this in many ways), it might have had more impact.  Still, this is a great movie, as it relies on natural sets, minimalist acting, and great action to progress the story.  It has enough unexpected twists to keep it moving, but does offer resolution in the end.<br /><br />The fighting is brutal, and despite the obvious CGI bloodbath, has a palatable tension.  Even Olga Kurylenko plays a creepily-hot unstoppable hunter in a way that requires no lines but has a big impact.  Dominic West, as pretty much always, hits it out of the park, and Michael Fassbender is as much a classic hero in this as anyone in recent memory.<br /><br />Excellent on-location shots make it dirty and believeable, and there is enough of a backstory on the Picts to remind you that despite their vicious actions, for lack of a better phrase, the Romans started it. (a fact The Eagle highlit much more intentionally).<br /><br />I liked the acting, the setting, the action, and even with loss, the final resolution.  There are some deeper themes in this movie as well (I'll leave those up to you) but really, I can't think of a movie that has unexpectedly blown me away as much as Centurion in quite some time.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I had AccuWeather Weatherbug, but this widget tops them.  I like the graphical clock and options for temp or precip (even wind if you need).  On click brings you to your choice of details and I like that.  Very Android touch friendly, swipe to see more details/addt'l days, click to see the clock change for rain/wind and even scroll ahead in time.  I like the menu bar temp/weather icon and barometic pressure trend.  This app is great.
B0055S348W|5.0|It works for most of my networked printers, worth the $12 price tag. A must for Android Tab or Phone.
0066620996|5.0|My product came very quickly and in great shape! I couldn't be happier with the buying experience and the product I received.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Well, it is HIS movie and I am like most that think the originals should have been left alone or at least included in the set so we could enjoy what we remembered as kids. There was something charming about the old movies that just gets lost with the new ones and with the numerous \\"upgrades\\" to those timeless classics. I will still watch and enjoy but will do so while wishing for a bit of the charm.
B004EPZ070|1.0|We rented this movie, and it was a wast of $4.00!!!!!!! First it totally promotes cheating on your loved ones wich is what is so wrong with marriages now anyway.  Second, I usually watch \\"chick flicks\\" with my wife because they set a nice happy feeling for a romantic evening.... We went to bed anoid and completely unable to set a nice mood after watching a bunch of cheaters!
