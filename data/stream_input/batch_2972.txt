B00005MP58|5.0|Jane Austen's very best story and this is a very good adaptation.<br />It is a mini series and so is quiet long but this way you get the whole book.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Pictures don't do justice to the high quality of this model. Heads are heavy resin not plastic and expertly crafted. Exceeded my expectations. Great value. Now they need to do something like that for seasons 1 and 2
B0053O89WY|5.0|You can't beat the prices at amazon and dellivery is always on time. The Big Bang Theory is a great show that is consistently funny.  The ensemble cast is outstanding and all their collective quirks make them great fun to spend time with. I would advise you to get this if you love to laugh.
B0056Q7VVE|5.0|This was the first book I ever read on my own.  Wanted it for nostalgic purposes but may pass it on to a child at some point. Book in excellent condition.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Stayed up way to long watching this series, could not shut it off!  Can't wait for 4th season to come back on AMC October 14th 2013!!!
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|Watched it again (after 15 years) with such pleasure. Also great movie for my teens to introduce the concept of communist world. Brilliant, brilliant actors!
B008HK3XOU|3.0|It works; however, I did not like how it secured the Kindle, and it did not do a consistently good job of waking up my Kindle.  I think they should have made a slot for a stylus pen.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Easy. Nothing to it. I would definitely buy this adapter over a USB to Ethernet so you don't have to tie up a USB with that.
144476490X|5.0|I liked the way james was able to adapt the book so young readers could read it with out some of the graphic drug references!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Addictive game! Loved it! Very fun and would recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games. Had to make myself put it down.
1616614609|5.0|This game has really stood the test of time for me. I bought it over a year ago and I have had hundreds of excellent and fun games. You should definitely pick up the expansion packs from the Genesis Cycle and the newly started Spin Cycle. They expand the game exponentially in terms of deckbuilding and strategy options. Unlike Magic: The Gathering (which is a collectible card game), Netrunner is a living card game - you buy the set and the expansions and blam, you have everything. No hunting through booster packs and booster boxes searching for that one extra rare, extra powerful card.<br /><br />Pro Tip - there are a few cards that this set only gives you one of (the hacker consoles, a corporate few server upgrades, etc.) that you will DEFINITELY want at least two of. There are also other cards (mostly hacker programs and corporate operation cards) that you only get two of. You'll want more of those too. If you buy this, and get serious about the game, you'll probably want to get another core set. I have two and I haven't regretted it a whit. In fact I may buy one more. That's how much I love this game. Seriously.
B000TEPKS4|5.0|Classic. The best of the 60's before drugs,greed and despair overtook the Band's and society's throat. Each note, instrument and word is crafted with precision,ambition and yet the relaxed feel of chatting with a good friend. Dylan's influence is felt but does not overwhelm. It draws it's inspiration from R&B,gospel,Folk and Rock yet melts it into it's own distinct sound.
1451683405|3.0|Harris writes as if he knows all there is to know about this issue, but it turns out that he bases his conclusions on brain research that many other neurophilosophers deem too limited in scope.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|There is not enough details or instructions.  Once you figure it out the game is quite fun. Time consuming but fun.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This little guy is incredible. The compact functionality of it is really efficient and useful for the musician who needs as much space as possible.
B00821OX98|5.0|Every season brings it's own set of problems.  We love the characters and the story lines.  We heartily recommend the series.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|I thought that the movie was great.  This soundtrack basically takes cuts of the movie and makes a playlist out of them.  Which is exactly what I would expect.  The reason I didn't give it a 5-star is that at some points I feel they could've made their cuts better, and the sound volume on this is much lower than any other CD or song that I have and I have to adjust the volume on them.  The sound editors should've payed attention to that when making the CD!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I read in a kindle help book that this little thing would allow me to transfer files from my computer to my kindle, which would be handy.  So I ordered it, and son-of-a-gun if it doesn't work just like I hoped it would.  I was initially concerned that I wouldn't be able to distinguish between it and the power cord (at first glance they look the same), but on closer inspection, I noticed the USB symbol on the pug ends.  To those who wonder, your power cord will only get you power.  I was unable to transfer files over it.<br /><br />Note to Amazon: it'd be great if the USB cord was a different color for those of us who need reading glasses to see the symbol.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Honestly in my opinion there is only one author I adore more than Riordan and that's Rowling. As always he delivers suspense, action, and a little bit of heart ache. I can't wait for the next books and I hope to the Gods the wait flies by!
0307165485|5.0|had this for my children on recommendation of my vet at that time(35years ago).  her young son loved the book-given to him by someone.  my oldest was never without and became really upset when his got lost.  we went quickly to buy another. i give them at baby showers and new arrivals.  wish they still had fabric covers.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|One of many great albums by Pink Floyd . The mind blowing lyrics by Roger Waters are timeless. Must have.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|I got this for my mother who is very hard of hearing. For her, it was a total success! Except for the part where she forgets to turn it off and ends up with a spent battery. Now that she's learned that lesson, she loves it. It works!! Don't hesitate to buy it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I am generally not a Will Ferrell fan, as I prefer the good clean family-type movies.  Despite that, I very much enjoy this movie!  I have watched it many times.  It is cute, funny, has many quotable lines, and has a nice little story about family and love.  This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  I would recommend watching it if you haven't already.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Just great my husband was really excited! Thank youi The last CD I bought I am saving for Christmas! Thank you
B00BQ1D7BQ|3.0|Just wanted to chime in with a review of my own. This CD is a decent enough sounding Blues/Rock album. But, people claiming<br />that Steven Stills has got his voice back are going way over the to with that statement. I'm a Stills fan, especially his<br />stuff with Manassas, but his voice here is way too gruff to be considered on par with his early material. He can just barely<br />get to pitch in his high register. If this CD was made by an artist with none of his history I seriously doubt it would get<br />the 5 stars that are being thrown out here! That said there are some good blues moments. I've always loved Muddy Waters and<br />the piano on Honey Bee is very enjoyable. And the Strat riffing on \\"Only Teardrops Fall\\" is pretty sweet. \\"Word Game\\" has a<br />little of Manassas's rhythmic feel, and throughout the album all the support musicians get the job done.<br /><br />Five stars no, but a solid three stars.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Keeps me occupied during commercials and waiting till it's time go to work. You have to submit a review to unlock extra levels. I feel manipulated : (
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books I have read recently  and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have their heart touched.
B009AMANH4|3.0|great acting great stars but you already knew that. Steven blew it on this one. Some how it came off boreing, i was truly disappointed. I might have been expecting too much. But it just didn't do it for me sorry Stephen!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie was great!!  I was a little unsure of how well they would do moving this from the on-stage musical and the book (which are different from each other by the way) into a movie.  Well, I think they did great!  They balanced great vocals with great acting as well as they could.  I have to admit... not all the vocals are super amazing.  But if they were, then the acting would've been sub-par, and I think that they made it work for them very well.  I also liked how they took some parts from the musical version and some from the book version.<br />Also..  since this musical is about history/The French Revolution, and has people such as Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman, some guys I know, who generally do not like musicals, actually enjoyed it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The reason I did not give the app 5 stars is because when you have more than one horse the energy level of the horse you are using and the others you own goes down even though you are not using the other horses. But other than that I love this app because it teaches responsibility and dedication and it is super fun
6304401132|5.0|Grandchildren really loved it.  fast and speedy service. Sleeping Beauty is a movie for all ages.  Young and old will really love it.
B00D6QUMWG|4.0|and her magnificent ability to act with her voice are both in evidence here.  She almost seems to be channelling Maria Callas as Lady Macbeth, unafraid of creating sounds that are less than beautiful but perfect for the role.  I can't wait to see her in the part!  The contrast of the Lady Macbeth cuts with those of younger, more appealing heroines are dramatic to say the least, but all are beautifully sung and distinguishable as the heartfelt expressions of very different, but strong, women.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|When I came across this best-selling book of short stories in the Sci-Fi genre, I did not really expect anything of the kind. The narrative of this young but extraordinary author is undoubtedly astonishing. The style is both intellectual and lively, scientific and exciting. In other words, a supernatural mix of talent, ideas and delivery of exquisite literary work, incorporating a human touch into some universally significant issues. A book to be reread and enjoyed every single time with no regret whatever.
B006LSZECO|4.0|First time reader of G. Flynn..I will read her again..few twists in the story, which is good!<br />Characters well developed
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is great!  Not as great as seeing it in person, but still amazing.  I love how much more they project their voices on stage vs. in the movie (although I love the movie, too!).  The voices are phenomenal and I enjoy the ending with many of the past cast members.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Not all free apps are this good! Great way to end a busy day and unwind. Will look out for new ones!
6305212112|5.0|Fried Green Tomatoes is one of the greatest movies Hollywood has ever made.  It shows the importance of human relationships better than almost any other movie I can think of.  It shows two different time periods, the 1920s and 30s, and the 1990s.  It shows us four different women as different as could be and how they grew, in the relationships of each rime frame, into careing for each other and changing each others lives in each time frame for the better.  I am aware that no review can convey the true greatness of this movie and the deep emotions this movie awakens in the viewer.  I can only say this is a damn good movie that you will truly love.
159448385X|5.0|We know so very little about Afghanistan, and how this country has treated it's women.<br />This book takes us through several iterations of government, all with different impacts on the lives of the two main protagonists, Laila and Mariam - two women with different backgrounds whose lives intertwine.<br />I can't remember the last time I was moved enough to sit and sob while reading a book.  This one touched me every bit as much as Les Miserables did when I was a much younger woman.  It was all about love and redemption.<br />This is one of the very best books I've read in the last many years, and am grateful to Mr. Hosseini for writing it.
B0049VZ222|5.0|What all the talk is about.  After the 1st two episodes,I was hooked and watched all the other seasons before the next one starts
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Blake is the man..strong heartfelt country music. He is so genuine and you can hear the trueness in his voice...coming straight from his Oklahoma born soul!  Great album!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|When you click on an item you get error messages. Too many oops! for me to recommend. I stopped using it.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Had fun playing game, but then avira antivirus detected a malware in it.Shame too, I had been enjoying the game.
0920668364|5.0|Funny and a classic.  Whenever anyone is having a baby, I always get them this book. You will love it too.
0761172726|5.0|Have used updated versions of this calendar for about 7 years.  I've tried high tech 'family calendar' solutions but they always took time and remembering to access the computer to keep them updated.  So I always seem to end up back with my tried and true!  The layout is perfect for managing you, your spouse and at least 3 kids schedules without a fuss.  The headers are flexible (except for the pre-filled Mom), so you can fill in who ever you need to track for.  And the spaces are nice and big to write down all the appointments, playdates, games & recitals.  Plus my kids and I both love the event-related stickers that come with it, so you can &#34;decorate&#34; further.  However, every month has an adorable Boynton vignette, so stickers are not absolutely necessary unless you are 7 years old and obsessed with them like my youngest  :-)  Highly recommend as a low-tech solution to keeping track of the always-crazy family schedule.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Granddaughter has now watched this movie 5 times by herself and she is only 5.  Had watched it many times at Grandma's
B0000CE9VW|5.0|Pantera is still awesome to listen to.  This compilation gives the best of several albums so you don't feel that you're missing how great this band has always performed.  Get this CD/DVD.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|and what more is there to say?  love the music, the voices, what a wonderful concert this must have been!
0061537969|4.0|A very well written and readable novel.<br />Any dog lover will enjoy it. It has humor, sensitivity, drama and sadness without any cloying sentimentality. And I learned a little about Formula One racing.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Two of today's best actors make this an incredible movie.  There were some plot holes, and timeline continuity issues, but the acting was stellar.  And the backstory on Magneto heartbreaking.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Good fast paced read. You need to keep turning the pages. Ideal for long flights or lengthy train journeys. Lee Child just seems able to deliver book after book.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I misplaced my Kindle Fire Cables so I decided to order this one.  I used it to transfer book titles from my Kindle Fire to Calibre and it worked great.  Nice purchase at a reasonable price.
B005544TRQ|3.0|It's been done many times before just another law firm. So, nothing to write home about yet still entertaining. Good thing is the characters have a lot of places to go.
B0016NF06O|5.0|and what more is there to say?  love the music, VERY talented band backing up MArsalis & Nelson.  what a wonderful concert this must have been!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I've been sneaking around reading Harlequin romances since I was in elementary school. I'm guilty of loving the typically short, sexy, romantic, feel good stories. Waking Up Married didn't leave me disappointed.<br /><br />Megan has had her share of failed relationships and has decided all she wants is a child. A sperm donor will do...no relationship, just impregnate me and go.<br /><br />Connor is just getting out of a relationship that he thought was perfect. She would be the trophy wife and accompany him to events and tag along when he's out of town and he would make sure she was taken care of...but she wanted more. Who needs love in a relationship when everyone he has ever loved has failed him.<br /><br />Things take an interesting turn for both Megan and Connor when they meet each other in Vegas. She has a plan but his is better....She can be his trophy wife (no love) and he can provide the children she so desperately wants. On a drunken whim they get married the same night they meet, only the next morning Megan has no recollection of getting married or why it seemed like a good idea. They decide on a 3 month trial, at the end of which they can continue the arrangement or get a divorce.<br />I really, really loved this book. Mira Lyn Kelly seems to be a writer who is easy to follow, will make you laugh and feel good.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Love the series.  I have not bought the eleventh season yet but will eventually.  I will miss Cote De Pablo but understand if she wants to try other things.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I really enjoy playing the different varieties of games this provides.  A real challenge for one's memory skills and concentration.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I will make this simple. Without fail there is one Halloween movie suitable for the family, no gore you know, that we watch every year. This one! It is great for kids, but with the GREAT casting, it appeals to adults too. Perfect blend of adult and kid humor. Beautiful production too, gotta get the blu ray next.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Really, you make this movie after the standard set by the Walking Dead. I felt like MTV made this movie with so Brad moving all around the world and so many cuts. You take a brilliant actress like Mireille Enos and relegate her to the wife afar with nothing to do be wait in angst. The bright spot was the understated performance by Daniella Kertesz. I will definitely watch her in the future.
B000008HPE|5.0|a very talented group, great musicianship, great vocals, love LEwis' voice - just a great listen song after song, album after album
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Another great album from Blake Shelton. Great mix of songs that will have you singing along!  You will not be disappointed!
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|Great episodes the original series were the best my husband has wonderful memories of watching he said it was still as enjoyable as the first time around
B00C7LB20C|3.0|Enjoyable, with a few plot holes. Think ~ (Bourne crossed with Taken) x 2/3. Not too intense, not too loose.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I really enjoyed Planet Earth. The photography is excellent. I recommend it for schools - grade school-high school ages,  Frances L. Knight
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Reading this not long after Slaughterhouse Five, I can say that I'll be reading more of cynical old Vonnegut. He's cynical but so right, nonsensical with a rare clarity, a joy to read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn has created characters who are so well developed the reader becomes part of the story.  You are equally disturbed and engaged.  Definitely one that you have trouble putting down for long!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about this book. I'm glad I took the risk and read the first book and eagerly started the next one as soon as I finished. It's a love story with some kinky twists. Truly enjoyed this book and look forward to the movie!
B00CATONCA|5.0|one of the best tv series out there if you love zombies and suspense you will fall love this show.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Wish Amazon would offer the third of the trilogy, with instant viewing! Really don't want to rent or purchase it. Waiting to see if I can find it cheaper elsewhere.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|They raise the bar with every new episode they make. Great to have all of season 3 together now. Best show on television.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This book is the funniest I have ever read koodoos guys.  It would be a great movie as well, here's hoping.
006074815X|1.0|This book was very slow and it took a long time for the story to become interesting. It was a waste of time reading. His other books are more interesting.
1478951508|4.0|I just recently began listening to audio books to pass the time during the long commute to my new job. I had been listening to comedy books, but wanted to try something different. I selected this one because (a) I loved J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and grew to love many of the characters, and (b) I thought it would be a light-hearted read about an English community.  I was wrong about it being light-hearted. This novel turned into a dark story with wonderfully developed characters.  I felt all were very realistic with flaws that drove me crazy. Every one of them reminded me of someone I knew.<br /><br />I have to say when I first began the CD I was taken aback by the language and some of the sexual scenes.  I wasn't expecting that from the author of Harry Potter, but once I got past the initial shock I was able to settle into the story. She delves into some difficult subjects - child abuse and neglect, drug abuse, teen angst, the divide between classes. There are some difficult scenes to get through, but I agree with another reviewer  - really good literature isn't always easy to read. It's thought provoking and can bring you to tears or make you angry.<br /><br />I grew to really care for these characters and was sad to see the book end. I believe that's the sign of a great book.<br /><br />One last note: the reader, Tom Hollander, is fantastic!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Looking for a Fun, yet challenging, yet relaxing App..... This is for you!  I watched the tutorial twice, and have been addicted ever since!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I read The Hobbit years ago as a child and adored the adventures. This movie was so well done, it brought it all back to me. The only problem is, now I can't hardly wait for the next one! I thoroughly enjoy being able to &#34;watch instantly&#34; thanks to Amazon. Nowadays it's just so much easier than either running out to rent a movie or purchasing one and either waiting for it to be delivered or driving to the store to purchase it. Plus, who really has the room to store all these movies? For the few times you may choose to watch it again, you're better off paying 1.99-2.99 and watch it instantly.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Over the top violence and a thin plot, but lot's of fun if you like action. If you have a good home theatre audio system it will get a heck of a work out. Turn it up!
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My boyfriends little 5yr old girl loves this game!  I'm always looking for a simple kids game that will keep her interest and<br />she really loves this game.  There's always something for her to do on this game...even the little mini games keep her interest.<br />She never gets bored with this game.
B0037QGS0A|4.0|Thrilling! Suspenseful! The acting is superb. Just the right amount of adult content.It's a great stalking movie you will enjoy.
B004EWFUQY|4.0|Because I am using the diet and it does work.  The food recipies are marginal and there is a lot of reduncancy in the chapters.
1743156502|5.0|The lessons learnt from listening to the course is outstanding,and professional.<br />Now the hurdle of implementation,discipline  and follow through is required from me.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Awesome show!  I can't wait to catch up on the last few seasons!  After hearing so much about the show I finally decided to see what the hype was all about.  I'm so glad I did and now I'll be catching up!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|It's like the director spent hours and hours reading through Rich Kids of Instagram and decided to make a movie based on their foibles. Then realizing that would be a little too direct, decided to more indirectly make fun of those silly over privileged youths.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Love this game!  It is easy to learn and very addictive. It really makes you think about how to solve the puzzles.<br />You can get through this game very fast....so take your time. I would love to see more puzzles added.
B009XHAM8G|1.0|I am baffled at how many people gave this book 5 stars. I was duped by that I purchased an electronic version of this book and, stupidly, read it to my 4-year-old daughter before reviewing it. My daughter was puzzled at the woman crawling on all fours and questioned why she needed a ladder to see her son - IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I didn't have a good answer. But who does have a logical answer for that? The relationship portrayed between the mother and son reeks of co-dependence and general sickness.  Don't be duped by the 5 stars. And if you do choose to buy this book, for goodness' sake read it first and then wait for the visceral reaction.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a Stephen King fan from way back.  Haven't read to many of the newer books but this one is one that caught my attention because I loved The Shining.
1423101499|5.0|This book is a another great one in the series.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this series or type of novel.
B008Y212PI|5.0|You'll never tire of playing this app. You can choose your board from three different sizes. So there's always a difficulty for anyone from beginner to expert. You'll love it.
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|Just got to love the Bruce Willis movies to keep renting these things.  Were on a long plane ride and decided to download this.  Good decision.
B007N3206E|5.0|Great job product came on time and as expected watched it right away and it was perfect I would do business again for sure

1423101502|5.0|This book is a another great one in the series.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this series or type of novel.
044024367X|1.0|I have always enjoyed the Jack Reacher books.  This was just plain AWFUL!  I hate to give up on books, so I resorted to skimming just to get through it. It was quite boring and tedious.  And to top it off, Mr. Child had Jack go to bed with a woman whose husband was in the hospital????  Come one - that's just terrible. Glad I borrowed this book and didn't pay for it.  You'll be sorry if you pay any money for it.
B0055S348W|3.0|Was hard to set up originally, so could not use as needed in the beginning.  Have not tried since.  Seems as though it would work though.  Had good ratings.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|I ordered by accident and I paid too much, i could have purchased retail a lot cheaper. It looks nice and it works but not necessary to purchase at the high price.
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|I use divination devices regularly. And my Kindle is already in my bag when I head out the door. When I need advice its a lot healthier and discreet to pull out my kindle and grab a card than to pull out a deck. These have proven to be very accurate and helpful.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Very easy to read. Plot development is great. Love the characters. Looking forward to reading city of glass. Then when I am done with this series I am hoping to finally get some sleep!
B00498YZH8|5.0|I started watching this movie, knowing nothing about it except that the star of Hunger Games was in it. Jennifer Lawrence's performance in this is amazing, as is the the rest of the cast. For a movie in this cinéma vérité style, the screenplay is exquisite. The wonderful irony is that in this movie Jennifer Lawrence plays a heroic Katniss Everdeen character in the real world's &#34;District 12&#34;! How awesome is that!!

0817439390|5.0|This book has a wealth of knowledge on exposure and all its abundance of options. I recommend this book to anyone who is needing some basic and advanced information. No one will be disappointed. It was recommended to me by a proficient photographer who is the president of our local club.
B000000OQF|5.0|I think we listened to this on cassette tape in High school? lol This is in my top ten of favorite rock albums of ALL TIME! (Wish they were still together. :(  )
0061122416|5.0|It's a story that dares you to not settle and to search for your dreams. Although it's not the easiest route at times you can seek out the greater story within you. Learning the language of the world along the way.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I was sceptic at first, but I changed my mind after a few minutes of game<br />Though its semplicity it is very addicting! Try to believe it!!!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I like this game.  similar to a ds game I had.  pretty fun with several levels.  worth the money.  it was free when I purchased it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Sad it's over, could have read another 900 pages. It made me cry, laugh and sit on the edge of my seat while reading. So good!
0894803123|5.0|What a fun book! We've only made one recipe so far, but it was easy so I know we'll be making more. And a great price too.
078322933X|5.0|I always remember this one from the 90s. Mark Wahlberg Allissa Milllano,and a YOUNG Reese Witherspoon did a great job in probably one of there FIRST movies ever??? (guessing here???)
B0087X728K|5.0|Delivery fast. The product was very good, my thinkpad easily passed the temperature test. Already used it for a month, no issues.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Only the original Ironman is worth owning, manly because of the back story. Ironman 3 is a great rental. I wished they spent more time on Happy and his relationship with Stark. There are some throw away characters in this movie and it's good t see Sir Ben Kingsley employed.
B008D28HYS|4.0|This game is addicting! A sudoku is fun and all but once you've done one, you've done them all. This game rewards your logic skills with an interesting image! It starts out Very easy and quickly gets harder. Some puzzles take 5 minutes... some take 20, some I haven't finished yet. It can get a bit frustrating sometimes but that's the fun of logic puzzles. My only complaint is that my fat fingers often click on the wrong square lol. I could zoom in but then I wouldn't be able to see the colors on the outside of the grid. This is a time consuming and addicting game, so be prepared. I wouldn't pay $5 for it (I got is as the FAOTD) but I'm also pretty poor. If you can afford this game, it will bring you much enjoyment!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is simply fun and shows great imagination and use of artistry in final pictures created. good game for all levels and ages
0920668364|4.0|I really love this book, and I give it to all new and expectant mother's  The Real Circle of Life!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was very entertaining and the premise will be excellent for a book club discussion.  I wonder how many women could find a letter addressed to them from their husband marked &#34; To be opened in the event of my death&#34; and not open the letter??  Hummmm.......
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This was a summer reading book for our daughter required by school.  She liked it okay - may have enjoyed it more if it hadn't been 'required'.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|I really love it and it is a great for little children. Also when you play the game Ben's voice is really funny. Btw it is a free game. I hope you guys enjoy playing it. PEACE!
B001BR7CZW|5.0|All I can say is, &#34;how can you not, love the Blues Brothers; it's a classic!&#34;<br />&#34;We're the Good Ol' Boys from Nashville.&#34; Genius.
1608199096|5.0|this recipe book is fantastic... the dishes are easy to put together and also not too difficult to get depending where you live....<br />and it's  close to authentic cuisine of the region involved...
B000000OQF|2.0|Great album (one of the best hard rock album in the 1980s).<br /><br />What I don't like, is that the Cd was just put in an envelope without even bubble rap for protection.  I also received it a week later than the rest of the stuff I bought; though I bought them all on the same day.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|So much talk about this show that I finally wanted to check it out to see if it was just hype. It lived up to the hype, I loved it. The first couple of episodes were pretty intense but it mellowed out a little bit from there. Can't wait to see season two.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|We tend towards the Sci-Fi, Fantasy themes with witches and warlocks especially with our daughter.  This was a good movie.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|I love Buddy Guy & have for years! He's still going strong, as proven in this great CD set. If you love Buddy as I do, if you love the blues, get this latest by him. You won't be sorry.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|The movie brought many questions from my teenagers which is what I want. The quality of the DVD was great.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|How enlightening can one book be? Do you think that you are an extrovert or wonder why you're so shy? Or do you worry that your child will never survive in the 'grown-up' world of outgoing, aggresive individuals? Here are the answers that will change all that. Now parents can understand their childs behaviors as well as their own and learn how to better help their children and themselves. This book is not only informative but fun to read. It should be required reading for every school principal and most company CEO's. Don't miss it!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I LOVE a good Zombie movie and this was FANTASTIC!!!  These were the BEST Zombies I've ever seen! The story was great, the action kept me on the edge of my seat, the acting was wonderful and the special effects were absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD!! LOVED IT!!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|This book started out well, even thorough out it wasn't bad, but the end? Worst ending ever! All the build up and then blah! What a waste of time!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Of course the flying was amazing, but the storyline was pretty awesome as well.  Had me talking to the character and pulling for him to do the right thing.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Beautiful! Fabulous! I'm glad it got the Best Picture Academy Away and that I added it to my little collection :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Novel keeps you guessing right up until the end. Not nightmare scary like I thought it would be because I don't like scary books.  This was more of a mystery/drama.  Definitely drama.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|this was the most amazing series on tv, the ending was unimaginable!! and the acting was incredable, should get an Emmy
B00CL151G4|4.0|I would recommend the product if you have an interest in a different presentation of Holmes and Watson.  Good entertainment.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoy figuring out the puzzle and seeing the beautiful art work. This game is worth the price. I would highly recommend this to everyone.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Action packed and a fun flick to watch.  Enjoyed it with the family and did not want to miss a moment.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|This was a waste ... the dvd's don't play!<br />I want a refund.<br />Don't sell broken junk!<br />It is very disappointing.
B00C5WR6JE|5.0|Bill Frisell's sound is so unique. He is mellow, but energetic. It's a different jazz vibe. This CD takes me away. Since I live in CA and spent a lot of time in Big Sur in my 20s, I particularly love the reference...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|[[ASIN:B009KS4XRO BINGO Blitz - FREE Bingo + Slots]] I love, love, love this bingo game! Lots of levels and rewards that are so much fun to go through. Only problem is, I start playing and don't get my housework done!
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|If you are a fan of South Park, and Puppets, this is pretty much the best movie ever created.  It's Hilarious.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Best Iron Man movie ever!! I really enjoyed watching this one. It had a lot of intense scenes to it!!
0375842209|5.0|Five stars seems to fall short when it comes to Authur, Markus Zusak’s, unique and astounding approach to an historial event which is centered around the time of Nazi Germany. Both the characters and the narration; through the eyes and ears of death (itself) is a genius approach and addictive hook!! This is a page turner like never before. The imagery within this story is constant throughout.  The altering between perspectives throughout the chapters in this story is both perfected and profound. This is a MUST READ for everyone. Extremely well written. Amazing!!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Action packed and very interesting as are most James Bond movies. Daniel Craig is a formidable substitute for Sean Connery.
B009XWD02G|2.0|I tried to find the se app which downloaded to my phone. I could not find the same thing so I thought I would  this one.  Anyway I found it difficult in which to navigate and I was unable to get to the genre of music I like.  I have since removed the from my carousel.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Great movie but he should have died in the end. Everything was building up for him to be a martyr but i feel like the studio made Nolan change the ending for future projects.
B008BF9ZFM|5.0|A small sleepy town comes alive when fishermen arrive to participate in the annual fishing derby. Peter Collier describes how the slow pace of the town drastically changes when \\"the hotels fill up and the campsites, too.\\"  Suddenly, \\"the roads gets clogged; it's quite a traffic mess.\\"<br /><br />It's a mess, but a fun and exciting kind of mess. Many fun characters arrive to compete in the fishing contest. One of them is Dwight Dingle (the name alone is funny already!) who \\"wears the fishing hat with the hooks of all kinds\\" and whose \\"fishing pole is simply named `Madge'.\\"<br /><br />Then, there is Jake, whose \\"buttons weren't buttoned all straight in a row,\\" there is six-year-old Kate who \\"baits all the hooks with old cheese mold,\\" and Larry who loves to exaggerate, like a true fisherman. His fish \\"had wings and a lion's roar.\\"<br /><br />And these are just a few of the delightful, creative, and imaginative characters you will meet on the pages of this wonderful book. Do you want to know who won the fishing competition? You will have to read the book and find out for yourself.

B00DY951RQ|4.0|i had to return my deluxe package because of a flaw on the remastered copy of self portrait. amazon is sending repacement but if the problem is not corrected will send that back. amazon does not seem to understand that this problem has been much discussed on various bob dylan websites ( steve hoffman music forum , expecting rain etc. ) it is a problem that has to be corrcted by sony music. I will buy the standard 2 disc package and wait for the release of disc 3 as a stand alone issue (hopefully this will happen. as for disc 1 + 2 great addition to the bootleg series.
B000GW8OXC|5.0|Lots of extra photos, all the lyrics and the sound... on Vinyl, simply kills the CD version of this double album.

1400069289|5.0|Duhigg's writing style was engaging and clear;  it was a page-turner!  At the same time, the book would be a textbook for marketing and psychology students.  I read it on my Kindle, then had to have a hard copy to share with friends and family.  He dealt with stories of people from many walks of life, each inspiring in its own right.  Although approached from a scientific point of view in the introductory chapters, he uses the stories to personalize his ideas to reveal power that few of us are aware of.  His accounts are eye-opening to say the least.
0142410314|4.0|this met all expectations and arrived earlier than I expected thanks, will consider this avenue again if and when I need to.
0307943232|3.0|He takes books on cd with him when he goes to dialysis.  He loved the book and wants a new one every month.
B00DG292SK|2.0|This memoir is just a string of random thoughts. NOt well structured.<br /><br />Very sad story of drug and alcohol addiction, told by someone who doesn't seem to have much respect for his wife/children and himself.<br /><br />Didn't finish the book.  Lost respect for the person telling the story.<br /><br />If you are a die hard fan of The Who you may find it interesting, but I discovered I really only liked some of the songs, not the artist.
B009GESJH2|5.0|as always kid rock has amazed us with his wonderful  songs. my husband can not playing this cd great job
B00BEIYMIS|3.0|There seems to be a pattern emerging in which any film associated with Lionsgate, the \\"Saw\\" films, Eli Roth ... and James Wan, automatically get heralded as the 'second coming'of horror movies. After being duped by \\"Insidious\\" and \\"VHS\\", I went into \\"The Conjuring\\" somewhat excited but also cautious, and I was right. Although a decent horror flick compared to most crap unspooling in Hollywood these days, \\"Conjuring\\" is not all that frightening or for that matter ... original. While it does have a couple of cool scares, the ending was a huge letdown to me; way way too sweet and up, as if the producers and studio was afraid to send audiences out the door with their teeth chattering. \\"Conjuring\\" is pale compared to \\"Sinister\\" or \\"VHS 2\\" (which blew me away at times) but it's not wasted time in front of a screen either. As for the rating, 'R' for being too scary? Hardly. If this is a fact, then the MPAA seriously needs to be replaced with a panel of people who know how to properly rate movies. Better yet, get rid of the whole dumb rating system entirely. This film is a PG-13 at the most. Compare it to the 1976 film \\"Burnt Offerings\\" which received a 'PG' and yet went places with unpredictable terror and violence, along with an incredibly dark ending, that to this day cannot be matched or will ever be matched by a PG rated movie. I'll take that Dan Curtis movie over \\"Conjuring\\" or anything Mr. Wan has done to date.
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS is my favorite show and I love all of the characters. It never gets old watching it and all of the characters have remained enjoyable to watch. My set is complete with the tenth season and I plan on purchasing future seasons.

B00F5FBE82|4.0|I'm not a die-hard Drake fan but I must admit that I am really digging this album. The music is eclectic,  soulful, and mellow for the most part. While I am prone to say, \\"I don't get it\\", when it comes to allot of hip-hop artists, I find that Drake is actually quite easy to understand and even relate to.
B00D6DVRX2|5.0|I wish there were 10 stars to rate this CD.  I wish Sting was my neighbor and I could bring him over a plate of cookies and tell him that since Soul Cages, this is his best work.  He made his father very proud with this CD, I'm sure.  CD 1 is Sting, amazing, fun, past paced, slow and unique.. just amazing.<br /><br />If you are a Sting fan, buy this CD.  It's worth it's weight and more in gold.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Nicely written and hard to put down.  She sucks you into her journey right from the beginning.  There are no false notes.  You may share little in common with her, but you will want desperately for her to succeed.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Without a doubt, this film gives one a very ample and educational rendition of the highly cosmic stature of the extremely sensitive, creative,and true musical artist, Nesta Robert Marley. He was a unique gifted musician, and a highly sensitive humanitarian.

B00005JMCW|5.0|Like its predecessor 1998's \\"The Parent Trap\\", this is Walt Disney Pictures remake/update of their original film, also both \\"The Parent Trap\\" and \\"Freaky Friday\\" star Lindsay Lohan.  The difference is while \\"The Parent Trap\\" remake was as good as the 1961 original, although in a different way, this 2003 remake of 1976's \\"Freaky Friday\\" is much better than the original with Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster.  It's updated neatly into the twenty-first century with expert comic tandem acting by Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan.<br /><br />As the film opens it's a Thursday morning in Los Angeles, psychoanalyst Dr. Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) a widowed mother of two is planning to get remarried to Ryan (Mark Harmon) on Saturday.  While her young son Harry (Ryan Malgarini) seems all right with this, her rebellious teen-aged daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) isn't happy about it.  Anna and Tess also clash about Anna's schoolwork, band, appearance and general attitude, there is a definite generation gap.  At a family dinner that night at a Chinese restaurant, they openly battle in front of the owner's elderly mother who offers them fortune cookies which she insists they take.  Upon breaking the cookies they read the enigmatic fortune inside and experience an earthquake that only they can feel.  The next morning upon awakening Tess and Anna find to their horror they have somehow switched places, and each will have to experience the other's Friday, and try somehow to find a way to switch back before Saturday's wedding.  Through the course of the \\"Freaky Friday\\" each learns that the other's life is not quite as smooth or easy as she thought, as they try to get through the craziness of the day.<br /><br />Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are exceptional at capturing the dual roles they play.  I was particularly impressed by the way both women were able physically to suggest the change in character.  For example when Ms. Curtis is Anna in Tess' body, she is tends to be more relaxed in her posture, tends to lope along, slouching whereas Ms. Lohan as Tess in Anna's body is more rigid and precise in her movements.  They also tend to capture the subtle nuances of the other, and have a keen comic rapport, playing off exceptionally well with one another.  In a word, their performances are inspired and FUNNY, with some heartwarming moments as well, and give the film the sparkle that makes it work so well.  The supporting cast is fine, starting with Mark Harmon as Ryan, who is the perfect likeable fiancé for Tess, and young Ryan Malgarini as Harry, Anna's mischievous younger brother has some expert facial expressions as he reacts to a couple of bewildering situations.  The others Chad Michael Murray as Jake, Anna's would be boyfriend, Harold Gould as Grandpa, Christina Vidal and Haley Hudson as Anna's girlfriends, Rosalind Chao as Pei-Pei owner of the Chinese restaurant, Stephen Tobolowsky as Mr. Bates, Anna's obnoxious teacher and Willie Garson as Evan, Tess' most neurotic patient, all good.<br /><br />The screenplay by Heather Hatch and Leslie Dixon is a nicely done update of the original Mary Rodgers novel that was published in 1972, originally the mother was a housewife, here she is a working mother, while the daughter was a gawky thirteen year old with very few interests other than the boy next door, here she is fifteen and very interested in her band and music.  It's clever, and very amusing, and as I mentioned above gives both Misses Curtis and Lohan a chance to shine.  Besides this, it's very family friendly, younger kids can definitely watch and probably enjoy themselves.<br /><br />The music used is pretty good as well, starting with the 60's classic \\"Happy Together\\" by the Turtles played over the credits showing various paintings/photos which riffs into an updated version as the movie begins.  Anna's band's music I think will bridge the generation gap, both kids and parents can enjoy, Lindsay Lohan gets a solo at the end, and sounds pretty good. Best of the special features probably is the \\"Backstage Pass with Lindsay Lohan\\" a behind the scenes look at the film.  So sad to see Lindsay Lohan still relatively normal and unspoiled, considering her recent troubled history.  There is a deleted scene that really was not a great loss to the film, and also two alternative endings plus the ending used in the film, actually not much different in the various versions.  However director Mark Waters talks about the deleted scene and the various endings so the viewer is given his perspective.  There is a cute \\"bloopers\\" set, and two music videos, Lillix \\"What I Like About You\\", not bad, cute bit of business with Lindsay Lohan in it.  The second one I didn't especially care for, Halo Friendlies \\"Me vs. the World\\".<br /><br />Bottom line,  I highly recommend `\\"Freaky Friday\\" it's a bright, lighthearted film that is very enjoyable entertainment  in the best Disney tradition, but which has an underlying message.  You could say it's that very old maxim \\"Don't judge another human being until you walked a mile in his/her shoes\\", or in this case body!
B005LAIHEA|5.0|A very funny movie.  Laughed out loud, while watching it alone.  Plan to watch it again with girl friends very soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love that it has different types of clues. this ensures it is never boring! my husband and I play this instead of watching Tv.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I felt more educated in the harsh life of a world unknown to me as I read this beautiful book.  Yet, there is always hope for the two blessed women.  The story is harsh as was their life and yet love came along and joy after all the suffering.  I thought the end was abrupt and wished it had not ended.
0374533652|4.0|everyone should read this book. It really puts in to perspective how money has managed to edge out the morality in everyday things.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|This thing hasn't sharpened my knife a lick since I've used it. I thought perhaps I was doing something wrong but after further consideration I think it's just crap.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Love the reboot of the original cast. Hope the next script is fresh material instead of rehashing the old scripts
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I wondered how they would match last years' Grammy-winner, but they did in my opinion.<br />A few changes in the line-up, makes the overall sound a very small 'difference'-- but if I did not KNOW that in advance, I probably would not have noticed right away.<br />Favorite tune : Do I look worried -- a 'feminine-empowerment' anthem.<br />That said- would recommend this CD to anyone..!!
B00701QRJU|5.0|I bought this because my husband wore out his old vinyl one and hadn't heard it for years.  We heard it had been re-mastered and released and are so glad we have it.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This is a great movie and the characters are absolutely darling! Adults and children both will love and enjoy this movie!
B007VDN1PA|2.0|It was quick and easy to use. The results were disappointing. There was no different in the quality of the scan at 5Mp and 10Mp, even though the file size was larger. The results were just too grainy.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|I am a big Sci-Fi buff. I am anxiously awaiting season 2. Will try to get to watch season 1 again very soon.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|I only listened to the first two numbers.  It's unbelievable how bad this is.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Wasnt expecting anything new from part 2 but really Fun so far :) just wish the \\"buying\\" stuff with money on a game we pay for I'm not to happy with that but not really needed to get 3 stars so I don't mind it so much :)
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This film was a ton of fun, even though at times it has a mature theme.  The music was terrific and the comedy, let's just say Rebel Wilson deserves a gold star.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|This was my favorite of the series.  It was witty, fun, action packed and unpredictable. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a light hearted fun movie experience

B002O3Z4Y8|1.0|I really liked what I saw..Unfortunately it was a defective dvd and I was not able to see more than half of it. Too bad I threw away the package it came in before I played it. It makes it too inconvenient to return it for a replacement.

B00ESY77LO|2.0|I usually will sit out a movie even when it's terrible just to give it a chance, but I didn't make it an hour into this mess.
B00138D320|5.0|IMO, allmusic really underrates this fantastic album. This is pure funk from needle drop to dead wax. Hang up Your Hang Ups is good as any electro funk/jazz/fusion piece out there.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|This is a great show.  We started watching the current season on TV, and had to have the earlier seasons to watch on DVD too.  Good action, keeps your interest.  Some humor thrown in, great show.
B00CL151G4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it! The series is masterfully written and the characters interact very well.<br />What more can I say.<br /><br />Tom Giguere
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Overall a good read. No big surprises within the plot but the story keeps one guessing as to the out come.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This dvd set plays perfectly.  As for the show itself, it is done so well, in every way that nothing else need be said.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|nice i like it . it is cheap and Practical easy to use but sometimes it is crash i think becuse its beta
B0083H6AQA|2.0|The costumes and the acting were very good But the movie seem to Not move along very well Could not hold my interest.
0142421715|5.0|I loved the book and it is in great condition, thank you very much. It's great to know that the purchase came just the way I expected it to :)
B009O2XY12|3.0|Must have internet access to play this which very much limits when I can use it as no wi-fi at work, so I can't play on breaks which is what I wanted it for.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|I could not get sound from Amazon when I tried to watch it. Other programs played but this one was silent. I probably would have loved it, but that day I hated it since there was great visuals and no sound.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Yay  wow super cool and hard to put down! Been waiting to see how things would work out for Clary and Jace! I was not let down can't say any more or will give away the good stuff. If you've read the first two books you'll love it if not read them first.you will so not regret it!
B00EDPFJA4|2.0|I went into this album expecting it to be better than Drake's previous album and to be album of the year material but it is not as good as Take Care but I'm not going to compare the two. There are about 4 decent songs on the album: Tuscan Leather, Hold on We're Going Home, Wu-Tang Forever and Pound Cake. The rest are pretty forgettable or just bad such as Started from the Bottom, Worst Behavior, Come Thru and The Language. The thing that carries this album is mainly the production because despite him not being a great singer he sounds good over the production. However the production stays near the same pace throughout the entire project so it could become boring if you plan to listen to it from start to finish in one go. If you are a Drake fan then you will probably love this album. If not then there are certainly more exciting projects to spend your money on.<br /><br />Good/Decent Songs:<br />Tuscan Leather<br />Hold on We're Going Home<br />Wu-Tang Forever (This song could've been better if he was singing the bridge instead of yelling it. It kills the smooth vibe of the song)<br />Pound Cake (If you are a Jay Z fan then you probably won't care for his verse)<br /><br />Bad Songs:<br />Started from the Bottom (From the information that is known about Drake he has probably the most fortunate come up story of all time. Any other rapper could have made a song like started from the bottom and it would be significantly more meaningful)<br />Worst Behavior<br />Come Thru<br />The Language<br /><br />Drake is an artist that is not particularly good at either of his talents in a way that he's not going to be in your top 10 rappers and he's not going to be in your top 10 R&B singers list if you listen to a variety of either genre but he's good for a casual listen because the sound-wise his music works.
0141345659|5.0|I loved the book and it is in great condition, thank you very much. It's great to know that the purchase came just the way I expected it to :)
B004XGN8W4|5.0|rugged easy to set up what more could you want...<br /><br />well honestly I'd perfer it to always be hooked up inside the case and a single plug conning out of the back to power the whole unit... but as it stands I still rate it as a 5 star item.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a great book.  It took a few chapters to understand the combination of plot lines but once it clicked I couldn't put it down.
0545265355|4.0|The series is very addictive, there are some great reflections to make on our current society. Personally, I think the quality of the books decay from 1 to 2 and get a little better again on 3. The teen romance bores me up a little and seems to be more in the way of a great plot
B00A0HQ7H8|2.0|Only a few good songs. American is good. Gods and Monsters is ok. Cola is sort of good if your in a certain seductive cheating mood.
B00B2FLDRQ|4.0|This book is hilarious. The main character is a brilliant professor, somewhere on the Autism ladder, Aspergers this time. He sets out in a very rational way to find love and marriage. He has a plan so as not to waste time and he ends up eliminating all prospects immediately upon meeting them. Of course, he falls for someone that he has eliminated and the book is about his quest to get the girl.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really dig it a lot,  ya hear! Ya hear what I'm saying!?!<br /><br />I like it!  yes indeed!  yeah buddy!!
0439813786|5.0|This book is adorable.....watch the movie &#34;Hugo&#34; to see a version of it.  Another addition to my granddaughter's Caldecott collection! Have been buying the complete list of Caldecott winners since she was born!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love it but it won't come up anymore. Would love to play it again. I so enjoyed diamond dash.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics, intriguing puzzles.  Unfortunately, like  Mist, there is a sense of isolation and lack of interaction.  Anticipating the next chapter.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|Once I established the proper connections between the devices I am using, the hum completely disappeared. Solved a very frustrating problem. Ignored the warnings against using Behringer products! Great value for my money.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|As a person who enjoys fact over fiction, this was a wonderful read.  Very hard to put down once started.<br />It is amazing what our armed services do for us.  I cannot understand the pain and hardship they go through.<br />Thank God for them.  Please read if you enjoy thrilling reading.
B000SEGTI0|3.0|It was good to finally read the book that the movie Blade Runner was derived from.  As I watched the movie first, and many years ago at that, I was surprised at how much different the book was (or more correctly, how different the movie was from the book).  It doesn't happen often, but I think in this case the movie was actually better.
859037985X|5.0|Filled with valuable knowledge, thoroughly explained example code, and useful exercises. Also makes the differences between Lua 5.1 and 5.2 clear.<br /><br />This is not a book on learning how to program, this is a book about Lua. All professional Lua programmers should know everything in this book.<br /><br />One of the best programming language textbooks I've read. More of them should be like this. (Most of them lack exercises)
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I chose this review because, although it was great, it ended at a very inconvenient time. And since I have no more money left on my gift card, I will have to wait awhile before getting the next one. Still, this is a very good book for middle schoolers who like takes on classic fairy tales.
1400052181|5.0|great condition for used book. it was a little bit worn out, but it had no serious damage. the book looked as though it was taken care of.
0807014273|5.0|The book is a fast read. It is so enthralling that time just flies by as you read it. For anyone who thinks his/her life is hard this is a bracing reminder that you are still far luckier than a prisoner of war. Every description of the life of a death camp survivor made me feel lucky to be free and healthy. If you have problems feeling gratitude for the good things in life then this is a must read. The first part of the book describes the every day experiences of forced labor and calorie deprivation. It is a tribute to the power of the human spirit. The second part of the book is a non-technical description of the type of therapy that Frankl used for his patients. It is a highly effective, practical approach to reorganizing one's thoughts in order to overcome feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Frankl was clearly a brilliant man of deep convictions. No educated person can ignore a work of such importance.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book makes you see your life a different way. It keeps you gripped on it until the very end. I never wanted to stop reading it . It's just so DAMN BEAUTIFUL!
B001MTENOC|5.0|This now my 'go to' book regarding anything about the afterlife. Containing information in sequence regarding the stages we go on to experience after death; with personalised examples collected from many case histories. If you had to recommend 1 book to someone who wanted answers to what happens behind the veil - this is the book! It has inspired me to make some life changes.<br /> Its also the only book my husband has allowed me to read out to him - so it must be good! Highly recommended
B009V3KKXY|5.0|The Paracord eBook is perfect, Great seller, Fast, Prompt delivery. I will definitely be ordering from this vendor again. Thank You.
B008220BP2|3.0|Ah a love story that proves you \\"R\\" what you eat. Taken f from the original story of Capulet and Montague - revised as \\"R\\" and Julie.<br /><br />Before you get the feeling that this is just another cross-species love story you find it also an action movie with a fast car and guns. There is some nice music; too bad that they did not play \\"Muskrat Love.\\"  We even have a swimming pool scene in which they are not wearing swimsuits.  The balcony scene is a tad too familiar. It is the East and Julie is the sun!<br /><br />Actually this presentation is cut above a lot of the later zombie movies. It is a story about love and redemption. It may even have a redeeming value for us as we learn all zombies are not the same.<br /><br />For DVD viewers there are the standard extras that do not ass much to the experience with the exception of the voice over that tells what you are supposed to be seeing.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater and I loved it again at home.  It's the first in the series and I can't wait for the 2nd movie to come out.  It's a little graphic for young children.
159413586X|2.0|I hope they don't make this one into a movie. Does not live up to the first two books. Sorry, Suzanne.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|Great whether you have seen the film or not.  Big fan of Cliff Martinez soundtracks. Great for playing in the background, too.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a great free alarm app and it is the simplest alarm app I have ever had on my kindle and I love it!
1478951508|5.0|I loved this book!! As the reviews show, this book is not for everyone. It's deep! J.K. Rowling is a brilliant author, and I can only hope for more adult novels. I have to admit to writing down the names of all the characters, and would recommend that in a book with so many main characters, it would be helpful to list them.<br />The people who don't love this book are the \\"Hollywood Happy Enders\\". This book seeks the truth, and probably hits too close to home for some. I could not put it down. Next I read \\"The Cuckoos Calling. Great book, completely different genre. J.K. Rowling is talented enough for write any type of book. I would encourage her to write more adult books. I will buy them all!<br />Jonnie Johnson
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My 7 year old loves everything Batman and this dvd did not disappoint. He watches it over and over. Ok, I admit, I watch it with him. Money well spent.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|My girls love MLP and honestly, so do I. I wasn't sure if we were going to like the movie when we first heard about it.  The creators did an amazing job of keeping it true to MLP with the new twist of the characters becoming human girls.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Great series! I recommend this to anyone. Not your typical zombie lore. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Cannot wait to see the new season.
B0009VSB06|5.0|hello, have no idea of the capacity of ACE 150? signal until depth issues.<br />I hope you can help me with this doubt.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Really good songs that are easy to listen to time and again.  What I was hoping for from Phillip coming off his American Idol win. I look forward to his next album and hope he is able to create material as good the second time around.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|A must for all. This product does what I. Have always been looking for, simple way to view computer onto the TV. Simple set up and use makes this a must buy, very cost efficient device.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|My son loves MLP:FIM, so by proxy I'm suckered into watching the show which i love. When i saw ads for this i had a dreadfulfeleing the shark was being jumped. I am here to say not so! This is done in such a way the Equestria Girl will be totally separate from MLP.<br />If you remember the show Sliders you'll get the premise of this.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It loads up quickly, it's easy enough to change locations, and it's about as accurate as any other weather source. That's all I was looking for.
B0099HUB8Q|5.0|I remember the first time that I read the stories of James Herriot. Still at high school, and not having a great time of it, these books took me away to a much happier time in history to a life that I have always wanted to replicate.<br />The stories have stood the test of time and are as vibrant as lively as they were forty years ago!<br />Easy to read and painting a clear picture of life in rural England before World War 2, I can't recommend this book enough to anyone who has a love of animals, an interest in real life history and a desire to be reminded that there was a time when life was a lot nicer.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|The writing and acting are superb. This is exactly how an alien invasion would look and feel in my opinion.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Excellent Movie, Good versus Evil, Truth versus Deception.<br /><br />Truth Wins and the Enterprise Crew saves the day!<br /><br />Worthy of multiple viewings.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|FAMILY MOVIE. ALL AGES WOULD LOVE THIS MOVIE. CHARMING, SWEET, CUTE.  MY GRANDSON LOVES THESE CHARACTERS, BUT SO DOES MY HUSBAND.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Dvd arrived quickly, good  condition and included all inserts that original product would have if purchased new in the stores. Plus good 3-d price.
1401907725|5.0|Bought this for my mother, as she always has known in her 75 plus years of life, the history of our family being intrigued by angels, spirits, and guidance from unseen sources.  Earlier in life, up until recently she was always afraid of dreams she had, or premonitions, etc  I kept telling her it is a gift and you should embrace it. This gift has been passed down through my great-grandmother, as far back as the late 1800's (her Gmother) and it's time to be good with it all.<br /><br />She has known of my acceptance from a very young age.  She sometimes hated when I was accurate with things growing up, sometimes she loved it.  I have been my mom's physical guide practically my whole life.<br /><br />She thought about this for a bit, and finally was able to accept this.  She is no longer afraid.  Surprised her with this deck. She now uses everyday, and has helped her in many ways, she is more calmer, and I love the daily guidance she receives from this deck.  Great, great, deck/guidance for beginners, or whom is finally accepting of unseen sources in our world to enhance our lives.
B004V9MU86|4.0|Very goos book. Give it a bit of time as it takes a while for the story to unfold. But very well written with an innovative style.
B000003CMC|5.0|GREAT album takes me back to the 70's. Very strong throughout with Mountain Jam being the anchor and bookended by Melissa and Blue Skies. Superb instrumentals.
B008518MOW|4.0|If you like aliens in America and the M In B who monitor their crazy antics, then this fun film will deliver the excitement, laughs and a few in-your-face 3-D effects.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|The music, the setting, and the characters are charming and appealing.  The narrative is equally sentimental and predictable.  This well paced, well made film is a forgettable, albeit entertaining, bit of fluff.  Probably appealing to those over 60!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best shows on TV.  The set dressing, costumes, acting and storyline are superb.  You can get very invested in all the characters.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love the game. It was fun and addictive.  I wish it had more levels to complete.  I like the fact that there are hints to help if you are stuck.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Got this as one of the daily deals and enjoyed it very much. Set up as an autobiography, it's an intriguing look into the life of a boy whose parents' ill-concieved decisions thrust him into life situations he could never have imagined ...
B000AJIF4E|4.0|this is more about the Amazon customer service I received than the product I bought itself. After six weeks of using these at a light use level, the sound stopped coming out of one side of the earpiece. I called their customer service-got to a rep within 5 minutes which i think is pretty good (they use a dial back system) who promptly shipped me a new set right there on the phone. I fully expected to have to have a big hassle because it was past the 30 days-or wrap them up, ship them back, wait for them to verify that they had gone bad, wait for the replacement to get here--but none of that happened. The rep told me they did not want them back because they were defective and would I mind putting them in recycling somewhere in my town ?(no problem there !<br />)  even Costco does NOT give this kind of excellent customer service-nowhere near !. minimizing the hassle for the customer who bought something that had a problem ! wow ! unheard of in this time of being treated like the customer is a major inconvenience!
1551525143|5.0|My only complaint is that it's too short, but only because I burned through those pages incredibly quickly.<br />The artwork is so well done, and the simple techniques Julie Maroh uses to carry the emotion and the unfold of the story keeps you glued to the pages. The romance between the two main characters is so palpable. Recommended for anyone seeking an LGBTQ read, or an amazing story about the ups and downs of coming of age love and passion.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Opinions might vary based on this one. My 23 year old didn't enjoy this one as much because he didn't feel the villain followed the comic series at all well and the action, although good, was less than what he was expecting.  He still thought it was a good flick, well worth seeing.<br />I  thought it was great.  It was a good balance of action, characters and not too dark of a story line.  It was my favorite of the series.  Well worth watching on many levels.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Does what it says.  Downloads youtube videos for offline viewing.  Dont kn Kowbwhy it was banned from google play. Hmmm
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I actually really enjoyed this movie.  Sci-fi isn't always the deepest of plots or contain the most gripping of story lines.  But I was entertained.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|This product was recommended by an Amazon customer service person to fix a charging problem for a kindle fire.  It will charge the kindle, but the problem still exist.  If when plugged in, I set the kindle on the end, with the kindle weight on the cord connection, it charges.  Otherwise, it's will sometimes charge & sometimes will not.  It seems there is a loose connection in the receptable on the kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I really don't know what to say... you may even find this review not very useful but really????! really?? Was it necessary to end it that way? Maybe the writers for Downton will get back to me because I really don't understand .......why!!!!!!! Is there no hope!!!! All that is left to say is that you have to watch it in order to understand.
0812550706|5.0|I enjoyed this book and was surprised to find it was originally written in 1977.  I am now looking forward to the movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've always enjoyed this game. I have it on all of my devices. One of the better bingo games out there
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Got this app free as app of the day. Just like the old Missile Command. Lots of fun to pass time while waiting for an appointment. Buy faster missiles and more missiles and you'll last a good while.
B00ELU7A4E|1.0|You get almost nothing on this and the song is available for free online legally. So what is the point? You are a sucker if you buy this. They are just trying to steal your money. The case it comes in is very cheap looking and flimsy. It might as well be a paper sleeve.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book grabbed me ,what a story. I knew there had been orphan trains and I'm sure some children were lucky and some were nosy ,but this is very evocative of the times
B003V6L94Q|5.0|My wife is a huge Zac Brown fan and is enjoying all three of the CD 's.  They're being played every day.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Oldie but goody!  So much fun to watch and the music never gets old. Makes you want to get up and dance.
B00973902K|1.0|The lyrics to this so called \\"song\\" are absolutely awful. The lyrics are definitely the worse part...if you actually listen to the lyrics and comprehend them you will know just how little effort and thought was put into this song. Seriously just understand the lyrics, but most people who listen to this song would not even care about lyrics in a song...what do lyrics matter in a song? This song is made for people with no music taste whatsoever. It is simply one of the most annoying, worst excuses for a song created in the year it was released.<br /><br />How this singer was even on a singing competition and got past the first round makes no sense. She cannot sing. And whoever she hires to write most of her lyrics obviously can't do their job either. Why anyone would listen to this song is beyond me, they must seriously have no music taste whatsoever. If you like this song you have just proved to the world you have no taste at all...not even remotely. This song is an utter embarrassment, and most people who listen to it are kids and kids should not even listen to this song but it has very suggestive lyrics for no reason.<br /><br />The song is trying to be cute but it's actually rather nasty. If you listen to the lyrics it's about a woman who is extremely easy to get into her pants, meeting a random guy and agreeing to put out just about is what the song is about, she says that she just met this guy and gives her number and this is crazy...yes, it is crazy. What kind of s word gives her phone number out to the most random guy who doesn't even ask for it? She goes up right to him and gives her number to any guy she thinks she might have a chance of having intercourse with. It's pathetic.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Its all about kids sticking together for something they believed in and in the end the good guys win.  Its accepting people for who they are even if they are different then you are.  It's all about learning to see beyond the outside and looking at the inside.
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|High quality product!  I have 2 of these. Excellent for traveling so you're not limited by hotel plug locations. Highly recommend.
B00B9JDBT8|5.0|Great new album from such an important band.<br />What really blew me away about the vinyl release was the quality of the packaging. You can tell they put a lot of thought and effort into it. You end up getting so much more than just the album. Really a great piece altogether.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I bought the Kindle version because the book version  was just too heavy for me to hold and read.  It was a great investment as it is now one of my all time favorite books.  The detail and events shared in this book make history come to life and the people that took part seem real rather than just &#34;paper people.&#34;. The author shows cause and affect in relationships and ambitions.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A work horse, for solitaire players.  A must have game on any device.  You get used to the ads, and as a free game it is good to view the ads every now and again  helps to keep it free.
B00CZAYOWI|4.0|the raw side electric I believe is garage sounding side I like a lot. The other side is to polished for me, yet I do not dislike it, it just could have used a little less effects in the mix.
B00007KLJJ|5.0|We saw the movie on TV and decided it was a keeper! Now we can watch it anytime we want!
B00DDQTKHM|5.0|This is the textbook of a course in Digital Media that I'm taking at Georgetown University. I'm very glad the professor chose this title because it's very up to date and you can incorporate the advices to your daily routine at work. I love the way the author integrates the importance of relevant content in everything PR and Marketing related.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed it.  A chick flick with a real plot and really good acting  with outstanding scenery
B00008QSA5|5.0|I hold this one near and dear to my heart. It is the opitamy of Jam band albums. Truly a must have. Please, if you're still on the fence, BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!
140191716X|5.0|It's a beautiful book and if you believe in angels (I do!) there are wonderful prayers and guidance lessons from our angels.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I use to have kik on my kindle for a long time until it broke and i had to get a new kindle. And ever since ive tried to log in it hasn't worked. And i don't know what's going on...so i would recommend that you not waste time getting this app
0470449764|5.0|Ranked by difficulty, this book was critical for getting more comfortable with how quant questions are written on the GMAT.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Without giving away, the ten man at once fight scene is one of the greatest these eyes have fallen on. The story is one of hardship and triumph. Of love of family and love of country. If you can stand subtitles and/or dubbing, buy this movie and treasure it
B00DYXBAMC|4.0|I had never heard of Zendaya Coleman until she appeared on Dancing With The Stars and then a few months later I heard her track REPLAY on you tube and was intrigued enough to buy the entire album.  Her debut album is pretty terrific - mixing elements of pop/dance/r&b which suit her voice AND the lyrics are age appropriate but not so kiddie-like that I couldn't relate.<br /><br />The way that Zendaya's career is blossoming very much reminds me of Brandy because she has a wholesome image and is growing a career in acting & music.  I love that her parents are involved in managing her career and that they're allowing her to be a child and haven't exploited her to sell an image.<br /><br />This album has great flow and features up tempo & mid-tempo tracks primarily.  The tracks I really like are:<br /><br />REPLAY - catchy track<br />HEAVEN LOST AN ANGEL - nice hip hop/r&b vibe on this track on which Zendaya raps a little<br />CRY FOR LOVE - very sweet, sincere vocals on this mid-tempo track<br />SCARED - she is giving great ATTITUDE on this track<br />LOVE YOU FOREVER - another really sweet track about hopeful feelings a young girl has in a relationship<br /><br />The only song I really don't like is BOTTLE YOU UP<br /><br />I hope Zendaya gets opportunities to perform and get her music out there because it's a great collection of songs that she & her team of producers should be proud of.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I was surprised at how much fun it is! I would recomend this game for anyone.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It gave much needed perspective for me to view the rise of unions and the quest for workers' rights right along with women's rights in various countries.  Persuasive arguments for equality of individuals and classes under the law.  Also reminded me of the growing wealth disparity in the US and the views of the upper, middle, and working class people.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read the shining and I saw the movie both the one with Jack Nicholson and the tv movie which was almost exactly like the book and this one was great.  Absolutely superb. I'm glad he  wrote a story about Danny as an adult .loved it loved it LOVED IT!
B000A2GS2W|5.0|I recommend this CD to anybody who enjoyed the &#34;British Invasion&#34; in the 60's. The Animals were a perfect example of what a bunch of English boys could do with rhythm and blues.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This is one of the best movie ever watch.it's real educative. Its one of the movie that I will like to watch every time. But only that it's expensive to watch on line.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's very fun and addictive as other people said.<br />The 5x5 stage is pretty easy to solve but it gets harder as it goes to the upper level.<br />It is a great game and good brain stimulator.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The knife is functional and useful. The width of the blade makes this knife very sturdy.  The handles have screws for easy removal or replacement.  At under 100 dollars this knife is a deal.
031606792X|5.0|I was glad to add to my collection of Twilight Books and to receive great service and a great item what more could you want..
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Since I love Bocelli's voice I am already biased in my review of &#34;Passione&#34; He sings like an angel, and the whole album for me was sheer enjoyment. Very nice choice of tunes. Also loved the duets.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a really slick alarm clock, very easy to use but has lots of nice features, highly recommend. Well worth 5 stars.
B00594XOZU|4.0|It says that I can't login and it won't let me make a new account. I love this app please fix it.
B005D0RDTS|5.0|Great experience to hear this live concert in Europe. Excellent registration! To be recommended to people who loves the great Miles
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|I was looking for a document camera to use in the classroom and decided to give the IPEVO Ziggi-HD High Definition USB one a try.  For the price it cannot be beat!  I have been using mine daily for over a month and have had no issues thus far.  I would tell anyone considering buying one that it is worth the money.<br /><br />Be aware that movement lags on the presentation at the higher resolutions.  I reset my camera to one of the lower resolutions instead of one of the higher resolutions and now there is no lag when I am demonstrating on a document for the class.  My students have had no difficulty in seeing the display even at the lower resolutions.<br /><br />Since I do not work at a school that provides document cameras or smart boards, I am very happy with the usage I have been getting out the IPEVO and look forward to using their other products as well.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Just wish they'd come out with a new set of challenges more frequently than once a week.  It's fun to play with others!
B009A7E7SK|5.0|I rate 5 star because this really works and is easy to do and fast ,I've been doing and I see the resorts I encourge everybody to get if you want to have a flat abs.try it . you will love it to.:-)

B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|I never liked Self Portrait and it seemed strange that there was so much inferior material on it.  This release makes Self Portrait seem even stranger now.  If the excellent material on Bootleg 10 was available, why did Bob put such songs as The Boxer and Blue Moon on the original Self Portrait?  Although, I don't think there is much here that is essential Dylan, this is a very strong collection and thoroughly enjoyable.

0143143492|3.0|Professional readers can be hired, Mr.Tolle, to enhance the listener's enjoyment!  I love listening to books in the car when I'm on long trips.  His tinny soft voice lulled me to sleep, almost  driving right into in a guardrail and a soyfield in the first 2 attempts to get through it.  Read by Peter Coyote, Sigourney Weaver,  Michael Douglas or any other professional, the book  could have inspired and eased the monotony of hours.on the road.
B003MC5N28|4.0|My son's 7th grade English class was reading this, so I decided to as well.  It was a good book, I just wasn't a fan of the cliff-hanger ending.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Anyone who is remotely interested in Dylan's work will love the new and redone tracks found on another Dylan classic.
1476727651|5.0|What can I say? Fabulous, Surprising, Instant Classic! I don't want to give any spoilers here, but this is a sequel and probably the best I have ever read. King has a lot of recurring characters in his novels, but I never saw this one coming and when I realized what I was reading I devoured it in 3 nights! Definitely one of King's best works ever!
B003UYUP58|5.0|I was looking for a non-fictional/autobiographical book to read to get myself out of reading fiction all of the time and this book came across my path and so I gave it a try. It is very well written and informative but also told in a way that is easy to understand and educational. I thought maybe it would be &#34;depressing&#34; due to it being about one of the diseases in our culture that has a huge death toll, but in fact, it is not. It describes how new medicines have come about, how we have advanced in surgery, and also how the numbers for survival are in fact getting better and continually progressing. I am not finished with the book yet, it is semi-long but it is very good and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in medicine, cancer, biology, etc.
B00DU73T08|4.0|Interestingly different. an original twist on the old body snatchers idea, this movie works because of interesting characters and the way they interact. Also, it has a good ending, which is rare these days.

B00FEHXCIG|3.0|The continuing saga of Iron man was full of action and humor as expected. The story line lacked a certain something that just didnt live up to the first two.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I'm now a real fan of C.C's, and would recommend this series to anyone looking for good reading and a change of pace.  The City of Glass is book 3 in the series, so I recommend that you go to the beginning and start with book one. You won't regret it.
B0069R21JQ|4.0|The sound of MOFI's Life's Rich Pageant is amazing. I would give it 5 stars, but my copy arrived slightly off-center.  I still highly recommend it.
B00E9P959O|3.0|This review requires three components.<br /><br />First, the Vapor Trails material is very strong. It has been since Day 1, whether in the \\"wall of sound\\" mix or in this new mix. There are some excellent songs here, and the playing is very good, as is to be expected.<br /><br />Second, the first mix of Vapor Trails was an acquired taste, but one I acquired. I liked it after I accepted the booming, thunderous muddle of a sound it was. It was a departure, but it worked pretty well. It didn't diminish the material in any significant way, in my opinion. It just made it a bit crunchier than normal Rush.<br /><br />Third, the remix of Vapor Trails is not an acquired taste, as it is more mainstream in its sound signature. Now, that change has pros and cons. There are songs where the new mix reveals them in very nice ways. There are songs that lose crucial emotional punch because some passages have had their power drained away. Overall, it definitely makes your ear listen to the songs anew, but I don't know that I'll end up preferring it in the long run. It's like seeing an x-ray of your hand. It makes you appreciate what's underneath the dermal layers, but I still prefer hands with skin, mushy as it may be.<br /><br />A nice alternative mix, but only an alternative. Some songs work well with this new mix, some songs work better in the original mix. Too bad they didn't get Vapor Trails right the first time.<br /><br />Or did they?

B00DRGQZRG|5.0|Superior quartet refreshes Dave's playing with something really new - I mean, old.<br /><br />I feel like we just stumbled into the long lost recording of a hybrid super group containing members of Mahavishnu, RTF, and Jeff Beck's Blow by Blow band.<br /><br />Kevin is a star, but the drummer, keys (Fender Rhodes, BTW) are all equal to the best of the best.<br /><br />Back to Kevin.  He plays like a man possessed or more specifically like he is trying to atone for all those years with Jay Leno.  :)<br /><br />Dave Holland has done it again.  Not only has he made tremendous recordings and concerts for the last 40 years, but he evolves and holds my attention.<br /><br />Great record.  I may play it for a month, but I'll probably have to break out some old vinyl from yesteryear.<br /><br />Incidentally, I should add that while there are some fusion bands out there, what distinguishes this is their sense of melody.<br /><br />It feels very fresh and not like they were trying to recreate something.  More like they just found it themselves.

B00CL151G4|5.0|When first I heard that there would be a show about Holmes in NYC with a female Watson, I was left cold.  My curiosity was peaked by the casting of Jonny  Lee Miller and Lucy Liu, whose work I enjoyed in the past (Trainspotting, Eli Stone and Liu's turn on Southland).  And it became and remains a complete joy to watch these two pros totally make these roles their own.  Great chemistry,  The nods to the canon have been clever and amusing. Terrific support from Aidan Quinn (whom my wife has loved since Desparately Seeking Susan) and Jon MIchael Hall (bringing a silver lining to the cancellation of the lamented Detroit 187).

0307279189|5.0|The author was able to tell an entertaining story at the same time as giving runners a lot of research on why we can have less injuries and run faster if we run in shoes with very little cushioning or support. In other words, we need to use the many muscles in our feet to prevent injury.
B009AHWM5A|5.0|Resident Evil is my favorite series, and here Capcom proves it can deliver and kick ass movie that feels almost like one of the games! The returning characters Leon, Ada, and Hunnigan act like fans of resident evil 4 and 6 would expect them to. the new additions bring that same Capcom flair, a must see for Leon fans or just fans of the Resident Evil games period
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Broadchurch is one of that genre featuring tortured detectives (Tennant) battling inner and outer demons simultaneously.  I could have done with less of the inner demons, but the mystery is well played out and solved in a convincing manner.  The acting and cinematography are excellent.<br /><br />You may wish to view this series using subtitles if you're not familiar with the dialects of English spoken in the series, both from Dorsetshire, where it is set, and Tennant's own thick Scottish accent.  The accents can be impenetrable, not usually a problem for me, but many times I found myself wondering what had just been said, backing up to listen again, and still being none the wiser.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I never have read the books, and heard a lot about the story.  But, I never knew the whole story surrounding the book.  All I thought about the movie or book was that each area has a pairing set out in area to fight to the death and whoever makes it the end get great wealth.  I did not know about the premise of what happens when you are chosen.  There are a lot of symbols that can come this movie that could view in our society.  At the end of the movie, society chose that love made it possible not wealth or education or survival of the fittest.  Love or respect of one another, I'm not sure what to really call it.  It wasn't about families battling each other, it was about little nations fighting each other.  They were educated in different ways that provided themselves survival in the Hunger games.  The sacrifice that the main character makes in this movie is uplifting and makes an interesting movie.<br /><br />The quality of the movie was really good.  I didn't notice at first, the movie was in wide screen, so it had the black bars on the top and bottom.  Here what really bother me the most was that the player itself played the movie in widescreen and it had black bars on top and bottom.  I think the player did not let the movie filled the space well enough.  The reason I did not notice at first is because I am about a foot and half away from computer screen and the characters looked like OK to me.  I never noticed this on my PS3 when I was viewing.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|I always remember this movie, but now after the new one I decided to watch again and it a hundred time better than the last one. The actors and actresses as perfect for their roles, much more convincing. Love it!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I knew the story od the miserable, but this production is just wonderfull great actors, great filming, loved the music!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|This movie was as good as it was advertised, although they could've applied more emphasis on Khan but overall, this was fairly a good movie. Since I generally purchase movies for not just the desire or popularity of the film, but for their clarity & sound. Star Trek Into Darkness did not disappoint. With the exception of the minor &#34;chuffing&#34; from my Polk Audio PSW-505 subwoofer that struggled to match the 30 hertz lows that the sound fields emitted. I will be purchasing a second subwoofer to counter this minor discrepancy. J.J. Abrams needs to kinda go back & view the past installments of the Star Trek movies in order to get a better grasp on what these movies were all about before he decides to take on another Star Trek film. Excellent cast from Zoe, to Zachary Quinto, to Chris Pine. Could not have cast together a more effective lineup. But my only issue is with JJ's vision of Khan & Star Trek as a whole. Overall, superior movie.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Great film. As always delivery of items through Amazon comes with no problems. This was a gift item and I can always be sure it will arrive on time.<br />Thank you!
B00B1ME3UO|4.0|I first bought this Tannhauser in my third year of college.  It's still overall very good and well worth the low price.  Someone, most likely unaware of this reissue, is selling the original Phillips pressing for a laughable amount.<br /><br />One distinct plus is its documentation of Anja Silja's voice in peak condition before it's premature downfall.  Too bad she chose to sing those heavy roles so early on.  Amazingly she's still singing low voice character parts, but never lost that wobble that she acquired in the late 1960's.  I saw her as Clytemnestra several years back and despite the condition of the voice, she dominated the stages with a gripping magnetism I've rarely experienced whenever she was on stage.  It was a chilling portrayal.<br /><br />The act II duet between Elizabeth and Tannhauser contains the usual stage cut (that deprives Wolfram of his touching and moving line) and though, after the Paris bacchanal, it reverts to the Dresden version,Tannhauser is given the usual solo at at \\"Zum Heil...\\" thereby depriving the listener of the beautiful ensemble writing that should surround it.  Solti, Barenboim, Haitink are the only recordings that come to mind that cut neither.  The Gerdes recording, gives T. the solo, but doesn't cut the duet; the Sawallisch Bayreuth recording with de los Angeles in the cast does the reverse as does the Sinopoli DGG recording.  I should mention that the Gerdes recording is often ignored, but is one of the best Tannhauser's ever recorded.  Nilsson does an outstanding job at both roles.  Another little known and surprisingly GREAT and complete recording (except for the \\"Zum Heil\\" solo is the 1936 recording with Carl Leonhardt.  Despite the age, the sound is excellent and the ensembles are balanced better than on most modern recordings.  The CD is hard to locate believe its on spotify.<br /><br />You should be forewarned of a weird and quirky cut unique to this production.  Though the final ensemble is not cut*, Tannhauser does not appear in the final ensemble.  I read years ago that it was to emphasize Tannhauser's alienation from the group.  However it is a typically ridiculous stage directorial decision and a grim forecast of the present state of affairs.  A gaping hole appears every couple of measures as he and Elizabeth's voices overlap at the beginning and end of their lines, but sing alone in the middle of their lines.  Tannhauer is thankfully allowed his final \\"Nach Rom.\\"<br /><br />*  There are a dozen or so measures toward the end of the final act II ensemble that has NEVER appeared in any \\"complete\\" recording and is only restored in the Barenboim's commercial recording and Thielemann's Bayreuth broadcasts.  This music only appears in vocal scores with the cut written in though I've never seen it in a full score.  It very well have been Wagner's own choice as it does lengthen the ensemble, but the music is probably the most harmonically advanced and most difficult to learn measures in the entire number.not appear in the final ensemble.

B00DEFW8YY|3.0|Looking back, how many women pianists have recorded either o Brahms's heroic piano concertos, which hover on the verge of being symphonies with piano obligato?  I can recall Gina Bachauer but no one else, not even Martha Argerich, whose explosive style is the closest model to Helene Grimaud's. As heard in concert, they both take charge and dare their conductors to keep up. In the D minor Cto. Grimaud gives us a remake from her younger years, and I had hoped that she would be better partnered than she was by a sleepy Kurt Sanderling fifteen years ago.<br /><br />But Andris Nelsons conducts the long orchestral prelude with a self-conscious slowing down for the second theme that causes it to sag (Grimaud doesn't follow suit when it's her turn to play the theme). I thought that Simon Rattle and Krystian Zimerman bent over backwards to caress every phrase and fussily tweak the first movement's forward motion. Grimaud and Nelsons are fully their equal, unfortunately, and yet in both cases the piano playing is tremendous. So is the recorded sound in a work where the orchestral part can sound congested. If only Grimaud and Nelsons didn't feel it was their job to lean into the mountain and move it with brute force. The unremitting grandeur of the opening movement of the First Cto. cries out for moments of respite and gracefulness. Compared to pianists who deliver the Adagio more naturally (Fleisher, Curzon, Barenboim, Pollini), Grimaud is more studied, which makes the movement seem to last forever.  The best thing here is the finale, where close-up miking of the piano lets us enjoy her effortless, even commanding technique.<br /><br />On to Vienna with the same conductor but a different orchestra recording the B-flat concerto in the studio. The famous opening horn call answered by the piano is done here very slowly - not the best start - and yet Grimaud gives us her trademark combination o powerhouse technique and personality. At her best she's exciting in her spontaneity, and when that's applied with passion, she can be a wonderful Brahms interpreter (as she showed in some of her earliest CDs on Denon when still a teen-age phenom). As in the First Cto., however, Nelsons tries too hard to sound \\"important\\" with the orchestral part, the last thing that Brahms needs - the music is monumental enough without underlining it.<br /><br />The restrained tempo of the Scherzo impedes forward motion once again, as stupendous as the pianism is, and the lurching slow down for the second theme emphasizes the problem. I'll confess that I had lost interest before the Adagio was halfway through. Wonderful as the VPO is, they seem to be putting one foot ahead of the other; nothing sounds emotionally engaged. In the tricky finale, Grimaud never runs the risk of sounding tinkly or anticlimactic. She could hardly be bettered, even though by this time the issue was more or less academic.<br /><br />DG's PR release boasts that Grimaud has sold 850,000 records for them, so this release will no doubt be a success, too, especially at a reduced price for two CDs. I count myself a fan, but these performances, as polished and gilt-edged as they are, didn't move me.  Among recent recordings, the one by Nicholas Angelich and Paavo Jarvi of Piano Cto. #2 demonstrates what real imagination and flair can do for a work that may seem stifled by its iconic status. There isn't much fresh air blowing through the present recording.<br /><br />P.S. - To hear what Grimaud is capable of at her inspired best, listen to the Brahms First Cto. from 2005 on YouTube - in very good sound - conducted by Michael Gielen.nd when that's applied with passion, she can be a wonderful Brahms interpreter (as she showed in some of her earliest CDs on Denon when still a teen-age phenom).

B00C7607BC|2.0|I've been thrilled with the beautiful blu-ray transfers of most of Disney's animated classics. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, a film over 30 years old, received such an excellent blu-ray upgrade that you can see the brush strokes in the backgrounds. Likewise, older films like Robin Hood have featured clean, vivid pictures. So I thought that surely The Little Mermaid, one of Disney's premiere titles, would receive a similar deluxe treatment.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />From the opening scene, the grainy picture that was so prevalent on the dvd is back in spades in the blu ray. Though most prevalent in underwater and nighttime scenes (and <SPOILER ALERT!> most of the movie takes place underwater,) even daylight scenes are afflicted by the occasional grainy sequence. Even character cels, which should be filled with flat color, often look like they're full of digital noise.<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that Disney could restore 30, 40 and 50 year-old movies to their original luster but not one of their more (relatively) recent hits. And they call this a Diamond Edition?<br /><br />More like Cubic Zirconia.

This converter does the job for my new laptop. Installation on Windows 7 was quick and easy, and it was recognized as COM5. I appreciate that it also works on Linux as well. Haven't tried MacOS.<br /><br />Plugable Technologies is a very responsive company, too.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|&#34;Winter of the World&#34; by Ken Follett - I bought the audio book.  My take on the first two books of this trilogy by Follett is that he has an interesting outlook on what human beings really are: including people who actually learn from their own experience and world and national history, have moral responsibility, and have a sense of decency and a capacity to love.<br /><br />I like Follett's easy to follow story-telling and his justifying expediencies: the &#34;At the time it seemed like a good idea&#34; attitude.<br /><br />My own assessment on the literary value of the work is that time will tell.  I do not know if these  two books of Follett's are destined to be classics of historical fiction, but I enjoyed them a lot.  I am eagerly looking forward to the third book of his trilogy.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|I don't normally read books like this myself. The show Castle wrangled me into it, like it did so many others. I put this book on like a warm sweater and didn't come out for little over 24 hours. It was well worth it.
B00004XPPC|5.0|I've seen this movie a few times and have always enjoyed it. William Holden, as he often did, plays the part of the reluctant hero which is so often true to life. He is able to escape imprisonment, engage in a short love story and then was more or less forced to join a group of commandos back to the bridge that his former fellow prisoners are building. I once read an article by someone whose father had been a POW in Burma and he hated the film. He didn't think it was realistic to his account and conditions were much worse than depicted. This sentiment is echoed by many sources. I seldom like artistic license over fact but this is a fictitious story that draws on many experiences of war and human responses to duress.<br /><br />The senior POW in the camp was a British Lt. Colonel played by Alec Guinness who envisions life beyond the war and wants to leave behind a legacy of British engineering superiority in the construction of the bridge. This is seen as collaboration with the enemy within the movie and unrealistic by British survivors who believe the French author based the character on French officers who did collaborate. Beyond the political aspects, the story bears some truth in the worlds that people manufacture to survive physically and emotionally while in captivity.<br /><br />Just enjoy the film and for days keep finding parallels to your own life and the world around us.
0062238868|5.0|Great read! I tend to read all of these autobiographies of special operations veterans, and this was by far one of the best reads so far.  Its amazing how much he survived while being down range, and unfortunate his life was cut short.
0062127241|5.0|bought the book for my wife. She really appreciated the book. She loves the Who and this is a great addition to her many items she has collected.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so fun to all of you despicable me fans or minion fans just remember to save those bananas and coin things whatever  they are called this game is so fun i dont even know how to describe it, it is seriously that fun..............
B000683VI4|5.0|10/02/2013<br />I'm sure that there are some who would not like this DVD. However, My wife and I really enjoyed it a lot. Our Granddaughter told  us about it  and after viewing it we just had to get a copy for ourselves. We are very happy we did.<br /><br />Bob
1401223176|5.0|Loved the art work. Great storyline. You get to see a lot of Batman's villains. My first batman graphic novel.  Plan on buying others soon. Suggestions anyone?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Well, if you're a Stephen King fan, I'd recommend buying this. I've read 90% of his novels, and this one makes me think of old school King. The Shining is my all time favorite, so a sequel was so nice to see. I don't want to go into the story, but it is definitely worth a read if you like King. And, spoiler alert of sorts...<br />So don't read the bottom if you're worried about that...<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />The ending wasn't as depressing as his last few books! That was probably the best part. The Kennedy book and Under the Dome made me cry, the endings were so sad.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|No spoilers.<br /><br />Fans of The Shining (I am talking about the book) could be a little upset with this story due to the fact that at it's core it is not a horror novel.  I would catogrize this novel as fantasy more than anything else.  Think of it as more of a Under the Dome type of story (the book not the TV show stay with me now).<br /><br />While I came into this expecting horror I was treated with a fantasy tale that did not fail to please.  In fact, what pleased me the most is who aspects of the Shining and Carrie were incorparated in this book and in a sense tied these two universes together.  There is no doubt in my mind that this book could continue into another book; however, I do see the next book being a horror novel. You will have to read the book to understand what I am sayng.<br /><br />I know Stephen King has always had an interest in writing fantasy novels and I was really suprised by where this book took me.<br /><br />Mr. King, you need not worry about the response to this book.  Your true fans, like myself, understand and respect this twisted little universe you have created.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|As an avid reader of science fiction fantasy, i will honestly say that i have not a read a book this good in a long time. Not to say that i haven't read any good books, its just that this one is so spectacular.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|My son watched this series religiously when it first came out.  I am finally able to watch it, and, I AM ADDICTED!!!  So many talented actors and actresses.  Very real situations and true-to-life plots.  I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!
0470876417|5.0|This layout and approach taken in the book makes it an effective tool for understanding the dynamics of your business and the factors that determine an effective business model.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I Love this game. I can't stop playing it.It is very addicting and makes you think a lot. Love it!
B000053VAZ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie for many reasons including the fact that I can relate to some of characters in it.
0061900656|5.0|When we were pregnant with my son and my daughter was just 1 years old she was fascinated by the simple and beautiful illustrations of this book and the very simple explanations of what a baby is and how it acts and what she can do to help. It is still one of her favorite books, and now that we have number three on the way my 2 year old son is lvoing his big brother book and is so excited about baby! My daughter was very prepared and excited for her brother and helped in all the ways the book described; I imagine my son will respond the same way to our newest addition :) So grateful for this sweet and precious little set of books!
1449410243|2.0|Not funny, very redundant. Obviously whoever wrote it was not very creative. I wish I had not wated my money. I can't even think of anyone to give the book to, becuase it were just plain stupid.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this app is soooo fun if im doing something and need entertainment this is just what I need whoever is questioning this app should definitely get it its no waste of time I love this app so much it is amazing!!!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Fun. is one of the most exciting and moving set of music that I've listened to in a long time.<br />The vocals and harmony is very strong
B00CTGVKGQ|5.0|So glad I was able to purchase this album!  Love it!  I'm jamming in my car everyday.  Can't wait to buy their new album!
1452110581|2.0|Not funny, not creative at all. I am sorry I bought the books. I could  (& have) written funnier stuff myself. Just plain boring.
B0009PAVI2|4.0|This case was very reasonably priced, and arrived right on time, and seems well constructed. The only reason I rated this item 4 instead of 5 stars was it's a little tough pulling a filter out when the case is full of filters.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I enjoyed the book because of my roots. I come from dust bowl immigrants myself. What a surprise it was to learn about some of the happenings, prejudices, and other information about some of the farm labor issues 70 plus years ago. In addition I reside in Kern County California and I know first hand where the labor camps were and still are.
B003YZU53A|4.0|Saw this on an international flight home. Loved it so much I had to watch it again - this is the extended version - otherwise it would have received the 5 stars. (I liked the version I watched on the plane)
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|I didn't like this movie, it was missing that authentic feeling of the original TV series and earlier films.  The brand needs to pay attention to what movie producers are doing, or else there will be no brand.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|She has done it again:)  Fantastic song and I cannot wait to hear the entire album.  Very talented lady.  This is a song that sticks in your head and just makes you want to move.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|The author has the ability to transfer his knowledge on a simple way.<br />Every argument is based on a study and is greatly describe.<br />great reading...
B004JMZPJG|4.0|Wel, case logic has a nice finishing in their entire products line. This holster is for my second camera, a T3 and it is ok for 18-55 lens. My 4 stars is for the bottom part. It is too smooth and I really don't think it will protect the lens from a drop. If the bottom was made from a hard material (like others models) it 'll be perfect. The holster has also lot of small pockets. Nice for filters, second batterie, money and this kind of stuff. I like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Right when I got it I was always playing the game. I think you should get this game. I know you will love this game I do. :)
0486282112|5.0|Wasn't the exact book I needed even though the numbers matched up but my teacher allowed me to use it
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Is a great collection, every MGS fan Must Have.<br />NES games are fine, PS games look just fine, but the PS2 are incredible.
B007CW2FCA|5.0|A perfectly recorded set of CD. Arrau's  interpretation comes out in all his greatness.<br />Enjoy this masterpiece, as it's worthwhile.
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|After reading several extremely good reviews about this series I had very high expectations for this book which were not met. It did not blow me away like a GoT, but it still had enough there to make me want to read the second book. The book seems to operate in spurts where nothing happens for a long time and then everything happens all at once. The world is interesting and I am looking forward to seeing how a couple plot threads resolve themselves. I did not like the resolution of events in the latter half of the book, but I'll say no more *spoiler*
B00CHVJODE|5.0|Awesome family movie!!!!  from my 17 month old to my husband of 33!!<br />17 months, 7years, 30 years, and 33 years!!

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I jumped on the Breaking Bad bandwagon a little late, but so glad I did.  One of the best series EVER!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very addictive game, can't stop playing it. not the most challenging game out there but just enough so to keep you climbing.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Each year is full of interesting situations and hilarious storylines. This season is a great one too! I would recommend purchasing this season if you too like the Big Bang TV series.
B004PA50JM|4.0|Terrific but flawed because of Mr. Stripes' consistent and obvious references to the band 's impending breakup. Is such self-consciousness necessary? That said the music is as good as anything they've done since &#34;New Adventures...&#34;
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just because this workout is short, doesn't mean it is easy!  I can hardly make it down the stairs afterwards!  I really like this dvd.  I can tell that the workout becomes easier each day, which is incentive it keep going!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I love Fringe.  It is everything the X-files was and everything the X-files wasn't.  Great chemistry between the actors and great story line from the start.  I've been hooked since the first show.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I love this item, I am very happy to bought it, great story, great condition, I dont' know what else to say , everything was great, thanks amazon
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I saw the reviews and was apprehensive about this Star Trek movie. I have been watching Star Trek for over thirty years and have gone to three conventions which gives me some idea weather this movie was great, good or indifferent.  While some of the reviewers have really zoned in on past references to earlier Star Trek's (Kahn), etc. the main point for me was the entertainment and writing aspects of the movie. In my opinion, this  is was a fantastic follow through on the Star Trek series. It combined elements from the past, present and future and had outstanding visuals which didn't get in the way of the plot. Great movie.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|The story has an emphasis on detailed planning and how surprises are handled.  Makes for an interesting plot.  Plus  a nice blend of good-guys (and gal!) and bad guys.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love The Walking Dead series and waiting for the new season to begin is driving me crazy. Now I can watch Season 3 and remain sane!!
B007CVZE38|4.0|Among Keane's catalouge, this is perhaps the one that one would call the most pop-oriented. That is not to say that it is inferior, just a different sound. Personally i initially found it to be a somewhat unwelcome change, but this album grows on you, and is only so when benchmarked against Keane's earlier works; it's still a cut above its contemporaries.<br /><br />Apart from the stronger tracks such as \\"Disconnected\\" and \\"The Starting Line\\", this album proves to be an easy listen throughout, with most bleeding genuine emotion through Chaplin's voice and the rest of Keane's accompaniment. Though as individual tracks they may not stand out as much as the well loved ones from Hopes and Fears and Under the Iron Sea, collectively this album is greater than the sum of its parts; an album true and true, to be listened end to end.<br /><br />I purchased the vinyl edition of this piece and though sonically decent, the vinyl quality itself leaves much to be desired. It arrived with deep, audible scratches and scuffs all over the vinyl itself. The cleaning machine helped but only to some extent. That being said, the general quality of vinyl, save for one or two spectacular releases, is rather abysmal.
B0064W65UM|2.0|So much has been saidthe  about V for Vendetta that I had the impression that it would be at the level of Animal's Farm. What a dissapoitment. There story is just OK and it does not lead us to deeply reflect about the life in society as Animal's Farm does.  It was hard to read it in my Kindle, the drawing did not come out good!
0345803507|5.0|This is a very exciting book,I couldn't put it down. I love the fifty shades of grey series! Fast shipping too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app was pretty good from the start. later on it gets more challenging but I'm one of those people that enjoy a good challenge so if you like a channelge this is good for you if not you'll hate it.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|takes too long to write  a few sentences. I'm deleting it from my Kindle Fire Too bad, as it could be a good program if tweeked.
B00DV3A84G|5.0|One of the best up and coming bands. I really respect their music. I preordered this album on amazon and received it on the day that it was released! The only drawback is that I wish it came with an mp3 download.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|The ending was a complete twist that was never seen coming.  Kept you guessing till the end and then still had another twist.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I love their enthusiasm, talent, and humor.<br />When can I buy more of their work?<br />Will the next DVD have Peponi?<br />How about some versions in  3D Imax ?<br />I like the combination of Video and CD.<br />I love watching the music being played and the fun of the videos.<br />Then I can see it in my mind when playing the CD in the car.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This little app has truly helped me clean up ask the excess junk that takes up memory on my phone!
0375413405|5.0|Her recipies are fantastic. She guides you through every step in the process. I have been a fan of hers way back when she was on TV. Can't thank her enough. My cooking skills are attributed to her.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The author admits in his notes that this new novel is a work of pure fiction more than usual and nothing said is based on actual events. With this in mind this unique and tightly drawn thriller features an African American as its main protagonist. \\"The Racketeer\\" is definitely a departure from Mr. Grisham normal legal novels. The story is more about reformation and revenge with insightful description of the legal and penal system.<br /><br /> Malcolm Bannister, a dubiously lawyer convicted of money laundering and serving a 10 years sentence in a federal prison. Malcolm continually proclaims his innocence and blames the FBI for his wrong incarceration. When Judge Raymond Fawcett is murdered along with his secretary he sees the ideal opportunity to use Rule 35 to have his sentence overturned. This scheme is the starting point for a long chase that keeps Mal's trickery a few steps ahead of the game......what follow is a cleverly orchestrated series of twists and reversals.<br /><br />The plotting is a complex scenario and every piece of the puzzle is held together with a strong narrative that never wavers. We have a satisfying and engrossing thriller with many enjoyable aspects: my preferred is how Mal's masquerading as an independent documentary filmmaker was able to circumvent the FBI.<br /><br />This is another page turner with excellent characterization delivered by an expert hand....
B007ZUTNF6|5.0|Great book. It was delivered on time and in good condition. I would recommend this book to anyone. It makes more sense than any I have ever read about Quantum Physics. A must read!
034580404X|4.0|A lot of it was unreal. No man that young would have made that much money. No man ever, could always get an erection when he wanted one. But the books held my interest. it was a page turner. I was interested in it until the end.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great totally worth it and a must buy if you need a good headset and cheap and easy to set up
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I finished this book I thought one thing:<br />It was simply great.<br />Exactly what I needed to read.<br />(:
140123755X|5.0|This is a great series of graphic novels. This arrived on time and is in great condition. I am crazy about all things fairy tale especially when they are done in cool and different ways like this. I'm very pleased with this.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|this author never disappoints.  another lovely long winding story that you cannot stop reading.  tears and sighs and heart touching....did not want it to end.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Good graphics and fun, I like how you can keep playing to build up the character, I've been able to pass multiple levels. Only thing that throws me off is reverse movement.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|We play on out tablet and my 5 yr old loves it. It was more to have something to do...
B00866APBO|5.0|very great for the price, flat and very detail for mastering.<br />needs at least 60ohm output and 200mw or a headphone amp
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|You can see why he is a talented singer and rocker.  A melodic beginning here of a one of a heart throb
B005Z271Y6|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Adele. But my wife loves this. She would give it 5 stars. After the Tenth time now, I'm getting to like it more. Adele puts on a good show.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|My daughter, Jessica, chose this movie. She LOVES it & she was SO HAPPY to order it from Amazon.com. At least once every 2 weeks, this movie is playing in our house! She got us saying, &#34;I do believe in fairies! I do, I do!&#34;
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really only have one word for this book amazing! I am not a huge sci-fi fan but I can honestly say I will be reading anything and everything this author has done and plans to do!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really good game.  Puzzles definitely make you think.  Lots of fun and very challenging.  Totally recommend to anyone who wants a puzzle that makes you think.  Looking forward to more levels - Soon please!
B002SQFZ68|2.0|Back when I was a kid, I had all his music. He changes some of his music here. I wish Bon Jovi would off played it like he did in the 80's/90's.
B000NA28HU|4.0|My daughter, Jessica, bought this movie, after borrowing it from the library TOO MANY TIMES! She has noticed how there are differences from this movie & the book. Each time she watches it, she calls out the differences. She still enjoys watching it, as she watches it every two weeks or so.
B00DYZ2YVG|4.0|I'm a fan of most zombie themed books/movies/TV and this particular book is no exception. Love the setting, Wales is such a unique place to set a zombie story. Great characters, and it stays legitimately interesting and thrilling throughout.
0143117009|5.0|I chose this rating not because it is easy reading but for the value of the contents. Diamond's knowledge of history and his ability to synthesize this with current conditions is spot on.  It's not an easy read because he provides so much information to ponder. I highly recommend this book to people who appreciate history and how circular situations/events are recreated over time to a detriment of humanity.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|If you're bored on your kindle and want to get this game. Go ahead. It's awesome iadmit. But after first time playing, it crashes. I really liked it and i am highly pissed. Stupid gameloft always screws something up from charges to bugs.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|Not as challenging as past ones. Ill defined progression. Can t tell if it is finished our if there is a way to advance to next level
1476727651|5.0|There are many reviews of this work and most of what can be said has already been posted here. But I can state that I enjoyed the story and that it is worthy of being called a sequel to \\"The Shining.\\"  The writing is excellent and there is less of the wordiness that has found its way into some of King's more recent works.  What else can be said that is relevant?  Read it and enjoy the characters that King brings to life and the story that keeps your interest to the end. \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is an excellent read.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Less than 3 RDJ for sure! He is the only guy that can make you love a narcissist (well besides Johnny Depp). Highly recommend watching this.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is an awesome bing game. I play it everyday. If you want a good bingo game to play this is for you.
0061906220|5.0|My Pre-3rd students all loved acting out the story and singing. They were able to use their imaginations as Pete and the rest of us stepped in all kinds of things. This story has high kid appeal and Pete always has a positive attitude. What a nice role model.
1400064287|4.0|Usually I tend to get loss over business book but this one has substance. It is written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell's but it is without a doubt better than his content. Gladwell would dance around a story while this one actually goes further in explaining the why.<br /><br />I took one star off because near the end and the last remaining chapters it gets to be a bit repetitive and thus I do not feel and significantly towards the value of it.<br /><br />There is however, a very good summarization of the content at the end and serves as a good guide.<br /><br />Well recommended.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Did not give me a volume boost, and in fact made the sound quality worse.  One of the worst purchases I ever made.
0156034026|5.0|What a nice merchandise! It is not only with good condition, but also with good price. Thank you so much.
B00915G6R6|5.0|Thank you this DVD of the good wife season 4 was just what I wanted and the price was great too . I love ordering my DVD s from you there is no hassle . Will continue to keep ordering from you  . . .
B00D3V5V7U|3.0|Black Sabbath was one of my favorite bands growing up; I grew up in the 90s but with a healthy love for classic metal like Ozzy-Era Black Sabbath, so you can imagine how excited I was that after a very long hiatus, the original group (with the exception fo Bill Ward) was releasing an album of brand new material.<br />I really enjoyed how much this album sounds like classic Sabbath; all the trademarks of the sound are there; bluesy grooves, heavy riffs, intricate guitar solos, powerful rhythm and thought-provoking lyrics. But therien lies the problem; as you listen to this album, which is by all means Sabbath doing what Sabbath does, you feel like you've been here before. The songs are great, but it's nothing new; and there's nothing here that grabs me. I am sure that Sabbath, at this stage of the game, can write their own ticket; they can probably take risks that other bands would never get away with and there is probably nobody telling them &#34;guys, we need a single.&#34; Which is why there really isn't one. There's no &#34;big songs&#34; here, which is a shame; because while it's a strong album and a bit of nostalgia, it has no teeth.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I just love this show. It is indeed just a show, but I love the idea of a bunch of intellectuals (mostly PhD's) in a comedy. It has even helped me get through my own process by taking the edge off of academic pressures. I can relate to a many things the characters go through and the laugh is much appreciated. :)
B001XUIBNO|5.0|Great noir film, Jack Nicholson is at his finest. This mystery thriller kept me on the edge of my seat.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Works great and gives me protection and piece of mind. The clear plastic protector went on easily with the tool they provided. I will definitely buy this again!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Everything about this book was off the chain awesome.<br /><br />From the lyrical, rich descriptions of the world & the magic surrounding it, to the plot & the complex make up of the characters.<br /><br />Dragos- This dude has me like...<br />*LET ME LOVE YOU!!!*<br /><br />I have to say he is the perfect blend of an Alpha Male/Paranormal Hero. He was never too much of one or the other. He was the perfect balance rolled into one. The make-up of his character remained constant & steady throughout the course of this novel.<br /><br />Pia<br />I love this chick. And the mystery surrounding her I thought was fleshed out well & revealed in just the right pacing. And the answers that came, did not disappoint.<br /><br />All the other characters, Villains included, were not only well written but intriguing for the most part. This whole world is intriguing! I was lost to it from the start of the 1st paragraph. READ THIS BOOK PEOPLE!<br /><br />I see that this is part of a series. While I don't have any interest to continue on with this series, (not interested in who the focus is for the next novel) I must say this is the 1st book to a series that I've read in a long while, that packs quite a punch. EVERYTHING about this book was on point & superb. So I HIGHLY recommend that you read it.
1401938906|5.0|I am a self-help junkie who definitely believes that thoughts create your experiences in life.  So, I was sold on this book before I read it.  It is a great read so far.
B00EU9BSNU|5.0|Its one of the best work of late Hans Zimmer. It was quite evident that he had the artistic independence to not to stick to any particular theme. I haven't liked an entire OST album since Bourne Supremacy. And &#34;Into the Red&#34; is right up there with &#34;Bim Bam Smash&#34;.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like the idea of being able to select how challenging (by number of pieces) I want the puzzles to be at the time I'm working on one.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|If you have a weak stomach don't watch this show (some visualized gore, some not), but if you are a fan of the books in particular &#34;Red Dragon&#34; this show is for you. Week after week episode after episode the show delivers the chills and the creeps. Just watching Hannibal's dinner parties is enough to creep anyone out. A strong cast helps make this prequel must watch TV.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Delivers every time! Be prepared for late nights. I just couldn't stop watching. I can't wait for the next season.
B00133MKVK|5.0|I saw Miss Bassey's knockout performance of &#34;Goldfinger&#34; at last years Acadamy awards and I was so interested in finding out more about her recent music endeavors. That's when I discovered this great collection of songs. Along with various producers and Miss Bassey's ever strong and soulful voice each song is so well done. With a strong dance/ club touch they are brought to life anew. At 72 it's amazing how strong her voice remains a powerhouse and a joy to listen to. Only wish I would have found this amazing collection earlier!
B0026PW67W|4.0|This Map is Cool and huge!! It's very detailed and you find something new on it everytime you look at it. It's a must have for any HP collector.
B001NHNG64|4.0|The second book in the series is a pretty good read (I read it in less than 2 days), a little far fetched and too convenient of a tie up but still a pretty good read. You can pick up a collection of the earlier books for a pretty good price so that might be a good place to start pay for 4 or 5 books for less that 2 kindle versions, and you'll have some pretty good reading to plow through.
B00CWVBV4E|3.0|From the reviews I really thought this would be a great movie for my kids (they love lego star wars).  My son loses interest quick and it really isn't too thought out of a story. My expectations weren't too high, but it still didn't even come close.  As an adult, it is relatively painful to watch.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|One of the best bingo games on my Kindle Fire. Fun to play and very addictive. I recommend it to all bingo players.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the book! Boyfriend and I read it together and I think it brought us closer together . There should be a fourth book!
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|In the context of things the soundtrack to the movie really does (for once) make the movie. Too many soundtracks today have nothing to do with the movie other than to sell the movie companies music division catalog. The score is haunting and atmospheric, and is a nice relaxation or wind down listen. That's not to say it's boring, it isn't, it's just something that lasts even after the titles roll.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|WUV THIS GAME AND AWESOMENESS. And now that I'm calm it really is an entertaining little piece of awesome. I think if you like minions you will love this game.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Easy to understand weather information with a beautiful background. You can customize it to your area, and check travel locations, or check the areas where your family lives. I love it.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|At times, my Kindle won't let the pen slide from one key to another, at which you have to use your finger for a little while, before being able to use the pen again. I like it otherwise, it's stylish.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|As the series goes on it becomes apparent, that you are watching the greatest zombie apocalypse based film work of all time (IMHO), and like all great shows ********SPOILER ALERT AHEAD********* (see the final season/episodes of Breaking Bad) no character is safe from death or injury, you know like in real life, where stuff happens to even the best of us. Shows without real consequences for major characters don't interest me. This show delivers on the promise of even the good have to go, and isn't afraid to take out anyone no matter how many fans love them or not. Story telling is front and foremost here, if it fits the story then off they go, no cliffhangers that always seem to rescue the major characters (Grey's Anatomy I'm pointing my finger at you and your plane crash, yes a couple of characters die but not one of the originals went anywhere). No Red Shirts here everyone is fair game. If you haven't seen the show from the beginning do yourself a favor check out the major streaming services and catch up quick it comes back October 13th.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|keeps me thinking and  on my toes  geomatericaly  keeps me away from the tv and all the stuff on the tube
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really sick people.  I read constantly and could find nothing in this book that held my interest.<br />I am not a prude, but rather go back to Lady Chatterly's Lover. Someone made a fortune of porn as usual.
0345529057|5.0|Just recently received the set. In process of reading and so far, I'm loving it.<br />Very excited to finish all four books.
1476727651|5.0|This book works brilliantly on several levels: Danny's redemption and recovery from alcoholism, as a crackerjack suspense, a supernatural scary thriller, with just enough vintage King gore and horror to please his long-time fans.<br />And finally, a classic tale of good versus evil with interesting and believable characters.<br />I loved it!
1401938906|5.0|I'm still doing the exercises. Not all &#34;worked&#34; but I'm confident that in due time everything will come to me as commanded. Book was delivered as promised
B009F89EW8|5.0|Jake Bugg is truly talented.  I love the throwback sound he has on this album.  A sound deserving to be heard on vinyl!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good game just takes awhile to renew energy to carry on playing so can only play a couple of games at a time
B00AIBZM40|2.0|Plot is thin, horror is of the creepy CGI variety, and relies heavily on the music. Very forgettable. Not worth purchasing.  Somewhat unintentionally funny at times which is death to a horror movie. Jessica Chastain's rocker character is not really believable. Swing and a miss.
1611748755|4.0|Interesting story, some clicks and lapses in recording were a bit disconcerting, but otherwise good listening. Would like to find other books about the same price.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|My Asus CM1831 comes with this processor. It works quite well - much faster than my dual core.<br />.<br />From my 33 years experience in building computers, I have used AMD and Intel. The former company provides better value. Its processors are reliable and \\"state of the art.\\" None has ever gone bad.
B00EEXST2K|2.0|The book was really good. The movie was not. They changed too much and left out Way too much stuff.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game. No glitches and easy to run. Have just recently started playing it, but so far it is a lot of fun. Some similar games force closed all the time. So far this one has no problems.
B0010358CG|4.0|I will say the only thing I didnt like about the movie was the villian and zombish way they had everythhing go down but other then that its characters look awesome! and character development is even better. the viliian is cliched but other then that its a 4 star movie!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I know Mr. King may not like the word sequel but that's my take on this book. It is an excellent followup to The Shining. You will get a real insight into some aspects of what a recovering alcoholic has to go through in recovery. Plus, of course, you are sharing in the life of Dan Torrance and how he has lived with his Shining. The characters are very well developed and create a wonderful, creepy and  suspensful story. A strong read for sure.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Great works really nice sounds good i've owned the other microphone this one seem to do the best job Love it great
0345803485|5.0|This is the most erotic , best written book i have read in a LONG time. Will read it again and I want to get the trilogy next!!!<br />I fell in love with Christian Grey!
B000F8O35U|5.0|will make a great christmas gift for my daughter and niece. Thank you so much, we all enjoy watching this movie!
1408842432|5.0|I loved this book!  I was sobbing after the first segment.  I especially loved the line where he talks about how we all have a purpose, but we don't find the purpose....it finds us and we often live life without knowing what that purpose was.  It was a beautiful account of love, loss and survival through it all.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Moriarity's style of character development caught my attention from the first page and kept me captivated through the unexpected ending.  That ending left me right where the author probably intended...contemplating personal parallels and &#34;what ifs.&#34;  I can't wait to read more of her work.
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|The new Jack album is amazing as always. He is back to his original sounds and its great music to escape to.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It was a great movie! It kept my attention all the way through. The little girl is really a good little actress, as well as all of the actors and actresses.
1848507836|5.0|I've been reading a lot of NDE books and this one captured my heart.  Moorjani does a great job of connecting with the reader, exploring her own truth and then choosing to live a different life after her experience by walking her talk. I Loved It!
B0000A5BSZ|5.0|Great movie and the only problem I had was Region 2 and playing it from my Panasonic DMR was not possible.  I thought I purchased the right copy for USA English region.
B005P06AAO|4.0|I love awkward, but dont know why they feel the need to bleep out every swear word especially on dvd??? Gets annoying
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is an Awesome Album, and a great evolution for the legendary Daft Punk!  I like pretty much every song.
B00ECL7ZJ2|1.0|I first saw Haim on Radio One's Big weekend 2013 and fell in love with them.  I couldn't wait for their debut album.  What a disappointment.<br /><br />This CD is so over produced that you can barely hear their voices through the mix.  The stupid drum machine, (where the hell is the real drummer?) is so OVER RIPE that it dominates all of the songs.<br /><br />I bet this would be an excellent album, if someone could remix it, bring out the sister's voices, get a real drummer and mix the damn thing the way it should have been done in the first place.<br /><br />Here's to hoping Haim's sophomore release will be much better than this piece of crap.  I know the sisters are very talented, but it's hard to hear it here.
B000BFH2S2|4.0|I liked the dvd and the cd,however I was disappointed that I could show the dvd on my tv. My dvd player said it would allow the dvd to play on my tv. I had to watch the dvd in my computer.  Not to cool.
B008M9PHWM|5.0|The greatest talent alive.
B00B9JDBSO|3.0|An o.k. album but no surprises and a few duds. Purchase with caution. One CD would have been smarter. &#34;Sometimes less is more.&#34;
B001HN6922|4.0|Great shipper. Great show. Our whole family loved it. Almost as good as the first  Disney always delivers good family entertainment
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had me thinking. Took an hour to pass level nine. Hahaha... Nice game. Keeps you occupied and great for kids critical thinking and problem solving skills.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|The Cd is great, good music and singing. I have really enjoyed it. Give it a try, you will like it.
B000SVZIGC|1.0|The plot, characters and lines are so pathetic that we laughed hysterically during the times that we weren't feeling sheepishly embarrassed on behalf of the actors, director and crew who invested effort into this mockery of a story.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great read. Truly gripping novel. I truly felt the pain and struggle of the characters. Well written novel for sure.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Buy it now, as others have said everywhere, it is a whole new offering, completely new material.<br /><br />Almost hard to believe that they didn't actually go back and re-record...... where did all the new sounds and material come from ..... David Botrill  !!!!!
B001TM14VC|5.0|This movie takes me back to my childhood, the now retired F-14 Tomcat was the biggest influence in flying. Great movie.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Great album, sounds like it should be played straight through.  the songs have meaning in addition to a unique sound.
B000AMJC2K|2.0|I just bought this product from Amazon. It arrived on time and was packaged great. But upon opening it to begin to put together for my 21in Asus Monitor, I notice there was no CLEAR instructions, Just pictures for you to figure out and follow. After, getting it clamped to my desk, the arm would not extend upward at all, the screw that holds this part of the arm was stripped out, I had to figure out what I needed to push to get the arm to extend upward and after finding that BIG round button on the arm, It took me squeezing with both hands and my fiance pulling it upward to get it to move even a little bit. I would not recommend this product to any one because it does not move or flex like they advertise on the site. Very hard to move around even with the set screws. I am thinking on sending mine back and getting a refund at this point.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|It was fun to watch, but I'd really have preferred an actual new story. I think this one was has been a bit played out. I guess, technically, that the reboot series has to reintroduce most if not all characters and places discovered on the five year mission, but I'd rather see most of those as subplots unless there's a really really cool twist. I really hope that J.J. doesn't drag us through the Klingon Soap Opera all over again. That got really old in the TV serieses.
B00EYE0ECW|1.0|no good. wants to force ads and install crap as default. deleted. looks like hack of google.<br /><br />go on by
B00DP94Z2W|5.0|really good!!! way better than any recent metallica.  sanfranish sounding thrashish.....hints of flotsam jetsam, with a touch of testament,blah blah blah...
0394818237|5.0|My 4 year old and 7 year old granddaughters were so interested they would not fall asleep...I had to stop reading.  So many occupations are explained in simple details.  the house contractors really amazed me.  Building a house was described down to the electricity, phone, furnace.  Lumber mills and paper mills.  Grain farmers and bread making.  Crops and stores. They took the book home before we could finish it.  next time I visit that's the first one I am reading to them.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|The diary of Anne Frank is still a major cultural touchstone, almost 70 years after it was written.  Even in the past year we've had controversies about Justin Bieber's ill-considered message left at the Secret Annex, or the \\"Hipster Anne Frank\\" Twitter feed.  And then, of course, there are always the Truthers, primarily neo-Nazi types, eager to claim that the entire diary was made up out of whole cloth after the war.<br /><br />This review is of [[ASIN:0553577123 The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition]].  The original version published in the US in the mid-'50s was edited by Otto Frank, Anne's father, who was the only Annex resident to survive the Holocaust.  That edition removed a lot of Anne's deeper thoughts about her own family and her own maturation process.  The Definitive Edition re-instates that material, but is still a combination of Anne's personal diary, and the version that she herself rewrote in the Annex in 1944 with an eye toward publication after the war (complete with pseudonyms).  There is also [[ASIN:0385508476 The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition]], evidently the unexpurgated text of her personal diary, which I have not yet encountered.<br /><br />The diary begins in June 1942, centering on Anne's school life and on the restrictions imposed on Dutch Jews during German occupation.  A month later, she and her family go into hiding, and are soon joined by the Van Pels family and, later, by Dr. Pfeffer, an ill-mannered dentist.  With eight people living in such a cramped space, personal conflicts soon emerge, and Anne chronicles these in great detail.  It's to Anne's credit (and she was only between the ages of 13 and 15 when she wrote) that she's able to view the conflicts from multiple angles - and, as the youngest person in  hiding, she was often the target of unwanted criticism from her fellow refugees, so her objectivity and empathy are remarkable.<br /><br />From the Annex windows, and from the reports of their non-Jewish helpers, Anne chronicles what's going on in the outside world - the forced disappearances of the Jewish population, the reports of concentration camps and death chambers, and the ever-so-slow liberation of Nazi-occupied territory by the Allies.  D-Day and its aftermath in June 1944 gives the Annex residents false hope, bitterly false hope, that they can outlast the Nazis and emerge from hiding.  At the same time, Amsterdam is literally starving under German occupation, and the warehouse and offices in which the Annex is housed is too tempting for burglars, so it is hard for their presence to remain a secret forever...<br /><br />For the first 18 months in hiding, Anne's diary is somewhat sparse, with many months containing only two to three entries.  Interestingly, the Franks and the other Annex residents were assimilated rather than observant Jews, and the diary spends more time discussing Christmas than Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur.  I don't think I'd been aware of that before.  About half the material in this version comes from 1944 alone.  Anne's musings on religion, the Jewish cause (in spite of her lack of personal observance), feminism, her own personality (she famous described herself as \\"a bundle of contradictions\\"), and her relationship with Peter Van Pels, the teenage boy in the Annex, are remarkably strong, and call out across the years to today's reader.  The destruction of her potential by the Nazis (she died of typhus in a concentration camp weeks before its liberation by the Allies) remains sickening.<br /><br />Even after 70 years, this remains one of the most important wartime chronicles, and one of the most honest, heartfelt memoirs, ever written.Jewish helpers, Anne chronicles what's going on in the outside world - the forced disappearances of the Jewish population, the reports of concentration camps and death chambers, and the ever-so-slow liberation of Nazi-occupied territory by the Allies.

B00E687MWQ|4.0|Satyricon were kinda gone for a LONG time, and I'm glad they've made their triumphant return. Also, when I say &#34;gone,&#34; I don't mean split or on hiatus. They have been touring a lot since &#34;The Age of Nero&#34; came out. What I mean by &#34;gone&#34; is no new material. So now that we're clear on what I mean, let me just say that this record is Satyricon, in every way. They set out to record what THEY wanted, the way they wanted, and made sure it was better than their last record. It's definitely just as good as the last 4 records.<br /><br />The song I find to stand out the most, is &#34;Phoenix,&#34; because this song does not have Satyr singing at all. In his place, is Norwegien singer, Sivert Høyem of the band Madrugada. It's a really interesting song to say the least. Personally, I love it. I think it could be a single. I think it could have a music video, or a lyric video at the very least. I think it's amazing, and I think it will find a place on many playlists.<br /><br />Listening to the first single, &#34;Our World, It Rumbles Tonight&#34; will give you a pretty good idea of the record as a whole. Not to say that the entire record sounds exactly the same, because it doesn't. It's a diverse and dynamic record, from one of the best bands of the last 20 years. The other stand out tracks to me are &#34;The Infinity of Time and Space&#34; and &#34;Nocturnal Flare.&#34;<br /><br />This album is just fantastic. It's a true masterpiece. Go get it!!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|You will not be able to put the book down It is fascinating and intriguing.<br />I think it is one of his best books
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I have been a fan since 1992 and say that I enjoyed every album since. I enjoy music because of the way it makes me feel or the emotions it elicits, not merely for it's musical mathematical complexities or sonic consistency. This release is the most relevant culmination of maturity, power, emotion, intelligence, complexity and simplicity that Dream Theater could have produced at this stage of their lives . To me this is most ideal blend of thinking and feeling five individuals could have recorded within each of their own experiences.
030759565X|5.0|I couldn't hardly wait for this to be published. Page after page of seemingly extravagant food, made up in a short amount of time, with little fuss, is sure to please everyone in the family. Kudos to Ms Perelmen !! &#60;3
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Not my favorite, but I enjoy hearing Josh Groban sing and  have a collection of his albums.  If you haven't listened to him, your missing out!
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Realistic story of collapsing kingdoms and the fight for ultimate one world order.  Hmm, sounds familiar doesn't it.  Acting is mostly convincing as we watch the fight for power or just plain survival.  Leaves you with cliff hanger after each section.<br /><br />Too violent for young family members imho.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So happy I read about this gadget, as we can now stream Netflix, YouTube, etc. through my Nexus 7 to our TV. We've already watched a movie and several old TV shows.
B00A9ET4MC|1.0|I just couldn't get into this book. I didn't care about the characters. It was moving very slowly. I gave up.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Never thinking I would enjoy heavy metal, my son introduced me to A7X years ago and have become quite a fan.  Hail Of The King is no different.  Like so many others I miss Rev and am grateful they continued forward as hard as it was for them to continue living the Rev's dream along with their own.  Love it and look forward to more in the future!
006224454X|5.0|I read a lot of mysteries, and I usually know the ending before I get to it.  Not this book.  It blew my mind.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Beautifully written, words and stories woven by a true story teller.<br />Real life complexities, no clichés in he ending. Magnificent.
B008MM9630|4.0|Wasn't sure what this game would be like..but I needed a new one to overcome my boredom with same old same old games.  So I tried it. It's cute and its laid back to me so you just kind of roll with it.  I like watching  the plants and flowers grow.  What is disappointing is you don't get much to start with and pretty quick they are wanting you to hit their store.  But I think more of the games put out now are like that...don't get much gameplay free to decide if you want to keep or delete.  But for now this is a keeper.four star game in my opinion.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Next time you're driving down a freshly paved road, pop this disc in and enjoy.  You feel like you're in Tron and you'll love every second of it.  The sound quality is fantastic and there isn't a single song on here I don't love.  Sometimes you need to turn your radio up a bit louder than usual to catch the beginning and end of songs but, overall, this is one of the best albums I own.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Love the soundtrack and the broadway play. I bought it on here for half the price of what it was at the show.
0451532252|5.0|The book arrived looking brand new like it stated it was.  Good condition.  Would purchased another one from this source.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. Have mastered the five grid, now trying to tackle the ten.  Would recommend this highly.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|This season is just as good as the first and, the best part is, the actors just keep getting better.  They really get into their roles and do such a fantastic job at making everything believable.  The quality is top-notch and I love it.  The fact that the DVD comes with the UltraViolet option just sweetens the deal even more.  I can bring Suits with me any wear, so long as I have internet.  I love it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|perfectly navigable, love the customized options for the interface and snooze, and the variety of wake up tones. definitely worth it over similar apps, and it's been consistently reliable from day one -- love it.
076115728X|5.0|Such a great book for anyone who has ever said, &#34;I messed up!&#34;  Offers creative solutions to problems that might otherwise stop us in our tracks.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|This doll is absolutely beautiful! I am amazed at the detail and quality. Very rare doll! My daughter is going to be thrilled! Every MH fan's must have for their collection! I recommend Amazon to everyone who collects! You will not be disappointed! For the price, fast delivery, and premier customer service; you cannot go wrong! I am thrilled with my purchase!
B0084IHVC0|5.0|The quality is fantastic and I love the sing-a-long editions that come with the movie.  It's cute and rather paw-esome.  It's a great buy for a great movie.
B0093ICOJ0|5.0|Really good a real cliffhanger, couldn't have been better, not disappointed, Apple souls weary of squirrels and further more chickens
6305692572|5.0|Gave this as a gift to an addict.. She loved it and felt like it told her story. Thank you!
1476727651|5.0|Sadly, I have never read The Shining. But I'm familiar with the story from having seen both movie versions and was eager to see what happened to little Danny Torrence.<br /><br />I loved this one! Danny's story and struggle with alcoholism was heartbreaking and amazing. I loved the character Abra. Gifted just like Danny. She was so fun to read about. Sweet but so very fierce.  The True Knots, were interesting part of the story, but really creepy. I'll never look at folks in RV's the same way again.  Doctor Sleep was an excellent read. Dark, creepy and exciting. Really everything you expect and hope for from Stephen King.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Dream Theater has switched gears to focus their musical prowess on writing awesome songs.  The focus on structure and melody is very apparent in this album.  I am a fan of the technical side of Dream Theater, but it is much more rewarding when they solo/jam over powerful songs.  This is a must buy for all Dream Theater fans.
B00B5ACNRM|5.0|I know batman was a really epic flick really great I don't know what else to say here so refrigerator
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I have lost weight by the help of this device. It is easy to use this product. Thank you. MCE
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This entire series has been one for the books & this season was no different, great performances & amazing effects!!! If you read the graphic novels & are even considering purchasing the show to catch up, stop thinking and do it!!! You wont regret it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very addicting and lots of fun.  Just like a carnival game.  Lots of prizes to win and levels to achieve. Wish there were more free coins. Have been trading in all my prizes but will try to save them as a previous reviewer suggested.
1936608898|5.0|Really opens your eyes to what you are feeding your body. I have only been starting bits of the program and will in full throttle soon. Very enjoyable book to read very informative.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculator app I've downloaded! Use it often, never crashes!<br />Great work! Download it now, you won't be sorry!<br /><br />Awesome!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great as usual by Stephen. One of those lose sleep can't put it down books. The movie should be killer!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved this book!!! I now need the third to see what happens. I would recommend this book to everyone that loves books!
082300659X|5.0|My copy of this book just arrived -- complete with CD in the back.<br />Between this and the Charles Barque course, I have lots of material now for self-education ... I bought these based on a number of reviews and because I want to focus on learning to draw the human body well. I live in an area where classes and live models aren't a possibility ...  I believe these will give me what I need to continue learning and growing as an  artist.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Don't expect The Shining Part II.  Instead it's a thrill ride all it's own with new monsters to haunt your dreams.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Real fun good brain activity game<br />Gets you thinking but also suspenseful wondering what picture you unlock next. Very entertaining.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It just works.  What else can you say?  Works across devices and it is convenient to have your books in the cloud.<br />The only thing that would make it better is to remove the dadgum DRM on books to allow me ot actually OWN them instead of the perpetual rent with the Sword of Damocles ready to drop the severing of my ownership.
B004K00NEO|5.0|My wife and I just love this movie. We like robots a whole lot. Thanks for sending it promptly. Very happy.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is a hilarious movie that I would highly recommend, especially since Halloween is right around the corner! It would be perfect for kids ages 7 and up.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The Emmy's may have ignored them but the viewing public doesn't...well written and acted and better than most of the junk offered out there and awarded in TV land!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Yes, it is working fine and I will be upgrading to a paper white soon. Lousy that is broke in the first place.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Get survival craft it has better graphics plus I did the math and it has 12x the items also it saves you money minecraft is 6.99$ but survival craft is 2.99 the best part is survival craft has a never ending world minecraft world's ARE very small. So get survival craft. (It is my option so deal with it)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD is amazing. I can't stop listening to it! Makes me want to see the musical over and over again!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I finished this book in three days! Very moving story about family, endurance, and integrity. The hardships the two main characters go through are horrific, yet they maintain their good nature and strive hard to overcome their difficult situations. Very touching story with a great plot and a happy ending.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Best show on TV.  The cast is great.  The story line is ah-maz-ing!  Even my boyfriend is hooked! This won't disappoint.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book!  I was distraught when it ended so abruptly so I ordered the next one just for it not to be released until January...UGH...LOL.  I can honestly say I read this book word for word.  It was wonderful.  Although a childrens book, I was captivated by it's story line.  Fantastic!
1476712042|5.0|I loved this story...Can't put it down once you start.  Read both in a couple of weeks.  Will not be disappointed.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I saw some of the previous comments on this and since getting it in hand, I have no issue with anything on this.<br /><br />It is well made and well designed and just perfect for when I go out in the woods with two cameras.<br /><br />No complaints with this unit at all.
0399226907|4.0|this is a classic book.  Durable for a baby and a young toddler.  Nice addition to any library for a kid.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Seems to be a nasty old cat except when you scratch his ears then he might still bite you he is kinda cute when he smiles
B0007CYW5A|4.0|I am a professional videographer and have used SONY cameras that take the SONY L-series batteries for many years (PD-170, Z7U, NX5).  Genuine SONY Lithium Ion L-series batteries are excellent purchases.  They are more expensive than most.  But usually you get what you pay for in battery technology.  I have purchased cheaper non-SONY copies of the NPF970.  I have also purchased what looked exactly like SONY NPF970s (except they didn't have the &#34;SONY&#34; brand name).  All for cheaper.  A few of the copies performed well, many did not.  Some have failed miserably.  Weekend and occasional videographers can get away with a cheaper copy (as long as you have a backup).  However, if you want reliability, all the time, for extended shoots, and can afford it, I would recommend genuine SONY NPF970 batteries.
B009FXIICK|3.0|This game is like bejeweled, with less features.  Match up 3 of the same objects in a row and they disappear.  But after you get past the first &#34;break&#34; (I think it's 5 levels). it get significantly harder.  the countdown clock moves significantly faster.  to the point where I just give up after that.  At that point, I'd rather play bejeweled.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|another great story populated by a sympathetic and believable protagonist along with a wonderful mix of characters. Highly recommended to everyone.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Ben is a treat for all ages .my great granddaughter and I had a great time laughing at him. He is easy to enjoy
B00F35B8F8|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  We are fans of the original series as well.  Now our kids are getting into it!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|A very good puzzler.  You have to pay attention all the way to the end.  Great acting and cast. Keeps you on your toes.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show.... is addicting!!! Can't wait for the remaining of season 3 to be out. Very interesting show.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like this app because I us it for home work I really recommend a different calculator app though by<br />American people who are not allowed to make out or have  sex have<br /> a good time
B00942Y4IY|3.0|The first 35 minutes I would give 4.5 or 5 stars then the film falls off.  It is a shame that the rest of the film does not keep pace with the first 35 minutes.  But still a fair film to watch
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Love this rootsy side of Sheryl Crow and her new CD \\"Feels Like Home.\\"  The title says it all!  FIve stars all the way.

B000E5N6LG|4.0|Being an Arizona Male, I grew up with hearing and reading about Wyatt Earp.  My Great-great grandfather was a &#34;2 gun&#34; marshal from Kansas, so I had stories from my older maternal family about Wyatt and his kind, (Hickock and others).
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Fleetwood Mac is just one of those bands that other aspiring artists and groups &#34;Dream(s)&#34; (sic) about being...Successful to the point of almost excess, talented to the point of &#34;come on, how will they ever outdo this song/album!&#34;, and all around excellent songwriters and performers/musicians...They &#34;wrote the book on&#34; what it takes to be a real &#34;supergroup!&#34;
B004EPYZSK|5.0|When I heard this title I laughed. Butt when I saw the movie I changed my tune. This is really a well writen tale.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Some of the original plot elements have been rewritten but on the whole this follows the book cloesely and works very well. Props must be given to Hugo Weeving for taking a part where his face is never seen. Not many actors would undertake the anonymous part and put in such an inspired performance. Natalie Portman, beautiful and skillful as always, makes you forget that her character was originally only 15. All in all, a fabulous, visually stunning movie. Highly recommended! anmmmmmmmmmmmm:::
0061733199|5.0|One of the best survival books I've read for some time now.<br />Very well put together<br />Lots of information<br />Lot of scenarios<br />Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a survival book!!!
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable movies I've ever had the pleasure to watch. (And I've seen it quite a few times!) The director, Kat Bigelow, did a superb job with what many directors would not even attempt to handle, just for the sheer reverence that the Beatles music holds in the hearts of those who know and love them and their music! It is simply a great story with great music that will thrill and captivate all Beatlemaniacs and even entertain those who aren't real die-hard Beatle music fans. I highly recommend this film for music lovers and fans of &#34;love stories.&#34;
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Steven Pressfield tells it straight with glaring clarity.  His insights will resonate with the troubled soul who knows there is more to themselves than they allow.<br />Read it. Think about it. and start practicing your gifts!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love the graphics and design. I play this everyday and I love my minions in their little costumes. Gotta go time to get some bananas.
0345533666|5.0|This novel was so engrossing, so disturbing, so haunting, so real, that after I finished it I had difficulty picking up a new book. It is really cross-genre between a crime novel and a literary novel.
1612931103|5.0|I used this in college myself and I am now about 70 years old.<br />I bought it for my granddaughter in high school.<br />This is the most basic and classical reference for English grammar<br />that anyone can find.

B0053EZXRS|5.0|If ya like Nicholas Cage ... you'll live this movie and especially the ending!!  Action filled with a twist you do not expect??
B00005ATQM|5.0|I won't go into the Black Album pro's or con's. This album I feel is one of, if not their best. However, that's for each listener to decide. If you can, listen to the DVD-Audio version and I can bet you will change your mind about the perfection that went into the mixing and production. It sounds as if you are there in the studio. I have mostly CD's and about 30 DVD-Audio discs. There is simply no comparison (not even SACD) as to the quality. There are a few car makers, mainly Acura, that come from the factory with a fantastic DVD-Audio surround system. Please don't think you can buy the disc and put it into a CD slot; it won't work, and at about $35-$80 a disc, don't waste your money unless you plan to invest in a true DVD-Audio system for your home. Due to the expensive production costs and the disc costs this format never really took off and it's a real shame. Music never sounded so good.<br />This album in this format, changed me from a Metallica fan to a huge fan with a tremendous respect for all the work they had to put in at the studio.<br />Great Job!!!
1451695195|4.0|It's such a wonderful argument for our spiritual selves.  I keep repeating the three statements he says he learned -- when I'm tired or afraid -- and they are comforting!  The book ended very abruptly, tho, it seemed.  I would have liked to hear more about how he felt long-term and problems he encountered.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|This is probably the best spoof ever made for Star Trek fans...Yes, Spaceballs is an excellent sci-fi spoof, but no other movie captures the fandom of Star Trek like this one does.
B00170MYIS|5.0|I needed a spare battery for my camera. This battery has worked perfectly. It was a very good value compared to buying one at a big box store.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is the amazing story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor black woman who, when stricken with cervical cancer, had her cancer cells taken from her without her knowledge or consent. Since her death in 1951, these HE-LA cells proved to be incredibly strong and long lasting, aka immortal, and have led to numerous advances in medicine over the years.<br /><br />This book recounts Henrietta's life story, with a particular emphasis on her medical condition, as well as that of her family, who never really understood what had happened and were totally shut out of any profits arising out of the use of her cells. Also of interest is the challenges the author faced in dealing with Henrietta's family in the writing of this book.<br /><br />However, the book goes on to address numerous issues in medical ethics. Though the privacy issues raised in this situation have been legally clarified, most people still do not have any legal rights to any tissue taken from them during testing and/or procedures.<br /><br />Though disjoined at times, this is an amazing book with an incredible story.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|There has been a ton of bashing of \\"After Earth\\" that most likely has to do with it being popular by some to immediately hate any M. Night Shyamalan film and/or any project that involves Jaden Smith as being a vanity project.<br /><br />Let's strip away all that nonsense and just review the film!<br /><br />I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan, and no, I haven't rated all of his films a \\"10\\" or \\"5 stars\\". Same for Will Smith. I figured I'd get that out of the way first and yes, I am an actor that has worked on two Shyamalan films (not this one).<br /><br />On to the film...<br />Visually, I found \\"After Earth\\" to be a beautifully shot film with lush landscapes, interesting special FX and some interesting, new elements like the changing colors of the suit Jaden Smith wears. Any sci fi fan should love the visuals. Couple that with a great score and editing and from a technical standpoint you have a winner.<br /><br />Shyamalan's directing is right on point. The story was written by Shyamalan, Smith and Gary Whitta and focuses on the relationship between a stern military man (Will Smith) and his tentative, but eager to please son (Jaden Smith). You can tell from the story that though the father loves his son, he wants more from him instead of accepting him as he is and that the son doesn't really want the military life, but feels it will please his father. He also feels responsible for the death of his sister by a dreaded \\"Ursa\\". Both characters are written with internal conflicts regarding the other. As with all Shyamalan films, this is really about coming to terms with a strained relationship through an extreme cicumstance.<br /><br />As for the acting, Will Smith does not play to type here. There are no jokes. He is not the action star and the only time the stern appearance breaks is when he is with his wife and at the end of the film. It's a nice change.<br /><br />Jaden Smith is the lead of this film. I personally think his energy, reactions and facial expressions are really good and based on them I believe his performance. I think what myself and others want to see from Jaden is better delivery of his lines. With some work on his dialogue he will get there. I will agree that he's not there yet, but I think he has the ability. Acting is a constant learning experience and work will yield improvement.really good and based on them I believe his performance. I think what myself and others want to see from Jaden is better delivery of his lines. With some work on his dialogue he will get there.

B008DBF5Z8|5.0|By combining this with a Bamboo tablet, they turn a plain dry erase (white) board into a Smart Board! Wonderful!
0529064847|1.0|Some of the pages were up-side down. Very poor workmanship. People did not their job right. I am very disappointed with the purchase.
B004RUF022|1.0|I just got it and all cds has its tags in chinese. I already unpack it, so cannot return. Can we at least make Cds in US. Very disappointed.<br />Just taking back my words about return. Spoke with customer service and got return authorization. Amazon service is excellent. Cannot say same about product

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the bonus and daily free play if I didn't have a life I could play all day enjoy it very much
B00FITRTQ6|5.0|Purchase done on Amazon.it<br /><br />This is not a simple crime book, but THE typical crime story: interesting, realistic, and the haunt of the guilty is not surely obvious at all.<br />The story is not too long (less than 100 pages) but lets you completely enter in and feel the atmosphere of Tursenia.<br />All the characters are well described and reported and you can almost see them as real people, with their merits and their faults. It is really easy to cheer for one or the other.<br />If you have read \\"Cutting right to the Chase\\" you'll definitely love this book too.<br />Now I can say, without any doubt, that Stefania Mattana has entered rightly in my top 10 best writers! And the waiting for her next book is just started.
0345529057|5.0|Fair quality for the price. I have not met any printing problem so far. I would recommend buying it if you just want to read the first 4 book of the song of ice and fire.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best game in the world don't listen the the it freezes  it works perfectly fine .
0375869026|4.0|Great book, it is on the reading Olympics list for children to read. It is a really good book. I was very satisfied.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I thought I was buying this to reinforce Vince for doing this classic country, and thought I would probably miss Merle's voice doing his music, but Vince and his musicians have done such a great job on this new cd, I've listened to it over and over and am enjoying it every time.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This whole movie is hilarious. The cast is phenomenal. If you want something real funny then get this to add to your dvd collection. They have a black and a white version. Both are very funny. I do have both.
1400052173|5.0|Loved this book. It was a great read with historical value. Passed it on to my daughter who is a librarian
B00FEN000S|4.0|What's not to like?  Giant robots vs. modern Godzilla's, sweet!  Don't get into this movie unless you have the ability to latch on to the monster movie genre.  Seriously, this is a summer b-buster flic, so don't expect a lot of depth and character development.  Do expect fun special effects and pop-corn eating color between the lines plot.  Makes me wish I had an iMax in my living room :-]
0062265083|5.0|This was an excellent book and is a must have for any Gaiman fan.<br />Quality is excellent and I would highly recommend it!
B004LWZW9C|5.0|a good movie to watch. Add this one to your collection. You won't be disappointed.  I would recommend this highly.
0525478817|5.0|I bought this book at my daughters recommendation. We both love books and try to read the same books so we can compare thoughts. First book I have read in 24 hours in a long time!
B00847KFDS|3.0|I thought the premise of this album sounded promising, though the whole &#34;duets&#34; album thing has grown tired since Sinatra did it a couple decades ago.  I also think John has mined his CCR music once too much now despite the fact that I loved his Creedence performances on previous albums.<br />I'm sorry, John, I feel like a traitor, but I'll be there for the next album and the next concert.  Just leave the duets behind. okay?
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book because of the immense detail that the book contained. I could picture everything that the book described. I would give it five stars everyday and any day.

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|To go from a 100% anti-zombie anything to being 100% a &#34;Walker Stalker&#34;!  The Walking Dead isn't just a story about the zombie apopcalypse, it's about the strength of the human race and the willingness to do whatever it takes to protect your family.  This show has action, it has gore (if you like that stuff - there's plenty), but most of all it has heart.  The gut-wrenching losses the main group, under the leadership of Rick Grimes, suffer only power the group to do better - to hit back, to let new people in, and to recognize that in a world overrun by the reanimated dead, you need to hold on to your humanity - and the people who remind you of it - with every last breath.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I have loved Bob Dylan and his music for nigh on fifty-years  now..., well, excepting for most of that unfortunate late seventies foray into religion.  This compilation, which includes &#34;New Morning&#34; alternate selections along with those from Dylan's &#34;Self Portrait&#34; album, are a happy addition to the collection.<br />What can I say about the music that hasn't already been written by those more musically literate than I am?  All I will say is that I love this collection, I love the &#34;Bootleg&#34; series, and I love Bob's continuing recording legacy.  I await further releases with bated breath.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game, my kids live to play it also! It's very entertaining. As soon as I discovered the app and started playing the kids were interested and immediately downloaded the apps on their ipods
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was very eager to read something different of J.K.Rowling's because I had loved the Harry Potter series. But I have to say I was quite disappointed in this novel. All the characters were depressed and unhappy at the beginning and they were all pretty much depressed and unhappy at the end. There is some character development and some unexpected turns but I kept waiting for something to happen to change something in this town of sadness. But sadly, it never did.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I have a lot of stuff and I really don't like chugging papers and pictures around with me where ever I go. That's why I use this app. I only wish that Amazon would really make this app available for Kindle Fire users instead of us having to download it from a different site.
B00D1X0576|1.0|Was advertised to work on Kindle Fire.  Did not ever work.  I tried to reload it 4 time.  It never worked.  Don't wast your time.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book.  Couldn't put it down.  And I was sick to my stomach with each page turn.  Wow. I really loved this book!!!!
B00CATONCA|5.0|Amazing detail. Exceptional product! This is definitely a topic of discussion at<br />every party I have because I display it happily.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|does not do anything at all.. was supposed to adjust EU but nothing, using samsung s3 for verizon with RootBox latest rom (10.2.13)
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|Great watch, keeps excellent time. The white face version is a bit hard to read as the numbers and dials are white. I bought it for its large face (I have aging eyes). I should probably have bought the black faced version instead. One day I hooked the dial knob on something and it came almost completely out of the watch? I pushed it back in and it stayed. All in all, I'm pretty happy with the watch. It's a nice looking timepiece.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I had several people tell me that I needed to see this show. When I saw that it was on sale I could not resist buying it. Oh my, I was delighted with this little gem. Richard Armitage gives an unforgettable performance.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|If you are a fan of Star Trek, or even slightly entertained by science fiction, you'll love this movie! The plot thickens and widens from the last one, the characters come into a more mature role, as their relationships with each other grow in mutual respect and loyalty. Great film. Beware: this film is in letterbox edition, so if watching it in a narrow frame bothers you, look for another version.
B008EKON56|4.0|The unit works well, and sound is better than with headphone out alone.  Also charges the iPod while in use.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|I just got this in the mail today. And its simple stunning. The drums sound amazing, You can hear the bass guitar very clearly as well the double bass drums. James voice sounds really good on this album and he doesn't over extend it. A lot of growls as well. No hi pitch straining of the voice or going through the motions he really delivers, awesome voice! Lars sounds fantastic on the drums, a great sound. This by far the best sound of live songs I've ever heard. So well produced and mixed. The sound just blows out of your speakers and the thumping of the bass is to me fantastic. I give this album a perfect 5 star rating. Well done, now I hope their next album sounds this good. A must have, highly recommended. If your on the fence about buying this go ahead and buy it!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|enjoyed the movie watched it on my 60 inch tv the graphics were excellent. had friends over to watch it again.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I saw a couple of episodes on TV before I began reading. I am enjoying it; but it would be better to purchase the whole series than to borrow e-books. The plot gets intricate and I lose track of who is on what side - seeing how they change sides and there is much betrayal.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|A very fun and addictive bubble pop game. Give it a try and you will get hooked. Fun for all ages from 5 to 95. Just wish I had more time to play it. Have fun.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|if you like anger birds, you need to add this to your collection.  full color , brilliant action, need lots of skill to get 3 stars...fun, fun, fun...

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Installed with no problem and runs great. I think it is the best and may be able to show family pics with out down loading to web.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was taken aback by how good this show is. The plot line is a little cheesy and far fetched, but you can't help but root for the actors. Each of the characters compliment each other and it makes for a good tv show.<br /><br />Harvey comes of as cool and smooth as the Dos Equis guy too.
B000001FYL|5.0|Older cd, but there's not a bad song on it. Jon Bon Jovi at his finest. Goes great with a great movie
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and hop there is another one. I would like to know what happens to them.
1451626088|5.0|I have been dealing with ancestry.com and my daughter's husband is related to the Woodville's, Warwick's and the Tudor's.  I have been reading as much as possible about these families.  Philippa Gregory's historic novels with all of her research have given me more insight into these people.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome! If ou want to turn your tv into a smart tv get this. Also if you ever want to share web content (from chrome) in a room with friends this is perfect. Use it in a house with 4 housemates and it has been an amazing buy so far.

0307352153|4.0|This was recommended to me by a clinical psychologist who thought I would enjoy it.  I am about 1/2 way through it and it is very informative, but not what I had hoped.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Vapor Trails is one of Rush's finest works. It remains very experimental for them, with no keyboards, multi-layered vocals, and deeply personal lyrics. The instrumentation is mostly driving and grungy, and yet the vocals are melodic and moving.<br />Standout tracks:<br />GHOST RIDER: Vocals are so naked, so lonely, so raw, much like the mood they are trying to convey.<br />NOCTURNE: Huge improvement in dynamic contrast for this song that moves between sweetness, chaos, and mystery, just like dreams do.<br />PEACEABLE KINGDOM: Can hear the different layers of perhaps the best song on the album. Bass lines that were buried spring to life on this one.<br />5 stars.
1452126577|5.0|I well written humorous book. Highly recommended! Adorable pictures, word searches and games, and even a useful recipe for a litter box cake!
B00000K2VZ|5.0|Hearing this CD reminds me how really, really good Janis Joplin's voice was. Nuanced, evocative--the maturity in her singing is so evident--and makes me saddened yet again at her early death.
1416595236|5.0|So Sorry Vince Flynn is no longer with us.  I have enjoyed everyone of the 12 novels in the Mitch Rapp series.  Vince was a great story teller and his writings will be missed.

0399255370|5.0|I HAVE NEVER TAKEN THE TIME TO WRITE A REVIEW BEFORE BUT THIS BOOK WAS WORTHY OF ME TAKING THE TIME TO WRITE.  THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CHILDRENS BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ IN A VERY LONG TIME.  MY BOYS, AGES 4 AND 8, ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.  WE WERE ALL LAUGHING OUT LOUD WHILE READING IT. VERY CREATIVE AND A MUST READ FOR CHILDREN!
B00EP0KYDO|5.0|Plain and Simple, this is an excellent movie.  If you are looking for mindless destruction, unreal explosions or overdone space battles, go somewhere else.  If you are looking for a modern classic Sci-Fi in the style of Moon or Oblivion, this is it.  I cannot understand how this movie bombed, but 2001 and Fantasia did as well.  Beautifully wrenching and touching scenes and one that REALLY creeped me out with possible nightmares which is saying a lot for someone who reads H P Lovecraft for bedtime stories.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|In general the book was well written but a bit boring at times. I hope the next one is more interesting.
B007P06DOK|5.0|As soon as the PBS special on the making of Graceland ended, I was on-line ordering the CD.  I have the original release on a cassette tape.  Learning the entire back story made me want to hear the music again as I understood so much more about what influenced Simon's lyrics.  If you are too young to remember, get this CD and then learn what was going on in Africa when Paul Simon was creating this music.
B000SEI230|5.0|But Nickolas Sparks 're-invented it in the finest detail that people have craved since then.  Tasteful love scenes that describe and tell just enough to power the readers emotions make you remember the wonderful loves and romance of your life.  Those untapped memories flood back and you relive with Sparks characters the richest and most passionate times of your life.  Sparks always has unexpected twists in his novels, his trademark surprise endings that he has the exclusive patent on in today's fiction field.  No one else compares no one.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A lot has been written about Lincoln's rise to the Presidency from his humble origins.  This was a great comparison to the men who were also in line for the job and how Lincoln used their skills to help him govern.  He sought their advice but was always in charge.  I learned a lot about the behind the scenes decisions leading up to and through the Civil War.  Reconstruction would have been so different had Lincoln survived.
0762445262|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Bat Signal. It's mini like it says, but the light is maximum! You can't see it during the day or in a bright room but why would you want to? It's the Bat Signal, it's optimal effectiveness is at night. In a dark room this light makes a bat siganl so bright, you'd swear the Bat-man is going to show up. I didn't care about the mini book so I have no input there. but this was definitely my type of collectible & any Bat Fan would love it.
1401938906|5.0|I tried all the experiments, only one didn't work but I am still working on it, interesting approach to an old subject.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandson enjoys playing games on my kindle when I go to visit him.  It entertains him for hours after school..
1423140605|5.0|The daughter and I love this series.  Rick is a good writer and tells a very interesting tale.  Can't wait for the next book.
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|JUST A TERRIBLE MOVIE OF TREMENDOUSLY BAD ACTING AND ANOTHER FLOP BY THIS FATHER AND SON TEAM FEEDING THEIR EGO'S!!
B00AEUPOVQ|3.0|Typical classic lit film.  Well performed. Great when you in the mood for something &#34;light & serene&#34; to view.  Worth a look
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My grandson enjoys playing on my kindle when I go to visit him.  It entertains him for hours after school.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It shows true to life human situations and backs up the old saying &#34;What goes around comes around&#34;. Don't forget to count your blessings!
0553801473|5.0|Great book and series.  Couldn't wait to get the book and had a hard time putting it down once it arrived.
B004T4KKSA|4.0|In many regards this book deserves a big 5 star rating. Do you want to grasp how we got where we are today? Do you want to be informed before jumping to any political and idealogical opinions? Then you would serve yourself well to read this book. I did however subtract a star for not being pithy.<br /><br />-cons: This book could be condensed. There are many sections that become more lengthy than they really need to be.<br />  IT feels a bit aloof in an effort to be objective. The sentiments of various people and groups towards oil (good or bad) were negligible in the book which gave it almost a sterile feel. Perhaps some would argue that this is a pro, but I didn't care for it.<br />  The vocabulary was often distracting. A choice of wording that would be much more straight forward would be overlooked in order to use words that felt more \\"scholarly\\", but instead felt awkward. It also became distracting when awkward vocabulary was used way too repetitively, for example; his indefatigable use of the word indefatigable.<br /><br />-pros: Overall, it was very readable for such an enormous topic. It was orderly and clearly written. It read like a story and not like a textbook, which was quite a trick for such dense material.<br />  I liked how he would let a few years play out in the book then go back and replay those years, but in a different location. It broke it up into bite size digestible chunks.<br />  Most importantly, the content was fantastic. I now have a much stronger understanding of just how oil plays its enormous role in the global society. I can't say enough about how well this book informs its reader in an enjoyable and insightful way.<br />  Lastly, I found it relatively easy to comprehend. It may at points be dry material, but in no way did i feel like this book was written over my head. I suggest to others who might be wondering about this book not to be intimidated.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A very active game and I just love it . I've never had a game get my<br />adrenalian up so fast.
B00003CXA6|5.0|My grandson and I really enjoyed this movie.  We ordered it to arrive after our trip to Gettysburg and it was terrific to watch and see the authentic places that were just viewed in person.  It really brought together the history and our trip,.  I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in history.
B0081336FO|5.0|love benedict cumberbatch and this series.  hope there is going to be more of this series. in the future abd that you will carry it on amazon prime.  love amazon prime too.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Good movie to be entertained.  Also to pass a good time with a good company. It is a B+ or A-
B001BKM3MQ|4.0|I've always loved John Mayer and had lost this album on cd so I downloadd it digitally. One of my favorites!
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|Fight Club could've easily been written off as another male power fantasy about 'sticking it to the man'. Instead it delivers a comedic and intelligent critique of both consumer culture AND its extremist alternatives. When viewed by more conscious minds, Fight Club turns out to be a lot smarter -and darky funnier- than its nay sayers care to give it credit for.<br /><br />Knuckle heads be warned: You might actually think a little as you indulge in Fight Club's...mayhem.
B004I654WQ|5.0|This was my sons favorite movie, he has moved on to others but I consider this to be a classic for him to watch for years to come.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The writing in this book reminded me of what made Stephen King a great writer. It kept me not only interested but glued to the book, Abra is going to have to get a book on her life. She is such an interesting character and can't help but wonder how she will turn out.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Its like a radio online where you can find the music that you love from  your favorites singers  its good
B00F5FEZTC|3.0|It is very retro sounding Elton. A little bit of Blues and classic rock. Not as pop as his past efforts. It's Good, not Great.
0316067598|4.0|Compelling story of  what can go wrong and the consequences of that. A interesting<br />take of a very difficult time.
048623231X|5.0|This guy must have went through a lot while living as his work is very weird, but thought provoking. Love it...
B007FTZDN8|5.0|It's an interesting app where you can find a lot of educational videos<br />I'm studying on the university in Ecuador and I use this app to practice english
B00003CXCQ|1.0|Do not buy this DVD.  It's a fake and the quality in terrible!  My daughter was so excited to watch it but we had to turn it off after 15 minutes.  Thanks for the heart break.
0470876417|5.0|Remarkably simple, clear process that naturally brings together divergent points of view without compromising independence of a broad range of participants. Book is very clear, with excellent processes and examples. Format allows 5-minute reads whenever time is available, and it is very accessible when specific details are needed.
B001XUYA0W|4.0|I actors and actresses were good.<br /><br />The story and directing were good.<br /><br />But I didn't like the way the movie ended.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Its amazing ... you can't imagine all you can do in this game<br />Its full of adrenaline to.drive a car a plane an helicopters and so on
B0084TWN9K|3.0|I found her short stories leaving me feeling what is the &#34;next chapter&#34;. The last four were autobiographical and interesting
1591396190|4.0|Excellent examples. Though a bit pedantic, the book's thought process is logical and compelling. It's great to keep on the shelf and pull out whenever a plan is being built.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was the best book yet it seemed hard to read but its really not. Thats why you should get this book
B008645YXA|5.0|I have loved Alice Cooper since I was a teenager and I am 53.  This has always been my favorite and haven't had it for quite awhile.  I am very happy.  Thank you for getting it to me so quickly.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This product is a Must have!! I would recommend this to all owners of the Go-Pro. Only con is it depletes battery life.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent as always. I can't wait for the next novel to be out. His stories about Afghanistan always ring true.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|I watch this movie on a regular basis. It is the most amazing story, the characters are creepy yet there is a beauty behind each of them. I am mesmerized each time I watch this film.
1612680011|5.0|I really liked the book i've read some others from the serie rich dad poor dad and this one is the mostmaccurate
B000007VLL|5.0|bonnie tyler is one of the best singers been a fan for years would like to buy more of her cds
B007STXHTM|5.0|This product is perfect and delivered on time. I still didn't test it but I'm sure it will met my expectations. Why Go Pro didn't use a flat lens on their casing since the beginning???
B00E1SM5UA|3.0|Yeah OK it's Al. And he is with out a doubt one of the BEST guitarists alive today. From an engineering / sound standpoint this is wonderful. As are most of Di Meola's releases. He definitely puts forth some stellar sounding recordings. If you have a good system this is great. And yes the playing is typical Al. Outstanding.<br /><br />But really. Some of this is easily recognizable. Some of this could pass for elevator Muzak. Think Astor Piazzolla meets the Beatles. Unique? Yup. Needed? No. But might be good background dinner party music at some point.<br /><br />If you're a die hard Beatles or Di Meola fan. Buy it. If not...wait for something new.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This movie exposes what's a growing problem in america. With hundreds of thousands of new wells to come in up in the next few decades this is a problem we can't ignore.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|It's one of my favorite's. I'm glad I bought it. I've been sharing it with my friend's. I love the older days. It's wonderful store .
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I wanted a movie where I'd see the good guys beat the poop out of the bad guys while defying impossible odds. I was not disappointed. Many of the old time faves appear in this shoot em up movie. Stallone and Arnold work well together. Don't expect much of a plot, just suspend reality, sit back, and enjoy the show.
1608838137|5.0|We love these period pieces, it shows us what living in the past was like.  The photography, acting and script are all wonderful.  We can't get enough of Downton Abbey.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Not impressed. The rap and fast paced scenes were meant to impress but failed miserably. I was disappointed in it.
B00000IQV7|5.0|well, it stars Robin Williams. What can I say. An enjoyable movie. It was shipped promptly. Try it you'll like it.
B004TNGLW0|5.0|Awesome! Got it and was in excellent packaging and condition. It's so nice I am not sure if I should use for my cigars or just leave out for show.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Finally decided to read The Hunger Games Trilogy after I found it on Amazon for a great price.  The books were an easy read and for the most part well written.  My only real problem with the books is by the end of the trilogy I really did not like the main character.  Normally you fall in the love with the main character of a book but in this case by the end I really didn't care one way or another what happened to her.  I guess it really wasn't my type of a story.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Danielle Steel always writes beautiful romance stories that make you feel like you are right there!  Or wish you were,  nice, easy read.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This was a very exciting and revealing movie.  It provided some interesting background on the individual characters that were a part of the original movies and tv programs.  I know that some folks will never get past the fact that we don't have the original cast of characters, but I feel that the entertainment value allows the movie to stand on its own.  Indeed, the choice of the cast must have been difficult.  Trying to find actors that could pass for younger versions of Kirk, Spok, McCoy, and Uhura was exceptional in my opinion.  I enjoyed this movie very much.
B00004WX4U|5.0|I would say this is one of my best buys on vinyl. The quality I have not tested yet but I can assure you the content... his voice... is spectacular and haunting
1476734941|5.0|I love this book because it is based on real research, it educates without being overbearing.  You learn and understand what you need to without wasting time on useless rambling.  It also comes with many helpful recipes.  It seems like it is a difficult diet, but after the first 2 weeks it is the first diet I've tried that I could use a lifelong lifestyle change.  It's been months, I actulally stopped the diet because it worked too well and I lost too much weight on it.  My boyfriend still uses it after months and he has lost weight easily and kept it off instead of yo-yoing.  The best part is that it's really not about losing weight, it's really about being healthier.  Weight loss is just a side effect.
145551389X|5.0|Got this for my daughter for her birthday and she loved it, she's a HUGE Gaga fan.  Seriously great coffee table book!
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|This is such a great set of such a great concert, and truly, my favorite all-time band. A must have
B008JFUO72|5.0|I just recieved this movie , it is fantastic as much as the rest of the IRONMAN SERIES---I recieved this movie right on time--I love it
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|i gave this app a 5 star b/c its fun and it was free u can get bonus points for hitting the gopher/groundhog and its super addictive
B00DP94Z2W|5.0|Jason has always been better than the band that made him famous.  This CD is FANTASTIC!!!  Well written and well composed.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is such a good film about prejudice and overcoming it.  About love come and gone.  The sights and sounds of India were great.
6305781427|5.0|I love the music from Yanni. Knowing how this concert was realized by reading his book made me appreciate it even more.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Good game. Could be harder. You are given a dropback pic and you solve puzzles to fill the picture in. I can be addictive once started.
B00AR3WD8W|4.0|I like this cd but I was wanting the complete aloha concert with all the songs. I don't think this has them all. but if you like elvis then you will like this cd
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|my 12 year old loved it.  We are big fans of the Back to the Future franchise and this was done very well!  Worth every penny.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I love the music from Yanni. This DVD shows even more how dedicated Yanni is to his music and his fans.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This dosn't work on my tablet it won't let me log in on my account or let me make a new
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great read from Stephen King.  A page turner till the end.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|Excellent tips on writing from one of the best. Even if you're not a fan of the horror genre, King's book will give valuable tips on finding your voice and how to be a better writer.
B007NZQU72|5.0|This book is definitely for anyone who suffers from anxiety in which almost everything in life seems to make them nervous. It gives the reader great insight and gain knowledge about being highly sensitive.  It will validate all those weird feelings you had as a child growing up and possibly still have trouble dealing with to this very day.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love uno because it is really entertaining. It's nice to count on uno for a challenge.<br />Thank you Uno!
B00447G2PM|4.0|Thanks to all the people who made this deep sea 3D documentary movie such a wonderful experience! Even though is about 45 minutes ,it is still worth every cents<br />I paid for . Kudoz to the producing team !!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love it :) it is boss boss's and awesome and hilarious. One of my favorite ever books yo sucka.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Always a great classic. Just be sure to hide the scissors as my little one cut her hair trying to look like Maria! Lol
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have used this app for months and it worked perfectly. Now all of a sudden it won't let me log in. It won't let me create a new account either.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Nothing much<br />I can said about this movies, just 2 words - Excellant quality !  If you are a 3D movies lover, better get this movie fast !
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I like these Tom Selleck movies. I read where CBS won't order any more after Benefit of the Doubt (May 2012), but I hope Tom makes more of them sometime/someplace.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I am not a Tom Cruise fan most of the time but I was very surprised by the acting and movement of this movie. Several scenes were very unique. I had never seen them before and I watch a lot of movies, I found them to be attention getters. Several twists and turns. I like to try to figure out the bad guy/gal before they are discovered. Much better movie than I expected. You will not be disappointed.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Fast, interesting, a light escape not too much medical info or descriptions. Romance is not overdone
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I don't know why I love these games I just do...They're fun, great time fillers, and I love that I can play them of all my devices.
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|Never saw it before. I heard it was good and it is. Definitely worth watching. I think it's a pretty realistic look at U-boats and their crews from WWII. I've worked on commercial ships for many years, so I have a perspective on seagoing life. It's hard to imagine how they got anyone to sail in those little coffins. They had a lot more b***s than I have.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show with so many witty characters. I am a law student and this show is a great way to get away from doing actual law school work but still be motivated after watching an episode.
0765357151|5.0|This is a great read for any fan of the horror genre. I was a little surprised to find out it's not just &#34;I am Legend&#34;, but a compilation of many short stories, too. Again, if you enjoy reading horror, this won't disappoint.
B0053O89YM|5.0|This shoiw is addictive.  I have finished all seasons and started watching the 5th season on TV.  Just keeps getting better.  Can't stop watching.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I couldn't just watch one episode!  Once you begin watching it, you are hooked!  After I completed season 1, I immediately purchased season 2.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Great special effects, especially the piles and piles of zombie bodies.<br />Pitt, dreamy as ever.<br />We found the UN-as-savior theme a bit funny--there were sort of left-leaning political messages throughout.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These are the most surprising value of a bunch of headphones I purchased recently. The sound is almost Advent style and similar to a pair of very old Pickerings I listened to years ago, although much more comfortable. No headaches from these and smooth<br />sound for a very good price.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Compelling drama with sensible yet surprising twists with a satisfying conclusion. Smart finale with the well written explanations. The acting is first-rate throughout.
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|The Faces work as well as the early solo stuff is just too good not to keep listening to. Too bad Rod was ill for their induction into the Hall of Fame.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Yes, there is melodrama, but I find the positive aspects of this book won out.  The author sets up ethical dilemmas and irony that I haven't seen in a while.  I especially liked the honest inner thoughts of the characters, not necessarily pc at all.  A fast read, intriguing read for the most part.  I would recommend it for a book club for sure.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Awesome addicting fun. Complete with a Jedi mini game<br />I just might buy the next table for it. Keeps me gunning for the next bonus
B000068TPN|5.0|Great movie and a tribute to all who fought in that war.  We need to honor those fought in Viet Nam.
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|I did not like the music at all.  I have the Robert Redford version and it is so much better.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I cant stop playing. I come back just to see how my town is doing. The goals are easy but some take time.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Most of the tracks have been available elsewhere. but it's great to have them all in one place.  It's a varied collection with something for everybody, to coin a phrase. Take 5 of Promised Land should have been the master -- it's definitive!
1742200508|5.0|With a very limited few days to spend in London this book did an excellent job of guiding us through the city.  I have not used this series before but would highly  recommend it as your guide book.  There is so much to see in this city you have to know what you want to see, especially when on a limited schedule.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|I love seeing the Beach Boys.They r all older but they still have the magic.I would buy more Beach Boy dvds.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Love Norah Jones and this CD didn't disappoint me either!  Fun browsing through all the music, I can choose the artists I want and Amazon will suggest more that I might enjoy listening to determined on my browsing history.  Am very pleased.
0099527936|5.0|I would recommend his work to anyone who likes history, especially his scintillating works about the Roman Empire and Pompeii.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The books are helping to bridge the time until the new season.  Luckily my memory can use the help to get ready.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an excellent movie on fathers being good Christian role models!  Enjoyed by pre-teens and teens as well as parents.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Love the new music that was suggested through the Amazon website.  When I teamed it up with the other music I enjoy it fits right in.  Delivery was quick and all showed up in good shape!
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|My 7 and 4 year old girls love theses toys, they come with a few accessories, depending on which one (and which priceclass) u're choosing
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I know this did not get good ratings but I loved the book and thought &#34;how bad could it be if some of that humor was in the movie?&#34;.  My husband and I got a big kick out of this movie.  It was sweet.
B00CM4VC7M|3.0|Cool action figure it is super posable I collect anime stuff so I had to pick this up The only problem I have with this figure is that it's too small. I see this more of a $30 price tag on the figure. But is it cool yeah it is but it's just to fragile just by looking at the figure looks like it might brake. Hopefully legend studios will do a bit of a better job.I mean better has in more durable I am afraid of breaking this figure. But if you have 40 plus dollars laying around I will say go for it. I don't regret buying the figure at all but you have to be a sailor fanatic to appreciate this figure.
B00018D44U|5.0|I know I have access to downloading the MP3 version as well.  That was a cool perk to purchasing this CD.  An amazing classic &#34;album&#34; from Norah.  Highly suggest it!
B000I9WWFO|5.0|I ADORE Kevin Bacon so I have watched this one over and over and over again! IF KB is IN it..I WATCH IT!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|awsome!... i'm not a star trek fan, but actualy i love this movie,<br />it had pretty good 3D Effects....... looks great on my LG 3D TV
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Arrange your microSD Cards with their adapters and throw all your plastic cases away. A real space and time saver. A little thick but ok.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Love Norah Jones and this CD didn't disappoint!  Love that Amazon.com suggests other artists comparable to her.  I bought at least one they suggested.  Good stuff!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Well written and thought provoking.  Not many light bulb moments, nothing really new that has not been present by other authors. Yet good information.
006207377X|5.0|Agatha Christie wrote great puzzlers, and this book fits right into that category. I appreciate the value that Christie puts on life and Hercule Poirot's determination to defend the right to live for every person, even those who seem unimportant or unattractive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a great game. Please add more. One suggestion, include in-app clues as levels increase in difficulty. First and foremost, add more levels.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. My 3 year old enjoys helping me take care of the horses.  I just can't get enough of it.
0307394549|3.0|I never saw this book, although I am confident that Martha Stewart has shared some amazing recipes within it. A daughter requested this book specifically on a gift list, and I bought it for her. I have never heard anything negative about it and I believe it would contain plenty of temptations to try!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I liked this game because of all it's puzzle games and the dark side of the little things chasing you.
0517548232|4.0|It takes a very simple problem like breaking a window and shows how so many people are affected. At first we can see how this could be a good thing. But it is only after looking at the whole picture do we see that ir may not be so good. It makes you stop and think. I don't like economics but it has made me more knowledgeable on the subject.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I can honestly say I expected more for a Morgan freeman movie, although tom cruise impressed me. overall its okay
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|hill climb racing is an awesome physics game! I am addicted to the game and it can keep me entertained for hours! I absoulutly love love the great game!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A good read, but left me wanting more! I recommend this if you like steamy love scenes you can envision.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I love this band! I didn't get to see them perform at Rockfest and was so disappointed. My boyfriend's son said they were actually better last year. So I decided to get their debut album. I can't decide which album I like better. If you are a Halestorm lover get both albums!!!!! I love female lead singers. Lizzy reminds me of Lita Ford. Fierce and feminine all in one.
B00280LYHS|5.0|That was an amazing book can't wait to read the lost hero and the rest amazing book every body should read this book
0761169253|5.0|Such a terrific little book that really help one overcome &#34;artist's block.&#34; I have already read it completely once and am keeping it for a reference.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It has already provided me with a great deal of peace and quiet - my grandson loves it!  Thank you.
0143124544|5.0|A page turner, loved the characters so much I was sad to see it end.... Great book and an excellent author!! Very well written.
0425263908|5.0|Being a huge Fifty Shades fan I was told about Sylvia Day and The Crossfire Novels so purchased the first two. I started Bared to You and finished it in a day since I just couldn't put it down and then finished Reflected In You in the same amount of time. I thoroughly enjoyed this author's writing style and how the end of every chapter left me wanting to just stay up an extra hour and keep turning the pages. My only regret now is that I have to wait for the third book to arrive in the mail but on the plus side, at least I will actually get some housework done. Can't wait to see what happens next with Gideon and Eva!
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|Incredible movie that Dustin Hoffman directed. Who would have known that he was such a terrific director. The movie is for everyone and especially for individuals with a music and performance background.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|This app did not work on my kindle fire. It locks up and you can't set location. I think it is a complete waste of money, and you can't get a refund. beware!!!!!!!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|A great game to play online with friends and family. I love moving ahead on the map. Getting bonuses are awesome.
0425263916|5.0|Even better than the first! Finished it in a day and I really don't know what to say except for I'm looking forward to the arrival of the third book in the series, at my doorstep. Being an author and going through my own writing process right now for my second book in a fantasy fiction/romance series, I needed a break and this novel gave me one. It really speaks volumes to me when a story and its characters can evoke so many emotions and I felt every single one of them. Never did I think I would become a serious fan of Erotic Romance but when paired with a good story like this, I am now. Again, enjoyed the writing style and it was another page turner. Well done Sylvia. Hope the rumors of a TV series are true but end up with better casting than 50 shades.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Goodreads Description- When a white servant girl violates the order of plantation society, she unleashes a tragedy that exposes the worst and best in the people she has come to call her family. Orphaned while onboard ship from Ireland, seven-year-old Lavinia arrives on the steps of a tobacco plantation where she is to live and work with the slaves of the kitchen house. Under the care of Belle, the master's illegitimate daughter, Lavinia becomes deeply bonded to her adopted family, though she is set apart from them by her white skin.<br /><br />Eventually, Lavinia is accepted into the world of the big house, where the master is absent and the mistress battles opium addiction. Lavinia finds herself perilously straddling two very different worlds. When she is forced to make a choice, loyalties are brought into question, dangerous truths are laid bare, and lives are put at risk.<br /><br />This book extraordinary!  It is engrossing and heart wrenching.  I cannot believe that this book is the work of a debut author.  If this is what Kathleen Grissom starts out with then I cannot wait to find out what she can do next.<br /><br />This is the story of Lavinia, who, at the age of 7, has lost her parents at sea when her family was crossing the Atlantic leaving Ireland to find a new life in America.  Lavinia soon becomes an indentured servant and is put in the Kitchen House of a large plantation with other slaves who soon become her new family.  The book is told in alternating viewpoints.  Lavinia who seems like the weaker of the two narrators just can't figure out the difference between her \\"whiteness\\" and her new family's \\"colored\\" skin and why it would mean such a difference in treatment.  She finds comfort with both the Kitchen House slaves and in their children.  She is often put to task to help out in the big house and to help mind the younger slave children.  The other narrator is Belle who become Lavinia's mother figure throughout the book.  Belle is much more grounded in the reality of their situation and often tries to protect Lavinia from the harsh truth of slavery and their masters and mistresses.<br /><br />Grissom has done an exceptional job portraying the awfulness of slavery and how they were treated without going into the terrible detail that she could have gone into with all of the beatings, rapes, and terrible treatment that the slaves underwent.  However her story definitely still portrays the evils of slavery even though she avoided going into detail of the horrific things that were happening to the slaves.  Grissom has also clearly done her homework on the differing social status's of the house slaves and the field slaves, the slaves meager ways of living and trying to maintain a happy home, despite their miserable treatment, detailing descriptions of marriages and holidays.  She also goes into detail about what food were prepared at the time and the games the children played to pass the time.<br /><br />Sometimes I had to put down this book because the events that took place were so emotional that I just had to take a break.  Even so I was eager to get back to reading to see what would happen next.  This was a real tear jerker but a fantastic novel about the darkness and evil that existed for African Americans during the days of slavery.  I highly recommend this book.  5 stars!in the reality of their situation and often tries to protect Lavinia from the harsh truth of slavery and their masters and mistresses.<br /><br />Grissom has done an exceptional job portraying the awfulness of slavery and how they were treated without going into the terrible detail that she could have gone into with all of the beatings, rapes, and terrible treatment that the slaves underwent.

B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book was awesome. Read it and you will be totally amazed. So stop reading this and read the book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Oh My God! (Please note I'm not using text speak to emphasize my point)....Stephen King has still got it!<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is an amazing sequel taking us thru the life of Danny Torrance after the events at The Overlook Hotel. I'll save the recap and just say that this book is clever, funny and horrific.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, however, to fully appreciate it I would think that one must read The Shining first. And if you like Audible.com also, Will Patton does a fantastic job narrating the book.
0545586178|5.0|This is a great book and I received it within the time frame given. I could not put this book down! HIGHLY recommend this book.
B00B0NF4L6|5.0|They wrote a great album. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Wavves. Also the video for Cocaine with Nick Offerman is genius...
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|Umm... Yeah even with no apps installed it is still to big to run on Kindle Fire. I really would love to play it though.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|The short answer is...buy the album.<br /><br />Yes, the song Royals hit #1 on the charts and Lorde is the first solo female to top the alternative song's chart in 17 years.  But let's focus on the rest of the album...  Most critics are giving it strong reviews, and Billboard ranked it 94/100.  Why?  She writes intelligent lyrics, has a good voice, and has music that has a presence. More importantly, she is authentic.<br /><br />Casual listeners will like the song Team, which will be her next top hit. It is a great song with lyrics like. \\"I'm kinda over getting told to throw my hands up in the air... ...I'm kinda older when I reveled without a care...\\" that will play in your head long after the song ends.  The songs Tennis Court, Ribs and White Teeth Teens will also likely be in heavy rotation.<br /><br />I agree that some songs will take a few listens.  The three I have on repeat now are Glory and Gore, 400 Lux and  A World Alone, but give them a few listens and they may become your favorites.  For me, this is my favorite album of the year so far.<br /><br />As an aside, I was fortunate to see her Seattle concert last weekend.  It was an amazing show.  She came out in \\"stage mode,\\" serious and slightly mysterious. However, she was greeted with such an enthusiastic crowd reaction, and these were true fans that were singing along with every song, that then she revealed her surprise, slight embarrassment and delight.  She was genuine. It was a great moment to see. And I look forward to many more albums from her!<br /><br />People who liked this may also like.... My Pandora Lorde station played songs from Lights and Purity Ring that you may want to check out.

159448385X|5.0|This book is seriously the best book I've ever read. I've read it twice already and my daughter has read it twice too.  It had me from the first page and I had a hard time putting it down.  The relationship between the two main characters is touching and heartbreaking at the same time.  Truly a story not to be missed!

B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this novel and found it quite intriguing but was waiting for the end to give answers which it failed to do and left me &#34;up in the air&#34; without any real explanation or conclusion which I found irritating. Like many readers of fiction I do like a beginning, a middle  and an end. The first two of these were very good but I could not highly recommend this book for the reasons given.
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|This is the best fun.  I love this game.  It is challenging.  Can be frustrating at times.  But I like the fact that it has a help feature on it to make sure you're on the right track.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This book was so touching. it was recommended to me by a teacher, and i'm so glad I read it. I cried through it, but it was a great story.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|This book is well-written which is the only good thing I can say about it. Clearly Ms Gilbert felt an urge to pour out all her innermost emotions in writing whether or not readers could empathize or sympathize. A great number of women of her age have been through divorce and broken love affairs, also in some cases, even bereavement,  and have suffered from depression but have had to press on with their lives, their work and families without resorting to such a degree of maudlin self-pity which it would appear to only be curable by travelling to far-off places to seek enlightment of the soul and then pouring it all out at great length and detail to anyone who would take the time and effort to read it.<br /><br />Well, she has got it all off her chest but quite honestly who gives a damn?<br /><br />The lengthy descrptions of her Yoga retreat experience and meditation were boring beyond belief to any reader who may not also be a soul-seeker so that I found myself skipping huge chunks of narrative just to find out if she was eventually cured of her troubles which she later on was due to finding sex and romance with a new man, not that surprising really.<br /><br />This book is merely an exercise in self-indulgence and I can only hope she felt better after writing it all down and selling large quantities of copies to a public readership who, for the most part I feel, will find it a  boring and irritating read.
B0013ND30W|5.0|Expensive, but worth it for something you can't find anywhere else. Both formats look outstanding and we've enjoyed them often. Highly recommend.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|this book was so touching, and I loved it!! It made me smile, laugh, cry. Favorite book for sure!! don't even hesitate on getting it.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book caught my interest right from the start--I'm impressed. This is my first book from Sanderson. Some of the reviewers stated they were disappointed because this was not his best work. If that's true I can't wait to read his other works.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the rest of the series too.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This game is a definite keeper.  I have played this game so many times it's ridiculous.  But I have enjoyed it every time.  The graphics are finnominal.  The story line is great. I really like the pirate skeletons comments.  What I didn't realize for the first few times I played it is there is a bonus chapter.  I wonder how they would get back home and in this chapter you find out.  I would recommend this game to anyone.  Please keep games like this coming.  Thanks
B0064W667Y|3.0|I think it's ok but I was expecting something better... Some cliches and a little slow but mostly it's ok.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a good app, graphics are clear, games vary in difficulty. Exactly what you would expect from a solitaire game, I would recommend it.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|This app worked perfectly for 6 months. I liked it so much that I used it as my bedstsnd alarm clock. Then the alarm failed to sound one morning.  When I woke,  I noticed that the app had crashed. This has happened repeatedly whenever the alarm is supposed to sound. I would reinstall the app and give it a second chance, but I won't gamble my responsibilities on a proven failure.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey will be a force to reckon with in the comedy world. I'm surprised she doesn't have her own show, a la Carol Burnett. Wouldn't that be a hoot? She talks about how hard it was to break into comedy writing because she was a woman, and then to break the mold and make the humor about being a woman. Eh, I'm not saying that well. She does it much better. And she's much funnier.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This is a pretty good book...<br /><br />My only complaint is how arrogant Thor is angers me.<br /><br />I really hope the second book tells me why the Queen dislikes Thor so much...

B009RX8AQW|5.0|Season One will always be better, but I wasn't sure they could carry off a Season Two but they did - although I didn't like how it ended.<br /><br />Delivery was great, arrived before expected, and also it came via Royal Mail this time, not Yodel (I'm in the UK) - I should choose the cheapest shipping option more often, though Amazon didn't add an Import Fees Deposit to my order - but now I understand more about Import Fees, problems like this shouldn't happen again. They did refund me the cost Royal Mail charged for the handling though, so yet again Amazon have been nice to me.<br /><br />I just couldn't wait till it came out here to have it, plus I had missed an episode earlier which I needed to see, but then I realised how irrevelant it really was.<br /><br />The good thing about this show is if you miss an episode, you can still follow the show, but it is one episode stretched over a whole season, so similar to 24 really.<br /><br />If you're into witches, goblins, and crickets, I can highly recommend this. Can't wait for Season 3.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Thank you for giving me a new perspective on how we live our lives. I will share this book with many.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|We love this show and the book that comes along with this set is nice. The case is compact and looks nice.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I am working with understanding and explaining decision making processes on a day to day basis for several years now, offering services in Neuromarketing and giving trainings on how to use technologies to unveal the nonconscious behaviour. This book surprised me explaining many of the phenomena I already knew with a deep scientific foudation, but not too complicated. With everyday examples Kahnemann reveals some of the secrets to understand our own behaviour and the one of the people around us.<br />A great guide to identify bad decisions and how to solve the reasons behind them.<br /><br />It is a fantastic book that I can recommend to people working as business consultants, for profesionals in almost every area where clear decisions are essential, for Students to learn how to review results critically, and for people who simply are interested in understanding human behaviour and decision making and the fasciniating reasons behind our irrationality in our everyday lives.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I loved it and hated it ..... definitely had me grabbing tissues ! Couldn't put down the book from how great it was.
0988262592|5.0|Well worth reading especially if you are up to your neck in it and just need some sound guidance. Primarily focused on Lean and how you can apply this to an IT environment but you can also see where ITIL would play a part and it is mentioned.<br /><br />It's a very easy read and well structured, worth going back over when you've finished and take a few notes.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like this game, can play to relax and set my own pace. Graphics are great. Complete download and didn't lock up my Kindle Fire.
B00EHMG358|5.0|This was just a sample of the book that's to come out in November or December?  I now can't wait for the rest of the story!  It's a page turner for sure.  I love the Pendergast stories and have kept up on all of them, so this will be another great read for me.  If you're looking for a new author, or already a fan, give the sample a try, it's free.  Douglas Preston, and Lincoln Child are my all time, favorite authors.
B0075PXDUM|3.0|Nice to hear their earlier stuff but I like the new material better. Still a must have if you're an A7X fan.

B00B8YSIMY|5.0|This isn't my usual type of book, but what I found was that the genre didn't matter.  The writing drew me in and kept me reading.<br /><br />The main character, Jimmy, is struggling with his cocaine addiction, finding that recovery isn't easy.  His emotions are raw and the story has scenes that are so real, I wasn't certain if it was fiction or not anymore.  This sort of story is already a powerful study of the mind of an addict.  When you add in that Jams N. Roses wrote the tale in first person, you are left breathless from the impact of Jimmy's thoughts and emotions on your mind.<br /><br />The relationship Jimmy shares with the disturbed Jason is surreal, sometimes bordering on unbelievable, but only when you think about it later.  In the heat of the narrative, it seems so real it's almost scary.<br /><br />Overall, I think that this book is one that will shock and touch you as you follow along with Jimmy.  The only critique I could offer is that there are a few scenes that aren't as fast-paced and intense as the rest, but even those seem to add to the realism of Jimmy's character.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|Great film.<br /><br />Only problem I had was when I received the item, it actually had 2 &#34;special features&#34; discs, instead of the actually film disc. I called Amazon's support line, and the promptly sent me out a new one. I had never actually had that happen to me before, and I was actually pretty amused by it, so no deduction.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|I read the reviews. I love comic book adaptions. This is boring!  I watched to the end because I was hoping for a miracle.  Did not happen.
B0060D10I2|5.0|The movie had amazing quality and the movie itself was very good. Johnny Depp is amazing in this film! Great movie!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Not able to make work yet. No problem with unit.  I need betted instructions.<br />Is there more information on line?
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This is definitely for pre-school age kids. It is so silly that I am sure the little folks will giggle. For anyone age seven and above, I think they will find it pure silliness. However it was free and easy to delete.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|This movie is really scary,much better than the comedic original.This is actually horror. Dont watch it in the dark..!! This movie scared the you know what out of me.
0744014956|5.0|Okay, so there's always Google to help with game questions, but I've found this book to contain a WEALTH of information and I would definitely recommend it to anyone seeking 100% completion. Maps showing hidden item locations, vehicle and weapon info, mission guides, random encounters, hobbies.. The list goes on! If you want 100% completion, this book will be a great help.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I think it was good book a little weird at beginning but then towards middle got very interesting when you finally understood everything.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Cleverly done with constant surprises, coming from all directions.  Dialogue kept us on track with trying to guess what direction the story line would take.
0812550706|5.0|This story is beloved by so many, I'm sure one more review isn't going to make a dent. An excellent read with some good life lessons too. Enjoy!
B008ADSDHQ|5.0|One of Nesbo's best.  The writer improves with each new installment.<br />We always lok forward to his next books.<br />Impressive.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|It's been a long time since I've been so wowed by a CD. What stands out the most is the diversity over 11 songs. So many times a band's first album is 11 songs that all sound the same. Not so with Night Visions. Compelling lyrics, incredible rhythms, and haunting melodies blend into one amazing CD! If you don't buy another &#34;alternative&#34; CD this year, pick up Imagine Dragons. You will not be disappointed.
B00BATWJFE|2.0|Not at all entertaining.  The narrator supposedly is afflicted with Asperger's,<br />but the OCD antics are truly unbelievable.<br />Not worth the read

B009WUAK2M|4.0|A very good movie, action packed from beginning to end. I really enjoyed seeing all my favorite old time stars in one movie.
B0082Z447U|5.0|If only to catch a mood and a way of using English to its best advantage, both of which have long gone, while reading quite an exciting book, do try this author who is not so well known as some of his contemporaries.  I am currently reading some of his other works and enjoying myself.  Furthermore, all entirely free on your Kindle or at prices so low they can't strain anyone's budget.
B003Y3ZHUS|5.0|if you are a horror fan like myself and love the early friday the 13th movies especially pt 1-2 you will immediately notice the influence of Bava Bay of Blood(AKA Twitch of the Death nerve) You will see the heavy influence of the kill scenes throughout this movie. Bava to me is the most talented out the holy trinity of Italian horror directors that came on the scene the movie still hold up to today standards of horror and in some cases surpassed it ..A must have if you're a Bava fan..

B000P0J0EW|5.0|I think this will become a classic movie. A great story with great acting. One could not ask for an  entertaining thouhtful movie.
0307719219|5.0|This book changed the way I look at life and my studies. While I'm still unsure if everything in it is correct, it is extremely well presented and provacative enough to keep the reader engaged in a book that will actually teach you something.
0762434279|5.0|This book should be in every home.  It's nice to have degrees, but there are many essential things that are not discussed in a classroom. I read it and have given it as gifts several times.  Knowledge is power.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Aside from the young Kirk, the characters are cast well and the story line meshes with the originals. Great in 2D or 3D
B000068R1X|5.0|NOTE; im not sure if i have the reissue because i got the tracks 1 at a time<br /><br />amazing album probably the best ozzy has written, every track better than the last, if youre new to 80s metal this is a good point to start my personal favorite tracks would be \\"spiders'' and \\"bark at the moon\\"

B009YP9L7U|5.0|He married her without her remembering their wedding. It was suppose to be a marriage without love so no one got hurt but they fell in love anyway. They just had to realize it. Good book for romance
B00B52F278|5.0|I love everything that has to do with Ancient Rome and even though only parts of the Spartacus story is  historically correct, the story is an enjoyable experience.  I recommend it for gladiator buffs and ancient history lovers.
B00CATSONE|3.0|The author has many interesting ideas and a good hypothesis.  But this is not really a biography of Tesla if you are looking for one.  While reading,  I sometimes felt like a young pupil at a lecture. There are many quotes in this book but no citations. Why does the book not include references for the quotes?
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|I love the Great Gatsby story BUT this over stylized sham of a production defecates all over the original work<br />1st the positives. It looks good, the party scenes and the set design are every bit as audacious as you'd expect from a work that lampooned the gross excessiveness of the roaring 20s.<br />2nd The acting is pretty good and they had the right cast<br /><br />Now the bad<br />1) I cant stand an historical piece that uses modern music. WHY IS JAY-Z on the soundtrack and why do I hear his annoying hip hop rhymes throughout the movie? It just takes you out the story completely. The 1920s had a soundtrack and hip hop and rap was not part of it. And for that matter neither was techno music which is also featured throughout the movie and during the party scenes. You wouldn't make a civil war movie and have Britney Spears singing Opps I Did it Again during one of the battle scenes, then why have Jay-Z playing when they walk into a speakeasy<br />2) They miss a lot of the character story and the symbolic meaning of the book as embodied in the characters. What they did to Daisey is a shame, she isn't just a person she represents something each person is metaphor and when you change how certain characters acted and reacted to the storyline then you lose the metaphor they were supposed to represent<br /><br />In short, this movie was a butchering of a classic. A very stylized butchering but it butchers the work that F Scott Fitzgerald created, but it does use a pearl handled hatchet
B006JD48NM|5.0|This is hard to watch and not cry - and I'm a MANly man - I think a person has to be a racer to fully understand it
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|As of 10/13, the Chromecast is still a bit limited to what it allows you to do, but I expect that to improve with time. As of now, you can cast any Chrome tab from a laptop or desktop computer to your TV, along with YouTube and Netflix. You can do the same from a mobile device, but be aware that you cannot cast a tab from a mobile device. Only YouTube, Netflix and Google Play. Again, I imagine that will change. Setup is easy and for $35 to basically get the Internet on your TV, it's well worth it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|My husband and I love this movie for it's comedic value. George Clooney is an ace in this film and we laughed from beginning to end.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Easy read. Suspenseful but not over the top. I suspended my beliefs and allowed myself to be carried away into this reality. Enjoyable.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this app the only thing is the price of bits (lock in app purchaseis first) it 's easy to accidentally buy something

B002VPE1WK|5.0|For the price this backpack is a steal.  It holds my Nikon d5200, 18-55mm zoom, 55-300mm zoom, 35mm prime, 105mm macro, SB-700 flash, and everything else I need to go with it easily and snugly.  Can't go wrong here.
0061714402|5.0|Even if you're not a fan of Metallica or Megadeth or Dave, this is a great read.  The storytelling is excellent and the book reads like a novel where you can't wait to see what happens next. And if you're a fan, the book is just that much better.  Highly recommended, one of the best memoirs I've read yet!
0399159347|3.0|It was okay --<br /><br />did not keep my interest like some books do!!<br /><br />I would not recommend it for others to read.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a really good story and written very well. I really liked it but I didn't love it! There was a lot of hype with this one and I don't feel that it lived up to it.<br /><br />Hazel Grace Lancaster is dying of cancer and goes to her weekly Cancer Kid Support Group where she meets Augustus (Gus) Waters and they develop a kindred friendship right away.<br /><br />Hazel Grace had already written her life story, but everything changes when Gus comes into her life. She is now more active and taking advantage to what life she has left as a teen. This is her story and how her views differ from the norm.<br /><br />This book deals with life and death and the life of cancer. It was well written and I think John Green is a fantastic author. Even though I didn't love this story, I would be willing to read another one of his books.
1405911662|5.0|I have not started reading this.  I have loved everything I have read by Ms Moriarty.  i am sure it will be enjoyed by all.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I was a professional sound engineer for 17 years and i know my headphones..For the price, these are the best headphones I ever heard. They compare with my Bose headphones. For the cheap price you cant beat them, The frequency response is fantastic..The cord is a little heavier guage than most other headphones and can take a beating without breaking..but if the cord does break going up inside the headphones, you can pop the small cover off where the cord goes in and take out one small screw and repair them yourself...The only thing negative about the headphones is that they do get a little warm on your ears after awhile because the size of the earpads do cover your entire ear..I give them 5 stars..For the price, you cannot beat them..
0385349947|3.0|I read this book - twice- when it first was released.  I consider it a must read in many regards, primarily because most of the criticism of this book is not well placed and only by reading the book can you understand the author's message and valuable advice to both women and men.<br /><br />However, I don't believe the author's discussion around child care is particularly accurate.  She cites the 2006 NICHD Study of Early Child Care as support for her argument that women can \\"lean in\\" to their careers without worrying about the effect of child care/day care on their children.  It is true that this study states that \\"Children who were cared for exclusively by their mothers did not develop differently than those<br />who were also cared for by others.\\"....But it also states \\"the data suggest that most child care settings in the United States provide care that is [merely] \\"fair\\" (between \\"poor\\" and \\"good\\"). Fewer than 10 percent of arrangements were rated as providing very high quality child care.\\"  The study discusses the benefits of high quality day care and the risks involved in lower quality day care.  Considering that most women cannot afford high quality day care, her exhortation that women aren't harming their children by putting them in day care is not the complete picture.  It's unfortunate that this was omitted from the book.  She of course does argue that we need to increase access to high quality day care - but since we are FAR from reaching that point, it is worth considering the consequences of day care much more than she does in this book.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Awesome series it's well worth watching. It's got a lot of character to it. The story line is well thought out too
B007J4T2G8|5.0|though this story was way too good to be true it had me from the get go. I managed to read the entire trilogy in one week.

B000059TEP|5.0|Love this movie - have watched it several times. Miss Patrick Swayzee - he did a great job with Demi Moore in this film.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I wasn't familiar with the story, and I'd never seen movie about this.  I normally read science fiction so I downloaded several classics to give me some balance in my reading.  Despite being a jaded, cynical, bitter old man, I found this story to be sweet and endearing.  It's a good story that's well-written and enjoyable, and it's interesting to read something written a hundred years ago.
B006FE83UE|5.0|this is not only a great, great movie.  brilliant script, direction and especially performances, but it comes with all the great extras.  cannot beat the price.  this is one of a handful of movies everyone should own

0345803485|1.0|Ok so I was drawn into the hype of this series. I was all gung ho to read it. My friend loaned me her copy (thank god I did not waste my hard earned money on it!!) And I had to force myself to get even halfway through it.<br /><br />Her first time having sex and giving oral was so unbelievable I was left scratching my head and saying really????? I dont remember my first time being that easy! There were just too many unbelievable things in this book, yes I know its all made up. Not real. But PLEASE at least make it believable, that it could really happen. She isnt Cinderella and this isnt a fairy tale. We are adults here, so please don't insult our intelligence.<br /><br /> I rarely put books down and not finish them, but this one was so bad I just couldn't loose more time out of my life reading it. I have read erotica before, and have enjoyed it. But this??? I did not enjoy. I hate to put authors down, I know how hard must be to pour your heart and soul into a book, and how much courage it takes to put that first book out there, but this author has so much more potential. All she had to do was start with short stories on erotica sites to get criticizims from readers to improve on her technique before she dove into a trilogy.
1451668945|5.0|Great story.  Normal Mary Higgins Clark style which I expected.  though I am not sure where the title came from.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I gave Lark Rise a five star because of the characters. You see everything about Candleford and Lark Rise through their eyes. The setting is during Queen Victoria's reign so you have the well-to-do folks and the poor. All work together to help each other through life's difficult situations. Some episodes are better than others. But still it is a wonderful series. I would recommend this to anyone who loves stories such as Wives and Daughters, Little Dorrit, Bleak House, Sense and Sensibility, or Emma.
B0000CDL93|3.0|I purchased this for my daughter for a school project.  I love stories about the Kennedy's and, at the time so did my daughter, this one was so long she barely made it.

B003M6OW4Y|5.0|The fast paced action, intelligent, likable characters, and clever writing from season one continue in season two as the plot proceeds towards the end.  Unlike many other series, this series has an end in mind in which secrets are revealed and mysteries are resolved.  The characters continue to develop until the very end.  I have to say that I found the choice for the character who betrayed the good guys to be contrived, but by the time I found out who it was, it was too close to the end to offend my suspension of disbelief.  I was truly sorry when the show came to the end, but I liked how the plots were all neatly tied up, with all the good characters having acquired growth and depth tinged with sadness.
B00DEFW8YY|5.0|It must be an emotional experience for a gifted, dynamic pianist to approach the heights of the piano repertoire recording Brahms with a talented young maestro and two of the best European orchestras. Helene Grimaud clearly views these concertos as life-changing works, and here we have a serious major release that asks to be the most attractive one of both concertos since Pollini and Abbado, also on DG.<br /><br />Approaching the 1st Concerto, we soon realize that Grimaud boasts great magnetism. She takes this beast of a concerto with an authoritative technique that leaves no doubts about her control. Every bar has the undisputed mastery that defines the greatest pianists. But what is most striking is her imagination, which defies the common conception that this is a ponderous, rambling concerto. She grabs the ear with phrasing that weaves the most beautiful lines without ever becoming self-conscious or losing her grasp. It's hard to fathom a more perfect marriage, \\"invincible yet vulnerable\\", as she put it. Everything is majestic, yet personal to the point of being nearly painful. And the variety she displays is breathtaking, from moments of near stillness in the gorgeous slow movement to the towering force of the finale, which sounds titanic yet gloriously adventurous--has anyone bettered it? At the podium, Andris Nelsons lets Grimaud carry the show, with accompaniment that is never aggressive. He prefers gentle refinement to open drama, which sounds like a bad idea, but it is the perfect compliment to Grimaud. He shares her sensitivity, to be sure, so the Bavarian Radio Symphony never sounds stiff. He conducts with great finesse, choosing sweet lyricism that truly sounds free.<br /><br />Coming to the 2nd Concerto, we get a very similar approach, only the music is more inspiring and we now have the Vienna Phil. Actually, Grimaud logically views this concerto as more intimate than its predecessor, so this reading is rich, colorful, and always reflective--very autumnal, really. A quick listen makes this reading sound low key and it almost is. There's not much barnstorming. But Grimaud uses reflection as a vehicle to exploit the most captivating emotions. She's as mesmerizing when she phrases with tenderness as when she displays her full powers. She seems to be searching for meaning, using the concerto's nobility to communicate on a level of the deepest sincerity. It's grand and soaring with freedom, yet there's an element of fragility caused by the complete emotional vulnerability. It's hard to describe how gripping she is for those who haven't heard it. Nelsons adds to this feel with conducting that is surprisingly resigned. He sounds natural and fluid, yet he rarely produces sheer excitement. Sometimes it may catch the listener off guard, especially in the 2nd movement where he breathes a quick prayer where one expects blazing triumph (the start of the new theme in D around 4:45). Some will think he goes too far in his refined ecstasy, but what might not work by itself sounds perfect with the volatile Grimaud at the keyboard. I don't hesitate to place this reading with the best from Gilels, Barenboim, and Pollini.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is Grimaud's show, and her pianism is unforgettable, transforming these indisputable masterpieces. Other pianists may be more dazzling, but few have been as poetic, much less while still maintaining such astonishing control. Bravo.mnal, really.

B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|The 20/20 Experience Part 2 is here. And like so many greats before him, Mr. Timberlake has fallen victim to the curse in which an artist reaches the point in his/her career where the music (s)he has previously released is so good that anything following is deemed a \\"let down\\" regardless of how good it is. This was bound to happen to JT at some point, and based on what critics are saying, it looks like now is the time. Luckily, I never take critics' opinions to heart; in the case of this album, they'll have you thinking this gem is trash.<br /><br />I'll admit that if forced to chose, the 1st part of the 20/20 is the better album because of how it's put together. There's something magical about how \\"Pusher Love Girl\\" opens and sets the tone for the whole album, how it leads into \\"Suit & Tie\\" which flows into \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\", and so forth. That aspect is missed with 20/20 pt 2. These songs seem as if they didn't \\"fit the flow\\" of pt 1, so they were set aside and given a separate release because despite not \\"fitting in\\", they were too good to not let us listen. Plus, the overall vibes of the albums are different. Part 1 is full of love and happiness; Part 2 is darker and has mixed emotions.<br /><br />Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want) - Not the magical opening that is \\"Pusher Love Girl\\", but a good song. It puts me to mind of the opening of Futuresex/Lovesounds--dark, mysterious, and hypnotic. There's a Queen/David-Bowie-esque quality to JT's vocals on this track. The beat sounds very much like classic JT--like a sound perfected between \\"Justified\\" and \\"Futuresex/Lovesound.\\" 9/10<br /><br />True Blood - Screams `club-banger.' There is still something David Bowie-like in JT's vocals. As the song goes on, JT talks, Timbaland gives evil laughter, there are ghostly noises and howling; you can't help but to think this is JT's version of \\"Thriller 2013.\\" 9/10<br /><br />Carabet - Sounds like the good old days of 1990s Timbaland R&B with Ginuwine and Aaliyah. Quirky butcool. Drake fits perfectly on the track. Could make for an extremely popular single for Urban radio...This one could be a hit if released. 10/10<br /><br />TKO - This one hits hard, pun intended. Another club-banger. Love the \\"bounce\\" to it. The chorus is catchy and drills into your brain. Impossible to not bob your head along to this one. Catchy and fun. 10/10<br /><br />Take Back the Night - Ironically, this is the one song on this album most critics seem to agree is \\"good.\\" Strangely enough, it hasn't quite grown on me despite it being popular with so many JT fans. People swear it sounds like \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough.\\" I don't really hear the similarity. I hear the obvious MJ-influence, but that can be found in so many JT songs; it's hardly unusual. It's a decent song, but for me, in comparison to others on this album, it sounds like a filler. Then again, it took \\"Suit & Tie\\" some time to grow on me (I now love that song), so maybe I just have to let it marinate...8/10<br /><br />Murder - The misstep. This song is one of the reasons for my 4.5 instead of 5 star rating. It has become a trademark for JT to make long songs, and I usually have no problem with the length of his songs because they are so darn good. But this is the only one that I found myself waiting for to hurry and end, despite it being the shortest song on the official album. I'm 99.5% sure I've heard a Timbaland song somewhere with the exact same beat. Jay Z's verse is unnecessary and uncomfortable to listen to. In the battle of guest-appearances, Drake crushes Jay-Z. JT's verses are enjoyable enough, but the chorus is boring, the song drags, and Jay Z hurts the track (and not in a good way). I find myself skipping the song after JT finishes the second verse somewhere after the 2-minute mark. 6/10<br /><br />Drink You Away - I didn't get a chance to listen to the album when it was streaming for free on iTunes. However, I do recall reading a review that stated that this was somewhat a countrysong. I love JT, the \\"blue-eyed soul\\", so the thought of him doing a country song worried me, especially since I hate country music. However, this song masterfully blends country with JT's trademark soul, a bit of rock, and somehow manages to do all of this with a gospel feel to it. And there's a desperation in JT's voice in this song that I don't think we've heard before. Great song. 10/10<br /><br />You Got it On - This is called \\"stepper's music\\" in Chicago (something R.Kelly made popular worldwide). I have no idea how this boy from Memphis knows about that, lol. This is JT, the blue-eyed-soul, at his finest. An incredibly beautiful song and just may be one of the prettiest song of JT's career. His voice is heavenly (think falsettos of Smokey Robinson mixed with Michael Jackson, and a touch of Al Green, and that's what you've got here). He sings \\"it sounds like falling in love\\" and that is precisely what the song sounds like. I haven't heard something so pretty from JT since the Justified album's \\"Take It From Here\\". 10/10<br /><br />Amnesia - All of the negative reviews critics have given this album are made invalid single-handedly by THIS song. It is AMAZING.  Flawless production, flawless vocals. Emotional and sublime. This song is epic to the level of \\"What Goes Around Comes Around\\", complete with a beautiful ending reframe. The ending reframe of this song rivals \\"I Think She Knows\\" that closes \\"Lovestoned.\\" This song is in a league of its own. A true stroke of genius. Again, all bad reviews are made irrelevant because of this song alone. 11/10<br /><br />Only When I Walk Away - Rock-star JT, but the soul is still there. This track is darker and somehow reminds me of songs like Aaliyah's \\"I Refuse\\" and \\"The Other Woman.\\" Very rock-infused, but melodic. This song though, perhaps is overly ambitious with its many changeups. We're used to JT's songs having 2 parts--well, this one has 3. The final ending switch-up goes into a reggae-vibe, where you hear Timbaland in the background bragging that \\"You are listening to the illest duo in the Unites States of America\\" and with the innovative music he and JT have been making, it's hard to argue. The song's switch-ups can be little unsettling because they come out of nowhere and lack the smoother transitions we're used to in JT's songs. However, each segment is great, with the reggae bit being my favorite. 9.5/10<br /><br />Not A Bad Thing - Very pretty song. I do, however, wish I had the edited version of it. This song drops f-bombs that seem so strange and out of place on a song that overall, is so loving and tender (JT sings, \\"You might f--around and find that your dreams come true with me.\\"). I guess he didn't want to look to \\"soft\\" or something. Apart from that, this is a very pretty and very sweet song. A fitting closing to the album...9/10<br /><br />Except, it's not a closing (it should have been though--another minor misstep).There's a hidden track that starts up after it ends. This song, \\"Pair of Wings\\" is a definite throwback to *Nsync. The song is very sweet--perhaps overly sweet for some people's taste. His voice sounds very beautiful here though. However, the song seems to never end. 7/10<br /><br />Now--if you get this album from Target, you will be treated to two bonus tracks (on a separate disk). The bonus tracks are:<br /><br />Blindness--a cool song with a mellow jazz/reggae vibe. 8/10<br /><br />Electric Lady - One of my favorites of 20/20 Pt 2, despite it not being on the official album. This song is far too good to just be a \\"bonus\\" track and it would have been nice if this was the hidden track on the official album instead. The song is really cool. I adore the rhythm JT sings with and the melodic quality of this voice. 10/10<br /><br />All in all, JT did it again, and he definitely had a tough act to follow with the first half of 20/20. Just like I said after listening to 20/20 Part 1---<br />Just give Timberlake and Timbaland the Grammys already!aland the Grammys already!
B00827OXJ2|5.0|Rated one of the best movies of 1996, this movie does deliver. Sporting a cast of talented actors and actresses such as Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, John Ryan and Joe Pantoliano make Bound such a success. The movie sort of goes like this: A mobster, his mistress and a tough ex-con are caught in a dangerous plot with over $2 million of the mob's money at stake. Tilly and Gershon come up with the plot to steal the money from Pantoliano, but not before engaging in a little lesbian lust, which quickly turns to love are they ready to set their plan into action. But Pantoliano turns the tides on both and that's where the real fun begins. Bound is full of action, adventure and plenty of plot twists. It's a scary, funny, sexy and exciting movie that will keep you glued until the end. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. So Happy I waited until it was out on BLU-ray
B00C04H2VO|1.0|I paid over $50.00 for this item, and when it arrived, it looked like something you could buy in the Dollar Store for $1.00. When I returned it and paid for the postage again, I only received a refund of $31.00. I think you should know what kind of company you are allowing on your site, Is there anyway I can get the rest of my money back?
B0085KGHI6|4.0|Good DVD.  Picture quality is good but not amazing.  It is however a piece of history and the music is great. I would recommend it to anyone who likes either of these bands.
B00908DDZM|5.0|The songs not on the radio or even better than the ones you always hear on the radio. Definitely a CD worth buying.
B009JZ5FO8|4.0|Exactly as described. This was what my daughter was wanting for her birthday. Good quality consistent with the Barbie brand.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|This CD is solid from beginning to end. There were several songs that I had heard of but didn't realize who the artist was.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|SUCKS I've played this and it sucks don't play it it will not be fair for children because of the glitches and bad influence
B003UPPO2G|4.0|Family fun.... four generations of my family danced.  Maybe Disco didn't suck after all.  We gave it a shot... very worthy!
0142410705|5.0|A very excellent book for fans of the author. Every bit as engaging and as full of character as Looking for Alaska. Great read.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is Lots of fun, and hard to put down.  The pictures are very detailed. I would recommend to any level player.
0307887448|5.0|Best Scifi book in the last 10 years.  I have given multiple copies to friends.  Can’t wait for Ernest Cline to write another book.
B00EEXPDTM|4.0|Good but somewhat depressing.  Not titillating.  Sort of like &#34;Behind the Music&#34; only for a porn star instead of a rock group.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I use one of these all the time.  It works great!  The carbide sharpener can repair some seriously dull blades with little effort.
0817439390|5.0|This book is awesome - especially for NEW photographers!  I just started taking pictures about a year ago - and this book has helped me so much!  I've read it 3 times, and I learn soooo much every time.  I would recommend this for ANYONE that wants to have more control of there DSLR camera.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My product came quickly and is exactly what I wanted! It's long and is a great color. I am very happy.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was a good set of books. It was interesting, fast paced, and hard to put down. i was a little disappointed in the ending however.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Must read!  I highly recommend it if you enjoy her other books.  Especially if you found Elizabeth Woodville to be annoying.
B000FC2KL0|3.0|I am about 3 /4 through the book.  It is somewhat entertaining if you have followed the band, but it is written somewhat poorly, almost lower level.  Of course, not sure what I expected from an ex-addict rockstar!  Other rockstar autobiographies, (Steven Tyler, Sammy Hagar, Eric Clapton, Gregg Allman) that I have read were better written.  I'm still engeged in the book however and will finish it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game so far, seems limitless to me. It seems like every time I beat something a whole mess of other things becomes unlocked. It's got high replay ability. If you like tower defense games, this would be a good one to add to your arsenal.
030758836X|3.0|I liked it this boo... just didn't love it.  I was definitely not fond of the ending.  Hope the Ben Affleck movie is better!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's just like loading the webpage for the most part, only you can't sort your feed which I hate! I like sorting my feed in order of how recent things were said. This only puts it by &#34;most popular.&#34; That kind of sucks. Otherwise, it's the same old thing.
B00B4MB5Q6|2.0|I didn't research it proberly.  When I saw &#34;Tour&#34; I foolishy assumed it was a live recording.  3 more words required
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I'm too old to be this into social media, but whatever. I only recently got into Twitter, and mostly just to watch Nathan Fillion say funny stuff. So far so good.
0307743659|1.0|Didn't like this book dragged too much and I'm a fan focused on too many things at the same time
B00B4804KS|4.0|It's jurassic park.. I mean come on! So, the 3D wasn't super evident throughout, but it was a pleasant addition. I could live without it of course, I mean you practically have to anyhow. There really isn't too much 3D action anyhow, considering it wasn't filmed that way.. so they could only do so much. If you don't own Jurassic Park on DVD yet, spring for this one! Fun for the whole family.
0451196716|5.0|I think this is one of the scariest book I've read it kept me thinking for weeks. I really got into the walk
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|I grew up watching this series, and when the remake came out I realized i'd totally forgotten about it. So my husband and I watched the new one, and he had never seen the original. I had to convince him to sit with me and watch it in all it's cheesy glory.. or gory. Whatever you prefer. It's still just as good 20+ years later.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is very addicting. I play Daily. Music is soothing and graphics are great.  There are many levels so no one should ever be bored.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Quentin Tarantino is sort of worn out in my mind. I get his schtick, and applaud his accomplishments. I didn't want to see this movie initially; it just didn't look that good to me. I bought it for my husband whom I thought would enjoy it, and so we sat down together: me fully expecting to hate it. I didn't. It was a really good movie! I mean it really seems typical of what you would expect but it was a really good story. If you havn't already, and aren't offended by overly bloody fight scenes.. give it a go!
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|Never give up; never surrender. Such a fun movie. Mixes the serious with the comic. Its classic status is well-deserved.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I purchased this for my 7yr. old grandson.....he is over the moon....may have to put a time limit for him to be on my Kindle as he played this until the batteries were depleated
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We have become hooked on the series.  Very well done and I would recommend this to anyone who watches or wants to get caught up
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|Would Recommend This To Antone Who Likes Joe This Is The Music For You.Great sound and artists on this cd, .
B008Y212PI|4.0|GREAT GAME. I PLAY FOR HOURS AT A TIME. LARGER GRIDS GET A LITTLE DIFFICULT BUT IF YOU USE THE HINTS IT HELPS.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|I love The Great Gatsby (book and Robert Redford version) I found myself comparing the two movies which I shouldn't have. This was a good take on the book from a different director's pov. It was more colorful and musical.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I never really enjoyed the original Doctor Who--being rather young it was a bit much for me, but I love love love the new series. So imaginative and funny! Love the relationship between Rose and the Doctor.
B0053O89RY|4.0|I love Modern Family. I can always find myself in at least one of the characters per episode. This show is a more modern take on families.
B001IKKMCW|5.0|I love this child hood video. (Atleast from my time) every one should see it ones or many times has I had.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great movie for almost anyone- except children under 13 (because there's swearing). Super funny, just waiting for the second one!
B0044KJIIC|5.0|so in love with tom welling. hated to see show end. but i can watch it anywhere i want now!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Great movie, one of the funniest, heart-warming, and extremely clever and witty. classic and with classic character voices too! yes
