B007J4T2G8|2.0|Okay, so, despite the bad reviews, I decided to give 50 Shades a try.  The talk I'd overheard about it was inconsistent, either a love or hate thing.  I gave in when I heard a lady at work calling 50 Shades \\"Mommy Porn\\" and she basically said that anyone that reads the book is a dirty slut.<br /><br />Take all the 1 Star reviews, and I'll agree with them.  For me, the most annoying part of the book was the repetition.  I was SO freaking sick of Ana blushing, flushing and biting her lip.  Oh, and referring to her parts as \\"down there\\".  And Christian, what's the deal with his long index finger?  I should have made a drinking game out of the repetition, but I would be passed out drunk within 2 pages.  Seriously.<br /><br />The sex scenes?  I didn't find them hot.  I've never read \\"erotic\\" literature, so I have nothing to compare this to.  But I found nothing interesting about the orgasm after orgasm after orgasm.  (Which REALLY seems unlikely for a virgin, but that's besides the point.)<br /><br />I gave this book 2 stars because at least I have my own opinion on it now, and I was able to tough it out and finish the book.  I have heard the story got better in the next 2 books according to a couple friends, but I don't know that I will give them a chance.  The story would have to improve like 1000% for me to not feel like its a total waste of my time.
B000QXDFQW|3.0|This review is for those who are simply interested in knowing whether the blu-ray transfer is a good one.  It is quite good.  While this is not a movie with a great deal of scenic vistas or special effects, the colors are strong, and the details are crisp.  The sound was fine as well (again, for this type of movie).  I had not planned to upgrade this title from DVD to blu-ray, but I found a good deal that made it worth it.  My rating of 3 stars is for the movie overall; if I were only to rate the transfer, it would be a solid 4 stars.

0439023521|5.0|The nation of Panem was born out of the ruins of what was once known as North America, and at its center is a powerful, beautiful, and technologically-advanced city known as the Capitol. Twelve Districts surround the Capitol. It was once thirteen. Once, long ago, the Districts tried to overthrow the oppressive Capitol. They were all defeated, District 13 was annihilated, and as a reminder to never rebel again the Hunger Games were born. Every year, each of the twelve Districts must send one boy and one girl, aged 12-18, as tributes to fight in the Hunger Games. It's a brutal fight to the death, and there can only be one survivor. When Katniss Everdeen's twelve-year-old sister is selected as District 12's seventy-fourth female tribute, Katniss volunteers to be tribute in her place. Thus begins an unrelenting story of one girl's desperate quest to survive in a contest she stands little chance to win. Making matters worse is that the boy tribute from District 12 is Peeta Mellark, a boy who once saved her life.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins is a non-stop journey into the desperately flawed heart of humanity. Twenty-four teenagers are thrust into an impossible situation that requires them to do things they were never meant to do merely to survive. The result is violent and unsettling, but we grow to love Katniss Everdeen and hope for her survival because she seems meant for so much more than the Hunger Games. She seems meant to cut to the heart of the Capitol, and this story seems to begin that journey.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I really enjoy post-apocalyptic stories, and this is one of the best I've read. The story concept is twisted, and no sane person could hope for another person's death because they ended up in the Hunger Games, but the story creates a world that is obviously corrupt and desperately in need of redemption. I loved that about this story. I haven't read the other two books in the trilogy yet, but I'm hoping for a taste of redemption by the end.<br /><br />I loved the first-person narrative of the story because it makes the reader feel like they're experiencing the Hunger Games through the eyes of Katniss. I also felt like I really got to know her character because we get to hear her thoughts throughout, and she quickly became a very likable character.<br /><br />Foundational to the concept of THE HUNGER GAMES is the idea of sacrifice, that for one person to live someone must die, or in this case, twenty-three people must die. Katniss makes what will possibly be the ultimate sacrifice when she volunteers to be a tribute in her sister's place, and we see this concept of self-sacrifice throughout. For the most part, the tributes aren't heartless. They don't want to kill, but they must kill to survive. But alliances are built along the way that makes the idea of killing someone you possibly care about very difficult. Collins amps up the stakes up to the very end of the story with this theme. Will Katniss kill to survive? More importantly, will she kill someone she's grown to care about to survive? Collins pulls you into the story with the emotional cost the Capitol wants the tributes to pay.<br /><br />The world of THE HUNGER GAMES is incredibly well-built. I could picture the run-down appearance of District 12 and the gleaming technological perfection that is the Capitol. This is another way the first-person narrative really helped to drive the story. Panem is the epitome of human depravity as we learn that those in charge in the Capitol have an insane thirst for power, and this plays out in their enjoyment of watching the teenaged tributes slaughter one another in their yearly games. Their greatest source of entertainment is also their primary method of exacting punishment and ensuring the obedience of the Districts.<br /><br />The characters were brilliantly developed. Katniss Everdeen, a girl who has survived heartache and subsequent abandonment because of the death of her father, cares deeply for people. Collins shows this through Katniss' actions and inner dialogue over and over again throughout the story. Yet she's also forced to do things that no one would ever hope they had to do. I found myself desperately wishing she didn't have to kill anyone, but understanding that she's been placed in the most impossible of situations. Haymitch, Katniss' mentor, is intriguing because of how winning the Hunger Games has affected him. Peeta Mellark, the boy tribute from District 12, is an interesting character because of the choices he makes throughout the story and the revealed motivations behind those actions. The other tributes range from sweet and innocent to vengeful and bloodthirsty. The collective entity known as the Capitol is the most mysterious character of all. They leave me with the most questions. How did they get so powerful? Why did the Districts feel they needed to rebel, and why was the Hunger Games the response the Capitol came up with to punish the Districts for their betrayal?<br /><br />The end of THE HUNGER GAMES left me wanting to read the second book immediately. I'm interested to see the aftermath of what happens in this story and Katniss' place in it all.<br /><br />Given the popularity of THE HUNGER GAMES movie, it's clear that Suzanne Collins has written a story that resonates with people. It explores the messy choices people must make in the midst of a dangerous world and the nature of sacrifice. It's a dark story, but it's a story that confronts us head-on with the value of human life and challenges the terrible ways we're tempted to treat one another. I can't wait to see the movie now that I've read the book, and I can't wait to dive into CATCHING FIRE.<br /><br />I received this book for free for review from Scholastic, and I was not required to give a positive revieweeply for people.

B005M7P9XE|1.0|The one star is for the packaging ONLY!<br /><br />The packaging is awful. There's nothing \\"deluxe\\" about it. More like super cheap.. It's basically a digipak without plastic trays! The CD's are placed inside cardboard sleeves. At first I could not get them out; they wouldn't slide out. The mini booklet contains some photos. NO lyric sheet!<br /><br />Bottom line: fantastic music, cheap packaging, which does not befit the term \\"deluxe edition\\". Terribly disappointed!
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|This review covers the blu-ray transfer only, not the movie itself.  The transfer is gorgeous!  It makes the film look like a recent release.  The sound really pops, too.  This is a must-own for Star Trek fans.  It is totally worth the cost of upgrading from the DVD.

0439023513|5.0|When it comes to the third book in a trilogy, all bets are off. Everyone is dispensable. Anything can happen. And the tension is raised higher than it ever has before. MOCKINGJAY, the final book in THE HUNGER GAMES Trilogy by Suzanne Collins, kept me up at night. Because I had to finish it and because I felt like I had to deal with the difficult themes it wrestled with. MOCKINGJAY is a book that will make you think long after it's over and feel the emotions it provokes even longer than that. It's what you would expect after you've been invested in these characters for three books.<br /><br />I had to wrestle with this one for a couple days because as a piece of dystopian literature, the ending is bittersweet. I didn't want the story to end, but all great stories must come to an end. For Katniss, the journey to the final page of MOCKINGJAY is mired in heartache and widespread loss of life. The twists and turns of this story kept me reading until the end. In fact, I read MOCKINGJAY in two days.<br /><br />In the end, I think Suzanne Collins wrote an incredible finale to an emotionally stirring series. I've read that many people were disappointed with it, but as the story unfolded, I understood that within the context of the story Collins was trying to tell, the events leading up to the end made since.<br /><br />There's a chilling scene near the end that I won't give away, but it was a brilliant move on Collins' part to raise the unsettling question of whether the rebels who are trying to overcome the Capitol might just end up another incarnation of the Capitol. Though the goal is to stop The Hunger Games, will the rebels actually stop it or see it as something necessary to maintain control? MOCKINGJAY, as well as the other two books, is a startling exploration of the inner darkness that seems to dwell in human hearts.<br /><br />MOCKINGJAY explores some weighty themes such as love, vengeance, war, and ultimately hope for a better world. Collins has created a thrilling and thought-provoking story that stands along some of the greatest stories of our time. People will be talking about this one for a long time.g and thought-provoking story that stands along some of the greatest stories of our time. People will be talking about this one for a long time.

B008XG1X18|5.0|New to Pinterest got the app-little slow to load-but love all the access I have to my new obsession!!!!! No problems on my fire works well.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|I kind of enjoyed watching her do it vicariously. I definitely could relate to the sense of excitement and possibility fueling Becky Bloomwood's smallest interactions, and, more unfortunately, to the lengths she'll go when she realizes her fantasies won't come true. Breezy, conversational style and vivid, well-developed characters keep this one standing as a women's fiction standard-bearer...I enjoyed the movie, though it had the misfortune of being released in the depth of the recession, but the book fleshes out more of Becky's motivations and makes her seem more competent, if still idiosyncratic and likely to use \\"girly\\" means to solve things that leave more seasoned people scratching their heads.
0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins painted a world that revealed the darkest aspects of the hearts of humanity in THE HUNGER GAMES. In CATCHING FIRE, Collins continues Katniss' story with the aftermath of Katniss' decisions in the previous book, taking us deeper into a government system built on power, oppression and senseless killing, as well as deeper into the mind of a girl pushed beyond her limits with the fate of a nation and those she loves most resting on her shoulders.<br /><br />I loved the first book. Not because of the senseless bloodbath that it depicts, but because it reflected a world desperately in need of redemption, and Katniss struggles, in a sense, to be a light in the darkness. I loved the second book even more. As the story progresses, it begins to feel like Peeta is the real hero of this story as he pours all of his energy into protecting Katniss even though she doesn't know how she feels about him. It's an incredible picture of unconditional love.<br /><br />Collins does an incredible job of raising the stakes for the players involved. With the end of THE HUNGER GAMES, I wondered in what direction this story could go next and if it would be as captivating. CATCHING FIRE feels like you've been strapped in for a relentless gut-wrenching thrill ride where you're desperately hoping the horror of it all can somehow be undone.<br /><br />The villain becomes more present within the story in CATCHING FIRE as we're given a closer look at the mysterious President Snow. The man is powerful, knows it, and will mercilessly destroy anyone who threatens that power. Collins gives a chilling description of a man who wears an aroma that is a mixture of roses and blood on his breath.<br /><br />Nearly every chapter ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger, making it really hard to stop reading once you get to the end of a chapter. Once again, I loved the first-person narrative from Katniss' perspective. Collins gives us some great descriptions of the world of Panem throughout so that imagining what it's like is really easy. The end of the book will definitely leave wanting to get the next book and start reading immediately.<br /><br />I love post-apocalyptic stories and I love trilogies.

030758836X|1.0|I agree with the reviewers who thought the first half to two-thirds of this book was FANTASTIC. It was suspenseful, gripping, well written. But the end...oh the end!! It's like the author decided she was too plum-tired to finish the book properly, much to the crushing disappointment of MANY readers! It was just plain gross! And the grossness was utterly without meaning. If you're going to make your readers feel like they need to scour themselves in Lysol there should at least be a purpose behind it and there simply wasn't. It was bad, so bad! I'm certainly not saying things should have wrapped up nicely/happily ever after with a bow on it (and that's not what I was expecting). But for pete's sake, there was no real resolution...I got to the end and thought, \\"THAT's the end?!!?! Are you KIDDING me?????\\" It felt totally unfinished. And now I wish I had never read it. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the author's intent but blech! What a waste of a potentially fantastic book.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|A DVD that went right into the garbage can. Seems to be bits and pieces taken from other movies, (Amer.) put together. It is confusing the primitive aborigines with normal Americans. Total nonsense.
0374275637|5.0|Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahnemann is a wonderful, thoughtful reflection about our thinking methods, and the priceless gift of right intuition. A complex, analytic dissection of academic theories, the book is an adventure of its own.

1935670913|1.0|I'm sick of authors who get ahead by basically cheating. Shame on those who do this. I will never buy this book just because of this. The author may fool a lot of people, but this needs to be stopped, and one way to do that is to refuse to buy his book.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read all 3 books (3 Times).  I understood what & why Christian has gone through in his life to get where he's at.  I loved Anestastia for the fact that she felt something from the beginning she walked throught that door at his office.  She stuck by him and helped him as he did help her through there ordeals.<br /><br />I know there's a lot of sex involved, however she was his therapy and she helped him deviate from the only other life he was forced to know.<br /><br />I can relate to him.  There's some powerful line in this book that had me shaking and crying.  I don't think this is a book a teenager can read alone with a Parent guiding them and explaining some of the contents as I did with my 16 yr old daughter.<br /><br />I beleive if you go into the book with an open mind and read through every ordeal that Christian has endured through child hood to become what he is and how Anastasia has actually, not cured him, but opened up is eyes to a different world that is out there other that the one he was led to beleive.<br /><br />I loved the book.  I heard they were making into a movie. I can tell you that since I started reading this book there was one artist in my mind throughout the entire series that would fit this part perfectly and he is ANDREW MCCARTHY.
B0056K4VRM|4.0|The highlights here are the \\"Linz\\", \\"Prague\\", and \\"Jupiter\\" symphonies which are miraculous performances (although there is an almost inaudible low pitch hum in two of them). The overtures and \\"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\\" are also outstanding. All of these are definitely five stars! Bruno Walter was over 80 when he conducted these in the late 50's but the Columbia Symphony Orchestra responds with elegant yet powerful performances which have rarely been equaled. Listen to the opening movement of the \\"Prague\\" on CD2 for a miracle of recording. The only conductor who could come close to this is Charles MacKerras with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.<br />The Requiem on CD4 is in mono and cannot stand up to modern recordings such as Abbado and Colin Davis. I'm afraid it would rate maybe one star to my ears.<br />At the price of this set, it's a mostly outstanding bargain and I wouldn't hesitate to add it to your collection, especially if you haven't heard Bruno Walter's wonderful way with Mozart.

0143119680|2.0|I thought I would like this better after getting through the first 1/3 and finally getting pulled into it. And it did start moving faster and had more interesting plot twists that kept the reader involved, especially after they went to France. My major problem was there is no wrapping up of any of the story lines. After 600 pages you are still wondering about the relationship of the main characters, the book, the DNA, and the big overall of evil witches and vamps against the all for love witches and vamps(and daemons).<br /><br />Even if there was a conclusion and not a cliffhanger, I would still have only thought this book was Good because it just dragged way to much, in way too many places, with too much description that lead no where and repeats. When it does finally take off, obvious things are missed by the main character and there is some predictability, like her sleeping all the time when normally she barely can stop speeding and she doesn't question it, Marthe insisting on her learning the tea and not bothering to look up what the herbs do, or discussing it with Matthew, going outside when Matthew is sleeping (for the first time ever) I loved her aunts and the group that is formed at the end but I started not liking either Matthew or Diana much and liking the secondary characters much better. Then the end started dragging like the beginning, with the teaching of the time travel spell and waiting for Halloween.  In the end, I felt I wasted my time because I cannot get the conclusion (book 3 isn't even up for pre-order), the 2nd book will be dragging too, it is the way the author writes. And I'll not remember the story line in 1/2 a year.

B007YIVUZU|5.0|I hadn't read a Nicholas Sparks book in a while so I purchased this one on my Kindle this summer. I really, really enjoyed it! The story is told through several different points of view. I don't always love flipping back and forth between characters, but Sparks really made this work. The book begins when US Marine, Logan Thibault, arrives in Hampton, NC. He isn't 100% sure why he's come except that he's found the picture of a woman while overseas and is strangely drawn to her. He stays in Hampton after finding her, still unsure of his place there. The story is romantic and suspenseful, and I really thought that Logan's character was believable. There are plenty of twists and turns in the story that kept me reading. It's a quick read! Enjoy it!
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|All the one star reviews of this album are ridiculous. Some people are actually giving it one stars because it depresses them? Excuse me, since when did tragedy preclude a piece of art from being appreciated?<br /><br />This album is not what you would expect from Pink Floyd but it is a poetic masterpiece. I don't think there is a stronger anti-war song ever made than The Gunner's Dream, or When the Tigers Broke free. I cannot understand why supposed fans would view songs like \\"One of the few\\" or \\"The Hero's return\\" as being bad tracks. The album does have some slow parts but works as a whole as a very strong concept album.<br /><br />Roger is pouring his heart out on this album and you can really feel it. The music reinforces the words brilliantly. It's hard to make it through \\"The Gunner's Dream\\" without tearing up with that saxophone solo.<br /><br />This album makes Piper at the Gates of Dawn look like a complete turd, and all following albums are very uneven under the new leadership of Dave.<br /><br />I also don't care for the criticism that this is supposedly a roger waters solo album in disguise. By this point Rick Wright's personal problems reasonably had him kicked out of the band, Nick Mason apparently had consistent problems keeping up his \\"chops\\" despite being a drummer in one of the greatest bands ever, Syd Barret was a crazy hermit long since removed, and Dave pretty much had no ideas for songs. What did you expect Roger to do? This album may be mostly Roger but it is solid, distinctly Floyd, and has a heart to it.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I have used this model of headphones for over 20 years as part of my job in video post production.  These headphones are the work horse for broadcast television, editing, quality control, sound engineering; all forms of production and post production. You don't need to buy any other brands of headphones that cost more money and don't perform as well. I currently have at least 4 sets of these (some stay at work, some I use at home) and my oldest set is over 20 years old and still work fine...  even if the ear pads have lost the vinyl and are down to just the inner cloth.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, you can break these if you drop them or abuse them. But I use then everyday in the course of my job, and have had very few problems with them. They come with a standard TRS phono jack (tip, ring & sleeve) which also unscrews to reveal a mini jack that will work on iPods and laptops.  One weakness is that the standard phono jacks on these have a tendency to break at the tip which handles the left audio channel. If you break the jack you may not notice it because it will still be attached, but you will lose audio to the left side. Just don't think that the cord is bad or the left speaker went out. Just check the jack tip, it can be easily replaced. A Sony replacement will cost about twenty bucks, so I always save my old headsets for parts.<br /><br />I only gave these four stars because the quality has diminished some over the years. Early models were all made in Japan and of top quality. In the last few years these are now made for Sony in China and the cords are far less hardy than they used to be. The cords now have a tendency to lose the 'coil' and loosen up after several months of constant use. Usually you will only have problems with the jack over extended use, but like I said, it is easily replaced.<br /><br />Try them out, they are the industry standard for studio monitors.

B004ZN9ERI|1.0|I'm no Pink Floyd fanatic, I've known of their existence, enjoyed singles and heard Dark Side hundreds of times. After seeing Roger Waters perform the Wall I really picked up on the later albums and have a huge appreciation for the band. Naturally I had to give this legendary Syd Barret character his due and listen to Piper at the Gates of Dawn.<br /><br />What greeted me was a piece of utter garbage. This is one of the most suprisingly uninteresting, boring, tedious and pointless albums I have ever listened to. I am a fan of rock & roll of the 60's and I am not exactly a young guy anymore, but I just got nothing out of this. In fact, I can clearly admit that I hate Barret and whoever thinks he was a genius should jump off a bridge. The lyrics are soulless, pointless, and stupid, and the music equally just crap.<br /><br />I listen to the Legendary Pink Dots, that band and their lead singer Edward Ka-Spel are often compared to this era of Floyd and Barrett. I can confidently say Ka-Spel blows him out of the water in every aspect.<br /><br />I am no stranger to weird or psychedelic music, I am a fan of industrial, minimalism, etc. but this is the most difficult album to wrap my head around in any sense. I was literally referring to my player's time keeping to find out when I could finally finish this turd of an album and remove it from my life.<br /><br />It is amazing this album receives high praise yet albums like The Final Cut receive criticism. It is also amazing Pink Floyd was even entitled to make a second record after this.

I couldn't get it to move forward or backward.  At one point it jumped to about 3/4 of the way through.  I was so disappointed!<br />I used the return print-out & sent it back.  I was pleased with how amazon.com dealt with the whole transaction of immediately returning my payment, with no shipping cost.
B000002549|1.0|To see why, all you have to do is listen to Patricia Petitbon, or Lesley Garrett, or any one of a number of real singers perform the incredibly sublime Lascia Ch'io Pianga. Then listen to Streisand's travesty on this disc. This is one of the saddest arias in all of opera. When done properly, it will bring tears to your eyes. But Streisand rushes though it, with the most ridiculous accompaniment. She doesn't have a clue about the meaning of the piece. Besides her voice is so harsh, it's just painful to listen to her. She's clearly out of her league.<br /><br />You can find Petibon's and Garrett's renditions on YouTube by googling \\"petibon lascia ch'io pianga\\" and \\"garrett lascia ch'io pianga youtube\\" respectively. Unfortunately Amazon does not allow URL's to be included in reviews.<br /><br />Petibon and Garrett are my favorites, but there are so many other wonderful versions found on YouTube. Also worth checking out is the less Baroque-sounding, but still magnificent,  rendition of Maria Callas.  You can find it by googling \\"callas lascia ch'io pianga mp3chief\\".
B000UR9T8C|5.0|With the first two Spiderman films both a critical & financial success, Spiderman 3 had big shoes to fill. Does it live up? To me, it not only lives up but it surpasses my expectations. Unfortunately, many others were so appalled by this movie that they really went out of their way to say it ruined the whole Spiderman franchise. Appalled by what exactly? A goofy dance scene, a dark looking hair style that makes Spiderman look emo (when he really wasn't), a small scene that involves crying or the much awaited Venom only has three minutes of screen time? Sadly, those were the reasons. I knew so many people that were so butt hurt that Venom didn't have big screen time, that they would actually lecture me on why this movie \\"sucked\\". It's sad really, because that's not what I was looking for in this film. I expected an epic action movie that still kept all the traditional traits of the heart & soul of Spiderman. That's what I got. This movie was action packed, emotional, fast paced and FUN above all else. It takes a very big risk by having more than one villain (three in fact) in this film. I thought it was a great choice to do this because it gives the film a quicker pace and Spiderman more to do instead of discovering how to use his powers again. I feel like this film had a million ideas and used them all. The casting it still fantastic and still remains spot on.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire is still fantastic as Spiderman. He looks like he is having more fun this time around. He plays Peter Parker much more comfortably now just as much as the character is more comfortable with being Spiderman now. He still has moments that make his life difficult such as his girlfriend MJ having problems with him, Harry losing his memory, a competitive photographer joins The Daily Bugle and realizing that uncle killer is still out there. Like the first two films, it shows us how human he is and it's still a difficult life being a superhero. He gets even more interesting when wears the black suit which makes him more violent and more full of himself. Tobey has much more screen time than before and he really carries the film. Not once is he boring to watch, because he's always working. It was great to see the title superhero take center stage rather than having an iconic villain steal the film from the rest of the actors *cough Dark Knight*.<br /><br />James Franco as Harry Osborn is now a fully developed character along with Peter Parker. In the 1st film, he was a neglected son who was trying to impress his father. In the 2nd, he was cocky/ vengeful millionaire who was still living in the shadow of his father. This time, he is a full blown villain who wants vengeance on Spiderman now knowing it's his best friend Peter. Like Maguire, Franco really makes this film shine. He is unpredictable character who has a charm to him. For awhile, he loses his memory after a fantastic fight scene in the beginning of the movie. Even then his is quite charming and funny to watch because he almost acts like an innocent kid again. But things fade fast and he's back to wanting Spiderman dead. Like Spiderman, Harry is a character that is also human. He faces a tough time choosing between revenge and forgiveness. It was great to see another character go through a change from the first film.<br /><br />Kristen Dunst is still great as Mary Jane. She has much more screen time than the first and she's matured as well. MJ is also facing a tough point from getting fired from the theater to having a boyfriend (Parker) who's bit full of himself like a celebrity. She may come off as a whiny b.... to some viewers, she is still human. We've come to the point in life where we grow jealous of someone we care about. It adds to her character instead of making her a ditsy teenager like in the first movie or even the comics.<br /><br />Thomas Haden Church was awesome as Sandman. Following the footsteps of both William Defoe's Green Goblin & Alfred Molina's Doc Ock, he does a fine job filling those shoes. He is a sympathetic character who only commits crimes to save his daughter. But things are much harder on him when Parker learns he apparently killed Uncle Ben and is now out for vengeance. I was happy to hear that Sandman was finally going to have a spot in a movie; he is such an overlooked villain. How can anybody not like a guy made of sand? There was so much that could be done with him from making hammer arms to becoming a giant sand monster. I've never seen such an unlimited character since the T-1000 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The CGI on Sandman looked amazing and it's one of the only few times I'll say it's CG used right. He has some really good fight scenes with Spiderman like the scene in the subway which really showed us what Sandman could do. He is sadly overlooked and many fanboys think some like Rhino should be in this movie. Yeah, people want a villain whose only specialty is running through walls instead of an unlimited villain who can do anything.<br /><br />Topher Grace is a fine Eddie Brock. Many fanboys were so angry that he wasn't a steroid looking character like in the comics. Honestly, I liked it better that he was skinny because it makes him like a shadow of Peter Parker. This is exactly what he is from the comics. His character is everything opposite of Parker. He's selfish, desperate, and a sore loser which is what the character of Eddie Brock is meant to be. Grace really pulls off being a character that is full of BS and was willing to do anything to get big. It all backfires both badly & gloriously. By the end of the movie, he obtains the black suit and becomes Venom. Many fanboys had their feelings hurt to see Venom only in the movie for the last half hour. I thought it was handled fine because it made an epic climax for this movie. The character is still true to the comics as in his hatred for Spiderman and being an opposite of him. He is an evil messed up character who I actually enjoyed watching regardless of how long his screen time was.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are still fantasic as always. J.K. Simmons always shines as J. Jonah Jameson along with his crew of The Daily Bugle (Ted Raimi, Elizabeth Banks, etc.). Rosemary Harris still plays Aunt May straight and perfect. She was to the first Spiderman films as to what Michael Gough (RIP) was to the first Batman films. Bryce Dallas Howard was fine (and good looking)as Gwen Stacy, although I do kind of agree she was just there. Elya Baskin as Mr. Ditkovich is still a funny random character who's slightly more sympathetic this time around but still press Peter on paying his rent. Of course this wouldn't be complete without Bruce Campbell as the French waiter who tries to help Parker purpose to MJ. I love Bruce Campbell and this film wouldn't be complete without him.<br /><br />The actions scenes are a show stealer in this movie. All of them are fun to watch and each of them have a story to back them up. The first fight between Peter & Harry was fantastic and emotional. How often do you see Spiderman fight without his costume? It's rare, not even the Nolan Batman films really do that. But the major theme of the film is revenge! Every character wants revenge in some shape or form. Spiderman wants revenge on Sandman for killing his uncle, Harry aka New Goblin want revenge on Parker for killing his father and Eddie Brock wants revenge for being screwed over. But either way, it comes back on Spiderman who is at the center of it all. Even though this film is action packed, it has it's share of funny moments like the Jameson scenes, the dinner scene with Bruce Campbell and the night club scene. The film doesn't go overboard with either it's silliness or it's darkness. It does a fine job keeping a balance.<br /><br />But there are it's share of negative moments. I feel like so bits were rushed like the intro of the black suit. I think Gwen Stacy was a pointless character who was their to add to the love triangle of Peter,Harry & Mj. I also think the some of the dance scenes could have been cut. But that's a minor issue because I enjoyed that scene.<br /><br />Overall, give this film a big chance and don't listen to fanboys who are butthurt the film wasn't all about Venom. It highly enjoyed this movie and it made a fine yet unexpected climax to the original trilogy. It saddens me to think that this film is considered to be the \\"Batman & Robin\\" of the Spiderman films. It was barley given a chance before fanboys cried for a reboot. It more saddens me that fanboys will now talk so much trash about the original trilogy's legacy because they got the reboot they cried & whined for. Forget about the original's having state of the art special effects for the time. Forget about the original's basically beginning the superhero genre going strong today. Forget about the fine acting for dialogue of the first three films. To the fanboys, it's all about \\"Venom only in the movie for 3 mins. I won't remember this films for that. I'll remember them for it's clever writing, awesome action scenes, fine acting, ground breaking camera work and more. This film is no different. It was an action packed movie that never got boring or slowed down. It was what movies should be, FUN. I hope someday, people will look back at this movie with fond memories and give this movie a better review. Much like how Batman Returns was back in 92. It was panned at first but is now looked back as a classic film.w long his screen time was.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are still fantasic as always. J.K. Simmons always shines as J.

B005LAII5I|5.0|Here I am with my review of expendables 2 this isn't going to be an in depth review just 1st viewing thoughts. I feel it's a good sequel I don't know if it's good as 1st movie thought I have seen that movie a few times & I love it. Now I saw the teaser late last year & it didn't interest me the guy they got to direct Simon West hasn't had a good track record the past 10 years. I heard they made it PG 13 from the start. I had my concern's about it. Stallone not directing & such. I saw the newer trailers & it got me excited I was going to see it anyway being a big fan of the 1st. I saw it & I enjoyed it. I do feel Stallone ghost directed it & Simon West did what he was told. All of the characters return Slyvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jenson, Terry Crews as Hale Ceaser, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench, Bruce Willis as Mr Chruch, Chuck Norris as Booker, Jean Cluade Van Damme as Jean Villain, Scott Atkins as Hector, Nan Yu as ,Maggie, Liam Hemsworth as as Billy The Kid & Jet Li as Yin Yang, I'm not doing a huge retrospective with the plot I'll do a big in depth review when I get this movie on DVD or Blu Ray. Just a quick run down is Mr Church has Barney Ross & his team go to Albania to retrive a device from a safe from a plane that crashed you're introduced to this girl named Maggie that can crack the code cause the safe changes comnbinations every 127 seconds. Now originally it was suppose to be Mickey Rourke that was killed but he didn't return as Tool Box so if you've seen this movie you know which Merc is killed. The Merc's are confronted by Jean Villain who kills 1 of The Merc's not telling he takes the device they got from the safe that has blue prints to an abandoned mine that has tons of Plutonium from The Cold War. This movie is plentiful in action. I'm glad they didn't go with the shakey cam. There is CGI & if you don't kow I hate CGI & prefer practical effects. I do thinkthey should've went with practical from the start. But as long as I have fun have characters that I like I really don't get on CGI as much. I can tell that they went for an PG 13 from the start & decided to add gore to get a R rating. But I enjoyed myself this past Friday as I said I'll go more in depth when I get it on Blu Ray. I liked the referances to Terminator, Rambo & the tiny little nod to Cobra. There were some really good fights in here with Stallone & Van Damme. Jason Stahman & Scott Atkins. Simon West did a good job listening to Stallone. Slyvester Stallone did a great job again. Jason Statham did fine. Dolph Lundgren did good. Terry Crews was ok. Randy Couture did ok. Scott Atkins I feel was there to get a younger demographic & I could of done without him. Nan Yu was did a very good job. Bruce Willis was good. Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good. Chuck Norris didn't get whole lot of screen time but he did a good job. No pun intended Jet Li had a really small role but he did fine. Jean Claude Van Damme was pretty good he did he wasn't playing it like he was a zombie like he did in Universal Soldier Regeneration or how he will in Day Of Reckoning or how he did in Assassination Games. Scott Atkins was pretty good. As I said with the 1st Expendables don't go in expecting an Oscar Contender & enjoy.
B007SGM084|5.0|Interesting reading for my wife and I. Couldn't get her to put it down and added a little spice in our life. Everyone needs to try something a little different in a long term relationship so it doesn't get stale. Enjoy!

B00884GR0W|2.0|This is not minecraft! It is worse! I like that there are quests, but there needs to be some updates. Doors, ladders, and what happened to everything made out of blocks! Day and night come and go too fast. and the demo movie says, 'but not to stay in one place.' so I don't, because I can't! The first time I was building a house I got attacked by a monster.(And another thing I don't like is that the monsters run away when they are about to die) So it ran away and being very revengeful, I chased it. But when I<br />came back to were I was building my house, it was gone! Another time, I was collecting pumpkins and I saw one aways away, so I got it, turned and saw my house was still there. Good, I thought, but when I went in to check and looked into the far back corner, just the back corner was gone! And I never get my stuff back! One last thing, I was doing a quest to kill &quot;borlog&quot;(however you spell it) and I built a stone bridge to him. But then he hit me so I started freaking out and accidentally put out blocks. Then the next thing I knew, I was rising through the ground back to the surface and looking down on the monster that took me so so long to find!! People say that this is better then minecraft, it is not!
0307887448|4.0|While I completely agree with some of the other reviewers that the EXTREME emphasis on obscure 80's pop culture is a bit much, the book was a lot of fun to read. It's essentially cyber-punk full of references you actually recognize.<br /><br />Fantastic first effort from a new novelist.  Really looking forward to additional books by Mr. Cline
B0021L8UPS|3.0|Of course, one can see by the ratings given here at Amazon most people seem to have enjoyed Orphan. I found it to be ok at best. In order to enjoy the movie one has to suspend one's disbelief in order to believe as the father in the movie says \\"...that a 9 year could do that...\\" and then when you get to the surprise twist near the end of the movie you have to suspend your disbelief again I could say more about it but I don't want to give anything away.<br />The plot is not anything original. If you've seen The Good son, The Bad Seed, The Omen you have an idea of how the movie is going to go for at least the first half of the movie just by looking at the movie poster.<br />I saw the movie with other people and they seemed to enjoy it more than I did. For me it was mostly a \\"been there, done that or seen it before\\" type of thing mixed with an inability to suspend my disbelief.<br />I didn't give it a bad review mostly beacuse of the girls' acting and because if other people enjoyed it while I watched it with them then it can't be all bad, can it?
0439023513|1.0|* * * SPOILER ALERT* * * *<br /><br />The first two books were so good. This last one made me feel cheated and angry. I slept mad all night. Then woke up annoyed today. Here's the thing, if she didn't have it worked out all the way through, I would've preferred she left me hanging for another year or two until it was planned right. So many problems with this book, it simply needs a total rewrite. Among the most prevalant problems:<br /><br />1. Katniss on dope - Was this book written by someone else who didn't read books 1 & 2? Katniss is not a drug-dependent junkie who can't handle her emotions and surroundings. She's a stone-cold survivor. Why was she in a hospital bed and on morphine so much?<br /><br />2. Shooting promos - why was more than 1/3 of the book spent on Katniss shooting promos pretending to be a hero. Why? She *is* a hero. While the districts battled the Capital, she laid in bed doped up or shooting commercials.<br /><br />3. Romance - where did it go? Peeta and Gale were barely a consideration. As Katniss was busy looking like a hero in front of the camera, I kept wondering, when is she going to break into the Capital to rescue Peetah?<br /><br />4. Ending - Susan Collins phoned this one in. Choosing Peeta sort of by default because he was a friendly neighbor who kept up her garden was such a let down. She may have just as well chosen Haymitch if he visited more. I wanted a grand gesture, something HUGE that would've demonstrated clearly, without question, that Peeta was the only one for Katniss. Instead, we had a depressed and lonely Katniss who picks Peeta just because he was around. Wow.<br /><br />Here's how it should've been written - Katniss breaks out of the arena with the other victors. She discovers District 13. She arrives and disagrees with Coin and everything about the way 13 is run. It's ruled exactly the same way Snow rules things. Why would Katniss fit in? She doesn't.<br /><br />She forms her own elite group, separates from 13, mainly to rescue Peeta. Along the way back to the Capital, she helps the other districts in their battle against the Peacekeepers. Coin tries to take credit for Katniss's participation in the rebellion, but it's clear to the people that Katniss doesn't answer anyone. She is fighting against tyranny whether it be run by Snow or Coin.<br /><br />She rescues Peeta, whose brain isn't freakin' hijacked. He has been tortured, but he is intact. They all go after Snow. He is not found easily. Somehow Katniss gets in a jam and is captured. Gale suggests they pull back to regroup - no need to kill everyone for the price of one person. Gale is wise, but Peeta is led by his heart. Peeta tells him to go, and saves Katniss alone. When she's being tortured by Snow, she realizes how much she loves Peeta and how much she regrets he didn't know.<br /><br />Peeta saves her in the nick of time. Together, she and Peeta kill Snow. And it's a big, public death worthy of their greatest enemy. They announce to all that the districts are no longer under one rule. They return to District 12 as heros where they elect Gale as their District President.<br /><br />Epilogue - Peeta and Katniss have kids. Gale are Madge married with kids. The Districts all have Presidents. There is open trade and between the districts. Freedom wins.
B003UESJHY|5.0|While I don't know how much of the movie closely follows the facts of the true story it's based on, it certainly feels genuine. Everything about the setting feels real and one can easily associate with the characters. The acting is great - Bale and Leo in particular were amazing. Whether or not you like boxing, this movie is very enjoyable for anyone who appreciates great drama.<br /><br />Micky Ward is a boxer trying to earn a living and succeed in the sport. His devotion to his family becomes problematic because his brother is also his trainer, and his mother is also his agent. Dicky Eklund, his brother, is an ex-boxer with a big drug problem. Micky's mother and sisters want him to succeed, but they don't always know what's best for him and have a very skewed perspective on things. After Micky gets involved with Charlene, a bartender, there are confrontations over his management and Micky is forced to make some difficult decisions. It was easy to sympathize with what Micky went through.<br /><br />While some of the characters are likable (Micky and Charlene) and others tend to be reprehensible (Micky's sisters), they all evoke a strong emotional response. The acting and writing is very believable all around. Without knowing what the outcome would be, the last fight was entertaining and engrossing (and I'm not a boxing fan normally).
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been reading sci-fi for over 25 years, since my early teen days, the genre has been the majority of my fiction reads. Following an engineering education and infatuation with technology and advance, this interest only grew deeper. Enjoyed the works of giants such as Asimov (literally cried when he died) , Clark, Heinlein, Lem, Simmons (till he borderline lost it) just to name a few. When you read amazing authors such as those two things happen 1) You eventually run out of fantastic works 2) You are left looking for new masters. A long time spent anthologies and reviews, provided sporadic solutions to these problems. Then, in comes kindle and a flurry of $0.99 sci-fi novels. I read my share of those and guiltily enjoyed (though not thrilled by) the often high paced, military sci-fi space soap operas.<br /><br />When I downloaded \\"Wool-Omnibus\\" I thought this'd be one such series. More action than character development, more lasers than thought provocation. DEAD WRONG. Wool is not only a great sci-fi story, but it is masterfully written. Characters are developed with painful attention to detail among intricate settings. The premise is not novel but the application and presentation of it is.<br />The mastery of the author on the English language is evident in EVERY page. His words quickly turn into images in your mind.<br /><br />Howey turns major Orwellian ideas into a splendid sci-fi novel. Going back to character development... no single major character is simple. Even the perceived evil character has a code diligently followed and from certain points of view maybe righteously so. Here is another major divide between this \\"diamond\\" and a myriad of \\"rough\\" out there. Characters are not just black on white. The book allows you to appreciate every character as opposed to building them as clear bad guys and good guys. Achieving this balance requires talent.<br /><br />When a great story meets great characters, a great book forms. It did here. And looks like it willkeep happening. I am hoping Hugh a looooong productive life and continued great work.<br />As a collector of every single Hugo and Nebula award winning novel, I can be so bold as to say that, it won't be much until one of his books will join that collection in my old school library.<br /><br />Thank you Hugh!

B0030DIP7O|2.0|The albums themselves are great, classic Scorpions. But each disc is just in a paper sleeve. Each sleeve has the cover and the tracklist/info on the back. Problem is that everything is so small and hard to read, especially Virgin Killer. It's a reproduction of the vinyl sleeve, just twice as small. There's no lyrics printed, obviously.<br />As someone else pointed out, they're not remastered. Therefore, this rather cheap looking package is a bit overpriced. On the other hand, it's nice to get all 3 albums at once. But unless this release is cheaper than the current amazon price, I'd suggest getting each album individually if you can find them for good prices.

0439023491|1.0|I wish there was more depth to the writing and to the thought processes behind the creation of this dystopian world. I found myself skimming through paragraphs because what Collins decides to focus on is tiring. Fashion, food, makeup, a love triangle. The movie will need to make some serious revisions if it has any hopes of not spiraling into silliness.<br /><br />There's also the problem of the love triangle. In the first book, this love triangle was apparent, but it wasn't the focus of the novel. Gale was back in District 12 while Katniss decided her best survival strategy was to feign a romance with Peeta. Well, more like she was coaxed into this strategy, and more like she's not sure what her feelings for Peeta really are. I mean, really, can't our heroine have any conviction at all? Anyway, now that she's returned from the games, her mind is lost in confusion over whether she should love Peeta or love Gale, and each of these guys is angry/jealous over the other, though I think Peeta's more cool and understanding about it than Gale. But honestly, I could care less. Neither of these two are well-developed at all, especially Gale. His presence is barely felt in the first book. Katniss may know Gale better, but the reader knows Peeta better, and that's more important. Still, when you're living in a dystopian world with an oppressive government, there are more important matters than deciding who to fall in love with, right?<br /><br />And I don't understand Katniss' hesitation about becoming a revolutionary herself. She just wants things to be as they were before, without considering the problem that things as they were before means 23 teenagers will die horrible deaths each year. She's terrified by the news of rebellions starting up and wants to stop them. Even worse, she schemes to run away with those she loves. If there is a more cowardly move I can't think of it. How's this girl a hero again?<br /><br />I really wish Collins spent less time on the scenes devoted to dressing Katniss up and feeding her extravagant meals. Removing those would have had a wondrous effect. I'm not saying the book would have been great, but certainly better. Katniss herself even begins turning into those people of the Capital she's supposed to despise. She actually likes getting dressed up and talking about how she looks, though she wouldn't go so far as to dye her skin purple. I found myself skimming over these scenes because they contribute nothing to the story, and they destroy the satiric context of having the privileged elite play dress up while poor children kill one another on TV.to dressing Katniss up and feeding her extravagant meals.

1476712042|4.0|* Warning : This book contains sexual contents, harsh language, violence, relationship issues and drinking issues.<br /><br />Beautiful disaster follows the story of Abby who's trying to escape her past. Together with her best friend, Mare, they went away from her place and settle their college life in Eastern University. But out of all odds, living her life in Eastern U, Abby meet Travis who is an embodiment and reminiscent of her past life. The one that she feared the most.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book Abby created an image of an innocent girl who has a goody-good type of personality. I liked the way how stubborn she can be, how she showcased her man-hater side and on the part where she plays hard to get. After losing a bet with Travis, she keeps worrying about her reputation and all. That part I didn't get. She had a choice and if she wants to have a good reputation then she should have refused. People nowadays( shaking my head).<br /><br />On the course of my reading, Abby's true self was revealed. Her past self. It was sad and I can't blame her for hating Travis. Halfway through the book, she's still in denial of her feelings towards Travis, actually both sides of the party are in denial of their feelings. It was ironic of her to say that nothing's going to happen between Travis and her but It seems like her heart mislead her mind.<br /><br />Travis, on the other side, is a person who fights in floating fight rings to pay his bills, his tuition fee and other stuff that keeps him living. He's an attractive, muscled, tattooed fraternity bad boy who has a BIG attitude. In the first several pages of the book, I've got to admit I liked Travis. He was sweet, cute, and hot. But my thoughts were alternately changing from liking him to not liking him. Yes, he can be sweet and hot but he can be a jerk sometimes. He's abusive, brutal, impatient and immature. When he meet Abby, things changed. Not everything though, his possessive and immature side was still there. But there were aspects in him that changed entirely.<br /><br />Their relationship is like a sail through huge waves. It was tragic, messed up and a beautiful disaster. Both are like magnets. They repel yet at the same time they attract. The emotions were to overboard and that made me tired of their unending fights. One second they fight and another second they make out. Whenever Travis gets upset he wrecks everything arounds him and I see that as a little but too much. Nevertheless, I enjoyed their tragic yet wonderful love story. :)<br /><br />Abby and Travis have their own flaws, like us, and I like how Jamie McGuire took a leap of faith in writing about imperfections. Both characters didn't care less about their flaws. They were in love with each other and that mattered the most for them. See what love can do?<br /><br />The character that made a great impression in me was America. How I wish I have a true friend like her. She's always on Abby's side and never leaves her. She's very supportive and protective in terms of Abby's safety. In the book, there even came to a point that she has chosen her best friend over his boyfriend, Shep. See? Who wouldn't like her anyway?<br /><br />This book started to be really good and interesting but that level of goodness dropped gradually until you reach the end.  But I've got to admit, there was something about Jamie McGuire's writing that kept me on my track. I think it has something to do on how McGuire manage to maintained the mysteriousness about Abby's past. Also, I was dying to know what will happen between Travis and Abby.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster, as a title, perfectly fits the story. Not only that it is also the perfect statement to describe Abby and Travis' relationship. Disastrous yet beautiful at the same time. Their relationship was intense, mad and messed up. No wonder it was entitled that way. Jamie McGuire is a clever writer who depicts real relationship issues.<br /><br />Overall, Even though I gotsome issues about the book I still manage to like it :)

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE , I WAS SHOCKED, BECAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY THAT BEFELL THIS YOUNG LADY. AS THE MOVIE CONTINUED YOU FELT YOU WERE THERE WITH HER AND CHEERING HER ON, NOT TO GIVE UP AND UNDERSTANDING ALL THE FRUSTRATIONS HER, HER PARENTS AND BROTHERS WERE GOING THROUGH, AT FIRST. THEN SELF PITY TURNED INTO COURAGE AND WHAT A CHAMPION THIS GIRL IS! A TRUE STORY. THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES REALLY CAME ACROSS WITH THIS MOVIE. IT IS SO WORTH HAVING IN YOUR COLLECTION OF DVD'S. I ORDERED 4 TOTAL IN ALL, NOT JUST THROUGH AMAZON. BUT FOUND IT ON AMAZON FIRST.GLAD THEY CARRIED IT. SINCERELY, EILEEN HINES

B0084IG7KC|1.0|I tried to enjoy this movie, but can't. For teenagers maybe this movie has an appeal but I don't think it works for more mature audience, myself included. I really can't find anything interesting about this movie. The storyline is flat, plots are weak and the characters are dull. A bunch of kids and teenagers are prepared into fight-to-the-death survival games, and hardly we can see pyschological battles inside each of the characters. Although the story may have an interesting premise to begin with, but the whole production is half-baked and lacking in so many areas.<br /><br />If this is supposed to be a suspense movie, I really can't feel it. The romance part is cheesy and the actions are lame. Many scenes are so superficial and do not make sense. The shaky camera work really makes things even worse.<br /><br />So is this a really bad movie? It is for me. But really, there's no accounting for taste. Just watch it and see if I have summed it up to your favor.
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|I have not read the books but was looking for an interesting movie to watch so got dragged in by the hype surrounding this one.<br /><br />The story line has all been done before and better.  Refer to movies like Battle Royale or The Running Man for the game element and Twilight for the love interest and you are presented with nothing new in this movie.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars as I am giving the trilogy the benefit of the doubt and hoping that this movie is only setting the scene for the real story I would expect from movies 2 and 3.<br /><br />On a positive note I may have been inspired to read the books after watching this movie as I am interested to find out the reasons behind the uprising and why everyone in the Capital is dressed like Lady Gaga and JeanPaul Gaultiers offspring!

IT IMPACTED MY LIFE CONSIDERABLY. I COULD FEEL THE JOY IN THE MAKING OF THIS PROGRAM AND THE INTENSITY AND HARD WORK AS WELL. IT IS AN ART FORM IN ITSELF. I STUDIED IT OVER TWENTY TWO TIMES. ALWAYS WAS INTERESTED IN DANCE FORM. IM STILL GLAD ITS IN MY COLLECTION, THERE IS MUCH BEAUTY IN SEVERAL OF THE NUMBERS. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR YOUNG FOLK BECAUSE OF THE OBVIOUS MOVES IN IT.

B0083SBM7Q|4.0|I cannot pick any other superhero movie better than this one. Well, maybe Watchmen is better in some areas, but for a real family entertainment, Avengers really hits it. The plot is understandably simple but as such, this movie never lacks great actions and hilarious moments. Some jokes and humorous references thrown in here and there really add a real plus to the movie. The CGI is great and Robert Downey's acting is superb as ever.<br /><br />This is simply the best superhero movie in years.

THE MUSIC IS GOOD THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, BUT ITS THE DANCING THAT IS UPLIFTING, ENCOURAGING, NEVER GIVE UP, HARD WORK, AND THE END RESULT IN THE MOVIE, IT SHOWS. IF YOU REALLY LIKE DANCING, THIS SHOULD BE IN YOUR COLLECTION. I LIKE THE THEME SONG, \\"FLASHDANCE\\" ITS INSPIRING.  EILEEN HINES
0345803485|4.0|Ok, so this book isn't written great, but its worth the read. This is just about every girls fantasy! Who wouldn't want to be spoiled and ravaged by a rich, beautiful man?! If your a book critic, you may not want to read this, but anyone else, get through at least the first book. I just started the second, and although the writing hasn't gotten better, the story does. Look past the recurring roles of frequent words and phrases and just fantasise!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this book. It hooked me quickly and kept me reading with all it's twists and turns. The ending was rather anti-climatic, but made me think. Overall, a good read.
B008RTE066|5.0|The death of manager Brian Epstein threw a terrible monkey wrench in The Beatles' machinery in the Fall of '67. The sail that kept their ship on course was gone and thus The Beatles were cut adrift to fend for themselves. However, they continued to delve deeper into the psychedelic music they helped create and came up with the best batch yet, including &#34;I Am The Walrus,&#34; &#34;Hello, Goodbye,&#34; &#34;The Inner Light&#34; and the underrated &#34;Hey Bulldog.&#34; Had these tracks not been relegated to various film scores and B-sides and instead collected to form one Magical Mystery Tour album, the results would've been spectacular, far surpassing their previous milestone SERGEANT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND. But to have an entire set that faithfully reproduces both the original double EP package and the Original film will indeed be a treat. This review will be updated after I've had time to fully appreciate what we have here...in the meantime, here is a letter that I sent to EMI and Paul McCartney years ago. I hope you find it of some interest....this is strictly for fun people so relax! Cheers to the open-minded! Hate to the haters! All aboard!!!!<br /><br />[review of this product to be inserted HERE]<br /><br />.....................................................................<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />Roll the clock back to 1967.....<br /><br />Imagine an alternate reality in which the Beatles were still getting along famously and the group was not disrupted by the sudden death of manager Brian Epstein (to quote George Harrison, &#34;by 1968 the rot had already set in&#34;). Imagine it was acceptable for Beatles record singles to simultaneously appear on their respective albums. Now imagine the Beatles, after just releasing SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, have focused their efforts on making another fantastic album instead of becoming sidetracked by movie projects. Finally in 1968 they emerge with a psychedelic masterpiece to rival SGT. PEPPER'S. The end result is a double album - the definitive MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR album!<br /><br />This revised and expanded collection of classics would consist of material recorded from the first SGT. PEPPER sessions (that didn't appear on that album) up to before THE BEATLES (White album) sessions. This includes all the songs from the original MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (American album/British EP set), the Beatles songs from the original YELLOW SUBMARINE soundtrack, the singles from this time period, plus unreleased instrumental music from the MMT soundtrack recorded by the Beatles. As a special limited edition release, how about a double gatefold vinyl LP mixed for that format (still arguably the best fidelity around today). The cover could be more psychedelic, perhaps in 3-D, the inside could contain special photos and text (why not from the original British double EP?) and maybe even a Beatles adventure/story about an alternate reality that lead to this album.<br /><br />There's really no need for purist Beatles fans to get touchy with a little revisionist history since the whole project was pretty confused from the beginning. Had the Beatles maintained the focus they had with SGT. PEPPER'S they might have created the ultimate psychedelic album. In my view, this little idea of mine would come pretty close to achieving that.<br /><br />With the following collection of songs, you can create one side of 5 songs and 3 sides of 4 songs. The first side could contain the original &#34;Flying&#34; instrumental while each remaining side could include &#34;Flying 2,&#34; &#34;Flying 3,&#34; and &#34;Flying 4.&#34; The extra &#34;Flying&#34; tracks would consist of instrumental soundtrack material recorded by the Beatles and never before released on record (Beatles fans would no doubt love to get their hands on this stuff): &#34;Shirley's Wild Accordion a: Waltz b: Freaky Rock&#34; and &#34;Jessie's Dream.&#34; Thus, you could have 4 sides of 5 songs each. Otherwise, thereare a few other unreleased Beatles cuts that might be worth considering as well. Of course, the &#34;Flying&#34; idea could easily be discarded in favor of sticking strictly to Beatles' songs that have already been released.<br /><br />Immediately following is my recommendation for the running order which I tinkered with and fine tuned extensively before creating my own copy. I found it useful to put 1 of George Harrison's 4 songs as well as original MMT songs on each side.<br /><br />MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR expanded Fourth Dimension edition<br />The album that could have been . . .<br /><br />Side 1:<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour<br />Penny Lane<br />Flying<br />Blue Jay Way<br />Strawberry Fields<br /><br />Side 2:<br /><br />Fool on the Hill<br />Lady Madonna<br />All Together Now<br />Flying 2<br />It's All Too Much<br /><br />Side 3:<br /><br />Flying 3<br />Hey Bulldog<br />Only a Northern Song<br />Baby, You're a Rich Man<br />Your Mother Should Know<br /><br />Side 4:<br /><br />Inner Light<br />Flying 4<br />Hello, Goodbye<br />I Am the Walrus<br />All You Need is Love. Of course, the &#34;Flying&#34; idea could easily be discarded in favor of sticking strictly to Beatles' songs that have already been released.

B008ANFRGQ|5.0|I bought it sight-unseen after getting utterly blown away by \\"Real Illusions: Reflections.\\"  This is part 2 of the \\"Real Illusions\\" story, with part 3 on the way some time in the future.  Absolutely mind-blowing stuff.  Intense, insane, inscrutable at times -- transcendent in so many directions -- You'll get the \\"story of light\\" only while listening to it, and then think about it later and wonder how the hell it all made so much sense at the time.  There is LIGHT in so many forms throughout: from starlight to sunshine, enlightenment to the opposite of light (heavy), moonlight and city light and...  Well, see?  It makes SO much sense while you're listening that you'll feel like someone is opening little advent-calendar doors on the secrets of life, the universe, and everything.  But try to read the liner notes/lyrics, and you'll just think \\"Yes, indeed. These are the rantings of a crazy person.\\"  In fact, I suspect that IS the point of the whole \\"Real Illusions\\" story:  a guy who learns the Truth and it drives him mad.  I can't wait to see how it turns out.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I don't need to tell you Stevie can play and compose, engineer and produce like some kind of supernatural being, right?  Right.

1451627289|5.0|Who doesn't remember where they were when JFK was gunned down in 1963 Dallas?  Wouldn't you want to turn back time to stop his assassination whatever the cost?<br /><br />Stephen King's 11/22/63 is a turbo-paced piece of historical literature that will have many new and old fans worshipping at his altar. His descriptions of the decade surrounding this unforgettable, world-changing event leave you longing for lemonade, sleeveless blouses and capeless heros in convertibles.  Yet all the while thinking how lost we'd be today without Google & geeks to rely on.  King's prose may not be Shakespeare, but hearing his characters sling slang is always a delight to read and even voice aloud.<br /><br />Strap yourselves in for this read. It's a cyclone roller coaster ride between genres and a ride well worth the time travel commitment to 849 pages.  Read it in the hardback edition and build up those biceps as a bonus.

B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter is my go to show when ever I want some fun entertainment with a decent message.  Maybe it is just me but I sort of wish Dexter were real so he could kid the world of some seriously messed up people.  As far as the shows progression, I really feel like the character of Dexter is evolving and changing and taking care of a baby and murdering killers on the side seems to be returning to normal.  Michael C. Hall is doing a terrific job coming through as a strong (but slightly orange at times) character even with all of his personal challenges that he has faced recently. I can't wait for the new season and I really hope the series never ends!

B007R3AZNK|5.0|Joe Bonamassa's new CD, Driving Towards the Daylight is a great mix of songs that is sometimes downright haunting.  One song, \\"Who's Been Talking\\" is funky and even funkier if you see Joe performing it at one of his concerts on the internet.  \\"Dislocated Boy\\" is both a great song and \\"story.\\"  And \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\" is beautiful--a tear jerker!  Good writing, Joe!  Keep it up--we love your writing even though you say you struggle!  This CD will be one of my favorites to play off and on in the future.  What a great talent!

B008K7DIEA|5.0|I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the subconscious mind. Started the book late at night and finished the next morning- couldn't put the book down. I will read it again.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I had heard many stories about the man known as Steve Jobs. As I continued to read this book I became even more aware of him and why he decided to run Apple the way he did. I wasn't crazy about the way he continually 'grabbed' credit for things but I understand the 'closed' unit decree he demanded for Apple products. By creating and maintaining all facets of the product you claim the right to be happy when it all works.<br /><br />Was Steve Jobs a good man? No. Not by any stretch of the imagination. Did he create a good company? Yes, he did to the detriment of family and friends. Today, Apple is a billion dollar company due his technique of running a company. You may not like him as a person but as a person he created a company and a legacy that will be hard to beat.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book I felt the author skipped back and forth too many times but I understand why it had to be done.<br /><br />This IS a good book. If you open it expecting to read about a 'hero' don't waste your money. If you want to find out about the man known as Steve Jobs: Buy this book. You won't be dis-appointed.
B005P5TS5I|3.0|I love supernatural. However, season 7 seemed to drag. The first few episodes that set up the plot line did not have the action and protaganism that is usually expected. i was disappointed with the end of the season. It was fairly obvious that they were going to kill Bobby off. I am hoping that season 8 has more action and strife than was involved in season 7.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater and had high hopes for it.  I like Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth and although I'd heard bad things about Kristen Stewart's acting, I'd never seen any movie she was in so I was hopeful that perhaps rumors of her poor acting had been exaggerated.  Sadly, they were not.  She was truly awful and if this woman is supposed to inspire a kingdom with her beauty and charm, I just didn't see it.  And although she may have had an affair with the director, the editor clearly didn't see it either and she had a very limited speaking role.  Most of her part involved being silent and expressing emotion non-verbally, of which she seems incapable.  Unfortunately, even Charlize Theron, who I hoped would save the film, was awful in this.  Her Queen tended to drone, with every word overly-enunciated as if spoken by a high school thespian.  I think this was supposed to give her character gravitas but instead it gave the impression of overacting.  Chris Hemsworth was good as a man haunted by the death of his wife but even he could not convince me that Snow White was worth believing in.  Plus, as others have mentioned,**SPOILER ALERT***the fact that his kiss awakened Snow White was a plot twist that made zero sense.**END SPOILER ALERT**  I cannot possibly imagine what in this movie was inspiring enough to spawn the apparently impending Snow White and the Huntsman 2, but this is one moviegoer who learned her lesson the first time.  Fool me once, after all.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I love this game but it cost either a lot of money or a lot of time. The game tries every way to get you to spend money. If you want more land to expand for more dragons, the price for in game silver steady increases. I paid 200,000 silver to expand with a 100,000 rock to clear away. To expand again, it is 250,000. I read on the forms it goes up 1,000,000 silver plus to expand for more land. I dread expanding.
0792839730|3.0|This was a film that was lavished with big-name stars, authentic locations, good special effects, cinematography and a director who would go on to win an Oscar.<br /><br />The film covers the Market-Garden operation planned by British Gen. Bernard Montgomery in late '44 to bypass the Siegfried Line, cross the Rhine and win the war in 1944 while the Germans were on the ropes. The film does a decent job of showing the deliberate ignoring of intelligence of powerful German units in the area of Arnhem as well as the planning issues that made it difficult for British paras to capture the bridge across the Rhine. It portrays the courage of allied soldiers well and shows the misfortunes that helped derail the operation.<br /><br />The movie isn't completely accurate and doesn't reflect the effectiveness of Germans in the defense. There were some poingant scenes in the film, but the scene where the elderly Dutch woman trying to hail a taxi is shot by German snipers is simply over the top and silly. I felt some of the individual performances were good, such as Sean Connery's and that of James Caan but, on the whole, you got the feeling that a lot of them were just there for a paycheck and their performances weren't very &#34;inspired&#34; (Ryan Oneil, Robert Redford, Elliot Gould).<br /><br />It's certainly worth a view, but not necessarily worth buying a new copy of this DVD for keeps. It's an &#34;okay&#34; war movie and I give it three stars.

0718154770|5.0|The book was wonderful, after I finally got it.  The meals are all great, not sure about done in 30 minutes, but who really needs them to be.  Jamie is one of my favorite cooks, not only for good food, but sensible eating habits.  He teaches real life lessons.<br />But the shipper is another story--myrockland. It took over a month to arrive and when it did,the package was empty.  They said they would replace, but after two weeks nothing came. I asked for the return of my money and they complied.  I don't know what their problem is...mostly how they ship...but I have to wonder if there was a book sent at all, since the package was still sealed in places.  I will never use that vendor again.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I'm not one for serial killer books anymore (although I did read and review one just a few weeks ago, which was excellent) and I had, at one time, pegged Crouch as a \\"serial killer\\" writer.<br /><br />Ah, how wrong I was.<br /><br />With \\"RUN\\" being perhaps the best book I've read in 2012, I was quite eager to get to \\"PINES\\" and see if he could reach the same level of tension, action, and storytelling he'd crafted in \\"RUN.\\"<br /><br />He could. He did.<br /><br />While I think \\"RUN\\" is still a better book, simply from the emotional wallop at the end, \\"PINES\\" is a very very close second. The beginning is something of a IV drip, just before the red solution slinks its way all the way down the tube and hits the bloodstream with a generous dollop of unputdownable. This is pure literary crack for the action-suspense-mystery junkies. The characters are exceptional, the story addictive,  and the final few chapters are just gob-smacking goodness. At the 33% mark I was writing down what I though the ending might be, and I was evah so glad to be wrong. Burned through the book in two days and I think my girlfriend left me during that time...<br /><br />Crouch is now two for two, and I'm somewhat frustrated with the realization of... it takes time to write these things, and so very little time to burn through them.<br /><br />Very much looking forward to what he's comes up with next. (Just might have to check out some of his short stories...)

0307474259|5.0|As someone who's always been big (thank you, German farm-wife grandmothers), the battle of the bulge is something that's familiar to me. What wasn't familiar was the science behind WHY I was always big.<br /><br />I've struggled to maintain my weight with low-fat diets. I DO have the willpower to eat less, stay away from pop and fast food. But I was always just \\"stuck.\\" And I was always hungry. And boy, did I hate shopping for clothes.  I thought that my genes had conspired to keep me well padded for my whole life, and that's just how it was going to be.<br /><br />But that changed with  this book. Taubes's argument is readable, aggressive, and piles on the anecdotes, medical studies, and literary wisdom to answer the very basic, yet elusive question of \\"why we get fat.\\" It was informative, stunning, and wraps your head around a paradox--that the very thing we're told will kill us is actually what can help to keep us lean and free of chronic disease. Heavy cream instead of fat-free milk. Bacon and eggs rather than cereal and fruit. Butter and steak rather than low-fat dressing and dessert. I had an inkling that this sort of thing was true--after all, I dropped 30 lbs about 10 years ago following the Atkins diet. But it crept back on throughout college and grad school as my eating habits became more lax, and I was convinced by smear science that this sort of diet was harmful.<br /><br />But after a month of following the simple, brief guidelines and a painless loss of 10 pounds and counting, I understand why I've been fat and what I can do to reverse that. My hunger pangs are gone. I no longer have to nap for an hour or two in the afternoon. I don't \\"crash\\" throughout the day, and I don't crave the sweets that I've shoved in my mouth my whole life. Sure, my breath reeks a little, but the side effects of normal ketosis is a small price to pay for the beginnings of a new body and life that people around me are already noticing.<br /><br />Forget what you know about calories in and out. Forget the cheap \\"diet\\" food that clogs the supermarket. Fill up on fat and kiss diabetes, obesity, and chronic disease goodbye.ories in and out.

0375826742|5.0|My 12 year old (11 at the time when he read the entire series) continued on by reading this and the last one which i bought from a different web site. He liked the entire series very much and when he read the last book he was trying to not finish it because then he'd be sad there's no more. If you love to read and you are my kid's age... i def recommend the entire series (4 books). May i add when the teacher introduced the kids to these books the kids were not only racing to see who can read faster but they'd also talk about what they read with such enthusiasm.  i even went  crazy calling all the libraries around me looking to continue since the books i had ordered were delayed.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I grew up knowing that a women could do anything and be anything because of Margaret Thatcher . Meryl Streep is amazing actor and was able to show THE IRON LADY as a real person. A great movie -- now we just need more women in this role ...
0439023483|3.0|I read this book while travelling on a short work trip and finished the book in a couple of days due to some hefty delays.  While it was entertaining enough it really wasn't anything special. At the end of the book it leads heavily into the next book of the series and frankly I didn't feel it was worth it to continue on to Catching fire. For me the biggest problem I have with the book is that the action wasn't the main focus but was the most interesting part, the character development and love story were weakly written. I didn't feel I cared about any of the characters. Also, the back story of Panem was very lacking in detail and I would have liked the book to explore this more and paint a better picture of the world the story was set in. With all that said I am still glad I read the book if only to understand what others have been talking about and get the pop culture references. I can ultimately say it is a good read but it isn't any better than dozens of other books dealing with a similar story lines that are practically unknown in comparison. I suppose what I don't understand is what made this book so popular?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read countless books and I stayed clear of this one until I heard how absolutely &#34;amazing&#34; it was...yeah, it's amazing...amazingly bad. One of the worst books I ever read. I finished reading it only because I thought it had to get better, after all, it was a best seller...and how in the world was it rated that? What a waste of time, I could have been reading something that was actually interesting and written by someone who had the ability to write.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I could not give this book 1 star, because it was actually a great book, very well written, witty and unpredictable. But I could not give it 5 stars because I hated this book. It was full of horrible people doing horrible things, not a single feel good thing about this story. 1/3 of the way in I wanted to quit reading it, but I gave it some more time to see what happened, by the 2/3 mark I wanted to quit reading it even more but just had to see what happened. So I split the difference and gave it 3 stars.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this game when it was a free app of the day a few months ago, and promptly forgot about it. A few days ago I wanted to play a game and came across it in my apps list and remembered that it sounded interesting, so I opened it.<br />Instantly I was hooked. This game is super fun, extremely time-consuming, and has a good difficulty level. It eases you into it, and if you get frustrated with a certain level, you can skip around as much as you want.<br />I also like to switch between this and the color version, which was coincidentally the free app of the day the day after I started playing this one. Switching between helps me get better at both of them, and they are both just so fun!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took 40% on the kindle for me to actually get into the story which to me is a lot of reading before enjoying a book. I did not mind it going back/forth between the two characters telling their side as I find that to be a good technique. Up to that point I did not think the story/book was well written. I felt the book was going nowhere and found it boring. I found that I wanted to begin skimming through the pages. I like to finish books but every once in awhile I give up. I like the storyline to be gripping from the getgo and this book did not do that for me. I almost caved in....but someone said to keep going that it was 'very' good and I did just that. This book received a lot of hype and I was one of those that did not find the book that great. Movies of this nature are called 'Black Comedy.'  If anyone has seen the old movie 'War of Roses'.... this book is very simmilar. One suggestion that I would make is to read a sample of this book online or on your kindle. If you like what you have read....then go for it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Book was easy reading.  First part was a little slow, but the second part picked up tremendously, and made the book worth reading.  I would and have recommended this book.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I couldnt put it down. I love how the characters develop. I cant wait to read the book from Travis' perspective! This is exactly the kind of book I like. The rocky relationship and chemistry between Abby and Travis is addicting. I will be reading this more than once for sure! This book has love, romance, a little action, but the intensity is what really kept me going. Its for those of us that arent quite young adult, but not really interested in the \\"adult\\" books, and a love story out of high school and without the erotism that tends to present in the adult romance books. I cant wait for this book to be made into a movie, I only hope they dont ruin it!

B003O86FMW|2.0|So far this book is terrible! I did not read the whole thing, but I think Suzanne Collins should really stop writing to many words that are'nt even necessary in the book (although I like the part where they start killing other people in district 11, but this is mostly the reason I rate this book 2 stars)!!! I want to get to the horror, romance, and fighting really fast!!! MAN, I hope this book gets better, and if it dosent, what a ripoff that I bought this book for just $5.99!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed reading the trilogy of the books from beginning to the end. The story is a fantastic love story that keeps you wanting to read more and more.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love this book because of 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. Because of too many violence.<br /><br />2. Because of too many brutal actions in the book.<br /><br />3. Because of many executions.<br /><br />What I did not like about his book is the beginning and end because of lack of entertainment, but still, I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!…<br /><br />P.S: I am very sorry amazon people because I wrote a review that did not even involve much of the book last time and that you erased it.

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|We Need To Talk About Kevin is a beautifully written story. Shriver takes a controversial subject and approaches it with brave, honesty. Some might say the characters are hard to like, but I found them to be incredibly real. If you have any interest in the nature vs. nurture debate, this is an excellent story to check out. Shriver presents this topic to the reader without really giving up definite answers and instead allows the reader to make their own interpretation. I love the tension that Shriver slowly builds throughout the book and I was truly blown away with the ending. We Need To Talk About Kevin is a dark and disturbing tale, that won't be for everyone. For me, it has become one of my all time favorite books and I find myself thinking of it often.
0375836675|4.0|I love Markus Zusak. His writing is poignant! Really captures the essence of life. Ed, the main character, has an impeccable and humourous voice throughout. This is truely an original story. However, I agree with the one reviewer, J. Welch. The ending was puzzling. I would reccomend this book though. It shows small slices of human life and meanings in such simplest forms, it's beautiful.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game. takes previous levels to help you reward yourself with new levels. uses points as money so don't think you have to pay for anything.

B004QL7K6G|5.0|This movie was so freaking funny we had to buy it! It was a non thinking movie and the characters were well chosen. I love Jennifer and she was great as well. I am in my 40's and not into the teen movies or chick flicks but this is one well worth seeing. Simple as that. You want to laugh this will have you laughing. Some of the scenes Paul Rudd did had me in tears laughing. Now the word \\"Dick\\" has so much more meaning!!! Just simple comedy
0553801473|4.0|George R. R. Martin has been compared to Tolkein, primarily because he borrows heavily from Tolkein's mythology (and openly admits as much).  I prefer to think of Martin as Tolkein's evil twin: wherein THE LORD OF THE RINGS was ultimately an optimistic, life-affirming journey, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is its nihilistic counterpart, determined to present a blood-soaked world where anything and everything can--and will--happen.<br /><br />A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, Book 5, more-or-less occurs simultaneously with Book 4 (though it overtakes it in the last couple hundred pages).  We're presented here with characters missing from the previous book: Daenerys, ruling a city besieged by outside armies and murderers within; Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Watch, slowly beginning to understand the terror that is approaching, and the evils he must face within his own command; Theon Greyjoy, betrayer of the Starks, has become captive of Ramsey Bolton, and lives in quaking fear of his captor's shadow, even as Bolton makes plans to bring rival King Stannis to his knees; Tyrion Lannister, heading across the sea a fugitive and kinslayer, joined with a band of men who are more than they appear; Quentyn Martell, Dornish Prince, on a secret mission of his own.  These paths and more will converge, and blood will spill, fire will erupt--and yes, winter is coming.<br /><br />If DRAGONS has a flaw, it's this: by now, there are so many darn characters, it's hard to care about all of them.  Martin's world is intricate and well-planned; he covers every detail he possibly can, which can be a bit tedious in spots (okay, a lot of spots).  The story has to be this complex, of course--that's what helps ground everything, even the magic, in reality.  Thus, it's a forgivable flaw, though readers will certainly find the going a little slow in spots.  Tension still mounts, of course--if anything, that's what keeps fans coming back: where is Martin going with this?  No one really knows except Martin himself, of course, but we can be certain on one thing: it's not going to be a happily ever after.of course, but we can be certain on one thing: it's not going to be a happily ever after.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|A frightening true story that gave me the chills.  I found the evil behavior of some policemen, doctors, etc. unforgiving. They put Christine Collins ( missing boys mother ) through sheer torture. Too bad they cast Angelina in the role of Christine Collins.  I never considered Angelina Jolie as a good actress. I always found her acting bland and boring. But, excluding her -- the movie was well directed, etc. etc. etc. Kudos to Clint Eastwood.

B000KGGIQY|5.0|I liked the story and the actors. A few parts were comical, some sad, and some heartwarming. Joaquin Phoenix is terrific in his part as Johnny Cash. ( hard to believe that Joaquin's singing is so like Johnny's.  Reese Witherspoon as June Carter is a cute sweetheart to say the least. I am happy that Johnny and June tied the knot. They were truly meant for one other.  This dvd was much to my liking.

0307592731|5.0|I loved this book.  I initially read this book in Book Club and then ordered another copy and sent it to my daughter.  We both hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in the Jefferson Wilderness area so the book was emotional for me.  A very good read!  (Not just a chick book, my husband enjoyed it as well).
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I recommend this game.  It's a lot of fun and makes you think.  It is easy enough for a child of any age to play with it.

B00000AFGM|5.0|Without a doubt, this album by Marilyn Manson is a big part of musical culture. It contains every element that a famous album needs (great songs, a strong message...if not many, iconic cover art, and of course: a true artist on vocals). Portrait of an American Family (MM's first album) is like a handful of needles, Anti-Christ Superstar (MM's 2nd album) is the soundtrack to the apocalypse, and now Mechanical Animals is a smooth spaceship ride through the galaxies. All the songs have an electronic, somewhat science fictional sound to them...adding a brilliant atmosphere. This album has hard tracks (Rock is Dead, New Model No. 15, I Want to Disappear), and very emotional tracks (The Speed of Pain, The Last Day on Earth, Coma White). Personally, I like the emotional tracks...whenever I'm feeling down or lonely they just bring comfort to all of my feelings and make me feel as if I'm not alone! To call Marilyn Manson a musician is a major understatement, even calling him a ROCK GOD seems insulting. I can lay in bed and put on Mechanical Animals, and I will feel myself floating to a peaceful place far away. Thank you so much MM, you are my favorite man alive and I wish for you to continue releasing divine albums!!!<br /><br />Song ratings:<br />Great Big White World: 4.5/5<br />The Dope Show: 5/5<br />Mechanical Animals: 3.5/5<br />Rock is Dead: 5/5<br />Disassociative: 2.5/5<br />The Speed of Pain: 4.5/5<br />Posthuman: 4/5<br />I Want to Disappear: 3.5/5<br />I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me): 4/5<br />New Model No. 15: 4.5/5<br />User Friendly: 3/5<br />Fundamentally Loathsome: 2.5/5<br />The Last Day on Earth: 4/5<br />Coma White: 5/5

0061733199|5.0|This is a great book IMO. It has many different solutions for many of the problems a survivor would face. Like shelter designs, ways to obtain food and water, making a fire ect... Many of these I have seen before, but their were a few I didn't know about or would have thought of until I read this book. IMO there is good and bad in any survival book, but if a person can learn one thing that later saves their life in a real survival situation the good outweighs the bad. I believe that the good far outweighs any bad that could be said about this book. This book offers usable information that could help anyone in a survival situation.

B001KQZ7I8|2.0|The first part of the book was well-written, poignant and interesting.  However the second part was pendantic and thus boring.

0679722610|4.0|In prohibition-era Personville, Continental Op (what a great name for a character!) has been hired to learn who murdered the son of the czar of the town.  Nicknamed \\"Poisonville,\\" its a city riddled with corruption and graft.  Continental Op speedily resolves the case, but is subsequently hired to \\"clean up the town.\\"  In doing so, a veritable blood-bath ensues, hence the title.  (I had originally assumed the title was a reference to the IWW and labor disputes - it turned out it was a red herring if you will pardon the pun.)<br /><br />The plot is fast-paced and typical Hammet as Continental Op pits one crook agains another in a widening circle of violence - ultimately over 20 characters are murdered.  What really makes the book, though, isn't the resolution of the conflict, but (as with all of Hammet's stories), his dialouge.  And while its a bit dated, it is classic noir: (what follows, in spite of appearances, is not a spoiler)<br /> \\"... Dinah told me  you were a pretty good guy, except kind of Schotch with the roll.\\"<br />\\"I had a nice visit.  Will you tell me what you know about Donald Willsshon's killing?\\"<br />\\"His wife plugged him.\\"<br />\\"You saw her?\\"<br />\\"I saw her the next second - with the gat in her hand.\\"<br /><br />Hammet's description of action is also priceless: \\"Pat twisted us around a frightened woman's coupe, put us through a slot between street cara nd laundry wagon - a narrow slot that we coudln't have slipped through if our car hadn't been so smoothly enameled and said, 'All right, but the brakes aren't so good.'\\"<br /><br />This was my first Continental Op story.  It won't be my last.  While he's not as well developed a character as Sam Spade, I much prefer Continental to his Nick and Nora - maybe its a west coast thing, but Hammet's San Francisco characters are much more interesting to me than those set in New York.  In broad terms, you can't go wrong with anything by Dashiell Hammet, and _Red Harvest_ has all the elements one expects and loves about his writing.  Recommended.loves about his writing.

030758836X|5.0|I won't summarize, as plenty exist. But I'll add my voice to the list of people highly recommending this book! It's definitely the best I've read this summer. It's fast-paced and well written, with defined characters. It's not a book that fits neatly into one category; not wholly a crime novel, but not just about a marriage either. It's a bestseller for a reason--you can't put it down!
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I can't think of one song that I dislike on this CD. It almost feels like a story as some songs seem to go faster as if racing towards an ending. Too, the songs bring out the sound of my stereo and really make me appreciate my B&W speakers. I think my favorite song is \\"anything we want\\". Hot Knife is very unique.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I will have to say that, I couldn't stop reading, maybe because the relationship with this two characters was so disturbing, not sure -  trying to imagine how would I put up with it, even if someone was that rich...slightly sadistic... and abusive.  I think I got through the trilogy so fast, because I skipped a lot of sex scenes, they were repetitive and boring, after the first one, well is pretty much the same.  My wish is that there were more drama with the entire cast, because it seems like the only time I was excited is when something aside of all the sex happened.  I know I wasted money, I get to do that once in a while.  My recommendation is to save your money, wait for the movie and hope they cast this baby right, can't imagine how this movie would not get a rated XXX... I gave it three stars because it kept me reading, but the reality is that is just okay... can't wait when we get a book that have more substance in it... aside of the abuse relationship and controlling this two characters are in... \\"What's love got to do with it\\".

0316743003|5.0|This is the book that every engineer should read, the sooner the better. And by engineers I also mean engineers who manage engineering departments that are focused on advanced Research & Development (R&D) projects. This book may mainly be related to aerospace / military history but the lessons to be learned, both in engineering and management, apply to many other fields. Those lessons are invaluable, timeless and straight to the point. It is a pity that many organizations are well beyond the point to turn back and consider those lessons seriously to make a difference and real impact.

081297381X|4.0|The wife was loose in the mall. There IS a normal bell curve distribution of results. When faced with probable outcomes beyond control it is best to hunker down in shelter. And so it was I found myself in the refuge of the tiny mall bookstore with zero expectancy. The titles, including in the minuscule \\"Investing\\" section, seemed filtered by some algorithm designed to help pay the rent by selling the most to the least. White swans aplenty. Except for that little paperback, titled like a misplaced novel, way up in the top corner.<br /><br />Coming upon Taleb's Black Swan turned out to be an improbable delight. Humans seem wired to grossly underestimate risk and the impact of rare but entirely possible events. It probably had to be that way or our progenitors would not have been so foolhardy to leave mother ocean. It probably has to remain that way today or you and I would never drive vehicles in traffic or allow our hearts to fully \\"take a chance on love\\". Faced with inevitable uncertainty, \\"Sailor Dunc\\" would hesitate getting up, let alone leave the dock.<br /><br />In trading such paralysis is fatal, while, on the other hand, the bliss of ignorance helps speed natural selection. The outliers are waiting! Nassim's book is about that. And it's a riot. An experienced trader and intellectual of self-proclaimed rarefied classical refinement, Professor Taleb seems to have offended many of that (latter) ilk with his scathing wit and provocative  pronouncements.<br /><br />No matter. Traders are pragmatists. The book's placement under \\"Investing\\" was bang on. The take home message is sorely needed. Such sacrilege as \\"...learn not to use the markets as warehouses of value\\". Taken to heart, the lessons of Black Swans will help one survive far more than the mall.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|A fairly interesting story that has a fair amount of action and is entertaining enough to hold one's attention to the end.  It does get a little slow and the narrative gets quite whiney in the middle book, but it tries to make up for it with some gory action.  I dont know how or why, but lately the forces of the universe have led me to read several books narrated in the voice of petty, manipulative teenage girls...and quite frankly, the whineyness factor of teenage girls can be excruciating.  But aside from the selfishness of the protagonist and her heroic deeds that seem to suprise even her (even though the voice is first person), it is worth the read if you get the trilogy for the kindle.
1400067936|4.0|In summer, I sail. It get's me away from trading. And one of life's most looked forward to pleasures is a good book in a quiet anchorage. Alas often about trading but never mind. Pleasure is pleasure. Having run into Nassim Taleb's later work \\"The Black Swan\\", last year (see review), I choose the new edition of his earlier contribution, \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" as one of this summers special reads. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I found the Black Swan more succinct and message more powerful. \\"Fooled\\" at times seems written, well, somewhat randomly. But then Taleb tells us it was written for fun and fun it is. But don't let that fool you, either. This is serious stuff. Taleb has done us a service in adding his own eclectic thoughts to how we human's deal with uncertainty and chance. The fact he has experienced and reflected deeply on MARKET uncertainty and chance makes it of course irresistible for the likes of me. For this is no flaccid orthodox Random Walk Down anywhere rehash. No these are reflections from a Trader who knows damn well there are imbalances and opportunities aplenty for the astute, careful and the, um, lucky.<br /><br />If we are not wired (nor financialy modelled) to adequately weigh risk and rare events (Black Swan) we seem so evolved to navigate and give meaning to life beset with uncertainty and chance that we barely notice it. There-in hides the dangers, some of them quite surprising. Our own tiny sample sets of unique experience color (blind?) our every perception. A trader faced with a huge windfall exaggerates (typically) his prowess at the expense of what ever role chance (also) played in it. Such illusion of course can cost a lot of money. Rewarded and vindicated you keep emulating your rear mirror moves. But the complex conditions ahead fail to replay, on time, just so. In the book Taleb mentions he struck gold fairly early through being very aggressively on the short side of his market in a crisis. Guess what kind of trading stance he pursed ever since?<br /><br />Taleb also makes a profound case on the inseparable roles of emotion and fact based reasoning in decision making. What a departure from the psycho babble of the many Guru's who emphasize the need to strip away all emotions in making trading decisions. Their points are valid for the sense intended (shouts at the TV don't effect which side scores either). Taleb however will take you to a bedrock place where one without the other for human's = paralysis. Like many of the vignettes and angles of this book, it's great food for thought.<br /><br />In choosing which author to spend my summer anchorages with I of course browsed the ever generous amazon reviews. I chuckled over how Nassim's style and disdainful persona grated on some. I take it all in good fun. He'd be a pedantic bore if not a character. But I can see in places why some offence. Indeed, in the interesting add-on material to the new edition, Nassim rails at the writers of these very reviews! We undoctored peons, it would seem, are not worthy passing negative judgments on the ideas of DR. Taleb. But one is brought to forgive when he reveals he is only showing us, at his own expense, how feelings cannot be separated from perception and reaction. He confides he is equally pleased by POSITIVE complements no matter the \\"qualifications\\". As such the full  weight of my 1984 two week sailing certificate (it's here somewhere) stand squarely behind this thumbs up and four grateful stars.pursed ever since?<br /><br />Taleb also makes a profound case on the inseparable roles of emotion and fact based reasoning in decision making.

B002M3GPOI|5.0|I keep writing this in reviews - these 5.1 mixes of all these old albums are phenomenal. You can have been listening to these albums for years - practically your entire life - and it's like hearing them again for the first time. Just that is worth the money for me.
B000068TPN|5.0|I was happy with the Widescreen Edition. It wasn't quite clear to me the difference between the regular version and the Widescreen Edition when I was ordering so I took a chance on the Widescreen and liked my choice.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|I've said it before, I'm saying it now, and I'll say it again in a few minutes on another review: I love these 5.1 mixes. I am by no means an audiophile, I don't have Monster Cables, I have decent speakers and a nice receiver, and the quality improvement is undeniable. You can hear details on these discs that you didn't even know was there, even on album you've been listening to for 20-30 years.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game proves to be a great brain teaser in times of boredom! While the lower levels are ridiculously easy, it gets much more challenging further on.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Fun fun fun fun. Highly addictive. Especially if you live in your parents basement and work odd jobs like I do leaving plenty of time for Wheat Thins and Jetpack Joyride
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I downloaded this app the other day because my wife was playing it with others on her IPad. For some reason today I wasn't getting her drawing back,then her user name disappeared. This totally sucks so I removed it from my kindle fire!
B003ES5JDS|5.0|I am 42, my sons 8 and 5.  We all enjoyed this movie.  Was a lot of fun to watch together.  Will watch again sometime later on.
B001TD1XWG|4.0|This is a Rock concept album from someone who is known exclusively for Hip-Hop.  No you are not getting a hip-hop album.  You ARE getting a great albumin that features different varieties of Rock 'n Roll.  Its a hip-hop attempt at rock that ranges from 50's pop rock to metal songs.  Not many people are doing concept albumns anymore. If other artists can come close to matching this quality, then I say they should do them more.  I definitely recommend checking this album out. It's not my favorite but I recognize  the attempt and really appreciate it.
143911000X|1.0|This is a book for a 6th grader and do not recommend this. Waste of time and of anybody's money that buys this book.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|This was a gift for a graduate and she loved it.  She reads her Kindle daily and says the cover is very user friendly.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Whether you believe in one God or not, the story of one man's undeniable call to do a difficult and extremely dangerous work is so powerful. His family's story is a beautiful, touching, well performed drama.
030758836X|1.0|Reading this novel was like having a tooth pulled.  I kept expecting it to get better but it didn't.  Characters lacked depth and what was offered was poor character development.  You know nothing more about each character at the end as with the beginning.  I only finished reading it because it was a gift and I know I will be asked how I liked it.  Hated it!  The author has a very psychotic personality herself or she is delusional.  Chapters of 1 page, who needs that?  I can only think of two other books that have disappointed me like this one and again I finished each thinking they would at least get better and did not. The conclusion was truly a sorry, misplaced ending.  Story so totally out in left field it cannot begin to be accepted as believable.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book over a month ago and I still feel the love shared.  Thankfully it wasn't the typical sappy love story but one with a lot of heartfelt meaning.  If this story is made into a movie I would love to see who they cast as Travis. I would vote for Channing Tatum anytime :)  Great read!
B006LSZECO|1.0|horrible ending.  i couldnt like or relate to any of the chacters.  i kept on hoping it would get better but it didnt.

B007STXHTM|5.0|After trying to film underwater using the stock waterproof housing, I found the camera simply couldn't focus on any of the fish/underwater creatures/coral/etc.  I came across a helpful comparison of what the GoPro's video quality looks like with the stock housing versus this Dive Housing, and was really impressed.  You can watch the video here: [...].  So, I figured the thing was worth $80 and I'm so glad I bought it in time for my shark dive excursion off the North Shore in Oahu, Hawaii.  The quality was incredible and sharper than anything I've seen in such a small camera.  We all know the GoPro is a great camera, but coupled with this dive housing, it's an even better underwater rig.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for anyone with a Hero 2 that has any desire to shoot under water.
034547581X|5.0|Devotion. Honor. Duty. Leadership. Selflessness. Courage. Unquestioning loyalty. Regardless of the merits of the war - this book tells the story of young men who performed their duty to their utmost. It does what few books do - it lets you in to the lives of all the characters, to varying degrees.  And it follows up on many of them after the war and/or the battle. It covers the home front as well.  It is, as one reviewer noted, heavy on military terminology, but it doesn't detract - if anything, it adds to the story for those that can easily understand it. For those that don't, it's not a distraction in the least. The book is graphic without being gratuitous. It honors those who fought the war - on both sides. And it touches on the realities of the war - the political dilemmas and policy failures, but it doesn't do it in a critical way, but as observations by one who was at the mercy of those policies. I saw the movie and loved it. And the book is so much better, more engaging, and - literally - awesome. The Vietnam War may have been misguided, but few can doubt the courage and dedication of those who were asked to fight this war. This book pays great honor to those young men - both those who fell and those who survived.
1595825045|5.0|WOW! it´s a must have wheter you ara a fan or not, the designs, the concept art, everything, i´m really happy with this product.
030746363X|5.0|I've been on his Slow Carb system for about a month and I've dropped 4% body fat. If nothing else, the book is an entertaining way to gain insight into how your body works and how often medical advise is based on nothing
0307730697|5.0|I first heard about Adam Brown from the NRA Life of Duty documentary about him. I was amazed at the apparent paradox between what was apparently an incredible warrior and an even greater family man and friend. I have always enjoyed reading about our soldiers and understanding just a little of the sacrifices they make.<br /><br />In many ways I got this book expecting to hear some about who Adam Brown was and a lot of information about his skills as a DEVGRU SEAL. I was delightfully incorrect.<br /><br />This book is almost solely about the character that Adam had, the bonds of addiction he escaped from, his unbreakable spirit, and most importantly, a man who placed all his faith in Jesus. The book is in many ways a three part love story: Adam's love for his savior, the love shared between Adam, Kelley, and their kids, and the love of Jesus binding them all together and sustaining them through trial after trial and ultimate loss.<br /><br />Man or woman, you will read this book and come away better, whether you learn from Adam, Kelley, or both.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I Love, Love, Love, the Vampire Diaries Series.  I wasn't sure if I would like this type of show at first, but you immediately get sucked in to the characters. I can't wait for season 4 to begin.
0425263908|5.0|This was a good book, very close to 50 Shades!  Can't wait for the rest of them series to come out
B007RTAR64|5.0|The doll is amazing looks just like Catness .  Great addition to my doll collection.  I hope you do Peeta and other characthers. She is on display in my doll room.  Great job on this one.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down and as a woman I did get a little bored especially when the dog talks about NASCAR/race car lingo and such. I have to admit I did rush my reading when it came to those parts, but i loved how I can relate Enzo's actions throughout the book because I also have a dog. It was funny and heart warming, the ending could of been better, I felt like the author wanted to just to get it over with and it left me saying: \\"really!?\\"  but I couldn't think of a better ending.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I love this movie! I only bought it for 1 cent. Yes that's right 1 cent! And paid a few bucks for shipping and handling. It was in great condition, no scratches, it didn't skip at all. Love amazon. I highly recommend buying items on here. Never had a problem with anything I purchased.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator all the time for finances and the likes. It is easy to use and never glitches. Two thumbs up :)
B005LZW8FO|4.0|A profoundly moving film about tragedy and second chances, \\"Another Earth\\" is science fiction in only the broadest sense (in fact it truly is a fantasy)--out of the blue we see another Earth in the sky. Is it some sort of bizarre mirror image due to a fluke in physics or could it truly be a parallel world with a door that has just opened for both them and us? The science for those that care about it is sketchy to say the least as the film ignores the impact of having another planet the size of Earth in our solar system and how the close planet might impact our tides, gravity, etc. Instead, director Mike Cahill uses the story as a metaphor for his themes.<br /><br />If you're looking for a science fiction adventure or one that focuses on the other Earth that mysteriously appears in the sky, \\"Another Earth\\" is the wrong movie for you. If you're looking for a drama that doesn't answer all the questions posed, deals with the themes of loss and the complexity of relationships, than \\"Another Earth\\" is for you.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />For Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling who also co-wrote the film)when that doorway between us and them occurs it  provides for the possibility of hope and second chances. Rhoda has just been released from prison after serving a sentence for manslaughter when, after celebrating her acceptance to MIT, drunkenly hits another car killing the family of a composer John Burroughs(William Mapother)and leaving him in a coma. Four years later Rhoda is adrift and feels the need to apologize to Burroughs. When she visits him she finds he is as much adrift and lost as she is. She lies to him telling him that she is with a cleaning service and offering a free trial cleaning. He takes her up on it and they begin a complex relationship as a result. Meanwhile, Rhoda applies to travel on a private expedition to Earth 2 to find out if it is real and if, as many believe, it parallels our world with other versions of us there.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Another Earth\\" although it's pacing is a bit slow (not that unusual for an Indie film which focuses less on rapid cutting styles and more on mood and character). The performances by Marling and Mapother are exceptionally good.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks quite an inconsistent but largely decent looking transfer. There is considerable video noise evident The film was shot in 720p (and upscaled)and, as a result, it isn't going to exhibit a huge jump up from the look of a DVD but it does look better than the DVD on average. Although there are flaws the movie, on the whole, looks good.<br /><br />The audio is quite good although keep in mind this isn't an action film so dialogue and music clarity are the priority here.<br /><br />There are deleted scenes (including a scene that suggests how Earth 2's gravity might impact our world although it is quite unbelievable). We also get a music video by Fall on Your Sword the group that scored the film. We also get featurettes with Marling, Mapother and director Cahill discussing the making of the film. Finally we get a featurette where Marling and Cahill sit down with a astrophysicist to discuss alternate universes, worlds and what it means to us. The trailer is included upscaled to 1080p.<br /><br />If you keep in mind that \\"Another Earth\\" is a drama about consequences, loss and second chances rather than the planet mentioned in the title, you'll enjoy this drama.

B005LAIHQS|4.0|let me start off by saying this movie did not start off well. it was really bad for like 10 minutes but after that it was like WOW what just hit me. afterthat i was totally into it. will smith is great but who is even better is tommy lee jones. he really makes the movie. this has everything u want in a movie. comendy, action and some romance. if you do get the chance to watch this movie it will not dissappoint. also you might even cry at the end it has a great story and plot twist so look out.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Complete waste of money and time.  The writing was not good, the story very boring and unprofessional and besides that it is sick.  It should be rated so people will know what they are getting.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The game is really fun to play but it takes so much battery for a game that simply shouldn't.  Riptide GP (a 3d high performance game)  uses much less battery than this game, but I'm guessing they will fix this.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have this game on my ipod it is awesome. it has amazing stuff.  I love jetpack joyride. it is cool.
0345803485|2.0|Look at the ruins of Pompeii and you'll see that we have always been obsessed with sex. There's nothing new about porn.  It comes in many varieties:  drawn; sculpted; portrayed on film; written; etc.  So, FIFTY SHADES OF GREY is no exception.<br /><br />After being told by numerous friends that I just had to read it, I bought the trilogy.  And frankly, not being a prude, I anticipated enjoying all the titillating tidbits I'd been told about.  The problem is, I expected too much.<br /><br />For innovative sex, E. L. James' books get five stars.  The quality of writing, however, barely rates one star.  The story line lacks.  It's reminiscent of a thinly veiled porn film that needs an outline to follow in order to insert numerous gratuitious sexploits.  This reads more like teen-romance-meets-Mr. (S and M) Right.<br /><br />In Brief:<br />* Theme  S & M  sex<br />* Plot  Predictable<br />* Readability  Poor<br />* Target Audience:  Teen & above<br />* Character Development  Nearly non-existent<br />* Narrative  Unimaginative except for sex<br />* Dialogue  Lacks authenticity<br />* Well-Researched  Excellent<br />* Page-Turner  Only if you're searching for the sexy parts<br />* Pacing  Intermittently boring<br /><br />Ms. James will read her critics' reviews and laugh--all the way to the bank.  She's now a new millionaire, thanks to our latest foolish book purchases.
034580404X|5.0|Couldn't decide if I wanted to order all 3 books or just the first one.  Glad I ordered the 3, it was a good decision because I am now almost finished with the 2nd one.  It really is what they claim, erotic love story.  I can't wait to see what the last one enfolds in the lives of these two people.  I highly recommend it to all ladies who love a good erotic love story along with some suspense.
B001HZK8FY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I think it is definitely the best romantic story I've ever seen. I've watched it countless times and it still brings me to tears. So timeless and beautiful. Everyone dreams of finding a love like Noah and Ali had.<br />I highly recommend getting the Limited Edition Gift Set. It has lots of pictures,a scrapbook, bookmarks, note cards,and stickers. A nice collector's set. A must have for anyone who loves this movie like I do
B0071BY2OG|4.0|If you're a Valentino Rossi fan you'll love this video, as a good portion of it is his biography.  If you're not a VR fan, the rest of the video is still pretty good too.  Maybe not quite as good as \\"Faster\\", it's still a very entertaining look at MotoGP.
B006J420UE|5.0|This is a great processor for my needs. The highest I can get it to run is 76%. Every move is very crisp and no crashes yet. It has been running for almost a week now. Most of my work doesn't use more than 2 cores but when I really try to load it, it just works.
B008BM9L72|4.0|The book was better than I expected! To me it was like a fairy tale! The handsome rich guy and the innocent young woman that catches his attention and then gets \\"educated\\" by him in all things. The book made me see my relationship in a whole new light and that new things are not always taboo!!! Will definately read it again (and again)!
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I bought Forbidden Planet on blu ray after getting a new TV. I am a huge sci fi fan and have every other movie out there including Star Wars/Star Trek. I was a big fan of the Lost in Space TV show and other old sci fi flicks so I thought I would give this one a try. I'm 22 years old, my 75 year old dad loves this movie and I see him watching it on TV when it's on so I took a shot and bought it on blu ray.<br /><br />Number one, AMAZING movie, especially for the 1950's. The funky sound effects, set design, story, acting, very excellent for such an old movie. If you want more on the movie alone you can go on wiki or IMDB for more on the movie. Regarding the blu ray disc, I LOVE IT! Superior, crystal clear picture and sound. I'm amazed how well it looks for the old cameras. Some older movies/shows I have on blu ray do not have widescreen, but this does, and it looks good. Also, the whole film has that \\"film grain\\" sci fi quality. It's not too over the top and it compliments the feel of a classic sci fi movie well.<br /><br />The surround sound is great, deep thumping bass, channels mixed fairly well although it's not going to sound like a new movie. Some parts you can tell the recording/mixing equipment wasn't up to where it is today, but it is still very good for the 1950's. Also, this came with \\"The Invisible Boy\\", a whole second movie in black and white with Robby the Robot. I only watched bits and pieces so far but its interesting. I don't know/think this add-in was remastered in anyway although it was in widescreen and the quality was excellent.<br /><br />$13 bucks? You can't beat it, I say this is a must have for your blu ray collection. Now if you are one of those people that own this movie in six different formats of DVD/VHS/whatever maybe you are skeptical and if you like what you have you don't need to waste more money. But I will say if you don't own this movie already it's definitely worth checking out whether you like sci fi movies or not.

0307730697|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this book while driving.  At the end, I found myself crying while driving down the freeway in Southern California.  Such an inspiring story.  Made me feel proud to be an American and a Christian.

B00690IC1Y|5.0|This is the best boy band of all time. I love all the songs. I listen to \\"Invisible\\" everyday. This song shows how I feel about a girl at a certain point in my emotions. \\"Invisible makes me wanna cry\\". \\"Time Of Our Life\\" makes me wanna party all night long. Best dance song ever. This cd is great for people of all ages. Big Time Rush gives very positive messages. I love this cd so much.
034580404X|3.0|This is for sure a woman's fantasy.  She falls in love with a man who looks gorgeous, is wealthy, and needs her to fix him.  And she is the only one who can do it!  She never has to cook, clean, or think.  He showers her with gifts unasked.  The gifts are always what she wants; jewlry and clothes.  He finds her irresistable and he is seemingly dangerous, but she makes a loving man out of him.  He is exciting because he can fly a helicopter and takes her to beautiful sunrises, he can drive multiple fancy and fast cars.  He even gives her one.  His family, her in-laws, are loving and kind to her and all her friends marry his siblings so she has them around her forever. The sex is always above good and he always thinks about pleasing her first before himself.  They both have unlimited time to spend with each other and to write on e-mail to each other.  He is adventurous and imaginative in everything he does.  He is admired by the community and takes her to dress-up affairs all the time  This was an enjoyable bit of fluff and probably helped a lot of women have great sex while reading it because they could fantasize the girl and guy in the book.  The writer knows what women want.  And of course they get pregnant and he is a great father and they have nannies to take the child away whenever they want to have sex.  So of course they are never tired or stressed out.  This was better than a fairy tale because it went past the prince and princess going off to the castle to live happily ever after.  It showed the first year in the castle and it was great too.
0060775858|5.0|i like that the book is brightly colored.  and that i can point to a picture associated with every word \\"comb\\", \\"brush\\", \\"house\\", \\"moon\\", \\"over the moon\\", etc.  we have found a new purpose for this book at every age level since we got it (to establish a bedtime routine, to learn new words, to learn new primary colors), we've had it since our son was 6 mths old, he is now 18 mths old.

0761119752|4.0|Since my toddler enjoys the \\"Philadelphia Chickens\\" CD by Boynton, I thought this book would be a good match since one of the songs is \\"Pajama Time!\\"  Boy, were we wrong.  The illustrations are classic Boynton, true, but it somehow lacks the charm of the recorded song.  Not sure what it is, but even my book-loving toddler can't sit still for this one, and quickly loses interest (she usually will sit for a story from cover to cover).  Together, we say \\"meh\\" to this one.<br /><br />Update, April 2013:  At 2 years old now,this book has suddenly become a favorite before naptime, and during potty time.  Maybe she can relate to the lyrics a little better now?  I still think that the recorded song is a little better than the book, but she likes to read it now, and will sit on the potty to do her business while \\"reading\\" this.  She has also discovered the fun of the cutout cover and will play peek-a-boo with it before naptime/potty time.  I'm just giving it 4 stars because all the lyrics from the recorded song are not in this book, and if you attempt to sing it, you will need to modify some of the verses, but the gist of the song is there.
B000002L9Y|4.0|While not as widely heralded as the band's always lauded \\"Rumours,\\" \\"Tango In The Night\\" could easily be the best of their post \\"Rumours\\" efforts. This was the last album recorded by the Christine/John McVie, Stevie Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham and Mick Fleetwood Lineup (Buckingham split afterwards), The album peaked at number 7 and dropped two top ten singles in the twisted \\"Big Love\\" and \\"Little Lies,\\" with \\"Seven Wonders\\" and \\"Everywhere\\" being substantial hits.<br /><br />Starting off life as a Buckingham solo album, \\"Tango\\" morphed into a Fleetwood Mac group disc. Produced by Buckingham and longtime cohort Richard Dashut, he brought his edginess to a great portion of the disc, from the push and pull of \\"Big Love\\" to the quirky \\"Family Man.\\" Nicks revisits her love songs to strong women theme with \\"Welcome to The Room (Sara)\\" and Christine McVie scored with the lovely \\"Everywhere.\\" Mick gets to do more with his drums that usual, like the middle eastern vibe of \\"Caroline,\\" and the title song. Buckingham is still in charge, though, his signature vocals are dominant throughout.<br /><br />Even with that, this still sounds like a group effort thanks to the contributions from McVie and Nicks. It allows Buckingham to exit on a solid plain, while the rest of the band have offered him a gratifying curtain call. Still one of their best efforts. (Given the collapse that followed, that's worth repeating. \\"Behind The Mask\\" peaked at 33 and had one top 40 single, \\"Time\\" failed to even hot the top 100.)

The box is in excellent shape, the movie runs perfectly, and I just love it all! Well worth it's money and got it SO quick too! It was a present for my 4 year old neice and  she just LOVED it! Thank you! You made me the most awesome aunt ever!

The bass will DROP HARD during any type of song your into it. I mainly listen to Dubstep and these things SATISFY TO THE EXTREME.<br /><br />Not to mention how when talking on Skype friends tell me it sounds like I'm using a Studio Microphone it's quite amazing.<br /><br />$70, worth it.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This book has several plot points. You begin the book in the middle of a trial where Mikael Blomkvist is being charged with liable for printing a false magazine article about a big financial tycoon. Then it moves on to a old man from the Vanger family who is trying to solve the disappearance of his granddaughter. The Old man hires Lisbeth Salander the Girl (whom is actually a 20 year old woman) with a dragon tattoo to do a background check on the man who is being sued. Mikael then in turn is hired to find the missing granddaughter. During, the process of his investigation he finds out about the background check and hires the woman with the dragon tattoo to help him. This book reads like a magazine. The different plots and character's life stories are intertwined though out the book. I fond myself thinking that at the end of a chapter it should say to continue this story turn to page 20. It isn't until all of the characters are introduced that this book really gets going and is a very intense crime drama that makes your blood race and you find that deep down this book is about the hidden abuse of money and women. Would, I recommend this book? Well, that would depend on the person reading it. If you like to read magazines and you are not the kind of reader who stops reading a book, if you don't like the first chapter then you will like this book. I think that the middle of this book is well wroth reading the rest.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|You should definitely watch this movie if you love Sushi or consider yourself a \\"foodie\\". However, I think to call this simply a \\"great movie about Sushi\\" belittles it.  Rather, it is a documentary about someone who genuinely loves his chosen career, and strives for perfection on a daily basis. Jiro, a 3-star Michelin Sushi Chef in Tokyo, has been honing his skills for over 70 years in chosen craft.  Jiro states in the very beginning of the movie that \\"Once you decide on your occupation...you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That's the secret of success... and is the key to being regarded honorably.\\"  In a world where very culinary student expects to be the next Iron Chef as soon as they graduate, this outlook is not only rare, it is refreshing.  And yes, the food scenes are utterly mesmerizing.  He is like an artist, or a maestro.  The classical music that plays while he serves his customers underlines this fact.  You are allowed access to a true master, in every sense of the word.  But the film also makes it clear that often, one must make sacrifices in order to fully immerse yourself in your work.  Even though both of his sons trained under him, and one of them still works for him, Jiro makes it clear that he often sacrificed his family for his career. His oldest son, Yoshikazu, is 50 years old and still works for his father.  There is an interesting father-son dynamic that runs throughout the film.  Will the son be able to replace the father? Will his \\"product\\" be considered inferior in comparison?  There is a lot of pressure placed upon his shoulders.  Yet, as Yoshikazu states, it seems the legacy Jiro will leave behind is: \\"Always look ahead and above yourself. Always try to improve on yourself. Always strive to elevate your craft. That's what he taught me.\\"  It is a wonderful film that will not only leave you hankering for Sushi, but will make you think about your own beliefs about work, life, and family.will make you think about your own beliefs about work, life, and family.
030758836X|2.0|If you want to read a book about totally unlikeable characters doing improbable things and taking a really long time to do them, this is the book for you.The writer is skilled at getting the reader into the characters' heads which only serves to make the book more annoying. Her commentary on the media as the courtroom and the public as the jury was interesting. Otherwise, I do not understand the enthusiasm for this book.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Loved this series...<br />Not just about the Sex. There is a story line here and true to life in many relationships. So hoping for Book number 4. Feel like I know the characters in depth:)
B007SGM084|5.0|I had many friends and coworkers read this book and that's how I found out about it so I caved in and got this. Omg did the first book take me by surprise!It's the most exciting romantic drama-esque fiction I've ever read. I'd recommend it to anyone who'd want to try something different.
B005JFWKKY|2.0|I bought one of these. And went for it mainly for the Sony logo. It's a nice protector and still allows for the screw to fold flat. What I don't like is the fact that dust can get under the protecter. It has a tiny air gap that isn't sealed all the way around. There are 2 areas at the bottom that allows dust to accumulate in the cover.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|Unstoppable - Review of the final Tony Scott Film<br /><br />To put it bluntly, if Unstoppable were filmed by any other director the result would have been abysmal. Tony Scott draws upon his 20 plus years of directing to take this project to the big screen. His demanding requirements of what goes into his films, his use of camera angles and wide angle shots, the lack of any unnecessary CGI to give the viewer that sense of up close realism that has been absent in most films since the late 90's, make Unstoppable a movie to enjoy, not debate who's going to get the Oscar for this or that.<br /><br />No one's winning any races or defending the friendly skies over the Atlantic, you're not going to hear bullets whizzing past you or someone yelling from the submarine command center \\"Dive! Dive! Dive!\\" . You won't find any catchy one-liners either. The action is more controlled, centered, human. It's a reality movie but with all the appeal of a big budget action movie.<br /><br />The villain isn't a corrupt Big Brother watching from above in high definition, the villain isn't even a person, it's an unstoppable force with a mind of its own: a multi million pound train. Unstoppable is a true roller coaster ride all the way. It has character from Denzel Washington giving his 5th and final appearance in Scott's film legacy since 1995's Crimson Tide and Chris Pine teaming up with a very believable performance. They're the heroes of Unstoppable as they're top billed, but they're not supermen. They don't perform any miracle maneuvers in mid air while emptying two clips and reloading before hitting the ground. They're saving the day by doing what their characters were meant to do: their jobs. The film is based on real events and it's not going to bend reality so much as to have your head in a knot. You understand the characters, you can relate, you know their weaknesses and they're played against them to overcome not just the main obstacle but their own evils.<br /><br />Unstoppableis a film that shows you everyday people going beyond their required duty to save the day. One of the best parts in the film is when they're told not to do anything and even threatened to be fired if they don't stop what they're doing. The antagonistic CEO asks him why he would risk his life when he's three weeks from retirement and it doesn't really hit you what this movie was about until then.<br /><br />Forget about someone doing the impossible and nick of the moment acrobatics that get most movie goers raving and drooling for endless action and violence that is prevalent in most movies, this feature has none of it. It's about someone doing what they can because they were never asked to and because they know they must. Unstoppable was believable. Tony Scott gave us a final film from the heart, not something that will go down as the highest grossing blockbuster of all time, but as a true character piece, a visually captive approach to filmmaking and an inspiration to anyone out there who wonders what true heroes are.<br /><br />They're not men of steel and dressed in capes, they're the ones who never give a thought to their own safety before diving in head first and ensuring someone else's and they could just as likely be you or me. And when they finally save the day you feel great, emotional, enriched with appreciation for these average Joes that remind us of Uncle Jack that used to work for Union Pacific for 25 years or maybe that friend of Steve who went out of his way that time back in '89 and saved some folks from harm. It gets you right in the heart and sticks.<br /><br />Unstoppable is the last of Tony Scott's films and it rests comfortably at the end of his credits. He mentions in the special features that he's really making the same movie over and over each time, each time a little different but in a lot of ways they're the same, crafted from the same piece of clay or block of ice. I think I know what he means. He left his heart and soul in them and if you want to know what Tony Scott was all about, just give one of his films a try.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />So we're left with a mystery as to why he took his life and it's likely that we'll never know the reason. I only hope he was satisfied with his work because I know I really enjoyed his movies over the years. I remember Top Gun and Days of Thunder the most. What I think I like the most about his films is how many times I can re-watch them and enjoy them the same each time. A lot of his films are that way. They had it all. He didn't make spectacular movies, he made great movies. The ones you can just watch for fun.<br /><br />\\"Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a flyby. Negative, Ghost Rider, the pattern is full.\\"
B0084IG7KC|1.0|I pity this generation of movie goers that think this movie and Twilight Saga are engaging and emotionally charged.<br /><br />Flat. Dull. Unengaging. Bland. Simplistic. Unintelligent.

B007LNJ4YW|5.0|I stumbled upon Beach House's Teen Dream a few years ago and after a few listens fell in love with their sound. As others on here mention, this album is a great accompaniment to the former. There sound is solid...and they just keep improving. The use of live drums on this album is one such improvement that adds to their sound.<br /><br />In short, if you enjoyed Teen Dream, this purchase is a \\"no-brainer\\"<br /><br />Why aren't radio stations in Cleveland, Ohio playing this stuff?! (ClearChannel, grrr)

0792164903|4.0|Sleepy Hollow is a very good Tim Burton film with very powerful preformances from Deep and Ricci.  I gave the movie 4 stars because I enjoy the actual movie but it drags a little bit between the good parts.  But what won it for me was the fact Burton got Chris Walken to do the headless horseman role.  To me he is a very talented actor, I hope Tim Burton and Deep do many more roles together. So if you like some horror mixed with few comedical lines then pick this movie up and see a new version and twist on the legend of Sleepy Hollow.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the ability to listen to the Bible as elk as read it.  It is easy to use.<br />I recommend it.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Sweeney Todd was a very good musical and drama mixed together to make an amazing movie by Burton, Deep, and Carter.  If you truly love your horror movies and Burton films then you will love what he came up with idea wise of taking a boardway musical and turning it into a motion picture.  I listen and watch the movie with an open mind and ear and even enjoyed each moment of the movie thanks to the great acting of all the actors in it.  I hope Burton makes movies for a very long time to come.

030758836X|1.0|The first 2/3 of this book was fantastic, worthy of all the media praise it has received. But then... the last 1/3 of the book completely falls apart. The characters, even the secondary ones, become more than flawed-- they are either utterly despicable (Amy, Nick) or pathetic cliches (Mo: \\"I'll love you no matter what\\" and even worse, Tanner Bolt).<br /><br />The ending? *Sigh* Just. Awful.

I had to go back and tell people not to bother because the ending ruined the whole thing for me!

B003VANOFY|5.0|I needed a headset that could make the 8 hour workday. The battery on these is great (as long as I charge it at night :). I have a Mac and everything works great without needing to set them up. The Pseudo Surround doesn't work on a mac but sounds good to me, but I'm not an audiophile. I love the moveable mic that mutes it plus a dedicated mute button on the side as well. The build quality is very solid. The only potential downside is that the power button is a little annoying to turn on and off, but definitely not a deal breaker. Everyone at work seems to really like how I sound so the microphone is pretty good, plus you can adjust the mic position itself up, down and in and out, so it will fit any face.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I completely agree with Robgman's review. I don't understand why people have to make such criticizing remarks to someone who has done so much in music over the years for us all to enjoy. Paul in my book, is a legend! Wow!!! What can I say! I got the deluxe version of this fantastic album at a record shop in Sri Lanka and it is out of this world! Paul really has a unique way of singing these old standards. Beautiful!!! This is something unusual for Paul's fans. I have loved the Beatles and Paul since the age of 6. I will be 28 next month the 16th. Another reviewer said Paul should make a heavy metal and rap album. I hope not!!! My only hope is for him to do a country music album as country music is my number 1 love. Rod Stewart certainly is making so many great albums of standards. Cliff Richard did the same thing, Tom Jones did the same thing, Willie Nelson did it, and now Paul did this CD. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the old jazz and pop standards! This is not everyone's cup of tea I know, but I think it is superb! At times, Paul's voice gets a little gravely, but he's 70 now and that's to be expected. Enjoy!

B0041OT9W6|5.0|I am disappointed in the one-star and two-star reviews of this book.  Anne Frank was a teenager - how many teens do you know that can write this fluently?  I have a sixteen and a fourteen year old - neither of them could write like this.  What people do not realize is that Anne could not comment on the Holocaust as a witness because she was locked up in a small space with seven other people - and she was the youngest.  Her diary is \\"boring\\" because her life was boring!  She comments on the war and the people to the best of her ability - because she knows only what she hears on the radio or her contacts tell her.  Did anyone read (and feel pain) of her dreams?  The ones where she saw her friends being taken to extermination camps?<br /><br />I am re-reading this book to remind myself, as I am going to Amsterdam next week and plan on spending time at the building where Anne and her family and friends lived for over two years.<br /><br />Those who complained about the \\"boring\\" book - YOU try living in a cramped space with many people and not be allowed to do anything - YOU try to write a diary that is as full of love of life as Anne did!<br /><br />The Kindle edition that I have is of very good quality.  I am enjoying it very much - as much as you can enjoy a book such as this.

0393061310|1.0|I assume it was page 10 as I have the Kindle version.  Let me explain, I have a habit of putting down a book when the author makes egregious errors in thought or reasons and as this happened so early in the book I felt I had better ways to spend my time as it could only portend worse errors to come and a waste of my time.<br /><br />Diamond begins well by explaining why he became interested in the subject after spending time in New Guinea and was asked by a prominent local politician why the Westerners were so technologically advanced while they were not.  Diamond goes to great effort to explain that intelligence cannot explain the reason why there was such great disparity among civilizations and the advance of technology.  First of all intelligence is very difficult to measure as the IQ test is more of a measure of cultural intelligence and innate intelligence(his words: (whatever that is)) cannot be measured by them.  I agree with this.<br /><br />At this point, it goes downhill very fast.  He goes on to explain the New Guineans are SMARTER than Westerners.  This is just after him saying intelligence is too difficult to accurately measure and he does not explain his criteria for this only we must take his word on it.  He has an anecdote of visiting the jungle and feeling like an idiot for not being able to erect a shelter, which would be second nature to them.  Well I don't know, I can solve a second order differential equation but can't pitch a tent in the jungle.  Which takes more intelligence?  The answer is it's a meaningless question as pitching a tent in the jungle is just as useless to me as is solving abstract mathematical equations is to them.  Diamond seemed to understand this in the first few pages and then loses sight of it quickly.  His explanation for why the New Guineans are smarter than us is selective evolutionary pressures for intelligence over the recent past while any old idiot can reproduce in the West.  Oh and we watch too much television.  I'm not making this up, this is what he says.<br /><br />It seems that Diamond is trying so hard to be politically correct and sensitive he is falling into the white-guilt mode.  I agree with his overall premise at this point that intelligence has nothing to do with these differences, but science suffers greatly when it becomes politicized.  Perhaps I'm missing some gems in this book by quitting early, but I think I'll pick up another Steven Pinker book and know I'm not wasting my time.'m not making this up, this is what he says.<br /><br />It seems that Diamond is trying so hard to be politically correct and sensitive he is falling into the white-guilt mode.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|I have watched Avatar three times now - the first time the 3D version in the theaters, the second and third times the extended collectors 2D version on this three-disc set.<br /><br />To paraphrase Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap, I have concluded that this movie really goes to 11.<br /><br />In my opinion it may be the greatest science fiction movie of all time, surpassing even 2001, Blade Runner, and Star Wars.<br /><br />Avatar is stunning to look at and listen to, it is moving and exciting, and it carries an unmistakable message about the sins of imperialism.<br /><br />I also disagree with those who think that the script is wanting. Though there are no memorable quotes here as in Casablanca, the story points are well-thought-out and the script conveys a world of exposition in a very efficient and economical manner.<br /><br />The acting is also very fine, both of the humans and the Na'vi, with a special nod to Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Giovanni Ribisi as the requisite corporate scumbag.<br /><br />Finally I must also commend the remarkable score by James Horner. In my opinion the African-inspired music here equals or surpasses anything composed by John Williams or Bernard Herrmann and adds greatly to the movie's impact.<br /><br />What can I say? This is a science fiction film for the ages, and there are a good number of compelling reasons why Avatar has become the highest grossing film in history.<br /><br />For those who lack 3-D televisions and Blu-ray players, this three-DVD collectors edition set is the way to go, with a disk of extra features on the making of the film.<br /><br />I just wonder how James Cameron can top this film in the sequels to come.

0375507256|5.0|Just finished reading - or rather devouring - Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas consists of 6  interlinking stories, told from the viewpoint of 6 different individuals at 6 different points in time.<br /><br />The first story consists of the letters of Adam Ewing, during a fateful trip on a ship in the Pacific in the mid 1850's. (think \\"Master and Commander\\")<br /><br />From there we go to the second story, which takes place in the 1930's and is told from the viewpoint of Robert Frobisher, a talented disinherited muscial composer who visits wealthy maestro and his family in an attempt to get work and advantage. His story is told through his letters to a scientist friend/lover named Rufus Sixsmith. (Think \\"Downton Abbey\\")<br /><br />The next story takes place in the 1970's, and has to do with reporter Luisa Rey, and her exposure of corporate malfeasance that could result in disaster. Sixsmith is a scientist there, and plays an important part of the story. (Think any spy thriller you have every enjoyed)<br /><br />Next, is the story of Timothy Cavendish, in present day England, and the tale of his (mis) adventures as a book publisher. Utterly hilarious and poignant. (Think Monty Python)<br /><br />The second to last story becomes a sci/fi read of future corporate controlled Korea, complete with cloned humans. (Think \\"Brave New World\\")<br /><br /> And the final story is one that takes place in post apocalyptic Hawaii. (Think \\"Myst\\" - the early computer game)<br /><br />And then we go back to each story, in opposite order, and put the pieces together and complete the cliffhanger endings from the first half. (Think - I have never read anything like this before in my life)<br /><br />It is at times a challenging read, in the sense that each story is told in a completely different style from the others. As soon as you become comfortable with a story, it ends and you have to adjust to a different voice. But it is fantastically rewarding. From a writing standpoint - a complete tour de force.
B00000G3I2|3.0|The movie is one of my all-time favorites, but this 15th anniversary DVD is one of the worst I have ever dealt with.<br /><br />After 3 attempts to turn off the subtitles, it still insisted on putting them back on. I had to restart the stupid thing THREE times to get it to work right. I should never have to tell any DVD more than once that I want them off. Ever. I should never have to tell it at all to do this. It just about made me want to throw the thing against the wall and break it.<br /><br />Why do these companies insist on forcing us to turn off the subtitles when 99.999% of us don't use them? They should assume that we don't want it and stop hacking us off by automatically setting it to take them. Just like anything else, if we want it, we'll ask for it.<br /><br />Also, when they \\"update\\" these movies, they need to stop taking away the original versions of the DVDs so we're not forced to pay for a lousy version that doesn't work right or with so many useless scenes that it ruins the original story.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've always been a fan of dystopian literature, but I'd gotten out of the sci-fi habit over the last few years.  On a whim, I checked out The Hunger Games for a quick read, and then found myself a bit stuck in the setting, (a book hangover, if you will), with a strong female protagonist and a solid dystopian world. Someone recommended the Wool Omnibus to me, and I snatched it up because of the low Kindle price.  I was totally satisfied.  This is a fully fleshed out series, taken all together, and I found myself absolutely invested in the Silo.<br /><br />If anyone is on the fence because of the self-published nature of the stories, I can say confidently, \\"go for it!\\" This is a cut above plenty of the (enjoyable) trash that you can find in bookstores, and is in itself (especially Wool 2-5) perfectly comparable with plenty of works that are considered genre classics. You won't be disappointed in the quality of Wool.

0142407542|5.0|The Gruffalo's Child is a cute story that moves quickly and will have you and your child giggling at the antics of the Gruffalo's Child.<br /><br />She is told by her father that she should be very wary of \\"The Big Bad Mouse\\" which is a direct reference to the mouse in the original Gruffalo. As most kids do...she has to test the waters to see exactly what there is to be afraid of.<br /><br />During her journey she comes across a few mean animals that wish her more harm then good. She meets a snake, an owl and a few others. Just as you are starting to feel sorry for the poor little Gruffalo she stumbles across the mouse and goes from a Gruffalo you feel sorry for to the meanie she is...she wants to EAT THE MOUSE!! She grabs him by the tail and is ready to devour when the quick thinking mouse turns the tables on her and becomes \\"The Big Bad Mouse\\"!<br /><br />A very cute movie that your children will enjoy.

B000W93CHC|3.0|Sometimes the glimpse of the inevitability of certain events stare at us...can the end of the exiting and grandiose story telling of Ken Follet...be foreseen?...can his Pillars of the Earth simply be repeated?...Fall of Giants as well as World Without End emphasize the difference between a brilliant, moving and enormous 'piece de resistance'...and his latter -and most recent- excellent work...i wish so much to be wrong...and hope he will throw in my face...another classic...and i promise to write that i stand corrected...and that i enjoyed it every bit as much as P.of T. E. ...and that to many readers... including this barbarian...it will also stand among the one thousand favourite books of all time...thus, i will pursue to read every book he writes, and enjoy everyone of them, in the search of that one more classic that surely is embedded in him...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say that I love these books! Yeah I feel like sometimes it can be repetitive in some of the scenes but I think that it was written to put you in the mood of the scenes.  The story behind the lusty parts is what got my attention even more then the love scenes itself. I didn't want the story to end. I think that the author did a great job on writing these books and would read more that are written. I believe that either you are into these kind of stories or your not. If your not a love/romance reader then don't bother wasting your time, if you are though then your in for a great book! Its a love story that i believe we all could find wonderful if it were to happen to us in real life! Good job!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is the biggest piece of spam I've ever read. The story line is weak, it is predictable and extremely boring.
B007SGM084|4.0|I read so many mixed reviews I was really hesitant to purchase it, but once I did, I enjoyed the trilogy.  It's true what they say about hundreds of repeated \\"holy s@&$\\" and other phrases that become annoying.  But I have to say I enjoyed it overall.  There's an actual story which I found intriguing.  Really happy to find that Anastasia was a strong woman, but also learned and grew throughout.  I got beyond the redundant phrases and enjoyed the story.
0345803485|5.0|I'm excited that Amazon shipped this book so quickly and had such a good price on it. I read it in a few days and I feel like I'm finally in the loop on This risque subject!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The characters are not only well developed but they are brand new - nothing recycled here.  The complexities of Amy's personality, the layers of detail, planning and deviousness that were required for her to execute her master plan were fascinating and surprising at every turn, the prose was clear, the language was entertaining and novel. But what struck me most was the dialogue, which was fresh, natural, and rang completely true, a rare find in my reading anyway.  I'm sorry Gillian Flynn is a relatively new author because I know I'm going to go through everything she's written and be left hungry for more.  Perfect book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is so useful.  It lets me know how much time is left for different activities.  Now there's no question whether it needs to charge or not!
B004LWZW7E|1.0|When I first heard about this movie concept I thought, \\" How original, must be worth the time.\\" If anything it was a misuse of time. The movie had a good story idea, \\"the need for people to buy time\\" because that is what most human beings wish, more time for accomplishments, more time for change, more time to spend with our loved ones, more time for that stressful test and so forth. Unfortunately the movie failed to execute. I had expected to feel desperation in the action, the movie should have been 90 minutes at most. Instead I was desperate for it to be over and was even at the verge of turning it off, which is in itself a bad sign.<br /><br />What frustrates me the most about this movie is that it could have been great. If you are a person that highly values time I don't recommend you watch this movie, however this movie does serve as a good example of what happens when a potentially good story lacks the necessary components to deliver and I encourage people that would like to study film to watch this movie because you will learn a lot on \\"how not to do it.\\"
0757302661|3.0|I went into this with an open mind, and there were a lot of things I agreed with in the early parts of the book. I can see how a lot of this would be useful to all women, however the author lost me with one glaring contradiction - she says early on in the book that birth is not painful if the mother is relaxed and that only fear causes pain, yet later in the book there are many techniques to hypnotize yourself to not feel pain, including how to distribute a sense of numbness to chosen places of your body. Uh, if it's not painful, why do we need to spent so much time learning how to distance our minds from the pain?<br /><br />This technique is also a lot of work. I don't doubt that for women willing to put the time and effort in it would be effective, but for me personally it's excessive.<br /><br />There's also a lot of unnecessary fluff, for example, I don't believe that down-to-earth educated women need a separate birth language that is less frightening.
0385523912|5.0|Earlier this year, I read Guy DeLisle's Pyongyang and didn't really enjoy it because DeLisle came off as an angry and frustrated tour guide to take us through the country.  Almost everyone in the comments of that post mentioned Demick's book, and so when I saw it on my visit to Powell's Books in Portland, OR, I didn't think twice about getting it.<br /><br />And while I still think that DeLisle was harsh in his assessment of the North Korean people, I can understand now where his frustration and anger stem from, especially when you learn about the number of North Koreans that have died of starvation over the past decade or two.<br /><br />Barbara Demick worked in Seoul for the LA Times as a reporter and while she was there, she interviewed many North Korean defectors.  What she learned was truly chilling and sad.<br /><br />In some ways, you almost want to laugh at the things you hear about North Korea and their almost cultish way of life.  The belief that the Grand Marshall Kim Il-sung was born under an auspicious double rainbow near a sacred mountain when almost everyone knows that he was born somewhere completely different.  That when he died, a thousand birds descended to take his body straight to heaven.  That he led fantastically successful military maneuvers against enemies and won every battle against overwhelming odds.  That he is an agricultural/astrophysics/military/operations/government genius.  It's ludicrous on so many levels, and perhaps it would be funny if the North Koreans had a way to prove him wrong, to understand that there are other sides to the story, other opinions.  But they don't.  And so anyone who doesn't quite fit in, who doesn't believe heart and soul in the Communist regime, feels completely isolated and terrified of being turned in.  And they so often are.  North Korea has work camps and spies and police and military enough to make anyone think twice about rising up against those in power.<br /><br />Demick presents all of these factsin her book, but unlike DeLisle, she has obvious sympathy for the people whose stories she shares.  And the people are wonderful, too.  We meet people who were born defiant and never fit into the North Korean way of life.  We meet people who fully bought into Kim Il-sung's doctrines until their own lives fell completely apart.  And their stories are so moving and so personal that it's impossible not to become deeply absorbed in this book.  Demick shows us a population of highly inventive, determined people who want to live their best life.  They are downtrodden, hungry, and disillusioned, but they also bounce back from so many setbacks.  Reading their stories here really humanizes North Koreans and makes it clear that, just like the rest of the world, they have individual hopes and dreams that they want to accomplish, too.  A beautiful book with a lot of heart.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I decided to read this novel after two people whose opinions I trust recommended it. At first, I didn't know why. I read through Part One with a \\"meh\\" frame of mind, then I hit Part Two and was hooked. It was if a switch got flipped, ramping up the stakes, and the interest level. The characters are not particularly likable, it is true -- though I did begin to sympathize with Nick's trapped state. And I didn't feel the ending was a let down. I thought it ended on just the right note of \\"leaving them wanting more.\\" I will probably find myself speculating on what comes next in odd moments for a long time to come. All I know is that I just bought her previous two books, and that is the best tribute a writer can aspire to. :)

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I don't usually read trilogies!  I normally read only well written books.  It had sold so many copies, well I thought I will give it a go.  The tag 'soft-porn' was being bandied around.  From Page 1 I really got into this book and could not put it down - a real escape from a busy hectic life.  It is a love story with a difference, I grant you that but, I truly found it un-put-downable!  The sex is played out too often and at times I found the Dominant and Submissive roles a little too much but then you read about this stuff and at last it is explained to the uninitiated.  They lead exceedingly glamorous lives and it's  great to get away from austerity and recessionary measures and into an unreal world.  The clothes, the aromas, the cars,the music, the food - the whole enchillada - I loved it.  Was it well written - not especially but whatever recipe the author has used,let me tell you it is successful.  Don't let people put you off - read it.  Take it on holidays.  Download it on your Kindle if you don't want anyone to know what you are reading, but honestly it is the great escape.  The story line is a little far-fetched but we want to escape at times and this is one way to get on that route!!!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What can be said that hasnt already been said? The script, fx and acting were simply outstanding. Joss Whedon has done what, I believe, only he could do and thats treat these iconic characters with the respect they deserve. We all have our favorite characters but Joss did not play favorites, allowing every one their share of on screen time. I must say he gets props for finally getting The Hulk right. The past Hulk films concentrated on showing Hulk as a monster and this one shows him as a hero. Overall it was pitch perfect. \\"Nuff said\\"

B00003CXCD|5.0|Audrey Hepburn won an Academy Award for her first performance in a major Hollywood studio film production. She was known outside of Hollywood before she came to play the Princess in this romantic comedy (perhaps a classic of all time). In this film, she is paired with Gregory Peck (who insisted that Audrey Hepburn get her name above the film title). Cary Grant passed on the film role because he knew the Princess would get all of the attention but he was wrong. Peck did a fabulous job in his role as an American journalist who befriends the Princess during their Roman holiday.<br /><br />Hepburn's performance is enchanting and believable. Edith Head didn't get to meet Hepburn before film production since it was filmed abroad. Head used the screen test and Hepburn's measurements to design clothes for her. Audrey Hepburn performs beautifully and elegantly like a princess looking for fun from her boring meetings, meals, and dances with European dignitaries. She sneaks out and looks for adventure in Rome.<br /><br />Gregory Peck's performance is equally enchanting as the American journalist who befriends and keeps her company on her Roman holiday. You have to wonder if he's going to rat her out and use her for a story. Peck's comedic charm comes through in this picture. Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn make a lovely pair in this picture.<br /><br />Eddie Albert played the photographer and supporting player who helps keep the secret. He is also unrecognizable in this performance with a beard. You can't help but have to rematch for him. The scene at the Mouth was done with one take.<br /><br />If you watch the extra special features, Gregory Peck explains how it went. There is also a short on the making of Roman Holiday with bits from Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn; Catherine Wyler; Eddie Albert; and Edward Allbert. The film was William Wyler's first comedy in decades and one of the first films shot entirely on location in Rome. Paramount would have casted Dame Elizabeth Taylor or Jean Simmons OBE but both were unavailable. That's who the world got to know and love Audrey Hepburn, a beautiful woman inside and out. Nobody has ever said anything negative about her. The same can be said about Gregory Peck, a beloved Hollywood actor. The screenplay was done by blacklisted author Dalton Trumbo and that's another story.<br /><br />Besides the making of \\"Roman Holiday,\\" there is restoration explanation of the film itself. While this feature is a little stale at times, it's interesting to see the comparisons between the past and present.<br /><br />Another extra special feature is a tribute to Edith Head, the costume designer to the stars like Hepburn, Taylor, and so many others. Edith Head designed clothes for women to help emphasize their features. She was quite a Hollywood character in her own right, an original, and a legendary film icon.

0374203032|5.0|This book is not for scholars.  Too anecdotal, too many casual examples of the human comedy.  This book is for the common guy, such as myself.  Book contains many examples of human folly and our obsessive veneration of economic markets.  I had no idea ordinary Americans can legally make huge wagers on when some stranger will die.  We have an insurance industry gone wild.  But why not bet death, we bet on most everything else.  Look at the derivative mess on Wall Street.  Not an economics book, certainly not a finance book, this is a easy to read pop philosophy book that the casual reader will enjoy.

0385512058|4.0|I used to kid about this book, saying that once I read the title that I didn't need to read the book.  I found it on sale one day and took the plunge.  Turns out the book has a solid set of ideas for networkers, even experienced ones.  This is the kind of book that is worth going back through once a year to remind me what I ought to be doing for myself and my business.  The only down side to the book is that occasionally the author just can't help himself on what even he would admit is a bit of \\"shameless self-promotion\\".  On the whole, a book that I now recommend to others.
B006O5YI7G|4.0|This is not a typical shoot 'em up fast action style western. Nor is it a historically accurate western. It's a 'what if' story about a western character, Butch Cassidy (Robert Parker).<br />The cinematography is wonderful. Shot in Bolivia and you can certainly tell that.<br />Sam Shephard's acting is great and I think the acting of the mining engineer is also very good.<br />I'm usually good at predicting the ends of most movies. This one I was still able to predict, but only because of a reaction by one of the posse. Many people might have missed that & would indeed be surprised at the ending.<br />I thought it was a good plot.<br />I purchased the DVD & am glad I did.<br />It's a movie I could enjoy again.<br />I think you'll be pleased if you enjoy westerns.
0425263908|5.0|I bought this on a whim and was curious due to all the positive reviews. There were a lot of similarities in the storyline between this and 50 Shades but all in all an enjoyable book. I actually liked Eva better than I did Anatasia in 50 Shades. She is stronger and more together it seems. I really enjoyed the supporting characters like Cary, Mark and his partner, etc. I am very much looking forward to the sequel to figure out what happens to everyone. There are a lot more stories that could be told with this series!
0307730697|5.0|Stop trying to decide whether to read this book or not.  This is the one.  Buy it and read it.  Amazing and inspirational story of the life and ultimate sacrifice of a real hero.  Best book I've read in recent memory.
0156030209|5.0|I was blown completely away by this book. It's one of the best books I've read. One of the most impressive things about it is Yann Martel actually got me to believe this could happen, that a teenage boy could actually survive months adrift at sea with a Bengal tiger. That in itself is an incredible feat. And the ending was like being clobbered over the head (in a good way). That kind of deception (or was it?) is hard to pull off, and Yann Martel did it with mathematical precision. If you liked the ending, you might want to try Robert Cormier's [[ASIN:0375840397 I Am the Cheese]] which has a similar affect.
9500426404|5.0|This is my favorite book, i recommend that every single person would read this book, it would leave you a positive message and you'll have a better understanding of things.
0307352145|4.0|Quiet is full of insights that result from scientific, psychological studies.  I was especially interested in the concept of reactivity.  However, I would have liked see the author talk directly, as it were, to the introverted readers and give examples of how to function better in an extroverted world.  Perhaps that could be the author's follow up to Quiet?  Either way, this is a must read for those whose extro- or introversion has an impact on their daily lives.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|The fact that Dark Roots of Earth got me to set aside Kreator's [[ASIN:B0088RUM50 Phantom Antichrist]] may be the best compliment I can give it.  In a year of fantastic thrash metal releases, Testament's latest album can stand among the best.  The classic Bay area band has brought us a brand new album with nine killer new tracks, each and every one a winner.<br /><br />Dark Roots of Earth largely eschews the death metal trappings of Testament's previous outing, The Formation of Damnation, in favor of undiluted thrash metal.  They may still be a little lower and slower than a band such as, say, Megadeth, but the focus here is still more on melody and speed than heavy, downtuned riffing.  Still, a little survives, such as the occasional (welcome) blast beat, and Chuck Billy's deep growl on tracks like \\"Real American Hate\\".<br /><br />Production is top-notch, and while that may not be to everyone's taste, it suits this album well.  The bass is prominent, and shines as it drives along slower tracks like \\"A Day in the Death\\" and the title track.  Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson deliver some excellent solos throughout, which make the whole album something special.  Chuck Billy puts forth excellent vocals as always, particularly on the chorus of \\"Man Kills Mankind\\", the best part of the entire song, and a high point of the album.  There is honestly no filler or weak points here.<br /><br />High points include the fast and instantly catchy opener \\"Rise Up\\", the title track, and the particularly thrashy songs \\"Day in the Death\\" and \\"Last Stand for Independence\\".  \\"Native Blood\\" is also an excellent single, and stands out as the best song on the album.  It manages to make more of its 5 ½ minute running time than many songs twice its length, with fantastic bass and drumming, and some killer soloing.  Even the ballad-like \\"Cold Embrace\\", although slower and comparatively softer, is worth a listen, blending lighter passages seamlessly with rough, plodding choruses.<br /><br />This is one of those great albums that has you constantly turning to a friend to say, \\"Here comes the best part\\".  And you'll do that over and over again.  This is one of, if not the absolute best thrash metal album of the year.<br /><br />A note on the special edition:  Four extra tracks are present here, along with a bonus DVD.  I haven't bothered watching it yet, but the extra tracks are well worth the money on their own.  The cover of Queen's \\"Dragon Attack\\" is great - it sounds like the band had a lot of fun recording this one.  The tracks \\"Animal Magnetism\\" and \\"Powerslave\\" are also decent, although the extended edition of \\"Throne of Thorns\\" seems almost exactly the same as the original.<br /><br />I strongly recommend paying the extra couple dollars on the special edition.his is one of those great albums that has you constantly turning to a friend to say, \\"Here comes the best part\\".

B0018O4YSQ|1.0|Terrible acting, lousy script, well that just about sums up Dark City, a retro-science fiction disaster that has a trite story line and characters so flat you could slide them under a door.  I have no idea why this film is popular with anyone.  Please don't waste your time with this poor attempt.
B000HWZ4CA|2.0|loved the portrayal of the close knit community that depended on each other for getting through the hard scrabble times of the challenging farming trade, life was tough but made one tougher.... people depended on their faith and pastor to remind them of the value of hard work and family values.... so wonder why the lowland land/horse,etc. sale was portrayed as deeply salicious, covert, and usurous???  what a 180, opposite side of the spectrum of neighborly love and respect is shown here and hopefully for mere simplistic hollywood effect... completely undermines the benefits of this type of upbringing and this was a local guy, was it an underhanded slight of jews???  and using the bible against ur deep objections to killing, I mean it is a commandment, and I hear that Muslims do not have to pay the Obamacare health tax as they are not permitted to gamble (Taitz vs Texas)... ok, off topic but what a piece of propaganda to create a HERO??!!! from his success at a human turkey shoot, gobble gobble bang boom... MOH!!!  wars of agression fueled by American profiteers are hard to sell so they get their aw shucks Cooper to sell the program, I am least familiar with the motivations and aspects of WWI, only know that American shipping lanes were impacted and hence the bottom line affected, not really the prevention of lost lives which btw exceeded FIFTEEN MILLION 100 yrs ago, great plan!, but recommend this for hell raising gents who need the nudge to settle, turkey shoots, Alvin's dedication to education, and most of all Walter Brennans performance, superb!!!<br /><br />May 11, 2013  wanted to add that I was very confused how the \\"give ceasar what is ceasar's...\\" quote has ANYTHING to do with one's decision to join the FRONT lines, maybe the signal core or office job to insure he does not destroy innocent life, of course killing folks to save lives is self defense but most educated (i.e. crack a freak'n book) know this is not the case typically for most wars... my final comment needs to commend Alvin York for his deepest intent to follow his heart and use his phenom skills to protect his friends, what a man!ent needs to commend Alvin York for his deepest intent to follow his heart and use his phenom skills to protect his friends, what a man!
0393088774|4.0|I agree nearly 100% with the author's diagnosis and prognosis that fiscal stimulus to compensate for the drop of aggregate demand of the private sector is the only way left to bring the economy back to an acceptable, if not full employment level, after over 3 years of near zero short and mid term interest rates. Also, considering the US$15 Trillion US GDP and the current debt ratio which is far below that around WWII, Obama had done too little. However, despite the author's emphasis that economics should never be a morality play, the cases of Japan and PRC should give enough warning that ridculous wastage owing primarily to corruption of politicians and officials simply delay the menace, if not enlarge it. No matter what, I am obliged to say that I had learnt a lot from this book which is well written with intelligence, insight, style and wit. Recommended!<br /><br />p.s. I had been clumsy enough to check my Amazon review for the \\"Return of Depression Economics\\" written in August eleven years ago. Then, I was so impressed to write that \\"If you had not read this, dont tell others you had studied economics. That's no exaggeration. I really think Krugman deserves a Nobel prize. He is a brilliant story teller, using a lot of interesting parables .......A must read for any true economists and philosophers, who acknowledges one's ignorance and would like to learn from the humble and talented.\\" Honestly, now I am not so sure whether my comment on the author's character is still valid at all.

1419703692|5.0|This publication is very comprehensive reading for film novices and Batman fans. Despite what the few haters say, Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors today. His films are character driven and well thought out. If I was going to strive to make movies, he definitely would be one reference to imitate. Anyone that denies the fact he's a brilliant mind in the business is truly lost. And being a Batman fan from childhood to now, Nolan's Batman films are, to me, the best live action interpretations you'll see. They're unabashedly not silly. I also love how they aren't vulgar, graphically violent or raunchy. They're intelligent, exciting and engaging. I'm not here to make people that don't like these movies like them. Do you. But no one has an argument to me that they aren't as good as they are. Period. This publication breaks down nicely how Nolan and his crew approached these characters in a practical and respectable way. I further have been given an appreciation for this trilogy. I love how this book held nothing back. It spoke about every bit and piece of the hard work put into these films. The photos are plenty and well taken. The art gives insight too. Also, for those claiming Nolan ignores the comicbooks, this book proves otherwise. Those are haters just hating. These movies take many key things from the comics and graphic novels while making the movies still yet original. Not an easy task. This publication feels complete. I recommend any film or Batman fan to buy this.
0385360169|2.0|I can't understand the appeal of this book.  I picked it up after hearing all the hype about it and was thoroughly disappointed, or rather, annoyed.  James' quality of writing is absolutely abysmal.  She is unbelievably repetitive.  The book is page after page of cliches.  There is practically no character development and the characters themselves are boring and unrealistic.  I find it hard to believe that Ana Steele, a girl described as plain, clumsy, and introverted, would have hordes of men swooning over her, including a 27-year old billionaire (that right--not millionaire, but billionaire).  It is also incomprehensible how a 22-yr old girl with that many men interested in her could have no interest men, until she meets one who wants to whip, chain, and beat her.  This book may be mildy entertaining, but it is just not worth the brain cells you will lose reading it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the game. Of course they want you to spend real money to advance, but its not necessary. good

0425263908|5.0|Ah, I can't wait for the next one...<br /><br />I have to admit when I first started I couldn't get into it. The \\"dark and dangerous\\" comments made me want to hurl, but I \\"toughed\\" it out and I really enjoyed it. It was similar to \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" but I liked how Eva was stronger and more independant. I'm rooting for her and Gideon in the sequel.<br /><br />Hurry up Oct. 2nd!!!
B00466HN9K|5.0|This movie should be on blu ray, I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. Some of hitchcock's films are already out why can't this one be released on blu ray same wth The Birds? But I still enjoy the movie though.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Wow, this author really gets you to think you know these characters and then pulls the rug right out from under you! The author did a great job with how she told the story, I enjoyed the two perspectives, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I was really disappointed in the characters though, these people are crazy, or maybe I just don't like getting tricked by the author! I also wasn't happy with the ending, I wish it could have ended differently. Overall, I just don't feel like I can relax because how terrible the ending was, UGH!

042524489X|5.0|4.5 stars.<br /><br />Not quite a solid 5, I think I needed a little more Hawke/Sienna and a little less with the other characters to give it a 5 stars, but this was still very good.<br /><br />I had been reading another book (that I was loving and will go back to now) but Hawke & Sienna were calling out to me, loudly. I had to read their story.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow was un-put-down-able (don't think that's a word but it works) once I started I could not stop reading. Stayed up till 1 in the morning for a couple nights to read just a little bit more.<br /><br />Sienna was a great heroine and has become one of my favorites of the series. She has all this power but she is also so vulnerable in a few different ways. Hawke was amazing, to have such a strong male fall so hard for his chosen female is wonderful to read and experience.<br /><br />I can hardly wait to read the next one and the upcoming Psy-Changeling novels/anthology next year.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is a fun game to waste a few minutes if you're waiting for someone or have a little time to burn at, say, the airport.

1455502758|5.0|Christopher Hitchens... in print... yet again. What could be more agreeable?<br /><br />At the memorial service in April at Cooper Union, dearest friend, Martin Amis, generously shared some personal memories and, most movingly, reminded us that one of Hitch's favorite expressions for assessing those famous boozy intellectual gatherings he so thoroughly enjoyed was \\"What could be more agreeable?\\"<br /><br />To be sure, it was a rhetorical question (with 'nothing could be' as the implied answer) in that ultimate setting. In any other application the question would surely leave room for improvement toward that coveted scenario. Hence,<br /><br />Christopher Hitchens in print...<br />[What could be more agreeable?] >>> Christopher Hitchens via audio/video.<br />[More agreeable still?] >>> The Hitch IN PERSON. Indeed!<br /><br />Sadly now, that's no longer possible -- the subject of this book being a chronicle of that grim development. But this book, unique among his publications, most closely bridges the gap between the printed word and the bon vivant himself (seen here still reluctant as ever to quit a party.) Within its narrow covers (100+ pages) Christopher Hitchens rejoins us this final time with a full measure of his characteristic wit and incomparable charm, even in the face of grave adversity. Reporting the peculiarities and indignities of a life struggling under the increasing tyranny of cancer, his words had me in many turns laughing, wincing, weeping, uplifted, enlightened, shattered, and grieving. The passages where he describes the routine of having his blood drawn is indelibly memorable.<br /><br />The content (certainly not so much the grim topic) of 'Mortality' provides at last a very welcome augmentation to Hitchens's prior biographical memoir, 'HITCH-22'. Whereas 'HITCH-22' dealt largely with his sociopolitical DOINGS in the context of a wider world, 'Mortality' offers very much more about his personal BEING -- an intimate glimpse of the remarkable manwithin. Further, the tender afterword by his wife, Carol Blue, strikes exactly the right sentimental tone of closest familiarity (such as Thanksgiving dinners at the Hitchens household) and thus contributes mightily to that sought-for theme of personal intimacy and revelation regarding The Hitch -- gentleman, friend, husband, and father. For bringing that personal element to the overall Hitchens bibliography, this book is indispensable.<br /><br />I was pleased to acquire \\"Mortality' in hardcover on August 25th, fully ten days earlier than the September 4th release date that I had been anticipating. The book is nicely bound and is well-appointed with strong silky-smooth pages supporting an aesthetically ideal font and type size, thus making this little gem -- from a purely tangible standpoint -- the crown jewel in the Christopher Hitchens collection of publications.<br /><br />Physically this book is so nicely done, if you opt for the electronic version, or wait for the paperback edition, you will likely, eventually --  if you ever attain an opportunity for side-by-side comparison, regret that you didn't spring for the enviable hardcover edition. And a final word on the dust-jacket. While the front cover is simple, dark, and to-the-point, the back cover yields the entirety of its space to the perfect portrait of this dearly-departed gentleman, our brother, our comrade, our friend... \\"have you ever seen eyes so blue?\\" (as The Hitch himself was fond to say.)<br /><br />This very PERSONAL book... \\"What could be more agreeable?\\"

B0084IG7KC|2.0|First, I guess I gotta put out the disclaimer that I did not read the book.  However, I didn't see any problem following the movie.  I'm sure the movie left alot out from the book.  That's not my problem with the movie.  My issues with the movie is that it was just plain boringly dull.  Absolutely nothing special or even remotely amusing.  Why?<br /><br />* Zero character development - There is not one single reason to care for ANY of the characters.  Why should the lead character win?  She's nothing special.<br />* False leads - In the beginning we are lead to believe that the lead character is something special and that everyone is betting on her to win the game.  Why?  The ONLY amazing thing she did was shoot one bird out of the sky with an arrow.  Then for the rest of the movie she has to have her neck saved by others EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Not once did she ever save her own neck without the help of someone else.<br />* Predictable - It was easy to follow because there were absolutely no surprises.  Even the so-called tricky ending was obvious a mile away.  Sorry, but it was.<br />* Why didn't the band of \\"bad guys\\" kill the boy friend after he served his purpose of finding the lead character?  They said they would, but then he is left alive.<br />* Why didn't they simply shoot her out of the tree or throw a knife?  Again, lame.<br />* For folks who are so amazed at how the lead character stepped in for her little sister, really?  Wouldn't you?  I didn't see any big deal there.<br />* Not an original story.  Think:  Matrix, Gamer, Demolition Man, Lord of the Flies, Running Man, Logan's Run, The Island...  Point being, I can't even give it kudos for \\"original\\" story.  That'd be fine if it was at least a good movie.  It wasn't.  It wasn't completely rotten, however.  The acting was fine.  The SFX were okay.  Elizabeth Banks' character was fantastically amusing....<br /><br /> But the movie itself as a whole....  It was just nothing special and will easily be forgotten.  When they added the beasts near the end of the story to expedite the ending to the game, I was glad & agreed fully.  I too couldn't wait for it to end.n.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Classic Norah Jones with beautifully written songs that speak to your soul. This album is pure emotion and you'll find favorites that you'll return to for many years to come.
B004HWT6DO|4.0|Awesome!  Very interesting story and an amazing performance by Eisenberg.  Nothing bad about the film.  It \\"could\\" have had a little more background to the characters and been a little heavier on details.  Hardly a criticism though.  A fine film.<br /><br />Once again we are taught that the way to financial succes is on the backs of others - even your friends.  lol  And that Zuckerberg is more like Bill Gates than I ever knew.  Both seem to be d-bags to anyone who befriended them when they were nothing but complete nerds.<br /><br />FWIW & just my opinion, I've often noticed how nerds bring the dislike of nerds on themselves.  They are often self centered & either unaware or uncaring of others' feelings and then wonder why no one likes them.  If Zuckerberg were cool and talked to people like he does in this film we'd all be calling him a jerk.  Remember this the next time you feel sorry for \\"the nerd\\".  People often get what they give.  Man, what a film!  Sorry for going off there, but that's what watching this film did for me.  Got me to thinking, alot.  Bill Gates and MarK Zuckerberg:  two of the riches people in the world and 2 that screwed over their friends.  Wow!<br /><br />Watch this!

B0014DQSGW|2.0|Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a pro bono lawyer passionately devoted to saving the community from rapacious developers.  One day she is lying on the pavement between an historic building and the wrecker's ball when she meets playboy George (Hugh Grant), the public spokesman for the very corporation that wants to knock down the landmark.  George is between lawyers at the moment (his CEO brother fired the last one), and when he finds out Lucy actually has a degree from Harvard, he impulsively offers her a job and a promise to spare her Coney Island rec center.<br /><br />And from there on it was just annoying.  A couple of critics called this screenplay undernourished; I'd say emaciated.  The best romantic comedies have a busy, likable supporting cast to add layers of interest and tone to the primary storyline (remember Notting Hill and While You Were Sleeping?); Grant and Bullock were pretty much on their own.  The two of them, mostly just the two of them, George`s outrageous insensitivity and Lucy's indignation in the same tiresome pattern that begged for denouement long before Lucy finally gave her two weeks' notice.  What bridesmaid leaves her cell phone on at the altar of her best friend's wedding, anyway?  And it still took too long for this to end.  Grant had a lot of witty one-liners; but I thought he was too offhand, as if contemptuous of the material.  Bullock was charming, but not charming enough to save this mess.<br /><br />Obviously, production costs were kept to the minimum.  Locations were unvaried, supporting cast almost invisible, cinematography bland, clothes blah.  Bullock as Producer must have figured that two big stars would bring in the audience before word spread how awful this really was.  And she thought this romantic comedy was so good, she couldn't possibly make a better one?  I'm pretty charitable when it comes to a movie of this genre.  It only has to look good, sound good, and make me feel good.  This one was zero for three.<br /><br />I've learned something.  If you're reading these reviews in order to decide whether or not to purchase the dvd, don't go by \\"Most Helpful\\" reviews.  People get on here and vote Yes, it was helpful, when they have already seen the movie and agree with the review.  This tends to inflate positive reviews.  Instead, look at the star rating profile at the top.  If most people really loved the movie and you probably will, too, the profile will have a bulge at 5 stars tapering down smoothly to a very thin or non-existent tail at 1.  If instead of a smooth descent from 5 the distribution is lumpy; or especially if 1-plus-2's add up to about the same as the 5's, maybe you ought to rent first.

And its the usual, dull presentations of lessons learned, lord...if you are compelled to do this, at least make it interesting and as unique as possible, the movie \\"Hall Pass\\" suffered from the same problem, and its this kind of predictability along with a lack of humor that kills these movies.<br /><br />I had to abandon this movie before it ended, so I would highly recommend avoiding it.

0345803485|4.0|Good books but not great. The plot to the story just seems so ordinary. There wasn't much drama and it seemed to me that most of Christian's issues were resolved by the middle of the second book. From what I gathered at first, Ana was suppose to be helping him be less dominate, not embrace his lifestyle. I had read other reviews and talked to people that had read the books first, but still decided to give them a try. I would recommend them if your a person that doesn't like reading alot of drama and like a story that is somewhat erotic.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|While this game will never headline your gaming night it is a great little 'filler' game or for those quick sessions you are needing. What a cool little dice game.<br /><br />What comes with it:<br /><br />13 dice<br />Cup<br />Rule Book<br /><br />How to Play:<br /><br />On your turn you shake up the dice in the cup, take out three and roll them. Three dice outcomes will happen: Roll brains, roll shots or roll runners. You have to keep the brains and shots and re-roll the runners taking from the cup the amount of dice needed to get our dice number up to three. If you roll three shots your turn is over and you lose the brains for that turn only. So, it is a bit of knowing when to quit.<br /><br />How you win:<br /><br />Be the first person with a total of 13 brains, then everyone has one last turn. If there is a tie, those people take one last turn and who ever has the most brians wins.<br /><br />Great game. Simple but fun. Really for as many players as you can muster.

A few creative plot twists peppered in really helped give the story even more depth.<br /><br />And for those of you not sure about the \\"poetry\\" aspect of the storyline - I must say I ended up enjoying it more than I initially thought I would.  I actually think it helped to give the characters another layer.<br /><br />If your looking for a good, heartfelt story...give this book (and also Point of Retreat) a try - I don't think you'll be sorry!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|have had a blast playing. only one so far has tripped me up....I will never give in. if you enjoy brain games this is the fun one to pick. :)
034580404X|1.0|Oh my.<br /><br />What a load of utter rubbish.<br /><br />My eyes darkened as I read this book, not with lust, with agony. How could something written SO badly become so popular?! It was terrible. Over the top. Unrealistic. Repetitive. Corny. Degrading. Silly. How many 27 year olds do you know who are CEOs of their own companies, earn 100,000 dollars an hour, fly helicopters and planes, play the piano, buy their girlfriends Audi R8s for their birthdays?<br /><br />If I could give this trilogy 0, or even minus something, I would.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The books were awesome! They were really entertaining! The books kept me interested. I couldn't seem to put them down once I started to read them !
B004W4N55C|2.0|Great app but crashes on ifs (android 4.0). Easy fix but lazy devs. Cmon time for an update. While ur at it make it future compatible.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|AWESOME GAME very fun and entertaining. It is easy to learn but gets more challenging to keep you interested az you play
B006OCM0G0|1.0|This app was not for us. Everytime we did anything it was soooo slow. We had to tap everything too many times. When we tried to expand the restaurant it kept crashing and saying the game's out of sync or we aren't connected to the internet even if we were. Not recommended
B001AUEMFS|5.0|This product was great and easy to purchase. I love Coldplay and the digital download was easy and fast.  Excellent service!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is probably the best bang-for-the-buck quad core CPU out there as of press time! If you're like me and don't game but instead do CPU intensive operations such as video encoding, then this is the CPU for you. The integrated HD4000 graphics are on par with a \\"decent\\" mid-range GPU & power consumption is quite low on these Ivy Bridge CPUs. The lower power consumption of the Ivy Bridge CPUs will pay for it self over time if you live in an area with high electricity rates.<br /><br />Enough has been written about the performance of these CPUs, so here's my setup & results:<br />Gigabyte GA-Z77-DS3H BIOS rev F6<br />i5-3570k (Costa Rica Fab) OC'd to 3.8GHz<br />Cooler Master Hyper 212+ CPU Cooler<br />Samsung 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 OC'd to 1800MHz<br />Samsung 830 series 128GB SSD<br />Cooler Master Elite 430 Case<br />Cooler Master eXtreme 500W PSU<br /><br />Idle: 1600MHz, 45W at PSU, 28C at CPU<br />Max Load: 3800MHz, 90-95W at PSU, 58C at CPU [Handbrake High Profile H.264 encode]<br /><br />Using Win8 RP, but will switch to Mountain Lion soon.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|Mr Grey must be Superman He can anytime anyplace as often as he wants. Well written but too much \\"holy shit\\" in the text shows a little limit in word  treasure
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love being able to put a puzzle together and not lose puzzle pieces. the dog can't eat the pieces.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I owned the previous DVD edition of \\"Jaws\\" and decided to upgrade to the Blu-ray after reading a glowing review about the transfer in Entertainment Weekly. I wasn't disappointed. The film looks better than I've ever see it before. It is almost as if extra lighting was placed in some of the scenes. The picture is crisp, colorful and pops off the screen. The moonlit scenes, chiefly the opening sequence, is stunning in its clarity. I also noticed how incredible the sound is. The scene where Quint runs his nails down the chalkboard never really bothered me before but here it is excruciating. Plentiful extras include 2 documentaries, the best being the most recent \\"The Shark is Still Working\\" which contains fascinating interviews with actors (even those in bit parts) and an intimate look at Verna Fields studio. The older documentary is a bit sluggish and repetitive but sill worth a look. Unfortunately, no commentary. This Blu-ray edition is a must have for fans!
B00004XPPB|1.0|I've heard of 3-D movies, but this one is 1-D--as in the characters are all one dimensional.  Now, Depp does a good job within the limits of the script, but once again, Al Pacino is doing his Al Pacino imitation, or better said, his imitation of someone else doing an Al Pacino imitation. If this guy isn't the most overrated actor in the world, he'll do until that guy comes along. Cliche ridden, dese and dose dialogue, and a bucket of blood thrown in to keep you awake.  This is one of the poorer mob movies, so make sure you give it to someone you don't love. In fact, after watching, throw the DVD in the air and shoot it repeatedly. Couldn't hurt.
0393316041|5.0|This was my first book of Mr. Feynman. It is fantastic. It took me to his childhood imaginations and my childhood exprience. I enjoyed it very much and hoping to read all his other books.  I would have had more ideas if I read this book before my book, Self - A Delusion?
B008M34IJG|5.0|I enjoyed it. The HD comes in just fine. The price could be less.But you don't ever have to leave the house, which is nice.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this quirky post-apocalyptic series. It is rather spare and lacks much action but the concept is intriguing enough and the author manages to create a great deal of suspense and tension within this style. There is just enough hints and clues about what might come next that you are pulled along furtively trying to figure out the next move-trying to understand what is the truth behind this world underground. Add in the fact that you get five books for six bucks and it was one of my better purchases.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love using this app. thank you lifechurch.tv. I love using this app at church on my kindle. I would reccomend this app to anyone.
B008MEM24S|2.0|Its just a copy of where's my water but a different title and goal. They make it so hard and I hate it.
0307352145|4.0|An important thing to note is that Cain confuses introverts with the highly sensitive.  What she's really describing are characteristics of highly sensitive people, about 30% of whom, based on studies, are actually extraverts.  According to Elaine Aron, who has done research and written extensively in this area, Cain was told this during her research, but being a lawyer by training rather than a research psychologist, she didn't grasp it. With that caveat, the book is worth looking through, especially by the  80% of the population who are not sensitive and who, for the most part, don't get or are just oblivious to internal lives of the other 20%.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|There have been few nature series with the landmark status of this one.  Even after a decade or so, the look is still stunning and the patience of the many photographers is more and more appreciated.  I like Sigourney Weaver as an actor, but I'm also happy that an American BluRay release features the voice of David Attenborough.  Who else is there?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app its awesome and always pops up when I put it in the kindle.... I'm out of things to say and I need 5 more things to say!!
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I loved The Forever Girl and I loved Her Sweetest Downfall.<br /><br />Her Sweetest Downfall is a wonderful story that gives a behind the scenes look at The Forever Girl.<br /><br />The characters are well-developed, the plot is paced perfectly for a novella, and the romance in this book rings true.<br /><br />I almost cried at one point, that's how real the romance feels when reading Her Sweetest Downfall.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next Forever Girl book!
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I heard Greg Porter on a radio I stream daily from San Mateo, CA while working.  I didn't initially write down the title \\"On My Way to Harlem\\".  By the second time I heard the song streaming into my office; I had written down his name and title of song, album.  This guy has successfully created a young new sound while maintaining \\"the cool\\" traditionalists like me love... All titles on this album are new favs of mine and I've already shared with friends & family to enjoy.  I will soon purchase previous albums released by Mr. Porter.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love all of the customizable features. The app allows you to choose an infinite combo of sounds and layer them over each other for a personalized experience. You can adjust the volume of each choice individually and save the combo. I can't figure out how to get it to play while other apps are running, so I can play music while reading. If I could get it to do that, it would be perfect. It was doing that when I first loaded it, but it seems to have stopped.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This is a classy collection of johnny cash hits that will definately entertain. Simply put no johnny cash cd is bad!!!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|The movie started with some intensity...and then we lose a bit of time for the<br />film to introduce you to all involved...and then the action starts and does'nt<br />let you go till the end like any good movie would.  I did enjoy this movie...dont<br />look too hard and you might also enjoy it.<br />  If you like alien invasion films...classic or new...you should enjoy this one<br />also.<br />A keeper ...saw it on my computer...and now will purchase the Blue Ray ...of course.
0307716988|3.0|[[ASIN:0307716988 Moonwalk]]<br /><br />This book was so, so.  Michael provided incite on some things but not enough about anything.  It also appeared to me that there were two different writing styles: one by a student and one style by an adult.  But what I want to say is that the copy that I purchased as new was indeed used.  I contacted the seller about my concern that it wasn't a new copy and was very pleased with the response from the seller, IFORGOTMYNAME.  She told me that my receiving a used copy instead of an new copy was a mistake and to make up for the mistake, she refunded my purchase immediately.  I initially didn't think that I would use this seller again but with the positive response I received, I've changed my mind and will purchase again from IFORGOT MY NAME.  Remember her name, she's professional and honest.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Loved  Thor, Iron Man, Green Lantern and Captain America movies, and i like this<br />one also. But it seems a big portion of the first part is dedicated to Looki and<br />finally after a while the big invasion starts....Still for such a invasion, there<br />is little death and blood and for so many aliens and new technology...they kinda<br />get beaten back pretty fast. I still recommend this films...but i think i like<br />Battleship better..they won ...and without super heroes...
B003UV8ZS0|4.0|With the upcoming adaptation of this book coming to theatres, I remember my sister raving about it and had to give it a spin. The novel is amazing in and of itself, I have to problems suggesting it to anyone with an interest in metaphysical, religious or allegorical discussions. The e-book edition has some small problems:<br /><br />1) Typos. Not sure if this is a product of the actual print edition, but there was a noticeable amount of mispellings<br /><br />2) Placement of Illustrations. This is the illustrated edition and the paintings are beautiful, but in the ebook edition they sometimes occur out of place and break the flow of the narration. Also, I read on a black and white kindle device, so I don't know if they are rendered better on a color device: some were excessively dark.<br /><br />But if all you want is to have the book, you could do a lot worse than this edition.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Loved this game more than angry birds! I could play games like this over and over. Nothing bad to say really.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I can't add much to what other reviewers have said. The information contained in this app and the way it's presented are stellar. Rotatable 3-D representations of the knots and the animations showing how they're tied are extremely helpful in understanding and tying the knots. The written information about each knot is not only useful, but interesting for the glimpse into history it provides.<br /><br />If you're like me, and need an occasional knot but not often enough to remember how to tie it, this app is a must-have.<br /><br />Works great on my Samsung SGH-T989 Galaxy S II with Android 4.0.3.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Now this is what I call incredible, Lively full of suspense wonderful ideas for the storyline with great talent from Hugh Jackman and the performers, I can say that it was terrific and what more than to have robots bash the living daylights out of each other,I wont say too much the entertainment is full on with mind filling enjoyment plenty of action thrills and spills just a little touch of comedy. I rated this show an A plus, a must for your private dvd collection. Relax enjoy worth viewing with the drinks and calories. Judge for yourself its for everyone in the family, a pleasure to watch.
B008X8RSTM|4.0|The rendering of maps is glacially slow, even on a quad core Tegra-3 based device. The iOS version works so much better, and is a lot less glitchy, even on older, slower devices. Offline maps in Google Maps render an order of magnitude faster and look so much nicer- please do something about your renderer under Android :D That said, this app does work, it does the job and the price is fair- just it will find it hard to keep up, at this rate..
B005LAIGW8|5.0|A great movie with all the happenings of the first one but not quite as good, Strongly recommended if you still want the thrills spills and suspense as Nicholas Cage can only perform. Different to all other shows and that is saying something, storyline is there, the talent of all the actors are fantastic worth putting on the telly with munchies in hand and relaxing with friends catching up on local dvds. I enjoyed this wonderful movie, I rated this movie an A plus and worth putting in the collections box. Can't say to much and spoil it for you all and leave you with no imagination can I.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book! Absolutely Amazing!! I read a few other reviews and I almost didnt read the book because some of the review were disappointing; however they were wrong...you have to read it!
0307956350|3.0|I just finished the audio cd format of The ExPats. I almost gave up about cd 3. But, for whatever reason, I continued \\"reading\\" to the end. The premise behind the plot was interesting. However, the numerous chronological flip flops and overall lack of characters with any sort of personality, dampened my interest. I realize that several characters were spies, but surely spies have an inner life.<br /><br />In order for me to enjoy a book this long, at least some characters should have enough personality to intrigue me enough to want to see what happens to them. Perhaps, if the reader had been allowed to \\"know\\" the characters, it would have been too difficult for Pavone to construct his premise for the plot. Also, there were just too many sequences that seemed unnecessary to the story line. With some good editing, I believe that The Expats could have been a fun read.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book kept me guessing and wondering at every turn. I finished this book in one day, I just couldn't put it down! Great read!
0756405890|5.0|This book revives the ancient art of storytelling. Its not about fast moving plot but living through the characters. Rothfuss lets you feel like you know the characters. This book is one of my new favorites. If you want to lose yourself in the characters of a story then this book is for you. If you need fast moving plot and non-stop action then you may not enjoy this story. But I would recomend this book to anyone who want to sit down with a great book and fade away from the world for hours and hours!
0439023513|4.0|This was a great book and I definitely enjoyed reading the conclusion to the Hunger Games triology.  My main complaint about the book is how quicly the author ends the story.  After writing 2-3 years over 3 books, the final year is in a paragraph or two, it almost felt like she was just tired of writing.  Other than that, great read.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I received these promptly within 2 days, and couldn't wait to try it on my daily run (I as many here HATE ear buds, as I have to keep pressing them back in, and over the ears just shift around). When I first plugged em into my iPod, all I got was static and I was pretty pissed, I gave it a wiggle and it worked with a little static remaining. I decided what the hell, I cant return em now so I gave em a shot, and the static cleared completely up, and it worked perfectly as soon as I got outside. It was great, I didn't have to adjust a thing the entire run! Even jumping over pot holes and cobble streets, they stayed in!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I have been an Amazon customer from the very beginning of the company, and this is the first review out of the hundreds (yes) of items that I have purchased from them.  The Tree of Life is an incredible film - powerful, beautiful, and important.  It talks about those things that really matter in life - why we are here - and the small and large injustices that happen along the way (see the Book of Job).  I saw this movie on the fifth anniversary of my own father's passing, and it gave me a new understanding both of that event and of his life and our relationship as well.  That is an awful lot to be taken away from a film - and I am grateful for it.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is obviously sad, but it also shows how much strength this woman had to overcome what is probably one of the worst situations you could ever be put in. Her motivation and strength to keep positive for her future and that of her children's was incredible. I could not put this book down. I always read books from others that are seeing the story from their eyes, not the actual individual that went thru the ordeal. The courage that she had throughout her ordeal and after is simply amazing.
B006FE83UE|5.0|This DVD came just in time. I had a report due and i was able to watch this movie and do the report. THe DVD was priced right and with a timely delivery.
B003DFLZB2|5.0|A beautiful score of music. Makes you feel like you are right there with Batman. Tenderness in emotional scenes with Christian Bale and Michael Caine. Wonderfully put together and recommended listening:)
B00425S1H8|5.0|When we could not get a pci card with serial port to run properly on a Windows 7 machine, we tried this adapter.  Honestly, I didn't have high hopes after the frustration with the pci card.  I installed the drivers from the pluggables web site, plugged in the usb adapter, and it immediately installed to com9.  I used the device manager properties to change it to com1, and everything worked perfectly!  Very relieved, this inexpensive adapter is well worth the money.  Looks to be a quality item, and the bottom line is it works.  We are very pleased and would purchase another without hesitation if the need arises.

B008BIN9EW|5.0|I am playing the campaign now, finished one race. I have not tried online play yet. A very solid game for an enthusiast but casual player like me. I got as free app, might be worth waiting for a discounted price though seems to have enough play possibilities for full price purchase.

034580404X|5.0|This book order \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" has been great. I can't put it down.  I have finished Book I, and almost finished Book II.  When I finish the last book, Book III, I think it is going to be very hard to find another series of books that will captivate my attention as this.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|it is so fun and a must have if you love fighting games. you can play single or multiplayer so fun
B00180R06I|4.0|Love Criterion. Love this film. I own the Image version and I noticed that the Criterion version is missing a crucial scene. In the Image version we see the stake being driven into the vampire. The Criterion version glosses over this key scene. Had anyone notived this???

B00884GR0W|3.0|This is a good game for those who like Minecraft, though it is not a Minecraft clone. My only complaint: I keep glitching. You can place blocks in yourself, and when you do that, you cannot move out of them. Fix that and you will have a very good game.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I love this game. when I first started i though this is going to be boring but then a spider lady came out of nowhere. that was amazing practicly blue up my mind
0767802519|5.0|Everyone who get's a chance to see this film raves about it.  Jean Reno and a young Natalie Portman are phenomenally cast.  I've seen it a dozen times and will watch it a dozen more times.  Not a chick flick but poignant all the same.  Violence but not for violence sake.  You fall in love with both characters.  The ending is perfect.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm not sure if I like the update or not. It's okay I guess, but the regular version is WAY better.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|lots of fun. alot like Mario game. would likeifitwould save your progress but like I said it like the original Mario game.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|\\"Jiro Dreams Of Sushi\\" is an absolutely wonderful documentary about 85 year old Jiro Ono, a man renown as being the world's greatest sushi chef. And not only is director David Gelb's film a portrait of a man who has found what he loves doing and has literally made it his life but, an in-depth look at the traditions and ways of the making of sushi from the picking out of the best fish to all the precise preparations. All this is told through the eyes of Jiro and his oldest son and heir to his restaurant, Yoshikazu. We learn about a Jiro, a perfectionist and traditionalist who rarely is away from his 10 seat restaurant situated in a Tokyo subway station, as he prepares his sushi and teaches his son and apprentices an art he has crafted to perfection. It's hard not to admire and be inspired by a man who truly loves what he does and works tirelessly making sure everything is perfect every day. Despite being an intensely demanding man he remains a very happy and charming one and it's hard not to like Jiro and why would you not want to? And if the heartwarming story of the energetic master Jiro and his world famous sushi restaurant is not enough, this may be the most loving ode to sushi itself ever committed to film. A truly fascinating documentary about a truly fascinating and admirable man. I can't recommend this documentary enough.
B008602KQI|3.0|We heard a lot on this movie, rented and saw on friday night. Movie is haveing very good story and  picturization. I expected more on adventure front but it is not delivered however I heard that there are going to be 2 more parts so looking forward the missing pieces in those. Best Luck to movie director.
B006LSZECO|1.0|What a disappointment. It starts out slow but starts to build interest so I stuck with it only to be disappointed in the ending. I can only hope there is no sequel planned.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews.
B007HJ9JEA|5.0|I had missed an episode some how when watching rented blue rays so it was convenient to stream this episode from amazon.  The streaming worked great to my xbox360.  Initially a little bit confusing navigating to it using the xbox ap but I figured it out and was happy with the results.  Not as pretty as the blue ray but good enough.
B002SJ8FH6|5.0|I went in to this movie expecting a fun old thriller to play in the background while I got some work done. I thought, hey, I'll laugh at its cheesiness and enjoy some of the few good parts it'll have from Hitchcock's brilliance peeking through.<br /><br />Well, I got absolutely zero work done and just watched this movie from start to finish. For some reason the tension hit me hard, and the characters and acting had me from moment one. The main character is so charming, but also so frantic and worried at times that he never seems unrelatable. There is a slight bit of cheese, but the awesome plot twists and the great political rally scene make this movie a must see. I am planning on buying a physical copy of it as soon as I can!
0307891402|5.0|Very useful for playing Skyrim.  The detailed walk throughs are good but the various charts were much more valuable.  The online map included via a code was also pretty useful at times.  The book is fairly attractive as well and makes a decent collectible if you are looking for something along that line.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This headphone has really been the best of the best since the inception about 30 years ago.  There is no surprise that it is still the most wanted one in the market.  I tried Beats which costs 3X more at the Apple store; just to find out that there is really no comparison with regards to the quality and dynamic of sound.  The only suggestion that I can come up with is more fashionable design due to the fact that most people would wear the set not for studio monitoring, but for enjoying music and making fashion statement.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Movies are great and the blue ray transfer seems good.  The packaging with this set is pretty cheap, but if you only care about the movies it won't matter.  Menus on some of the discs are not very good and some movies have good extra content and others have limited extra content.
B000WTDUQK|5.0|My daughter needed this book for high school reading.  It arrived as described.  I it so convenient to be able to find the books you need in one place.

B002BZOVLG|5.0|It should be mentioned that although this is a conventional (and visually beautiful) production, it isn't so<br />conventional as an interpretation of the opera.  The opera supports many interpretations, but this one is a little different.<br /><br />Strangely enough this is Cosi Fan Tutte as a love story--Fiordiligi finds her Albanian suitor as the true love of her life.<br /><br />Sex and love are obviously central to the opera, but what is different in this production is the focus on the sexual awakening of the women as a central theme.  While the first act demonstrates that the four principals have much to lose with Don Alphonso's trials, the second act treats the seduction as a kind of triumph of the women's sexual development--regardless of what provoked it.  Fiordiligi's final seduction scene is a climactic love scene, and at the end of the opera she is reluctant to give up her chosen partner.<br /><br />With such emphasis on the sexual nature of the relationships, no reconciliation is imaginable at the end.  (In this production the locket is the least of it.)  So the final scene is grim--the men can't see where to go, and the women are nowhere and in love with something that doesn't exist.<br /><br />It has to be said that the music does work for this interpretation--which is wonderfully sung and acted--but it sure makes<br />for heady stuff.<br /><br />For the sake of argument it is worth saying a few words about the composer's intent in this opera, because that much is actually pretty clear.<br /><br />- Most fundamentally this is a \\"patient Griselda\\" story turned upside down.  While it is in the format of old stories about wives undergoing abuse to test their faithfulness, in this case the women fail the test but the test itself is an act of treachery so complete as to eclipse what they have done. The whole affair seems strangely modern in the casualness of the evil.<br /><br />- Whether it is problematical in this opera or not, reconciliation is a primary theme of Mozart operas, so it has to be taken seriously.  That means the intent of the action is to push to the boundary of what is forgivable but not over, and the characters are left shaken but at least willing to go on with the rest of their lives.  From a musical point of view, the beautiful ensemble that precedes the final chorus (abbreviated here) is certainly to be taken seriously.<br /><br />- Finally the opera is about sex and love without being either amoral or prudish in its conclusion.  The women are overwhelmed by what hits them and are so unprepared for it that they can only call for the maid when it starts.  They have been through a kind of parallel universe that they have to reconcile with reality.  Musically the key changes mark how far they have gone and come back.y theme of Mozart operas, so it has to be taken seriously.

They have been through a kind of parallel universe that they have to reconcile with reality.  Musically the key changes mark how far they have gone and come back.
034580404X|5.0|once i started these books i couldn't put them down.<br />I read all three in 9 days and i don't read to many<br />books.  You just didn't know what was going to happen<br />next!!!
0307744434|4.0|Before the book:<br />Before reading book, I had been fan-girling for a LONG time! I wanted the book like there was no other. And when I finally had the chance to read it, I jumped on it.<br /><br />First impression:<br />When the story started, I was captivated. I loved the story! It was very unique. I was disturbed by Celia's father, Hector, who taught Celia in the most gorey way. Poor Celia was abused. I got so angry while reading the story, I just want to read on and hope on the ending. When Marco appeared, I REALLY want a happy ending! Marco is just the perfect young English man. I still remember when I read the first chapter, I immediately thought of this book has a similar feel to Water for Elephant.<br /><br />I loved how the story is not base on romance, but magic. As I mentioned before Hector's teaching style is like authoritarian while Alexander, Marco's \\"teacher\\" was passive. I love the time setting, the turn of 1800 is just a magical time by itself and when you add real magic to it. It is like an explosion! I love the change in POVs. :) But I'm sad to say that I don't like how there are so many characters that you can lose track of them.<br /><br />Later Into the Book:<br />The story began to slow. Sometimes it feel like I read for hours but never seems to move anywhere. I think this was because the story is very descriptive so it allows the readers to see and feel what Erin wanted the readers to feel. This got in the way of the plot. The story was just like a boat without its orbs, going no where. I was quite disappointed parts of the book where it lacked in action. There was a lot of description, and talking, never anything happening. I was hoping for some SHAZAM!<br /><br />I did love the language used by Erin. As the story progress, I saw what more of Erin's writing and felt in love with . It was the kind of fit between sophistication and simple communication. You just can tell Erin is not just a wannabe writer that just had a good idea for a book. She actually know how to write. Her style is complex but not like you have to read the sentence a few times over to understand it. To tell you the truth I really want to write like that.<br /><br />As I realized how she uses her language, the story became complex. From making the different ways the magicians use their powers to the delicate details of the circus is just so brilliant. I cannot imagine how much planning went into this book! I also really enjoy the conversations between the characters. They were all so witty, serious, and whimsical. I particularly enjoy the conversation between Celia and Marco when they first actually had a full conversation. This is because they seem to converse like two intelligent lawyers arguing in a subtle way, both counter with sassy comments, but you know they were flirting, j'adore! ♥<br /><br />I love the subtle love story. It was not like a YA novel where it always seems like a forced love; Erin doesn't make the love story appear fast. It was like a slow cooker; it cook at a low temperature but the result was tender food. It was just like the love story, beautiful and exotic in its own way. That said, this love was scattered through the half end because of all the POVs.<br /><br />When I got more into the book, it reminded be of Howl's Moving Castle because of all the magic and the twisted imagination. Sometimes it gets confusing and amazing at the same time.<br /><br />Final Thought:<br />This book was great but it didn't live quite to my expectations. I wanted more actions and \\"dark magic\\" feel to it. I want the night to explode with evil clowns and axe killers, but I guess that was not Erin was trying to do. Overall, this book was a 4 out of 5 stars.She actually know how to write. Her style is complex but not like you have to read the sentence a few times over to understand it.

B003X5UDEW|5.0|Great Movie!  Fantastic Action scenes and it actually has a decent plot.  I immediately had to watch IP Man 2 after that.
0385738773|3.0|I read the first book a few years ago, and did not enjoy it that much. The plot was cool but slow. The ending was too gorry with vivid description of death and battles. Normally I would be go for with battles and actions but everything was overdone.<br />When I finally got around reading the second book, it was brilliant. Sure, there was few gross head-cutting description but it was suspenseful. I never knew what danger was going to appear in the scorch. To tell you the truth I was scared of reading the book at night, but it was a good kind of scare.<br />The ending of the second was really good, frustrating but good. I immediatly wanted to read the last book but didn't get a chance until now.<br /><br />The third book started out REALLY boring. James seemed to force some action into it by describing awesome guns and the fight between the guards and the children. It was not working. :(<br />When the children finally get to see what the world was like, it was just as boring as the most boring part in the second book, which was when Brenda and Thomas was at that stupid club. BORING! Oh, this reminds me of the stupid back and forth of Thomas' relationship between the two girls. Thomas was such a winer! Oh, I hate Teressa because she betrayed me. Oh I feel for Brenda but I don't know, she betrayed me too. I got sooooo sick of this and that was just few chapters in (this is extremely bad when the chapters are short).<br />I also did not like how the plot slowed because of Newt. I'm not going to say anymore....<br />I did not have a connection between the book. When people died, I felt that I did not care at all whether they died or suffered. I have to say that I was caught off guard by the closing section of the book but it didn't make up some of the disappointing parts in the book.<br />The ending was predictable after it was revealed, if you know what I mean. It was a quasi-original ending. You will think that \\"oh cool, wait, that is a lot of the Hollywood movie endings...boo?\\"<br /><br />There were sad, surprising, and scary parts but overall, it was not as good as the second one but I guess it was ok a book.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />PS: a better trilogy got to be Atherton trilogy by Patrick Carman.s...boo?\\"<br /><br />There were sad, surprising, and scary parts but overall, it was not as good as the second one but I guess it was ok a book.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />PS: a better trilogy got to be Atherton trilogy by Patrick Carman.

B008ODZNLG|5.0|The filming is beautiful, you'll never see sushi look so good on camera. It made me so hungry and I had just eaten two tacos. I am ashamed because I complain about my job all the time and this guy has been doing the same thing every day for 75 years and says he still loves it and is striving for perfection. I have hated my job pretty much every year I've worked.
B0013Q1VJO|5.0|I purchased this product for $15.00.  For what it costs for a regular DVD, I got three.  The visuals are terrifec along with the redone songs.  The movie takes place between a few years time.  This movie should have been huge.  \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" was my favorite.  The only thing that could be better is if the bundle also came with the cd.

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire<br />The Hunger Games Book Two<br />By Suzanne Collins<br /><br />Katniss has inadvertently started a revolution with the way she won the Hunger Games, bringing her to the forefront of President Snow's attention. This year when the Hunger Games are announced it is on a \\"special occasion\\" and this year's contestants will be chosen out of the winners of the previous Games. So once again Katniss is thrown into the arena to fight for her life and hopefully protect Peeta whom she has come to care for more than she realized.<br /><br />This book was interesting but not as good as the beginning, the relationships that Katniss forms in this book are not as provoking as they were in the previous one though the author does introduce a myriad of characters who become unlikely allies who compromise an interesting outlook from the previous novel. The progression of the story was exciting and necessary, but hopefully Suzanna Collins can bring the lost romance back into the third book even though the progression between Peeta and Katniss is fun it was often times too subtle. I can't wait to read Mockingjay the third and final book of the Hunger Games Trilogy to see what will happen next.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Well not the best book I have ever read. Had to read it after all the publicity. Badly written and not much of a story to it. Plenty of sex education.Eye opening stuff. In fact so much so that it becomes quite tedious. I did start the second book due to the way the first book ended. Thought there would be more of a story but just more sex. All problems get solved with sex... The whole story is rather unrealistic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|super fun and super cool. you'll love this app.I know I do. its my favorite app I have. GET THIS APP!!!!!!!
1603090002|4.0|This is one of those cases. While the first two League volumes were taut stories that blended elements together so brilliantly as to resemble nuclear fusion, and Black Dossier was a love-it-or-hate-it 'sourcebook' whose references you needed to understand to even follow... I'm actually not sure what \\"Century: 1910\\" is supposed to be.<br /><br />It's competently done, of course. The art and presentation and every character's actions feel so natural and put together with such effortless mastery that you know from the first few pages that you're reading Moore. There's coloring that adds to the atmosphere of the scenes, lots of visual allusions to other works, all that stuff. The only problem is that as it goes on, this work becomes more about the references to fiction you might not have engaged with, and less about the central characters and story. I understand the charm of having every person, place and thing be part of this overworld of combined un-reality. The trouble is that the central plot for this (and all the \\"Century\\" books) is a little thin, and if you're not into Alistair Crowley and Moore's ideas about the collective unconscious, it'll make you roll your eyes. I don't follow the central conflict of these stories. From the first, the aim of the antagonists is vague and they don't have the substance of those from earlier in the series.<br /><br />It also indulges in something that's interesting to see attempted but hardly ever fulfilling, namely music in comics - I like reading lyrics, but can you really get into a musical you don't hear? As cleverly as it's implemented (especially in one dark, alley-treading scene of murder that's at once reminiscent of and an inversion of Alan Moore's other graphic novel \\"From Hell\\"), I don't feel like the comic is better for having had it than more pages of direct story.<br /><br />I mean, all right, if anyone was going to make a 1910-set story about stories colliding set to the score of \\"The Threepenny Opera\\" and centeredaround the prophesied magical baby from \\"The Moonchild,\\" then this is the best they could possibly do it. O'Neill's a goddamn master at putting details in every panel, Moore's operating on a different level from even other giant talents like Ellis and Morrison, them working together is always going to produce something stunning. It IS stunning. But unlike volumes one and two, and even Black Dossier, this doesn't feel vital. It's just a spot of fun, no matter how well put-together it is, and if there is a deeper charm to it, then it eludes me.<br /><br />If you want to get into the work of these creators, this is not the place to begin. Chances are that if you're a committed Leaguer, you'll already know it by this point and want to continue on with the series, but if you've felt doubt before now, try switching over to one of Alan Moore's other extraordinary works. Hell, even his run on WildC.A.T.S. feels like it has more thematic weight to it at times.
0307352145|3.0|The author, herself an introvert, chronicles of how our society evolved to emphasize the best of extroverts - the outgoing, fun-loving, talkative side of our culture which has in ways shunned the power of sometimes quiet and contemplative introverts. The good news is 1) Being and introvert does not mean being unfriendly or someone who doesn't like people and 2)Introverts equally bring strengths to society.<br /><br />As a self professed introvert, I wanted to love this book. Wrap myself in it and say, \\"hurrah\\" for introverts. And while I found lots of good things here (wore my highlighting finger out) in the end, Cain guides the reader to seek professionals to guide the misdirected introvert through the paths - especially when it comes to parents trying to figure out their own kids. Yikes!!!! Nothing like putting the old Scarlet Letter on your kid right out of the box. And while she mentions a lot of schooling options for parents, never once does she mention \\"homeschooling\\" as possibly a viable option for introverted children who might be struggling in an extremely extroverted classroom.<br /><br />Now there were lots of good things in here, too. Lots of studies that showed the strengths and weaknesses of both the introvert and the extrovert. The bottom line is - don't be afraid of who you are and what makes you comfortable and uncomfortable. Don't be afraid to push yourself outside that box, but play to your strengths and set yourself up for success. And above all - there is nothing wrong with being an introvert.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|There were some similarities between the protagonist and Jesus; although not in a purist sense, I see parallels:<br /><br />1. He is a sort of prophet/visionary<br />2. The scene at church where he loses it and flips over a table -- reminiscent of Jesus in the temple with the moneychangers<br />3. He is rejected and censured for not following local custom/expectations and taking risks<br />4. He does what he feels rightfully compelled to do although others see him as crazy<br />5. His descent into a tomb and arising \\"from the dead\\" into the light<br /><br />I definitely see how the storyline at least refers to parallels about a coming apocolypse as referred to in the Bible's book of Revelations.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Good game...good play...ok story...much fun...beautiful scenery.<br /><br />All quite well done.... the story line is a little weak but quite ok....everything else is just great.

B006HL9G10|5.0|At first I didn't use it as much, but now I found this app very help.  I have been using it to do sitting meditation (Chan).  It works very well.  I occasionally just the journaling mode.  I should do it more often though.  Anyway, this is an excellent app to help mesure the duration of your meditation. It serves its purpose.
B003P2WO5E|1.0|I enjoyed Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy, but after getting through 1/4th of this book I'm kinda like, \\"what's the point\\"?  He jumps around from scene to scene while you are trying to figure out what is going on.  I'm seriously debating just dropping it.  So far I'm totally bored with this book.
B00000DFSK|5.0|This CD contains all the very best of U-2.  I really enjoy this group.  I first really listened to them when I was stationed in the UK back in 1989-93.  I like there music then and I still enjoy it.  So just check it out.  I'm sure you will become a U-2 fan too.
B0073CNGCC|5.0|Kudo's! Outstanding! Watched First Season and searched away to watch 2nd season. Now am able to watch on Laptop 2nd Season. Please continue with Seasons. Not much to watch except Reruns (Yuck). I am loving PBS and the 'Original UK Version, Downton Abbey.'
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I typically read non-fiction but thought I'd give this book a try.  It was mildly entertaining and mildly enlightening.  It is a story but also a book that provides life lessons.  To me, it offers simple concepts that I feel, at age 34, I've already learned.
0618680004|3.0|This book just felt like someone constantly repeating his opinion, without actually proving or dis-proving whether a God of any kind exists or not. But there were worthy points such as stating that children are not born into a religion, but are made to follow one when growing up
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I am enjoying this bible.  It offers a lot to the anyone who really wants to understand the bible.  I appreciate all the study notes, the translation itself and the maps.  thanks
B008Y5OWI4|5.0|What is truth?  The answer, according to this brilliant film, is: impossible to know.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest films of all time.  The story, the cinematography, the directing and the amazing acting make it both puzzling and enthralling.<br /><br />Don't try to piece it together.  Don't try to figure it out.  There is absolutely no way.  Just accept the point that we often cannot know reality, but we must go on living anyway!
0307592731|5.0|I cried at the end, and that doesn't happen with many books.  I cried because I was so proud of her, and because the story was over.  I loved how she wrote about how she felt when she reached her destination, saying \\"thank you\\" over and over.  It is exactly what I would have done after enduring the journey she had endured, and feeling ecstatic that I was able to accomplish what I never thought I could accomplish.  I loved every page of this book, and how Cheryl shared her journey with detail and simplicity.  I loved the people that she met on the way, and the relationships they had.  The way she told this story left me glued to the book, and I just finished a lazy Sunday reading the last 3/4 of the book, because I couldn't stop thinking about it.  There are so many other reviews on the content of this book, that I felt I didn't need to cover that aspect.  This book is inspirational, and I LOVED watching Cheryl grow along her journey.<br /><br />As she reaches Crater lake and looks upon it, she ponders it's existence \\"This was once Mazama, I kept reminding myself.  This was once a mountain that stood nearly 12,000 feet tall and then had it's heart removed.  This was once a wasteland of lava and pumice and ash.  This was once an empty bowl that took hundreds of years to fill.  But hard as I tried, I couldn't see them in my mind's eye.  Not the mountain or the wasteland or the empty bowl.  They simply were not there anymore.  There was only the stillness and silence of that water; what a mountain and a wasteland and an empty bowl turned into after the healing began.\\", page 273.  I LOVED this, and I saw it as a metaphor to Cheryl's transformation along the journey, and the transformation she would continue to have in life, as she continued to grow.

B0085A9HXS|1.0|Watched this movie this weekend......I love movies with a collection 800+ films strong.  I cannot see what people see and rave about in this film.<br /><br />It is like the worse Grindhouse martial arts film I have ever seen.....the dubbing is sometime extremely cliched and out of sync (reminds me of the American Pie scene after the first party \\"Their tiger style kung foo is strong, but our dragon style will defeat them, the shaolin masters from east and west must unite... fight... and find out who is number one\\".... with worse then Saturday B film dialogue.<br /><br />The action yes is non stop but over and over and over with no real storyline or plot.<br /><br />And be aware Ultraviolent and bloody here....which I can take (see Hellraiser and Kill Bill series)...but the violence didn't really fit except to string on scene to another to another to another and was there most times to make the movie be sensationalist and bloodier.<br /><br />C'mon this, as some have said, is the best action film ever made?  The best martial arts film.....wow these people must have a very very limited collection!<br /><br />Save your money folks!  I wasted $25 of mine...well at least I can get $5 back from a Best Buy trade in.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|In a post-apocalyptic North America, twenty-four teenagers are chosen annually to participate in the Hunger Games; a winner-take-all event designed to remind the lower classes that the government is still in charge.<br /><br />This year's participants include Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).  Hailing from District 12, Katniss volunteered to take her younger sister's spot in the games.  The rules of the games are simple; two people are chosen from each of twelve districts.  Once transported to the Capitol, the \\"Tributes\\" as they are called are given a trainer to learn from.  Then, the participants are set loose to fight each other to the death.  Only one will survive.<br /><br />Upon arriving at the Capitol, Katniss and Peeta are put under the tutelage of Haymith Abernathy (Woody Harrelson).  Winner of the 50th Hunger Games, Abernathy, now a older (and drunker) former winner, must devise a plan to ensure the survival of one of the tributes from District 12.<br /><br />Things do not go well initially for Katniss, Peeta, and Abernathy, but eventually, the two young tributes begin to trust the former winner.  Eventually, Katniss, Peeta, and the rest of the tributes are released into the wilderness to begin their fight for survival.  Attrition is high and soon, there are only a few tributes left.  To make things even more interesting, it is announced that if two tributes from the same district survive, then they can both be declared winners.  Will Katniss and Peeta survive?<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is a great movie.  The story is very good, and the acting is first-rate.  Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, and Donald Sutherland (President Snow) are all excellent in their roles.<br /><br />I have yet to read the Hunger Games series, but after watching this movie, my interest has definitely risen.  Highly recommended.

1469984202|5.0|This series of books pulled me in and kept me completely engaged from the beginning.  This is the kind of book where you are dying to find out what happens next when you've finished it.  The author did a fantastic job of putting you right there with the characters and as you got through the books, answered all those questions that you were confused about up front.  Well written and such an interesting perspective.  The price for this series of books is INCREDIBLE for the quality of the writing!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased the trilogy - one by one. As soon as I finished the first book.... I needed to get the second.<br />and then the third. Read them all in a week.<br /><br />The trilogy is reminiscent of the reading the the Twilight Series. Could not wait until the next book came out.<br />I am no spring chicken :) but I still enjoyed the read.<br /><br />And for those potential readers... the story is quite sweet... do not let the sex scenes intimidate you like the reviews seem to be trying to do. Although I told my 89 year old mother - I did not think the book was appropriate for<br />her!<br /><br />I am an avid reader - and I like to mix-up my subject matter - anything from Tom Clancy, Nelson DeMille, to even Janet<br />Evanovich - Had not enjoyed a series like this in a very long time.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This season of the popular TV show is by far my favorite season. The interplay between Castle and Beckett is engaging. Ryan and Esposito are in rare form as the backup characters, as are Castle's mother and daughter. It was worthwhile investing in this set, for we love watching them again after watching our first season set.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I went through so many emotions in this book, but every single one completely worth it. i have never been so lost in a book.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Watched on a LG LW6500 passive 3D panel and Pioneer BDP 150 Player.<br /><br />This is the 3D Blu-ray to have, it looks amazing. So much better than it did at the cinema.<br /><br />The movie is absolutely fantastic, so well done that it performed a miracle - created demand for a new Hulk movie. Indeed it's the big green guy and Tony Stark who shine in this film, but all the Avengers get their time in the sun thanks to Joss Whedon's  fanboy dream script, full of his customary intelligence and humour.<br /><br />Visual effects look absolutely stunning on the digital transfer.<br /><br />Only minor carp: Should of been shot in 2.35:1 widescreen!<br /><br />Extras are a bit thin - expect more tricked up editions down the road.<br /><br />A must have.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i really like this app, it tells you exactly how much time you have left to do things such as listen to music or play games, which i find very helpful.it even tells you how long iit will take to charge.. it tells you the health of your battery as well. this is the best battery app out there.
B000GCFX36|2.0|Rachel Walsh's family sends her to what she believes is an exclusive rehabilitation center, but it doesn't turn out to be the vacation she'd dreamed about.<br /><br />I think the most difficult thing about this book was the fact that I didn't care about any of the characters.  Rachel, the drug-addicted twenty-something, was a mess.  I pitied her, but I didn't care about her.  Neither did I bond with any of the other patients in the treatment center.  As  much as Rachel claimed that her boyfriend Luke, was an amazing guy, he seemed very cold emotionally as well as sexually demanding.  Her bff, possibly the only likeable person in the book, showed up rarely.  The nun who was in charge of Rachel's rehabilitation was a bully.  Because I couldn't get close to the characters, reading this was like watching a train wreck.<br /><br />What I did like was the portrayal of Rachel's struggle to come clean.  I also liked how she tackled her denial.<br /><br />Overall, it was kind of meh.

However, I didn't get that from this book; but the book is good, I find myself not able to put it down, look forward everyday to sitting down and finding out what it going on with Christian and Ana.  I'm really excited to read books 2 and 3.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|You may have read this book as a child or maybe somehow it has escaped your notice. In either case read it again or for the first time. The writing and story telling is mesmerizing. The racial ovetones are true to the time. The fence may have been whitewashed but the times were laid bare with honesty and compassion. This is a must read.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|While the book is fiction, Jodi Picoult's book exposes some of the many injustices that gays and lesbians still endure here in the U.S.  In many states, it is still felt that these minorities are unfit to be parents.  Among other outright injustices, in most states, they are not allowed to legally marry the people they love, yet they are expected to continue to  pay taxes just like everyone else in this country.<br /><br />The book is written in the voice of three main characters, which I did not think I would like, but almost immediately appreciated the different perspectives of these characters.  In fact, I've often thought while reading other books about how the other people in the story might be interpreting the different events.  It was like being in the minds of all the main characters and feeling what each of them was feeling.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book to gays and lesbians, and lesbians in particular.  It gives a solid supportive voice to some of the issues confronting them today.

B002361MLA|5.0|For whatever reason, Echhart Tolle got the message and was able to write a book telling the rest of us what he learned.  The concept of the importance of 'now' is not new, yet the down-to-earth way Tolle presents the material makes it easily useable.  To be able to bring yourself back from the future or the past where most of us spend most of our time is monumental to anyone's spiritual growth.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Excellent movie. The actors fit perfect for the theme of the movie and the suspense was good. It has a wonderful message of hope for everyone.
0375507256|5.0|But for a book, it makes one heck of a ride.  Oh My God, was all I could say when I finished the book.  I saw the trailer for the movie, I had never been so moved by such various images, went to my local bookstore, and bought the book.  I read it in four days, which was a record for me.  I laughed, I cried, I read in grand revelry to the beautiful language that was laid out that brough the characters to life so vividly.  I am not usually such a fan to this type of fiction, but, I was drawn to the book, i was drawn to it as if I knew somewhere that what I was going to read was going to touch me in a way that I could never ask for, but that I desperately wanted.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is a beautiful novel, my first, but not my last from David Mitchell, I've already bought his book Ghostwritten and will eventually get the rest of his books as well.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas consists of six stories, which beautifully exist seperate and together in mood and atmospher, the stories aren't really interlinked, but the blood and heart that runs through them, the soul that exist at the beginning, carries its way through the book in a beautiful and powerful portrait of humanity (or mostly humanity).  The first half of the book ends in cliffhangers and takes you from 1850 to a post apocalyptic Hawaii, love it or hate it, you'll admire the attempted scope.  You begin the book with Adam Ewing and you end the book with Adam Ewing, but, Adam Ewing isn't the only story you're going to here.  On a fateful trip across the Pacific, the title of the chapter is The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing.  You are then introduced to another character Robert Froshiber, who discovers the journal we are just reading on a shelf, here's story told in epistolary format, is intriguing.<br /><br />As we move to the next character Luisa Rey, we get a tale of corruption in a Nuclear power plant, mystery, desperate, each story lingers for want and truth, and travels to the heart of everything, the want of each character.<br /><br />We then have the story of Timothy Cavendish, a publisher, comic, and clear, we are connected to the previous story as he receives it as a manuscript for a novel.<br /><br />We're then moved to a future in Korea, where corporations created clones for human use.  This story of a rebel told in an interview is interesting and intriguing as she's about to be led to execution for her attempted rebellion.<br /><br />Then finally, the story goes to the post apocalyptic Hawaii, told as if narrated by a story teller around a fire.<br /><br />Each story is brilliant, each story is packed with emotion, reverence, and power.  David Mitchell created a masterpiece with this work and it deserves its reverence and claim.  Will it make a good movie?  Only time will tell.  Is the book a grand and illustrious work of fiction, you bet your bottom dollar it is.<br /><br />Clarence Oliver Author Of The Three Diets Solution and The Path To Mindful Eatingharacter.<br /><br />We then have the story of Timothy Cavendish, a publisher, comic, and clear, we are connected to the previous story as he receives it as a manuscript for a novel.<br /><br />We're then moved to a future in Korea, where corporations created clones for human use.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read all three of the fifty shades series and am still kicking myself for seeing it through.  I think I read a third of the last book just to get to the end.  The writing is at the young adult level and after reading one or two of the sex scenes it becomes very yada, yada, yada turn the page.  The hype on this book is so pervasive that I just had to see what it was all about.  I'm kicking myself for being fifty shades of stupid for making the author and publisher rich!

B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really good app.  It is also very nice on the Kindle Fire.  I say get this app it is very nice.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|You can use the sound mixes that come with the app, use individual sounds, make your own mixes with varying the volumes of each sound you choose, and save those mixes.  If you don't like the preprogrammed mixes you can delete them.  You can also set a timer for preset or custom lengths, and tell it to turn the app off after the timer runs out or to keep it open so you can easily get it going again if you wake up or are using it to relax and want some more time with it.  Even the interface and the graphics are nice.  It's incredible to me they don't even charge for this.  The sounds are nicely varied and pretty realistic.  For instance, my cats get really confused when I use the purring cat sound (much to my amusement).<br /><br />For those who say they can't use the app and do anything else at the same time on the device it's installed on, try hitting the device's back button.  I use it on my mobile (Samsung Galaxy Exhibit II), where if I hit the back button, not the home button, the app still runs in the background while I do something else such as read or surf the web; hitting the home button kills it.<br /><br />I have not yet used the theta waves feature, as I'm a chronic migraineur and am leery of poking at my brain very much (I'm that 1 person in 1,000,000 w the poor reactions you read about in inserts).  But the regular sounds that come with the free version of the app are pleasant and varied enough that turning it on after a long day has yet to fail lulling me right to sleep, faster than sleeping meds I've taken in the past and without producing that gross drug hangover the next day.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this app to those who have tinnitus or other difficulties getting to sleep.  It may not keep you asleep but I'd be surprised if you couldn't put together a mix that enables you to get to sleep easier.
1475143389|5.0|First off this book is awesome. Yes you could find this information on the internet, however it would probably take you ages, and you might not be able to make sense of it all.<br /><br />Everything Mike suggests in this book in solid, however, I did have areas I wish where covered in more detail...<br /><br />1- 6 square meals a day.... Why? Also this in no way helps you burn more calories. No mention of intermittent fasting<br /><br />2- The macro nutrient calculation don't take into account your bodyfat do you really need 1.5 grams of protein for that excess 30 pounds of fat you're carrying?<br />or just lean body mass? No mention of bodyfat in his equation.<br /><br />3-  The fat in the macro nutrient calculations seems waaaaay low. I read somewhere (not an expert) that you need 0.3 - 0.5 grams per pound to regulate hormones & such.<br /><br />Also for those of you who are wondering, yes this book assumes YOU WILL COUNT CALORIES. Which can be a big turnoff for some less ambition folks.<br /><br />That said I love this book, it's awesome and if you follow everything in here they're is simply no way you won't get in great shape.

I have never encountered a character in literature quite like Ignatius Reilly, the protagonist, and his personality resonates shockingly well in 2012, many years after publication.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins is a champion for education and reason, and with the writing of this book, has become one of my heroes.  This book is a wonderful tool to help clarify ideas that I think many of us have already had but were unable to put into words and arguments that were so well reasoned and eloquent.  I have been out of college for about ten years now and will admit, I had my smart phone on standby in order to look up definitions of a few of the terms relating to philosophy or to Google some of the other historic references.  That brings up another point, this book opens a doorway into a world of other ideas and areas that you may wish to research further.<br />This book gets 5 stars with no reservation.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|The game is fun it and reminds of monster rancher and pokemon in some ways. I'm not a huge fan of facebook style sit and wait social games, but monster life is good to pass those few extra minutes. If you enjoy taking care of virtual pets, having monster fights, and decorating landscapes this is a game for you.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|The movie was consistent with the Roman Empire, its senators, its caste system between the soldiers, pheasants, the powers of Rome.  The clothing were authentic for that era.  The government system was accurate, the type of food and beverage, and the diet between the poor and the rich.  They had good actors and actress, especially the character of Mark Anthony, the mother of Brutus, and the mother of Octavia.  The Rise and Fall of Rome was accurate.  Too bad they did not continue with the series.
0439023513|2.0|The Hunger Games was phenomenal. Catching Fire did the impossible; it surpassed it's predecessor. So you can only imagine what high expectations I had of Mockingjay prior to reading it. I was deluded into thinking it would be as fantastic as the others. I was extremely disappointed and frankly, quite upset, that this was NOT the case. At all. Coming from a talented writer who has done amazing things with words and created unique, engrossing plots, Mockingjay was appalling. It didn't feel like reading for enjoyment; it felt like a chore.<br /><br />First off, Katniss. I don't even have words to describe how disappointed and disbelieving I am at what this strong, intelligent, resourceful, cunning, kick-butt protagonist has now become. In Mockingjay, she is an empty shell, a pawn for the rebels to use for their own objectives. She is diminished to an angsty, whiny, selfish brat who can do nothing but constantly bemoan her own fate. 90% of the book, she is a drugged up shadow; always wandering aimlessly through the hallways or throwing pity parties for herself in the closet. As the war unraveled, I felt like Katniss was always on the sidelines, only called in when other people commanded her to. We didn't get to see Katniss kicking butt against her enemies, we got to hear from other characters about events that occurred, or watch them on the TV. I kept waiting, sure this was all build-up for that moment when Collins would throw in the story changer. Sure that any minute Katniss would pick herself up and say \\"Enough is enough\\". I kept waiting for the moment when the winds would change and she would decide with conviction to actively work through her problems- but to my shock, that moment never came.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next biggest problem with the book: it was so anti-climatic! In the rare case we were ever given an exciting scene, as soon as it got intense, Katniss would get knocked out in the midst of things and we would wake up to her in the hospital being treated. The book was mindnumbingly dull; there was absolutely no excitement. I felt no emotion at all when the rebels triumphed; no relief, no joy. Because we were not there with them, amid all the action. We were stuck with dull Katniss, watching the events unfold from the sidelines. It was INFURIATING! Katniss did nothing to help defeat the Capitol; she basically watched Prim die, got burned, and woke up in a hospital, where she (and us) were TOLD instead of SHOWN how the Capitol fell. I also couldn't believe Katniss's trial just happened without us. Katniss is moping and plotting her suicide in her room in the Capitol (as usual), and then one day Haymitch wanders in and says, \\"Your trial's over. You're free.\\" Honestly, I don't give a flying fart about Katniss' countless issues; give me some action!!<br /><br />WHAT IS WITH THE POINTLESS DEATHS??!! Deaths that don't ensure anyone else's survival, are excessively undignified, or never grieved for. Mockingjay was full of them. Finnick, Mesalla, itchell, Boggs, Cinna, need I say more? They are all ridiculous, gory, bloody and did NOTHING to aid Katniss bringing down the capitol. Essentially, they are all just deaths for the sake of death. Collins just randomly and meaninglessly killed off all the supporting characters to build excitement, because she couldn't bear to part with the main ones. Prim's death didn't have the impact Collins was aiming for; it felt like a strangers death. I didn't get to know or connect with Prim well enough throughout the three books to feel any emotion besides pity for Katniss. And she was absent for at least 100 pages before her death came out of nowhere, so I was too confused to feel any sadness. (Although it seems her death kind of defeated the point of sparing her from the Hunger Games.) On the other hand, I was extremely distraught over Finnick's death. He had just married the love of his life and she was pregnant, for god's sake! But I understand why Collins killed him off. I would even be okay with it (upset, but fine with it) if she had made his death a little classier. Or, A LOT classier. His death is absolutely nonsensical. I mean, eaten by mutts in a sewer? So unnecessesary.<br /><br />And finally, Gale. What happened to him? Oh, he's in District 2. And what's he doing in Distict 2? Dunno. How did he get there? Dunno. Why did he go there? Dunno. How does he feel about Katniss being with Peeta out of default, not either one's choice? Dunno. What's he going to do with his life now? Where is he going to live? What's going to happen to this character that we've been with for almost three whole books, and who's played a huge part in the story of Katniss's life? Uh...I dunno. I was team Gale all along, so I admit I may be a bit biased on this front, but I do feel like the conclusion of the love triangle was very rushed. Like Collins had no idea what to do with it, so she sent one off and left it at that. But Gale fit with Katniss so well. He was like the peanut butter to her jelly. Why did you do this to me, Suzanne Collins??
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app. It is up todate and for me spot on. Works well and rader is great.
014241543X|2.0|The writing is mediocre, at best. It's not the grammar and simplicity that makes me regard it with such distaste, but rather the unnecessary tedious paragraphs which drag on and on. There were so many parts which just didn't fit into the story and were not needed to complete the plot. This novel is rather short, but it still could have been told in half the amount of words. Other than that, it was fairly well-written. There were quite a few promising paragraphs.<br /><br />The plot. I understand the idea behind the plot. There was a message portrayed through the story; there is always something worth living for. But the way the message was shown to us was so boring that it ruined the meaning of the story for me. The switching between past and present? I hated it. It was confusing and many of the \\"past\\" scenes left me disoriented and unsure of how they tied into the (nonexistent) plot. Other than the meaningless \\"past\\" scenes, we are left with the ghost of Mia mourning over her loss and debating her decision in the hospital. That's pretty much it. Mia walks around the hospital, randomly thinks about her past (cue flashback), we return the the present and Mia wakes up. The end.<br /><br />The characters were so flat. There was not a single character that I felt for in this book. NOT ONE. Because we were never introduced to the characters, there was no development. Even when Mia was experiencing an emotional crisis, I did not give a flying fart. It was as if a stranger was breaking down in front of me. I feel bad for them, but I'm not feeling my heart wrenched out with them. Which is why I did not shed a single tear at the end of the book. I was calm, composed and a little disbelieving that the story just ended so abruptly.<br /><br />The pacing was all wrong. Well... there wasn't really any pacing. Because there was no excitement or emotion to keep you going. It was as if the whole book was an introduction... I was skimming at the beginning, anxious to get to the climax. But the climax never came, and before I knew it, I had finished the book.<br /><br />I know other love it (hey, you might too) but I really didn't like it. It was a bore and frankly, a chore to get through.
0060873027|5.0|I was elated to find still another book by Michael Crichton.  The price was good and the quality of the book was excellent.  I am so happy with this deal!
1416955070|5.0|There is a lot of controversy surrounding this book; everyone either loves it or hates it. I absolutely adore it. I think it's very unique, phenomenally written and just a fantastic story all around. This book introduced me to Cassandra Clare's writing and I have been a huge fan ever since. She has a way of writing that draws you in from the start; it's beautiful, hilarious and emotional all together. I am always shaken up after reading any of her books, and City of Bones was no exception.<br /><br />I love the characters in this book. Clary, the protagonist is strong, sarcastic and very loyal. She is the perfect protagonist for the story and Cassandra does an amazing job of introducing Clary to us throughout the book. I am able to connect to her on a new level. She is very relatable and impossible not to love. I have also fallen in love with Clary's love interest: Jace. Jace is my version of the ideal boyfriend. He is a lot of fun to be around, he is loyal to his friends and family, he is hilarious and he is so sweet and caring. He and Clary go together perfectly. There is a bit of a love triangle going on here with Simon, but there aren't any hard feelings and Cassandra comes up with the perfect solution in future books (take note Stephenie Meyer and Suzanne Collins!).<br /><br />The plot may not be unique, but the world Cassandra created absolutely is. I have never read anything like it before and I long to be a part of it. I haven't felt this way since reading Harry Potter; I want to be there with the characters. I feel like I AM there with the characters. I was immersed in this world where demons roam the night, weres run a bar, vamps occupy abandoned hotels, warlocks cast spells while ricking glitter in their hip hugging jeans, and the law is upheld by Shadowhunters, a race of humans blessed by the angel Raziel. WOW! The plot draws you in and the story is full of action. Yes, there are some cliches, but who cares? The story is dramatic, interesting and perfectly paced. THIS is what I call a paranormal romance. Someone finally got it right.<br /><br />The characters touched my heart, the plot drew me in, the writing left me in an emotional wreck. Cassandra Clare created a spectacular book that touched on all elements of the perfect novel, and completely surpassed my expectations. This is a fantastic read and I would recommend it to everyone, no matter what gender, what age, what genre preference. 5/5!

B0084IG8TM|5.0|First of all, I have seen quite a few movie adaptations in my 66 years.  I usually try to not read the book before watching the movie, because it is impossible to perfectly capture the essence of the book.  This one is an exception. Outstanding!<br /><br />In this case, I read the entire HG Trilogy on my Kindle  and then HAD to see the movie!  They captured the essentials of the book brilliantly.  If anything, the emotions are portrayed better than the written word can do.<br /><br />In a two hour movie, a lot of the  scene development has to rely on implications.  Also, scenes have to be left out or curtailed. I think that they did a good job on this and also stayed true to the original story line.<br /><br />The best part of the book and the movie is that even though This is a science fiction story, the characters are very human and the story is very believable.  The \\"world\\" of the story is where the science fiction comes into play.  No genetically modified superheroes, although there are genetically modified creatures.<br /><br />Many reviewers think that they have to be \\"critics\\".  Also many professional movie critics think they have to be \\"critical\\".  I think those misconceptions are the source of many of the negative reviews.  This is a great movie and does not deserve the negative reviews I have read, in my opinion.<br /><br />If you watch the movie, pay attention to the song that is played over the credits at the end!  Does the tune sound familiar?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome book!!! I can`t imagine anyone not falling in love with the Hunger Games. I found myself yelling &#34;kiss, kiss!!&#34; at the book. Although I did not enjoy the ending where everythin is tied up in a nice little bow, the rest of the story makes up for that. Literally changed how I see life. Amazing.
B000PAAH3K|1.0|Had to pick this up for a class, and as with most examples of Gladwell's work, all you get are sloppy examples that may  or may not loosely apply to the word he has chosen for a title. All he does is provide shaky examples of what he want's to \\"prove\\" without giving any kind of nod to a counter example. To make matters worse the topic of the book is a dangerous one for people who believe that Malcom Gladwell has anything good to say. Please, for the sake of mankind do not read this book.

1451627297|3.0|If there's one thing you can be certain about when delving into a long Stephen King novel is that the ending that it is set up to have will not come to past. That's fine, in fact, it's good writing. But King crosses the line over and over again by grabbing the reader and pulling them along forever and a day through a long and complex emotional journey then just when you think it's over, he smashes your face into the rocks and leaves you bleeding \\"that's what you get.\\"<br /><br />The basic set-up is this, there's a door back to 1958, every time you go into that door it's the same moment so everything is as if nothing happened before, unless, you never go back. For Jake Epping there's a mission here, given to him by a dying acquaintance who happens to own the door, go back, wait five years, save JFK, save the world.<br /><br />There's a few minor things first, one is to save a girl from getting shot and paralyzed, the other to save an entire family from murder by hammer at the hands of the father. Since Jake's got 5 years to kill, he attempts those things before moving on to Texas.<br /><br />There he takes up as a school teacher. I'm a little fuzzy about betting practices, but for money he keeps going to bookies with info on long shots. It seems like finding bookies is hard as hell and rather than taking a book on sports stats from '55 - '65 he takes handwritten notes? Also, no track betting, quick, easy, anonymous? He also takes a job teaching, gets involved with the locals, falls in love with a librarian and stakes out Lee Oswald.<br /><br />There's plenty going on. King drops all the usual hints that nothing is as it seems, the \\"butterfly effect\\" is mentioned over and again and several possible endings, none of which come to pass... entirely... are set up. In fact, by the end of the book you might just toss it at a wall and curse KIng (see also, IT, The Stand & 4000 pages of The Dark Tower)<br /><br />The books gets off to a fast but rough start. You don't know the character and there's little set-up and Jake getting adjusted into 1958 gets a little boring. The sub-plots for saving the paralyzed girl and murdered family become the best parts of the book. However, he's got to go save JFK and that's not exciting at all.<br /><br />Once Jake is in Texas (notice how Texas is Taxes spelled wrong?) he stakes out Oswald to assure himself he's the killer (going on the notion he might just kill Oswald way ahead of 11/22/63)and this is just not Kings strong point. He's trying to write a suspense, crime-drama, thriller but he's got nothing. Oswald's a boring man with a boring life and it's boring for hundreds of pages to have the protagonist stalk him. You could literally just cut 200 pages and never miss them. King tries to make the Oswalds characters, tries to make them interesting but they don't do anything and Jake has the under constant surveillance but nothing remotely intriguing comes of it.<br /><br />The book really becomes the star-crossed lover story of Jake and Sadie Dunhill. There's a subplot about her crazy ex coming to try and kill her and her figuring out the truth about Jake and the idea that he saves Kennedy and they step into the bright future and live happily ever after. But, this is Kings world, so we know going it that aint gonna happen.<br /><br />:::::::::::::::::::::::SPOILERS AHEAD:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br /><br />So Jake and his love fight time to stop Oswald. Of course they do, and Sadie gets shot and jake is a hero and he must return to 2011 eleven alone, wondering if he can re-live those 5 years again to save her. But the future is ruined. Changing history, not Kennedy himself, has brought destruction on the planet, in fact, in 60 - 70 years it's going to simply break apart and be no more. So everything Jake has done, all of it, for nothing. You just spent 600+ pages reading about something that never happens in it's own story.<br /><br />That's the frustration of King.<br /><br />I didn't expect JFK to live, or Sadie to have a perfect face after she's cut in '63, but I was hoping he'd find a way to give the reader something more than the books real title \\"Jake Epping looses 5 years of his life\\" I think at the very least Jake stays in past with Sadie or brings her into the present. None of the minor changes to ordinary people seemed to affect much and it would have been an interesting epilog to<br /><br />It's hard to recommend a book who's ending is basically \\"and then he woke up and none of it had every happened\\" Yeah, King has the courage to write the downer ending, but can he write a somewhat not miserable one? Maybe, but I doubt it.K to live, or Sadie to have a perfect face after she's cut in '63, but I was hoping he'd find a way to give the reader something more than the books real title \\"Jake Epping looses 5 years of his life\\" I think at the very least Jake stays in past with Sadie or brings her into the present.

B002IKLZZY|5.0|Hitchcock's suspenseful mistaken-identity classic remains daring, original and vibrant enough to hang with the big boys of the modern age. Cary Grant may have been a few years too old for this leading role, but the fast-paced, ever-intensifying script that envelopes him never gives us the chance to sit and stew on it. The concept that powers the whole bag is astonishingly simple, and once it's knocked out of the way in the first act, the picture is then perfectly happy to gradually up the stakes and riff on the premise for the rest of its allotted time. It's a testament to the creativity of the filmmakers that it still feels so fresh and untainted today, in the era of the derivative knock-off, with only a few dated automobiles and touches of public etiquette reminding us it's actually closing in on sixty years of age. Classic, timeless action / adventure / suspense.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|its cool, I like that it tells battery durations for fucnctions.  the calibration program I think is total BS.  besides that its fine.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator is a must have app for anyone with kindle. top notch app for FREE! very fast very reliable big numbers
B00003CXAT|4.0|The T-rex was scary, to be sure; however, the velociraptors are terrifying creatures, and much smaller! Scientific discoveries present exciting opportunities; however, just because something CAN be done, that does not mean that it SHOULD be done. Case in point. Events escalate and spiral out of control. Disaster looms around every corner. Exciting film.

B008AYCSE4|4.0|This is an artsy adult film about a socially inept man addicted to porn, particularly Internet porn. His NY apartment is furnished a bit Spartan. His boring life is interrupted when his sister, Carey Mulligan comes to stay. There is an awkward scene where he stares at her naked body while she showers. It is designed to show how dysfunctional and creepy Brandon has become in life, like the long drawn out subway scene. His sister is in a bad relationship and is as dysfunctional as Brandon. She is a nightclub singer. The suicidal Carey is desperate for intimacy as is hinted in so many scenes.<br /><br />Brandon's dysfunction is apparently from living a semi-isolated life on a computer. His obsession with casual sex, porn, and masturbation causes problems in his life which escalates as the film progresses. Brandon realizes he has issues and takes steps to resolve those issues, but has trouble moving forward toward a normal sexual relationship that involves intimacy and only compounds things.<br /><br />Fassbender and McQueen do an excellent job in capturing the character of Brandon as we see his despair, grief, and isolation. This is the type of film in which I had to watch the whole thing to decide if I liked it or not depending on the ending. After seeing the ending, I am still not sure, which is why I have opted to sit on the fence post at 3 stars. Oh wait! I will add a star for nudity...but I'm not a pervert.<br /><br />F-bomb sex, nudity and some full frontal nudity (Michael Fassbender, Carey Mulligan, Mari-Ange Ramirez (first prostitute?),Nicole Beharie, Elizabeth Masucci, Hannah Ware (Internet girl?) DeeDee Luxe, Calamity Chang)
B006LSZECO|3.0|....because it wasn't the same person that wrote the first 75%, which was absolutely brilliant.  As other reviewers have mentioned - and I'm piling on - the ending was not nearly as clever as the rest of the book and left me very disappointed.  I'm going to give it 3 Stars, and pretend I didn't read the last several chapters.<br /><br />The writing, character development, imagery, tension, and pit-in-stomach feeling was fantastic through the first 75%.  If you are an inspiring writer, I highly recommend you grab a box of highlighters, a box of pens, some notebook paper and read this book, so that you know how to capture these elements in a story.  Don't forget to read the last 25% because there are lessons there as well, such as having the ending figured out, before you reach a \\"no turning back\\" point, which Flynn clearly hit.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I struggled through the first half. It just seemed to drag on and on. Second half became very interesting and I was excited to read it. And then...the end. What was that?!?! SO sad that I wasted money on this book.
B0026S1XDM|4.0|I'm not sure I particularly liked the 2009 remix. I'm almost positive it's mainly because my ears are *SO* used to the original mix. It's the one I've been playing nearly non-stop since I discovered it, so to suddenly hear additional/ new instrumentation in the mix with the original, it just didn't sit right to my mind & ears. The additions sounded out of place. You could tell right away where 1973 ended & 2009 began.<br /><br />I guess I was under the impression that the 2009 version would be a *remastering*. Not an actual remix. I must've overlooked that in reviews.<br /><br />However, I'm also assuming the inclusion of the original 1973 mix *is* touched up aurally & sounds great to my ears. I don't (yet) own any sound equipment that's optimal for 5.1 Surround sound, but I can only assume it sounds incredible.<br /><br />I was truly in this for the dvd though. I saw some of this live performance on Youtube & was floored. I knew I had to own it. Worth getting for the dvd alone, IMO.
B000002J6F|1.0|The CD sounds OK.  The insert quality is awful and there is no listing of songwriter credits.  It is not worth the money overall.

B007WA56SC|4.0|I thought with K25 and Kylie's big 25th Anniversary, that this would have some cool new re-interpreted versions of some great hits, but nope! It's just another greatest Hits Compilation. Not much added since Ultimate Kylie, and the only reason to have it is for the DVD, IMHO! However, it's a great item for an intro to Kylie or for a Completist's Collection.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|this brilliant app is crazy good.  First and foremost it's free and secondly almost never lets me down, but that's besides the point.  Terrific app to have on the to, because where you go so does the dictioario.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Hi...I've got this blu-ray last week, everything is okay, except for the digital copy which is not good. I did apply on the web but I assume it's not working here in south america (OFF AMERICA). So far I'm not able to watch a few 3D bluray movies in my home theater. Let's see, I got a 3D bluray player (Samsung BDD6500), the 3D bluray movie and a BenQ projector MW512(which is 3D READY). In fact, the issue is the projector, I don't think is 3D ready...any thoughts about this \\"little\\" problem I'll appreciate it!!!
B007MU85D0|5.0|This has become one of my favorite albums. Since purchasing it I have listened to it in its entirety at least once, and sometimes a few times, every week. It was also a great price, so I definitely got my money's worth.
B001DTTG16|5.0|One of the most entertaining films of our time; or was it a previous time? Hard to say because, remained current. The music and the dancing is fun and reminiscent of the 1980's and sentimentally rich in story line. I highly recommend it to those who have seen once before as well as the younger generations.<br />SMS
B004D38HOG|5.0|This book was incredible to read that someone was as Portia was but makes you realise what people put themselves through to look like they think they should... so pleased her life turned out as it has in the end and loved some of her thoughts in the end.
006197806X|3.0|Delirium had a great premise and was ably supported by the execution. Pandemonium, in my opinion, was much weaker. I felt that narrative structure greatly diminished the impact of the book and the big plot twist at the end had me rolling my eyes. It was worth a read but was  disappointing overall. The series compares favorably with the other dystopian/fantasy ya novels on the market but Pandemonium failed to live up to the promise of Delirium.
B005K17RU0|5.0|seems like it does everything that you would expect a weather app to do.  easy interface and pretty good visuals.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Rothfuss is an incredible writer, and his first book, The Name of the Wind, was one of the best-written books I've read in a long while.<br /><br />His follow-up is very strong, but it suffers from some pacing issues that the first book did not.  The first and last thirds of the book are phenomenal, but I did experience the desire to skip chapters in the middle third.  I will avoid spoilers, but I will say that I am extremely happy with the book overall, and I will be looking forward to the end of Kvothe's story.
B000002KEV|5.0|This is the best production of the band in a live concert. They did a lot of live concerts during those years but it was terrific and fantastic because they show all of best they had playing music .
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I have been reading this series since 1997, and it almost pains me to say that this book is not worthy of the first three.<br /><br />The fourth book, Feast for Crows, received a good review from me based on the assumption that Martin would follow his original plan and focus on the characters we care most about in Dance.<br /><br />He betrayed that idea.  Dance only follows Dany and Jon for a limited amount of time, and it introduces several characters that no one cares about because we don't know them.  The book was a waste of time and money, and it may have kept me from finishing the series.<br /><br />Martin is receiving undeserved rave reviews for this book from critics based on the fact that he has a television show.  Anyone who has been reading Martin for a while knows that this book is a colossal failure compared to his previous work.  If you are not hell-bent on finishing this series, leave it alone.
0955153077|1.0|This book is NOT a beginners painting book.  It is not really even a how to paint book.  (there are a few good things though, but the principal author should be fired)<br /><br />Indeed it says a few beginner things, like how to set up a scratch disk,<br /><br />but the articles vary from worthless garbage to a little bit not too bad.<br /><br />take the first project for ex:<br />we start with a sketch which 'one should do'<br />but the sketch is like a photograph, with NO indication of how it was achieved other than 'use a few brushes'...<br /><br />in addition, most of the examples are Sci Fi junk (to me); think about 'how to do a terminator like scary city'.  This is not bad for those who want to do such, but to have most, not all to be fair,  of the book about that stinks.<br /><br />I truly regret buying this book.<br /><br />Scott
0307387178|4.0|I took this to read on the planes this last weekend.  It was really good.  after reading that first part on the first page I actually gasped and my stomache clenched up. by the end of my trip I had 3 people saying they were going to buy this when they got home.  Very interesting book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is one of those stories that sits with you long after you finish reading. I'm glad a I came late to the party and actually got to read this all in one sitting (practically) because I would have been going nuts waiting to find out what happened next. That's not to say I'm not looking forward to more, but the story does end really well, with enough closure to be satisfying, but enough intrigue to want to read more. Hugh Howey created such an amazing world with characters I immediately felt for, that I was hooked after just a few pages. This is right up there with my favorite books of the year. Thanks Hugh. And thanks for showing the world you don't have to be published by the big six publishers to create fabulous stories. Keep up the great work!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Honestly, there's nothing wrong with the story. But if everyone \\"murmured\\" as much as they do in these books in real life, no one would be able to hear anything anyone was saying. Also, throughout the books everyone has \\"lips pressed into a straight line\\", everyone is \\"smirking\\", and honestly as far as the dialogue, no one talks like that.<br /><br />HOWEVER, in spite of all that the character of Christian Grey is amazing. He's what kept me reading. This is my favorite book out of the three.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a great book - each chapter was a different characters point of view. It kept me guessing until the very end!
B0084IG8TM|4.0|A friend got this dvd for me.  I was kinda prepared to dislike it for all the crazed media attention but, now I guess that makes sense since the books were hugely popular.  Jennifer Lawrence is a skilled actress.  If you haven't already, you must see \\"Winter's Bone\\".  She is very very good.  I enjoyed Woody Harralson in this role.  I had not envisioned Haymitch this way, which is good.  Woody brought something different for me.  The movie did a very good job within its time limit and the portrayals were right on.  This is a fable truly for our time:  it lets you get a good luck at what can happen when the 1% are unbridled.  Did you already understand that?  This a myth to be heeded.
B008C0C1Y8|4.0|Saw this when it came out in 95-thought it was ahead of It's time,this along with the crow was the beginning of more serious darker comic book characters.<br />The production boasts great looking sets and visuals,one of the first to give a photo realistic inviroment against the usual over designed look of other comic book movies.<br />If you want great action and some cool futuristic violence-this is the one-one of Alan Silvestri's best scores as well.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|What a concept!  Would u do a drug that made you use your whole brain instead of the tiny portion you actually use?  The action is fast-paced because the thinking is fast-paced!  I disagree with review that said it slowed or got murky in latter part.  The movie goes up and down, fast and slow, which matches the experience of the drug.  When it seems withdrawal may become a problem, the action/plot becomes frantic.  The action truly does follow the drug experience and Bradley Cooper does it well, alternating between peppy and brilliant, and messy, slow and confused.  He portrays a good \\"junkie\\" even SPOILER ALERT going so far as to lap the blood of a another guy doing the drug, when he is desperate for a plan to get out of trouble.  Think fast! Get a plan!  Drop a pill!  I'm sure Big Pharma has been workin' on it for a while now, and it will cost!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I'm very happy with this mic.  The cable is very long, which is great to plug directly into a video camera. However, using it with a wireless setup will cause you to shove a bunch of cable in your pocket.  There is no battery indicator, so keep extra batteries on hand.  Good quality sound for a pro-sumer style unit.  I'm happy with this purchase and may purchase another.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|If you watched season one and two of The Game of Thrones on HBO and are up in the air about actually reading the books, don't wait.  They're well worth it.<br />There's much more detail than the HBO series could go into and I was totally engrossed even though I had watched the series first.  I just ordered Book 3 and plan to read it before season 3 starts.  Thanks George R. R. Martin.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I was iffy about getting this game. But after playing the first 5 waves i am starting to enjoy it. I have to admit though I enjoy the Pochinko mini game a little bit more. Still, this is a decent time killer, worth checking out.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I loved his Glam Nation album, and his Glam Nation Live album even better.  It really made his music come alive with monumental improvisation of the music which offers the listener an even more awesome view of his magnificent talent in the setting he is most adept...theater, and operatic training. He uses it in such artistic fashion with the Glam Nation Live album and video.  It is a plus, so please make a concerted effort and give it a listen.  It's amazing.  Trespassing is his third greatest achievement.  He dares to not put himself in a box, but give us music that he loves this time, and that's dance club music.  It is a fabulous album. It has also garnered stellar reviews. There weren't too many negatives with this album. The first time I heard it, I really thought Wow this is good.  Yes, it is a little adult in nature, but it is mild considering how many pop artists nowadays have so many explicit lyrics you can't even listen to it.  Adam's dance songs are great, and the ballads are very moving.  He does not disappoint us vocally and uses great prowess chilling us to the bone.  There's not a song that I don't love.  Please check out his Trespassing promo tour concerts for Trespassing on You Tube.  For the most part, they have been pretty conservative.  All his shows are.  The new Trespassing music comes to life with less techno, and more jazzy, blues soul music.  It's different then the album. It has even more personality, and really delivers, with some new people in the band, and back up singers that are great fun giving it a more family feel.  It's intimate, garnering a club setting with acoustic numbers that let his voice really shine.  It's more of the Adam we love to hear...front and center.  So, with Trespassing we're dancing, and having a great time.  We're sharing some passionate music from his soul, which will open your heart and let you feel.  He's a person first and most importantly a child of God too.  Don't be surprised if the next album is something that a lot of people have expressed they would love to hear from him, and that's a more classical pop feel.  He's trained classically, and you can just fall in love with him all over again.  I'm looking forward to that myself.  He says he doesn't want to stay in any one genre.  Classical pop...is just the icing on his cake.  So, pick up Trespassing, listen to what he has to say, and think about it too. Have fun dancing and even exercising to it.  It doesn't disappoint.
B005LAIH9K|4.0|American Reunion is basically a chance for all those in their late 20s and early 30s to think back to their high school days. It brought in all the characters from the original, but not in a forced way. Some obvious flaws (who celebrates their 13th reunion), but definitely a must see for those who grew up with these characters from the American Pie series.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Terrence Malick crafts another stunning masterpiece in `The Tree of Life', a film that follows the journey of a boy growing up with a strict father and loving mother and finds himself conflicted between the two.<br /><br />If you've seen `The Thin Red Line', then you'll probably be familiar with Malick's shooting style. It's a very artsy movie, with lots of lingering shots of people staring into nowhere, hand-held abstract close-ups, voice-overs asking philosophical questions over shots of space and opera scores, it's beautifully filmed and very close and intimate with the actors and the way everything relates back to the conflict of nature and grace, the sort of overall theme in this movie, makes it a really powerful movie to sit through.<br /><br />Acting is tops, but with this cast, how can you expect anything less? Brad Pitt was brilliant as the authoritarian father and a contrast to Jessica Chastain's affectionate mother, who absolutely shines in the role. Hunter McCracken almost steals the movie as the emotionally conflicted Jack O'Brien.<br /><br />With it's slower pace and contemplative tone, this is a movie that needs a chance to grow on you. It's really not the type of movie where you go in and expect the usual structure of a movie. You have to keep an open-mind and let it take you on its' ride and it becomes an engaging and thought-provoking experience, especially after the credits roll and you begin to mull things over.<br /><br />The disc includes `Exploring The Tree of Life', a quite interesting thirty minute documentary with interviews with the cast and crew, sans Terrence Malick of course, about the making of the film and a lot about working with Malick's open shooting style, Christopher Nolan and David Fincher are in it expressing their admiration for Malick's work.

0345803485|5.0|I am not much of a reader, hardly ever read....but all the talk about these books I wanted to see what it was all about.  The first book was alright, the second book was better and the third book was very, very interesting.  I hope book four will be even better than three.  Not at all what I expected, so many people talked about the hot and juicey sex parts, I think it was maybe \\"R\\" rated, nothing like porn as people speak of.  The third book is fantastic but you need to read the first two in order to know what is going on in the third one, but the third one makes the series worth buying.

1401232590|5.0|The Long Halloween is sort of a psuedo sequel to [[ASIN:0930289331 Batman: Year One]] by Frank Miller.  Jeph Loeb wrote this murder mystery about a serial killer who kills on holidays starting on Halloween and it features appearances from Riddler, Joker, Scarecrow, Poisen Ivy, the Mad Hatter, and Catwoman.  He apparently has it in for one of the major crime families in Gotham and it has Gotham's underworld in an uproar.  What makes this story so famous is that it chronicles the transformation of Harvey Dent into Two Face and was a big inspiration for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.  You'll see allot of elements that carried over to the films, and as great as those movies are this story really takes the cake.  Batman does some actual detective work and the mystery is genuine and keeps you on your toes.  In addition to the 13 issues contained in this collection, you'll also find sketches and notes on the different covers as well as an introdcution by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer. [[ASIN:1563898683 Batman: Dark Victory]] is a direct sequel to this story.  If you're new to Batman comics, I recommend reading Batman:  Year One, followed by Batman:  The Long Halloween, and Batman:  Dark Victory.  It makes a great read as a trilogy of sorts.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The reading becomes more and more repetitive while the pages passed by; the book's plot line is unbound as you expected and there is not much emotion in despite of sex. There is a dull moment when you just turn the page wanting finally to get to the end of the story.
B007SGM084|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy....<br />Best read altogether. You don't really get the full effect with the first book, but I do have to say riding crops sounds fun. These books are about people learning how to love themselves and each other.
B00136NYR6|5.0|I played the heck out of this album as a college student, and even then it was already 20 years old. There is no way to overstate how important this album is as a cultural artifact and a landmark achievement for our greatest songwriter, and much has been written to remind us how and why this album is so important. But anyone who's listened to it also knows how much fun it is to listen to; there is a delightfully liquid bluesy feel to the songs that keeps the music squarely in a biker bar, even if the lyrics belong in a literary anthology. If you've heard \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" too many times on the classic rock station and you find \\"Highway 61\\" a little gimmicky and quirky, you owe it to yourself to explore the other great songs on the record. They swing and rock you along and provide the perfect counterpoint to Dylan's extraordinary lyrics. The blues never sounded so smart.
B00005LELD|5.0|Nikon got this one right. I looked for a hard/metal hood for my 50/1.8 (such as the HN-31 for the 85mm 1.4). This was what Nikon recommended. They were right on. It is a screw in hood, but made of a sturdy collapsible rubber. Works like a charm, and travels well with hood collapsed and lens cover in place. Love it!!! . . .  bgs.<br />.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I am an original Trek fan, from the olden days.  I watched Deep Space 9, TNG and Voyager.  Did not really care for \\"9\\".  Andromeda was far superior.  But I think J.J. did this well.  Yes, it's a lot of noise and lights, but the original would have been if it coulda been.  Remember, they almost took it off the air, but heeded enraged protests from viewers, including NASA employees.  But this update is full of reality and the tech is updated well, now we have a better understanding of black holes, ship engineering, physics in general.. Characterizations are right on target; everybody acts like their old \\"selves\\" but younger.  I liked the movie a lot and I'm looking forward to the sequel which, I gather from the news leaks, will be a reenactment of Khan and crew getting tossed off Enterprise: a Botany Bay reprise.  Goody!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very good book. Great to teach kids, and adults!, how to treat people who are different with respect and normalcy.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Hemsworth was an excellent choice for Thor. I was impressed. I'm going to have to consider not allowing my wife to see the movie, since he does parade around sans shirt at one point. Ray Stevenson, also, was excellent. It was good to see the Warriors Three in the film.<br /><br />Asgard has a great look. It's very Jack Kirby. Stan Lee makes his traditional cameo. There's a nod to Journey Into Mystery, the comic book in which Thor makes his first appearance, if you're paying enough attention to catch it. And it was good to see Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) get more play. Even Hawkeye makes a brief appearance, which was also great. Anthony Hopkins filled out the role of Odin perfectly, and he probably didn't even break a sweat doing it. Although he did lose an eye.<br /><br />None of this to say that the movie didn't have some faults. There were some changes made to Marvel cannon that I can't bring myself to approve of. The main one, on the surface, was made for \\"story\\" reasons, but it wasn't necessary. If you're not a comic person, a Thor person, specifically, you'll never know, but it's one of those things that, as a fan, I have to wonder what they were thinking when they did that. Yes, it bothers me. But it doesn't affect the movie itself. The main flaw with movie is a bit of waffling with the character of Thor. He vacillates between being confused about Earth and seeming to not know where he is or what's going on to being very wise about Earth and the ways of man. It's like they couldn't decide which way to play the character and so used either of the extremes to fit the mood they wanted at any given moment. It would have been okay to have started at confused and ended at wise, but going back-and-forth doesn't really work.
0984536159|4.0|I love reading books like this. Not because I'm a supremacist, or enjoy what Hitler had done, or believe in his beliefs (For the most part, lets be honest.) My only reason for taking away one star on this book was because of the translation. I understand the James Murphy wanted it to read exactly has Hitler had written it, however... It was very hard to get in the rhythm of reading. a book. that. read, like. this For. No reason.<br /><br />He could have corrected the grammatical errors, and it wouldn't have lost any value or flare, in my opinion.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|So we went to see Paul. It's hilarious. Frequently, I laughed first and loudest. I think the movie was made just for me. However, the people sitting in front of us, what looked like a grandmother and her teenage grandson, didn't find the movie anywhere near as funny. I almost felt bad. Almost. If you like science fiction, especially Star Wars, you want to see this movie.<br /><br />I'm not going to say anything about the plot, though. That's how I went into it. I knew it was Simon Pegg and it had something to do with a CG alien. But that was enough for me. It's pretty much enough for me to just see Pegg's name on something. It's like he (and Nick Frost, his writing partner and co-star) is pop culture. But, please, don't pour milk on him. I'm not thinking he'd appreciate it. I will say one thing about the movie, it starts off at the San Diego Comic Con; alas, I've never been. >sob<<br /><br />But it's not just Paul. It's also Shaun of the Dead. And Hot Fuzz. And it's Spaced. That was British television series he did. Yeah, I know; you've never heard of it, but that's kind of where it all starts. The beginnings of his pop culture brilliance. Go watch it. Right now. I'll wait. Okay, not really, but you can come back later. The blog will still be here. Probably.<br /><br />Seriously, Simon Pegg makes movies out of the things that my friends and I used to joke about, and he's brilliant at it. Paul is under performing a bit at the box office, but don't let that stop you from going to see it. If you're a sci-fi fan, that is. If you're not, you're not going to get the movie at all. I think the lack of performance has more to do with the title than anything else. It doesn't scream what it's about like Shaun of the Dead. But the title is part of the joke. Paul. E. T. Simple. It fails to grab the imagination, though, so, unless you're actually looking for Simon Pegg vehicles, you're likely to miss it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I get it now, what all the hype was over this book. It was good, really good. Suzanne Collins takes something as familiar as a TV game show and twists it into an evil mechanism to control the population. In the arena, 24 teens must fight to the death; only one victor will leave alive. Sounds grim and gruesome, but somehow the humanity of the characters shines out amidst the darkness. The Hunger is definitely worth reading.
B005CMSDLE|2.0|In the past week or so, I've come across several lists of the toughest chicks in fiction. Some of these were for chicks in movies. Some for television. Some for both. Some from literature. None of these lists included Hanna, and for that, I think they are all lacking. Yes, even the literature lists should have included Hanna; she's that kick butt! In fact, she's so kick butt, I'm sure that that's where that movie came from. Someone said, \\"Hey! Let's make a movie about a young girl that can kick butt like no body's business!\\"<br /><br />Someone else tried to ruin  the party by saying, \\"But, wait, why can she kick so much butt?\\"<br /><br />And that's where it all fell apart.<br /><br />The movie, Hanna, is strung together on the very thinnest of plots. I mean Run, Lola, Run thin, but that one works better, because that's all the movie's supposed to be about. But the makers of Hanna, evidently, wanted the movie to appear as if it contains substance, so they tried to write a story as to why Hanna can and does kick so much butt. And I say makers, because I have no idea who might be at fault for this ill-conceived notion. Was it just bad writing from the start? Did the director dispense with the story in favor of the action? Did the producers demand it? Also, speaking of Lola, and I didn't time it, but I would guess somewhere close to 1/3 of Hanna is actually just music video of (mostly) her just running. Or crawling. Being chased, at any rate. Sometimes it's Erik.<br /><br />Having said all of that, if you like a good action flick and don't need much story, it's a great movie. My friend, who took me to see it, certainly liked it much better than I did. The fight scenes are well done, and there's plenty of suspense wrapped up in the action. And running. Lots of running. And I bet the director or the writer or someone thought they were being very clever by wrapping the movies ending up in a circle to tie it back to the opening. Oh, but wait, I'm letting my antipathy for the story slip back in there.<br /><br />The biggest issue with the story is that it resorts to the \\"big reveal\\" in order to explain the story all at once because it failed to provide the viewers with enough information as the movie progressed to figure anything out on  their own. Really, I hate this. Especially since they could have allowed us the information throughout the movie by cutting out 10 minutes of running.<br /><br />There was one other very positive aspect of Hanna: the acting. Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett are both excellent. In fact, they are the two characters that give the movie any sort of depth and weight. Saoirse Ronan (Hanna) does a fine job, but I haven't seen her in anything else, so I'm not sure if it was acting ability or just the way she is.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|We purchased the Blu Ray edition over the weekend and watched it last evening. We were concerned about the reviews centered around aspect ratio, although I must confess that my knowledge in that area is practically zero.  Aside from the fact that this is probably one of the greatest film productions ever, my wife and I did not experience any viewing issues in terms of tops and bottoms being cut off, or anything like that.  Many of the reviews focused on these issues, although it is possible that the particular product we purchased is different in terms of production, i.e., many of the reviews are many years ago, and perhaps it is possible that technological advances have improved on the production of the Blu Ray disc. I must also admit that the only time I've seen the movie in the past several decades is on television, many times with the old CRT tube-type and last night on our Samsung 52\\" LCD. We have no complaints.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The comic that the movie is based on was written by Warren Ellis. Ellis is a writer that I tend to like and is the creator/writer of one of my favorite series: Planetary. However, I never read RED, so I really had no idea of what it was about other than what I saw in the trailer for the movie. It was a movie I really wanted to go see in the theater, but... well... last year was full of chaos which included, during the summer while RED was in theaters, our van, nearly literally, blowing up (while I was inside it, no less), so I never did make it into the theater to see it. That turns out to be (mostly) okay. There are a few scenes that would have been great to see on the big screen, especially the scene where Moses steps out of the police car (but, of course, at the theater we couldn't have immediately rewound that one and watched it, again, as my wife demanded we do), but, overall, it isn't the sort of movie that loses its impact in translation to the television screen since the movie is about the characters, not about the action.<br /><br />The central character, Frank Moses, is played by Bruce Willis. This is just Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis, but, when you need an actor to play the part of Bruce, there is no one else that can do that, and he is great in this role. It would not surprise me if Willis was in Ellis' head as he wrote the character, although that is pure speculation on my part. At any rate, Bruce is completely enjoyable in his role as Frank Moses, and I can't really imagine anyone else doing the role the justice that Bruce gave it.<br /><br />Mary-Louise Parker plays the love interest, Sarah Ross. I've never been a big Mary-Louise Parker fan and never thought her memorable in any of the roles I've seen her in. In fact, I have to look to see what I actually have seen her in, so little impact she has had on me. I mean, I know she's the lead in Weeds, but I've never seen that and don't have any immediate plans to do so. However, she was perfectly delightful in  this role. She really brought just the right mixture of naivete, awe, and enthusiasm to the part. I'm not saying that there's not another actress that could have played that role, but she did a great job in it, and I can't think of anyone, off the top of my head, that could have done it better.<br /><br />Then there's Morgan Freeman. Freeman is another that is hired just to play himself, and, again, there is no one else that can play Morgan Freeman better. This is not to say that Freeman is incapable of a greater range than just playing himself; we've seen him in more than enough features to see that Freeman can play, pretty much, anything that is asked of him, but, when you need the, mostly, compassionate (grand)fatherly figure, there's probably no one better than Freeman, so he excels in his role. I can't say more than that without giving away pieces of the plot that you don't want to know about if you haven't seen  the movie.<br /><br />Freeman's counterpart is played by Helen Mirren, and she's no less than awesome. I believe that Helen Mirren can do pretty much anything, and I don't think she's ever hired to just \\"be herself.\\" I don't even know what that would mean as I don't think I've ever seen her do anything that had just become cliche for her. Certainly, I've never seen her behind a machine gun before, so that was pretty incredible and probably worth the whole movie. However, her role is really summed up in her comment to Sarah, \\"I kill people, Dear,\\" just as if she was saying \\"I made some cookies.\\" She was just perfect.<br /><br />And that brings us to John Malkovich. Malkovich is like crab to me, and I don't mean that in a good way. I spent years and years eating crab because I felt like I ought to like it, but, every time I did, I came away from it with the thought, \\"I just don't like it.\\" But I would try it, again, the next time because I felt likt I just ought to like it. Really, I did that for years before I finally decided, \\"you know, I really just don't like crab\\" and gave up on it for good. That is my experience with Malkovich. Any time he was in something, I would go into it with the thought that I ought to like it because it was John Malkovich, but I always came away just not liking the experience, most notably in Jonah Hex, which was just dreadful, I think, mostly, due to how horrible Malkovich was. There are a few notable exceptions, I suppose, such as Being John Malkovich, but he's not an actor I generally enjoy, mostly due to the fact that he's really just always the same in every role he's in. However, he was brilliant in RED! I'm not sure there is anyone else that could have pulled off this role and been believable in it. To some extent, he played the role the way he always is, but, it was like he turned his perfomance, this time, up to 11, and that's exactly what this called for.<br /><br />The cast of villains, however, is somewhat divided. Richard Dreyfuss is amazing, as always, but Rebecca Pidgeon could have been replaced by anyone. Sure, the role wasn't written to stand out, but she did nothing to really make it her own, either. Karl Urban, on the other hand, was great. Hunky, pretty boy assassin. His complete seriousness in the role gave it the gravity and believability it needed, and he was pretty perfect opposite Bruce Willis. Besides, my wife says he's hot, although he needs to smile more. According to her. The last player for the villains is Julian McMahon. Although, I really enjoyed him as Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four; he is completely forgettable in his role as the vice president in RED and, probably, could have been replaced by just about anyone walking down the street.<br /><br />I didn't get enough Ernest Borgnine. He's impossible not to love, and it's a great, albeit small, perfect role for him.<br /><br />My immediate response to the movie was \\"I'm going to have to buy this one.\\" And I will. My second response was, \\"The kids will love this,\\" and they did. I'm not really sayingit's a family movie, but it certainly is a great movie for my family. My younger son asked me if they were going to make a prequel for it. heh Interestingly enough, they did do some prequel comics to coincide with the release of the movie. I haven't read those, either, though. Unfortunately, although the movie did make money, it wasn't the blockbuster they'd hoped it would be, so it's unlikely that there will be anything further. I guess I'm okay with that. I think it does help illustrate, however, that, as a culture, our current love is for super heroes, not comic books in general. I think Hollywood is kind of stuck on the idea that anything translated from comics will be a hit, but even a wonderful movie like RED underperformed due to its lack of capes and tights, as the cliche goes.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun action/comedy, you should check RED out.
158234082X|1.0|That this book ever even got published says more about the insular world of NYC inner circles than it does about the author's writing ability, which is negligible. A long and tedious account of self-aggrandizement, chest thumping, and dubious boasting, there is nothing of any substance to be gleaned here. Spend your money on a good dinner instead of enriching this blowhard.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|so much better than the first. i read this one in 2.5 days and im not a reader. i loved it. you get a lot of info from this one.
030758836X|3.0|I was really loving this book until the last section. I thought the characters were really well developed, to the point that I was starting to cast the movie in my head (Charlize Theron as Amy?  Frances McDormand as Boney?).  The twists and turns were really interesting and I though \\"wow - I can't wait to see how THIS ends!!\\"  Then I got to the last section, which I found to be fairly implausible - I mean, seriously - Desi didn't have an alibi for July 5?  But I kept at it thinking the ending would be amazing. And then all of a sudden, it just....stopped.  I'm glad I checked this one out from the library :(
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I don't get where reviewers online are saying this movie is too loud, too predictable and generally uninspired. Not only that but they compare it to Michael Bay's Transformers film and they also say that it has absolutely nothing to do with the actual board game. Okay. How else could they have made this movie without treading ground that's already been covered? Personally, I think that Peter Berg did an excellent job with this film. Visually, I think Berg's film is a step above Bay's Transformers.<br /><br />Battleship, itself, is about an international naval battleship that is Earth's last hope against a hostile alien force at sea.<br /><br />Steven James Snyder of Time Magazine described the movie as \\"an unlikely mix of Independence Day, Pearl Harbor, Jurassic Park and The Hunt for Red October\\"..which, to me, is the most accurate description of this movie. That mix works for this movie.<br /><br />To me, Battleship was one of the better movies out there this summer, despite what everyone else has to say about it. I'll admit, there may have been better summer movies but, as far as sci-fi goes, Battleship was a great movie. I really enjoyed it! Hopefully, it will have a better life now that it's on DVD & Blu-ray. Give it a look, you won't be disappointed. I assure you!

030758836X|2.0|Unlike other readers who hated the ending, I liked the ending; But I hated the rest of the book. These are the most nauseating, despicable characters you could ever come in contact with. Which I guess means it was really capable writing because I was completely convinced. The problem was that I just couldn't tolerate the awfulness and I can't wait to get this book out of my head. My main advice, for sensitive readers who prefer a slightly more positive character or two in their books, is ... Don't read this book!
1423113454|5.0|Sadie and Carter Kane are the children of the Egyptologist, Dr. Julius Kane.  Little do they know that their dad isn't the average guy they think he is.  When he takes them to the British Museum, they learn they are linked to ancient Egyptian gods. They also learn that powerful forces are at work to unleash chaos which will destroy the earth.  It's up to Sadie and Carter to stop the evil and save the world.<br /><br />The Red Pyramid is action-packed from the start:  \\"We only have a few hours, so listen carefully.\\" How's that for a hook?  The adventure continues with explosions, mythical gods and monsters, and lots of ancient Egyptian history.  Riordan does a terrific job of weaving the history into the story without being too overbearing about it.  Sadie and Carter are great characters that readers will want to follow throughout the rest of the series.  There's even a good amount of humor.  One funny character is a baboon named Khufu.  His antics will make readers chuckle.<br /><br />The Red Pyramid is an excellent read for kids ages nine and up.  I highly recommend it.
0316069884|5.0|I have read many many books and quite a few of them have moved me. Many have played a part in shaping my views and perspective.  This might be the first book I have ever read that had such a profound impact that I can say it quite literally rocked my world. Such a thoughtful, intelligent, emotional, well-written, well debated and fascinating discussion of a topic that is of fundamental importance. This is the food we eat.  And this is how it comes to be on our plates and in our grocery stores.  Foer fully explores all the ethical dilemmas and moral questions. This is a must read for anyone questioning eating meat, anyone who cares to know about modern animal agriculture or how industrial factory farms and slaughterhouses have taken over every aspect of meat production.  He frames the entire discussion with a conversation of the importance of food to our family rituals and relationships.  He gets how important food is - and how important meat is to many people and cultures.  But when is the line crossed?  When do we finally say, as a society, that this is not acceptable.  What the industry is doing to the animals is not acceptable. What it is doing to our bodies is not acceptable. What it is doing to our environment is not acceptable. Your eyes will be opened and everything will look different.  I became a vegetarian after reading this book.  I had struggled with the moral questions of eating meat in general, but after realizing how damaging the meat industry has become, I wanted no part of it whatsover. You may or may not stop eating meat.  But I am pretty sure you will go the extra mile to find one of the few family farmers left who could, possibly, provide you with humanely raised and processed meat. This book is a quiet call to action. It is not demanding.  But it is a call to action simply having been written. We cannot ignore what is happening. After reading this book you will not be able to ignore it, nor will you want to.

B0057OORGC|4.0|I have a the stereo vinyl verson of this early 1967 Decca/London release & the MONO version caught my eye. Sundazed presents this mix in not surprisingly very impressive fashion. This LP works very well in mono as most of my favorite small combos of 60s rock & R&B do. The Group is basically stripped down to the quartet & sometimes less & some cuts have horns. Its a no frills blues band cut live by the vernerable Mike Vernon so you really dont miss the \\"seapration\\". Also, where Green is featured on cuts like the \\"Supernatural\\", Stumble & Sameway, the nuances of the guitar are very apparent in this monaural version. The rhythym section of Ansley Dunbar & John McVie sound very beefy front & center as well. I am not truly bowled over by this record as Green sounds too much like Clapton with the exception of \\"The Supernatural\\". You can hear the awsome potential that abounds from Green's playing & singing but I prefer Greens output as \\"leader of the Mac\\". This cd is a worthwhile entry to your Green collection but not essential.

B002PQ7JQK|1.0|The reason I have rated this set so low, is due to the two HUGE problems I have with it.  First the sound fluctuation between the dialogue and the music forces you to constantly mess with the volume control, or suffer through the incredibly loud music sequences.  I read a few reviews about this before I bought the set thinking that it probably wasn't as big of deal as these people made it out to be...IT IS!  I like to watch these episodes when I'm going to bed at night, so I don't want to have to keep fiddling with it...and the going to sleep part brings up my second problem with this set, which is the lack of a \\"play all\\" function.  Seriously? I don't think I have ever owned a TV series that DIDN'T offer this.  Even when I'm not trying to fall asleep, it becomes a tedious exercise having to go back to the main menu and and scroll though the options, etc.  The picture is fantastic and I dig the special effects enhancements they added, but they are wasted, because I NEVER watch these discs anymore because it's such a pain in the ass!  Shame on you Paramount!

B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved the first book and felt fairly good about the latter two books of this trilogy. I happened upon them maybe half a year before they started to become super popular and thus came the movie later. Now with that aside let me review the picture.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the film's presentation. It's very good though I found the novel even better. Part of the overall problem is that some of the emotional delivery is lost in a film as the main character cannot internalize nearly as much as she did in the novel and that was one of its greatest strengths.<br /><br />The tale focuses upon a post apocalyptic setting in which several cities (known as districts) are subservient and sometimes dependent upon a main city (simply named the capitol). The capitol is rich and basically drains the districts dry and punished them for for an earlier rebellion by doing something chilling yet believable enough: they force two children from each district compete in a televised arena of death in which only one victor may walk away. The arena fight is titled \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />What follows is our main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence), taking the place of her younger sister (you can volunteer but it's rare) and finds herself entering the alien world of the capitol where people live in splendorous excess and place bets on the final and only victor yet remain emotionally detached from the overall death arena.<br /><br />Katniss is sent with a boy named Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and they are mentored by a survivor of the Hunger Games known as Haymitch (played by Woody Harrelson) who numbs out the trauma of his time in the Hunger Games with sarcasm and especially drinking himself to the point of death yet even though he acts destructive he does want his district to do as well as possible. What then takes place is Katniss and Peta doing their best to win the affections of the audiences (especially sponsors who are allowed to send giftsto their favorites when the arena battle  begins) in preparation for the stomach grinding Hunger Games.<br /><br />Also starring Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci and Wes Bentley.<br /><br />Good music use to create mood like when the Hunger Games begin and you can hear the breathing and almost the heart beats of the competitors. There is a direct and honest brutality as the kids began to fight for resources. Camera shots are brief and purposefully confusing to create the proper setting as we adrenaline rush to the finale.<br /><br />The budget for this film was $78M and so far it has made a staggering sum of close to $685M at the Box Office. Like I said this film speaks to the movie going masses. A sequel is planned for the end of 2013.<br /><br />The author co-wrote the screenplay and that's why it's particularly faithful to the first novel.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; TRUE TO THE NOVEL: A minus to A; ACTION SCENES/HUNGER GAME FOCUSES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid August 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.

Although it did well no blockbuster style sequel was planned thereafter, just a direct to video DVD, \\"SWAT: Firefight\\" which included a totally new cast.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; ACTION SCENES: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of August 2012 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B.

1612183956|3.0|First, let me say that if you are planning to read this book from the Lending Library, DO IT.  Read it.  It's fun. Hey, it's free.  Don't read these reviews 1st.  My philosophy is that most of us will NEVER write a novel - so, who am I to offer a critique that might stop someone from reading another person's art?  STOP HERE AND READ IT.<br /><br />I read this book in 7 hours, which would lead you to believe that I loved it. Well, it was ok.<br />Yes, it is a definitely page turner - but for contrasting reasons; one good, one bad.<br /><br />Good: It's a gripping story with an intriguing, trippy, mystery that you just HAVE TO have the answer to. Where are Ethan Burke's colleagues?  Is he insane? What's the deal with this ominous yet idyllic town of Wayward Pines?  And so on...<br /><br />Bad: Toward the end, I was turning pages the same way I would use the FFWD button if watching a bad/slow movies.  It's hard to say why without giving too much away, but I will say that the chase scenes seemed endless, boring and, at a certain point, unnecessary.  Annoying really.<br /><br />*****Semi-spoiler alert (but not really): Also, I felt like this book was a rip-off of The Truman Show / The Village.  So much of the plot seemed way too familiar.  Though, it did make this an easy read and it was sort of comforting in that way.  I know that's a weird thing to say, but it's accurate - to me.  It's a great read for a plane ride, if you know what I mean.  He is not a wordsmith, but he tells a good story.<br /><br />I wish the author spent more time thinking about the explanation/ending before he wrote it.  At its core the explanation is satisfying and shocking, but it doesn't quite explain everything; especially the sadistic behaviour of some characters.<br />I felt ever so mildly disappointed when I was finished. But not completely so.

B008MBXFEM|3.0|The Dark Knight Rises is director Christopher Nolan's eagerly-awaited final installment in the Batman trilogy he initiated with Batman Begins in 2005, and continued with The Dark Knight in 2008. Set seven years after the conclusion of the second film, The Dark Knight Rises finds the billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) living in seclusion, having allowed his crime-fighting alter-ego Batman to take the blame for the crimes committed by the former DA Harvey Dent, including the murder of Wayne's soul-mate, Rachel. However, Wayne's self-imposed isolation is threatened by two very different interlopers into Gotham City: the formidable masked terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy), who seems to be masterminding a plan to undermine the very fabric of contemporary society, and sophisticated cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), who breaks into Wayne Manor to steal a necklace, but comes away with much more. To combat the rising threat, Wayne is forced to become Batman once more, but is he strong enough - mentally, and physically - to face the challenge? The film has an all-star supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard, and has become one of the most popular and successful box-office hits of 2012, ending Nolan's vision on an undisputed high note, but cleverly paving the way for future installments by different directors.<br /><br />Returning for the third time is composer Hans Zimmer, now having firmly supplanted David Julyan as Nolan's composer-of-choice. James Newton Howard is no longer credited as co-composer, but there is additional music by Lorne Balfe, Tom Holkenborg, Andrew Kawczynski, Jasha Klebe, Steve Mazzaro and Ramin Djawadi, as well as a whole cadre of conductors and orchestrators that take the numbers in the creative team to well over a dozen. I have been pretty tough on Zimmer of late, giving fairly short shrift to his work on the last Batman film, as well as the most recent entries into the Sherlock Holmes and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises. I'm not going to launch into a diatribe about Zimmer and what he and his multitude of underlings have done to the film music industry, because it's all been said before, and I'd be as guilty of repeating myself as Zimmer seems to be these days. Zimmer is Zimmer and he's never going to be anything else, and there's enough astonishingly good film music being written for smaller independent projects that it's just about possible to overlook his almost total dominance of the mainstream. However, the thing a lot of people tend to forget - and I have been guilty of this myself - is that Zimmer is more than capable of writing truly terrific music, and it is with that in mind that I find myself somewhat shocked to be writing the following statement: parts of The Dark Knight Rises are actually pretty darn good.<br /><br />Of course, it follows the style and tone of the previous two films, restating the now-familiar two-note Batman motif, as well as several of the familiar action motifs heard throughout this film's predecessors. The orchestral makeup of the score barely deviates from the pattern, with the endless churning cello ostinati, thunderous percussion hits, low-register brass calls, and multitude of industrial-sounding electronic textures overlaying everything, as we have come to expect. Where The Dark Knight Rises surprises is in its intelligence in the application of its thematic elements, which add an unexpectedly fulfilling layer of sophisticated subtext to Nolan's already intellectually murky world.<br /><br />Zimmer's main new element is what is popularly known as `Bane's Chant', an unpolished male voice choir intoning the words \\"deshi basara\\" over an unusually-metered percussion loop. The chant, which translates from the original Moroccan Arabic as \\"he rises\\", is an amalgamation of many different voices which were recorded by members of the public and sent to Zimmer over the internet, and forms the cornerstone of many cues, ranging from the portentous \\"Gotham's Reckoning\\", parts of \\"The Fire Rises\\", the middle section of the wonderfully chaotic \\"Fear Will Find You\\", and during the dramatic and relentless \\"Imagine the Fire\\". At first, the theme clearly appears to be a recurring leitmotif for Bane; however (and here be spoilers), the application of the theme is actually much cleverer than that. Yes, the theme regularly accompanies Bane and his dastardly antics, and it provides a menacing herald for his appearances on-screen. However, the theme also plays when Wayne - cast down into a prison of despair in a remote part of India - makes his dangerous ascent out of the \\"pit\\", conquering both the physical and mental barriers facing him. Later, it plays against scenes featuring the child of Batman's nemesis Ra's Al Ghul, who was forced to make a similar climb to freedom, and during the conclusive battle between Batman and Bane, it underscores their flying fists of fury. Considering the previous scenes it played against, you are never quite sure whose side it's on during this conclusive mano-a-mano. Ultimately, the theme doesn't really herald one particular character - instead, it's an all encompassing theme for people who have overcome massive adversity, who have `risen up' both figuratively and literally, as Wayne, Bane, the child of Ra's Al Ghul all had to do. Although their life trajectories ultimately diverged greatly, they all had to conquer enormous obstacles to get to where they were.<br /><br />The other major new thematic element is the theme for Selina Kyle, a sly, mysterious, slightly mischievous tinkling piano motif that, more often than not, is accompanied by the sound of a gently rattling metal chain in the percussion section. Following its initial, forthright appearance in \\"Mind If I Cut In?\\", the theme takes a back seat for most of the rest of the score, only making fleeting guest appearances thereafter. In \\"Nothing Out There\\", for example, the chain sound appears both on its own, and as a prelude to a restatement of the piano motif, and the same chain effect can be heard towards the end of the bonus track `All Out War\\". Actually, Selina's theme is much more prominent in the film mix than it is on the soundtrack album, and one can only surmise that the CD producers took an editorial decision to limit its appearances here. Selina's theme, while perfectly serviceable, doesn't quite have the same instant memorability as Bane's Chant, and it is in these quieter moments that James Newton Howard's creative touch is missed the most; the alluring, slightly twisted sexual chemistry between Wayne and Kyle is prime real estate for a composer of Howard's deftness, and could have been something great as opposed to something just `OK'.<br /><br />The rest of the score, where these new elements are not present, follows the formula set down in previous Batman films, almost to the point where it seems that certain cues have been lifted wholesale from earlier Batman scores. The large-scale action sequences, of which there are many, repeat almost verbatim the thrusting, propulsive Batman action motifs from the earlier scores, with large sections of cues such as \\"The Fire Rises\\", \\"Fear Will Find You\\" and \\"Imagine the Fire\\" mirroring the likes of \\"Molossus\\" and \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\" almost perfectly. \\"Despair\\" contains the score's most front-and-center performance of the 2-note Batman theme, accompanied by the now-familiar synthesized `wing-flapping\\" effect. Both the introspective \\"Born in Darkness\\" and the score's emotional finale in \\"Rise\\" reprise the grandiose string performances first heard in the \\"Macrotus\\" and \\"Corynorhinus\\" cues from the original Batman Begins, the latter augmented by a boy soprano solo, consolidating the theme as a pseudo-love theme for the Wayne family, Bruce's relationship with Alfred, and the memory of his parents.<br /><br />These cues are certainly appealing enough in context, are undeniably imposing, and they do give the trilogy of scores a pleasing continuity, but it would have been nice to hear Zimmer step up with a new action riff here and there, rather than simply making his cellists churn their arms off for the 20th time. Really, the only new twist in the tale is the unusual ethereal synth performance of the 2-note Batman theme in \\"On Thin Ice\\", but this is one of the few moments where Zimmer actually plays around with variations on his original thematic core. This is the same problem Zimmer faced on the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, where he seemed content simply to restate note-for-note whole chunks of score from previous films, and he has fallen into the same disappointing trap here too.<br /><br />The five bonus cues can be found via various different sources, either via the physical CD, by purchasing them online separately, or by downloading it from a special website on movietickets.com. Although it's a pain to have to go to multiple sources to gain access to the full scope of the score (much like the Tron Legacy situation the other year), it's worth tracking them all down as, in sum, they do give a much more comprehensive overview of everything the score has to offer. Cues such as \\"No Stone Unturned\\" and \\"The Shadows Betray You\\", for example, contain several exciting variations on Bane's Chant (the latter containing an especially dark, unrelenting electronic pulse and a brooding flipped variation on the 2-note Batman motif), while \\"Risen From Darkness\\" has a very cool moment where Batman's heroic action theme and Bane's Chant play in powerful counterpoint to one another.<br /><br />In many ways, The Dark Knight Rises showcases both the best and the worst of Hans Zimmer's musical personality in one all-encompassing score. On the one hand, the intellectual design and intelligent use of Bane's Chant shows Zimmer at his creative best, taking a simple idea and working it around to suggest complex concepts and subtle changes in context. The three or four recurring themes from across the entire trilogy give the Batman persona a definitive musical identity, and it's impossible to deny the sheer emotional thrill of feeling your seat rumble and your hair vibrate to this music when the theme kicks in during the film itself. On the other hand, you have the same old arguments: the Zimmer sound permeating the Hollywood mainstream to such a degree that composers as talented as Alan Silvestri and Patrick Doyle are being asked to ape the style; the fact that Zimmer himself seems to be stuck in a rut, writing what in effect are little more than variations of the same score on almost every action film he tackles; the over-reliance on electronic enhancements, ghostwriters, arrangers, and so on and so on. The bottom line is this: fans of the Zimmer style will love it, fans and of the current Batman style will love it, whereas anyone whose musical tastes tend to veer towards the predominantly orchestral will find a great deal of it boring, or unpalatable, or both. The exception to that rule, of course, is me: having been thoroughly underwhelmed with The Dark Knight, I fully expected to thoroughly hate The Dark Knight Rises, and I am as surprised as anyone to find that - despite the caveats and asterisks - I enjoy it as much as I do.
0446547573|3.0|Katie has a secret and a past....  I picked up this book at the airport, having never read a Nicholas Sparks book before or seen any movies based on his books.  I know what you are thinking, I must live in a bunker somewhere remote, but I assure you, I have a nice and comfortable studio apartment somewhere metro.  Anyway, I expected a tear jerker like Mitch Albom's novellas or a romance that defies time.  Instead, this was a simple book with a simple plot and a simple love story that is not too far fetched.  Well, maybe except for the last three pages of the novel, which contradicted my previous statement of being simple and I did cry like a baby and it threw in the \\"romance that defies time\\" angle.  Overall, this was an average read for me.

1451648537|4.0|This is clearly a competent, well-rounded book, written by a professional who doesn't make too many mistakes.  It doesn't appear that it is driven by any specific agenda either, so I believe the reality is well represented, in a straightforward sense.<br />However, it doesn't do the man full justice.  Mr. Jobs was a complex character, driven by demons, with a big black hole right in the middle of his soul.  He was an exceptional man, who, like him or not, by action fair and unfair to others, had impacted the world in a profound way.<br />I'm certain there will be more non-fiction published.  However, Steve's life story almost begs the type of treatment Zuckerberg got in The Social Network - semi-fictionalized.  A level of abstraction would grant a writer a welcome artistic license to the story.<br />After reading this book, I had a feeling that, with the death of Mr. Jobs, Apple is very likely to set itself on the path to \\"Microsoftization\\".  The captain had left the ship, after all.

B002ZG99A4|3.0|The Blu Ray and the DVD discs play just fine, but why do we also have to pay for a digital copy when it is already expired? The releasing companies need to advise in their advertising and promotion of a product if one or more of the features has expired and is useless. Otherwise, the movie was ok. Amazon.com should also be made aware of this issue so they can provide this info to their customers.
B005IQZB14|1.0|I found this book tedious, monotonous. I don't know what I am more annoyed at, this book ,the Money or the time I wasted on reading this. Clearly my wasted time! after awhile I kept anticipating something worth reading on the next page. Don't give up on it yet,there was still the hope of something interesting as I would turn the next page, I told myself. I think it would have been easier hiking the PCT then reading this author's Big dissapointment.

I had a really hard time getting into the character dialogue and really feeling like I was part of the story. I don't know if other readers felt this way, or if this is just how I interracted with the text for whatever reason. I wouldn't recommend the book, though.

0307887448|4.0|This novel is a quick read and will be enjoyable to anyone who is interested in 80s pop culture (or lived through the decade).  The plot involves a near-future world in which the majority of the human race conducts most activites in the virtual world of the OASIS.  When its inventor dies, he sets up a Willy Wonka-style videogame competition to inherit his sizable fortune.  The underdog protagonist, Wade/Parzival, embarks on a quest to win the competition.<br /><br />In terms of world-building, author Ernest Cline does an excellent job, detailing a world in which commerce, education, and social interaction are conducted in virtual reality.  There are, however, some minor plot holes.  (The world is supposed to be destitute and on the brink of collapse, with refugees living in skyscraper trailer parks, yet most people still seem to be able to afford expensive computer equipment and can still order pizza.)  The villains, the Sixers, are underdeveloped.  They're evil because they're corporate, and their master plan is to take over the OASIS - so that they can charge for its use and sell advertising.<br /><br />The writing is clear but unremarkable.  The novel is also overloaded with 80s references, some well-known, some slightly obscure, and some completely esoteric.  I enjoyed things like debates about the quality of the Ewok TV movies and a battle between Ultraman and Mechagodzilla; some readers may not.  If you don't get those references, this probably isn't the book for you.  There's also an undertone throughout the novel of \\"being an antisocial geek\\".  For example, scenes in which the protagonist works as tech support and berates his customers, who are portrayed as mouth-breathing slobs, might make a person feel that he is reading bitter nerd arguments on message boards instead of a novel.  The book is overall an enjoyable and fun read, however.  Just don't expect The Great Gatsby.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|most games require Internet so I cant play them on road trips. This app does not require Internet to play wich makes it one of my most played games when ever we go some where without wifi. I also like this game because it is challenging and that's always better than games that require your brain to be lazy.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|great game all around. still only tried campaign mode but plenty of tactical/fun play. good choice for those who want something a bit more relaxed and not button/screen jamming gameplay.
B005LAIGKU|3.0|David Koepp's \\"Premium Rush\\" is a skillfully made, late-summer adrenaline rush with a plot that does not bear one second's scrutiny. Not only is the screenplay flimsy, but it rewards some fairly reprehensible behavior on the part of the hero, New York bike messenger Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Wilee's the hero largely because his antagonist, corrupt cop Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon), is so irredeemably hateful and evil. We're not really supposed to care about them, or Wilee's true-blue girlfriend (Dania Ramirez), or his rival for the girl (Wole Parks), or the young Asian woman (Jamie Chung) whose future happiness depends on Wilee getting her envelope to the intended recipient on time. We're only supposed to care about the breath-stopping, state-of-the-art bike stunts, as Wilee and crew ride into wrong-way traffic, down flights of stairs and across the tops of cars to elude the nefarious Monday.<br /><br />Gordon-Levitt and Shannon are two of the best actors of their generation, but \\"Premium Rush\\" won't be cited among their accomplishments when their stars are unveiled on Hollywood Boulevard. Gordon-Levitt was hired because he can play a likable smart aleck and looks good on a bike. Shannon was hired because he is very convincing when he is maniacally unhinged. Their roles call for just those things, and nothing more, though they do them exceedingly well. The real stars of \\"Premium Rush\\" are the cinematographer, film editors and squads of bike stunt riders, though to his credit Gordon-Levitt did a fair amount of his own stunts. (The closing credits show the aftermath of Gordon-Levitt being pitched headfirst into the back windshield of a taxi.) Here's hoping Gordon-Levitt and Shannon grabbed their paychecks, bought their Ferraris and roared off to play roles that really show off what they can do.

1609611543|5.0|FINALLY!<br /><br />After years of suspecting I was sensitive to certain foods, this book and my own experiment confirms it. I thought I had a lactose intolerance, but realized I was eating wheat with my dairy and incorrectly assumed it was dairy that was the culprit.  I now know dairy is not a problem for me-it is WHEAT AND GLUTEN!<br /><br />Wheat and sugar induce an inflammatory response for me from a coated tongue to itchy ears and red painful tongue and cracked corners of my mouth to very unplesant lower GI issues, joint pain, water retention, brain fog and overall fatigue-all happening on some days and not others. It was a mystery to me.<br /><br />After removing wheat from my diet for 10 days, and eating a low carb lean protein, non-starchy veggie and low sugar fruit diet I felt much, much better.  Yesterday I decided to test myself and ate 2 slices of toast and a handful of pretzels. OMG within 30 minutes I felt terrible.  I am convinced I have a gluten/wheat intolerance and will happily say goodbye to them.<br /><br />Buy the book.  Read the science behind how eating wheat/gluten drives up insuiln and causes fat storage, and make the changes required in your eating.  Trust me-it is worth it.

B008602KQI|4.0|I did not read the book. I am a big fan of Koushun Takami's Battle Royale, but not of the movie version(it cut out alot of the subtext in favor of showcasing children killing children). And while I don't believe the author for one second that they were unaware of Takami's novel. Also, while this was marketed pretty much under the same banner as twilight... there's enough distinguishing features to make it it's own. First, the twilight movies are garbage. Nothing against the plot and character's, they are just poorly made and poorly acted, by some. Second, where as Battle Royale gives each character a chapter or so, this movie is definately a single character's point of view. The scripted reality television angle of the movie is genious. The movie intentionally and repeatedly removes the audience from the story of Katniss to remind us that we are merely spectators. For those who wonder why Katniss is so \\"special\\" it is because of 2 things and I have a feeling they will come into play with later movies. 1. Katniss defied the rules. Volunteering as tribute and the end. Obviously this pisses the game makers off as they dont like to be played with. 2. Getting back to the scripted reality portion of the flick. Katniss is special because we the audience chose her. If you're a fan of reality programming you know that these shows revolve around real reactions to scripted events. Producers edit the content to create a storyline based on or in order to influence audience's perceptions. Basically they portray characters to be fan favorites or tv villains. Katniss fills the fan favorite position. She volunteers for tribute. she rides in to the capitol on  a chariot while on f*&king fire. She becomes the talk of the initial interviews. She's quick to act on the behalf of others but even quicker with the bow, and also lets one suffer just a tad longer before easing their pain (monkey things), and \\"plays\\" into the love story thats been crafted.<br />By the way, Jennifer Lawrence isamazing. Gorgeous and has a subtle strength and vulnerability that a Ms KS wishes she had a tenth of. The twilight love triangle is pulled off brillantly in this movie. While its definately one sided, as that guy who wasn't a tribute didn't have much screentime, I had to stop and recall her initial interest in the guy, still can't think of his name, and just how far Kat actually played to win this game.<br />But this is all also the movie's biggest weakness. It's smarter then its marketed as. It wants desperately to ride the coat tails of twilight when its more then capable of standing on its own. The acting is great save for 1 poorly done monologue by katos or whatever his name was. The plot is interesting if not absurd, but it works. When monkey things are brought to life you go \\"Are you serious right now?\\" but then you remember this is a \\"television show\\" first and foremost. I am looking foward to getting some answers out of the sequels, I went in knowing it was a quadrilogy and was expecting answers to be left out. if you weren't or aren't aware of this and don't want to invest your time in sequels then drop another star from my review. otherwise its more then what i was expecting if a little out of left field at times, the concept of the tradition doesn't seem to be as realized, at least not yet, as Battle Royale. Also once again the moneky things. Really?

B000SEIK2S|2.0|I'm glad I got this book from the library instead of buying it based on all the rave reviews here. This is so clearly a retread of \\"The Forever War,\\" by Joe Haldeman, that it was a chore to read. Yes, Scalzi does add a dash of Heinlein, but then I was always very ambivalent about Heinlein when I was reading him in the 1960s... too jingoistic and misogynistic. I'll try another Scalzi book at some point, but it won't be because of this tepid effort.

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|This is a review of the movie as it stands on its own. I have not read the book and I am not familiar with anything that happened prior to watching this 2 hour and 13 minute long movie. I watched the Instant Video (streaming), so I can't comment on the contents of the DVD/BluRay and their special features.<br /><br />The movie had a lot of action and special effects, which often increases the entertainment value. This part I have no problems with.<br /><br />However, there were problems with the characters. The lead actor was very weak for an epic movie of this caliber. He was barely two dimensional, and not very convincing. The post-production team tried hard to give him some depth with the flashbacks filling in his back-story, but the lead actor was just unconvincing.<br /><br />The lead actress was not as bad as the lead actor, but still, it was an average performance at best. The rest of the human characters were either undeveloped or too one dimensional. The CGI characters were actually acting better than the humans and that's not something you want said about your blockbuster movie.<br /><br />Speaking of the CGI characters, I couldn't help but get Avatar vibes, and steampunk bandwagoneering. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing - that's how Hollywood works after all.<br /><br />Speaking of Hollywood, another issue I have with this, and many other movies: it is easy to see patterns of where things are heading. In recent memory, the only exception I can recall was [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9 [Blu-ray]]] where they danced upon movie plot cliches and swerved in completely different directions.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend someone to watch this movie. It's not bad, but it's not great.

B004XWLN20|5.0|As a fan of Smallville, I felt compelled to write a review on not just the show but also this 'complete' series set.<br /><br />Smallville is an amazing show. I'm assuming if you're here and thinking about buying this set you would have to already know that. It has everything a good show has; A great charismatic cast with great to average acting abilities which allows the cast to grow on you very quickly. It has terrific major and minor story arcs along with the 'monster of the week' formula that X-Files did so well. There weren't a whole lot of tears to be shed during the whole series but when it happens, it's the waterworks of the century, trust me. Also, I have never seen another television show that had me (on a multitude of occasions) jump up off the couch with goosebumps screaming, \\"OMG that was soo awesome!\\". Watching a bowling ball being thrown slow-motion through a wall disabling a gunmen was B.A and still remains one of my favorite 'Superman' scenes.  Tom Welling as Clark Kent/ Kal El was the perfect casting choice for this Superman-to-be as he was very tall, strong and handsome but was also very believable as a 'human' teenager with becoming an adult with god-like abilities. I hope for the best with the new 'Man of Steel' coming out next year and hope they take a page or two out of Smallville's book.<br /><br />The show was mostly strong throughout the entire series with a few arcs that went on for far too long, but always seemed to get back on track and tidy up perfectly before the end of those seasons. I believe 8 seasons could have wrapped things up nicely if they had removed a few of the needless-long-minor-arcs and didn't stretch out the rest through the 10th. But needless to say, I'm happy with the way everything was tied up by the series finale.<br /><br />Now to the review of the product.<br /><br />If you want to have access to all ten seasons on DVD in a nice collector's box which looks great on any shelf, then this is for you. However, if you're wanting the 'super ultimate collector's edition' with  a lot of of behind the scenes extras, bonus discs, etc, then you won't find that. Being that it's DVD and not Blu Ray, you'll still get the low resolution and sometimes grainy scenes when the shot is at night or in a dark building. There is some bonus content on the discs, but it's what has been available for years on the standalone series discs. I would assume that since there are so many discs already, that the collector's box would be far too large for the average persons' shelf if even more were added. The collector's box is setup similar to a photo album with two albums containing the first half and last half of the show.<br /><br />Because I saved 200 dollars off the original price, I'm completely content with the 140 dollars I spent. If we break it down, I spent about 14 dollars per season when a single season normally costs around 35 bucks. It was a steal in that case.<br /><br />I hope this helps. Smallville F-n rocks!

0743289692|5.0|This book is eye opening.  Things I knew were true were confirmed by Ms. Ali.  It is an informative book on Islam, African clans/tribal conflicts, Governments/parties, and human rights.  Very good book.  I couldn't stop reading it and when I had to, I couldn't wait to continue.  Just gripping!  I learned a lot about the above topics and wish the entire world would listen to her.  If Muslims read their book (Koran) they will have to face the reality that Ms. Ali did as well.  All politicans should educate themselves with this book.

B0079R8KXG|3.0|We bought one in purple and one in camouflage in July 2012.  The purple one's fabric is thinning out and ripping where it folds and it appears to have been glued in areas where this occurs.  The camouflage one is in tact so far.  My friend recommended the Genuine Leather and we will have to purchase that.  The higher price may be an indicator that it is better than this one.  At least we didn't lose out on too much buying this piece of junk.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|In casual mode, no timed sessions to hunt and find the game items.  Not that difficult for novice players. I play when its quiet to relax.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app works with a large amount of programs and is helpful for making small changes. I got when it was free from amazon. Much better offering then some of there free apps lately.
B008KW43TE|4.0|i know music in an art but this album is very unorthodox...i suggest listening to it on spotify first before purchasing. i found the randomness of song choices to be quite entertaining...
1419703692|5.0|This is beautifully done. It shows the making of all 3 Batman movies with detailed descriptions and art. If you're a Batman fan and love the Chris Nolan movies like myself, this is a must have.
0425263908|3.0|The beginning of the story was interesting, but it never really led anywhere. There were so many things going on, but no REAL story to follow.
0345803493|3.0|For a book that is poorley written, I have not been able to stop reading it since i've purchased it. This book seems to be much more emotional compared to the first book, Fifty Shades of Grey. The characters are finally expressing their love for one another physically and verbally. The author should have took her time to come up with better words to express the characters emotion. She often contradicts and uses certain words in the wrong context. Even though the book is poorley written, I find the book to be very intriguing. THe author does a great job of grabbing the readers attention. I personally would recommend this book, solely for entertainment.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Okay its not the greatest app in the world but I recommend you get it. Its all right really. It keeps you informed about your battery life. There is one thing that is annoying. make sure that when you plug it into your kindle that you are not doing anything. It will automatically pop up and interior what you are doing. Other than that, its a pretty awesome app.
0956251579|5.0|I saw the ad for this book on Facebook, and, as I'm always looking for new authors to read, though \\"Why not?\\"  I could NOT put the book down!  So, so suspenceful!  I've recommended it to so many friends, and they have all loved it!  Cannot wait to read more from this author!  I see she has another out...just waiting for it to be released to Kindle!  I might have to go buy the paperback to add to my already over-stuffed bookshelves! :)

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|From what I saw in the trailers John Carter looked stupid, thus I never saw it on the big screen. What a mistake! It was so well done and so exiting and some of the most endearing characters and creatures any fan of Syfy could ask for! I just finished watching it on my computer via Amazon on Demand and I wish I could have seen it in the theaters!
B0026PW67W|2.0|This map was bought as a present for my son, who loves all things Harry Potter. However, the map was a bit disappointing (to myself, also a fan) in that several parts of the map were just reprinted portions of other parts of the same map. For example the hidden passage to Hogsmeade appears at least twice. Further, there was no Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor or Hufflepuff House anywhere on the map. Granted - it would take a lot of imagination and thought to map a multidimensional bluprint of Hogwarts, but it could be done. At the very least, the map creators could have aspired to not duplicating the same rooms. If the size of the map reflected the effort of trying to fit in all of Hogwarts, that would have been admirable. Instead, this is the bare minimum in terms of any sort of replica.<br /><br />Beware Harry Potter fans. While the map is certainly a fairly decent nod to the original concept, anyone expecting to actually see a realistic blueprint of Hogwarts will be disappointed.
B003XU02QG|4.0|This is not a bad movie.  Plenty of action and story to go along. If you like historical movies this one's for you.
B008D28HYS|4.0|It's a decent game worth playing. Some of the designs are awful small even on my Nexus 7. Is it worth $5? No. It should be $1 and no more. Glad I got it for free.
030758836X|3.0|The book kept my attention but went downhill and became more and more contrived toward the end. I would agree with other reviewers that the author did not seem to know how to end it. And I don't think she ever revealed the content of the silver box that was found early on in the closet?
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is amazing, from the theme to the play the humor. everything!!! addicting and even more addicting with the missions and upgrades I can have hours of fun. you should get it since is free!!!!!
B00003CX8N|5.0|Helene Hanff is a writer and lover of Shakespearean English literature.  In 1949, she begins corresponding with bookseller, Frank Doel of London, to acquire antiquarian books she cannot find in the U.S.  A lasting friendship ensues over many years and a great distance.  The two form a deep bond over their love of books. A charming story.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|A good story that keeps your interest. Just when you think it may become a bit predictable, you are pleasantly surprised by the author's 'handling' of various situations. I liked the characters who were very human within a storyline which is real to so many, and controversial in its own right. Overall, a satisfying read, that prompted me to look into other books by this author.
B008K7WCJM|5.0|All Swans' previous styles find a home on this opus magnum constructed around the three long pieces A Piece of the Sky, The Apostate and The Seer. The addition of accordion, bells, clarinet, hammer dulcimer, orchestral bells, vibraphone and \\"hand-made violin thing\\" bring nuance and depth to the music.<br /><br />As early as the late 1980s/early 1990s albums like [[ASIN:B000008LB7 Children of God]] and White Light from the Mouth of Infinity, Michael Gira's talent as a modern classical composer was evident. Later works like Soundtracks For The Blind and [[ASIN:B000000SVM Die T&uuml;r ist Zu]] with tracks like Ligeti's Breath/Hilflos Kind, confirmed it.<br /><br />The Seer's centrepiece, the title track, recalls the Swans-related Body Lovers project of 1998 titled [[ASIN:B0000060P7 Number One of Three]], a 73-minute journey through alternately spooky, soothing, soulful, depressing, uplifting, disturbing and inspiring soundscapes. Symphonic swirls alternate with industrial beats and certain movements encompass disparate elements like drones that are followed by typical rock instruments that in turn make way for solos.<br /><br />The Seer has much, much more in the form of bagpipes, chants, chimes, chorales, churncore, harmonica, horns, glockenspiel, gongs, fractured vocals, industrial drones and thuds, a wealth of percussion, ragas and searing guitar riffs. \\"I see it all\\" Gira intones throughout most of the shifting textures. After about 15 minutes, a manic drum pattern takes the spotlight until it fades as the mournful wails of what sounds like the \\"hand-made violin thing\\" and similar instruments change the tone and tempo again. Gira's proper singing starts after 28 minutes, concluding this incredible track in an [[ASIN:B00005AVFD Angels of Light]] mood.<br /><br />The Seer Returns has repetitive marching beats behind Gira's sung and chanted vocals but it's Jarboe's voice collages that add a further dimension to the song. They resemble her work on Dark Consort, the collaborative album with Cedric Victor. The spectre of Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg haunts 93rd Ave Blues with high pitched squeals, violent crashes and zombie-like vocal exclamations. There is a resemblance to Sch&ouml;nberg's work as he moved into serialist music, specifically Six Lieder Opus III. When this psychotic chamber music has dissolved into utter cacophony, it is displaced by a power drone.<br /><br />Behold! Angels of Light appear again on the short mid-tempo song The Daughter Brings The Water but a stranger angel inspires Song For a Warrior. The anima of Swans emerges in a fragile, melodious ballad sung  by Karen O whose delivery of the oblique lyrics remain true to Jarboe's eerie contributions on various [[ASIN:B000WBBH54 World of Skin]] and Swans albums.<br /><br />Bells and percussion bookmark Gira's observations on Avatar of the performer as a medium. Avatar's intensity is taken to extremes on The Apostate, a magnificent piece of propulsive rock with guitars that howl and swirl, shattering cymbals, mesmerising bass riffs, thunderous drums and ululations that brutalise and uplift the soul at the same time.<br /><br />The crackling fire that brings Piece of the Sky is followed by [[ASIN:B000784X0S Jarboe]]'s hypnotic chorale that descends from soprano to alto/contralto and even further down when Gira's voice comes in. In the background, occasional muffled moans embellish a persistent polyphonic drone. Then a joyful burst of stringed instruments come to the fore and fade away under the undulating textures of a raga. A segment of tuneful folk with poetic lyrics brings Piece of the Sky to a close.<br /><br />The Seer resembles [[ASIN:B00005OAJR Soundtracks for the Blind]] in the rare occurrence of lyrics so the music is the messenger of many moods. Swans' intensity haunts the harsh and humble moments, the dirge and the dance alike. That is their magic which was spread rather thin on the previous album.

B008602KQI|3.0|this is a great movie for anyone who likes action adventure .<br />the acting was very good . the movie does take some time to get going but once it does it is very entertaining .
B005FISBTO|5.0|This season of Dexter I thought was really good. Dexter is on top of his game as a forensic specialist and he cleans up multiple serial killer cases with his own hands, literally. I especially like the Doomsday Killer and the intense tableaus that were set up to depict the end of times at each step of the prophecy. Having a religious serial killer made Dexter question his beliefs and also his dark passenger that drives him. For me this is one of the best Dexter Seasons and the story lines and plots were well done.<br /><br />The thing I didn't like was that every single disk had a two minute Showtime commercial that started the disk. You were locked from skipping it, fast forwarding it or going to the disk menu to start an episode. If that was not bad enough, it is on every disk and if you ejected a disk and later reinstalled it you had to watch it again. Now here is the really bad part! This ad included the ending of Dexter Season Six in the ad and it shows you the closing scene of the season. Brilliant, just brilliant! That was one of the most shocking scenes and now it is ruined.<br /><br />I enjoyed the season and it is worth buying and watching. It is outstanding! It is a 5 star season.<br /><br />The way the disks are made it is a 1 star set of disks.<br /><br />I am tired of buying disks that start off with commercials for movies, ads, anti-cigarette smoking ads, and Blue-ray ads. Some disks that you buy also include a plea to donate money to save old films. Didn't you make enough money off them to restore them yourself? Lately some of the disks will not even let you skip, speed forward or go to the menu. I paid for the disk and I don't want to pay for ads! They are ruining the entertainment factor of something that I am buying. Get rid of them.<br /><br />If you buy this DVD set, do not watch the 2 minute intro to avoid this massive spoiler!

1596912863|4.0|Many of us would like to try a journey to the English countryside and even better try a Regency trial period.  I liked the premise of this very much.  There were a couple scenarios I didn't like but it was just because it would be an unpleasant experience but not that it wouldn't have happened. I could have lived without the description of the \\"gentleman\\" with his pants unbuttoned.  Makes one ask the question - \\"could you give up your technology for a few weeks\\"?
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app! Very accurate, easy to understand and pretty to look at. Too bad there aren't more like this one no bugs here.
042521771X|4.0|Many of Austen's characters don't have alot written about them so we could say they need a little fleshing out.  I appreciated Ms. Grange's work on Mr. Knightley because I've never felt like I've ever really captured him in my mind.  I've read all the diaries and Knightley and Tilney are my favorites.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|With the end of the \\"Harry Potter\\" saga and the \\"Twilight\\" series about to wrap up, Hollywood is ripe for a new movie franchise to take their place. After several attempts, Lionsgate came out on top with this summer's highly successful \\"The Hunger Games.\\" Obsessed fans can now watch their favorite characters battle it out with each other anytime they want thanks to the release of the movie on Blu-ray and DVD.<br /><br />For those who live under a rock, the Hunger Games are an annual event that pit children from different districts against each other in a battle to the death. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Evergreen must rely on her training and archery skills to survive and return to her family. Her feelings for another competitor in the deadly Games complicate matters.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is thought-provoking. It also contains layers of social commentary which add to its allure for teens and adults alike. Is it violent and controversial? Of course it is. It wouldn't be as wildly popular as it is if it wasn't.<br /><br />Director Gary Ross does a wonderful job of capturing the animalistic nature and tragedy of the Games in a faux-shaky cam way that makes viewers feel like they're in the thick of the action. However, it doesn't cause you to want to blow chunks at the screen like \\"Paranormal Activity\\" or \\"The Last Exorcism\\" do.<br /><br />The high definition transfer of \\"The Hunger Games\\" is fabulous. The picture looks phenomenal and captures every color and image put forth. It's a visual feast for the eyes with all the nature shots and CG city scenes. The dynamic 7.1 surround sound mix guarantees that viewers won't miss one single tiny noise, piece of dialogue, or tree rustling in the forest.<br /><br />Consumers and fans will be pleased with all the special features contained in the release. There's a two-hour documentary entitled \\"The World is Watching: Making 'The Hunger Games'\\" which includes interviews with the cast, crew, and author Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />Five featurettes with varying lengths are found as well. They're \\"Game Maker: Suzanne Collins and 'The Hunger Games' Phenomenon,\\" \\"Letters from the Rose Garden,\\" \\"Controlling the Games,\\" \\"A Conversation with Gary Ross and Elvis Mitchell,\\" and \\"Preparing for the Games: A Director's Process.\\" Each one features interviews and conversations with Donald Sutherland, director Gary Ross, and film critic Elvis Mitchell.<br /><br />The complete \\"Propaganda Film\\" which we see segments from in the movie is presented as well. A marketing archive with posters, trailers, and a photo gallery are here, too.<br /><br />The 2-Disc Blu-ray + Digital Copy Edition of \\"The Hunger Games\\" will please enthusiasts of the film and books. We get a great high-definition transfer of the movie and a satisfying amount of special features to give everyone insight into the making of this excellent movie. If you're looking for an entertaining yet mentally stimulating movie for teens and their parents alike, this will hit the spot and encourage them to discuss the themes explored in the film..<br /><br />Five featurettes with varying lengths are found as well.

1402210086|5.0|What fun this book was. It was very long. Kept me in suspense for a very long time. I just couldn't figure out who Kitty was going to end up with for sure. Now if I could just remember the cant better it would be easier. Wow, so many cousins with dilemmas, so little time.
B000IKQMFO|3.0|I had just watched Downton Abbey Season 1, and thought I'd watch this movie which I missed when it came out. Maggie Smith was, as usual, fantastic. But I had difficulty understanding some of the dialogue in Gosford Park, (and no trouble when watching Downton Abbey). When I'd rewind it, I still couldn't understand what they were saying, it was so soft and quick.<br />The storyline also didn't compare to Downton Abbey, and I kept trying not to compare them. But it's hard when they take place at the same time and basic setting!<br />I'd have to agree with other reviewers that the plot was a bit predictable and boring. Good to watch on a rainy day when you have nothing better to do.
B007CGRS7I|4.0|a very fun read which helps you to see why it was turned into a movie.  it gives you an uplifted feeling by the end.  I'd like to read more in the shopaholic vein.

1402238843|4.0|I enjoyed it tremendously. You definitely know who is trying to end up with whom but the way to go about it is a bit of a suspense. I found the last 50 pages or so especially amusing. What to say if you want to end up with a rake! somewhat reformed. I just loved Venetia's attitude and her dialogue was superb. Poor Damerel if he had qualms before he finds a way to overcome them......after all how many times can a person possibly be interrupted trying to propose?
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the movie, but not the fact we have to wait for pt.2<br />It would have been alot better if all 3 books were made into<br />1 movie.
0307959856|3.0|I enjoyed this but I had a hard time following some of it. It was a bit disjointed for me. I did like the characterizations presented. It was a whole new way of looking at Colonel Fitzwilliam I wasn't sure I liked that. There wasn't much about Georgiana. And what a surprise about who is found dead at Pemberley, who's accused of the murder and who actually committed the crime. I kind of thought I knew who did it but not why. And fresh starts for some of the original P&P minor characters.
0439023491|5.0|This book was an excellent sequel to Suzanne Collins first book in the Hunger Ganes trilogy. Can't wait for the movie!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|1st book was a bit racey, but the 2nd book Fifty Shades Darker was more of a love story.  It was light fun reading that I couldn't put down.  Once I finished it I couldn't wait to get the 3rd book to finish the triogy.<br />Didn't hurt that everyone else in town was reading the same thing, so we compared and discussed the book quite a bit.<br />If your looking for light, easy reading that requires no more that than, WOW who does that, then this will be a good book for  you
030758836X|5.0|On Nick and Amy's 5th wedding anniversary, he wakes to the sound of his wife making him breakfast.  However, what should be a happy day is clearly anything but.  There are cracks in this marriage, some which are immediately apparent and some which the reader will learn over time.  Nick heads off to work, but a call from a neighbor summons him home - only to find evidence of a struggle and no sign of his wife.  Amy has disappeared and Nick is the police's no. 1 suspect.  The community rallies, her family descend, everyone in town seems to be missing Amy - apart from Nick, who seems strangely detached from the entire affair.<br /><br />This is a terrific, can't-put-me-down thriller with several dramatic twists to keep the reader on their toes.  Try not to find out too much about the plot because you'll enjoy it far more if you don't know where it's headed.  It's very cleverly written: lots of incidental throwaway lines early on end up being integrated back into the plot.  I did feel that the ending was a bit of a letdown but that's partly because the first three quarters are so good.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Linwood Barclay, Harlan Coben, Gregg Hurwitz or Elizabeth Haynes - welcome to your new favourite book.  I absolutely devoured this - the best thriller I've read all year.

B008QE9VJI|1.0|ANY MOVIE FROM A-Z! Stick to creating your own stuff and stop leeching and perverting other peoples visions and creations. Did you not see House of Dark Shadows? A step down from the series but it was Barnabas as originally envisioned by Curtis. A dissolute vampire who comes back for his love and has no remorse in murdering his whole family. Barnabas thru pure butchery destroyed his own descendants in his attempts to find his Josette. Running time about 95Minutes a little longer then your film and even with 10 minutes that never made it to the film and that Curtis destroyed. That could have a starting point and then you could have added your Burtonesque quirks. You couldnt even do that. You and Depp had to have your Keystone cop approach. Stupid, humorless. Stay the F away from others films.
B006AN78XS|3.0|Truth be told, I discovered this movie looking at the list of movies that Tom Hiddleston is in. However, I did not watch this movie just because he was in it. The concept of someone idolizing a different time period wishing that they could have lived then is a fascinating idea. The conclusion that the main character comes to is a decent one, but there seems to always be an air of hopelessness to it.<br /><br />On a side note, there is absolutely no reason that this movie had to be PG-13. They could have made this so much cleaner without compromising storyline or tone.  And I am not talking about the smoking. Why, seriously why?
B002VE36YU|4.0|The movie had some decent highs, but some silly choices in scenes brought it down slightly. I would recommend it just to check out a borderline mystery movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app so much!  The alarm clock that I had broke, so I was really excited when I found this app.  The best part is its free!
0739356135|5.0|I tried reading this book on numerous occasions, but could never get into it.  A Children's Librarian suggested I listen to it on audio.  What a difference!<br /><br />The narrator, Simon Jones, brings Bartamaeus to life.  In the audio version, the footnotes are embedded in the text - so there isn't that awkward gap when reading the story.  And the humor...I couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />This is a story best read outloud.<br /><br />Thank you Stroud and Jones for bringing me a weekend full of laughter.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|When looking for a case for my Kindle Fire I wanted something that would protect it from nicks and scratches while it is in my purse, backpack and just laying around. The case feels sturdy and after being dropped it didn't pop out of the case or anything. I would definitely recommend this to somebody just looking for a little extra protection.<br /><br />Something that I don't like about it is that you can't stand the Kindle up vertically with this case unless you are on a flat hard surface but it that isn't a deal breaker for me.
0143119680|5.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting when I picked up this book, but it definitely wasn't what I got. Deborah Harkness wowed me with her debut. It was simply one of those fabulous reads that I wanted to devour, but instead found myself savoring everything that was going on. It's a story that's part adventure, part mystery and one part a uniquely crafted paranormal historical read. I loved the story's fascinating mix of intrigue, rich history, exciting paranormal elements and it's good old fashion romance.<br /><br />You guys know how much I love well crafted, intriguing, complex characters. Deborah's protagonists, Doctor Diana Bishop and centuries old vampire/renowned scientist Matthew Clairmount fit that bill perfectly! These two took intrigue and complex to a whole new level. The fact that these two were so highly intelligent added to their over all character appeal for me. They weren't intelligent in the \\"I have no idea what you're talking about\\" way, but in the wow, Deborah really had her work cut out with these guys. They were times I felt like I was sitting in on their conversations vs reading about them. It was refreshing for me to read about characters who have intellect, as well as history smarts.<br /><br />Witches, Vampires, and Demons oh my! There's a lively cast of paranormal favorites here, or more like classic paranormal favorites. I felt like Deborah really did her homework on these characters and I enjoyed the own unique spin she gave each of them, which made for some authentic characters. Each character gave something back to the story. It also added some fabulous tension between Diana, who's a witch and the vampire Matthew. We all know witches and vampires don't go round holding hands and hanging out all the time together, but there's something these two offer each other aside from help and looking for answers they're both in need of. I loved the chemistry these two have. It's hot, complex and sometimes a little comical.<br /><br />Aside from the characters I really loved this story's setting. Oxford was the perfect setting for this book, and I felt like it fueled some of the story's overall appeal for me. I also enjoyed this story's over all plot line. It was highly engaging and kept the over all story entertaining and engaging for me. Sure there's a few moments where it's a little slow, but the majority of the story just flows. One of the things I loved about Deborah's writing was how descriptive it was. Normally I would have said it was a little over done, but it really worked with this book, because there's so much to this story's rich history and historical setting. I felt Deborah's attention to details, both little and big went along way in this book.

Oxford was the perfect setting for this book, and I felt like it fueled some of the story's overall appeal for me. I also enjoyed this story's over all plot line. It was highly engaging and kept the over all story entertaining and engaging for me. Sure there's a few moments where it's a little slow, but the majority of the story just flows. One of the things I loved about Deborah's writing was how descriptive it was. Normally I would have said it was a little over done, but it really worked with this book, because there's so much to this story's rich history and historical setting. I felt Deborah's attention to details, both little and big went along way in this book.

B002PLALCO|1.0|I love Pink but this seller was very slow! I didn't get the Dvd timely and when I finally played it 1 1/2 weeks after the delivery it would'nt play at all And the return warranty had expired. So no playable Pink Dvd, No recourse and I'm out my bucks
B006RUJST6|5.0|I really enjoyed this story!  It was a quick read and the author did a great job holding onto you and wanting more.  I continued on to read the second book in the series \\"Point of Retreat\\" and I look forward to the next book coming out soon.  Enjoy!

1466401885|5.0|This was a great book set on a college campus. Great love story. It had me sucked in so much that I finished it in two days. Can't wait for walking disaster to come out.
1451673442|4.0|Yep- this book is definitely \\"Life Improving\\" (as apposed to 'Life Changing')<br />Improvement is a much better word to use than Change - because change can be backward; you've gotta be sooo careful what you wish for!<br /><br />So The Magic helps you to wish accurately - so any change can be an Improvement. There are lots of interesting strategies in here to experiment with.<br /><br />I particularly liked the sprinkling of magic over my food before I eat. This just stops you and makes you consider and appreciate all the amazing processes it took to get the beautiful food from the earth to the table.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Reliable, digs out all the stations and can record a program too!  It even has sleep timer for bed time. Lots of other great features too.
1591795230|1.0|That was a couple hours of my life I will never get back. A bunch of Blah, blah, blah about his time teaching in the Caribean, and his epipheny that cells have memory, and absorb energy at a quantum level. Ok, far reaching but we'll go with it. Then comes the addendum: you can unleash the power of your subconscious simply by taking all these \\"psych-k\\" courses for a few thousand bucks. There are multiple levels, beginner, advanced, etc. Each one costing more money. All he needs is an e-meter and tax exempt status to complete things.
0307341577|1.0|I hated this book.  While it was well written, I hated every character.  It was so disturbing.  I felt dirty after finishing it.  So disappointed after reading Gone Girl which I loved!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Ever since Amazon started allowing authors to self-publish I have been amazed at the the quality of some of their work.  I just couldn't believe some legitimate publishing house had turned them down.  This book is a perfect example.  I found the characters well-developed, the story gripping and well-paced and the plot interesting, self consistent and complex enough to keep me guessing.<br /><br />Also deeply satisfying was the length of this book.  No novella this.  Unlike many lengthy novels, I was not tempted to skip over tedious introspective monologues or overly descriptive deep dives into scenery.  Everything written contributed to the story, was necessary to build out a plot element or reveal something more about a character and most fundamentally, was interesting to read.<br /><br />Having said all that, I don't read a book to be blown away by it's tight plot or well developed characters, I read a book to be transported to somewhere else for a while.  To take a break from the world I live in and submerge myself in another place, another time.  This book is a deep, satisfying swim.  Buy it.
B008BM9L72|5.0|The trilogy had me captured right from the first page and many nights turned into early mornings as I kept saying \\"just one more chapter!\\", a great read that was not spoilt by it's most talked about ratings.
0062206281|5.0|This review is also posted at The Bawdy Book Blog.<br /><br />Carlos Ruiz Zafon continues to write amazing, lyrical prose in The Prisoner of Heaven, the third book in the Shadow of the Wind stories.<br />It's 1950s Barcelona and Daniel Sempere is now a man with a wife and a small baby. He's still at his father's bookshop, Sempere & Sons, along with his long-time pal, Fermin, when a stranger walks in one morning, buys the most expensive book in the store, and personalizes for Fermin...from Fermin. What follows next is the unraveling of a story Fermin would like to forget, and Daniel desperately wants to know, so he can better understand his own past.<br />I absolutely adored The Shadow of the Wind. Books about books are captivating and enthralling. The Prisoner of Heaven is no less so, and Zafon manages to capture all the mystery and intrigue of The Shadow of the Wind and expand on his characters and their pasts in The Prisoner of Heaven, while dabbling in a larger touch of humor. When I say that Zafon is a magnificent writer, I mean every word. It is so easy to get lost in his words, and in the pages of his books. He is such an amazingly prolific writer.<br />Have I waxed enough poetic yet?<br />As I said, he expanded on his characters and their stories. In The Shadow of the Wind, I was very intrigued by Fermin. What was his story? He just appeared one day and befriended Daniel, but there was something more to him, I just knew it. The Prisoner of Heaven focuses heavily on Fermin, where he came from and how he got to Sempere & Sons. It's heart-breaking and hopeful, and I felt deeply for him. Here is a man that wants nothing more than to start over, marry his Bernarda and his past at Montjuic and beyond continues to haunt him.<br />And while Fermin takes center-stage in The Prisoner of Heaven, Daniel is not left out. He's still the main character, even if he has taken a back seat to his own story...because this continues to be his story. Everything circles back around to him. He's also grown from the young boy who was enamored with the beautiful, well-read women in The Shadow of the Wind, to a young man very much in love with his wife, Bea, and their young son, Julian. It was wonderful getting to know the adult-Daniel in The Prisoner of Heaven; he's tempered with wisdom and age, but he hasn't lost that boyish charm!<br />His father, Senor Sempere, remains the stuffy older Sempere, but now Daniel can see the wisdom in him. And we, the reader, get to know what's behind that stuffiness: a private anguish at the loss of his wife, Isabella, so many years before and how it came to that.<br />There are other characters in The Prisoner of Heaven that are apparently introduced in The Angel's Game, book two in this set of stories (I'm hesitant to call it a series, because each book can stand on its own rather well). I've never read The Angels Game, and I don't think that it's necessary for this book, although I sort of wish I had, because there are tie-ins to it (characters, books) throughout The Prisoner of Heaven. But I didn't feel lost without it. I saw an obvious opening for another book in the ending to this one, and I'm looking forward to it so much, if not for Zafon's writing, then for the sinister plot I know is to come.<br />If you haven't read Zafon's work yet, I must insist you do so as soon as you can. The Prisoner of Heaven is a beautiful, poetic masterpiece.<br /><br />*This book was provided to me by the publisher in exchange of an honest review.to him.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't want to put the book down. I actually put a flash light under the comforter to read all night! It will leave you on the edge of your seat. The books are very easy to read... You can easily put a face to all the characters of the book. The book will make you laugh, cry, and feel sexy. Don't listen to the critics! Read it for yourself and fall in love with Shades of gray.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The package is great for its value and it is worth it. However, after starting reading, I had some difficulties navigating in the book. For such a huge book with so many charechters, you will need to go back and forth in order to inderstand it perfectly, and in this edition, it is really hard to find the perfect place.
0425263908|2.0|I did not like the way the story begins.  It got interesting in some spots but the bluntness in the beginning threw me off.
0756655307|4.0|This book is thicker, contains more heroes and also helps to sum up the latest batches of the Mavel universe such as the Skrull Invation and the Civil War, for those of us who couldn't follow it directly.  Comparing the original MArvel Encyclopedia side by side with this new one there were some heroes removed, new ones included, new pictures, new names to old faces, and (again) the comprehensive reviews of the latest facits of the Marvel Universe.  Overall I have to say the collection in this book is well worth the price for those of us who like looking up old characters and new ones alike.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
030746363X|3.0|Today's review is on The 4-Hour Body by Timothy Ferriss<br /><br />While visiting a good friend and enjoying a cup of tea, our conversation drifted over to the subject of sex.  Suddenly she started talking about Timothy Ferriss and this fantastic book that he wrote in which there is a section for men to learn how to bring a woman to the big \\"O\\".  Now before you stop reading, give me just a moment.<br /><br />Believe it or not, there are still millions of women who have NOT had one single climax.  This tidbit of information may be shocking to you; it was to me, and it was to Ferriss, so he decided to do something about it.<br /><br />Seeking out advice from sex therapists, doctors, porn stars, and who ever he could get information from, Ferriss was actually taught how to satisfy just about ANY woman in 15 minutes.  How great would that be if true?  I mean, how many times have you been on the very brink of release, only to have your partner move that 16th of a mm to the left, and toss it out the window instead of hitting a home run?<br /><br />So, as soon as I returned home I downloaded the book to my Kindle and looked for the \\"holy grail\\" chapters.  There are even pictures in the book that illustrate exactly how and what to do it!!  Once I was done reading,  I brought my Kindle out to my husband and told him to read the very same chapters.  Now I'll have to do is make time for him to practice what's he learned.  It's a hardship, but it's one I'm willing to suffer.  All in the name of science of course.<br /><br />I can only give this book a 3 star rating at this point.  If it really teaches an \\"old dog\\" a new trick, then I will amend my rating.<br /><br />3 of 5 stars<br />Available at Amazon
B006ORLAPC|5.0|If this is a movie that you want to own on blu-ray, then you've probably been a little aggravated that is hasn't came out on blu-ray in the US.  Further, you might be a little unsure if buying the version of The Good Shephard imported from the Netherlands is worth the risk.  These thoughts were going through my head when I was on Amazon considering buying this version...I mean even though it says it's Region A, it still may not play on a blu-ray player here in the US.  Well, I decided to take the chance and I can tell you it definitely works here in the US.  There are two audio versions...one is foriegn...I think French or Dutch...the other is the original audio in English 5.1 DTS surround sound.  The only down side (and this is trivial) is that there are no English subtitles.  I only say this because I'm a little hard of hearing, so I like to watch movies with the subtitles on.  It always seems there are a few spots in the movie where I can't really tell what the characters are saying and the subtitles keep me from having to rewind to hear it again.  Other than this, this version of the movie is great...perfect picture and perfect sound, not to mention the the movie itself is great.  So if you've been considering buying this, but hesitant because it's an import, then don't worry...you'll be happy you bought it.
145162607X|5.0|Reading this book was almost like reading the Other Boleyn Girl! One of my favorent book but as you read you see these sisters wail they are always trying to be the favorent and one up each other there is more to their story.... The fear and the what if. You watch the story play out between Anne and her older sister from fighting to making up to udder betrail! You also see another side of King Richard from loyal brother to hopelessly in love with Anne to the man who lost faith in his brother and took his sons throne. I love the Cousin War books and can't wait for the next book. I am on the edge of my seat with these books waiting to see how everything plays out and how each charter from each book portrays their own story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fast read takes you into seemingly normal relationship/marriage.  As the book progresses with well written descriptive style, it becomes a mystery of sorts with unusual outcome.  An excellent book.
B000002B5L|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the Fugees!! I have been thinking about this cd off and on for a while now.  I use to have it back in the 90s on cassette tape. The cd came on time and was in excellent condition.  I definitely recommend this cd for those of you who are missing the way hip hop/rap use to be!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app because it helps me with my homework.<br />It also helps me with other things.<br />This app rocks!!!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I bought this DVD series on a whim as I am a huge Holly Marie Combs fan.  But I could not stop watching.  I finished the entire first season in 2 days.  I was so wrapped up in the show I couldn't stop.  It kept me on the edge of my seat guessing who 'A' was/is.  Anyone who came in my house for these two days, like myself, had never seen this show and got into it instantly.  Do not pass this series up.  Sooooo Good, OMG!!!!!!!!!
0345446798|5.0|I now have long chats with my dog all throughout the night because I know what he is thinking.  His subtle quirks or actions are just like complete sentences to me.  I almost feel as if I can read his mind thanks to this book.  This one time, when I was reading this book, I was thinking about my dog and at that very second he walked into the room, winked at me, and gave me a double thumbs up... which was amazing because dogs dont have thumbs!  What a great book!
B000S57KVO|4.0|I first saw the Thomas Crown Affair on DVD about 2002 or so. I was quite depressed at the time,and the film was a good pick-me-up. Much like Last of the Mohicans, it's one of those films where the score and music are both integral to the film,and well worth listening to on their own. The reason I'm giving it four stars (instead of five) is because--as others have noted--it's missing some pieces from the soundtrack. They should release the FULL score and people should be aware of what they are buying first,before they buy.  Fortunately people can play the samples before purchasing. It is still worth my money,IMO but obviously if one of your favorite pieces are missing, then you will be understandably disappointed and should check first before buying.
B008602KQI|5.0|Oh my god!!This,was the best movies i've seen in years!!All the action and adventure was fabulous!!I hope people keep making movies like that!!Thats why i rate this movie,five stars!!!!<br /><br />  Victoria Sueiro

B000KC4LNU|5.0|This is by far Simon & Garfunkel's greatest album. I own all of their records and just now having bought this one, i am still amazed at how great it is. I owned this on CD before but i would definitely recommend buying it on vinyl! Awesome to own!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy this Bible! Very easy to find the exact verse or verses you are looking for. Page marking functions is handy also.
B0000024TQ|5.0|This is by far Simon & Garfunkel's greatest album! Not much more to say really, the album is truly amazing! I would recommend getting on Vinyl though, the sound is alot better!
0156030306|3.0|Charlie is an adult male with learning disabilities, perhaps mild or moderately retarded.  His burning desire in life is to learn and read.  He hears of a research experimental surgery that could possibly make him smarter.  Even knowing it might kill him, Charlie does it anyway.  The reader follows Charlie's struggles by watching Algernon, the mouse who had the surgery first.  Charlie uses him as a measure of his own success and possible outcome.  There is lots of symbolism if you're in to that sort of thing.<br /><br />This book reminded me of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button just a bit. Two people circling around one another, prevented from making a true connection by circumstance, almost able to line up, but in fleeting moments..........The tone and voice of the book was masterful.  How the author switches from speaking as a mentally disabled adult to a near genius and then making it all sound so natural was incredible. It was a sad, but sweet, story.<br /><br />Warning:  This book comes with a sad ending, but of course the reader expects it all along.  It deserves the classic rating.
B00479SVBU|1.0|It worked very well while it did.  It had some static noise but, overall, it sounded OK.  All of the sudden, after a few months of use, it stopped working and never worked again.
B000007ODY|5.0|I particularly like the classical musical compositions of Johannes Brahms and would not hesitate to recommend this particular two CD set to anyone in search of a reasonable, if not actually bargain priced (@ £8.80 inc p&p) version of these four superb symphonies. Incidentally, fyi Nos.1 & 3 appear on disc one and Nos.2 & 4 are to be found on disc two.<br />As others have commented previously, this recording was originally mastered wholly in the analogue domain and is all the better for that. There is none of the 'glassy harshness' that regrettably tended to afflict numerous early digital recordings which were produced during the first decades of that era. I distinctly remember Philips proud advertising boast when CD's first became available of 'perfect sound forever'.....hmmm, we shall have to see about that one....!!!<br />I say this as someone who over the years has had the good fortune to experiment with using numerous expensive and well-respected high-end condenser capacitor microphones, both valve, transistor and some even digital. I cannot for obvious reasons get involved in naming manufacturers, but have a colleague who purchased a pair of fairly well-respected cardioid mic's a few years ago that the makers described as a (so-called) 'improvement' (over the previous outgoing model) with a claimed extended frequency response (at both ends of the audio spectrum) apparently 'suitable to meet the needs of modern digital recording requirements'. However, in a 'side-by-side' comparison with my earlier original microphones, to the ears of those who have heard the two identical 'takes' switched directly between each other, the 'improved'  mic sounds noticeably hard and unnaturally exaggerated. There are clearly good reasons why some classical engineers nowadays still tend to pay thousands of pounds for original vintage valve microphones as well as newer condenser types which are highly revered in the recording industry and for very good reason.<br />My advice wouldbe to simply buy these discs and enjoy them for many years to come.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I know to all my blog followers, I am sorry.. This is not an Indi writer.. but I wanted to read this one really bad. I am a closet Gleek so when I heard that he had written a book I wanted to see what it was about. But what sold me was the story itself. I LOVE the old fairy tale stories. A set of twins that are as different as night and day fall into their family book of the old fair tails that they grew up listening too. This book is about what happens after the story is over, after we hear \\"they live happily ever after, The End\\" In the Land of stories it is a place where all the fairy tales are real and live on in their lives.
B00005ONMP|5.0|This wonderful boxed-set comprises a grand total of 4 CD's featuring Mendelssohn's entire Symphonic output (Nos. 1 - 5), whilst also managing to squeeze in his seven Overtures for good measure. Felix's third Symphony (\\"Scottish\\") and fourth Symphony (\\"Italian\\") are probably the most widely performed pieces nowadays, but nonetheless it has been quite interesting for me to familiarise myself with some of his lesser known works. If you're reading this review, it is likely that you may well be familiar with some of Mendelssohn's more popular Overtures such as \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" or \\"The Hebrides\\" (often referred to as \\"Fingal's Cave\\")  for example, whilst not forgetting to mention \\"Ruy Blas\\" etc. At the time, the London Symphony Orchestra were at the top of their game under the masterful baton of Claudio Abbado and at no point during exhaustive listening sessions to these exceptional recordings can I find fault with the musical interpretations of these works.<br />Incidentally, the recording venues were especially chosen for their renowned acoustics by Deutsche Grammophon's exacting sound engineers and include those found at the respective churches of All Saints, Tooting, S.W. London and St. John's, Smith Square central London, as well as Walthamstow's Town Hall in east London. In all honesty I regard this boxed-set as being well into bargain territory, as each CD only costs about £3.50 which seems like great overall value. Personally, I would not hesitate for one moment to highly recommend these delightful discs to anyone considering the purchase of Mendelssohn's Symphonic output. In conclusion I feel pretty sure that you will enjoy these recordings so go ahead and purchase with absolute confidence.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Use the update from Google Play Store. This claims to be the same exact version as play store, but it's not. No power-ups in this version :( Trust me, I've been through this twice. Not fun. Again, do not use this version!
B00846REIS|2.0|I didn't really believe it during several different moments, plus I thought the language was pretty vulgar during the sensual scenes, unlike Fifty Shades. It is hard not to compare the two. Several aspects of the story were also left unfinished, and disconnected and that bothered me. You keep track of all these things in your mind and then they never really connect. It had a great start and then it kind of stalls... not my favorite.
B007IHH4I4|5.0|one of the best album in the history of rock three weeks before dateline! new product, excellent presentation,excellent package, 120gr vinyl, excellent sound, excellent poetry . 100% recomended.
B005KB0SU6|5.0|I have read all of Zafón's books and this one was my favorite. You see, feel and experience everything that goes on, walking down those mystical streets of an old Barcelona. I enjoyed and savored every page. It is hard to not read it from start to end because the mystery and the complexity of the characters is unparalleled. The characters are so profound and rich that you are able to see the world through so many eyes. Zafón's funny and witty tone adds the finishing touch to a story that is extremely well written. An amazing journey! and one of the best books I've ever read.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was a great book. From the beginning I couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed it and am sad that I've finished it. My only Negitive is that the ending was predictable. Twice towards the end I knew what was going to happen before it did. Although that didn't ruin the story because I was still happy to keep reading.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this book better than the first.  I liked the third book even better than this one.  I'm looking forward to the second movie to come out to see how closely it follows the book.
B004I4H8QI|1.0|I bought the 2011 remaster of Layla based on the Amazon reviews, which suggested an improvement over the 20th Anniversary remix/remaster.  I was sorely disappointed.  Perhaps it is true that this remaster is closer in balance to the original album, but the sound quality is poor - and amazingly so.  There is an audible high frequency hiss throughout the disc, most easily identifiable at the end and beginnings of tracks, which colors the entire production.  Add the overall muddiness and low-end thump, and (believe me) you don't want to listen to this.  I don't know which version of Layla on disc is best, but, for me, this isn't it.  I'll stick with the more pristine sound of the 20th Anniversary edition - remix or not.
0062119044|2.0|I will not give too much away. But, the way the story is narrated is different.  But, the novelty of it does wear off by the middle of the book.  The writing style and attempt to use over-complicated words is a complete fail by this author.  She should have remembered the topic she was writing about: a school shooting.  And, her attempts to make the main character of the book so highbrow, educated and elite compared to everyone else in the novel does nothing more than bore the reader and make the novel seem to drag on. Again, this is supposed to be about something controversial in America today, mass shootings, and more specifically, a school shooting.  The reader will find that the novel really has not much to do with the topic that drew you into reading the book.<br /><br />The biggest problem in this book is not even the highbrow main character or slow moving story that is devoid of any real controversy, but the development of the two supporting characters: Kevin and his father.  Kevin comes off as a super-smart, emotionally devoid robotic clone of a young boy.  The idea that school shooters are clones with little to no feelings, who only look down at the rest of us, is laughable at best, and most likely a pathetic and lazy write by the author.  As for the father, I really couldn't tell you two things about more than he likes football and president Reagan.<br /><br />All in all, like most books that become a huge success and movies, this one was a major let down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE AND I MEAN LOVE THIS BOOK...AND YES I AM TYPING IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE I AM SCREAMING IT!!!!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this was the worst game ive ever played all you get to do is walk back and forth its stupid
B008ENNXQI|4.0|It was a good movie. Very interesting and a wonderful fantasy land.I would definetely recommend the movie to my friends.
B008XM3NZQ|1.0|1 of 0 Stars to Anchor*Media for there outrages overpricing 5 Stars for the film and Digibook its self.  I love Jaws but to pay $84.95 for a bluray digibook That's just Highway Robbery. $25.95 would have been the right price.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I have never read the books, so my review is based solely on the movie.<br /><br />The movie starts out slow.  Some people will call it character building, but there was not much of that.  It was mainly just about training for the \\"Games\\".<br /><br />It was not until the battle scenes that the movie got better.  I love action films.  I grew up in the eighties watching Arnold and Sylvester.  I do not care so much about a plot.  I just want to be entertained.  This part of the movie certainly did that for me.<br /><br />The romance seemed forced and the ending was cheesy.  I won't give it away.  There was enough in this film to keep me wanting to watch part 2 when it comes out.  I think, like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies, the second film will be much better than the first for action seekers like me.<br /><br />I must say that Jennifer Lawrence really has good onscreen presence.  Her personality truly reflects through the screen to the viewer.  I would not be shocked if her career is successful and longlasting.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app. Its extremely useful and I enjoy how it looks. Its nice to just open it up and look at the battery. I made it my favorite color.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Good movie. Most enjoyable and thought provocing when people just want to ignore nature. A great resone to worry about what is happening to the world. With how much we are messing up things A good movie about taking care of the world so are kids can have a life like ours.

I got to try this memory card out in my psp. It work wonderfully. Only downside is where I should have 32GB I Only have 29GB of space. I'm alright with this, as it's not a large decrease and I have 46 Games on my psp now. I would highly recommend this item.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|The album is unlistenable and embarrassing. Perhaps Reed was starstruck by Metallica - and vice-versa - or perhaps they just had a good time hanging out. But the musical product sounds like old men trying hard to sound raw and authentic; they're not; the music is packed with musical and lyrical cliches.
0345803485|1.0|What a load of rubbish! I have never written a book review! But I couldn't resist telling others, THAT THIS IS THE POOREST EXAMPLE OF DRIBBLE WRITTEN!!! I resorted to reading the first 4 words in every sentence to get through it faster! Painfully boring, tediously repedative!<br />I have read better erotica in a penguin book!

0688091717|3.0|It's okay to be different, right? So I'll go against the grain and say that, quite honestly, I found this book a bit boring. So did my four-year-old boy. Perhaps because it is so short and simple? The message is so much in your face? Granted, elephants are cute, and I actually like the idea of one of them being a patchwork of colors, but there's just something about this book that, to me, fails to live up to the hype.

Simply spectacular!
B008S7EPXA|4.0|If you're a fan of DCD's \\"Into the Labyrinth\\", you'll consider this an appropriate continuation album. It's hard to believe that 16 years later, Lisa and Brendan can still make incredibly cohesive music. This album nails every caveat of what Dead Can Dance is currently about: dulcimer, violin, doumbek, and synths backed by haunting vocals. New-age this album is not.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I have been looking for a game like this for years for the android. While this may seem a bit old school for some, I think the positive reviews are well deserved. Well worth the money if you like deep gameplay. no... I'm not dev. just impressed.
B006O7XOOW|4.0|My 7 month old has lots of toys, mostly all from Fisher-Price and by far this is her favorite. I try and give fair ratings for all my reviews and this is a 4 1/2.<br /><br />My daughter started crawling at 6 months and she just turned 7 so her favorite thing by far is holding on to anything that she can and pulling herself up to stand. This Ballcano toy is perfect for that. It's sturdy enough that she can grab onto it and stand up without it tipping over. That alone definitely earned it 4 stars in my book.<br /><br />It comes with 6 colorful balls and she figured out easy enough (after seeing me do it) that when she puts the balls into the center and spins the roller that the balls comes up goes down the sides. She finds it funny and laughs everytime she does it. Not sure if she's too interested in the music, she seems to totally ignore it altogether. She also loves to play with the balls as a stand alone toy.<br /><br />My 7 year old was also interested in this and actually played with it alongside with her. It was a hit with both of them.<br /><br />I must say that it does not come with batteries and requires 4AA batteries so buy some at the same time while buying this.<br /><br />Edit: OK so my daughter is now 10 months and the fun/exciting factor is now gone. She's no longer interested in it and won't even bother playing with it even when given the balls. In my opinion this is perfect for those babies just starting out in their learning to stand phase. The age on this says 6-36 months though so it's all up to the purchaser.
B00843TZJM|1.0|The title of the concert is CSN 2012.  Who releases a blu-ray music concert in 2012 in stereo only.  It's a live concert.  That's what 5.1 surround sound is meant to reproduce for us in our lounge room.  Why rip us off with a stereo mix only?  I've seen CSN live in Melbourne twice recently and loved the concerts.  What a disappointment to find that the whole concert ambience and surround sound has been lost because some cheap-scate sound engineer wanted to save a few bucks and save a few hours to get to the bar sooner.  I notice that there is no marking on the blu-ray packaging or the Amazon website that tells buyers that the sound is 2.0 and not 5.1.  I smell a cover-up.  Can I get my money back?

0375847227|5.0|I wanted to read the book after I saw the movie for The Golden Compass, my sister was kind enough to purchase it for me.  I couldn't put it down once I started- I finished it in about 3 days.  I liked that the trilogy was all in 1 book since I like to back track sometimes.
0743435729|4.0|This was a great action story, enjoyed it very much. There was a lot of action and strategy. A bit too much tactics babble perhaps but overall I enjoyed the story and exploits of Honor. I've been on a binge reading through the older books in the series to catch up. This wasn't my favorite of the stories but it was pretty good.

B007MOU6ZQ|4.0|Interesting and amusingly much more fun to read than most of the products of the culture of positivity that it critiques.  The book does well exploring alternative routes to having a better life (including a discussion about whether \\"Happiness\\" and \\"Success\\" are really what improves our life).  Some of the international tourism was a bit questionable, but overall I really enjoyed the study and particularly (for this book at least) the author follows the core message and never takes himself or his material too seriously.

B003O7I6L6|5.0|I love this movie! One of Carpenters best. Great cast, Great characters, Vary good cinematography and a fantastic 80s synth score! That being said the Blu-Ray itself is far from being up to snuff. Zero extras on the BD and a Trailer on the (flipper) DVD. That's it, Nothing new, Nothing from the now near decade old Special Edition DVD. There is the picture quality, It is OK at best. No major DNR or edge sharpening, It's not bad It's just not upgrade worthy. Maybe it's my fault for not looking into it before I bought it but was I out of line to think I'd be getting something extra in what boils down to a 2 disc set?<br /><br />Also. This may be in my case only as I haven't seen any one else complaining but, The first time I played it the movie skipped and the audio went out of sync in two key parts of the movie. The air-force one scene and the Duke, Snake fight near the end. I fixed the audio by rewinding a bit but the skips happened regardless. I checked the back of the disc and there are no scratches. Not sure if its the disc or not.<br /><br />I rated this 5 stars because the movie is great! The Blu-Ray is simply not. Not one of those reviewers who rate something low because they think it's getting to many positive reviews. Which is why you should get this [[ASIN:B0000CNY27 Escape from New York (Special Edition)]] until they come out with a good BD.<br />Edit: Scream Factory has released a well reviewed set. While I have not bought or seen it personally I can vouch for SF's usual quality [[ASIN:B00S0DW46M Escape From New York (Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]]
1609611543|5.0|I usually don't write reviews for books I download from Amazon, but I am so thrilled with Wheat Belly that I feel compelled to share my experience avoiding wheat.  I am not overweight nor am I diabetic.  However, I am (or was) a slightly paunchy middle-aged weekend warrior.  I exercise several times per week, often jogging 20 miles per week.  No matter how hard I pushed in my workouts, I could never lose the love handles or the belly fat.  It has been a battle for my entire life as I've always been a bit \\"husky\\" or \\"stocky\\", carrying an extra 15 pounds or so.<br /><br />After reading Dr. Davis' book, I dropped wheat from my diet and have tried to keep gluten free.  The first week was challenging. I CRAVED wheat.  I ended up eating a lot of non-wheat based food, just to have something in my stomach.  After the first week, my body adjusted and I find that I eat much less food.  I am NEVER hungry between meals and I often find myself wondering why I should even eat the next meal.  For example, at noon I will go to lunch with my work colleagues, but this is out of custom, not hunger.  I no longer snack between meals, something I used to do often.  I find that I sleep better too.<br /><br />It's been three weeks and I've lost about 8 pounds. I think I have about 7 or 8 more to go to get to a point where I will feel \\"fit and trim\\". I have also noticed a bit more speed in my runs.  This could be because I am lighter but it could also be a feeling of more energy.  In short, I feel great and I look forward to staying wheat free.<br /><br />Lastly, since going wheat free, I find that I look at people on the street and can instantly tell if they are \\"wheat eaters\\".  The telltale muffin top belly hanging over the belt buckle stands out, as does the bubble butt.  I want to go up to them and urge them to change their behavior and break their wheat addiction.  It could save their lives!<br /><br />Hopefully, people will continue to talk about the dangers of modern wheat and we will see a change in American eating habits.l see a change in American eating habits.
0375869026|5.0|If this book doesn't get its own slew of awards this year, there is no justice in the literary world. WONDER is unmatched in the middle-grade contemporary genre--but, in fact, it is not middle-grade so much as it is a winning tale that transcends reading age groups.<br /><br />August Pullman is ten years old and starting school. Previously, he was homeschooled, because Auggie was born with a facial deformity. Auggie, as well as the other people in his life, have mixed feelings about him entering school, but perhaps Auggie will prove to everyone, as well as himself, that with a heart of gold, he can accomplish things beyond everyone's expectations.<br /><br />There are many great things I can talk about regarding WONDER, but my favorite thing about it is how R. J. Palacio successfully uses multiple perspectives to weave together a very full portrait of Auggie and his struggles and triumphs. Palacio treats the story humanly and realistically. Just as in real life, characters are not perfect in this book: Auggie's older sister, Via, struggles with her guilt over her occasional flashes of resentment and embarrassment over her brother, while Auggie's friend Jack learns how to balance social expectations with his personal feelings about their friendship. As readers, then, we might prefer some characters over others, but we cannot hate any of them, because we fully understand where they come from.<br /><br />Auggie, the protagonist, is a character that simultaneously possesses the youthful optimism of the truly good and the observational skills of one who has borne more than he should have to. My heart jumped each time he made an insightful observation on subtleties in human behavior, such as the way he remarks on that \\"one-two look\\" people give him and his face. You know what he's talking about, because you've either received it, or have done it (the latter doesn't make you a bad person, as this book shows). Auggie's narration is so honest and unflinching you feel like you should pity him, but you can't, because he just wants to be a normal boy...only he is too good of a person to be considered just normal. You know how that movie Say Anything has the tag line \\"To know Lloyd Dobler is to love him\\"? Yeah. To know August Pullman is to love him.<br /><br />WONDER is marketed as a middle-grade novel, at least in the US, but I think it can be even better appreciated by older readers who are aware of both the innocent and not-so-innocent actions of children and also how cruel the world can be. Regardless of your age and genre preferences, WONDER will leave you in a mess of strong emotions and have you better appreciating your blessings. Thank you, R. J. Palacio, for reminding us of what it means to be human.u should pity him, but you can't, because he just wants to be a normal boy...only he is too good of a person to be considered just normal.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Hands down, this is my favorite television series of all time. And it's my favorite for many reasons. The writing, the setting, the actors, they're all great and in my opinion, leagues above every other television show out there. Yes, there are sex scenes. A lot of them, but they're real, not like all those shows that just hint at it, and don't show, so get over it. It adds to the flavor. Know that this is a series without cliffhangers. And that's good. It doesn't rely on them. It delivers a satisfying story every episode. It brings that mini story to conclusion, and never drags its feet -- like The Walking Dead tends to do. I'd say if you're reading this, and have seen the episodes or not, do yourself a favor and buy it on blu ray, watch it alone, or with someone who doesn't scoff at sex scenes (a prude) and lastly, put your popcorn in the microwave.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I love this movie. Whenever the topic of shoes or stiletto's gets brought up, I always have to ask if people have seen this movie. I had to order another copy because I keep loaning it to friends. I highly recommend that everyone see this great film!

It works great for keeping up on what bills are due & when.  I would definetly recommend this app to anyone trying to keep up on bills, appointments, birthdays, etc.
0802130208|2.0|good literature? NOT......did not find much humorous about this novel....I think hero may have had Asbergers!<br />Not worth wasting my time reading past the 200 pages I read in hopes it would stop its ridiculousness.
0385737955|3.0|Warning: May contain spoilers!<br /><br />After reading the synopsis and having a fascination with mazes and more recently, dystopian type stories, I decided to purchase 'The Maze Runner'. I'm not going to go in depth of the entire story, but I will write in detail what bothered me and made me downgrade the rating to a 3, maybe a 2.5 star. I am being a bit more generous considering the fact that I felt like I was complaining too much about the entire book. First, the biggest issue was that this book was extremely slow paced. The only reason I kept reading was because it was an easy read. Now by easy, I don't mean a great page-turner. Easy as in the font is big and chapters are quite short. But by 200+ pages, it was getting good and I must say from then on, the book was at least 4 stars. I enjoy the whole survival of the fittest idea, so it got better. If only Dashner could cut the beginning short, then it would have been a much better story. Some details could have been left out. Or maybe just shortened.<br /><br />Second, I didn't like how Thomas was in the beginning and how his character seemed a bit over the top to be credible. Maybe I am being a little picky about this, but overall he is a bit overly emotional and sensitive. Even though it's a plausible reason to be afraid of the box, everything else just isn't that scary. How can someone be afraid of the boys he saw for the first time, after being in a pitch black moving box? If anything, he should feel relieved that he sees kids his age. And I think it's too repetitive to always hear how Thomas had shivers down his spine. He sounds like a really big chicken, completely opposite of the Thomas in the second half of the story. I definitely understand that the protagonist has to be an amazing hero, but that doesn't mean you should make him invincible. It just takes all the fun and thrill away because he's too good.<br /><br />Lastly, I was hoping the description of the enemies (the Grievers) would be a lot more scary and creepy. The problem with the Grievers was that it was part machine. And to me, anything that's part machine is less scary. Sure, if I saw that thing in real life, I'd be scared too. But scared only because I don't want to be cut up and stung, not because I don't understand it. I've always thought, that not being able to understand something is the biggest fear in all of us, and if it was some sort of disgusting mutant, it would be more life threatening and scary. But if it's machine, we all know it could be shut down somehow, someway. Or maybe just the description of the Grievers were not good. Perhaps someone could take this part machine, part jelly thing and actually creep the heck out of me. Not Dashner though.<br /><br />Now on to the few things I did enjoy. As I have said before, the book was good after 200 pages or so. The story picked up and forced everyone to go on fight or flight mode, which made things interesting. There isn't much to go into detail here because everything was kind of expected even though it was supposed to be suspenseful. One thing I particularly liked, which might not be similar to many people's tastes, is that Chuck died in the end. I never hated the guy. I even wished that somehow he magically came back to life, or the woman working WICKED was playing a joke on him, just to see Thomas fall apart. And it was so sad that Thomas couldn't keep his promise. It was a bittersweet scene for me. The reason why I liked it was because it made the book more realistic. Usually in movies and everything else I do, I would like if a very important character, besides the protagonist and antagonist, died. It makes things seems less predictable.<br /><br />One last thing, upon reading the preview for the next book, 'The Scorch Trials', it seemed much more fast paced early in the beginning and the creatures are pretty much zombies. That makes things much scarier and tense. But when I read the reviews for the book, I heard it was going to be slow paced in the second half of the book. And some even say it's best to just skip the second book entirely and go straight for the third. And the reviews on the third aren't fairing any better. So with that, I will probably not read the second and highly unlikely to read the third. It's quite disappointing really. Dashner could've had the perfect chance to make a great sequel, especially with the end of the first and beginning of the second books. Unfortunately, it seems he has a knack for over-explaining details that tends to lead either the first or second half of the book boring.

0143119680|3.0|I should be the prime audience for this book -- I love a richly drawn tale of suspense / intrigue / mystery. And if there are supernatural elements, too, all the better. But like some other reviewers have noted, this book felt like a lot of foreplay leading up to ... an unsatisfying conclusion.<br /><br />I kept remarking that this book felt VERY Twilight-esque. Rather shallow, one-note characters. Lots of FEELINGS, described in angsty detail. But there was more here: Lots of sumptuous meals, explained in mind-numbing detail. Lots of pent-up sexual frustration, explained in ... well, you get the idea. I felt like the book could have been about 40% shorter. Nothing happened, nothing happened ... and then all of a sudden, in the last 100 pages, EVERYTHING happened. We met half a dozen new characters, started off on a big new adventure, and then the book ended. Sequel time!<br /><br />And yet ... I kept reading. Hoping it would get better. It never really did. But for some reason, I'm still kind of compelled to read the next book. I think it's because I'm still kind of interested in the world that Harkness has created, even if I think her characters are dull as dirt. I'd love to see more action, more plot, more story. Maybe Book #1 was all a lead-up to the action that will follow in Book #2? I guess I'm going to keep reading to find out.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|Every once in a while they get it right. Not this time. With so many added and unnecessary scenes it is hard to figure out if they even had a screen play or if they were just winging it on the set. While it is not all bad there is enough to make you shake your head and wish they had called you up and asked for your advice. FX cannot save this film any more than a good guitar player cannot save a bad drummer. When it is bad at a deeper level it stays bad. This franchise has always had a problem with hit and miss films. This one is off target in the plot, consistency of characters, confusing and inconsistent motivation of characters and sometimes it comes down to just adding things because they think we expect certain scenes. No, we want to be wondering what will happen, not predict it as we go along. If you have not seen it you are one of the lucky ones.

0767827902|5.0|The Last Picture Show was left off the first AFI top 100 listing, but it made it onto the 10th anniversary revision, at spot #95. I have to wonder if a reason it didn't make it onto the first list, and barely clung onto a spot in the second, was the near-porn levels of sexuality, which many viewers are uncomfortable with. There are many long shots of multiple women with full frontal nudity, several sex scenes, and much of the rest of the movie's focus is on sexual affairs and situations. I think it's an area that reviewers often find a bit difficult. Intriguingly, we have many movies in the AFI top 100 which are absolutely full of violence and gore. So apparently for some in our world it's OK to portray pain and hurt, but not physical intimacy.<br /><br />The Last Picture Show is a stellar, stand-out movie in a myriad of ways. First, even though this was 1971, it was shot in black and white. That gives its story set in 1951 even more of a \\"faded\\" look, a sense of the colorlessness of the world the characters live in. Their small town in Texas is nearly falling apart around them. They've got a run down pool hall, a cafe with faded walls, and dingy movie house. The high school kids are routinely dismissed by the adults as worthless and going nowhere - which is at its heart a commentary on how the adults feel about their own desolate lives in a place where tumbleweeds literally roll down the dusty streets.<br /><br />The only way to add any interest into their lives is to have sex. Wives have affairs with whatever men they find around. The high school kids have sex with their boyfriends / girlfriends, chase after strangers, fall into affairs with married people, and the cycle keeps going. The adults aren't surprised or shocked at what the kids are doing. If anything they're cynical - it's exactly what they did, and it didn't help life any. They're still stuck in this dying town, feeling despair. One character says he figures that 80% of married couples are miserable. In this town, it seems more like 100%.<br /><br />With so many movies on the AFI top 100 barely having speaking parts for women, The Last Picture Show stands out as having a number of powerful, complicated female characters. Yes, one could say they're all over-sexed, but so are all the male characters here. It's simply a symptom of the town's malaise. Many of the most poignant scenes are between the run-down mother who feels the angst of all she's lost, and her daughter who is feeling trapped in the small town. The mom is trying to prevent the daughter from making the same mistakes she did. The daughter, as many teen girls tend to do, is rebelling against her advice simply \\"because\\".<br /><br />The actors here are amazing. They can tell volumes with the turn of a head or the glimmer of interest in their eyes. This isn't a movie about wild, flamboyant characters. It's about characters who have been weathered and beaten down, but who still try to find that spark of life to go on with.<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that a watcher has to be comfortable with the idea of sexuality to draw in the full power of the movie. There are scenes of a back-seat prostitute yelling at a metally challenged boy who his friends have tossed in with her. There's a scene of a cheating wife crying while her teenaged lover climbs into bed with her. There's the preacher's boy who contemplates molesting a young girl. So much of what this town does to escape its soul-sucking despair involves the raw power of sex. It's the one life-affirming action that most over puberty can take. Clearly it does not always - or even mostly! - bring a solution or joy. But the characters keep trying out of desperation.<br /><br />Highly recommended.n this town, it seems more like 100%.<br /><br />With so many movies on the AFI top 100 barely having speaking parts for women, The Last Picture Show stands out as having a number of powerful, complicated female characters.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|One of my top favorite books and I have read it three times. Abby and Trevor were perfect for each other. Trevor was kind of crazy with a very volatile personality but Abby complemented him. Though she appeared demure, there was an edgy side of her. They epitomized \\"two parts of a whole\\". I was just so drawn into their really intense relationship and can feel the angst when they were apart. Also, Abby was always full of surprises.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This product provides good protection for your Kindle investment.  The cover stays out of the way when you're using it, and protects the precious screen when you're not using it.  It's lightweight design keeps down the size, but still offers more than sufficient protection.<br /><br />The product doesn't use any magnets, but instead relies on an elastic band to keep the cover either in the protective position or the in-use position.<br /><br />The product is capable of propping itself up, but that only works on a stable, flat surface.  Beyond ideal conditions, the propping mechanism doesn't work.<br /><br />Another issue is with the elastic band and children.  I often use my Kindle to entertain my two year old on long car rides.  While the case offers sufficient protection, children may be tempted to play with and stretch out the elastic band.  My child was wearing the thing like a headband and it lost a little bit of elasticity, but is still usable.  It just makes me wish it used magnets like the iPad cases I've seen.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Lightweight<br />- Protective<br />- Doesn't add bulk<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Doesn't use magnets<br />- Propping mechanism only works on flat stable surfaces.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is such a great book with so many wonderful quotes/words of wisdom worth highlighting so you can go back and read them over and over again. The attraction between Lake and Will was immediate and strong. However, the relationship was wrought with challenges and heartbreak. It is definitely an emotional read.
1451627297|4.0|When I discovered that this book is 850 pages long, I almost decided against reading it. Who's got time to read an 850-page book? But I was intrigued enough by the story line - a man who goes back in time to prevent JFK's assassination - that I thought I'd read at least 50 pages, just to check it out. And I got hooked.<br /><br />The book was actually a quick read and once I got into it, I didn't feel hobbled by the length. I did feel, though, that there was way too much detail; the book could have been 200 pages shorter - still the length of two novels - without losing much. But I can't imagine the story being compressed into a \\"mere\\" 300 pages. Still, I ended up skimming a good bit of the middle of the book. And I wasn't crazy about the ending. I felt like the story ended, and then went on for another 50 pages.<br /><br />Despite these \\"complaints,\\" the story mesmerized me when I read it a couple of months ago and continues to mesmerize me. Somehow, it felt real, not science-fiction-y. It turns out, not surprisingly, that going back in time isn't all it's cracked up to be. Indeed, when you try to change the past, you can't help but change the present. Seeing how that played out was gripping.<br /><br />It was also interesting, as well as amusing, to realize all the changes since the 1960s. I don't recall that time period being as relatively primitive as it clearly was. King did a good job of capturing that era, as well as showing the challenges of fitting in and appearing to belong when you've come from the future.<br /><br />If nothing else, this book has made me more receptive to considering other novels that at first glance seem way too long. Clearly, you can't judge a book by its length.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Amazon.com reviewer obviously didn't see this film obviously because there are hundreds of civilian casualties. Awesome film that somehow managed to take the most well scripted action sequences other than the original Predator movie and make them heart-felt. You can certainly feel the differences between the \\"hollywood actors\\" and the \\"active duty actors\\" which certainly lends to the realism effect but robs the movie of a little bit of continuity. Yet for me it was so far above and beyond the hollywood crap pumper movies that are 99% of what comes out anymore that I give it an easy FIVE STARS! Wish I saw this one in theaters as it is a definite theatrical gem that I regret missing.
B003CN5S7C|5.0|Excellent cast, superb storyline.  I'm a big fan of post-apocalypse movies and this is the best one I've seen in a long time.  It's dirty, it's gritty, and it's full of violent confrontations between good and evil.  The fight scenes are terrific and the ending leaves you with a profound feeling that can only be experienced not described.  This is a must see, don't miss out!

B002VPE1AW|3.0|I originally saw this in the theater and I loved it.  The experience was so intense I didn't want it to end.  The special effects in 3D provided a completely immersive experience.  Then I tried to watch it in 2D...fail.  When the 3D illusion is gone, the silliness of it all comes to light.  I mean it was still entertaining, but let's take the blue chick that helped the main character throughout the film.  Initially she is an independent woman of sorts that behaves as if humans are beneath her...by the end of the film she's riding on the back of the main character's dragon Harley like some sidekick cheerleader.  \\"Unobtainium,\\" really?  And the entire scene when the humans take down the tree...yikes; keep the 3D glasses on and savor the experience!

B001FB5634|4.0|This movie does Cormac McCarthy's novel justice!  A story about post-apocalyptic times when a father must push his son to endure the most miserable living conditions while they search for a better life.  It's a dark and gritty film with adult situations that address the choices between good and bad, dilemmas we would no doubt face if the world were subjected to an extraordinary catastrophic event.  If you like science fiction and apocalyptic fiction this film is for you.
1589795474|3.0|A quick example is the section claiming women make less than men and the deck is stacked against them.  They have a table comparing men and women of the same field and their average salaries, what they fail to mention is that very few women have been in those field for any length of time.  Women had just then (at the writing of this book) been getting into fields such as the sciences and business more than they were in the past, so men that had been in these fields and have years of experience make more than women that were just starting out.  Had they looked at men and women in the same fields WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE they would have found that women are paid slightly more than men.  Companies have been doing this for a decade or more now to make sure they don't get sued.  Granted this book is older than that, but besides that point they should compare workers with the same level of experience instead of creating the false impression that the deck is stacked against women.

B008CP6RWU|5.0|Flow is a good game. Flower is a GREAT game. But Journey... Journey is the best game I've played in my life, and I've been playing since the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System in the 1980s. The following review is SPOILER FREE.<br /><br />It's difficult to put into words what exactly makes Journey so special. As the title implies, it's more of an \\"experience\\", and I might even call it a spiritual/digital pilgrimage, as odd as that might sound. I have never before been so captivated while playing a game, so fully immersed, and so interested in what would come next. This accomplishment is even more remarkable when you consider that Journey contains no dialogue (written or spoken), and breaks many of the standard conventions that gaming relies upon.<br /><br />My recommendation for your first time through is to play it in solitude, in a darkened room, preferably with a good sound system, as the music is phenomenal. On the visual side, an HDTV is a must, and the larger the screen, the better. This is an incredibly immersive experience, and the more you can focus on it, the more you will get out of it. On subsequent playthroughs, it's fun to watch a friend play, and take joy in their reactions to the wonders they experience.<br /><br />Journey contains an orchestral soundtrack that is breathtaking, and fits the game perfectly. The visuals are equally spellbinding, and they become more and more fantastic as your journey progresses. Photos do no justice to the feelings that Journey's sweeping landscapes will evoke in you.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of Journey is that it can be completed, from start to finish, in a mere two hours. This means that going back and revisiting this incredible experience is relatively easy, even for those of us who are pressed for time between jobs and real world responsibilities. Journey can be played any evening after work, and it's fantastic to revisit its immersive, therapeutic, and breathtaking world. Making this game short was not a mistake, but a stroke of genius. There is no bloat, and every minute spent in the experience is finely tuned to provide maximum enjoyment, emotional stimulation, and thought provocation.<br /><br />I downloaded each of these games as they were made available on PSN. Therefore, I do not own the physical copy, so I cannot comment on the packaging or the bonus materials. My review is strictly for the content of the games themselves, and I give this collection my highest possible recommendation.was not a mistake, but a stroke of genius.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I use a laptop with not so great audio output and a very average set of headphones to watch streaming movies and old TV shows.  Very frequently I had a hard time hearing what was being said when the volume dropped, even with the volume all the way up and audio settings optimized for headphones.  I opted to buy this instead of high end headphones and after the first use I am extremely glad I did.  Not only was this much cheaper than high end headphones, but the sound was amazing.  Not only can I now hear everything without problem, but the sound quality is so much better.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to improve the audio output to your headphones.

Good thing is I downloaded it for free from my library. Mills and Boons series are any day better than this series. Every chapter in this book has to have atleast 2-3 sex scenes. I dont know how they have energy to do anything else. Maybe that is Christian is always insisting Ana to Eat.<br /><br />This series will be made into a movie. Holy C****. The director has to maybe shoot 5-10 scenes and all he has to do repeat it throughout the movie.
0812993292|5.0|As the work of an established master novelist, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry will not disappoint.  That it is the first novel Rachel Joyce has written makes it nothing less than spectacular.  Harold Fry, retired and aging, a man whose son committed suicide and whose marriage has become mired in silent grief, receives a letter announcing that a former colleague at the brewery is dying of cancer in the north of England.  He writes a reply and leaves the house to put it in the mail box.  But he passes the first box, and then the next and the next, and he keeps on walking.  The book traces his journey, his pilgrimage, his odyssey, as he walks north, toward the town where his old friend lies in a nursing home.<br /><br />Harold's circumstances tap into a rich tradition in Western literature. It should come as no surprise to the reader that Harold has an epiphany, that he transforms himself, and that he is joined on his journey by pilgrims whose motives for walking are less pure and less spiritual than his.  The true wonder of this book, however, is the beauty of the prose--incandescent, filled with fresh insights, economically expressed, in language amazingly evocative of Harold's world.<br /><br />Joyce has fine insights into people and things. The woman pulled her hand away from his, \\"then she smoothed her skirt, as if Harold were a crease and she needed to brush him off.\\" On another page: \\"His shirt, tie, and trousers were folded small as an apology on a faded blue-velvet chair.\\" And with fine humor and irony: \\"'My aunt had cancer,' she said.  'I mean, it's everywhere.' She cast her eyes up and down the shop shelves, suggesting it was even to be found tucked behind the road maps and Turtle Wax polish.\\"  And again: \\"The hiking man continued talking.  It occurred to Harold that he was one of those people who didn't require other people in order to have a conversation.\\" Or--just one more!--\\"Sometimes it struck him as strange that he had worked all those years with alcohol, when it had played such a terrible part in his life.  Maybe people were drawn to what they feared.\\"<br /><br />The author loves her characters, rejoicing in their humanity while smiling at their foibles and wincing at their pain.  For me, Rachel Joyce's handiwork recalls less the work of Helen Simonson (Major Pettigrew's Last Stand) than that of Penelope Fitzgerald (Offshore, The Blue Flower, At Freddie's), who, like Joyce, wrote luminous fiction using words as if she were the first person to put them on paper. Don't miss this book.  If you feel sad upon turning the last page, then like me you can simply start over at the beginning.h alcohol, when it had played such a terrible part in his life.

I think mac products are engineered very precisely and third party devices just aren't up to the same standards.  Just use eneloop or other rechargeable batteries and save your money.  Nice idea, but poor execution.
0893860468|5.0|Of a dozen or so books I have read on the philosophy of dualism none comes anywhere closer to \\"I Am That\\"--a collection of talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. He does not propound any intellectual concept or doctrine. \\"Simplicity and humility are the keynotes of his teachings.\\" In his down-to-earth style he guides the seeker on a journey to discover his real self. His advice is simple and direct: \\"To know what you are, you must first investigate and know what you are not\\" (p. 51); \\"Happiness comes from the self and can be found in the self only (p.18); \\"The seeker is he who is in search of himself\\" (p. 280).<br /><br />The entire book is full of gems like these. The new edition of \\"I Am That (ISBN 9780893860462) is beautifully printed. Each of the 101 chapters begins with a quote of Maharaj which sets the tone of the dialogs in that chapter. I would recommend this edition whole-heartedly to the students of Maharaj.

Sure, after purchase, I read the editorial description and became aware of the copyright situation. And I also noted that the collection is sometimes referred to as \\"Works of D.H. Lawrence,\\" which might have been a clue. Caveat emptor, I suppose. But I do not feel that one should need to ferret out all the details when purchasing a Kindle book. I would like to feel confident that something labeled \\"Complete Works of\\" was in fact the complete works of a particular author.<br /><br />Does Delphi indulge in this little shell game with any of it's other collections?<br /><br />Also,  the description states: \\"Once the missing texts enter the public domain, they will be automatically added as a free upgrade for our customers.\\" I wonder how that will happen.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|I started Feast of Crows with much trepidation after reading the other reviews. I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed the slower pace of this and A Dance with Dragons. I liked the more detailed background of the minor characters. I felt more connected to the story lines. I especially enjoyed the Cersei chapters and celebrated her comeuppance. I think the slower pace was necessary after the third book. It is possible that a reorganization of the chapters of all five books might make for a better and less confusing story line, but overall - I am still enchanted and awaiting the sixth chapter of the saga. I recommend ignoring the negative reviews and approaching the fourth and fifth books with an open mind - you might be surprised!
0345803507|1.0|The endless pages of Christain and Ana's lovemaking was a bit much! Once or twice in a novel is enough.  Seriously, all three books could have been combined into one.
B007SGM084|1.0|I found these books to be juvenile and insipid.  It reminded me of my youth reading \\"The Wolf and The Dove\\" type books.
034580404X|5.0|I never read and I read all of these in less than a week.  I have already read them twice.  Absolutely love them!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Quite entertaining. I am addicted.  I play it several times a day.  The graphics are nice &amp; it's easy to catch on.  My 6 year old is waiting on the 1st chance to swipe my kindle so that he can play it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Don't start reading this book!  Just don't!  I was totally sucked in after reading the sample.  Yes, it is a page turner with lots of twists.  But for the time invested in reading, the ending is... poor.  Poor plot.  Poor resolution.  Poor character revelations.  Just POOR.  I am ok with a book that does not reslove everything or maybe leaves you with some questions - that is NOT the case with this book.  After all the detail in the first three quarters of this book, the end is rushed, unbelievable and completely unsatisfying.  If you feel you want to read this book, put your name on your local library's list.  Read it for free.  Don't waste the money to buy it, but even worse is wasting precious time reading it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love playing this and just zoning out. Very fun challenging and addictive. Try to beat all the objectives! I cant get the last couple.
0345803485|5.0|If you loved the movie the Secretary and The Story of O, this series is for you. Parents please don't hate on this work of genius. Control what your children read. This is a very graphic series and not for teenagers.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|its awesome. nothing else is better than this get Pandora and the waterfall goes great with sertain songs even baby lullaby also get your mom to massage you its great for that to.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This purchase was a gift.  The person who received it absolutely loved it and cannot wait for the next season to become available and hinted it would make a great Christmas gift.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Marioooo.! Awsomeeeneeessss I cant wait for more games like this@_@it so fun how you shoot acorns instead of fire balls.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|amazing game I had hours no days of entertainment it was so fun you have to avoid obstacles and missles while the game get faster and faster you can collect coins and buy stuff like new jetpacks and more NOT A PORT OF ANY KIND!!!!
B000I52LUO|5.0|This movie is a psychological thriller, and definitely one of Christian Bale's best movies. The main character hasn't slept for over a year, and as the movie progresses you are given many subtle clues that you can use to try and figure out what this guy's big secret is. It makes you wonder if he even knows what is tormenting him and causing his insomnia.<br /><br />The movie has a great ending where all of your questions are answered and your jaw will be left hanging there while you try to wrap your mind around what you just saw. Stop reading reviews and watch this movie before you find out key parts of the plot. This movie will me much more enjoyable going in with a clean slate.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Having being introduced to the Jack Reacher character by my brother I have been hooked on him ever since. This book was downloaded onto my kindle whilst in France on holiday and was the perfect addition to relaxing on the beach. In fact it caused me to get sun burn as I couldn't put it down. It has all the usual fast paced action as well as linking some of the other characters from previous books giving you an insight into their background story. Well written and has kept me engaged as a fan of Lee Child!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Ordered this last Wednesday for $9.99 prime shipping though earlier in the day it was around 12.99-13.22 like it is now.  It works as described so I saved in not having to order another second charger... I might order another one of these again as I have two 85w chargers for my MacBook Pro and the 45w for my MacBook Air.  Happy with what I got, now just waiting for the 9.99 price to come back.<br /><br />Update:  It's Saturday a week later and it's $9.99 again so check back now and then to get it at this price if you're not in a rush.. I just ordered another one.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I ordered this controller from Amazon.com for use with my Acer Iconia A500 with ICS. I was really excited to get started having some real fun gaming on my tab. In choosing whom I should buy the controller from I noted the numerous complaints about the fake controllers being sold. On the online forum as well, many persons experienced in this issue indicated that the fake controllers do not work. Keeping this in mind I tried to choose my vendor carefully. Eventually, I selected one whose items were fulfilled by Amazon (Limmited Distributions), thinking that Amazon would only associate so closely with demonstrably reputable vendors! I received my controller but before I could try it out, I had to leave the country on business. After trying unsuccessfully for a couple days to get the device working, i used an app on my tab to detect usb devices and it showed up as a \\"GreenAsia\\" device. It dawned on me then that despite my precautions (in retrospect very meagre ones), I had received a fake. I looked over the controller but couldn't find any proof of this. Until that is I looked at the back label. It is very plain and sparse just like the pics of the fakes other persons have put up. The real controller has FCC ID, the FCC symbol,patent info, UL listed accessory info etc, none of which appear on the device I received. I am out of the country and will not be back for quite a while so it is inconvenient and expensive to return this fake now.<br /><br />The moral of the story is BUY THIS AT YOUR OWN PERIL! Note that even though the item was fulfilled by Amazon it was still a fake!
B000BFNAYC|5.0|Works very well, simple to use and effective in blast cleaning concrete and brickwork and metal surfaces back to bare metal. Works with sun dry bricklayers sand which is much more economical than buying kiln-dried sand. Uses a fair bit of sand so think before you spray around indiscriminately to avoid a mess.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've ever read.  It's a murder mystery with a very interesting twist.  And once the twist is discovered it spirals on and on and has you tripping over clues you've missed along the way.  The book is a wonderful F-you to men in this world.  It's a definite must read!  There's a reason it's #1 right now!!
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|An amazing album, everybody is a virtuoso in this line up!!! The track 1 \\"New Year\\" is an anticipation of how great the other songs are. I'm just praying for them to record another one, or at least a live recording from the current tour.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|A must-have for every Metal fan.<br />The album kicks ass from start to finish, full of freshness and vitality. The guitar and drum work are fantastic. Chuck Billy sounds better than ever and the bonus trax are awesome.<br />Buy it now and support the band!
B008FOB124|5.0|Anastasis is another wonderfully balanced selection of music compiled by Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry of Dead Can Dance. I am very pleased that Amazon has this CD available for other Dead Can Dance listeners to enjoy.
B0011BBA2E|3.0|Way over way under way beside way gone way bologna way micrometer way subtrahend way extemporaneous way incredibly way past it.
B001FZ0A7W|5.0|Dead Can Dance's Into the Labyrinth is a unique blend of what I call world music, as each piece seems to be taken from several sections of the world, giving homage to those areas that may not otherwise be able to share their own creative music. Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard's voices blend beautifully together.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely love the 2nd book.  You get hooked at the end of the first one so you have to get the 2nd.  It is a wonderful love story and I have gotten so involved with the people in the book that it almost seems real
0785152458|4.0|When I fist heard that they were making a movie of the fist comic book in this series I had to get it. So when the second one came out I was there when it came out. This is a pretty good squeal, although I found it was shorter than the last but still good none the less. The art work is stunning nice bold colors, good shading all that good stuff. I felt the story little too fast paced but it doesn't take away over all. I would pick this up if your a fan of  the series.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|havent played in awhile, but wat i have played it seems to be an ok app.....I'm gonna play it now to refresh my memory
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is so easy to use! I am so glad they made an ap for it! The interface is great. It is still a bit slow to pin items. But, it does work.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun to play. no trouble with it so far on my kindle. a fun waste of time
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|-cant put this game down my husband is jealous of this game he said I like it more then him he might be right lol
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Kids can't stop playing it!  they want to build everything so fast.  But they have so much fun feeding and breeding!
1451648537|5.0|I got completely caught up in this biography. The writing and the subject matter were both so compelling, I didn't want the story to end! I found myself thinking I was getting closer to understanding this very complex man, but it seemed the more I read, the further away I got from knowing what it was that drove Steve Jobs to accomplish so much, and equally important, what drove him to harbor such deep resentments. I think I'll read this book again - it was almost too much to take in in one go!
B000ZP6MIY|5.0|VERY EASY TO WEAR AND KEEP CLEAN. SUPPORTS MY FEET WHEN WALKING OR SITTING STILL. LOOKS GREAT ON OR OFF MY FEET!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Add a refresh button because even if you turn the brightness down it makes no difference as far as how much time your battery has left. But everything else in the app is very well done.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Fun game where you play match 3 games to earn money to buy fish, decorations for tank and supplies.  first few levels are free play then you need to unlock for full version.  Unlock has been fixed and is working.<br />No issues on kindle fire.
0345536886|2.0|I gave up on Grisham having been very disappointed in his last three or four books. These latest works grabbed you right in the beginning and then continued like a rocket straight downhill into total disappointment. I read the reviews of The Litigators and decided to read it because of the popular ratings. Don't bother. The book does not grab you at the start, the story is ho-hum and the final courtroom scene is so obvious. It has good character development and nothing more. John Grisham must be getting paid front end and have to produce something to satisfy the publisher.
B001AL41AI|5.0|It was after purchasing this lovely album that it really occurred to me just how much fun and how well-written these songs are! My love for Billy was pretty well cemented, after thirty years of being, when I got my dance on to Dancing With Myself. Which, quite ironically, I danced to with a room full of my closest friends. All but one I'd just met that night. But I digress... sure enough, the album contains, to my knowledge, all of Billy's big singles over the years (years!), as well as -- lest I'm mistaken -- a few fresh tracks. Previously unreleased. There's a tasty mix of the aforementioned songwriting, vocal stylings, and instrumentals at play here; some tracks might have a distinctive 80s flavor to them, but doesn't that just add to the charm all the more?<br /><br />This download is at such a bloody reasonable price, that if you can afford to album-shop regularly, why not score it for yourself? Go forth, listen, love, and think of the ring-pulling scene from White Wedding.<br /><br />Yeah, I went there. <3
B0052RDHTM|1.0|Seriously???  This is OUTRAGEOUS for a Kindle price!<br />Penguin Publishers - what are you thinking?<br /><br />I love Ken Follett's other novels.  If this item was appropriately priced for an E-Book - you'd have me hook, line & sinker.  I'd purchase all books in this series.<br /><br />But at $18.99 - I feel ripped off.  Digital content should NOT be more than the physical book, and I can purchase a new HARDCOVER edition for $15.99.<br /><br />I urge you to rethink your pricing strategy.
0679777547|2.0|After reading 4 other books by this author, I am very disappointed by The Club Dumas.  It is not up to his past standard of story telling.<br /><br />Got about 100 pages in and I figure there was only about 15- 20 pages of story and the rest all extremely detailed bibliographies or footnotes from reference books. So many details - where's the story???
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've been waiting a while for a good pinterest app for android (specifically my kindle fire). Most others were just a shortcut to the mobile site in the browser or poorly designed and buggy. Great job to pinterest for releasing an official app for android. Now if we can only get facebook to do the same.
0767811070|4.0|I can imagine thousands of stories like this must take place in the hood. So so sad. It makes me sad to see it on screen but I think it's an important story. Black men without fathers, single mothers raising their children, crackheads and drugs in the neighborhood, police helicopters circling overhead, drive-by shootings taking place, black men going in and out of jail, early teenage pregnancies, neighborhoods with trash everywhere...just not the way to live.<br /><br />There was one part in the movie that was a little weird though...when Tre's father starts talking about how gun shops and crack is brought into black neighborhoods b/c society wants them to kill each other.....that was just too conspiracy-theory.<br /><br />The ending is so sad.
0985114606|2.0|I was very exited to read Bared to You when a lot of the reviews said \\"if you liked Fifty Shades of Grey you will love this book.\\" I LOVED the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy so much I re-read them back to back! I purchased Bared to You with high expectations and it turns out...I was very disappointed!<br /><br />I read almost the whole book in one day because I really wanted to like it but I just could not get the connection with the characters. It needed to go more into detail the longing for each other. I didn't feel the desperation of need between the characters. I kept telling myself to stop comparing it to the Fifty Shades of Grey books but it was hard because they were so much alike.<br /><br />It was so frustrating also that they never finished the story!! SPOILER ALERT! They never actually told the story of what happened to HIM?? Okay yes, something happened and basically we know what but not when, who, etc. So annoying! She introduced characters and made them a big deal in the book but then never finished telling what happened to them? If it was not meant to be concluded she should not have wasted half a chapter talking about them! The book needed to be longer so the characters could be more written in detail or take all the dumb stuff out like all the big deal about the karate/defense stuff out because it was POINTLESS!<br /><br />The ending was the frosting on the cake! REALLY that's how it ended. UGH! Just thinking about it makes me mad that I wasted my time.<br /><br />It really had the potential to be a good story even with all the similarities of Fifty Shades of Grey because that is why I bought it! I wanted something similar! But it didn't live up to its potential and lacked a story line and character building.<br /><br />I really hate writing reviews because to each their own but this book was so frustrating!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Took a while to read 1st book 4 days to read book 2&3 .<br />Good love story .<br />Waiting for more
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game with nice visuals!!I catch myself playing it for longer than I had expected just trying to go further.Very fun!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I totally love this! very addicting! I could play it all day. its harder than it looks tho Lol I was surprised
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Wirh the Sherlock Holmes craze going on now on film and TV, it has been great to read the real thing. Thank you.
1469984202|5.0|Like most people writing book reviews, I read A LOT.  I also travel for work quite a bit, so it gives me time to read.  I'm always on the search for great titles and happily stumbled upon Wool.<br /><br />It was so good that I read the entire Wool-Omnibus Edition on a single 14 hour flight from Hong Kong, back home to San Diego.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any of the details and spoil it for you.  Essentially, imagine if everyone had to live underground because something drastic had happened to the world.  Generations of humans living underground, but don't know their history.  The book centers around 1 character's search for those answers and the truth.<br /><br />The author has a wonderful writing style that is fast paced and will keep you engaged from page to page.  Compared to what I have spent on other books that weren't half this entertaining, $5.99 is a steal!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|An unusual but effective way the author has adopted to get the anti war message across.  I found the story interesting and educational concerning the bombing of Dresden.  I thought the author was very successful in highlighting the fact that mass killings can be achieved by bombing without the use of a nuclear bomb.<br /><br />This book is a very good read.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|look just because u dont like him doesnt mean u have to tell the world that. if justin sees this i want u to know that i dont think anything they said is true. i thing u are a normal kid who had a dream and it came true... but your not a rich kid... well i no u have alot of money but u earned it. i love u justin cant wait to read the book!!!! &#60;3
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I purchased this book based on what I had heard on TV.  However, I found it to be boring and not very titillating.  I could not recommend it as a good read
B005IQZB14|4.0|I read this for my book club and was very pleasantly surprised how much I liked it.  From the first page I was laughing and curious for what was coming on the next page. It was the perfect book to enjoy while on my vacation.  I highly recommend this book.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|This gun is about one thing, firing off a lot of darts in a short period of time. At capacity, this gun holds 144 darts (8, 18 dart clips). The downside of this capacity is accuracy. It's not as accurate as some other nerf guns, but when you can fire off 144 darts pretty quickly, accuracy doesn't really matter!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|awesome game easy to pick up and hard to put down simple controls and upgrades for your character and your your army makes this a fun game
031237674X|3.0|If you are interested in reincarnation you might be interested in this book, Life Before Life. I like to read stories by people who can remember a previous life. I think the author tried to reinforce the actual examples with too much information about why some believe in previous lives and those who don't. But on a scale of 1 - 10, I would be comfortable with an 8. If you like to read the pros and cons then this is your book.
B0034KZE9U|3.0|I have had several pairs of these shoes and convinced my boss to buy several pairs for other workers. As they started coming in we had several problems with the size 7 shoes being two different sizes. the left would fit properly and the right would be to small. We are having to sent back all the size 7s (to Amazon) and order from a different place hoping they will be different. On the other hand all the other sizes have been fine and the pair I am wearing now (size 8) I have had for 2 years and are still holding up. Great shoe if Amazon would get their act together.
B007SGM084|1.0|diappointed and upset i spent the money on this. as your ready u can guess whats going to happen next. no depth or shockers in this book. written for the supid hopeless romantic.
B008WU02HG|5.0|I love Man&aacute; and this includes all of their hits (including recents, e.g. 'El Verdadero Amor Perdona') and other great singles. The sound on every song is great. Do your ears a favor and get this! 'Labios Compartidos\\" is my all time favorite from this band.
B008GOAFBQ|2.0|I have been a fan since BEFORE the original release of this album. To \\"remix\\" it and market it is a travesty against the fans of this band who (me included) shell out the bucks for damn near anything with a KISS logo. I still remember the horror I felt when I first heard the \\"remix\\" of Detroit Rock City without the car crash and the poorly dubbed in \\"Get ups\\" and \\"Get downs\\" during the symphonic guitar solos.<br /><br />Hollywood has gone so far down the rabbit hole that they now resort to remaking moderately good films from the 80s (Total Recall? Really?) because nobody can be original any longer. There comes a time when the fans need to draw a line in the sand. Maybe this is it. You want to give me a NEW Destroyer? Re-record it with the current line up. Let Tommy and Eric sing a couple of tracks (Flaming Youth and Beth maybe). But STOP SCREWING WITH MY MEMORIES!
B008M36ER0|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be outstanding and very entertaining. The comedy wasn't there like the previews led you to think, but it was still great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so good I could not put it down!!!!!!!!!!! It held my attention from the first page and such an awesome read!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|new update a month ago required uninstalling, which erased 3 star streeks I had going. Worked my way back up. Now this update says it needs to reinstall. Not falling for it twice. Really hoped this update would have fixed the earlier problem with the android/kindle fire.
B008MEM24S|3.0|this game is ok it is not realy what I thought it would be like but its still a cool game
B005HSG3U6|1.0|Pros:<br />- Fits my Kindle Fire perfect<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Feels cheap compared to the iPad cases<br />- Closing with a strap feels backwards<br />- Does not stand up well at all
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read book 1 and was instantly hooked to Ana & Christian. Book 2 had me falling in love with Christian and wishing he was real...now Book 3 has me completely over the both of them. I cant even finish it, thats how boring Book 3 is. There is no excitement, only sex sex sex...Thats good and everything, but come on, I need more excitement than that. Its so repetitive. Its so Blah...not worth reading twice or once for that matter.
0307272702|5.0|If you're like me and you hear something new or different about what foods are healthy and will help you cut fat every day, then this book is for you. Just read the first 10 pages, this book will PERMANENTLY CHANGE THE WAY YOU EAT FOOD FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game love it been playing since high school and now I can share it on my kindle with my children.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is one of the most annoying books I've read in a long time and I read a lot of books.  I could find no reason to recommend this book and finished it only because I had read a good review and hoped to find  a reason for that good review.  The improbable, nasty  liars  belong in a science-fiction movie.
0525423656|5.0|I totally can't wait until the 3rd book comes out!<br /><br />After reading 'Matched', you were probably like \\"What about Ky? Tell me more about this mysterious God!\\"<br /><br />Well, in 'Crossed', that's pretty much what the whole book is about. Ky, Ky, Ky. But, shall we complain? It's what most of us were wanting. If you were Team Xander, like many were, in 'Matched', you'll be sure to switch over to Team Ky by the middle of 'Crossed'. If not, you're insane..<br /><br />Basically, the whole book is about Cassia running to her lovely Ky and escaping the psychos (a.k.a Society) that are after them. But, Cassia knows what she wants and is willing to risk her own life to get it. You go girl!
B008MEM24S|4.0|I really enjoy the game, I just wish that the games I pay for differed from &quot;Where's My Water?&quot;. The obstacles are essentially identical.
1594744769|5.0|I just finished it. And, this may be my shortest review ever, but this is officially my favorite book of all time. Made me laugh. Made me cry. Made me cringe, because it all seemed so real. My heart is racing, and I'm still shaken by the whole last chapter. Definitely earned 10 stars, but can only get 5. I truly think that I'll never enjoy a book the same way I enjoyed this one.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Easy app to use :) It didn't take long to figure out how to navigate my way through the.Bible and the plans available for use.
0142419400|4.0|I must say, Stephanie Perkins has seriously outdone herself here. This book was absolutely amazing. I'm not one to read a teen romance without any magic involved. I picked up this book because of all the rave it was receiving from fellow YA bloggers. After getting into the first few chapters, I set the book aside saying \\"Why do people even write this crap?\\". But, that was when I thought this would be you're average 'girl-loves-boy', 'boy-likes-girl', 'boy-breaks-girls-heart' story. After really getting into it, I realized it was that plus so much more. I found I couldn't put the book down! I laughed at Anna's experiences, I cried at her heartache. Along with the romance, I actually felt like I was in Paris! Perkins packed in so many facts about the city along with some French language. After reading this, I felt like I could have an easy conversation in French. This book was excellently written and left me wanting more of Etienne St. Clair. Ohh-la-laa!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its not bad. the only downside is when your battery is low and its connected to the charger it stops whatever your doing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I'm not one to like apps, but this app is pretty awesome Especially if your on a kindell fire!!! I rate it 5 *'s.
B005D67O8W|5.0|Just what you come to expect from Dexter, well written and acted. Now you think poor Dex has someone to understand him...we know it can never be that easy.
1452101426|2.0|I was expecting much more in the way of finished art from the movie. The art that is included is from the development stages and is frequently blurry and impressionistic. The colors are much muddier than I was expecting as well.  I would encourage buyers to go to a physical bookstore and look through a copy before buying to ensure that it meets your expectations.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this a awesome game even though it is the same thing as where's my water<br />so yeah this is my review
B0000E1WKE|5.0|If you want an album that will bring you into the Christmas spirit, One Wish is the album for you.<br /><br />R.I.P. To the Best Christmas Voice Ever! :')<br /><br />Enjoy! : )
B004U8VUUC|5.0|This was a really good movie, so intriguing! I was so happy that I got it~!THis was a very good movie that left me guessing right up to the very end, I have always enjoyed thrilling movies and this was no exception!
B008602KQI|4.0|Very well done. Not as good as the trilogy however. I would have liked more information on each character & how they intertwine with each other. Really looking forward to the next film next year. Glad I read the books first!!!
0811879542|5.0|Our daughter just turned four and she loves this book. It is fairly simple as it is all about dots but the concept is amazing. As you do various things such as rubbing the dots or shaking the book the actions \\"change\\" the dots in ways. She really thinks she is having an effect on the book. It is so wonderful to see her engaged in this way.<br />I highly recommend this book!
159562015X|1.0|The book was new but someone had torn the \\"code\\" packet open in the back of the book and used it.  I bought the book online and did not know that in order to access the information that you had to have  a code that could only be used by one user. That is the main reason for the book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good read, the author is an American legend on par with Gunny Hathcock, possibly even better?<br />Then again, Hathcock didn't have half as much training/tech behind him to achieve what he achieved<br />in Vietnam that this author did. Kyle saved tons of American lives and may God bless him and his family.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Good season! Love Breaking Bad and this one is really good! Asa good as season one, but you will now want to just keep going on the roller coaster ride with these guys.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|This watch, the Seiko SKX009K2 automatic Diver's Jubilee watch, is an excellent watch, huge in size, face/bezel is the exact diameter of a silver dollar.<br />Just keep it moving and it stays wound-up automatically, but it retains spring power four about one day (if left un-moved) despite Seiko's claim that it<br />keeps spring power for up to three days. Beautiful watch to look at, stainless steel throughout, bezel is very tight but when in water it rotates very easily so<br />that must be a built-in design function. If you wear it most of the time, it keeps relatively accurate time but over the course of a week you will lose about<br />5 to 7 minutes of time and have to readjust the time manually to get it back on-time. IF you are adept and have the knowledge, you can adjust the escapement<br />to \\"accurize\\" the watch yourself, or take it to a watchsmith or jeweler and have them make minute adjustments to make it accurate. It's a mechanical watch<br />that needs no batteries, so what if it's a few minuttes off? Unless you're in EOD or a SEAL, exact time isn't critical.
0099450259|4.0|This may be one of the strangest books I have ever read. The entire time I was reading it, I couldn't decide whether I loved it or I hated it. I have never had a book evoke such a curious response from me.<br />  After a few strangely numbered chapters, I decided that anyone who can capture my attention and hold it with such a lack of anything actually transpiring, must be worth his salt. I think I ended up liking this book just because it was so very different than other things I have read.<br /><br />  The story moves along nicely and makes you think about things that your average novel may not. At times I felt like I was inside the head of this boy, which is a true accomplishment since the book really does not make use of vibrant description which is usually how I judge how real a reading experience was for me.<br /><br />  Over all I would Urge you to pick up this book and give it a try. You won't be sorry. It will give you something interesting to talk about in literary circles.
B005LAII58|5.0|I love Stallone's directing. Instead of waiting for others to direct, he goes on and does it all himself and makes a triple comeback with the last and proper ending for Rocky, then Rambo, and then tops it all off with his own creation - The Expendables! Again, co-writing and directing it all himself.<br /><br />So of course Expendables 2 comes out and lets loose the dogs of war - but even bigger and somewhat better.<br /><br />Never a dull moment, Ex 2 starts out with one of the best and most explosive action scenes EVER recorded. The movie hardly ever comes up for air, and before ya know it, its over and you find yourself properly pumped up as an avid moviegoer. Don't take it too seriously. It is a plain old-fashioned action flick staring the biggest and the baddest action stars in the last 3 decades. (Actually a wee bit more because of Stallone himself!)<br /><br />Stallone and Statham make a great bromance couple. Statham makes tons of the same movie, except most don't use his solid acting skills, but only use his action moves. Always the wooden action dude.<br /><br />But Stallone is much smarter than your typical writer/director. He's been around long enough to know the movie audience needs and wants more. So he creates an actual storyline around Statham's character, showcasing his solid acting skills like no other director has done since SNATCH.<br /><br />Yes, there are new and longer parts for the other actions stars, from Chuck Norris to Van Damme, but Stallone has and does outdo them all here, both as an actor and a storyteller/director.<br /><br />I love both films. A must see for any action fan who loves a solid popcorn summer movie.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|First off, of course its not 100% true to the book. No movie is, if you think it should be...then your expectations may be set a little too high. Other than that, it had a nice pace, great acting and decent enough camera work. One flaw I seen was character development, not enough is known about the kids from the other districts. It was glossed over very quickly with some \\"this is their name and the district they are from\\" and really needed a bit more background info on the main ones. All in all its a good movie...but will not be to everyones taste. Rent it before you buy it.

B004LWZWGA|3.0|Half a loaf rising.<br /><br />The first two installments of the Dark Knight series - \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" - provided plenty of cerebral fodder to chew on when not regaling us with vertiginous fist fights, wild villains and novel weapons. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" has ditched the brain food for an occasionally dreary pate of mass boxing, an obnoxiously booming soundtrack and smaller-than life heroes. Not that this is a bad movie. It is plenty entertaining. But it fails to complete the brains-and-brawn arc drawn by the first two installments.<br /><br />Telling the entire story would spoil the plot twists in this film. Suffice it to say that after his long-ago encounter with the Joker, Bruce Wayne has hung up his cape and cowl and retreated into self-pity and isolation. The Wayne empire, source of his wealth and philanthropy, has been ignored and is on the verge of collapse. Wayne needs a major kick in the cape to propel him out of the doldrums and back into the fray. The kick comes in the form of a nasty bad guy - Bain - a brawny psychopath who wears a Darth-Vader-ish mouthpiece. Bain and his henchmen have focused their attention on Gotham City, and plan the beginning of some global-sized hijinks.<br /><br />What the film lacks in depth, it gains in length. At two and three-quarters hours long, no viewer can say they didn't get their money's worth. The film's pace, just a hair above languid, gives the director plenty of time to spin out his series-ending plot. It's hardly a spoiler to tell that the League of Shadows, the bud guys from Batman Begins, have not taken their sights off Gotham City. Like avenging angels with a fixation on sin, the League still wants to destroy Gotham for its crimes. The convoluted plot involves boardroom attempts to save the Wayne empire, stories from a mysterious Middle Eastern prison, a distraught Alfred, a talented cat burglar and Bruce Wayne's battered and aging frame.<br /><br />My criticism is that the film only hinted at themes that could have made it a killer film. The bad guys are given a ridiculously long time to harry Gotham, giving their enemies plenty of time to regroup. Good thing, because Bruce Wayne is aging, depressed and out of shape. A doctor confirms that his knees have no remaining cartilage. But a few pushups, pull-ups (and in one case, a punch in the spine) later, and all is well, infirmities forgotten. An inexplicable conflict with Alfred manages only to be mawkish and embarrassing. The fight scenes, especially one in which Batman and a few thousand cops engage in a ridiculous and dull street brawl with the bad guys, make Batman look small. And, people, we must never, never see Batman *walk* anywhere! The bat drops in unexpectedly or is silhouetted against the moon - not taking an evening stroll in that goofy getup.<br /><br />Sure, there are plenty of explosions, peril, close calls and coolish gadgets in the film. But how cool are they when an extraneous character jumps on the Bat bike for the first time and rides it as well as  Batman? How neat is the Batmobile when a police chopper shadows it without difficulty? How bad is a boss when a mere fistfight can take him out. How deep can a movie be when it cheats the audience of a challenging ending? A weird, disappointing movie, full of plot holes where its brains should have been.d at themes that could have made it a killer film.

B000QXDED6|3.0|This adaptation of Frank Miller's ultra-macho graphic novel of the same name, is a huge success. At least insofar as it brings the blood-soaked Battle of Thermopylae to the attention of the viewing public. And, not incidentally, by bringing Miller's already-lively art to cinematic life.<br /><br />Everything about the movie is larger than life. The muscled and hardened Spartans, with their dewy pecs and scarlet battle cloaks. The effete, face-pierced Persian king Xerxes, the god-man who  would conqueror Greece. The grossly-deformed, Gollum-like, Ephialtes who will betray the Spartans. The Spartans themselves, who laugh madly at danger and welcome glorious death. The film's strangeness is also outsized. Noble King Leonidas is the wise Spartan strongman. But his rule seems tempered by a typically sniveling and timid city council. In battle, Leonidas's men waste time and energy building enormous barricades from the corpses of their foes. The battles themselves are drawn out affairs that feature if-looks-could-kill snarling, martial-arts slashing and spinning, many severed heads and gallons of splashing blood. In an objective case of the aphorism \\"less is more,\\" the film oversaturates us with fighting, noble manliness, dehumanized enemies and treacherous friends. It often comes \\"this close\\" to becoming a self-parody. Indeed, there were more than a few times when the portrayal of \\"nobility\\" spilled over into mawkishness. Leonid's goodbye scene with his wife, in which she tells him to \\"Come back with your shield or on it,\\" being one of the most blatant.<br /><br />That said, many of the film's artistic touches were wonderful. Several scenes of Spartans in battle were deliberately reminiscent of familiar images of lance-hurling warriors on Greek pottery. The weird brownish lighting gave the film an ancient, other-worldly glow.<br /><br />As a parallel to current events, \\"300\\" is curious. Do we in the US see ourselves as a few noble fighters, enfeebled by legislation, prone to betrayal by our own, and faced with hordes of demonic foes? Perhaps we do, and perhaps that's why US soldiers watch this film to pump themselves up for battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. If so, then \\"300\\" is a cultural marker that says more about our internal sense of vulnerability and isolation than it does about any objective assessment of our strength. It's from these ironies that many an academic thesis is built!to betrayal by our own, and faced with hordes of demonic foes?

0385334206|2.0|I loved The Sirens of Titan when I'd read it. The central idea behind the book - that the search for meaning might end somewhere disappointing - was fascinating and fun to explore. I've loved books in a similar vein. James Morrow was one of my favorite authors, and I'd love to re-read \\"City of Truth\\" some time. I've also grown accustomed - and even learned to enjoy - since I first saw Night of the Living Dead as an adolescent going on teenager, to authors hiding behind their work to sometimes throw stones or sometimes just raspberry the world around them. Probably my favorite part of every Twilight Zone episode is the small, universal, fun messages behind the show that you just can't help but agree with in spite of everything. And what episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents would be complete without Alfred's own dry wit? As you can tell, my taste in entertainment predates me by quite a few years. What I'm trying to say, is that by all rights I should have liked this book.<br /><br />So I went into this, expecting an entertaining premise I could follow. Ideas I could chew on. Plot I could try to understand. Characters I could care about. \\"And so on\\". And maybe with a healthy shaking of Vonnegut's own wit, wisdom, and voice, like salt and pepper on a baked potato. To stretch the analogy a little further, I was even prepared for a bit of raunchy sour cream.<br /><br />What I got was salt, pepper, sour cream, butter, and no potato.<br /><br />The book was written in 1973, I told myself. These ideas weren't quite so hackneyed and done. Sure it felt like reading a Garfield strip, but back then even Jim Davis' unique brand of humor would have been futuristic and edgy. The world must have been a simpler, more innocent place back then. It just had to be.<br /><br />I told myself similar things every time I was told which political philosophies to subscribe to, pressing issues to care about, \\"and so on\\". I reminded myself that maybe these concepts were flying in the face of anunchallenged status quo back then. I'm even now refusing to create a model to check these assumptions against reality. I'm refusing to look up on Wikipedia how long Nixon had been President already in 1973. I don't want to know whether this was before or after George Carlin was arrested. I've got a comfortable fiction protecting me from hating Mr Vonnegut, the man that's given us so much better than this, and I'm happy there.<br /><br />But I've made it four chapters. Maybe it'll be fun reading what other people reviewing the book have to say about Mr Hoover's antics and how people close to him like this Bunny character I've heard about react. I'm throwing a book away, intentionally. Not just putting it on my bookcase lying to myself about reading it some day. I can't get a refund, but honestly, I don't want one; there is a good chance that, should I return the audio book to the store I bought it from, it would end up on the shelf where someone else might buy it, and I don't want that on my conscience.<br /><br />What I'm saying, is that I'm genuinely happy for you if you enjoyed the book. But I obviously didn't, and seeing as how Mr Vonnegut made it a point to let us know he has no intention of pulling punches, I don't think it would be right for me to do so either.
080017948X|5.0|Who expects depth from Bill Murray? Not me! But \\"Groundhog Day\\" was a great Bill Murray film - with a moral even!<br /><br />Murray plays a weatherman Phil Connors on a local Pennsylvania TV station who is assigned to do an on-the-scene standup. To his dismay, it is at unveiling of Punxatony Phil - the groundhog who predicts whether spring is imminent or 6 weeks away. Phil is a narcissistic twit, who feels the assignment is beneath him. But his snarkiness is put on hold when he gets the hots for on-location producer Rita (Andy McDowell). Andy is a very nice lady who sees right through Murray. No chance the two of them will end up together.<br /><br />A blizzard forces an overnight stay. But when Phil wakes up, he discovers that it is still February 2! It takes Phil several cycles to really believe that he is reliving precisely the same day. AT which time he does what every egomaniac would do: he tries to takes advantage of this situation. He scores with attractive women (after learning their likes and dislikes in previous lives), and otherwise tries to enrich himself. But Rita, his real quarry, is nowhere near his net.<br /><br />Telling more would ruin the film. Suffice it to say that Phil gets tired of his repetitive victories, and undergoes a Scroogelike metamorphosis. Kudos to writer/producer Harold Ramis for sneaking this cute morality take onto our radar. And for making it real. Which of us, when realizing, in a dream, that we are dreaming, does not try to use that knowledge for self-gratification of self-improvement? Ramis has taken that common experience and run it to it logical conclusion. A terrific film with brains, heart and soul.

You will not regret it. From start to finish, this cd is amazing.<br />My favorite songs are Adrenalize, Comanche, Burn, From the Ashes, and Beast Within.<br />Go see them in concert...and if this is your first in this moment cd...prepare to have a new favorite band!!!
145162607X|5.0|Anne Neville was a lesser known noblewoman and queen of England. In The Kingmaker's Daughter, Philippa Gregory brings Anne to vibrant life by writing about her difficult life and subsequent rise to glory as Queen of England. What is most heart-wrenching about Anne's story is that she and her sister, Isabel, were pawns to the men in their lives whose quest for power was relentless.<br /><br />Although Anne is not the spirited, feisty heroine of other historical biographical novels, she is truly fascinating. It is important that these women's lives are written about, not only to show the extent of their suffering at the hands of the men surrounding them, but to clearly reflect the true status of women and their lack of rights in all eras of history. What is important is that Philippa Gregory has written a true and accurate accounting of this woman's life, and that is what I applaud highly. Her conflict with Elizabeth Woodville is deep and all encompassing throughout the novel and makes for a fascinating story-line.<br /><br />Although Anne is not the fiery heroine, the conflict surrounding her is all consuming and makes for fast page-turning. The novel captures the reader's interest from the very first to the very last page. It is eloquently written with believable characters, an incredible amount of brilliant descriptions, and wonderful emotion.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter is the fourth book in a series about the women in Cousin's War Series - Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort, and Jacquetta Woodville. It is not necessary to read this in any particular order. It is fascinating to see how the author moves between these characters, fairly depicting them and their personalities, despite their faults. Fans of Philippa Gregory will definitely enjoy this novel set in a disorderly and dangerous period in England's rich history. I highly recommend this! What a wonderful story!
