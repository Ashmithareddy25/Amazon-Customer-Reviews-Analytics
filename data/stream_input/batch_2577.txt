B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I had purchased this 46mm Invicta watch just days after recieving the black face model.<br />These guys do a great job and build quality watches, with really well made components.<br />Large face, thick body, with a bold, masculine look. Really stands out.<br />You won't be disappointed. Stand out in the crowd...go bold.<br />Great item.<br />Thanks.<br />Steve

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not sure what I can add here that hasn't already been said.  I am not a sci-fi person by any means and this is one of the best books I have ever read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun to play. It's a nice game to have if u love horses but your parents won't let u have one.
B0000ACY0Y|4.0|I first learned about this album after reading a Rolling Stone article devoted to &#34;the Section,&#34; L.A.'s famed rhythm section who played with everyone from Jackson Browne to James Taylor to Carole King.  I knew Gene Clarke from his stint with the Byrds, but had never heard any of his solo stuff.<br /><br />Upon picking this up, I was marginally pleased.  I could see how it could be classified as a forgotten classic.  Nice songs.  Profound and original lyrics.  Emotional singing.  Some highlights include the title song, &#34;From a Silver Phial,&#34; and &#34;The True One.&#34;  For my first few listens, I ignored the bonus tracks.  Then, on a whim, I decided to give them a listen.  Suffice it to say, I'm glad I did.  It's these tunes, for me, that are truly the best on the album.  Not only do you get to hear &#34;Train Leaves Here This Morning,&#34; a fine tune which Clarke wrote with former Eagle Bernie Leadon - it appeared on that band's debut album - but six of the original album's eight cuts, stripped down without some of the over-production that at times marred the original versions.  These bonus cut versions seem looser and more authentic and less bogged down with slickness.
B001NA6096|4.0|It is slow in parts, but I love the tiny nuances. And it appeals to the hopeless romantic in me.
B004B7N9NI|5.0|This is a perfect movie for the 3D format. It is so colorful and it is very informative as well.
B002WJI66C|2.0|My main problem with my Ghost Boo is that the mouth is lot smaller then in pictures. He look like he was punch in the face and have swollen mouth.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter downlaoded this game and now my son, hubby and myself playing the game. Great game for all ages and its FREE.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought this because I lost my other copy of Spirited Away. The movie is inspiring, and truly magical. I was surprised when I found the movie in brand-new condition as my other copy was used because I couldn't find a new copy of this movie ANYWHERE! :P
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway augers is a great app when your bord or alone. It has misson and prides and gifts. And when your not raedy to die on the game you press save me and it saves you.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|I seen this on tv and wanted too buy this because he knew that something was wrong with him. and he went too get help<br />but he should of told his wife so that she can help him.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this product and wasn't clear about what it does. I can say that the case provides a sturdy place to store my blue tooth and it charges while in the case. It's small enough to fit in my bag and charges quickly. Highly recommend it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It hasn't even been 24 hours since I've started this phenomenal read. John Green constructed an amazing piece of art that ill carry with me forever. I feel like Hazel right now, wondering what happens of the characters. Thank you John Green. Thank you.

B00BB3UYS8|5.0|found this book through a friend on FB  yesterday, started reading and could not put it down, I have always believed in the things that have been described in the book (not giving anything away) and it was exciting to read about. thank you Brandt Legg for the incredible journey this book worm will be sure to pass it along for others to enjoy. Looking forward to reading the next book soon.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is really pretty and fun as well.  Have one game on my kindle and another on my phone.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hilarious! I'm terrible at driving games but this game is too funny to get mad at. Easy to catch onto, easy to get upgrades and easy to unlock different vehicles and locations. No tutorial necessary, very easy controls. I'm having a lot of fun with this one!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I don't want to reveal too much of anything, but Harris has wrapped the story lines up nicely.  Several of Sookie's recurrent threats are gone, which is a huge relief to her.  Sookie's romantic life gets straightened out in a way that I found logical, given the personalities involved.<br /><br />Please remember that the HBO series bears little resemblance to the books, and don't expect plot lines to match.
0545265355|4.0|I enjoyed the film but the books are so much better.<br /><br />Book 1 is really good.<br /><br />Book 2, not quite so good but I still could not put it down.<br /><br />Book 3 gives the impression it was a little rushed, but it is still well worth it.<br /><br />.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|By far one of the best &quot;room&quot; escape games I've ever played. The puzzles are challenging without being impossible though there are hints if needed. The graphics are also some of t he best I've ever seen.
B002436WFI|1.0|I was incredibly disappointed. This has the guy from LOTR and contains a plot that would seem incredibly creative and entertaining for young kids and young teens. What it actually contains is adult only humor. Note that it is &#34;not rated&#34; for this reason. For example, it has a very old barbarian save a damsel in distress only to make repeated references to using a stick to have sex with her. There is more extensively dispersed perverted sexual humor. Buyer Beware
1781162646|5.0|I listened to the Audible.com version of the book and it was a great experience. The story is not as intense as most King books but very well-written. The amusement park is a interesting setting - I felt I was back in the days before mega-parks. Quick read you will enjoy!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Love the cinematography and the action!  Looking forward to the next part coming out in December 2013!  Excellent family movie.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I don't know how else to report this problem. My energy is not refilling. I left it sit for at least 8 hours while I slept and came back to only 43 energy. I have over 100 energy to fill. Let's do a little math... energy fills one every three minutes, there are 60 minutes in an hour... in eight hours that's 480 minutes.. divided by 3 (the number of minutes it takes for one minute) is 160..... my energy should be full!! Where the he'll is me ENERGY?!?!!!!!!!
B008MM9630|5.0|I enjoy playing this game,because I get to build a fairy town. If you enjoy building stuff, you will enjoy this game.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|I thought the subtraction of Megan Fox might breathe new life into this.  Nope.  The new girl is good but I think it's just Shia is not a believeable (or even that likeable) hero, and what was with the woman who was the intelligence director?
B0077ATSSQ|3.0|It is about 911.  It was extremely emotional for me to watch.  The actors were great, but it is so painful to know what happened and why and by whom.  This is a horrible thing we must live with when we are confronted by terrorists that want to rule the world.
B00CKWQN9S|4.0|Other than a couple of tracks... I have been mesmerized by most of the songs on this cd.<br />The lyrics are as spellbinding as the music...I have never purchased a movie soundtrack so off the charts amazing!
B007XIC1GI|3.0|Knew nothing of Marilyn Manson.  That's why I thought I'd try it.  Toward the end, it gets just gross.  The beginning is a good story but then he just gets so twisted it was making my stomach churn.  Not great.
B00C7JFIRC|1.0|Excellent movie, terribly greedy. Should come in a 3d/2d/digital combo pack. Let me know when you get that and I'll certainly buy that.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I've watched this several times.  I'm nutz crazy about horses even tho they aren't nutz crazy about me. But this is an excellent move and great entertainment for the entire family. I like war movies, and you must, too, to like this.  Good Job, Well done!
159463176X|4.0|Once again, Mr. Hosseini proves himself to be a master story teller.  You care about the characters and what happens to them; the outcome is not predictable; and, while you can't put it down once you start reading, you also hate to see it end.  Very good book which is already being passed around among friends.
0399162097|5.0|I was very lucky to receive \\"We are all completely beside ourselves\\" as an ARC from another source. When I started this novel, I underestimated it. Had to fight through a few chapters and I am so glad I did. I was drawn to it because of the subject matter. The quote from the New York Times says 'the story of an American family, middle-class in middle America, ordinary in every way but one. But that exception is the beating heart of this extraordinary novel. You must read it..And love it.
B00C1BV9Z6|1.0|I have a 20 mb connection. I never got this to stream in even a decent picture. Not anywhere close to hd. I ran a speed test half way through and my connection was still 17mb. Amazon servers were sad tonight...and I paid extra for hd for us :(
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This a a great movie about Alvin York, a  consiencious objector in WWI. But, he overcame, realized he had a job to do, and became  a hero. All young children should see this movie.  This guy REALLY existed!

B004IPPINW|5.0|The narrative in this book grabs you and pulls you in. I found the writing refreshing and suggest it highly to those enjoy good story telling.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie ! Surprised at how good it was. Why compare it to the book. 99% of the time, the book is always better than the movie. Why even compare the two? I thought this was a very good film that didn't totally rely on action scenes to carry it through. It kept you guessing, and held a high level of suspense. What else can you ask for. This movie was far better than most films released the past two years. IMHO.
B000000OU6|5.0|This first solo album by Slash totally blows away any thing he did with Guns N Roses. Its nice hearing him work with a great vocalist. Ive always thought Axl sucked. But liked Gun's music. Why did I wait so long to buy this wonderful kick ass album?
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's very fun and I like how you can indirectly spread your disease by upgrading it and how it tells you how lethal,sensitive, and infectivity.
B00BU2SIW4|3.0|If you are a Depeche Mode fan and must have everything they produce, I'm not talking to you.<br /><br />If you are looking for something fresh to add to your collection, this album isn't it. The promotional material for this album hyped it up quite a bit. I was looking forward to a bluesy DM album, however, there's really only the one song, “Slow” that truly sounds like the Blues. “Goodbye” has a line of blues guitar in it but is a pop structure and overall sound.<br /><br />Stand out tracks are “Heaven,” “Goodbye” and “Slow”. The rest sounds familiar but has been done better on earlier albums, ULTRA, Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I prefer the original and RIO. This one has several levels that are more annoying than entertaining. Buy the others.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|Though there are good scenes, especially early in the book, the tedium of predictably good, not to say angelic, slaves and monstrous owners brings the book down. Add to this a weak heroine who has little common sense and there's not much to make one want to read on.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app helps me wake up for school and i am only 10 really and it helps me everyone should get this app! :)
B00340LM8C|5.0|The way the shots are framed, Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, the young French lady and the fantastic location are all beautiful and a delight to watch. The HD quality seems to be pretty good, an amazing step forward from the DVD experience.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Not only was the box incredibly tiny for the price, but it had been previously opened and pieces were missing.  Disgraceful!
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|It is difficult to look up single words or I just don't know how to use it. Maybe its me!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|An amazing, spellbinding book begging further research. I know nothing about the author or the validity of the picture he paints.  If nK is anything like it is portrayed in the book, we should be worried.<br />  The book is easy to read and quickly captures the attention, making it difficult to put down. In sum, it is very easy to understand why this earned a Pulitzer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is kind of fun it's easy to play uhh I'm just trying to fill up space so yeah I'd recommend buying it
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Previously used the brand before this purchase and decided to upgrade.  Absolutely a great decision and this upgrade purchase was actually better than the price paid here locally for the lesser model.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft deserves 5 stars because it is the most creative way to express yourself. This game shows the way for future architects.

B0091WNK8M|5.0|This film is a definite favorite of mine. The entire cast is great. The story meets everyone's fantasy of finding treasure. Children and adults will enjoy this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing love it cant stop playing it it is so much fun but I do wish they would give u more gems and money
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|I am only 8 days into the SC diet, I have lost 2 belt loops off my waist, I can see veins again in my arms and people are stopping me to ask what im doing. I have higher energy levels than i can remember since school days and it has completely quelled my urge to smoke (previously 1-2 packs per day). Thanks Tim!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Not completely finished with this book, but I enjoyed going back and forth between her trip on the PCT and her past personal life.  Extremely well written.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was desparate for a tool I could use to put my many. notes, ideas,  thoughts for oh so many projects I always have going on. A saavy media specialist observed my plight and suggested evernote. Eager for s solution to help me cope I immediately downloaded the app and didn't look at it for a couple of months.<br /><br />After a few short weeks of use I cant imagine being without. Easy to get up and going...then as time permits I have discovered even more ways to incorporate EVERYTHING. I immediately decided on upgrading to premium for the unbelievable low price.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing show and cast. Emmys well deserved. Can't wait for season 4. Well written, smart and captivating. It's a must watch.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Its kills time while riding in a long car ride  because you have to figured out things. Its pretty fun.
B003NS2T9G|3.0|I started watching Torchwood because I'm a Doctor Who fan.  Torchwood leans a bit too much towards a typical crime drama for my taste.  I'll probably watch the series, but I certainly won't tear through it like I've done for other series.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|This was not my favorite this year but some others in our book club really liked it,<br />The love story left me flat but that is just me.
B00BI745AA|3.0|Acting is superb, but the vocals are very disappointing.  Russell Crowe should never sing in public again!  Overall, glad I did not pay to see this at the theatre.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|What was the &#34;best kept secret&#34; after all? Odd and abrupt ending... Is this book really written by Jeffrey Archer?
0307352153|1.0|There have been a number of books (including this one) which offer advice and operate on the premise that assert the following:<br /><br />a) there are two very broad and fundamentally distinct types of personality -- the extrovert and the introvert;<br />b) these two types have a distinct set of characteristics and/or capabilities;<br />c) that, depending on which one YOU are, you will be STUCK with these type-related psychological characteristics and/or capabilities (and this because of genetic or hereditary reasons)<br /><br />This conceptualization is needlessly self-limiting. Readers would be FAR BETTER OFF reading EITHER Carol Dweck's book on Self-Theories or the popular counterpart to that academic work -- MINDSETS -- or Albert Bandura's SELF-EFFICACY: THE EXERCISE OF CONTROL. Either (or both) of these books will entirely transform the way you think about yourself and your abilities to succeed in any domain of human activity.  And neither book makes ANY REFERENCE to the introvert-extrovert dichotomy.<br /><br />This psychological construct does no real operational work; it has zero functional value in assisting you in realizing your performance goals.  It just gets you thinking, \\"Am I an introvert or an extrovert? If so, then, whatever advantages come with being one, I also am subject to certain FIXED disadvantages.\\"  This is just needless psychological taxonomization or categorization.  And for what functional purpose?  I'm an introvert, so _____? I am NOT entitled to think of myself as someone who can develop high competency in social situations socially?<br /><br />The problem with these books is that, when you read them, you INTERNALIZE this construct -- i.e., INTROVERSION -- you begin to psychologically own the limitations that characterize the type.  This is needlessly self-limiting.  People are multi-dimensional beings:  a person who is shy in one context may be outspoken in the context of her friends or family.  Did she suddendly SHED her introverted SELF from one social context to the next?  The problem with books like these is their simplistic explanatory constructs which can't cope with the data of human behavior.  And the data suggests that, while people do exhibit certain behavioral tendencies -- which are NOT inviolable physical laws -- these aren't attributable to a fixed internal trait.  To think so is agency-denying -- but to self-beliefs they have about their capacities to cope in diverse environments. These beliefs -- what Bandura calls \\"self-efficacy beliefs\\" -- are things about you which you can take positive steps to change.<br /><br />There's no denying that there are proclivitiers are tendencies in one's behavior, but these tendencies don't have to be explained by reference to some FIXED TRAIT -- INTROVERTEDNESS -- which is immune to self-change and development.  But that is exactly what books of this type lead you to do, to internalize the TYPE and then accept its profile of (celebrated) \\"Advantages\\" as well as its disadvantages.  Here's the take-home:  there's a different way to carve up this psychological space.  Consider that it is much more likely to be the case that, in some areas you excel not because of some deep-lying mechanism -- introvertedness -- but because your current skill set has a HISTORY:  And to date you have developed capacities in some domains, while in others you have not.  So when you INTROSPECT about what you're capable of, or whether you feel confident about speaking at such-and-such conference, if you have little experiential mastery in the domain of public speaking, then OF COURSE you are going to feel a low degree of self-confidence (perceived self-efficacy) in this domain.  Where your capacities are less well developed, your confidence is correspondingly lower.<br /><br />In Bandura's book SELF-EFFICACY, you'll find a agent-friendly and self-empowering account of the concept of \\"perceived self-efficacy.\\"  A self-efficacy belief is a belief you have about your own capacities to produce successful performances in a SPECIFIC DOMAIN.  But these self-beliefs aren't WRITTEN IN STONE.  You can alter your perceived self-efficacy in \\"extroverted\\" domains (say, public speaking) by taking the necessary courses, getting the necessary practice and skills in this domain.  What happens?  You develop increased self-efficacy belief and discover that you weren't an \\"introvert\\" afterall.<br /><br />AS ALBERT BANDURA HIMSELF SAYS: ***MAY THE EFFICACY FORCE BE WITH YOU.***acities to produce successful performances in a SPECIFIC DOMAIN.

B0060AY6FO|4.0|This was a good story for a writer following Jane Austin's style. I would read another by this author if<br />it were to be followed up.  The club also enjoyed the story as we didn't expect this.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Just when you think they can't do anything more crazy or weird, they go and surprise you.  They manage to make you laugh and keep you hooked all at the same time.  This is my second time watching this show, and it still manages to stay interesting and make me want to watch more.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Everything about this movie is amazing. The story, the acting, the directing, the cinematography. A great flick, you feel transported to that era.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Exceptional reading.  Really pulls on your heart strings.  Almost visual while reading.<br />Really enjoyed this book and the writer's style.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It's a okay book.  Way to long to keep in interest very long.<br />If there is nothing else to do than you may want to read it.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Very entertaining.. Like the storyline. I would recommend this series to my friends. I'm currently watching the next one too..
B00973902K|5.0|This song can be truly considered one of the iconic anthems of our generation. Call Me Maybe exploded onto everyone's radios and iPods and has not been shelved sense. The quality of this song makes it well worth purchasing and I highly recommend every and anyone download this great song.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I love this movie. It was definitely made with adults in mind. Love the witty, dry, humor. It's full of sarcasm. I couldn't love it anymore if I wanted to. My younger kids (3 and 7) don't understand this movie as much, but my 9 year old thinks it's hysterical. Even though the younger kids don't understand all of the jokes, they like it. They still get some of the more obvious jokes.
B00821OX98|4.0|Although i would like more realistic aliens, the plot is good and the characters and acting is good. Worth watching.
0385474547|3.0|Having never read an African writer that I can remember I ordered this book.  It described very primitive African people in a very authentic voice.  I was a bit disappointed to learn the writer was quite civilized.  As a folk tale or a study of a primitive man it was will written and full of interesting detail, but all in all, not my thing.
0143034901|4.0|Read this book for a Book Club.  Was well written and enjoyable.  I will read more of Carlos Ruiz Zafon
B00992CF6W|1.0|it is so hard to move and you do not have nearly as much things as you do on the computer. I think that this was just like throwing seven dollars out the window that i would've spent on spongebob episodes. Minecraft has been a hot trend and i will say, i am over it. In fact, it is sitting in the back of my cloud in my kindle right now. Never to be played again. Never; and i mean never!, pay any more money to this company than i already have.
B0012CH350|5.0|The product arrived promptly in good condition.  It fits the grill perfectly as you would expect.  So much better than buying  a generic one size fits all.  It is a heavy gauge of material so I think it will last.  Elastic vents allow for easy slip on and off while holding it tight on a windy day.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Ordered a set of Modern Family as Christmas gifts for relatives.  Truly a funny, witty entertaining show.  Truly a MUST SEE!
B000B8QG0O|5.0|I strongly recommend this movie as with any of the Toy Story movies in the series. My toddler can't get enough of Woody and Buzz. Parents can enjoy this movie as well. Hope they continue making more of these movies.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|F****** Epic just like COD Black ops 2 They cannot make this any better than it already is.<br />I give this the best rating ever. And an awesome gameplay
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This was a welcome home gift for my better half.  She loved it and trust me she watches Columbo every day and wanted the complete series.  Thank you for the prompt delivery and excellent shipping conditions.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|It was rather refreshing to have a leading female character who is more clever and intelligent than the lead male character. It was also nice to see a male lead that wasn't just well to do and handsome, but also had morals and didn't have a large amount of sexual expertise. I am now going to read the other novels written by this author.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I learned things I've been wondering for a long time.<br />I have been to many Eagles concerts, have many of their cd's, but this DVD has footage I've never seen before.<br />It was very honest. Even comments from Don Felder that explained questions I've had.<br />They are a Class Act. Always Good!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Somebody once told me, you could tell within the first 5 minutes if this movie was for you or not. I don't quite know where that cut off was in the film, but judging from the opening scenes I would assume he was correct. Hansel and Gretel are forced into the woods, seemingly abandoned by their parents. They find the candy cottage and the rest of the story plays out like you remember. The witch captures them, and then they kill her. The actual movie and story are what happens after that, and mostly because of it. Seeing the little kids kill the witch elicits a very interesting reaction. You will either be turned off by the blood, and overall cheesiness of the scene. Or you will smile and turn your brain off for the next 90 minutes. I chose to do the later, and so should you.<br /><br />This movie reminded me a lot of Van Helsing, and was about as poorly received. This movie suffers from a lot of the same issues as Van Helsing however. It is corny, poorly written, tends to go to far with CGI. But it also shares a lot of the same strengths. Good action, neat weapons and concepts, and lovely atmosphere. It also pulls off the Horror comedy role pretty decently. From Hansel having Diabetes from being force fed candy while younger, to the stalker superfan that just wants to be part of the team. The movie gets quite a few laughs, and kept me entertained for its duration.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of blood, feel free to pass this one up. It is by no means a gory film, but it does have more then most films these days. Seeing witches cut into many different pieces flying at the screen for example. I bet that scene made good use of the 3D offered in theaters.<br /><br />If you still are not convinced if this is a movie for you, Let me leave you with the best line from it. \\"I hate to break this to you, but this isn't gonna be an open casket.\\" If that line doesn't do it for you, nothing else in this movie will.<br /><br />3 out of 5<br /><br />A note on my rating not liningup. I do reviews on my facebook for fun, the 3/5 score is how good of a movie I think it is. The 4/5 amazon stars is how much I enjoyed it.

B00881VLCE|1.0|I tried but it would not work correctly on my Kindle Fire. It would only show me a few pieces and then kept playing them in a loop. I left the game &amp;tried going back in several times but the game never loaded again.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was a book I couldn't put down. And when I had too, Jack was in my head talking to me until I returned. A must read for everyone!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its free so what else needs to be said.  Play it on a Kindle.  Its free so what else needs to be said.
0140149295|5.0|A true story happened in my State of New Jersey.  The dedication of 1 young man reading this book helped free him from prison.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Incredibly honest and heartfelt, this story will make you sob, and leave you empty and full all at the same time. A fast and beautiful read, I highly recommend it.
B0099G3I96|4.0|Sorry to say I haven't listened to much, digital download which I can't play in my 2005 350Z and can't bring digital into my work location.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm sorry but I just love these characters ! So what if there's another installment . Think of what the poor Harry Potter fans went through! I am personally sad when I come to an ending of a book . I feel like I'm saying goodbye to a friend .I'll be more than happy to buy the next one !  af
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I found a lot of free reads.  Easy access and lots of selections.  Very nicely categorised and with adequate descriptions.
B0095P31L6|5.0|My 10 and 12 yr old and I watched it again, it's been awhile, but still loved it, great movie.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Very convenient to be able to watch my 'missed' shows.  Amazon made it easy to be able to watch the show that I had missed.
B009NY43NY|2.0|First time reading a &#34; Sookie Stackhouse&#34;. Not my style of read. Purchased by mistake in first place and consider it a little mistake I hope I don't make again
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I usually find myself involved with three to four books at a time.  But I started reading this and could not put in down.  Inspirational.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Watched this the first time and was struck by the multiple plot lines and excellent acting.  We are looking forward to more...
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Steve Carell, always hilarious!  And he doesn't disappoint in this movie!  Who knew Ryan Gosling was so funny?  Of course, he's hot, as always.  His acting is always superb!  I never saw that ending coming!  They really had me going.  Just a whole cast of great actors and actresses.
B002B0NAV8|4.0|I'm not usually attracted to this kind of music but there is something about Deftones that I like. I can't listen to this constantly but it fits in to my CD changer in just the right spot and when it pops in during random play it's &#34;on time&#34;.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Cocaine!!! It is one hell of a drug man!!!  Poor alcohlics and druggies.  Please tell me the airlines screen their pilots better than they did in this movie.  Denzel did an outstanding job!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I purchased this dvd for my boyfriend as he is a huge Walking Dead fan. He was very pleased that I got this for him, and right away watched it for the special features. The package arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B009LIQ5FQ|5.0|If ever there was any doubt that the Pogues are one of the all-time great live bands (not to mention all time great bands, full stop) then this is the final proof. If you've ever been to a Pogues concert then this does an amazing job of recreating the experience - bettering it in some ways, since Shane has rarely, if ever been so... coherent. The first time I ever saw them he could sing ok, but otherwise stood vacantly on the stage, whirling his mic around in a daze. Here he is on top of his game and clearly having fun. But no one goes to a Pogues concert for the vocal abilities (throughout the show we also get Spider, Terry and Andrew all crooning, and none of them are going to win any awards); the Pogues have always been about the energy, skill and sheer exuberant joy of the instruments, and it is so good to see that, 30 years on, they can all still produce in abundance. Even Phil Chevron, who is obviously suffering from his cancer, is channeling everything he has into the performance.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is verging on perfection. My only regret is the absence of White City, one of their best songs and a true live classic, and I wish I could switch that out for Bottle of Smoke. But that's nitpicking. It's almost impossible to watch this and not find yourself jumping around with a huge smile on your face, reveling in one of the truly great songwriters of the 20th century.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Great movie. Lincoln has always been my hero since my youth. The film portrayed him in the true beauty of his life and the great contribution he made to this country. It this time were our freedoms are once again being challenged (this time by the Government itself) we would do well do learn from his example.
1476712042|5.0|Ok, this book is amazing. And guess what to all the adults out there. This book is for teenagers so all the adults saying its boring. You know if you looked at the genre it wasn't for you. So shut the freak up and stop reading thanks
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Keep them coming,,,getting to love this series, and looking forward to seeing the Movie, all character's are very engrossing , can't wait to see what they develop into.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The only disappointment was that it was not named Best Picture. It was a wonderful film, a true masterpiece of movie making.
0345803507|3.0|I actually liked the first one in this trilogy, and the second one I thought was just okay. But this one I really didn't like. Christian Grey is just an abusive man, plain and simple. Yes, he had a traumatic childhood, but that doesn't excuse his overly-controlling behaviour. Really put me off. The only thing I liked was the ending (I don't mean this in a mean way, I really did like the last chapter, it was sweet)
B00002R0MC|5.0|This album does not have everything, and includes some live songs that you may want the studio version of.... (Songs of Freedom for sure), but it is a great way to start a Wailers collection.<br /><br />Respect
B006P0FIGU|4.0|Great version of The Three Musketeers.  Matthew MacFadyen is perfectly cast.  Equal parts comedy and action.  A movie I can watch again and again.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|not what I expected.  had problems setting it up as directions weren't that clear.  wouldn't advise anyone else to buy it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It does what it is supposed to do.Easy to use. I would recommend it! Still using the free version. Not sure if I will upgrade since this one works fine and does what I downloaded it for :)
B00992CF6W|1.0|Amazon is slow on updates. I need 2 updates and I can't get it. Amazon stinks. My friends have the updates but I don't
B00AAX68HG|5.0|So much fun-quite the brain teaser! My 6 year old loves working with me to get all 3 stars. Ads aren't too annoying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am addicted to this game!!!!!! It is so much fun beating my friends on facebook. i<br />I reccomend this to anyone who wants to play it all day!!!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I read this so quickly, it was intriguing and actually fun, despite the title.  I loved the concept of being 75 and able to join the service to fight aliens, and it was well written and thought out.  On to the next in series...
B004YM6JLO|5.0|You either love them or you hate them. I personally love them so exciting and Klaus has got be killed...hahahhah
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|you souled get this app. its like the others but new sharks. gold and gems. gold fish that get you coins. and more better graphics.get it.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie it started out a mobile slow but didn't' t let me down. The producers were really thinking on this one!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Awesome and fast delivery!!!! I am an giving the movie as a gift and it came right on time for me to wrap it and take it to the party!
B000JLSM00|5.0|A beautiful, compelling, insightful work of genius.  I'm not a fan of John Wayne but here he creates a truly complex character for our times.  The Blu-ray is particularly stunning.  Monument Valey is John Ford's palette and he created a master work in all respects.  The supplemental materal is also excellent.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Works well with all of my kindle devices.  Cord could be a bit longer but really have no complaints about product.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|I can't wait for the next season. The finale was amazing. Watch season 1 first if you  haven't seen the show before.
0670022411|2.0|I read a lot of books about vampires, witches, etc as my little guilty pleasure. I've read most all of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles and all of the Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris, for example. This book is not as intellectual as Rice nor as fresh and fun as Harris. It makes humorous reference to popular vampire myth once in a while, but its plot and especially its writing is not inventive. Lots of cliche here and actually poor writing to boot. I was very disappointed. Will definitely not be taking up this trilogy.
0060922583|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for a family member, so I can't really say whether it's good or not. I'm assuming, since my sister hasn't lit it on fire and danced around it, it's pretty decent. Then again, if you tell somebody who got you a gift that it sucks, then that's kinda rude. And she's not rude.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|it's a great show. I love it. You should watch it too. It's Sherlock Holmes, what else is there to say?
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|I started this book with a curiosity that easily slipped to interest once I read the first part. Adichie is a skilled story-teller and that cannot be taken away from her. I grew to appreciate the character and her experience as an immigrant but something about her life didn't resonate with me. I found her too human and not human enough, her life seemed polished. I'd liked for her to be a woman without touting her sexuality. To face the consequence of her actions, to experience life. Hardly thought-provoking but if you're looking for an interesting read, this will do.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great  book how two individuals from two walks of life can inspire each other to move on in their lives in two different directions.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This game takes responsibility for you pets. It is also fun to play with the pets . Though I would change the game just a little bit make it less expensive
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really did not agree with majority if the reviews of this book. I found it was exactly what I waited so many months for.<br /><br />I particularly liked how Eva and Gideon evolved as a couple. They are really starting to open up and face their demons. I am anxious to see what the rest of Gideon's story is, and what happens with Corrine? Brett, and Cary! I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars because I felt that it had just a bit too much raunch. However, I love the heat between Gideon and Eva, but more on how he was falling in love with her would have been nice. Although, I fall more in love with Gideon each time I read about him!
B00847KFDS|3.0|CCR is my favorite of all time. This record just takes some of there best songs and downgrades them. Saw CCR REVISITED<br />Not the same without John Fogerty. They would have never seen a national stage without him. I am sure many millions of fans<br />would like to see them settle their differences. aaaaaaaaa Please guys my soul needs to see you preform together before it is too late.
B00821OX98|5.0|Just found this show a few weeks ago and it's been a great substitute while I await the return of the Walking Dead, similar feel only aliens not zombies!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Really good way to spend a few free minutes<br />One of the best games of Mahjong that I have found :)
0060920084|2.0|Someone here said that Bryson missed an opportunity, and I agree! I have really enjoyed other books by Bryson, because of his well-researched writing. I think he's very good at telling an entertaining story while interspersing with history and facts on the area he's traveling through. But he did not collect facts about any of the places he went through. And, as a person who grew up roadtripping all over small town America, I kind of feel like he did it wrong. Sure there are lots of boring towns and dumpy diners, but the local culture can be also be fun. And much better material for a funny book. Go line-dancing in a country bar, for gods' sake! Don't just go to the visitor's center at a park...hike in the park. Check out a local friday softball league. Eat weird food. Talk to someone you wouldn't usually talk to. He came off as really old and bitter, which is ironic since he wrote the book as a younger man. Definitely a bit disappointed.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I purchased this for my mother-in-law to use with her iPad.  When I asked her how she likes it, she said she loves that it has texture that makes it easy to hold. I had bought her an Alupen originally. The tip eventually came off, so I ordered this stylus because the shape is the same - my mother-in-law needs something chunky - and it comes with an extra tip. Anyway, she has Fibromyalgia and lots of pain in her fingers, so she says she prefers to tap the screen with a stylus rather than her finger tips.  This one isn't slippery and is easier for her to hold. She holds it like you would hold a dry erase marker.  She says it works better than the Alupen.  I don't think she uses it to write, so I can't say how well it works in that way. Thus the four stars. .
B00003CXD5|5.0|I love watching this star perform in just about anything. I am starting a DVD collection of his movies.This is a great story of desperation and greed and Mr. Bogart gives a great performance and I enjoy the change of his character as the gold dust fever hits.Could one expect any less from a star who also convinced me that he was a paranoid captain on a Navy ship in another movie.I can hardly wait to own The Maltese Falcon and all the other great movies this person has made.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Fantasy through the eyes of an older generation.<br />A great read for those who like to be humoured  and revived
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R.R. Martin has the most amazing imagination and a true gift for telling a tale that keeps you wanting it to never end. Many memorable characters and his descriptions of the lands they inhabit are creative, frightening and also beautiful. Difficult book to put down.
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|Wish I had seen it on the big screen,but unfortunately I had seen part of it on T.V.. The part that got me is watching Henry Fonda`s performance as a cold heartless killer. Now after watching from beginning to end in my widescreen T.V., I found myself lost in a great story with great performance by all the cast and of course Sergio Leone lives up to the reputation of making great westerns (Good,Bad,Ugly etc.) I`ve seen Clint Eastwood on the big screen in the spaghetti western I just mentioned and I own the DVD of the same and this movie is as good,maybe better than the clint flicks.I will not get tired of watching these movies.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|excellent movie my son told me about it the courage and strength and determination and family bonding is aspiring love it
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Love this movie! I laughed my head off! I even cried a little. Worth the 13.99 I paid for it!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I only rented this to look @ Jennifer Lawrence.  I don't get how  everyone was talking about this movie it's not that good.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Some of the very best of the very best group ever! All Beatles lovers will certainly enjoy this great spectrum of Beatles' gems!It is a wonderful golden trip...from \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"The Long And Winding Road!\\"
0763644765|5.0|My 20month little girl loves this book! She wants to look at the pictures while she sits on the potty!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|One night when I could not get to sleep (again) I decided to rent this. I enjoyed the story,the acting, Tom hanks is one of my favorite actors. I usually don't care for Halle Berry, but she was ok in this one. I would watch it again
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Time use it all the Time just wish the gems cost a little less that's it overall it's a great game to play at work lol
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I've not seen this movie for years. I've begun collecting great movies that I saw as a kid, and this was on my wish list.<br /><br />Just like any movie, it does what they are supposed to do - take you away. I was immersed just like when I first saw it and cracked up because Michael Keaton is hilarious in this movie. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are so young (younger looking). I had not realized this, but Tim Burton directed this. As a kid I would have never have guessed it, but you know his sense of style and it is everywhere here.<br /><br />This is one I know I am going to watch over and over again, and not get sick of it. Great movie!
B0015HOFZI|2.0|Broken dust cover, I could have overlooked that and to a point I did. then I decoded to give it a shot & avoid all the hassle of returning something. Assembled it put on a record and it seemed to play fine. then side A ended as the arm tried to get back to the post at starting position, it scratched the hell out of my The Wall album thanks to a crooked plate.  I guess if it was not damaged during shipping it would be an ok turntable.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I Totally enjoyed this book.  The descriptions of his experience were so well written I could visualize each experience as he described it.  I felt I was on the journey with him.  I have read several books about experiences afterlife and feel this the very best book I have read on this subject.  I think his comparision of thinking between a Doctor and a non medical person was so very interesting.  I would and have recommended this book to several of my friends.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|In the 70s, my dad and Uncle used to read books and get into the whole weightlifting scene back then. One of his favorites, among a lot of the guys then - was and still is Arnold.<br /><br />When this came in, he was surprised I'd gotten it and told him I'd remembered the huge Weider book he had that looked older than me, and how I thought he would like seeing all of the weightlifting studs of the day on the set.<br /><br />He'd popped it in and you could tell it was like turning back the clock, the way he named off the weightlifters back then, which guys were cool, which guys were dirty or just immature towards others, and he would tell me quick stories of what they did. It was interesting.<br /><br />I'd gotten into watching with him and it is a great movie to share with someone who enjoyed, or anyone for that matter, the age of the body builder and Arnold, someone who has a knack with people (the prison scene) - you can see why he was very popular back then.<br /><br />The quality was great, and am grateful I bought it so I could share something like it with my dad.
B003XQM2YU|3.0|will not go into much detail about the movie (I don't think people need the whole plot line of the movie).  It stars Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett. It is a different take on the usual Robin Hood story. That was pretty interesting and the re-creation of the middle ages was nicely done.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***.  At least one eye rolling scene where Cate Blanchett leads a bunch of kids (armed with sharpened sticks) against professional soldiers armed with shields and swords.  I mean come on.  To the movie's credit , it doesn't show these stick fighters kicking a$$ but it doesn't show them getting slaughtered either. I bought the kids living alone and marauding passers-by in Sherwood and even found it kinda interesting but hand to hand combat in open ground with better equipped and better trained soldiers??? Didn't buy that one.<br /><br />bottom line- all in all ,not bad.  Worth renting but not buying.
B0035JNRXU|5.0|A bit more &#34;love&#34; scenes than I have come to find in most star treks so was surprised sitting with the kids - but nothing too bad...  Anyway, as I said, good as always
1451696191|5.0|I loved it. I cried in some parts. This book is just as good as the movie. Recommend this book.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|3 stars for story line.  5 stars for cinematography.  The cgi and the cinematography were awesome, story line was ok.  If you're into LOTR stuff you're going to watch this movie anyways no matter how many stars I give it.<br /><br />my movie rating system<br />1-2 stars - don't waste your time<br />3 stars - rent don't buy<br />4 stars - would watch again<br />5 stars - would watch again several times<br /><br />bottom line - Good movie. loved the look of the movie much more than the content of it.  Worth renting and maybe worth buying if you're a LOTR fan.
B002GHHHKQ|1.0|I thought I bought the DVD and only opened the case recently from February.....threw it away .  I think you should be more specific...about what you are selling.....
B00594XOZU|5.0|it is amazing and great and it is a grate way to hang with friends I love it so much
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Never watched this show when it was on tv... but I am loving it... has more twists and turns than the Following (which I also love!) you never know who to trust... and the characters are all very well developed and each has their own personality... just a very well thought out and developed show... definitely recommend it... and I've only watched 3/4 of the first season so far!!!
B003Y01JL2|5.0|Gave this to a young person just beginning her vinyl collect, she loves it. Wish there was more available on amazon.
B000YMM3CC|3.0|Actors played their parts very well.  The storyline was true to life.  The problem is there can hardly be a good ending to such a sad situation.  I am 75 and have lost my wife to cancer which affects my feelins about such a movie.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I love to listen to the music and see in my mind all the things that happened in the movie during each part of it.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is an amazing series. They really have modernized Sherlock Holmes into a believable and interesting way. The actors are fantastic, the writing is top notch and the last episode will have you desperately wondering when Season 3 will be out!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really great game. It is really fun to play. Except there is one problem. In the new update, when I tried to put a sign down, my kindle would freeze and then get all black. If you get the game and this happens to you, all you have to do is shut your kindle off, wait for a little while, then turn it back on. This is a really great game, just don't use the signs.
1421550644|5.0|I loved the movie and now I have the great luck to be able to find out so much more then the movie had to offer. If you love ghibili or just Nausicaa BUY THIS BOOK!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|love this game.  would have given it a 5 star rating if it was easier to get the pearls without paying for them.
B007SGM084|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! I am obsessed with this book!<br /> I can't wait for the movie!!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|i love being british for a moment<br />I was missing watching something while downton abbey was off air...this fits the bill
B0022Q8CSC|3.0|If you like the Godfather movies, this is a good read. Gives much more insight to the characters in the movie.  The book does have some Interesting differences from the movie.<br /><br />I only give it 3 stars because I actually liked the movie more than the book, which is unusual.
1616550414|5.0|This is a great book for those who love Zelda games! Detailed descriptions, nice illustrations, quite large and hardcover binding.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I like the game. I got for my daughter but it was a little hard for her. I am starting to like it mitght get 5 stars when I figure out
0061950726|4.0|Such a wonderful book about a few fictionalized accounts of those who rode the \\"Orphan Train\\" in the early 20th century. This novel follows the journey of 9 year old Irish immigrant Niamh, whose parents die suddenly in an all too common tenement fire in NYC. Niamh is soon whisked away onto the Orphan Train by well meaning Protestants where she realized because she is not a healthy older boy nor a toddler, she is not wanted. Niamh tells her story as a 91 year old woman to another foster child named Molly in 2011, whose story parallels Niamh's. I would say this novel does not lean toward the overly dramatic, nor did I feel the author was trying to manipulate my emotions by in essence writing a story that is read between the lines like this: \\"Oh, you poor orphan! FEEEEL for the orphans of 100 years ago! What a travessstyyy!\\" I have read too many novels like that, and it takes a talented novelist to write something that does not become trapped into that pitfall. Instead of bookish emotional manipulation, Ms Kline writes emotively and lyrically. Recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A great TV series. It sprickles in moments in history that i was unaware of.  Good acting.  I never realized how rich these people must have been and how out of touch they were with thle 'common' folk.  Also if you 'google' Downton Abbey you can learn interestering facts about the Abbey and it history.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I will try not to go on a rant. I pre-ordered this book because I couldn't wait to see how Gideon and Eva concluded things. I paid $9.99 for this filler book. If the author decided to stretch the story a bit, fine. However,  this book should have been priced for less. I'd say $3.99. I'm a pretty fast reader and it took me a week to read this one. Basically, the author wrote the same 10 sentences over and over in different ways. Very very dissapointed. Huge let down for the price we the readers had to pay.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I was a little concerned about how the series would be modernized, but the movie stuck to the tradition of Star Trek while making it fresh.  I enjoyed the 'back story' of how the crew came together, though I'll admit that following the story line was a bit challenging.  Good movie overall and looking forward to the next film.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Twenty years later, second time read, still one of the best stories ever written.  What a talent Mr. Clavell had.  IT
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super fun game.  Love that they update the game all the time.  Would be nice if the special collection items showed up more often when playing!!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Addicting but not complicated enough needs to be a nascar game with jeff Gordon  go 24 he should've crashed bowyer again and Jimmie Johnson
B000A2H8WQ|5.0|This is a winner.  An oldy but goody that you would really like and would too.  Two thumbs<br />up and then some.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOVE Minecraft I have it on my Xbox. But one thing on mobile devices nothing is as Detailed. But it's also very expensive but it is worth it. I highly recommend this app fun to play when your bored and occupying for everyone.Overall I highly recommend it to you.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game has great fx and graphics. Oranginalplan did a lot better on this version. Looking forward to more updates!! Thanks Oranginalplan!! Your the best
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|New vehicles and levels with upgrades for each machine keep us coming back for more. While it would be nice to be able to detune the 4x4 and downforce setting after you've purchased the upgrade most vehicles work well when completely decked out. Great fun for everyone!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I found the series cool.  To think how far we have come with digital creatures and.  what would the series have been like with today's technology.  Still, a great show and am looking forward to completing seaso 2.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Hey this game is great but it's pretty hard it makes me just wanna **** my kindle. But that's the fun part get it plz it's soooo fun.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|We most thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It may get a little intense at parts for small children but overall it is a great family adventure. Pop some Popcorn, sit back with the surround sound turned up and enjoy the ride.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Yes, it's the usual good vs. evil but with some added twists: how to keep your humanity when faced with difficult times (a lesson we all could benefit from), are the perceived bad guys really the bad guys?  And so much more.  Riveting.
0399160450|5.0|I love all books by Tom Clancy, and this book is no exception.  For this novel, Tom teamed with Mark Greany who has trained with military and law enforcement in the use of firearms, battlefield medicine, and close-range combat tactics.
B008OE05IG|5.0|Really nice little film about Jiro, the sushi master, and the family issues bubbling around him.  Very inspirational in a very zen-like way.
B000SEIDR0|3.0|I thought this book would be more informative.  I was somewhat disappointed.  I cannot recommend it to others to read.
B008D563IC|2.0|Compared to American Wedding it was aweful! They brought back all the people that really couldn't act and the movie took a bunch of highly serious turns! I fell asleep! Save your money and watch American Wedding over and over, it's the best!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I didn't believe a word of this, and I think its problem lay in its author's decision to write it in the first person.  Its tone and level of vocabulary wobbles between damaged teen and savvy adult-writer; its payoff, rendered through the voice of its oblivious narrator, comes too late to redeem all the lugubrious drippiness we've had to endure.  There's nothing wrong with using a narrator whose voice is compromised by one thing or another (and is, therefore, &#34;unreliable&#34;).  But when the narrator is a teenager whose main character component is his unawareness, you end up with a pseudo-&#34;naive&#34; study in disingenuousness.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I watched this when it aired originally and loved it (I saw the Apollo 11 launch live in Florida).  I got this version since it was widescreen DVD.  Too bad no Blu-Ray available.
B009NT0I06|5.0|This is a great album from Taylor and listening to it on vinyl makes it even that much richer of a sound.
B00BC55S7M|2.0|To get started, I must state that I love Iced Earth. Which, unfortunately, will make this review painful.<br /><br />I can honestly only recommend this live DVD/Blu-ray to people who are die hard Iced Earth fans. The reason? Block's voice. While he sounds great on the album, he does not do well here at all. It is hard to describe how his voice sounds, but comparing it to a 12 year old boy would not be unwarranted. If you don't believe me, buy it. You will most likely regret it. His voice shows none of the power that is present on Iced Earth's latest offering, Dystopia. That major issue, combined with the fact that the sound of the pyrotechnics occasionally cover the sound of Stu's voice (blessing or curse? I cannot decide) makes this a not-so-great purchase. You would be better off borrowing this from a friend, or simply sticking with older Iced Earth DVDs, such as Alive in Athens, or even Festivals of the Wicked.<br /><br />At first I was extremely excited for this new singer, but if their live shows are all going to be a repeat of Live in Ancient Kourion, then I have no choice but to find myself a new band.
B0012GMVVW|5.0|Buy a latter-day masterpiece for $4.99!<br />Bowie's just a few years older than yours truly. I was a HUGE fan of him and his music in the 70s. Then came Let's Dance and Blue Jean and my interest waned. This is undeniably mature work, with a dark side to be sure, but the retro-levity of Gemini Spacecraft, for instance, is certainly welcome. There are 3 covers here and their selection is indicative of the album's wide range overall. Probably his best music since the 70s, it seems kind of effortlessly likable but of course effortless it was not. Very Bowie, and if you decide not to do an oldies thing, this is probably the one for you.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Loads right up on Kindle HD. Excellent radar zoom and vibrancy of the radar. Love the hourly and daily charts. Excellent free app.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I like how the book was written. You see it from a  man's point of view than that of a woman's. The story is shallow, quite predictable really but its an easy read. Its funny and the sex scenes are not as awful as 50 shades though this book also took a couple of chapters talking about sex alone. though it gets a little dragging when Drew started to pursue Kate, nonetheless its ok. this can actually be made into a romantic comedy similar to \\"whats your number\\"
B005HED11Y|5.0|Of course The Original Series itself is awesome. But I was glad to see the awesome HD remastering and the quality streaming. The show had my undivided attention.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Slammed is an interesting read cuz it introduces you to the world of slammed poetry. the twist between the character is also engrossing. all in all  its a pretty good read especially if you internalize the poems written.<br /><br />however, don't bother reading point of retreat and that girl (sequence to slammed) because both are a total waste of time
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Drama at its' best and Kiefer Sutherland nails his character. I was sorry to see this series go and was disappointed that it really did not have an ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever! Please buy it. The price may be be a bit pricey, but it is as we o.e! Realistic zombies, skeletons, creepers,and spiders. Plenty of animals too
B00622B3MY|5.0|The kids loved it and so did I, I can watch it over and over and not get bored. yes
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it is so much fun it allows you to create everything and anything you want la
B003QSMCKO|5.0|I loved the story line and it touches every parents heart, we want our kids to be all they can be.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|I had the VHS of this and am so happy they finally put out on DVD....great show, sound and set list.....also the history of Iron Maiden part 3!! get this !!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|The plots started getting more involved and hard to follow.  That is why I didn't give it a five star
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I bought this device for my iPod Classic which did not have bluetooth capabilites from years ago. I wanted a wireless headphone set to use in the gym and needed the KOKKIA  to connect to it. It works like a charm! While it will drain the power on the iPod a little, I can still get about four hours of use before I have to charge the iPod. This is a really nice device.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three of these books in 6 days. I have bought 2 additional copies for friends. Highly recommended easy read, might also spice up  your sex life :)
B002O2THRO|5.0|Sound and picture quality are excellent aside from the fact that this movie was produced in the 70s.  Excellent movie!!
193609648X|5.0|This is not your typical crochet book, its better.  Lots of variety and the patterns don't look like your grandma's granny square stuff.  And of course, the yarn is delicious!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|If you like the movie you will LOVE the book. It is pretty similar but like always the book is better. The characters are easy to like and it is an easy read.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Many stories, same faces with makeup, but a story than never seemed to hang to the other. Honestly did not like it
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The good news is that with all the negative reviews, Day will end the series with four books. I enjoyed the book.  No, not as good as the first two, but come on it wasn't that bad.  I guess some people take fake characters WAY too serious.  I get it, the book was $10 and you want a good read, but dang some of these reviews were written as if the characters  were actual people and it impacted their personal lives.<br /><br />Readers complained there were too many sex scenes...REALLY?  What kind of book do you think you're purchasing?  No more raunchiness than the other \\"mommy porn\\" books.  Do what I do, just skim over the section(s).  Lighten up.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I thought the series was very good and I'm glad it was renewed by FOX.  I'm glad that Amazon give me access to the old episodes.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Want to have fun and a challenging time, play this game that allows you to unlock colored squares and very similar to bejeweled. I find the levels addictive and spend way to much time with it, I can't put it down
B000IDEQTK|5.0|The story line was interesting and realistic.  The acting was very good.  The audio and cinematography was excellent. I especially liked the lack of violence and foul language  which is so common in so  many movies today.
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|The story is very kid friendly. the animation is fantastic. the music is wonderful. Cant stop watching it. One of the best Disney movies made.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A real page turner which was unpredictable  at every turn. Reminds me a little of the movie \\"we need to talk about Kevin\\".
B004UFEJVW|4.0|Really enjoyed the story. A movie made for young kids. The animation was excellent. I highly recommend for all ages.
B004G6009K|5.0|I really didn't need the 3D blu-ray, regular blu-ray (yet at least) or the digital copy, but considering it was on sale when I bought it for about the same as DVD or DVD/Blu-Ray pack. You can't go wrong with that.
0446581348|3.0|It's a nice, looks great decorating my bathroom but  very little help for someone that wants to learn how to apply make up.
B007HACDLK|5.0|What can I say? I like the series and the characters.  They seem a little short but that doesn't  stop me from buying them.  If you like this type of story its a good read.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|If you want to be make up artist this is an ah-mazing  game for girls who want to be make up artist definitely buy it and the best part is that its free!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Read it In one day :) couldn't stop reading it, best book I have read in a long time.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|this was an awsome movie.  the grafices were out of this world.  i will be telling all my friends about this movie. it is a must see and a must own movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game can keep you occupied that's for sure. Love the fact that it's also free. You will not be disappointed
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this APP because it is super quick. I do not have to log in, I just press the button and there are all my emails! Viola!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite of the three. Even though it shares similar concepts & overall plot with the 1st book, Collins still manages to bring ingenuity to this book that really sets it apart as it's own story as well.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's a bit complicated at first but stick with it. Once you've got your head round it its pretty cool.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Although this book is very graphic, it is an astonishing love story. I could not put the book down. Highly recommended reading.
0062014536|3.0|I devoured the first two books in the Delirium Trilogy and could hardly wait to get the 3rd book.  I had high expectations for the 3rd book - what would happen between Alex, Lena and Julian?  Would the \\"invalids\\" win the war?  If you are hoping to get answers to these questions like I was you will be disappointed.  There is a lot of fighting in this book between the \\"cureds\\" and the \\"invalids\\".  However, most of it felt like it was filling pages.  It didn't add anything to the story line.  I found myself struggling to get through the book - it was toward the end of the book that I felt like it started picking up.  Like alot of other reviewers, I was disappointed in the ending - it was abrupt, almost like it was leaving an opening for a fourth book.  I think Ms. Oliver should have started the 3rd book about 2/3 of the way into this book and then actually go into what happened after Lena rescued Grace.  I would not buy this book again - if you feel that you have to read it - just borrow it and save your money.
1490313370|2.0|For old fans of Altucher's work, the book has nothing new to say. After reading about 50% I can say that almost (or maybe every) story or chapter I have read looked familiar. It is so because all of the chapters were published on Altucher's successful blog for free. I hope to encounter something new in the next 50% of the book but I guess that won't be the case.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This transaction was quick and easy and the book was a decent read. It's very easy to download and want to read more.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was not want I expected and help my interest throughout the story line. Highly recommended for teens and adults.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is a really fun game I wouldn't recommend it to people who like fast and easy games If you like to relax and play a long game this is for you. I didn't buy the full version I got the free one and it still is fun either you buy it or not.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This is a taut and gripping thriller. Well made and acted about extricating diplomats from Iran under the guise of a departing science fiction film crew.<br /><br />The tension builds up nicely with some good humorous moments, mainly from John Goodman. I have to say that the numerous cliff hangers makes for superb viewing!<br /><br />Like a lot of movies, the facts are often victims of the drama. In the film the CIA states that the hostages were rejected by the Brits and the Kiwis. That is not true. The Brits did take them in and it was only when the British embassy itself faced being stormed that they were moved to the Canadians. Why so many movies select to distort facts unnecessarily is a mystery? it debases the film.<br /><br />Likewise, we had some Canadian guests who had refused to see the film on the basis that most of the work was done by the Canadians, for which the credit was hi jacked by the CIA in the movie. So, what's new? But it remains a gripping movie.
B008D37SGU|4.0|Enjoyed this movie so much. Definitely think this is one of Tom's best performances. Could not stop crying at the end.
0307271080|5.0|I loved this book. I read the whole thing in 24 hours, she's a terrific writer and the story is set up so well. The blogging is integrated seamlessly into the novel and I found it not didactic but fascinating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You never get bored endless fun. Updates always come in so it keeps<br />getting better and better take my word for it there's so much awesome<br />things you can do. Please get it it is totally worth it.<br /><br />  Also follow jbernhardsson on Twitter he's the creator<br />  he runs all the updates so you can catch up what's happening.<br /><br />:)
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|As a fan of the table top version, this is a fine solitaire version fit for a tablet format.  If I could change one or two things, I would love to have a multiplayer setup and have a way to play the unmodified game from the table top version, but as is, this app already rocks your sanity like a Mi-go at a kareoke bar!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the second book i have read by this author and I knew that his first one was so good so I ordered this book without thinking twice about it being good. I am not disappointed at all and wish i had the time to sit to read it and not have to put it down.I was involved in it from the start.It should stay on the &#34;BEST SELLER LIST&#34;.
B000002O5L|5.0|My cassette is wearing out.  This album is a classic, why would I need to justify buying it?  If you are a Petty fan and you do not yet have this you are not really complete.
B001ZRYQSO|1.0|I didnt mean to download it on my phone. I dont like jazz like that. I erased it from my cloud.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|For the price I paid for this classic movie, it was a steal. I have this movie in VHS. I was waiting for the price of the Blue Ray version to come down. What a price drop  Very satisfied.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|JULIA MIGUENES AND PLACIDO DOMINGO EMBODY THESE GREAT OPERATIC ROLES AND IT IS BEAUTIFULLY REALIZED THROUGHOUT.  CAN WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!!  TO MY MIND ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF AN OPERA I HAVE EVER SEEN!
B004AKCME8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It is well made with a very good story. It got better the more I watched it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|The statistics and facts make this book stand out from the rest.<br /><br />I suggest any male working with or managing women or with daughters read this book to gain a better understanding!
B001F12J0C|5.0|This is an action packed movie that I think just about anyone would enjoy. I have watched it multiple times.
B000Q76K24|5.0|My husband loved this but it was too violent for me......it was the second time that we have watched it.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Dan Brown really forces the dialogue in this novel, and I found it to be disingenuous. Interesting historical references, but would not pay for this again.
034580404X|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this series.  I was expecting it to be all about an innocent young woman being drawn into a life of being a submissive.  I only read these books because someone I trust told me I had to read them.  Based on all the hype about these books, I was sure I was going to hate them.  The whole Dominant/Submissive thing just goes completely against everything I believe in.  This turned out to be a well written and VERY erotic story and I had a difficult time putting it down.  I was a little disappointed that the sex was mostly skipped over in the third book though.  I am sure I will enjoy this series even more the second time around since I will catch things that I am sure I missed the first time.<br /><br />** Warning ** These books are not for people that are squeamish about graphic descriptive sex!
B0045INOCO|3.0|This is the hollow movie<br />This is the stuffed movie,<br />Scenes leaning together,<br />Themes stuffed with straw.<br />The dry narratives,<br />One after another,<br />Are quiet and meaningless,<br />As wind in dry grass,<br />Or rats' feet over broken glass,<br />In our dry celler.<br /><br />Scenes without meaning, over powered with color,<br />Paralyzed story, gesture without emotion.<br /><br />Those who have watched it with their own eyes,<br />And passed on to death's other kingdom,<br />Remember it, if at all, not as a great movie,<br />Violent scenes, but still<br />As a hollow movie,<br />The stuffed movie.<br /><br />I don't get it, so I must be stupid.  The coolest part of the movie was the battle with the guys surfing in the background.  \\"Fight up here, or surf back there\\"!  Much more could have been done with that, like some Beach Boys music.  So basically the movie is: Charlie Sheen is ordered to assassinate Marlon Brando, who is a rogue American officer with a personal band of followers in Cambodia.  Charlie Sheen is constantly \\"thinking out loud\\", voice over narrative, and the movie tries to get into \\"what makes people tick\\".  And of course, it's about the horrors of war.  But its like the movie asks questions, but never tries to give answers.  There's lots of dramatic presentation, but not much substance.  It's fiction, people say how it's just like Viet Nam, but were there any rogue American officers with their own band of followers in Viet Nam?  The movie never addresses how Marlon Brando is able to keep such a loyal following, other than \\"he reads poetry aloud\\".  He reads TS Elliot's \\"The Hollow Men\\", which is about how unimportant people are, and he's always in his room feeling depressed.  Depressed because of all the little arms that were chopped off, did anything like that ever happen in Viet Nam?  If so, that might make a good movie.  I just don't get how people can call this a classic, it's almost like they don't get it but don't want to look stupid so they don't admit it.<br /><br />If you like \\"war is horrible\\" movies, you might like it, I just don't get it.o look stupid so they don't admit it.<br /><br />If you like \\"war is horrible\\" movies, you might like it, I just don't get it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved this book and it's pseudo diary/journalistic format. The only thing that made me put it down in the 3 days it took to read was the inability to fight off sleep any longer. Sadly, the movie won't follow the book format so my hopes are low for movie (still looks cool though) and I'm thinking I should have read the book after seeing it so I'd be less disappointed (presumably). If you're into the whole emerging Zombie thing, you'll love this book.It's intelligent, exciting and has a believably realistic approach.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Mrs. Thatcher was a great lady for her country. The movie made her out as a delusional old lady. Yes, maybe she developed Alzheimer in her older years but why make it the center of the movie?  Of course because of how she turned her country into a GREAT country and got rid of socialism, the left had to make her a crazy lady, they want people to think capitalism is something crazy people do.  HOW SAD!
B009X01ELC|5.0|I had purchased another case for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It did not work with the new Kindle HD 8.9 because you had to keep plugging and unplugging the charging cable if you wanted to use the Kindle plugged in. The Marware version you can use with cables plugged in in any position Port/Land without unplugging them. I often use the Kindle to play shows in bed at night. I had purchased a Marware case for my first Kindle Fire and I should have kept with that company because although a little more expensive, they are a better and a well thought out design.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|I was very happy with the time it took to receive my order. I have finished watching the whole second season a few weeks ago and it was in excellent condition. No scratches or even smudges on the disks I was very satisfied with the product I go :D
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The best new law series. I have watched each week since beginning and being able to review the entire series is excellent and well worth Amazon Prime cost.
1616614609|5.0|The title says it all, I love the game, I love the art, I love the deckbuilding, I love the lack of &#34;rares&#34;. It's an awesome game, a little bit of a learning curve, but once you get it, it's AWESOME.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved reconnecting with the characters but disappointed that all questions and troubles were not cleared up but added new issues that are now also mixed in. Feel his was just a tease book....nothing but teasers from page one. Feel ripped off, not sure I will continue with this series as Sylvia is just dragging it out and not giving her readers any ending to any of the issues.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This series takes you on a roller coaster of realms! The intro always peaks your interest. What a great ride!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy how this show has so many aspects that are developing all at once. I am excited to see more seasons.
B009CSIK44|5.0|mauling and abusing polymer clay in a frustrating manner suddenly assumed structure with this well written book.  I followed the tips - assembled the tools and produced a neanderthal man my first time out of the box -  Several attempts later, I have refined my efforts and achieved modern man - I am happy
0671449028|5.0|I purchased this book when my daughter was 6 months old. Since the book is hard cover and the pages are also hard, initially i was  very careful giving it to her when she would want to play with it.Although the edges are rounded off but it would still hurt the baby coz of its hard(ness)...however, now that my daughter is 8.5 months she loves this book.Literally she'll pick this book from the bunch of other books!<br />as a side note, i atleast yawn 3 times every time we finish reading it...haha!!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Good story...hope it is not too true.  As I like all of DeMille's writings I was not disappointed.  I highly suggest that you red this book.
B008Y5FNL4|2.0|Known to be a &#34;Classic&#34;; pretty boring. NO direction in plot. Drawn out-.acting not great, except a young Sheen did well. Brando barely existed in the movie- weird he gets the acclaim. He was despicably overpaid for this lackluster role.<br />Good camera and framing work, however.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love it. I completely adore Khaled Hosseini so many emotions. It's just beautiful and perfect. Everyone should read it. You won't regret it for sure! I already was having mixed emotions on the 15th page! Lmao
B003DS3GC0|2.0|Most interesting piece of this movie is that it is a true story, allegedly unscripted with Hollywood overtones: and the ending verbiage explaining the outcomes of all  pointedly shows the deception of the local governing entities in denial these things do, did, and likely still go on behind razor fenced facilities of any kind.
0425263924|5.0|another of sylvia day's master pieces, don't get any work done when i pick her books up.  so far i believe i have all her books and am looking for more.  thank you
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so very addicting. Hard to put down the kindle ! Love everything about it. Even my husband will play along.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Dont work to well very limited search . Its to limited search and dont work to well ,I will delete it .
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I do not understand their decision to raise the prices along with separating the formats.  Adding hours upon hours of extended, never before seen clips that no one really watches does not justify the cost.  Give me the combo option found with past Disney releases.  Not everyone wants to watch it on a 3D TV all the time. I will have to pass on this one and any other movie they decide to charge double for the same movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have never found a game more challenging and I can't wait until you all make a new one. I am looking forward to it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app that helps me pass the time when I am waiting around for transportation.  Lots of fun to play.
B000SL1Q2C|1.0|Not only would it not load, but I didn't realize it was not in English - - had subtitles.  Very disappointing.  Hadn't seen this movie in more than 30 years and really wanted to see it.  Guess it's just not made except maybe in Europe.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Written in beautiful old fashioned English prose. I loved it. Although it does showy vampires in a very negative light, unlike current literature. Well worth reading.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I forced myself to watch this film to the end, hoped it would get better. Never did. Just too many Tom Hanks running around.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Kindle Fire HD use with school server systems and easy saving and file organization of word documents and power points from teachers for quick reference!
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Seems to celebrate bad people, while condemning those who try to do what is right. A vast majority of FBI and Government employees are quite bright, highly educated and in fact lead righteous lives. One bad act should not justify an even greater one.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I was hooked when I first played Quell. Quell Reflect was a welcomed, refreshing spin on the original. Memento is continuing in that tradition with new concepts, layout, and interface. Utterly superb, and hope they continue the series and continue to surprise with each release!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I love this series! It is so entertaining. I love the dynamics! I watch it all the time. It never fails to catch and hold my interest.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is hard and fun.<br />my brother likes it too.<br />my mom does not like it.<br />my dad does not like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book while moving across country.  The story was well balanced and entertaining, mixing the action sequences and relationship plot together.  A great escape during a very busy time.
B0053O89JM|5.0|this came in the wrapper, nice and crisp, no problem with any discs, and a good price too :D bravo.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Exellent entertainment.  I loved every minute of the seasons of Downtown Abbey I've watched to date, looking forward to more episodes.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I would give it a 5 except you cannot have the lid closed and charge at the same time.  I just put my Kindle in upside down of their recommendation. This only affects a few apps, mainly games. I just deal with it so the lid can close while charging, which to me is more important.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Very good show, hoping Season Two is even better.  A bit like Downton Abby, quite similar for sure.  Like it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|A good way to keep track of the battery life of my kindle it gives me a choice in keeping using it or should I charge it.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Great value, my 3 year old loves the Toy Story movies and I bought this set for $38 for all 3 movies. Individually, I checked Walmart and Target and the cheapest I could find was $20 apiece. I would recommend this and it is blue ray so the quality is very clear and bright.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game it is awesome! I wish there were more games like them but unfortunately there isn't keep giving us these great games to play!!!! 5 star!!!!
B0014DFCMS|5.0|I got this movie for my boyfriend for xmas. He loves Ellen Page and he was delighted to have this movie on blu ray!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like the game nice details the game is cool so far no problems try it and see if you like it :)
193700788X|5.0|I really liked the whole Sookie series and am sad that this is the last book. However I was happy with the ending. Great buy for those who love the series.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is a lot better than I thought n my little boy likes it too, so that's good(: I'm glad I got it, now I can't stop playing it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This  is better than the first one because you get  m1a1 carbine (aka m1 Grant)<br />A lunger German pistol a few more guns would do I recommend it because if you love information about the world wars  you would get it
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game was so fun! I loved the way it had all the steps to becoming a princess. The only problem I had was that you had to pay 2.99 to,get half the stuff but I did and it was worth it! Take my advice and buy this game you won't regret it!
0802473156|5.0|I would recommed this book to anyone having issues or struggling with a marriage. I has some really good tips.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book was amazing, the writing was absolutely beautiful, Lauren Oliver's writing style made me really understand Lena and what she was going through. And I also understood the other characters.<br />This book was great :), I didn't really like the ending at first, but then I realized why it ended that way, and I  am just so exited to read pandemonium!!!!!<br />Lauren Oliver is now my favourite author!!! YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK, ITS A BEAUTIFUL STORY, AND LOVE STORY TO.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|read it in no time!<br />can't wait for the next book of the series...<br /><br />strongly recommended to anyone who like to read
B008I34Z3Y|5.0|Well what can I say, I have many of their albums, including some timeless classics such as Into the Labyrinth, SpiritChaser and Aion. So finally a new release from them, will it live up to expectations? In my humble opinion the answer is yes. Give it a listen online and decide for yourself. As to the quality of the vinyl release it is high quality, with a clean, flat surface, and a very smooth sound. I find myself playing this during those times I just want to kick back and relax. Be sure to check out &#34;Return of the She-King&#34;.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really liked this book and think it is the best book of the series yet. It was really great
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I purchased this for my Synology NAS. This was a very cost effective solution for adding an additional 2 Gb of RAM to the NAS. Installation was a breeze and the RAM was recognized by the system immediately. Recommended
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Simply put, this game is very addictive. It has decent graphics, it's fun/entertaining, and a good way to kill time. One of the best free apps I've gotten.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Too much jump cutting.  Typical of most action movies today it is designed for the short attention span of young gamers.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|It's ok but unfortunately it can't open the hidden camera anymore. Though I can use Kinde fire hd camera to take picture but can't use it for recording video.
B00499NHLC|5.0|We are fans of the TV show Elementary so decided to watch Sherlock. We actually liked it better and will definitely watch again. The characters were so engaging. I was taken in by Watson even more than Sherlock. What kept us glued to the set was the amazing plot. We always enjoy a little competition to see who can figure things out first, but we did not have a clue on this episode until the very end - when the writers wanted us to. I get frustrated with too complicated plots that leave me confused, but this one was just right - challenging but not frustratingly so. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000002TLX|5.0|I have enjoyed Marx's music for many years and this CD brings me all of his major hits for a fantastic listening experience.  He is a master at pulling your heartfelt emotions into both the lyrics and music in each and every song.  All of the music is studio quality, crisp , clear and each note precise.  There is no way that you can listen to this CD without being swept away either to the past or to recent memories in your life.  If you are a Marx fan you must have this CD in your collection!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved this book and have read it twice already and will probably read it many more times.  Read it if you get the chance
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subwaysurfers is a fun and exciting game to get. It's so fun,and is just like Temple Run I would rate it a 5-star rating.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|IT HAS A GOOD STORY. HAS BEAUTIFUL SCENES.  BUT, THE ACTORS WERE NOT AT THEIR BEST. I MIGHT WATCH IT AGAIN. THE BEGINING WILL SURPRISE YOU. ENJOY
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Sometimes it's good to read a book that will get your mind off of reality and have you falling in-love with two different but very real people.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The book was slow in the beginning end got very interesting and couldn't put it down. The Irish language was a little hard to read but all in all excellent. I would definitely recommend this book.
0307950654|4.0|Ms. James has written a murder mystery around Pemberly, involving some of our villian characters and our favorite couple.  I didn't guess whodunit until nearly the end, and I won't spoil your fun by telling.  You will enjoy this!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Very fun and realistic world war two gun simulator. This is absolutely heaven for ww2 buffs like me. The only problem is the lack of guns.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft  cost lower then $10 and there are 3 versions of it Xbox,or(the one I'm telling about right now) and the best one pc.I am not saying this version of the game is bad but it has more stuff.BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!
B001XUT6AG|3.0|I am a fan of the original movies and the original series. If you are too, this is certainly a departure from that kind of Star Trek &#34;feel&#34;. It is still a good, entertaining movie with better special effects, but you don't have the old James T Kirk you will remember.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Yes very nice set to have all together instead of one here and there.  I would suggest the whole set to any Harry Potter lover.
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|This is a true classic? Even if you aren't a baseball fan, you will find something to enjoy about this movie. Especially since a lot of the styles of the era are coming back (which certainly made me laugh). Its pretty much a grown up Sandlot of sorts. It has a lot a classic comedy with a whole lot more mixed in
0920668372|5.0|This is still the greatest book ever for kids.  I got this book for my 1st child 31 years ago.  The tradition has went down to my 2nd child and all 3 of my grandchildren now.  As I have more grandkids in the future I will get them one also and hope my kids' kids pass it on.
B0091REZMW|4.0|really enjoy playing this game. hints are available if you need the and you can pinch and pull screen bigger and smaller.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love how you can change the to how you want and that you can change all the setting on how your turning and everything This game is so fun and cool I love it that's why I give it a five
B000KJU1MS|5.0|My dad loves KISS. This collection is perfect for all KISS fans. I knew as soon as he started to sing along to the music that it was a perfect buy!
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|I rented this and was disappointed that the movie was not as good as the book. It seemed long and dragged out. I think they were hoping for a movie series and if so they need a different screenwriter to beef it up.
0345529057|5.0|These books will suck any reader in. It doesn't matter what genre of literature you enjoy. This series has everything and don't get me started on the TV SHOW. I can't get enough!
0307476073|2.0|While the vivid descriptions of scenery and living creatures along the PCT trail are most welcome, I could have done without counting and recounting the subjects store of condoms and sexual encounters.  Toward the end of the book the subject  did seem to come to terms with some of her issues with family members, and did complete the trail by herself...bravo!  We all have had out &#34;trails&#34; to walk alone without whining to the world about it.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Listen to this album, I mean actually feel the mood of the music and understand the lyrics. If you do this and are still disappointed, get a check up at the doctors to make sure you're O.K.<br />TL;DR: Buy this now. NOW. now
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Don't know why I never watched this show much way back when. I am catching up now. Slowly. Seems a little dated now, of course. I like cop shows, so this is an excellent one.
0920668364|5.0|This is a book the was read to my second grade class many many years ago. When my niece was born I bought th book for her. The day I found out iwas expecting I bought the book. I also give this book for a shower present to everyone now. It is a beautiful story about how enduring a mother's love is and how that love crosses generations.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|First let me begin by saying that I rented this movie from a local video store (But I do plan on buying it off Amazon in the near future), which is why there is no confirmed purchase for my review.  Now moving along-<br /><br /> Setting: It seems that a lot of reviewers are immediately jumping on the point that the movie has one setting, a small and dark coffin.  For some reason people are saying that this detracts from the experience or that it was cheap of the producers and directors to do such a thing.  I completely disagree.  The fact that this movie has one setting only intensifies the experience that you get from seeing a scared man trapped underground.  It increases your ability to emphasize by showing you no other settings, in a sense, trapping you along with him.  Some movie-makers are not capable of pulling such a stunt, but Director Rodrigo Cortés has proved that he is able to do such a feat.  This film does more with one small setting, than thousands of other films have done that have dozens of settings.<br /><br /> Camera and Lighting: As far as the camera angles go, I thought that they were rather impressive at conveying the cramped quarters that Paul is stuck in, without being obnoxious or tough to look at.  The lighting effects are also superbly implemented, and the film is pitch black when it needs to be, and has accurate lighting details from either Paul's zippo, glowstick, or flashlight throughout the movie.<br /><br /> Story: I felt like I was on the edge of my seat the entire time the movie was rolling, as Ryan Reynolds pushes the plot along with his perfect rendition of desperation, terror, and frustration.  Throughout the movie he uses his only tool of outside help, the cellphone his kidnappers left him, to try and contact somebody on the outside who could help him.  This really makes you think about who you would call if you were in a situation like this, as most people are not able to do anything for him, as he is in Iraq.  People even havethe nerve to put him on hold or ask him stupid questions when he is pleading for them to save his life.  He eventually gets through to Dan Brenner (voiced by Robert Paterson, who does an excellent job), who handles hostage situations in Iraq.  Throughout the film, you have to wonder how much Dan really cares about Paul, especially when it concerns politics (Dan and others frequently tell him not to call any news outlets as it would cause an international incident).  The end of the movie is the most satisfying aspect, and I think the ending was carried out marvelously.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film highly enough.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|fast and fun read. This is the perfect book to take to the beach and read it in a day.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|It was good but i am looking for it with Ramin Karimloo amd Sierra Boggias . I do believe they do have a dvd out there somewhere.
B00479SVBU|1.0|The first 2 weeks were great.  After that there was an intermittent reboot every few minutes.  A few months later it was brain dead.<br /><br />I realize there's no perfect MP3 solution for the car, so I sucked it up and just bought a new system with its own USB port.  That did the trick.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a great book and a great movie.  Lots of action, characters you could relate too and a good ending, considering.  Look forward to next sequel.  It on my list.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|The graphics and scenery are beautiful, it's fun to just run around and check out all the sites.The game has a unique story  line , just use your  imagination. The controls are tricky at first but easy to get used to, once you get started its hard  to put it down. If you like WOW (World of Warcraft) you'll love this game.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really good, I sorta figured out the ending but not all. Wants me to read his other books as soon as I can.
B006MGDVIY|4.0|A well balanced review of the life of one of the greatest racers ever. Explained a lot of the mystery of the man.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|This is a fantastic album. There is not a song on this album that I don't thoroughly enjoy listening to. I am delighted she rreleased this album. She has certainly reinvented her fame and success over the past few years. This album is one you will definitely want in your collection.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|One of my favorite actors, Ben Kingsley does an amazing job of portraying one of the most influential people in history.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the game I'm on my kindle fire alot  can't wait to play find myself sneaking to play when ever i can.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|Definitely worth the price of admission. Good solid post-Layne album (RIP).  Agreed that the \\"Layne was better\\" crybabies need to move on.  Not as much variety as Black Gives Way to Blue so the songs start to run together.  Can't find many good new heavy bands so it's good to see tried and true bands are still out there putting out good work.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|after the first few months, it was fine and every thing was alright. then I accidentally uninstalled it. I re-installed it and logged in but it would force close and say something about a freaking error every time I tried to open it. fix it soon please.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|The ability to make the sounds the way you want is good, even makes a fun toy, but I wonder about battery life life on my Kindle and all that.I would be more likely to use it to nap than meditate. Guess I'll have to try and see, or just plug in and relax.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story - could hardly put the book down. I cannot wait to start the next book and see what happens next.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|This is one if those \\"destined-to-be-a-classic\\" movies. A great cast, well-written storyline and fantastic animation all come together to make a great American family film. My young children love it, and my wife and I enjoy it, too. It transcends age and isn't cloying like so much of the junk being cranked out as \\"animated family movies\\" these days.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't have been more entertained reading these books. Thank you Amazon for making this a book highlighted in the splash pages of my Fire.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|Movie is great and I am sure others will write detailed reviews....however, I would rather get my teeth drilled than deal with a Disney digital movie redemption.  After 45 minutes I finally got the digital movie, but I still have a charge on my account because Disney did NOT provide the correct page link.  And, you cannot call them except during their business hours which is totally incompatible with most people's digital redemption hours.  I will be very hesitant to do this with Disney ever again.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I don't know why, but I am into this show. Excellent characters and excellent acting. I love the subtle mixed with the blatant.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I like Tommy Lee Jones. OK plot, ok acting.<br /><br />Watched on prime, on laptop good video and audio.<br /><br />Prime is really good deal!
B006QNDDHW|3.0|Some interesting content and covers a range of material to do with presentation messaging and clarity, especially the visual elements like icons, design, colors, etc. The format is not designed for kindle so a little harder to read than a made for e-reader format, which is somewhat ironic for a book on good presentation.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen DeGeneres.  She's funny, smart, well-spoken and open.  This book was a reflection of all of those attributes, but I didn't feel as though there was a real message in the stories she told.
0064430227|5.0|My granddaughters loves this book!  This is a great book for any child - encourages adventure and creating your own path.
B00597A6NU|5.0|Thought it really brought the feel of bomber combat home. A nice ensemble piece. There also exists a documentary version on which the film is based.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|what do you do when you've run out of ideas for your film franchise, and your aging star is mailing in his performance?  blow stuff up.  want to see stuff blow up?  watch this turkey.  want to watch a film in which characters seem even remotely involved with each other and speak lines that don't make you wince?  avoid A Good Way to Die Hard (A Bad Way to Die Off).  the previous films in this series have run the gamut from really good to pretty good.  this one is awful.  but, they blow stuff up really well!
B004KPHQR6|2.0|The original movie starring Martin Sheen was pretty good with an interesting premise. This version changed the plot a to a single man's quest. Not involving for me.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Awesome show!!!! Old England with the best drama and scandal. The relationship between the characters is addictive! Amazon, we need Season 3 on Prime!!!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|it is just a really good movie. the cg in it really makes you think it is a real world. also the creatures are similar and not so similar at the same time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't read these books fast enough and yet wish I wasn't on the last page when I get there! Awesome.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Not usually a Tommy Lee Jones fan but he did a great job in this movie. I found it to be a good flick. Well worth the watch.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have both previous Quells and love this puzzle style. I initially thought $2 was a little steep but im glad I bought it! I first thought the first few levels were too easy like the original, but later found out that I was supposed to find a gem on each level too, so I went back. Then I discovered secret levels, oh man!  And then hidden time pieces on the hidden levels, oh goody!  It engages you only like Quell can and they added enough to keep it fresh...  pick this one up!
B000HF2NTE|4.0|Sylvester Stallone what else needs to be said !! Loads of good action and car chases. Love his 50 merc
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I loved gaining understanding about how different people operate in the world. I felt validated as an introvert, and learned how to value my own style. I would recommend this book to anyone who is and introvert, works with one, or is raising one.
B005I4JG80|4.0|The ideas in this book are really simple. If you've never heard any other parenting advice than this stuff is common sense. However, you probably have heard some patenting advice, and that advice probably contradicts some of the things in this book. I wish I had read this before my baby was 4 months old so I could have tried out the theories on babies sleeping through the night. Unfortunately, I missed my window of opportunity. The ideas are presented in an entertaining story about this mom's parenting life in Paris.  It's a very easy read and you may get some good ideas from it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game has nice graphics and sound. Much more fun and challenging than your ordinary Match 3 game! I would recommend Jewel Legends: Tree of Life to everyone at any age!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this book and the 2 before in this series. However I did not realize this was not the last book. Wish I knew when the rest was coming out. Will be reading this series again and again.
B009C7JS14|3.0|It seems to tke forever to come up.  I don't like that I only see 12 hours each time. But it's OK.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Me and my grandchildren love this game. But they wish you could do more with the fish.but they love the matching game.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book had a GREAT start. It was very engaging from the first chapter. It got a bit confused toward the end but I still kept reading.
B005LAIHCM|3.0|I love Jennifer Lawrence but she really shouldnt have done this movie. i mean its not horrible and she was really good in it but the script was blah. It took a while to get to the point. But I applaud the twist at the end.
B0092MJ6B6|5.0|Every song on this album is amazing.  I could have been listening to this for years, yet I just discovered it.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I love this movie. The script is well written and the actors had good chemistry. Most movies like this are low budget and the special effects are disastrous but this one had really good special effects.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I have tried playing this game many times but have been disappointed each time because it is sooooo boring.  Even the five year old that I got the game for doesn't Like it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is excellent. I use it all the time. I look forward to seeing any updates they come up with.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland is short & sweet yet still poignant. A perfect summer read. And a book I know I will revisit.<br /><br />Dev Jones goes to work at an amusement park called Joyland in the summer of '73 on his break from university. With King it is a coming of age story with a dash of the supernatural that still seems completely plausible.  A perfect combination.<br /><br />I can't say why I connect with the books & characters. I'm too young to have been a child or young adult in the times King writes about. I'm not an American. But somehow King manages to write books that give me a sense of nostalgia I can't explain. When he writes of coming of age (The Body, It & now Joyland) I am taken away & it feels like I'm back in the summers of my youth. In a place where your whole life is ahead of you & all your decisions have yet to be made. They are a complete pleasure to read.<br /><br />Read Joyland, you won't be disappointed.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I got hooked after the first episode and it just got better as the season went on. Can't wait for the next season
B0061PEAUY|5.0|If you can get over all of the &#34;french&#34; in the book (which isn't very much) this is an amazing read! I was hesitant to order this book as I really like the &#34;bones&#34; series on TV. These are similar but have a life of their own. I bought another one of her books tonight!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Loved season 7 of Voyager!! Full of action and a great ending for the series. A must watch for any star trek fan.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I don't want to spoil the story but want to recommend! I heard the acting was excellent and I agree especially the unknown kids who star! The CGI takes your breath away its so realistic and well done so you feel like you are experiencing how it would be to be caught in a giant sunami. Heart wrenching of course wach with a huge bowl of popcorn and a box of tissues...<br />A MUST see!
B00633W614|5.0|One the bestage-turners in years.  I only hope it hasn't come to an end. Makes me want to read everything by Archer (if I haven't already)
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Love everything he made after the Conan's those are awful!! Terminator series fizzled after &#34;3&#34; and I was sad :*(<br />Huge fan of Running Man and probably consider Total Recall a fave of all time. True lies even Kindergarten Cop and Twins all funny stupid! Sooo I was laughing my way through The Last Stand but still found the old machismo I love BACK!<br />Boy does Arnie look aged but he plays it off in Gran Torino Eastwood style. Bad a$$ guns and gore galore old school style. I wanted to punch Knoxville but he has his role and appreciate the &#34;guy becomes hero and gets his gal&#34; BS Arnie is known for. Corney--check, B movie joy--check, Arnold as a small town sheriff with a past--check!<br />The governator redeems himself here, entertained ;)
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Seeing a whole new side of many of the characters. Like the new slant. Looking forward to next season already!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is fantastic. Great actors, directors, sets, EVERYTHING. Can't wait for season 4! Would not recommend this show for kids younger than 11.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Its a good fun movie, cheesy gore and a few laughs, a little intrigue. A new look to an old fairytale.  Not a bad casual rental but I wouldn't stake my night on it by any means.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I really enjoyed Ellen's sense of humor!!  It made me laugh even on a bad day!!  I highly recommend this book!
B0064NTZKI|4.0|...that I have not already come across in the numerous Allen biographies and interviews that I've read over the years.  Nevertheless, here are some of my biggest take-aways:<br /><br />-This is the first time I've seen Allen's sister, Letty, interviewed at length. It's kind of hard to believe they have common parents. There is absolutely nothing eccentric about her.<br /><br />-Over the years I have heard many people complain about how bland Allen is, a conclusion they reached after watching various interviews with Allen (especially the ones conducted for the documentary \\"Wild Man Blues\\"). I used to have the same impression.  Until this documentary came along.  I finally realized that there is really nothing particularly bland about him.  He just isn't what you expect.  You expect him to be like his characters in the movies (highly animated and neurotic); and compared to them, he is relatively bland. But if you forget about the comparisons, Allen comes across as relatively normal. Not bland, just normal.<br /><br />-The Soon-Yi so-called scandal continues to this day to totally and completely mystify me.  To this day, no one has been able to explain to me what Allen did wrong. I've discussed this with dozens of people over the past 20 years, and most people can't even get the basic facts right.  They think that Soon-Yi was Allen's adopted daughter (she wasn't), or that Allen lived at Mia's with Soon-Yi and the other kids (he never spent one overnight), or that Mia and Allen were still as involved with each other as they ever were (they weren't), or that Soon-Yi was a minor when her relationship with Allen began (she was already in her 20's), or that Soon-Yi was mildly retarded (she went on to receive her Masters Degree from Columbia University, for Pete's sake) and on and on with the factual inaccuracies.  And whenever I correct the people that don't have the facts right, it never seems to make a difference.  Evidently, they never could stand the agnostic little weirdo from the very beginning, and this was their big chance to bash him. But at any rate, in my lifetime, I have never witnessed a celebrity receive such an incredible bashing for...what is it that he did wrong?  I still don't know to this day.  I do know this much, though: In order to apparently get even with Allen, Mia deliberately made up lies about Allen molesting their adopted daughter, Dylan, and had the unmitigated gall to go to the police with that pack of lies.  After a thorough investigation, Allen was exonerated. And what happened to Mia after that? I thought that people that falsely accuse others of child molesting were supposed to go to jail. She got off without even a wrist slap, and Allen ended up picking up her attorneys fees for the entire mess across the board for the sum of several million dollars. And then later on Mia wrote an autobiography trashing Allen. Talk about getting away with murder.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />But at any rate, for those that haven't read many of the Allen bios and interviews, this documentary is a great place to start and a terrific overview of his life and career. For me, the only new stuff in this documentary was the clips from his television appearances early on in his career (50's, 60's, early 70's), which I enjoyed tremendously. (Those that are unaware of Allen's pre-filmmaking career as a stand up comedian are in for a real treat.)<br /><br />Very good piece of work. Highly recommended.
B004FECNIO|5.0|I think this is one of Spielberg's best works....infrequently talked about, rarely remember, and what a shame.  This is a really good reproduction of a great film.
159463176X|2.0|I really looked forward to another book by Hosseini and with every chapter kept thinking it was going to improve.  Instead, it was one of the most chopped-up books I've read in a long time.  Perhaps he should have stuck with two or three characters.  I won't waste any more $$$ on another one of his books.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|This amazing French film is/will be a true cinematic classic.  Highly original, amazing story/script, brilliantly designed in all aspects of it's production, this is a must for film lovers....and the blu-ray disc is superb.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have a similar app on my iPhone and find it very convenient, so it made sense to have it on my Kindle too.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|...from a great movie.  Well done depiction and choice of music from this really great movie with an amazingly talented cast.
0979019710|5.0|A fantastic boo with life changing thoughts and principles, am enjoying it so much!! 3rd consecutive day of the mm and planning to continue for the rest of my life
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I love to learn about history!!! The costumes and scenes are magnificent! Now I am looking for a great book about Henry VIII, all because of this movie. They must have love a lot of sex in the day. I just which it wasn't so vivid, for I would have recommended it for High School students who have interest in deep history. I still give it five star for politics, costumes, settings and conspiracy.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I luv this game its really fun and detective like and its like ur in real scary movie like at the beginning of the game like a real movie
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After waiting SO MANY MONTHS for what I thought was the last book in this series VERY disappointed that we now have to wait AGAIN for who knows how long for the next book (or books)! And this book was way too short to be considered a true novel!  Can't believe the cost was the same as the others in the series. I feel like Sylvia Day's readers have been ripped off and a great story ruined because of greed! So disappointed!!!
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|I got the game and I thought it would be very fun but the game deletes my progress in the campaign every like 20 minutes,and the multiplayer mode doesn't even work it just says no connection even when it great but the campaign is very fun. PLZ GET AN UPDATE FOR THE MULTIPLAYER PART.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|I got this for my Samsung Galaxy III to slosh my photos and personal audio files around between devices. I wasted hours trying to make it useful from my desktop PC and phone via Amazon's site. No like'um.

1490313370|5.0|Thank you James Altucher for your writing brilliance which lightens up my world. Very few people can make me laugh out loud when I read their words. But you do this, not once, not twice, but repeatedly. I find you refreshingly real and transparent. And you just have the greatest stories. And an engaging way to share those stories that compel me to keep reading-this is your gift as a truly great writer. Please don't ever stop writing because your blog and your books are like good medicine delivering the most healing potion in the world, which is laughter.

B00BY8DNK6|2.0|Who could do such a terrible job of remastering? I'm a huge Dio fan, so I was pretty happy when I learned this concert was being released. I didn't think all those negative reviews could be right, they were right. This could of been one of Dio's best live albums. It has a great track list, excellent vocals. I was pretty displeased with this CD, that's why I bought the Japan imported remastered. There is a noticeable difference with all the instruments and the vocals. A much better job on the mastering.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|The games was great it was one of the best games I have ever played on my kindle<br />I think they should make another one

193700788X|5.0|This book was purchased as a gift for my daughter.  She enjoyed the Harry Potter books and a friend loaned her one of these books.  Now she is reading this series.  She also enjoys the True Blood TV series.
0385342055|4.0|Here is my take on this most recent Shopaholic book-every one of us has small vices-giving in to our kids, spoiling them, buying something really expensive that we really want but don't really need, little white lies we give to our parents, etc, etc, etc. In most cases, it's either one of the small vices that we always have, or, a few of the occasions when we are \\"bad\\".  But, imagine having all of these vices all the time and you got Becky Bloomwood.  That's why I find the book so hilarious because she gets herself into these situations. She obviously has a kind heart and means well, but it's true that it's time for her to grow up, stop being so selfish and start being an example to her daughter, however, then the book would not be so much fun. So take it for it is-a really light and fun read that personally I, a busy mother of 3 kids with a very serious job and an occasional headache that makes me put away my favorite New Yorker magazine happen to enjoy on my daily 3 hour roundtrip commute.

1781162646|5.0|I have read Stephen King since I was 13 and I checked Carrie out of the library.  My mother had never heard of Stephen King, and \\"horror\\" fiction was not her thing so I had to seek it out on my own.  I can't say I have read every single word King has written...started the Dark Tower series and finished the first book a few months ago, but have not been inspired to pick up the second one for one very simple reason - I am working a new job and simply don't have time to \\"invest\\" in a series that I am pretty sure will grab a hold of me and won't let me go until I have read the entire saga.  I will get to it at some point.  In any event my favorite King books are not the paranormal laden stories, but the more reality based novels. Among my favorites: \\"The Body\\", \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\", \\"The Green Mile\\" (okay paranormal is a pretty big part of this one!) I was looking at Amazon.com for something totally unrelated to reading material when I saw this on the \\"Recommended\\" section.  I read the brief synopsis and while it didn't exactly grab me as a \\"must read\\" I needed something to fill out the order to get the free super-saver shipping.  This fit the bill.  Boy, am I glad I bought it.  This is now one of my top 5 favorite King novels.  I opened the book on Monday night, and finished it Wednesday night.  If I didn't have to work 12 hours each day, I probably would have stayed up all night to finish it as it grabbed me right away.  It was a quick and easy read, but was deeply satisfying. Devin Jones is immensely likable and who can't relate to the heartbreak that Dev goes through?  Nearly all of the characters are interesting and well drawn. There is the requisite paranormal and psychic phenomenon that is almost always present in some way in King's fiction, but it does not dominate the story as some of his other works.  There is no \\"in your face\\" graphic descriptions of violence and terror. The psychic elements and ghosts ARE crucial elements of the story, make no mistake.  But, the point of the story is not the paranormal, it is Dev's journey during an emotionally complex time in his life that is center stage.  The relationships are expertly developed, and the end reveals were as surprising to me as they were to Dev.  This was a thoroughly enjoyable read from start to finish.  Well worth my time.
0679446230|5.0|Chinua gave us a history that, for a change, was not from a European, I must conquer, point of view. A well told story of the demise of a way of life with the entrance of the arrogance of another culture.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was bought for me a while ago, but I put off reading it. Not because I was worried it wouldn't be good, but I read Hopeless and it took me a while to recover from it. After a lot of heckling, I finally gave in and read it.<br /><br />It was definitely worth the read. I loved the flow of the book, and the characters - especially Eddie. I liked the speed of how things moved, where it allowed me to feel things with the characters. I liked how it made me cry, both happy and sad tears.<br /><br />This book is as awesome as people say it is, and worth the hype that circles around it. It was written by an incredibly talented author and I can't wait to read more of her stories.<br /><br />5/5 platypires!
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|its totally worth the money! I love the different scenes and I like the Easter bunny update with costumes that doesn't cost real money. way better than the free version.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This film is magnificent.  In spite of being a children's story  this version of MERLIN is excellent!!!! .

Children can lern a lot with this film.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This is the third book in the series. It forced on Eva and Gideon' rebuilding their relationship in hiding. There were events in the story that got your attention. There was one part that I got tears in my eyes. Eva has gotten stronger in this book emotionally and physically . There still are females in Gideon's life that will start trouble. You jus need to read the book to get your own opinion.

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|all the songs are great and in the Rod Stewart style.  Better than expected but each song is amazing.

You won't be sorry if you purchase this CD.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I cannot believe this book was published. how nobody within the publishers or reviews pointed out how bad it is, is beyond me.

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I expected a lot from this book after reading A Thousand Splendid Suns and Kite Runner. While I still enjoyed the story, I didn't think it was as good as the previous two.<br />The story was engaging and I liked that it crossed generations. However, I felt less of a connection with the characters...

B00CWV8X04|5.0|Compelling, entertaining and surprising. I chose it because of the cast, not the subject matter, and was surprised that it was so interesting and well paced. I did not guess the plot twists at every turn and that always makes me like a movie.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|entertaining but does get confusing. the alternate realities is very interesting but it is easy to get the alternate Olivia's confused
B001HC8516|5.0|after purchasing this book by mistake i decided it would be a good summer read. im glad i opened myself to read this book because it was empowering. i broke up with my boyfriend after realizing i deserved better. i was the girl who put in all the work and i wanted the feeing to be mutual. glad i stopped wasting my time on him because i met someone amazing who really is into me. this book isnt flawwed. its entertaining,funny,helpful, and gregs insight is something all of us women need. liz im glad this book wasnt just one sided because all of us women have the struggle in settling for less. im so glad i gave it a chance. thank you so much greg and liz you guys are relationship gods!

1591845556|5.0|As I'm sure is the same for you, there's a lot of stuff I want to do before I die.  Much of that requires learning new skills.<br /><br />I've studied a lot on this subject.  I've read books like Mastery, Talent is Overrated, The Dip, Outliers and others.  I've also read a lot online.  But this is the first book that systematically shows you how to quickly acquire a new skill and then, most importantly, shows you how the author applied his principles to skills ranging from programming to windsurfing to playing the ukulele.<br /><br />The first chapter gives you some background on the author -- who also wrote the fantastic business book [[ASIN:1591845572 The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business]].<br /><br />The next two chapters takes you through the principles behind quickly learning a new skill:<br />- 10 Principles of Rapid Skill Acquisition<br />- 10 Principles of Effective Learning<br /><br />After that, each chapter is an example of how the author applied the principles of rapid skill acquisition and effective learning to a variety of things including:<br />- Yoga<br />- Programming<br />- Touch typing<br />- Go (an ancient, highly strategic board game)<br />- Playing the Ukulele<br />- Windsurfing<br /><br />The variety of skills is what makes this book so helpful.  In my mind, the difference between learning something like Yoga vs Programming was vast.  But this book shows you how the basic principles are the same.<br /><br />If you're interested in learning something new (who isn't?), then I highly recommend this book.  Buy it now.
B00AK57N00|4.0|Fun to play.  For some reason, for a simple game, I really get sucked in to it.  I find myself groaning and aahhing and leaning and cheering.  Weird.  But I like it!
1936608898|5.0|My friend invited me to do the whole30 challenge and encouraged me to get the book....I am SUPER happy that I did! To be honest, the plan is harder mentally than physically. The concepts they provide in a book are good for people like me who like to see scientific backup. I LOVE the references in the back of the book. The food mapping plan makes it easy for me not to panic when I feel that I can't eat anything except junk food! my sugar cravings have gone away and I feel really good! This is not a fad diet and I really do think the 30 day plan is a great start, but it's good to continue the plan (hence the book.)<br /><br />Purchasing the book isn't required to do the whole30, but i encourage you to do so! You won't regret purchasing this book!

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have been reading some of the reviews on this book and am stunned by some of the more negative comments only because for the past two days, I have been telling people this book will go down as one of my top 5 favorite.  To each his own, I suppose.  For me, where The Kite Runner and 1,000 Splendid Suns were 5 star books, this one is my favorite out of the three and earns a 5+++++++++.<br />Each one of the characters was so well developed and I love the way Hosseini tells the story from the perspectives of so many different people.  I could easily read this book again, and I haven't reread a book in probably 20 plus years!<br />Thank you, Hosseini, for sharing your incredible gift with us!
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I can only open if I downloaded from Google play. I paid for this app on amazon and it won't open.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Great story, but to drag it out to a book 4 & 5 is simply not right and many of the fans feel played and ripped off.  This book was full of \\"fluff\\" at parts, and I fear the content for 4 & 5 will be the same.  Give the fans some closure instead of dragging the ending out!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This series has evolved greatly from the original Star Trek Enterprise. The cast portrays admirably the evolution of species in our universe, and the new, technical, details and information in an advanced age and new world merits a five stars!

B000067CQK|5.0|It is the best seller. I recommend it to the whole world, for his rapidity in sending the product. It is the best in the envalaje of the product. It is the best in the communication since it answers rapidly and solves any doubt that you could have. It is the best as which it has a lot of variety of CD and if it does not have it does everything possible to be able to obtain it o information. It is the best as which with the envalaje it has of gift some postcard. It is the best in the small detail.<br />The seller is from japon and they have for culture try to take pleasure to the maximum to the client, do not seek only for the benefit but to take pleasure to the client it is his maxim aspiration

0802473156|5.0|I first read this book around 15 years ago. Needed a refresher and bought another copy. This book is not about fixing your spouse. It's about learning how to communicate love in a way(s) (language/languages) that your spouse understands, and also understand your own way(language) for feeling loved . With an open mind and willingness to learn this book can save couples several marriage counseling sessions! :-)

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush is back, with yet another incredible feat of audio beauty.  Continuing with their trend since Vapor Trails, Rush continues to blast out hard, modern rock, while still staying Rush through and through.  Rush fans will remember the days of their numerous concept albums, and will be glad to know that they've done it again.  While less fluid than marvels like 2112 and Cygnus X-1, there is still an overarching theme and story that binds the album together.  Outstanding tracks include BU2B and Headlong Flight, among the rest of the album, because seriously, it's Rush.  Get it.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I almost bypassed this movie until I read that it was directed by Sam Raimi. I am a big fan of Raimi's work and this time he has created a cinamatic masterpiece. I cannot believe I have never heard of this movie before today. I rented and watched on a projector at 720p.<br /><br />The black and white intro: For those viewing on a small screen, I can imagine your frustration. I agree with the other posters and do your best to get past the intro, the rest of the movie is well worth it. I don't mean to suggest the intro is not worth watching, I was just addressing the people with small screens. The black and white is detail rich, and equally balances with tone, texture and visual appeal. The stark contrast from black and white to color gives even more emphasis to the color once it begins.<br /><br />The actors: The cast is well chosen. James Franco, the Oz, is suppose to an annoying con-man with little redeeming quality and I found Franco fits this role perfectly. Rachel Weisz, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis were great as the three witches, with Mila Kunis giving a great preformance. Honestly, I didn't think she had it in her.<br /><br />The storyline: The story is about how the Great Oz became the Great Oz and how the Wicked Witch Of The West became wicked. The background of all three witches are presented in a basic way. Done as a prequel, the story blends both old and new well.<br /><br />Cinematography: This is where the movie shines, or more appropriately, glows. When the black and white part ends and the color starts, each scene is like a work of art. I felt like a little kid watching the screen. All that color. I think Raimi's intent was to mirror what those viewers of the first techicolor movie must have experienced. This movie is meant for high definition and the big screen but even at 720p, my viewing experience was amazing. I wish I could view it in a theater.<br /><br />There is no bad language, no nekkid people, a couple of fight scenes (actors land very hard after being hit by magic) and a few scary, flying monkies. There is a big tornado scene. The Wicked Witch does threaten to eliminate all the good people. However, the good vs evil is well balanced with good triumphing in the end.<br /><br />If you are one of those people that could care less about nostalgia and just want to see a high action movie with a lot of special graphics, this movie is not for you. This movie is meant to reflect the original, almost a period piece with some enhanced graphics. I feel many teenagers and some of the 20-30/something crowd will not appreciate it. However, for me, I feel Raimi hit a home run with this gem.hard after being hit by magic) and a few scary, flying monkies. There is a big tornado scene.

B00AWJYJVA|5.0|If you thought John le Carre, now into his 80s, was past his best work, this book is a must-read.<br />It's a cracking story with some great characters.<br />Le Carre breaks some rules with tenses and point of view but somehow it doesn't grate; it works.<br />I have read a couple of reviews that absolutely pan this book so methinks if you are a member of the Tea Party and accept certain shadowy remedies as necessary evils, the truths in this book might be just a tad too delicate for you.<br />For the realists among us, go for it.

B000053VAZ|5.0|Very happy with my purchase.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is fun get this app it better than world craft hey if you want the full version go ahead<br />:)
0812982622|3.0|I found Johnson's method of making the account of events more like the way human memory works very hard to follow, confusing and frustrating.  Instead of chronological sequence, he mixes the order of when things occurred.  At least as far as I could tell, that's what he did.  That's the main reason I give it only an OK.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|\\"If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.\\"<br /><br />Yummy. I love Gideon. I know some readers have their panties in a twist at the addition of two books to the series, but I say BRING IT ON! I will gladly take two more scoops of Dark & Dangerous. Ace & Angel still have a ton going on around them and they need to work on their broken pasts that keep haunting them. Gideon is still dripping with sex appeal bordering on the brink of perfection.<br /><br />\\"Day one of my life was the day I met you.\\" Oh my Mr. X, I am still insanely smitten with you.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Does what you need it to. And it's easy for enough to use. I just needed a alarm clock for sporadic use and this is perfect.
0786958731|5.0|I have never played Dungeons and Dragons before and this game was a great help. It is a nice in between. I have a hard time with the role playing stuff, but I like adventure type board games. This was really fun!
B00APUTEBG|3.0|Good, but a romantic element would have added a lot! I think Bruce Willis should not have been killed, at least not so early.
B00000JMOJ|2.0|I thought this movie was great when I saw it as a teenager, now it seems dated and cheesy. But it's worth watching at least once if you haven't seen it before.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|how cool is this record guys!<br />I've been waiting to hear this for many years.<br />thanks for the distribution and continued success.
B000U6BT40|4.0|How did I miss this on tv?  It's a great series with terrific characters you get to know and love.  They take you through a multitude of mishaps, and yes, always come out on top, but somehow it's always fun!  Their predicaments are unique with a twist on the storyline.  Fun stuff for sure.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|This was one of the most exciting performances of an opera I have seen.. Rolando Villazon was exceptional. I highly recommend this performance. It would be a good introductory opera for anyone since it is upbeat and comical.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Have enjoyed playing this game.  Great mix of easy and hard ones. I have even gotten friends and family into by making them help me on the ones I get stuck on. Only downside is it can be addictive.
0307730697|1.0|While I am sure others may find this a great read, I did not. I could not get into it and I usually enjoy biographies. I commend the navy, army, air force, SEAL's, police, firemen, and anyone else putting their lives in danger so others can be safe, I found this book hard to connect with and soon into it I could go no further. I found it hard to read because at first, Adam Brown could do no wrong. He was the best. FEARLESS is what everyone says he was and I felt the author of this book was exaggerating on things...he may not have been but because of this I could not get into it.<br /><br />For other great reviews by me visit [...]
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very well done. Im a little late coming to the party, but I now understand what all the hype is about.  This is a fantastic series.  I haven't seen anything like it. The story is so well done and the acing is excellent.  Don't miss this.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|It works for GameCube and Wii and its white but the box is in Japanese because it came from Japan.
B004GYY714|5.0|i am big time appricate who ever make this app.and now it on my kindle . i enjoy my favorite music through this App.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Well I love the game it's fun to see myself try so hard to beat something and to like it so much I'm going to get the full version too
B004UID2LC|1.0|Do not get this app it stinks!<br /> what a rip off I have I heart radio and it is way better this has none of my favorite songs. so do not get this app under any cercomestaces even if your life depends on it do not get it its a rip off really!
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|This was an interesting and informative book but I felt that a lot of the information was repeated. The diet and concept itself is fairly straight forward but most of the information can be seen on the web site. A little expensive for what it is.
B0009X75UG|4.0|I have been listening to Andreas vollenweider since his first tour to Cleveland, OH.  I had these tapes, but needed the CD's.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|When are people going to realize that John McClain is Chuck Norris in disguise? Stop dissing the man. He gets it right in the end.
B0009VBTA0|5.0|I have the tape and wanted the CD.  It's easy listening and I really love it.  Looking forward to any new CD's he is producing.  What a talent!
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|I really don't remember it. That is not a good sign. I have no idea what happened and I didn't care to know.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Her dancing in the videos while playing the violin to hip hop beats if fun to watch...the first couple times, and it takes a lot of skill, but the real treat is simply listening to her play. And I do almost every day. I look forward to her next album.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Reminded me of the original Romero versions that had an opinion and not just dead people. Good story, good acting. Not a lot of gore if you are into that, (and I am).
1439153663|2.0|What I would love to know is what black people think about this book. I know some blacks were put off because The Help was written by a white woman. I don't agree that race should limit ones creative product.<br />But his book is a very intimate portrayal of the black experience and I felt that the author believed merely having the slaves speak bad grammar made them black.  I found this book flat without nuance., irony or historical information. Is it historical fiction? The characters were one dimentional where<br /> everyone was either good _ the slaves or bad - the owners bad.  I did want to know what happened to all the characters thus he two stars.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is a great show. The cast has done an amazing job with their characters. I can't wait for season five!
1250012570|5.0|Remember the 80s and early 90s and the mixed-tape? That was my tween and teen years - the mixed tape! Eleanor & Park is like one big mixed-tape of awesome.<br /><br />Eleanor is the new girl at school with a colourful history. She has bright red curly hair, dresses in baggy clothes and doesn't fit in. Park is not quite popular, not quite unpopular, who loves comics and music. Forced to sit next to Park one day on the school bus Eleanor and Park development a friendship (and later a romantic relationship) over comics and music.<br /><br />I wanted a sweet book to read next, and I've heard so many good things about Eleanor & Park and well... look at the cover, it looks like this book is fantastic! AND it was! It was a sweet romantic Young Adult fiction about two different kids, one from a normal, happy family, and one from a abusive family with a alcoholic step-dad. Together they create a beautiful friendship that feels timeless.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book - the comics, the music and the feel of the 80s. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to fans of YA fiction, and I definitely plan to pick up Rainbow Rowell's next release.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I was disappointed with this trilogy - soon to be a quadrilogy by the look of it. Jeffery Archer can spin a great tale and this series began that way. However we all know he has some financial woes and splitting one story into 3 or 4 books is purely a revenue raising tactic on his part. Think back to Kane & Abel - a great story in one volume. I found this trilogy becoming less and less credible as it progressed and as I result I am uncertain about future Archer books.
B000005RUV|5.0|No music collection is complete without Wham!  I have added it to my MP3 player as well.  I am very happy with it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|would recommend to others, I enjoyed it this book.  However, it is not the best book I have ever read, not even close.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have loved Mahjong since I was in my 20s and now in my 40s, I appreciate it more.  Total concentration.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This was a good book. This keep me on the edge of my seat with th  lives of Eva and Gideon. I can't wait till the next boom so I can see where the adventure take me.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|You start and the next thing you know, several hours have gone by and you haven't eaten anything. And you need to use the bathroom.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|No alternative to using this composite video cable for the IPAD and IPOD, but it does work well.  It's not HD, but for a small flat screen, it's acceptable video.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|John Grisham takes us down the familiar path from the point of view of young teens.  His take this time deals out a story that still takes place on a regular basis, however, this time the system did not anticipate the kid attorney and his gang of friends.  Nice ending.
B0016OOS16|5.0|I cant imagine work in Autodesk Inventor without it..! It can reduce the drawing time in almost 30%. I recomment this product 100%
B003XDVUEG|3.0|The overall fit of the shoe is nice, but the top strap is tight, tight, tight!  I have the previous version of the shoe and it fits nicely, but this one is much more narrow.  I have a wide foot and would not recommend this shoe for people with wide feet.  The rest of the shoe is comfortable.  I'm thinking about cutting the top strap off!
B005DL9O5S|5.0|Tchaikovsky's music was always powerful and intense.  It provoked excitement.  It was what made him different from Mozart who made you feel relaxed or Beethoven which who like Tchaikovsky was powerful and intense but his contained an angry tone to it.  This box set is not complete but I would say covers most all of his important and significant compositions he had written.  I do recommend it for anyone who likes classical or romantic period composers.
B00821OX98|4.0|The series kept me glue to the tv, so much so that I had to watch the two seasons straight.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I don't know where I would be without this fantastic app, I have had no problem with it at all & I've had it for months, it tells you how much juice you have remaining for all relevant programs, get it.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this for a trip to Disney.  It held drinks, my camera, etc. It attached perfectly to my city micro and did not get in the way of folding it.
B00884GR0W|4.0|Good game because there are better graphics, fun old and new places and new items and hints at the loading. But the problem is that you can place beds and can't teleport to them and you can't even get to the beds that you placed before the automatic update. In my case the update kept my quest world which is good but didn't keep my creativity world. And the game glitches and deletes half of what I just did when I cut off the game. But besides that you should get the game, it's a really good game. Hope it can be fixed. :) And I hope you find it fun. Would rate it about 4 1/2 stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved reading this book. I am hooked and can not wait to finish the series. This is coming from someone who never reads. So that is saying slot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was worried because I watched the movie before I read the book and I was worried that I wouldn't like the book but I love it!!!! Suzanne Collins did a great job! I am looking forward to reading the next one!!!
B008ROG1QI|3.0|Enjoyable movie, but predictable...I enjoyed it though. I think part of it is that times were much different then, and society is so overloaded with violence that this seems very tame. It's a good thing.
B00D3V97DO|2.0|Man, was it just me or did it feel like someone was playing a 45 at 33? All the songs just felt soooooooo sloooowwwww... I mean, I get it. They were going for a heavier version of what they used to do but, and I hate to say this, they really missed the boat. There are some good elements but not enough to make purchasing the album worth it. I doubt I'll ever listen to it again. VERY disappointing!
B0091X2K0A|4.0|I just loved this movie...have seen it umpteen times and still watch it on occasion. I was about 13 when Vietnam started, so all of these Nam movies interest me.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this book, kept my attention, story lines were easy to follow.  Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was fascinated throughout the book and a little terrified of the truth. We always think we know our kids , that we as good  parents would be suspicious of abnormal sociopath behavior. Sadly, History has shown us this is not always the case.
1938469003|5.0|My son loved it and is using it today.  He tells me it is one of the better books he has used on brewing.
B000000HHE|5.0|Depressing themes dominate most hip-hop albums (especially now). The first time &#34;skits&#34; were used in hip-hop (unfortunately these interruptions ruin most hip-hop albums). The actually raps with ear-pleasing &#34;samples&#34; make up for this. The album cover says it all: neon colored cartoons mixed with complete and total dance-friendly nostalgia.
B007PFDJH4|4.0|Good characters, intriguing setting and time, lots of tangles and sub-plots. It did leave me feeling kind of lost and empty.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked this book because it was awesome  I loved it<br />I picked this book because it keeps me busy for a couple of days then after I'm done reading the book I do other stuff .<br />Well you  you saw how much I loved the book I hope you  don't like it I hope you LOVED the book then tell me about it.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|It was an alright movie. Too much blood and gore for my taste. My husband liked it but I would not watch again.
1416914285|5.0|I've been wanting to read these for a while but I always felt like there was a book I wanted to read first so I kept putting it off. With the movie just around the corner I felt I HAD to get this book before that. It was a great decision and I wished I had read it earlier. I can't wait to finish this series.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I'm listening to this album for the 2nd time today and will probably just hit the replay button when it's done again. These guys are so incredibly talented, it's unbelievable. And it's very easy to listen to while working. I'm off to go buy The Piano Guys 2 now....
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This was an excellent movie, showing the heroism of standing up against a corrupt government, the beauty of true love and honor between parents and children.<br /><br />Some scenes may be disturbing for younger viewers, so pre-screen and decide for yourself if you have children.<br /><br />I do not usually like musicals, but wow. This was fantastic. I highly recommend to all.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|My 4yr old and my 20mo old are having so much fun with this pool! I do recommend getting a special air pump for pools though. We carefully used an air compressor and it was hard to get the main part blown up and shut without to much air getting  back out again. Love how it also came with some pool toys that both boys love almost as much as the pool itself.
B008220D5K|5.0|NOT for children or adults who don't like a lot of bad language! The movie is super funny. A good watch for a husband and wife who struggle with children.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Darius and enjoy his newest CD very much!<br />We are true believers!
B00000IREA|5.0|It is somewhat difficult to describe Barbarella. It is bizarre, sexy, funny, and a definite 1960s sci-fi classic. It is not a movie for children (no way is this a PG- it was originally rated M for mature audiences). There is nudity and sexuality interlaced throughout the movie, and I must say that Jane Fonda was definitely in her prime when she starred in this (eye candy supreme). The bizarre scenes (including the metal-toothed biting dolls) could give kids (and adults) nightmares. There are some cute little blue bunnies hopping around though. The special effects are extremely funny, but that adds to the total feeling of the movie. In other words, do not view this film with a serious mind. The cast includes some very good actors (including Ugo Tognazzi, John Phillip Law, Marcel Marceau, David Hemmings, and Milo O'Shea) who must have had some fun making this movie. And, without a doubt, Jane Fonda was the perfect choice to play the lead role.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I am a big fan of the book and first film and I thought this might be a distraction accepting this format for a television series, however after watching the first few episodes I have come to love the new twist for this classic character Hannibal. Fishburn, Dancy and Mickelson are great and perfectly cast.
B00AK57N00|5.0|Its a fun game with very straight forward gameplay. Easy to pick up and play for a few minutes or hours.
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|The best Morse era album since Perpendicular. The star of the album is Don. I think in this album at least he is not trying to replicate the great 'Lord' of Hammond. Overall album is much much better than previous 3 albums. I am still not very impressed by Morse. I find his riffs and solos quite boring. Paicy sounds very tired in this album. What happened to his hard hitting drumming? Gillan's voice is still amazing and in someways its getting better with time. Over all good job but I think they should've change the name of the band because without Lord and Blackmore Deep Purple is not Deep Purple.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|Did the screenplay writer even read the book? I understand that certain liberties need to be taken when translating a book to the big screen but this was plain awful. The smallest details were missing and so much stuff was changed that the story didn't even make sense. The acting wasn't stellar either. I'm very dissapointed. I loved the book.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|The kids take candid pictures of themselves while playing games on the Kindle and I love getting to look at them later.  Very easy to use.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|The story line was a good concept, but too much yelling between characters, like they couldn't hear each other.  TOO MUCH FOUL LANGUAGE.  Seems its the only way to get the message across to the public.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Quality of Instant streaming was great. Convenient.<br /><br />She show itself was really good. Only the last couple episodes were kinda disappointing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I get very bored during the summer and this helped keep me entertained!! I would definitely recommend this game to my friends!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Excellent movie.  I loved it!  And you cant beat the price for it.  I love Amazons selection of movies.  They are worthwhile.
B001GCUER0|1.0|This is the second DVD I've ordered from Amazon/Media Wholesaler and the second one that was too 'dirty' for my player to read (though we have no problem with other DVDs).  Why would I ever try them again?  Plus, I paid extra to get the discs for my family and Amazon doesn't refund the shipping costs.  I don't know if someone's quality control is really this bad or if I'm getting used DVDs, but I won't be ordering from them again.  Recommend you find somewhere else as well -- someplace you can trust.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! It is a thriller yet you get so caught up in the characters you cant help but get engrossed in the twists and turns involved.in their struggles to survive. Totally addicting!
B000YABIQ6|2.0|Love the show, but these DVDs have problems.  The first disc wouldn't read at first -- &#34;too dirty&#34; -- and was smudged with fingerprints on the back.  It finally cleaned up enough to work.  Then we hit several spots on different DVDs from the set where it would freeze and you'd have to find a way to skip ahead.  Not fatal (or it'd only get one star), but certainly not the reliability I expect from a 'new' DVD.<br /><br />The kicker is, I just tried Season 2 DVDs from the same people, and they won't even play.  Don't waste your time and money.  Find somewhere else to buy your discs.
B000SEI618|1.0|He shows aged and aging as depressing and unloving with no hope, no reason to hope or work for a positive life.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|This album is still unique and enjoyable. I'm not usually a fan of anything synth-pop related, but I could listen to 90% of this album all day. Not a huge fan of the slower songs on the album, but they do have their merits.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Great characters with an ever evolving story line. I am hooked. Can't wait for season number two and three and four.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|Just a great overall album. Reggae-inspired tracks, mixed with rock and bluesy rock vibes. Love it. I couldn't recommend it more.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What can I say, we all need the weather channel. Comes in handy when you are travelling..<br />I will tell my friends..<br />Thanks,
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Great pack but the attachment straps started to tear off the third time I used it. I took it to have them reinforced and since have had no problems.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book. I think that if you have an amazing imagination you would love this book. I love how descriptive she was. I absolutely love the whole series.
1442358238|4.0|Keeping track of all the characters Ina's they are introduced is well worth it.  The way Clark intertwines their lives is amazing.  Excellent!  Thank you for a good read!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this is a great game but it used really hard to get diamonds until you get to level 8. You can do daily tasks to get diamonds. I know because I am at level 8 right now. Hope you like it. It is free.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|Actually, I meant the above review (Nemesis) for this title.  The story line is interesting, the writing rather dull.  Yes
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This is a very good dictionary. I read it from cover to cover. It is missing a few words, though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it,  this game teaches me alot because some things I never new,  and now I do an amazing game
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I found the book a bit hard to get into in the beginning but it got better as I read on.<br />To me it seemed a bit drawn out but okay read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I initially downloaded this book after reading the description about the first kiss to top all first kisses. But deep in the book, this story was just so tangled and layered. It was awesome, but like watching a train wreck in slow motion.<br /><br />My heart went out to Sky as she discovered why she was the way she was, and as she starts to piece together the puzzle pieces of her life. Several times I knew what was happening as the story unfolded, but to have it revealed...my jaw dropped many times. Great read!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|This is a prequel sequel all in one.  Interesting, but the point--moral--does not quite make the grade. Great makeup and performances.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I LOVED this series! I cannot wait until the next season, I will probably watch this over again. This is very well written.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game for anyone who likes three dimensional puzzles, or suspense games. The macabre elemental for a great atmosphere.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This movie was entertaining and I was able to watch the whole movie. Not a movie that I would say I would like to see it again. The film had a strange story to it and was definately different. I don't feel like I wasted my time watching it, but I feel it was missing the intensity that I like to see in movies.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini has written another spell-binding story of people about whom you come to care deeply.  His book also demonstrates how messy life can be!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so excited about Entwined with You- I had pre-ordered it months before it's release. I appreciate that her books pick up right where they left off and there's not a huge amount of back story to explain things to those readers who are jumping in for the first time in story 3 (I mean seriously who does that). Anyway- I was starting to get excited because Gideon was finally able to express himself, Eva wasn't being so dramatic, and they were acting as a \\"normal\\" couple. Then nothing. The whole book really didn't have anything you wanted to figure out or be revealed on the next page. It was clear that the author was leaving bread crumbs for readers to ensure they buy books 4 and 5, but none of the story line left was interesting! I could care less about that reporter, Cary's baby mama drama, and for crying out loud can we please stop with the Corinne chick? This book has made me so annoyed with the characters I can safely say- I'm walking away and recommending to all my friends to NOT read this book.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Joss Whedon doesn't disappoint with either concept (a Western, but in space) or content. In only 13 episodes, we meet a truly interesting cast of characters and get to learn so much about their lives and what brought them to the ship (as in space ship) &#34;Serenity.&#34; The brilliant dialogue and hilarious one-liners that one expects from a show helmed by Whedon are there and do not disappoint.<br /><br />Don't forget to also watch the feature film Serenity to see how the story ends for her crew.
1442474440|5.0|though my husband felt it was more for children, he loves to read all the old stories, and actually picked this one out, but felt it more for kids..
B00BHMETKC|5.0|this was better than i was expecting, well done Ben, John Goodman you have been busy. I missed you since Treme....
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|This is by far one of the stupidest sci-fi films I have ever seen!!!! It makes \\"Abbott and Costello go to Mars\\" look intelligent!! A good film starts with the story, and the story is weak, cliche ridden, and not well rounded!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|it just happens to be one, great movie Helen Hunt you do a great Mass accent. and please do more movies!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This show is fun to watch and the story lines are funny love the act-sent  on the girl fun fun
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book-it was so full of really interesting characters whose lives are all intertwined. Hosseini does both heartbreak and hope like no one else!
B000000XB9|5.0|This is a great collection of Creeedance Clearwater. I'm very happy with this purchase. I would most definately recommend it.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read.  It's light and fun as well as educational and thought provoking. I think it should be part of the social studies curriculum for high school students in every part of the world.
1452115567|5.0|Its a collection of nice pictures of a dog (Maddie) standing on unlikely things in unlikely places.  I saw a review where the commenter thought Maggie was unhappy but I don't think so. She just has a very stoic expression.<br />My dog would have done these thiings if I had asked him to; and he would have loved the interaction with me.<br />The book is fun. I'm happy with it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I really enjoyed the last book in this series and love who she ended up with! I'm sad they have come to an end:(
B0055IU4GM|5.0|I have most of Hiatts CD's. I love them all. This one is just another in the pile. Good stuff.<br />Buy it,.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love the game restaurant story because you get to cook the food and and it shows what type of food they like and rate it.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I only review movie 3-D so it's about focus , CGI, and whether your looking at a view master stereo photo or something more. The focus is disappointing at times and some scenes are more stereo that 3-D. CGI is not perfect as yet but in this film it is much better than all the commercials and trailers I had seen. I watch movies at home on my 60\\" plasma and the opening of this film is IMAX  ( you are there ) quality . The film is long but I saw it through and that's saying a lot.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Excellent beacause the insights are from the diary of a young girl and the sensitive portrail through her diary of the Lincoln White House from an almost family member. It is well written and a true account of those first years. Before the death of their young son.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am stunned by the ending of this book.  From reading the other reviews I see that I am not alone.  It is a shame that the readers were led to believe this would be a trilogy only to learn they would later be bilked for more money if they care to learn the ending to what has become a story line that makes one lose intmterest by the page. I attempted to return the novel but apparently did not do so during the grace period.  The fact that it took me longer than a week to get through the book for lack of interest should have been a sign thattmrnt I was getting nowhere fast with this story line.  Disappointment sums it up.

B00BHUB11Y|5.0|My child loves this movie.  He watches all the time, which means I watch it all the time.  It was a life saver on our trip to Florida for my family reunion.  I have to also say that my husband and I love this movie also.
0061950726|3.0|But in the end, I was disappointed and had to give it three stars.<br /><br />The book alternates between the experiences of Vivian, who was on an orphan train in 1929, and Molly, a teenager with a foster family in 2011 in Maine.<br /><br />The author does an amazing job with Vivian. I was fascinated with her story, and the author presented it in a way that left you dying to learn more. Unfortunately, the Molly story is not nearly as interesting. I know I am an old-fashioned fuddy duddy when it comes to this, but I do not think that \\"curse words\\" (as in the seven deadly words you cannot say on TV, by George Carlin) have a place in a book unless a character is extremely angry or upset and lets the f-bomb go. Here, scatological langugae was used that was not necessary to move the narrative forward.<br /><br />The Molly story is also marred by the ridiculously one-sided portrayal of the foster mother. I have been in foster situations that were far worse than what Molly goes through, and even then there were good points about the foster parents. The foster mother here is a complete caricature. One cannot believe in the 21st century that a foster mother could act so one-sidedly badly. The foster mom was completely irredeemable, which ruined the \\"Molly\\" story for me. It got to the point where the Vivian story was so much more interesting that I outwardly groaned when the Molly story came back.<br /><br />((***SPOILER ALERT***))<br /><br />I was fully engrossed in the Vivian story until the events of 1943 took place. I do not for a second believe that she would do what she did. It completely ruined the book for me. What was a thoroughly engrossing read from the Vivian point of view became unbelievable to me from then on. Such a disappointment. The Vivian story is fascinating, but the book ends totally unsatisfactorily, and the Molly story did nothing for me. A mixed bag, and too bad, because the author has much potential.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|My child loves this movie very much.  He is always trying to do poses like Kung Fu Panda.  He thinks the movie is awesome.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|When Khaled Hosseini begins this story I am so completly into this book.  However, I felt there were too many stories happening and it almost becomes a little too much by the end.  I did enjoy the book but I think &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; is his best.

Or order a physical CD.Cause the down loaded cd's don't sound very good.I give product 4 stars because I'm disapointed in how my CD turned out

B000FVRACK|5.0|Sorry, I can't give an unbiased evaluation - I simply love Rubinstein and his Polonaise is most definitely like none other.  Rubinstein is just simple unfettered genius extraordinaire - no Lang Lang effusiveness, just serious precise, light, loud and lyrical wonder.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very fun game that I can't put down! The only reason I took one star away is because you have to post everything on Facebook to get invest cash at a decent rate.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome game, Great way to pass some time. Haven't found a better free app yet!<br /> I highly recommend it to anyone
1781162646|5.0|I'm a big Steven King fan but every now and then I find a story of his I can't get into... this isn't one of those. I really enjoyed the characters, setting and story almost right off the bat.<br /><br />It has love, heroism, mystery and, of course, murder. The entire book feels very atmospheric and with every page I felt thoroughly immersed in the setting that King has crafted.<br /><br />I could go on and on but let me sum it up like this: It's Steven King doing what he does best. Should you read it? Absolutely.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but i HAD to write one for this.<br />STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW AND BUY THIS... seriously.<br />I finished this book in a day... I could NOT put it down. The whole book is in Drews POV and wow it could not have been any more perfect. AND there will be a second book! AHHHH I cannnnot wait. Emma Chase you are one brilliant writer. You will NOT be disappointed in reading this book, trust me.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Bradley Cooper and especially Jennifer Lawrence delivered outstanding performance. Family watched together and<br />it was constant laughter. One of those feel good when it's over movies.
159420411X|4.0|I found this book intersting, but after about half way through I started to get tired of the constant political and sporting references. The scope isn't as wide as I had hoped, and seems to draw too much on the authors own experiences to be able to claim universal appeal. I've managed to misplace maine, but I haven't given up looking for it yet, so there must be something in there that subconciously wants me to keep reading it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game has various levels of skill for increasing difficulty as you become better over time.<br />It is good for a quick few minutes of brain exercise or a longer playing time.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series surprised me. I wasn't expecting it to be this good.  I can't wait for more.  We have it set to record.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I like the battery pro app because it is very convenient to use easy to down load easy to understand and use.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was very touching and I loved it. August is really a wonderful kid and he is a wonder.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|I really like Gemma (not going to try for last name) in all her movies. he is ok too. it was just fun to watch
B003VPWX6K|5.0|This book is SO good, and I'm so impressed with how the author can mix humor, pathos, and serious political/historical/sociological insights into a common story.  It is a deceptively simple story, dealing with a very proper British butler during the period between WWI and WWII, who works for a member of the House of Lords, who becomes obsessed with how Germany is treated following the end of the first World War.  Much of the humor comes from how intensely dedicated the butler is to his profession and the very formal way in which he describes everything (the book is written in the first person).  While at first the main character comes across as an object of ridicule for the reader, by the end he commands respect for living his life consistent with his value system, as warped as that system might be.  I found myself tearing up at the end as he plans how to spend \\"the remains of his day.\\"  I recommend the book wholeheartedly.  One of the best I've read in a long time.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|It was a great book!!! I can't wait to read the next Diary of a Wimpy Kid book or this movie.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I love the sound quality. It Noise cancels like a dream and holds its charge for a long time. I had to give it 4 stars though because it is so hard to turn on. i still haven't found out the trick. It isn't a simple button press. Sometimes holding down the button works, sometimes repeatedly works, but most times it's some sort of combo. That is the only problem.
B0000AUHPG|1.0|I just don't get it. The film just seems like a tedious, confusing mess to me. How did it earn its legendary status?<br /><br />Once Upon a Time in the West has been hyped as Sergio Leone's best, the epitome of the Spaghetti Western genre. Having loved Leone's Dollars Trilogy, I could hardly wait to view his masterpiece epic.<br /><br />I was majorly disappointed. The storyline was unnecessarily confusing and extraordinarily slow. Unfortunately, the drawn-out complexity of the film is not suited to an explanation through self-indulgent camera angles. The whereabouts of the characters were hard to keep track of, and several events happened that were either not fully explained, or fully explained away. At the start of the film, a man is shot and loses consciousness. Then, he suddenly shows up in a bar, and besides a visible wound, is apparently completely fine. Most perplexing during my original viewing was an extremely random sexual encounter between two characters. It seemingly starts as a rape, but within a few seconds becomes consensual--and has no obvious later impact whatsoever.<br /><br />This film is very different from Leone's Dollar Trilogy, in a bad way. Once Upon A Time in the West, Leone's biggest, baddest Western, pales in comparison to even his smallest--A Fistful of Dollars.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Just refuses to acknowledge the receiver. I have cleared away everything in the room that could interfere with the signal, and it still refuses to connect. A complete waste of money, get the wired version.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Of course I wish they would have an eight season. This one keeps you on the edge of your seat.
031603441X|5.0|I knew I'd probably like this, as I love the Stones, but Keith Richard's Life turned out to be the best autobiography I've ever read.  Keith is profane, funny, wise, tender and outrageous all in one, and he comes across strongly as someone I would really love to meet in person.  Despite his sometimes deserved notorious reputation, he emerges as a multi-faceted, caring human being who can tell a story like no other.  He's charming to a fault, and this book is thoroughly delightful.  The last two pages, where he pays a last, loving tribute to his Mum, are truly priceless and heartwarming.  I absolutely loved Life, and you will too.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have played a few versions - the original and this version are the best Angry Birds to get. The Star Wars themed sounds are entertaining.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hello- All dog lovers should watch this movie as it tells a wonderful story.  And all people whoe dose not like Dogs should watch it as it might  make them Dog lovers. Thank you Tom and Ruth
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Highly recommended to read even if you watch the tv show.  Adds a lot more color and internal dialogue very important to characters I felt the show didn't explain enough (Bran and Davos specifically, who went from being the least interesting characters in the show to my favorite characters in the books.)
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|I like this movie because I like all movies where the good guy wins and the bad guy really loses.<br />The good guy is Arnold so how can that go wrong.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I LOVED the first two books, but was totally let down by the third.  Such a bummer after counting down the days until its release.  Didn't seem like there was much to the story.  When it came to the sex, it was way too much.  I found myself skimming through the parts because I got tired of the same description of his penis over and over again!  Come on Silvia, please don't let us down with the fourth book!  I will definitely read it, but am hoping it will be as good as the first two books.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Good game. But if you think you can get skins, your wrong, 10 dollars wasted trying to get skins, pathetic
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is awesome but hard you have to fly 10000 meters to beat crymson dynamo which is really really hard.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|best ever saw the concert in upper darby  also JFK love him  great concert and sound he is  the best
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|You try to connect segments of materials in such a way as to make a strong bridge.  the problem is that your finger obscures what you are dragging around so you can't properly position the pieces.<br /><br />The physics sucks.  Techniques that should be making the bridge stronger just weaken it.<br /><br />forget about using curves to strengthen the bridge.  Everything is straight line pieces.<br /><br />Things that would be done in the real world to make a bridge just don't work in this program.  Very disappointing.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I looked forward impatiently to Hosseini's new book because I loved The Kite Runner and I was not disappointed. He is an amazing writer and I remain one of his biggest fans.
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|I have to say I'm bias when it comes to the album because I'm such a huge fan of theirs. Some there songs have changed since the first time I heard them on their ep, but it's great. I love chartreuse and Farrah Fawcett hair.
B000ZELISO|2.0|The movie is entertaining but so much is missing from the book that it feels like a different story at times. I am a Potter fan but the movie left me feeling a bit disappointed. The specials features or lack thereof was adding insult to injury. If you need the movie for the collection I understand, for new people you are not missing anything if you skip it.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Over the past seceral yeaes I have used this on my phone and Palm Pilot. Works great, and I use it daily.
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|Compelling; this is the word that sums up the Millennium Trilogy for me. Having read the first chapter of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I was hooked and yes, compelled to see it through to the bitter sweet end. Both Larsson's central characters are flawed human beings: The journalist is an egoistic Narcissus while Salander is self destructive. The fact they turn out to be righteous survivors too makes them compellingly likeable human beings.
0385394233|5.0|Sheryl's candor is refreshing and spot-on.  Her ideas on shifting the paradigm are much needed in today's corporate culture. This book is just as relevant for women as it is for men. I say this because so many men don't realize they subconsciously promote the \\"Donna Reed\\" culture of many decades ago.<br />Definitely smart reading for someone in their 20s that is just starting their career.  Perfect college graduation gift !<br />As someone in my mid-30s - I have so many friends that I now realize have been leaning BACK :(  .... And for me - it validates that i am NOT alone in some frustration I have felt over the first decade of my career.<br />I encourage all women to \\"read\\" this book - and if you think you are too busy = buy the audio CD like I did and listen to it on your way to/from work.... and you will find yourself listening to it over and over again.<br />BRAVO to Sheryl for being outspoken on this extremely important topic !
0788812408|5.0|This movie will always have great memories for me of when I was a little girl and used to dream of being Ariel lol. I recently purchased this vhs movie for a friend of mine's little girls, and I'm glad to hear that they are loving it too!

0446310786|4.0|I've just began reading this pulitzer prize winning novel, so I cannot say much, but so far it definitely lives up to the hype! I'm excited to find out what happens in the rest of this book, it's rare that you find a piece of literature, considered a classic, that I actually enjoy reading!

B00821PCJS|4.0|it another sci-fi show and while i do love it. the only downside is the show that amazon has didnt added closed captioning. Otherwise it is a great show to see.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Wow...I read the book without reading all the reviews first.  I had it delivered to my Kindle on the release day.  I had been highly anticipating this book for a long time.  I thought the first two books of the series were amazing and couldn't wait to finish the trilogy.  So yes, I was a little confused as I got to the end of the book and realized there was no way to wrap everything up.  That being said, I was only upset that there would be more books because that meant I had to wait for the rest of the story.  The cost of another two books?  Let's be honest, if I didn't have these to read, I would have bought two other books in their place.  Not a big deal at all to me to be honest.  I just hope the next 2 don't take as long to come out as this one did.<br /><br />If I could have, I probably would have given this book 3.5 stars.  I still enjoyed the book, but it was a let down after the first two which I'd easily give 5 stars.  The reason for the lower rating...it just didn't move much.  Or rather Eva and Gideon's story didn't move as much as it could have.  And the Brett thing.  I get that feeling of \\"the one that got away\\" even when you are completely and uttterly in love with someone else.  I understand the feelings behind it.  What I didn't like in the whole storyline was Eva stringing him along.  The random texting him for no reason.  Let's be serious, this isn't a guy you are friends with, so sending a random text is ridiculous when you say you have no intention of being with him.  There was some filler I really didn't care about.  The Will stuff was boring and pointless.  I'm not sure where they are going with the Megumi stuff, but eh...<br /><br />Still, all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I like a break from the constant angst.  Eva was a little annoying and selfish...but then again, probably fairly typical of a 23/24 year old just out of college.  So I'll let it slide until the next book.  I guess I'm a little odd because I liked the storyline with Cary and Tatiana and find it interesting.  And I thought her parents giving in to old love was sad and poignant and didn't hate it like so many others did.<br /><br />I get that people were upset thinking this would be the last book and the ending was just odd, as in it was no ending and no cliffhanger really, but still, the book was fairly good.  Does it deserve 5 stars, no way.  4 stars, probably not quite, but 1 or 2 stars are way too low.  I couldn't give it 3 because it felt just a little better than average, so went with the 4.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Was worth the wait loved it but can't wait til the next one alot of sex and lovemaking in it

B004UNX1LS|4.0|I does work on kindle fire. Well at least my kindle. But that's not why I didn't give 5 stars. I think this app should work without Wi-Fi because if I want to listen to good music at home I have lots of ways. But if I want to take good music with me I can't! Why do we need Wi-Fi on this app anyway? Please answer me. Im not kidding. I seriously don't agree with &quot; u need Wi-Fi to use this app. Not cool
B004YW4L5K|2.0|I really wanted to like this book -- love the idea of the old gods, and was hoping for something a bit like Tom Robbins' _Jitterbug Perfume_. In Gaiman's story, however, the characters are all deeply unpleasant in a greasy gangster way, and there's a whole lot of getting punched in the face and thrown from moving cars, kinda like a bad episode of Law & Order. Guess I'm just not the right reader for this.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is fun and interesting. You build a village and battle the Boggans. I love the movie and this game is just like the movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The story was interesting and kept the reader wanting to find out what happens next. The subject matter was disgusting to me so I skipped over the trashy parts (and they were numerous) I think it was a little unrealistic to believe a virgin would suddenly like to be tortured.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As most of the other reviews state, this is an incredibly addictive game. Tho a bit short a lot of fun. Well worth the money, I'd recommend it to any one who loves solving mind riddles and puzzles A+++
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I would certainly recommend this compared to other expensive ones. One thing i dont like about it is the waist strap. It should have been made optional. For people who dont like using waist strap, it either hangs like a tail behind you, or it pokes on your bag as you walk. Really distracting. Except for this downside (atleast for me), this is of very good quality and great value for the price!

B009XTF8KQ|3.0|\\"The Possession\\" is yet another supernatural horror in which a young girl starts behaving strangely because of some mysterious entity. Produced by Sam Raimi (and other fourteen producers), \\"The Possession\\" is a throwback to the 70's horror films including \\"The Exorcist.\\" The film, which purports to be a character driven thriller, is not that thrilling because of the clichéd storytelling and not-so-interesting characters.<br /><br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Edward Blake/The Comedian of \\"Watchmen\\") is Clyde Brenek, a recently divorced basketball coach and father of two daughters Emily (Natasha Calis) and Hannah (Madison Davenport). However, since the day they bought an old box at a yard sale, Emily starts to act strangely,<br /><br />The film's story is based on a Los Angeles Times article \\"A jinx in a box?\\" by Leslie Gornstein July 25, 2004, about a small wooden box - a \\"dybbuk box\\" - put on an online auction. I found the original article more intriguing than the film that relies on genre clichés. Also, sometimes I just couldn't know whether or not I should take the film's \\"scares\\" seriously, including the MRI sequence that made me scratch my head.<br /><br />Directed by Ole Bornedal (\\"Nightwatch\\" shot twice by the same director), \\"The Possession\\" keeps us interested throughout because of its dramatic strength, but as a horror the film just lacks originality and creativity that this story really needs.

0817439390|5.0|I am regular Amazon buyer but this is the first time I actually comment on the purchase. I started with the photography last year and with the time I have achieved incremental improvement in my photos. I was thinking about purchasing of Understanding Exposure for a while and thought that the book cannot teach me anyithing new about the exposure. Man was I wrong. Bryan Peterson's book is the best text I have read about the photography. The first chapter alone made me twice as better photographer as I was before reading it. Authors' writting style is so easy to follow and interesting.  Mr. Peterson is not trying to teach you tips and tricks (to some extend yes to achieve envisioned results) but to bring closer common sense principles of correct exposure which than can be applied to the every possible shooting situation. He really teaches you how to fish instead providing free lunch. This is a must have book in everybody's library.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|Interesting book about people with disorders.  The ending was a real surprise but I would recommend this book to anyone who knows someone who has any type of a disorder like eating or cutting.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game for a blast from the past!  From relaxing fun levels to hard and challenging levels. Good way to pass some spare time.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|The movie was good but the quality was awful! We had to restart amazon several times bc of loading issues.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The best book yet in the Crossfire series, I could not put it down. Can't wait until the next book!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Mads Mickleson is incredible and really captures the famous character. Supporting cast has fantastic chemistry. The show is one of the few currently on tv that really capture psycological terror.
B008Y73940|4.0|Some parts were cheesy, so could have been better,  it had a few good actors but it almost felt like a comedy
B00992CF6W|5.0|7.1 update was well worth the wait. Best app out there in my opinion. Also don't buy anything made by Aleksander Polonski or whatever his name is.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Thought I would read the book before I watched to movie and was not disappointed in the book, however the movie was little disappointing after reading the book.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Interesting enough.  Too much blogging stuff. The parts about her adjustments in the US are great. I wanted more about her beaus' time in London.  If you like reading about the \\"immigrant experience\\" then youll like it.  As the child of an immigrant I liked it.  It made me want to ask my Mom more about her initial time in the States.
1878424319|5.0|Four simple steps that will profoundly change your life!! Don Miguel Ruiz shares 4 practices that will make anyones life better!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this show, very suspensful! The cast is great together and I am definitly in for the long haul.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I really love Doctor Who...all the seasons.  I like this season.  Amy and Rory are good additions to the Doctor!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This show rocks!!!!!!  My husband and I fell in love with this show this year.  Can't wait for the next season.  We loved it!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I found this book on kickstarter.com as a give away for the omni VR. I went to Amazing and read a sample  of the book and found myself drawn into the story. I read the entire book in two days. I can't wait for the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Now that the new 7.1 update is out it seems better than ever. It adds  buckets cakes fire...AND 4 SPAWN EGGS!
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|i bought it to use on my Nexus 7, and it works great except for the circle pads are awful. but mapping is easy and sometimes the controls get funky.
B002M87W9K|5.0|I have watched this on my computer through the instant buy program. There is not much else to say about this outstanding, classical musical other than it is in my top 5 of all time. If you like musicals at all, this is timeless.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I thought it was going to be a shoot-em-up movie but was pleasantly surprised that it was a murder mystery.
B008MM9630|4.0|Slow going but fun nonetheless.  Wish the quests were a wee bit easier to complete and the 'special' currency was also easier to acquire.  Still a great game though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game I think it is amazing and I hope they make more like this or add additional levels!!!!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book was fantastic reading. The book described many of my own beliefs. I would recommend this book to any one.
B005KELW26|3.0|Where the black and purple are stitched,it is uneven.I lay it on my leg and get scratched. Love the color.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|then it went super cheap, so I decided what the heck.  I knew the basics going in... families are starving and compete in a 'game' where only one person comes out alive.  After reading it, it was so much more.  It was sad and morbid in parts, but there was the underlying story of Katniss and Gale/Peeta.  The deaths of the players in book 1 are described in detail and are just sad.  I had to keep reminding myself that these were kids!  Book 2 was my favorite.  Thats where we really get to find out more about Peeta and see him and Katniss.  And we find out about the rebellion.  There are light romantic scenes in the trilogy but a lot of violence... a lot!  It's hard to describe the books without giving too much away.  Just read it!  I almost didn't because it was always marketed as a young adult/teen series, but I'm glad I did.  I havent seen the first movie because I know it can't possibly do justice  to the book (and I dont want the disappointment).
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it Yah the updates. are slow and it has a new updates cake,spawners,buckets,milk,7.0 is awesome soon it will be like coumputer I cant wait till NPC villagers and mooshrum island and command block Wichita gives you time travel awesome.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I couldn't put this book down!! It was so good!! Definitely would recommend this book to any fellow read8 er.
B004N66XYE|5.0|I actually saw this first on PBS and then decided for order it for my library.<br />The plot line and characters in this sequel are just as good as the original.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|The calculator app has worked very well for adding and percentages ect.  But, I have try to more complex math functions.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I give this book three stars because I love the first two books and now instead of drawing this story to a conclusion we've got to wait even longer for the next book and I'm sure some will love this idea but me personally need some closure with Ms. Sylvia I've read almost every book she's published and with almost every book there is no closure the only series I've read that actually ended was the marked series and I loved it but the renegade angels series loved it but still waiting for two different books to be released to find out what happens and now the crossfire series and the dreamwalker series has been shelved due to publishing issues so I'll never get any answers with that series so I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this I'm tired of investing my time and money in all these series that may not ever end please give me a break Sylvia I love your work I just think you should work on one series at a time til it's done just my opinion
193700788X|5.0|This book did an excellent job of concluding the &#34;Sookie Stackhouse&#34; series.  It was enjoyable, the author brought back all of the characters and concluded their stories.  All in all, a very enjoyable read.
B005R32L66|3.0|Had to load it for an interview. Desktop version would not work, had to uninstall ver 4. To win8.  Now it works. Mobile wouldn't let me sign in. I asked for username and password. None of the temp codes provided were recognized. Finally got that corrected. Now if I only knew people that used skype.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game to play.  Easy to learn. A little addictive - hard to put down. More difficult levels are truly challenging. Great for exercising your spatial thinking muscles. Also has nice liquid sound effects!  Would definitely buy again.  Only con is very minor: I wish you could see the finished board a little longer, but it's immediately covered by &#34;play again?&#34;
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is deceptively simple, but will keep you hooked for hours. You will need to put your thinking cap on. One thing I appreciate is the opportunity to repeat each pattern, seeking the ideal solution.
B008220BLG|5.0|A very good zombie movie. It is not you tupical zombie movie. It is not real gorry, it has a plot to it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I consumed this book, as all of his books, with a passion.  I love the way he writes.  He is a true storyteller.  Have read every one of his books so far and can hardly wait for the next one.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|Although I have been natural for almost two years, I decided to cut my hair again and follow the curly girl method. And let me tell you my hair has never felt better!  This book is a must read for those wanting to truly embrace their textures hair!
B000FA675C|5.0|One of my all-time favorite stories. Anyone who loves puzzles and mysteries will be captivated by this story. I've now read it four times, and each time I pick up something new that I previously missed.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Just as excellent as previous books. What a story teller. An eye opener and quite sad . Don't delay read it now
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the Weather channel app for my phone. Today, it let me know, by signaling, that there was dangerous weather possible nearby. The weather forcast is, because of the GPS in my phone, able to give me weather conditions and forecast that are right in my neighborhood. It is a free app, too, which makes it worth all I paid for it, LOL.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|If you have the other 2 movies, you have to get this one, of course! Wish they would have put the pug dog in this one though!
0756407125|5.0|Awesome book I love the king killer series, I could sit an read this book all day which I plan on doing
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|So this is approximately how it happened! I'm sure there was some drama added but this was really amazing to watch how the military handles stuff like this.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Well when I got this I thought that u could talk to Tom but I can't that sucks and there is only two things you can do in the free version
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I've loved fantasy since I was a little girl. The C. S. Lewis & J. R. R. Tolkien book series have been favorites of mine as an adult. I have the other hobbit movies so had to have this one. Well done like the other 3 but a little disappointing that they didn't get the first book into one DVD. Oh well, guess it makes the movies a little more detailed!
0425263924|4.0|I enjoyed the book. 2 days before this book came out I re-read the other two. I read those a day each. When Entwined with you came out at midnight I started to read. I read this book in 1 day. When I finished I was so disappointed and now have to wait longer to get the ending of what is going to happen.<br /><br />I just hope the other books won't take as long to release.
B008VJYWMY|5.0|I fell in love with Il Divo several years ago & I have all of their albums. Amazon always has the best prices on books, CDs & DVDs!
B000JCK3ZG|5.0|I really enjoy the X-Men series.  I think it is one of the few series that hold up as they evolve.
B00AF6B22E|3.0|At the very beginning of the movie, there's a nude scene that I could have done without and which doesn't add ANYTHING to the movie - definitely could have left that scene out! Other than this, it's a good movie.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it really is a fun game, although mine will not update.<br />it says I can ouch the button to do so, but when I do it says &quot; there has been an error downloading minecraft - pocket edition. please try again &quot; and no matter how many times I restart my kindle or try again it will not download
B009AMANH4|5.0|This seemed a realistic portrayal of the human side of the abolishment of slavery in our country. The personal life of Lincoln & his family was especially touching.
0143038419|1.0|I want to read this book because I love the movie. But it seems that everyone can't stand this woman. So this is pretty disappointing and makes me not want to read this. I'm assuming Julia Roberts made the character much more likable, because she doesn't come off as self absorbed or whiny in the movie. So they must've changed a lot of it. Anyone think I should give the book a try?
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I did enjoy the movie since the character Reacher was just just like reading a Lee Child book about him.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|*4 1/2 Stars*<br /><br />\\"You were with me. The whole time. There wasn't a second that passed when you weren't on my mind. You own me, Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, I belong to you.\\"<br /><br />Just like you, I have been waiting patiently for the third (and i thought final) installment to the Crossfire series. Now don't laugh at me, but I had it on my calender with a reminder alert ever since I found out what the release date was going to be. Yes, I'm THAT big of a nerd! This series definitely was at the top of my \\"favorite things\\" list; favorite author, favorite series, favorite book boyfriend.\\" With Entwined with You, Sylvia Day gave us more, more, more! More intensity, more sexual heat, more love, and more frustrations. Even though Entwined with You wasn't my favorite out of the series, it still rocked my world!<br /><br />Oh Gideon and Eva! Your love for each other scares the living s*** out of me! Seriously, just when I think, oh god, too intense, too intense, I sit back and think to myself, I want that for myself! I want to love someone so much, that it physically hurts when you are not with them. I want someone to love me so much that they will drop everything and anything to be by my side, protect me from all the evil in the world, and just be my world. THAT my friends is exactly the kind of love that Gideon and Eva share. THAT is the kind of love that takes people forever to find, the other half of themselves.<br />\\"Day One of my life was the day I met you.\\"<br /><br />Entwined with You picks up where Reflected in You, Crossfire #2, ended, the aftermath of the bombshell that was dropped! To find out the length that Gideon would go through to protect Eva from her past astonishes me. These two both have pasts that have scarred them in some way, and they both just want to take on the other's pain, it's such a beautiful thing.<br /><br />\\"We are totally dysfunctional.\\" \\"I prefer 'selectively deviant.' But we'll keep that to ourselves.\\"<br /><br />Looking from the outside in, some people might say that Gideon and Eva's relationship is unhealthy, or it's like a train wreck waiting to happen. It might be all that, but you can't argue that when they get together, they are HOT as HELL! Their sexual encounters are sometimes hot and heavy, and other times they are soft and tender. There is a scene in one of the clubs that Gideon owns....WOW! It's THAT good! Good enough, that you just might need a cold shower afterwards. So HOT in fact, I read the scene over and over again! Don't judge me! *smirks*<br /><br />I want to give a little shout-out to my other favorite couple Mark and Steven. Mark is Eva's boss, and I am SO jealous of the working relationship they have with each other by the way! Steven is Mark's boyfriend and they are SO CUTE together it kills me! Big things in store for these guys!<br /><br />All in all, Sylvia Day rocked this book! I was a good girl and stayed away from any kind of reviews until I finished the book, so I was one of those readers that said WHAT THE HELL?!  at the end of Entwined with You. After learning that there were going to be more installments, I was so THRILLED! I can't get enough of this gut wrenching, emotionally exhausting, sexy roller coaster ride! Bring it on woman! I need more answers!!!<br /><br />\\"If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.\\"Gideon and Eva's relationship is unhealthy, or it's like a train wreck waiting to happen.

B00932AA5G|1.0|The movie was so boring there was no way I could stand watching the whole movie. Movies like this should not be listed
B000002LQR|5.0|music is subjective you like it or you dont<br />listening to the clips that amazon has on here should give you good idea
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This started out as a great idea and then went south with &#34;What?&#34;  After several seasons I quit watching it.  Somebody should tell Hollywood that cocaine is not making a better script...it makes an ugly mess.  At any rate I loved watching Eureka, until it went somewhere I just didn't want to go.  First Season was best. Would like to see more of &#34;Carter&#34;!!!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I love it. I use it from time to time whenever I need to take a nap. Its great. you can use your own ring tones.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Having been a fan of the Wizard of Oz my whole life, I eagerly anticipated this movie. I was NOT disappointed. The cast is great, the story line is too. Too many people's reviews tried to compare to the original but you can not do that. This is not a remake or an update, it is the next in line of the series of books written by the author who wrote something like 12 or thirteen books on OZ and this movie reflects the next edition NOT a remake or update. It is a really good movie, close to the real book and was well worth buying.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The Anker mouse is one of the best mice I have ever used. There are so many ways to customize the mouse to your personal settings. For example the weight can be adjusted, the color can be changed to any color imaginable, the buttons can be programmed to do almost anything, and so much more. This mouse has exceeded all expectations.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|...but I am done with extended series especially with this genre. I haven't even finished chapter three. I LOVED the first two. I told anyone who would listen how great this series was only to eat my words. Why must it be ruined by becoming a five book series?! I am starting to tire of all the trilogies and other multiple book series. I seriously don't have the energy or time to try and maintain release dates for this ongoing phase. Lately, nothing is more refreshing than a great SINGLE book with lots of character development, angst, romance, a solid plot...PLEASE for the love of us that are worn thin by all this craziness, give us some more singles!!! Or another This Man series!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|i don't get it.  There's really no camera feature. you have to have the Kindle facing what you want to take a picture of, but there's no way to see what your taking the picture of.
B0090EJ99A|2.0|I'm glad I didn't see this movie in theaters.  It was more of the same from his prior movies, though not as funny.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very interesting with the underlying history weaved into the stories.  Really enjoy that part!!  Highly recommend it to those who enjoy the history of that time.
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|I have listened to John since.... 2003?  Out of all of his rather beautiful and interesting and special albums, this one is simply HOLY.  Strong spiritual vibe. Listen to it in the dark.  It's brilliant.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Although I liked the way the series actually ended for Sookie, I was disappointed in this book's story. I like to see Eric, Bill and the vamps involved in the storyline, but this book hardly touched on them. The action was pretty flat. That about says it.
B003FFEX8C|3.0|the movie was decent thanks to Halle Berry, plot was alright 3 stars total for a good time filler thanks Amazon
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I down loaded this clock for when I am traveling, it works just fine<br />for what I need, if you have a hard time waking up while on vacation<br />and you have a schedule to keep, this is the clock for you.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|So I really like this game, my 6 year old son loves it ! An not a lot of reading that keeps him interested an ME happy he is reading ! :) I would recommend it to kids an adults !!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is so full of suspense and happiness (sometimes) and Katniss and Peeta are totally in love. Katniss is a bit iffy about this whole fake relationship. What will happen next?
B000U6BT40|4.0|Good combination of drama and comedy. Characters interaction are memorable. Plots, while fun are sometimes unrealistic, however, they will make you do some thinking as to say that they may be possible.
B005LLSZNM|3.0|a bit dark, but kept it going.. interesting, like the story, not the bikers, too caricatures of bad guys... ok
B009AMAGXK|5.0|The description says there are no special features, but there are lots. Those features, however, are not on the regular dvd edition. If that makes a difference to you, definitely go with the blu ray combo.
B005PK56TA|3.0|good start, too violent, got a bit stale towards the 4 episode, not a big arc, needs to move on... too dark, confusing; dead or alive? hmm
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am so ready for the next book...on the edge of my seat- this was the best book in the series yet!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun to play very time consuming not boring at all I enjoy it keeps me pretty well entertained so yea
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is a must own movie for the 80's kids who spent all of their quarters at the arcade!  The flashbacks to the old 80's arcade games will fill you with nostalgia.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The Good Wife is great in that it shows the politics of the judicial system, tackles contemporary issues our nation is dealing with right now, and has amazing storylines of every episode! The characters are spectacular. I was so not expecting to become addicted to this random show I saw on Amazon Prime! I even bought the last season, and now I'm beyond impatient for the next season!
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I love Star Trek Next Generation.  Every season, every episode!  Highly Recommended if you liked the original series.  Patrick Stewart makes an excellent Capt. Picard.
B0009RLK2Q|5.0|I give it four out of five because of the atmosphere of the movie not so much the story. I would say this lines up as one of my favorite horror movies ever, and I've only first seen it about two years ago. I'd strongly recommend this movie to any horror or mystery viewer, I personally believe it will blow most horror movies out of the water.
B000I3SYEI|3.0|what would star trek be without William Shatner hamming it up Khannnnnn!!! priceless as usual I enjoy the whole movie it reminds me of growing up. even went to a convention with my older brothers.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book presents an inside look at the living nightmare manifest in present day North Korea;  the population is treated as, in essence,  disposable subhuman protoplasm.  Our protagonist evolves into, however, an unlikely champion of human spirit,  and keeps the reader engaged in his journey through life, despite the terrible ordeals he must undergo, and also take part in.  This work is a suspenseful ride but also an uplifting one.  Excellent read.
B00BYH6OJO|3.0|i am a fan of Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe but this movie was lacking good story but it just did not get there.
B004GYY714|5.0|I used to be a fan of shortwave radio, but with TuneIn I can listen to music from everywhere and without the static<br />Great!
B000VYNYN0|5.0|My daughter is into this genre and even though I am not she suggested i watch it the funniest movie ever I can't wait to see the other evil deads
B00AEFY66U|2.0|This earlier version of Gatsby is terribly boring and unbelievably underplayed by Redford et.al.  I was surprised because of the caliber of the cast.  It does not compare with the new movie even though the new one is a bit glitsy..
0061743526|5.0|Harper Lee has captured the depression-era South in all its blessedness and brokenness. Written from the perspective of the book's main female character, To Kill a Mockingbird is a brilliant portrait of family, race, hypocrisy, redemption, and most of all, true love. To walk in another man's shoes, to value people for what they are rather than what they are not, these are the lessons of this supremely written book.<br /><br />If you have seen the movie but never read the book, you will find some differences but many, many similarities, right down to the wording. The additional detail of the book provides a fuller picture particularly of the culture of Maycomb and the Finch family. I love the movie, but I loved the novel even more because of these additional details. For example, Mrs. DuBose played a small but memorable role in the film but in the book her character is fleshed out in a much more complete way, in some ways foreshadowing the story of Boo Radley and underlining the central premise of the book.<br /><br />Stellar writing, a compelling story, a powerful reflection on what human beings are and what we could be. I highly recommend this truly great novel.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Delightful tale.  Able to bring a smile to any face in any generation.  The last words of the script says it all...<br />&#34;That'll do.&#34;
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Very real and honest interpretation of mental illness. Actors were fantastic.Kudos to the cast and writers .Academy award material for sure .
B002UHSDUK|5.0|Something never comes never leads to nothing<br />(Well, it was delivered electronically)<br />Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close<br />(Greatest Hits?  Of COURSE it satisfies)<br />Closer to the prize at the end of the rope<br />(Or the ethernet cable, or wireless)<br />All night long I dream of the day<br />(I Can Listen to This Music)<br />When it comes around then it's taken away<br />(Wife Puts on Pop Music.  Damn, I'm gonna miss her)<br />Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most<br />(Dave Grohl?  That feeling is Euphoria)<br />The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost<br />(That would be spooky.  Let's keep you alive and making more great Foo Tunes)
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kid liked this game ... It is pretty cool and I would recommend it to kids 6 to 10 yrs old ...great game ...
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Just another gangster movie not really it has a lot to offer. The story can be a bit intense at times even shocking depending on your<br />exposure to these kind of films. The cast is excellent audio & video were superb,
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed the entire series. The humor, camaraderie, and stories were well written. The Fifth Season did not disappoint!
B005WQ4RP6|4.0|You are really drawn into this movie by the exceptional acting and the music.  If you like a thriller because of it's evilness, then you will give it 5 stars.
B007N31YH0|5.0|Well, maybe not so &#34;modern&#34; anymore, given that it's almost 40 years old.  But hey, what can I say that hasn't been said?  Newman, Redford, Shaw, a terrific supporting cast, a clever story, and a memorable soundtrack.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book may appeal to those who fancy themselves as scientific intellectuals.I liked it because I love a good God story!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book had a tremendous amount of detail and was a fantastic read. I felt like I was getting deep into his life during the whole book.
B00B2166BS|1.0|My Nexus 10 Pogo Cable dis-charges my Nexus instead of charging it.<br /><br />I had to go back to my USB cable again so that I can charge my Nexus 10.<br /><br />I'm rather disappointed to say the least.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Wow, after two excellent books Sylvia Day betrays us by writing a piece of trash. What a complete disappointment to her fans. Eva has become needy and insecure, Gideon has become a weirdo with control issue problems. No more of this trash for me. Learn to respect your fans Sylvia, you won't survive without us.
B00CWVFVUE|5.0|Good movie. I don't really like chick flicks but I did like this movie. Didn't have to buffer at all or anything. Even my best friend (who also hates chick flicks) liked it. Glad I bought it.

0307352153|3.0|As I read through \\"Part One: The Extrovert Ideal,\\" I thought I had a winner. I thought I had a book that I was going to be able to say to all of you out there that are introverts and writers (because most actual writers are introverts (and I say it that way to exclude people (celebrities) who \\"write\\" books but don't really do the actual writing)), \\"You need to read this book!\\" But, as it turns out, I was wrong.<br /><br />So what happened? Well, Susan Cain (the author) did. As it turns out, she wasn't really interested in introversion, she was actually interested in why she was afraid of public speaking. As many people do, she tied the fear of public speaking to her introversion. It's a great stereotype, right? Introverts are scared to speak in public? Except that it's wrong. Numerous studies have shown that fear of public speaking has nothing to do with introversion. Extroverts have the same fear of public speaking that introverts have. Meaning, if you're scared of getting up in front of people and giving a speech, you are just as likely to be an extrovert as an introvert (possibly more likely, because we think extroverts make up a larger portion of society). The initial section, the research about extroverts and the rise of our extroverted society is quite good and interesting (but it's not worth buying the whole book). It's where the actual, objective research happened.<br /><br />After that, though... well, it begins an exploration of why she's still scared of public speaking even though she's been doing it for years.<br /><br />She starts with biology and how much of introversion may be nature and how much nurture. Some of that is also interesting, especially the newer studies focused on children that are trying to differentiate the nature/nurture debate. However, as she went on, she relied more and more on \\"maybe\\"s and \\"might\\"s rather than actual data. Because there was no solid data to back up any of the claims she wanted to make, so she relied on speculationto make her points. Sometimes, it was her own speculation. And I don't have a problem with speculating, but I do have an issue with speculation being presented as evidence.<br /><br />The other thing she did was to rely heavily on anecdotal evidence, \\"I heard a story once...,\\" to prove her points. That's just as bad as speculation. I mean, it's the same as me saying \\"one time, this friend of mine found a dead cow in the woods with all of its organs removed\\" to prove that aliens exist. Or that aliens target cows because they like cheese (yes, Briane, that was for you). At one point, she even uses a story Mark Twain told. Really? Because he was know for his non-fiction?<br /><br />The worst part, though, is that she over-generalized her own brand of introversion as being what all introverts are like, and that's just not true. The introvert/extrovert thing is not something that's cut and dried like that. It's known as the introvert/extrovert spectrum, and it's called that for a reason. But she very happily lumped all introverts into her specific type of introversion, and my own introversion is nothing like hers. For one thing, I don't have a problem with public speaking. At all. I spent years and years getting up in front of people and talking, and the only time I ever had an issue with it was 5th grade, the first time I had to give an oral book report. She also equates introversion with shyness, which is also not true. Shyness, like fear of public speaking, is not something that only introverts lay claim to. Again, shyness is something that falls across the introvert/extrovert spectrum. [At one point, she does, kind of, say this, but, then, she goes on talking about it and discussing it as if it was a purely introvert issue.] But she was a shy child; therefore, all introverts must be shy.<br /><br />If the book had continued to focus on society (as in the first section) and how introverts can make a place for themselves in a society that holds up extroversion as theideal (by the way, the US is one of the most extroverted societies on the planet), as the full title suggests, it would have been a good read. However, it really just goes offtrack and explores how introverts can get over their fear of public speaking (because, you know, that's the assumption, that all introverts are scared of this). In short, it becomes a self help book, and I really wasn't looking for a self help book (nor was it marketed as one). I mean, really, she spends probably 1/3 of the book dealing with strategies and studies and plans about how to get over the fear of public speaking. It was like a big bait-and-switch.<br /><br />At the very end (for, maybe, 5 pages), she did talk about the issue of children that are introverts in classrooms designed for extroverts, and that was interesting, but it's the kind of thing that really could have benefited from a closer look. It has to do with how, as a society, we mess up our kids by trying to get them to be one way (an extrovert) when they're not. It's the equivalent of forcing left-handed kids to write with their right hands; it's just not so visual. [And this issue of the extrovert designed class is pretty much everywhere I guess. Desks arranged in \\"pods\\" so that students can work together instead of individually. That's prevalent at my kids' school, too, so that was an eye opener that that's what that's about.]<br /><br />Anyway, unless you have a fear of public speaking and need to do it, I would just skip this book. I wish I had. I dislike finishing a book frustrated at the lack of information the author actually gave.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Beautiful music that's very easy to listen to and enjoy. Country/folksy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, even if you aren't into country
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game in all my spare time some people think that I'm addicted but I think that I just like it a lot
B001EBWING|5.0|This is one of the classics everyone can watch together.  We love reciting so many of the lines from this movie, one-liners that make you want to watch it again and again.  Dramatic, dark brooding but sweet and sentimental Rick.  Here's lookin' at you kid...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is awesome i love it. When i am bored it just lifts my spirits. I love this game.
B0042VVLJM|5.0|Great movie!  Brings the classical age to life and sheds a new light on the greatest composer and his contemporaries.  Amazing music, acting, costumes, sets and cast.  It deserved all of the awards it received.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Nice game. Don't have to be on everyday. Easy to play. Basic. An untrained monkey could play. But still enjoyable
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I wanted to relive this time in my life as I saw this happen many years ago. This movie took me back and it was right on the mark.
B0070ZLZ1G|1.0|A more accurate title would have been: A Meandering Survey of Desperate, Expensive Efforts to Teach What Should Have Been Taught at Home.<br /><br />As the father of a 6 and 10 year old, I read this book in the hopes of finding something that would allow me to instill things like, oh, grit, optimism, gratitude, work ethic... ANYTHING... there is literally nothing in this book that is applicable to anyone with an IQ above 70.<br /><br />The book asks one question over and over: Is there some sort of gov. program that can take make up for bad or no parenting?<br /><br />The answer, in the authors final chapter, seems to be an over-arching pre-cradle to post-college nanny state that will somehow efficiently replace the myriad of programs already in place.  Never, however, is the burden of raising children into productive citizens to be placed on their actual parents, it seems.  There was brief mention of a program that teaches parents how to treat their children more like \\"high grooming rats.\\"  You know, those rats who lick their little rat-lings a lot.  Those rat-lings apparently grow up more well-adjusted.  So, a gov't program is in place to teach \\"parents\\" how to... I guess, act somewhat like \\"parents\\" or at least fake their way through it.<br /><br />On the other end of the spectrum, if you are terribly worried that your Harvard child is going to rush out and become an investment banker, the author has advice for you also.  I just can't remember what it was since I was trying not to shoot myself out of boredom since I am like the 99%+ of people who will read the book who are neither neglectful shitty parents or part of the Harvardian New World Order.<br /><br />The author seems to congratulate himself on coming up with the idea that character and grit somehow matter.  And that SAT scores alone won't predict success.  And that going through to the end of college is a sign of stick-tuitiveness and predictor of great things, unless really the sign of great things is exactly the opposite... which he also argues.<br /><br />His book is about as useful as saying that \\"athletic ability\\" and \\"motivation\\" might have something to do with winning NBA championships.  Ya think?<br /><br />And before you click this review as Not Helpful, I challenge you to put ONE COMMENT below that gives a single idea from the book that isn't something my 10 year old could tell you.  So far, 11 people have voted that the review was NOT HELPFUL, while not one of them has posted one useful idea from the book.<br /><br />If anything, the glowing reviews here on Amazon seem to be fraudulent.  Because frankly I can't see how an grown-ass adult could read this book and think, \\"Character?!  Grit?!  Good God, I never thought those things were important before!\\"
B00007BKVC|5.0|I did not see this movie when it was in the theaters and was completely surprised how so full of action it contained. The trailor truck driver was the funniest as he appeared many times and was funnier each time especially near the end.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|This was a great payday for Bruce.  Hollywood please don't make us endure another of your money-maker serials....  I for one would have PO'd had I spent movie theater money for this one.  If you like a thin plot with lots of killing and blowing up stuff, this is the movie for you.  If you want something that you you need to follow and think about &#34;a little&#34;.  Drop this and go watch Shallow Hal.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app all the time and actually have this one linked to a widget. Love them both. I can read the same books on my phone and my computer and sync them both so I do not loose my place on either one.
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. I think it does a great job of expressing the type of strong conflict, rage and love that can so often be present between brothers and between sons and fathers. As well, this film speaks to some extent to the great pain and conflict that is typically characteristic within a family that suffered the throes of having had an alcoholic parent (or in this case father). Tom Hardy's depiction of rage is awesome as he demonstrates once again his fine acting skill. This film was so perfectly cast and no-one could have been cast better than Nolte.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|My favorite part of this app is the fact that I can change the color of the notes just like a normal sticky note. Therefore, I can use it to organize information like specific directions etc.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This is DeNiro at his classic best. In some ways this film reminds me of Herzog's &#34;Fitzcaroldo&#34; even though there are significant differences between the two. A great story and great acting.
1616614609|5.0|Android: Netrunner is easily one of the best card games I have ever played. The game is incredibly dynamic. Most of this is due to the differences in approaches between the two players. This is the only game I know of where opposing players (Corporations & Runners), despite sharing similar goals, take vastly different approaches to achieving those goals (Corporations advance agendas, while Runners attempt to steal agendas). The game rules aren't complicated, but there are a number of them. The core set is the perfect introductory tool. It comes with over 200 cards, allowing for a significant amount of deckbuilding. What's even better is the distribution model Fantasy Flight Games utilizes for a number of its card games, including this one.<br /><br />Android: Netrunner is a Living Card Game. It differs from a Collectible Card Game (or Trading Card Game) in that distribution is fixed. Each month a new data pack is released. Data packs include 3 copies of 20 different cards, and each box comes with exactly the same cards. This eliminates the need to buy in bulk, HOPING to find the cards you need (a.k.a. chasing). The end result is a card game that's built not on privilege or access, but on skill.
0425263924|4.0|When I read the initial reviews, I was a little leary about reading this third of the series. But I am glad I did. Maybe I have a different outlook on what is developing with the main characters, but I am glad to see they are starting to mature and become more comfortable with their choices.<br /><br />As in any series, different characters are developed to help aid the story line. And Sylvia has given us a peak at what direction she just may pursue. Could it be the Russian theme, the Brette theme or maybe something yet to be developed? I guess I enjoy trying to figure out what direction an author will take my reading.<br /><br />My suggestion is to go into this book with an open mind and take the character development with honest scrutiny. Don't base your expectations on what other readers have said (well, except maybe mine).<br /><br />And as a P.S. - the sexual content is quite lovely, too. Happy Reading!
0385349947|5.0|I haven't read this yet (although I do intend to). I just needed to share that Amazon is suggesting that I buy this along with \\"Oh, The Places You'll Go\\" and that is absolutely amazing. Amazon, you are awesome.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Season 2 was just as good as Season 1. I Cannot wait for season 3 to be released on Amazon Prime.

B00BGIC170|3.0|Thought it would hilarious, but to close to real life.  Real conflicts.  Too long.  Few funny parts in the trailers, no great surprises.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Need inspiration to go practice your own instruments? Just listen to these guys for a few minutes, and, if you're anything like me, you'll be set to go. Their sound is rich and beautiful, their work is creative, and their song selection is SO MUCH FUN.
B005STGJPI|5.0|Dave Grohl just knows how to have fun and keep his fans rockin out. Skin & bones strips things down to their acoustic level but also adds something special to make these songs just as interesting as they are in their original electrified version. It some instances I'd be hard pressed to pick which version I enjoy more, but thanks to the Foos I can enjoy them both. Dave and the gang bring a great set list spanning their career up to this point to an enthusiastic appreciative roaring crowd... and the triangle solo is one not to be missed :) For any fan of the Foo Fighter, any fan of great rock n roll, and fan of great music, if you haven't already added this to your collection, have it order now and are patiently waiting for, then you're wasting your time reading this review because you could be purchasing this great album... and don't forget to buy the dvd.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Dubstep with a legit violin? Yes please!!!<br />I love when modern meets talent, and that's basically what Lindsey's work is. If you haven't seen her videos--go check them out!! I love how she dances.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I am very very sad that the series has ended now.  Love that I can watch the complete series here.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|The Piano Guys rock. They take beautiful, luscious-sounding instruments and use them in such a creative, original manner--absolutely fantastic. I've listened to several of the tracks over, and over, and over again, and when I don't feel like practicing my own instruments, I just have to listen to the Piano Guys for a few minutes and I'm ready to go!
B0076HNCTQ|4.0|Once you can keep track of all the characters and how they fit into the plot this series can become addictive. You keep asking &#34;what's going to happen next??&#34; And what happens next is never quite what you expected.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|story line is too disjointed.  difficult to folllow characters.  when author changed charactters in the story line it was necessary to read additional pages before it became clear which character and life he was following
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a beautiful story, with many layers of complexity.  It is a good story for people that appreciate the human condition and the ties that bind us.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|The 4th episode in the series had some apparent damage to the DVD and I could not watch it.  The rest were fine but I missed almost an hour of the action and have to try and figure out what happened by what their saying in later episodes.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|love it, love it, love it!  i am re-watching series, starting with season 1, episode 1.  can't wait for new episodes.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Liked the film, Gray is adorable there and Swayze is awesome.<br />Good music and dancing, an hour of pure pleasure.
1594746168|3.0|I was so incredibly stoked when I received The Resurrectionist - simply put, it is a beautiful and stunning book. The book is broken up into two sections - first, the  biography of the fictional anatomist, Dr. Spencer Black and second, a fictional Gray's Anatomy of sorts, filled with beautiful anatomical sketches of mythological creatures. The Codex Extinct Animalia speaks for itself - it is gorgeous. The sketches are professional and I was surprised by how accurate they were... well, as accurate as the skeletal structure of a harpy can be....<br /><br />However, the biography of Dr. Spencer Black is what makes me hesitate about The Resurrectionist. At first, it was what I expected of any story regarding an anatomist and surgeon of the 1800's - grave digging and primitive dissections included. As Black's story progresses, he becomes a specialist in physical deformities and begins to believe that humans must be distant relatives of long extinct mythological creatures (i.e., webbed fingers or toes indicate a historical relation to mermaids). And this is where the story gets iffy. Obviously, Black is disillusioned and his fantastical notions are impossible to back up via science... and, in a desperate attempt to validate his theory, Black turns to really dark experiments....... (dun, dun, duuuun!)<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this story was riveting... but it was also incredibly disturbing and pretty gory at some points. At times, I found myself physically cringing... and I don't typically get grossed out that easily. I think that if I read The Resurrectionist closer to Halloween, I would have appreciated it a lot more but for now, I found it pretty disturbing.<br /><br />If you're into dark story lines and can stomach some disturbing stuff, go ahead and pick up The Resurrectionist. I can guarantee that you will be blown away by the drawings. But, if you have a hard time stomaching gory images, I'd steer clear - this story probably won't sit well with you.<br /><br />This review was originally posted on my blog: www.acreads.blogspot.com.>This review was originally posted on my blog: www.acreads.blogspot.com.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Fine cast and much better writing than on the overrated Dowton Abbey. It's a pity there won't be a third season.
B00C7KXUOE|2.0|Hannibal has some useful dimensions. The Hannibal character is so well cast - Mads Mikkleson is brilliant, enigmatic, exotic and slightly creepy. However the other characters, including Will Graham just aren't that interesting or convincing. Also, the formula of the show is more along the lines of monster-of-the-week vs. a continuous story, which I always find less compelling. The show has some interesting stylistic elements but just doens't hit the mark - seems like a lost opportunity.<br /><br />Another gripe I have though is that the quality of video on Amazon &#34;HD&#34; instant video is terrible. I put &#34;HD&#34; in quotes because this is anything but HD - it feels like someone filmed it with a handheld video camera at the back of the theater.  I will NEVER purchase anyt Instant Video from Amazon again. They might argue - oh, maybe it's just the internet connection? Nope. I jump over to Netflix Instant Watch, and the quality on everything is very good to excellent. There is no comparison. I also made the mistake of downloading Vikings &#34;HD&#34; which is equally terrible video quality.<br /><br />I recommend just waiting for the show on Blu Ray or waiting for it to show up on Netflix Instant, which is a proper video experience.  The fact that Amazon thinks they can call something HD when it is far below even VHS quality is egregious. They should be ashamed..
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very addicting, I can spend hours with this app.  Very educating also would highly recommend for the children but fun for the adults also!
B00BLCHZC2|3.0|Vikings is a pretty neat show. I like that it's relatively simple and set at an unusual time in history. It's missing the layers of complexity you have with a show like Game of Thrones, but it is well worth a watch. The lead character is interesting in that he's relatively soft spoken and introverted - a good role model for a different brand of leader.<br /><br />One big gripe I have though is that the quality of video on Amazon &#34;HD&#34; instant video is terrible. I put &#34;HD&#34; in quotes because this is anything but HD - it feels like someone filmed it with a handheld video camera at the back of the theater.

B000JQU4TW|2.0|The poetic justice at the end was much required to redeem this book in my eyes. I understand the concept and where Wilde was going with this book, but it lacked drive. That is clearly my opinion, and with some more study on the book I might find different thoughts... But at this time, it's not my favorite of stories.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I have to say I love this book! I did end up watching the movie a few days after I read the book and the book wins my fab:)
B009NY43NY|4.0|Despite some of the poor reviews on here I decided to to read the final novel anyway.  I don't understand the poor reaction to the book.  It ended the way I predicted it would in the first few novels.  My only complaint is I thought it was reasonably shorter and had a little less suspense in it. Overall I was happy with the book though.
B006G35EEC|5.0|My four year old granddaughter watched this movie over and over during a current trip.  It kept her entertained during the long waits at the airport!
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|Same good old sound, maybe more like Jerry's solo stuff than AiC. Takes time to grow on you because it's a bit too cohesive, but compared to the s*** people pay for today this is solid gold.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I don't buy many movies, but this had to be one of them. I can watch this over and over there are so many details and great lines. They do a good job pulling the story line from all the proceding movis together and carrying it to the next step. The actors seem to be having fun and bring great personality to the characters, and there is so much action you almost don't know where to look. Watch it, puny god!
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|I read this book in the early '80. Purchased a Kindle copy and read it again from cover to cover.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is one of the few movies my teenager actually wanted to watch with me, and it has a great mother/daughter message. I liked the fact that there wasn't the typical girl/boy romance that you find in so many of the Disney movies, but was instead geared more towards self sufficiency and family loyalty. Very good movie for all ages, and they handle some delicate subjects remarkably well.
B00005R8GU|5.0|The true Father of Chicago/Delta Blues gone electric.<br />I really enjoy this album Good stuff for sure !!!<br />Keep'n The Blues Alive
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This was our Christmas present and we had so much fun Fun FUN putting it together. We took our time and had some play breaks and spent a solid week together working on this. The instructions are detailed and easy to follow, have a logical progression, layer by layer and room by room, so while challenging, it was not too hard. The pieces are grouped and labled for each step, and we opened and sorted them accordingly. There were a ton of mini figures, some unique to this set, and many details from the movies that really make this set shine! Love the working trash compactor! When complete the set is fairly heavy, but sturdily built and has so many different feature for hours of play time. Best set ever!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I loved the movie.. It has a good twist and let's your imagination run wild. I would recommend it to anyone
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|We loved this. Each day my son got to open a little toy that took him mere minutes to put together, and each day his stockpile of unique star wars minis grew. When combined with other Lego Star Wars sets, these added some nice new and fun items to increase the playability. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Looking forward to next year's Lego Advent Calendar.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Hansel and Gretel was decent. The story was good, but I did not like how they did not stick to a time period specific acting. Dropping of f-bombs and other cursing just takes away from the heart of the picture. There is one scene with partial nudity and alot of cursing.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I am not a prude, but this movie did not need those things. Had the movie been more like \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" I may have enjoyed it more. In my eyes, this film tries way to hard to be something it isn't.<br /><br />Final review. It is a good movie to rent but I would not waste my money on a purchase. The movie did not leave me wanting to watch it again. I mentioned \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" in my review and that movie I have seen more than a dozen times and I enjoy every time I watch it. This movie doesn't even come close to that.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|So it continues. I'll never forget the first time I heard Black Sabbath. I was with some friends who played drums and guitar like myself and one of their cousins came over with a copy of Paranoid and said the we had to hear it. All of us in the room were hooked from that time. I believe that this was in 1972 if I'm correct. I have every Sabbath album with Ozzy on it. The music from this version of Black Sabbath (the original version of the group), has always gripped me. So when I heard through Amazon that a new Sabbath Album was being released with the original line-up, I was anticipating greatness and quality just as they had delivered in the past. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />\\"13\\" is a far superior album of new material from Black Sabbath that far out shines any so called Heavy Music in both past and recent years. It seems like they just picked up from where they left off. All of the songs are superior in this musical genre that the band themselves singularly created. The album kicks you low in the gut as the bass enters and becomes energy within your body. Iommi's guitar is tasteful and classic (I remembered how I tried to copy every lick he played when I was younger). Ozzy's vocals sound as ghostly as ever and powerfully send the message of each song into your brain. The new drummer fills Bill Ward's shoes well with his steady solid rhythms and set a great rhythm section up with Geezer Butler's rhythmic bass dexterity.<br /><br />The message I want to send is that 13 brings those of us back to the enjoyment of the sound that created tons of music careers. Sabbath is as fresh today as they were back when their first self titled album appeared in the early seventies. What's more exciting is that a whole new generation of guitarists, bassists, drummers, and vocalists will be born from this record. I, will sit back, listen, learn those licks that Tommy is wailing on, and watch as the new generation begins.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is worth the money. You have stickers different backgrounds. You have so many colors to chose from and you can color with colored pencils, paint, markers, and craonys. My favirte part is that you can share it with your freinds or family. So you should absolutely get this app.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I wanted this to end! If it doesn't then I like the next book to be available now! I love Cross and Eva and I don't want to wait!!!!! Sylvia please be QUICK!!!!!
B007712XAU|3.0|The discs in season one had times when reception was scrambled and we had to skip to next scenes to continue.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I watched this show because it was recommended to me because I enjoyed White Collar.  The character interaction in Suits is very similar to that in White Collar, with witty sarcastic humor, good-cop bad-cop routines, and a plethora of inside jokes.  The plot line is gripping, and, though the cliffhangers at the end of each episode can seem tiresome, they do leave you wanting to see more.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is about of fun. When I  first played, i played for hours. I wished that once we dress the girl we could make her do things like dance...
B0002IQNAG|4.0|The European version was different pacing and was a quicker movie. The extended edition had a little more gore to it. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this purchase.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Immediately after I submitted my order, Season 3 appeared in my library.  It's fascinating.  I'm sure I'll watch it again.  It gives me greater understanding of World War II as the British experienced it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun game. Didn't last very long without buying . But fun. Needs more time to it by  I really enjoyed this one
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like this bible.  It is very easy to navigate. I look forward to using it in study and in services.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I loved this game at first but it's the same pattern, path, jumps just with a different scenery- Miami,Paris,Tokyo, etc etc.  No challenge just boring.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|My wife and children have been on me for years to get on facebook.  Finally, my daughters bought me a Kindle Fire for birthday/father's day gift and foirced me to join.  Once I learn how to really use it, I am sure I will love it.  I now get the same pictures of grand children that my wife has been talking abouit.
B00A2FSSHK|4.0|This movie reminds me of much of the political corruption that is going on today.  How we are losing so many of our FREEDOMS.  This is no longer a fantacy.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't know what to say! This book had me from the first page and I could not put it down. drew and Kate were hilarious , I couldn't get enough of the sarcasm and banter that they had. There was so much sexual tension between the two of them. I loved how one minute they hated each other and the next could not get enough of each other. I don't want to give anything away but this book is definitely worth it. It is funny sensual and sexy! Do not miss out on this read. you will not be sorry. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.
B0071MDA2U|2.0|I liked the characters and the overall plot.  I Hated the language and the moral situations.  I wouldn't recommend reading this book.  It was so awful, that I stopped reading in the middle of the story.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am a senior and being able my Bible with me always.It is perfect on my mobile and Kindle but I find it very hard to get in on the computer.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|i loved the play and i loved the music from the play so we bought this. the songs are entertaining and fun to sing along with
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is perfect for those who enjoy playing games.  I find it very rewarding in keeping me thinking and moving.
B00000F14B|5.0|this movie was very entertaining!!! i enjoyed watching it with my family and it is now one of our favorite movies!!
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|I don't think there is any reason to compare this score to the Williams iconic score.  Sure, its a hard thing to do but comparing this to something that has stood the  test of time and is instantly recognizable isn't truly fair.  This is a different movie...a different imagining of Superman.  I myself loved the soundtrack but I do have a question.  In the very first trailer we got a piece of music that unless I am deaf, isn't on this soundtrack.  Where is the 'Gladiator' sounding music...the woman singing from the very first trailer?  I LOVE that piece.  Am I deaf? (probably)<br /><br />*update*<br />OKay, so the music in question is called Ideal Of Hope and apparently not Hans Zimmer?  Correct or no?  I wish this was included on the soundtrack
B0001XAPY2|5.0|this movie was very entertaining!!! i enjoyed watching it with my family and it is now one of our favorite movies!!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I can't complain only because it was free. So hey it was free so with that being said it's okay
0307987647|5.0|A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two (Game of Thrones)<br />The Second Book in Game of Thrones is EXCELLENT.<br />The shipping and condition of the book  are rated a '5' for both.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|With the deprication of Google Reader, Feely seemed to be a dominant alternative in reviews/recommendations.  I'm still fairly new to Feedly, but have been using it on both a browser and my Kindle, and I'm very please.  It consumed my Reader account setting with no effort and I find the interface very nice.  After using a browser almost exclusively for my blog reading, I now find myself prefering the Kindle interface.  I liked the simplicity of the Google Reader and have found Feedly to be similarly simple , but the effort put into a &#34;pretty&#34; Feedly interface does enhance my user experience.  Also, I REALLY like the way Feedly incoporates services that require you to go to their site to read the entire post - rather than opening a separate browser application, it's all handled within the Feedly app.  LIKE.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|One Night Only is so good I had to buy another one for my collection, and with the group down to one it seemed like the thing to do
B006GLLXXK|5.0|Love it from the beginning, dark love story with magic thrown in.<br />I hope the saga continues on, all the characters are so believable.
B00AR1G3FS|4.0|Eagles are a group that have been around and like most bands have gone through changes and manage to keep the same quality in their music. I hope to see them this fall in Denver.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is very relaxing while simultaneously being challenging.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable storyline, graphics, and music. It is fun to move along the levels and this quell has the unique method of dusting pictures to get to the next level.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was required to read this book during the latter part of my sophomore year of high school in my English class. I'm never a fan of the books schools want their students to read nowadays, so when I was assigned this book, I was very excited. Tons of my friends had read it and said it was wonderful, and reading it for myself, I agree. It has such a great story line, and John Green really has a gift for writing.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next book.  Love Eva and Gideon's story.  I like how there are several different characters with drama going on but book 4 needs to come out soon.  Can't wait this long next time.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|I have seen Nemo several times and realized I wanted this DVD for my collection since it's a real classic.  I bought one for a gift as well; can't go wrong with the sweet humor of little Nemo trying to find his Dad.  Highly recommended.
B00AK57N00|3.0|IOS version runs without issue. This version doesn't remember audio settings once you leave the settings page (cannot mute bgm) and crashed the first time I played it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Was taken back to my preteen years totally caught<br /> in the fantasy /reality.  Realized I miss reading and really enjoyed getting lost in this book.  While it's for a younger audience in on my fifties and wanted to see what all the talk was about.  I can't believe some young children saw the movie or read the book as it's rather violent.  Well written and great read no matter how old you are.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent story line. Really enjoying the entire series. Great acting, realistic themes and stories in the court room, the office and of course in the lives of the players.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The entire series was a great fantasy story that felt as if it could be here on earth in the near future.  Graphic for really young readers.  Kept me interested and went from wanting to know why everyone was talking about it to having to see how it ended.  Great read even for us adults
B0053O89KG|5.0|The series continues to present episodes with a fast pace that catch your attention.  Can't waiting for the next season...
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I DO NOT like that the game has you purchase credits or coins. When I tried to back out of it, it will not let me play until I do....well...NO THANK YOU!!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great show! A whole lot better than that Game of Thorns mess. Where they just walk around and then kill people off because the stories are going no where!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app to check the local weather in the morning.  I usually take care of clients and have to dress them according to the weather.  Great!
B000274THQ|5.0|Goodbye Lenin! is such a gem. The soundtrack, crafted by Yann Tiersen of Amelie fame- is amazing. Daniel Brühl is precious. The film's messages about relationships between family and personal relationships with a country are so endearing. I think it belongs on a curriculum with documentaries about the Berlin wall. It provides such unique perspective in that historical & political context.
B005HSL626|4.0|I played this game while staying at a resort and loved it.  I was so excited when I found it was available on my phone.  Thanks
B0000A1WGH|5.0|As an avid fan of the film and of Yann Tiersen's work, this was an obvious addition to my collection, and I'm quite pleased. The digital copy was incredibly convenient because of Amazon's cloud.
B008220D5K|5.0|I saw this in the theatre and couldn't breathe from laughing so hard, couldn't wait to own it!  Dvd and case came fast and in perfect condition.
B00979CS50|2.0|I listened to it a couple of times. Usually some songs will grab my attention. Didn't happen this time. I have  been listening to Neil Young for more than 40 years. In recent years he has had some losers. This is one of them.
B00005R24K|1.0|The movie was in the case, the case however was some old monster plastic thing. Not good for a collection. Avoid this seller.Amazon was great however on refunding my money and I sent the product back.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Well balanced. Good amounts of fear, grittiness, gore, suspense and drama. Good production values too. From the sets to the wardrobe to the makeup. Love it.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|I was expecting a bunch of lag but have experienced none! The interface is also very easy to navigate. Great app
B00A861QMM|4.0|This game  will be too boring for kids as the story stretches out so far that your kindle will try to go to sleep.No kidding,my kindle kept fading out with so much dialog.Also ,it has to be the hardest hidden objects to find that I've ever played.Most objects are just peeking out or blurred so much that when you get a hint you'll be sitting there saying \\"nuh uh\\" because you still won't see it. I played to the end only because I'm not a quitter, but it's not one of g5's best for sure.If you like difficult and boring, this game's for you.Otherwise,if you need a nap this will surely put you right to sleep.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved the story!  Can't wait for the 4th.  Never going to read a review on a author or series I love!  It was awesome.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Such a beautiful film. I initially had no desire to watch it, but my wife insisted. By the end of it, I had tears in my eyes. Such a wonderful film that will make it's way to the library shortly.
B006VGGAC4|1.0|Not very well written. Interesting life but not a good read. I think it could have been a better read if the writing was better.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Funny show. Great jokes. Easy to get in to. Great time killer as well. What more do I need to say about it?
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I downloaded this app because i own a very simple &#34;small&#34; phone & the calculator is a pain. I do like this one &#34;huge buttons&#34;.
B0058BI896|5.0|Funny show. Great jokes. Easy to get in to. Great time killer as well. What more do I need to say about it?
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Please add more crashes to the app.<br />If you can't tell already i am being sarcastic. It is so frustrating to have this game crash on you.<br /><br />Fix this i will gladly rate you a 5 star
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Good. The end is the best part. Kind of boring the whole book. You will know who was the murder.
B001DPC4S2|5.0|Moondance is a truly great album. Showcases Morrison's talent in varied songs. Many are pleasantly recognizable. A must for your vinyl collection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is soo great I mean the best part was the proposal at the boat but not going to tell it Buy it what am I saying Buy All 3
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Where all the cables went, but SO glad that finding another one is this easy, and that it's adaptable to any USB port. I bought several back-ups, as these are just good cables to have on hand for those small Micro USB connections.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is quite good if you like a straightforwad escape game using tools and codes you find in the room. It wouldn't suit people who like all-singing-all-dancing games asit is simple in its presentation and play. However, I am quite enjoying playing it. My only gripe is that I was forced to write a review as it wouldn't allow me to progress beyond level 8 without doing so. This flaw needs to be fixed! People like to finish a game before rating it!
B002N1AF7C|4.0|Got this latest remaster of the pivotal masterpiece Autobahn by the pioneering German technocrats Kraftwerk (2009 for this edition, but you know there's one or two in the future coming down the pike), and it sounds fine and dandy. It really slights the fans though or any other curious listener dabbling in all that's available with its exclusion of liner notes that would have provided all that a remaster should have, and more. I personally would have greatly enjoyed some kind of band history and photographs to fill me in on what the band was all about around the time of the album's 1974 recording (a prolific year for many artists in other music genres across the board). What the purchaser gets here is a paper sleeve the CD jewel case slips into with a logo that must stand for an approaching overpass on the roadway the album is titled after (it's lifted off some of the album artwork in the literature). The case itself has the original artwork (thankfully) with a picture of the band members on its back. Inside below where the CD pops into is scant album information that mentions legendary studio man Konrad \\"Conny\\" Plank as the engineer of the proceedings. That's all and not much more. What could have been for this listener pining away for what was carelessy left out. At least there's the music.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I absolutely love every song on this CD! You are a &#34;Musical Genius&#34; Bruno! I look forward to more great music from you!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I really enjoyed watching 3 seasons of 'The Good Wife', now that I am sucked in i will be charged $1.99 per episode  to watch season 4 in addition to my 'Prime' membership.  Not too happy about that.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|There must exist a certain apprehension on some level to see a film that is both a remake, reboot, and didn't have enough push to grace many theaters. Should a person be willing to overlook their apprehensions however, they will find a movie that is able to completely justify it's existence, and impress even the most stone-hearted of viewers. The primary point of this film is the action, which can only be related to the first Die Hard. It's actually in the barest sense the same plot. Our hero is trapped inside a skyscraper, outnumbered desperately and must fight his way out. It could have been Christmas for all I know during the film, and they just don't celebrate it after the Apocalypse.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|The product was exactly as you stated it would be and it is a perfect fit for the Galaxy 4, thank you.
B005JABSB6|5.0|Very high quality active 3D viewing on my Sharp Aquos 80&#34;. Watched Avatar and felt like the real world doesn't look as good as this.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like this kind of stories, so I'm probably not to objective on it.<br />It's a typical alien invasion story-line with good effects and established characters.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|What a movie! I think this is a really well thought out sci-fi movie with suspended disbelief turning into a quizzical &#34;what if it's true&#34; kind of thing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an excellent read. I was initially just going to read the first one on a recommendation and couldn't quit. Thumbs up.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The best of his three novels - he transported me to Afghanistan and then onto Paris - wonderful!  Didn't want it to end!
1439156816|5.0|Who could write a negative review on a book by one of the most successful, prolific writers of our generation.  The dude is of course seriously messed up when it comes to story ideas, plots, characters and endings, but his approach to writing is completely professional.  Great insights for those who dream of writing but can only manage to read books on the subject, or write lame reviews, like this one.  Stop reading this and use the one-click order button and just maybe the spider won't lay eggs in your ear while you sleep.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|The visuals are cool, the 3D is a bit annoying.<br /><br />The acting isn't bad but the plot wasn't much to work with.
1451688091|4.0|I took three months to actually finish this book.  After I untangled the &#34;team&#34; it was easier.  She is a wonderful author!.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|This is a nice program to look at the sky and see space stations but I can't seem to find any planets. Planets are the reason I got the program in the first place. My friend has it on her phone and it is neat because she can look at it and it tells her what planet it it that we are looking at but not this one. All it tells me is what space station is above me and what the constellations are. Not helpful to me. No useful at all unless I am using it wrong. I will try using it again but I am not hopeful.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I saw the PBS concert and enjoyed it tremendously.  HAD TO HAVE THE CD for further enjoyment!  Who would have thought that some of the percussion is the cello player &#34;slapping&#34; his instrument.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|ive seen the movie and loved it. i ordered the movie from here...amazon. i started reading the book a few months ago, and i havent gotten that far. the wording is a bit involved and mature for someone who is not accustomed to reading, but the wording does stimulate a new way of looking at the fascinating details of the characters' lives. even if you don't finish the book, you need a classic piece in your book wardrobe.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Hate it!!! I thought it was a REAL game. I don't want no runner. I want a REAL game. HATE!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Like puzzles but don't like losing the pieces or can't find the room for them? Then this app is for you. Lots of choices and free puzzles. Play on the go. Smoothing background music. Different sizes as well. Suited for all ages in my opinion. Awesome way to unwind after a long day.

B00BI73CVI|2.0|I understand that there is supposed to be singing in a musical but every line is absurd and horrible. I read the book and that was good, this movie and Lincoln were the most overrated movies I have ever watched. Lincoln gets one star, it was even worse.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|pretty addictive and very very fun Sept it needs more sharks and should add dalphins or whales 2 play as as well
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Can there be too much of a good thing?  Yes:  Too many stars, too much money on cgi special effects and not enough on writing or acting.  Normally I enjoy many of these actors on their own terms, but thrown together in this millew they are all extraordinarily flat and dull.  The plot is predictable, the side kicks too gimmicky... I know it is a family movie, but that is no excuse for lazy acting or writing.
B009ZQP42E|5.0|I never knew there was a movie until all the publicity about the play. Lovely story, great music, wonderful actors.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is fun because it is based on Finding Nemo and has tons of things to add to &quot;reef&quot; and attract new fish.  Like other apps similar to this, it starts out with tons to do then becomes more and more limited as you progress.  I definitely envoy the brilliant graphics.  I don't feel compelled to spend my own money since you can earn &quot;pearls&quot; from the rare fish.  I do wish the rare plant seeds produced less repeat plants.  Thanks for sharing your reef Nemo!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|if you read the post end of the book, you will know what I mean.  I hope to see a 4th
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very fun and a great time waster. It is also free sk there is no harm in trying it out. Go get it right now!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Each book got better, nothing slow moving about this series.  Truly helped get me over the 1st one! Thank heavens!
B003H6KRIE|3.0|I think is a good edition and for this price...great!!! could put more extra things but is a acceptable edition.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You have to get through this one to understand him.  Parts weren't my fav, but overall good book to lay the foundation for trilogy
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Dave must be the most solid metal musician in the world, next to the mighty Lemmy from Motorhead. Megadeth's new album Super Collider has been receiving some very undeserved bad ink- this is an excellent, well-written metal album with some of the best riffs since The System Has Failed (itself a fantastic album.) I will say that Dave's voice has sounded better- I prefer his snotty, high-register bark to the vocal delivery on much of SC, but as some live footage has shown over the years, he is likely losing his upper register, a very common thing with singers of heavy bands. But Dave has been releasing quality, challenging material for 30 years, and here he is still on top of his game. Black Sabbath should be so \\"Lucky 13\\"- the new Sab slab is pretty flat and has little of the fire and swing that made them so monumentally influential. But that's for another review. Super Collider is no thrash masterpiece, but is what it is; another great MegaRecord- the writing is strong, the band is killer, the production is tight, and Dave even has some fun with some different instrumentation, and a great cover of an old Thin Lizzy classic- I enjoyed the whole album. And I don't see where people are saying there is a lack of guitar solos on here- WTF? Every song is a workout.    EDIT- now that I've had this album for a while, I've listened to it numerous times and can say that I feel it is a VERY strong record. The writing is well-paced and interesting, it's very heavy, and I don't hear any weak points. I think those who are dissing it are doing so due to short attention spans- if it takes some 'intent' to get into what a band is saying, then it's not worth the time for some- they want their faces ripped off for 50 minutes non-stop; not that there's anything wrong with that, but Dave has produced an excellent, thoughtful album that is FAR above comparisons to Risk. Compared to 90% of bands on the planet, it's probably worth more than my 4 stars, but after all, this IS Megadeth we'retalking about- it's not quite in the echelon of Rust In Peace, Youthanasia, or The System Has Failed, so 4 stars is as high as I can go. Love it!
B00D2ZF24O|5.0|I read so many negative reviews about this movie that I just had to see it, and I must say that I enjoyed it very much! I love the message about fear being a choice, the story about a father that knew his son so well (Despite not being around), that he could anticipate his moves, thoughts and feelings with incredible accuracy. That Will Smith could convey these feelings without much expression was something not many actors could do. I really felt his concern (to not say fear) at sending his son on a rescue mission that would either save or doom them.<br /><br />The ending where Kitai finds himself was fantastic and both Will & Jaden Smith did an excellent job. As regards the earth itself... is was beautiful (deadly, yes) but lovely. I was so happy to see so many creatures roaming the hills, mountains and oceans again. I would love to see that in the future (minus the trying to kill us all part!). Of course this is only my humble opinion, but I really enjoyed this film, and look forward to seeing it again and again.<br /><br />Cheers!
B001OHWDWG|5.0|here it is. not everything but, you really can't complain.<br />so much here. I took the time to date each song with the year it came out in my itunes catalog.
B00821OX98|4.0|We missed this when it first started and were bored one weekend so decided to check it out. After just 2 episodes we were hooked. We spent the next few days catching up so we'd be ready for the start of the new season. It is really addictive.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|great animation as always. enough humor and antics for the grownups to not get bored. plus just plain funny classic
B009X01FJS|5.0|The cover fits my Kindle Fire tablet perfectly and works just as advertised. I couldn't be more pleased with it.
B00C3UUZVE|3.0|My grandson loves these Dr. Panda games and I don't mind him playing since he gets a little math and reading skills while playing. These are really for preschool age kids - sometimes on my Kindle it's hard for him to choose as it won't pick-up his finger click on the screen and my 6-year old grandson is bored almost immediately.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|...that you will watch. Combining great dialogue and cinematic land/spacescapes this is one for the ages. Great characters and strong development of those characters help to push this above and beyond the typical TV show.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Great cast, horrible movie.  It is way to long, uninteresting plot(s), and the ending leaves you with a \\"wtf, I wasted 3 hours of my life for this?\\". Not worth it even if it is a free rental.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I was looking for a gigabit ethernet connection, via USB for my macbook pro. Apple only offers 100mb via USB, the ethernet option is through thunderbolt. I need both of my thunderbolt ports for VGA monitor adaptors. This product does exactly what I needed. It was tricky to get the drivers installed, I had to download them off the internet, and download a third party application that extracts .rar files. Once that was complete, I plugged it in and had an instant, fast connection.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|No matter how many times I see Goodfellas, I still am entertained like the first time.  It is a classic in my book.
B005544V6A|5.0|Fast paced, witty and smart. Very refreshing compared to a lot of the shows and series on TV these days.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Loved this movie.  Lots of plot twists kept you hooked the whole movie.  Can't believe I didn't see more hype about it when it was in the theaters.
0061127760|5.0|This is a wonderful edition of the classic &#34;Charlotte's Web&#34;. The information about the author in the afterword makes it well worth paying a little extra for this particular edition of the book.
B0076DELIG|1.0|I hate this book.  The book is hard to get through because it is so boring.  I will not be reading many of his books in the future.
1439181780|5.0|Great book ...Really helped me out when I was feeling down...Deff a different way to view the world ..............Thank you
B000NPF5ZC|4.0|When I received the Lp it was in great condition and played like a dream. Theres nothing like listening to KC on a record player
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i am 62 with poor vision so i very much appreciate the large bright layout. easy to see easy to use. doesnt get any better.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|Cover is nice, very elegant. No stands to put your Kindle up on a table but otherwise does the job in prootecting the Kindle.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|This wasn't as funny as I had anticipated, but was still worth watching. It had its moments, but was more dramatic than funny.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|This is the perfect Blu-ray to own. It it timeless and never fails to take your breath away. Buy it!
0307948560|1.0|I believe this might be a fun story for very young people who knows nothing. For a forty year old it is just sad. I just cannot stop thinking that if you are a smart mid thirties person you must have reached a higher lever of existence than this. This book is rubbish! Every \\"funny\\" and \\"smart\\" comment is an insult to a grown up woman. This book should be about a 25 year old woman, not 35.
0345529057|5.0|This was the best deal I had found for these books.  I started watching the show on HBO and ordered the books recently.  I am already on book 3 and I have to say the books are GREAT.  I love the show, but the books are even better!
B002KJX4IE|4.0|Beetlejuice is one of those old movies that is just fun to watch.  There are some movies that you watch and think &#34; That was an incredible moving Oscar winning movie&#34;.  There are some that you wonder why you bothered to sit through the entire movie.  Beetlejuice, doesn't qualify as an epic film, however, it fills that need to see a movie that is just fun to watch.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Totally worth the $2! Very engrossing and challenging. Sort of hard at first but you get the hang of it. Also beautiful graphics. Can't wait for the next one!
B005PK57IK|5.0|The show gets better as the seasons go on, would like to see more progression in the characters personal lives In the next season
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It would be cooler if I could search pages other than that it was okay with the same thing which means that I pretty much like the dictionary
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I got this for my Zoom H1 but I now have replaced it with a Rode Videomic. First thing you notice. THE 20FOOT CHORD. Jesus. It takes 15 minutes just to wrap it up. But besides that the audio is really just OK. Don't even think about just plugging it into your camera. AGC will kill the quality. Since the chord is so long it picks up every single little ant that walks on it. Plus you have no idea if it's actually on and working. As an experienced film maker I would highly recommend that all you &#34;DIY/Gorilla style&#34; film makers save up your money and invest only once in a great lav. But if you seriously have no mic at all and are low on cash, why not?
B003XVYLDU|2.0|Thought I would read a classic, wrong, back to reading my action/mystery novels. Bored me, \\" So it goes\\" AS mentioned through out the book.<br />Best thing was it was short, read it in a day.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great game. The only bad thing about it is I can't master it. But I love it. It's my favorite game
B0019I6WDG|5.0|I love this movie and recently rented it for my boyfriend to watch. It's a great story about being young, human, and having a family who really cares about you.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Slow start.  Then you get into it.  Then it has a slow end.<br /><br />There's some cool stories in there but also there's some boring ones.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|I bought this film for my dad for Father's Day because I wanted to share an extraordinary film on morals and parenting. Cinematically, the movie is very well done, but I have to give kudos to Dennis Lehane, the writer of the novel. After writing Mystic River and Shutter Island, we know this author is a genius!
B00422LESO|3.0|This book was fairly entertaining, but not overly exciting. If you don't have knowledge of Austen's work, you may find yourself confused. I'm looking forward to seeing this played out in movie version soon though.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This app is so fun, addicting and its just like OMG. (Oh my gosh)<br />I say get it. Even though it's .99 cents its still fun. By  if you wanna keep paying for more and more levels then don't be  it I was completely bumbed out when it asked me to pay for 10 more levels
0062014536|2.0|I was disappointed with this final book of the trilogy.  I think Lena's character fell flat.  Her relationship with Julian was blah.  Where's the love they are all fighting for?  Alex barely even said a word.  Oddly enough, Hana, who was cured, seemed full of passion.  I was more engaged with her story than the so-called heroine of the series.  Her perspective was fascinating from the beginning as she describes how the cure has affected her, how it does not work perfectly for everyone.  Her pair is such an egomaniac with control issues.  The line that struck me the most was his threat to Hana after she tells him \\"I'm your pair, not your dog.\\"  He responds \\"You're right, you aren't my dog.  But you will still learn to sit when I tell you.  You will still learn to obey.\\"  It shows that life is not perfect on either side of the fence.  Happiness sometimes does not turn out like we expect it to.  I thought the ending was premature; it could have used possibly two more chapters to give a sense of closure.  I felt cheated when Lena chose between Julian and Alex because there was no clear reason as to why she chose the one that she did.  I also was left unsatisfied when there was no mention of the bomb exploding in the end.  What?!  It builds up to that moment and then...fizzles.  It is in desperate need of some serious passion.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Was looking forward to getting the WOTE cd.This band is truly an innovative one and I love their Harmonies! I was not disappointed ! I would recommend this cd to anyone if you are a true music lover. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this cd because I went everywhere looking for it and no one was carrying it locally! Amazon is amazing! I am forever an Amazonian! I also use them for buying the latest DVDs.Never had a problem there either.The only thing I wish was different is that I get the newly released DVDs days after they have already been made available in retail stores.Seems like y'all could figure out a way for us to get the DVDs the same or very next day they are released to the public without me having to spend a fortune on express type shipping.If a person can go to a store like Walmart and Target and pick up the movie the day it is out couldn't Amazon make an arrangement to have it out to us that quick? Just sayin....
0805047905|5.0|This book is a classic!  What a fun way to learn your colors at a young age! Beautiful, bright illustrations.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|More than just guns, this book gives an insight into the heart and mind of an American hero - and his wife, who has also written sections of this book.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Ben Affleck did a excellent  job of directing and I found this movie to be very interesting.<br />All the actors played their parts so well.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I really liked this game, i like puzzle games and i like dungeon crawlers. this is a good mix of both. I played through the game twice, but only because i like match 3 games. I do wish that there was more after you reach your goal. or maybe when you leave the dungeon you can run outside or something like that. anyways very well made, i really liked the music too. I would and have recommended this game to other people.
B000MV90B2|3.0|This is an O.K. film for the historical information but a poor quality film to watch.  There must be some film out there with a better quality.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I love it I have lots of apps like this but not one that dose this good of a job I love this app
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I looked at the programs that were on my phone but could not create a playlist(s).  I like that I can purchase and also store to the cloud.  I would highly recommend.  Simple to use
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I first heard one track from this CD on the radio and liked it enough to look for it on Amazon.  This group is very clever and quirky and I enjoyed their music very much.  I only gave this 4 stars as it may not be the kind of music for everyone, but it suited me and I have played it several times now and the more I play it the more I like it.........Sophia
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Wow.  I've been searching and searching for a good game app and so far this exceeds my expectations. I know a lot of folks get upset over having to pay for a game after the free part is over but I appreciate it - I'd rather try it out and then if it's good I don't mind paying a few bucks for it.  Works great on K Fire no glitches so far. graphics are good and the puzzles are more unique than I've ever seen (process a picture for analysis; dust it-photograph it) so I happily give 5 stars so far and have already paid for the full app. Very well done great graphics. I'm going to look for all of their games.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Could hardy put the book down. Always well done just like all the other novels by Flynn.  I can't wait for the next one.
B007VPLNGW|4.0|I tried this out and it's a pretty good game but can be hard for a 5 year old to<br />get to higher levels.
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|Oz the great and powerful is a movie about a small-time magician (Franco) being swept away to an enchanted land and is forced into a power struggle between three witches as sort of a prequel to the Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />I found this to be an interesting story that added to the classic Wizard of Oz without messing with the original.  Colorful special effects although at times they seemed a bit to cartoony and green screen-ish.  The story line was good although I thought a bit slow especially at the beginning.<br /><br />Although James Franco does an ok job as the wizard but is it just me or do you think like I do that Johnny Depp, who is known for playing quirky characters, would have brought more to the role and been a better fit?  As I watched the movie, I just wondered what could have been if Depp had played the character in his own whimsical way.  Maybe Disney thought he was in too many of their movies or something but imagine what it could have been.  No matter how hard the wizard tried to make me believe in him, I just couldn't without seeing Depp in the role.<br /><br />Oz is not a bad movie, just not great as it could have been.  It is a good movie for the family of all ages to watch though and has something to entertain everyone.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|I got this for  a 5 year old, he does pretty well with it, but<br />it's not his favorite game. He loves subway surfer.
B00AEFXZNU|4.0|This is a remake of the original obviously. Fresher characters, pretty good dancing, upbeat music. A few scenes they played homage to the original - some dance steps and some dialog being the same. We bought both versions at the same time and had a mini-marathon. I still prefer the original movie though. Overall entertaining.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Suspicion, hostility, acceptance all mitigated by the main characters relationship to one great lady and her family.  In the final analysis justice prevails.
