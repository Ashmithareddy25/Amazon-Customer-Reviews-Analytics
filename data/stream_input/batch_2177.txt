0811879542|5.0|Creative book for children and enjoyed by two 4 year olds and even a two year old! Imaginative and colorful.
B008M7BQHE|4.0|The show kept the drama and sci-fi nicely tuned and present. I hope with stays grounded in its roots though (X-File's type show vs. Stargate SG-1) Can't wait to see what happens with Peter!!!
B005LAII8A|3.0|This kept going back and forth, past to future and could get confusing if you weren't paying total attention. It reminded me of something I've seen before, but frankly I don't remember what other movie it was. The ending was better than expected. I frequently lost attention so I kept reversing to catch what I missed. It has action and keeps moving forward, but it wasn't something I would want to watch again. It was ok. I think others would enjoy this and it's not bad. Some things could have been explained better, but that's just my opinion.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I thought this one to be the best of the four.  Have recommended it to friends.  Always a twist at the end!
B004KRWQLU|3.0|I hate it when an album is converted to MP3 and songs are shortened from the original. Unfortunately this is done here taking away from a classic album.
B00AF6B2BK|5.0|Fantastic album. Working on all 8 re-released picture disks. Had to wait on the pre-sale and release date but worth it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book very quickly because it was so engaging and I wanted to know what happened next. It was a very interesting plot. However, I thought the ending was horrible. I felt very left down by the way it ended.
B003097ABA|4.0|I have the 1st two albums on disk, was looking to buy just &#34;heartbeat city&#34; and came across this package for a cheap price and get 5 disks in all. Nothing spectacular about the packaging, just 5 disks. However, I'm just interested in the music and worth the purchase.<br />Shipping came quick and the price was right. Thank you very much.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I wish I had got mp3 when it first came out!  Bruno Mars downloaded album, \\"Unorthodox Jukebox, is beyond awesome. Bruno does it again and amazon makes it easy to afford.  I purchased it when amazon dropped the price to $1.99.  Great stealer deal!
B004EPYZPI|5.0|In my humble oppinion, it might be the best performance of Mattew McConaughey that I have seen. The movie is exiting and keeps you interested. I don't usually like attorney/criminal movies but this one cought my attention so much I wanted on my collection.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is just like the ones at the fair except with more bonuses and prizes.  Will keep you entertained for hours.
B001HZK8FY|5.0|My girlfriend loves this movie and this gift set as a very good gift. She loved it! And I got to admit that the packaging and the extra stuff on it is pretty much in pair with the collector's edition of any other movie I owe.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|lost is both the best show and the ruiner of my life<br /><br />cant listen to the soundtrack without weeping lol
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Delicious to look at, I enjoyed Season 3 quite a bit.  I felt a little off when I watched the first episode, like I had missed some material since the end of S2, but still enjoyable.  The last episode was a bit off, it fell into the category of day time soap opera sometimes.  We'll see how the cliff hanger turns out next season I guess!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I cant tell you how many game apps I tire of after a few plays and delete. this one is a keeper!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent acting, riveting storyline and true. What more could you ask for? I would recommend this film to anyone of age.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i have to admit that at first i was getting really frustrated at the game but after i got used to it i really liked the game and the graphics are alot better
B0044C3RB4|5.0|the whole series is awesome loved it the suspense and it always leaves you wanting more. something I'll watch again
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It is fast-paced with likeable characters and an interesting world. However, everything happens much too fast and the development of the story feels a little juvenile. I have read the second volume and may read more, but this will not be a classic. An enjoyable but light read.
B00821OX98|5.0|I was skeptical at first but after getting over the initial &#34;bug&#34; reaction, I couldn't stop watching this series. Sadly I've finished all that are available but have read that another season should be coming out this summer. Can't wait!  This one is something the whole family can watch, with the exception of pre-school and under because it might be frightening for them.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Everyone is familiar with the film. If you aren't, just watch it. There are plenty of great reviews here already. You don't need mine to convince you.<br /><br />The one thing I would like to say is that when I saw it in the theater on opening night and after he built the baseball field, he started hearing voices again, I said, &#34;What, do they want him to build a football field now?&#34; And then Amy Madigan's character said the same thing. I know that wasn't that surprising, but I still thought I'd mention it.<br /><br />Great flick, like I said in my title.
B004BSFC46|4.0|These little things does the job as it states and does what I need it to do, buy me time with the kid.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Half of the suspense was the fabricated departure. The Town was much better movie over all. Why are four more words required?
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows right now. It makes you think but it doesnt leave you confused or lost. I love how complex and interesting it is, it lets you get wrapped up in their world and invests you in the characters. I highly recommend this show to anyone.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The plot and new character were not developed as well as in the previous Bourne fills. The timing of the film was not as good.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This was such a funny movie.  The whole family loved it.  While it seemed to be a kids movie, the adult humor was really appreciated.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I can't think of a single thing he has written that I haven't liked.  The camel club books were my favorites, but this is good also.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Well done.  Interesting to watch, and a good modernization of some classic tales.  My husband and I enjoyed watching it!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|This is a book that everyone can enjoy and LEARN from.  Moran dispels many outdated notions and stereotypes of feminism, while providing a new feminist lens to understand today's generation of women and the experiences we face.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I don't have a lot of time to read so I found it difficult to get started. Once I did I couldn't put it down! At times it was too reminiscent of 'Sleeping with the Enemy' but I love how it kept me hooked and especially how it ends. Highly recommended!!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Songs are meaningful and fresh, imho. Fine music. At age 60 i have begun appreciating new artists in general. I add Alabama Shakes to Mumford and Sons, FUN, and Jason Maez's LOVE is a Four Letter Word album.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Dropped the core temp by five degrees C. Heat becomes much more manageable and this product delivers as it says!
B00009AOBI|5.0|My wife's been bugging me about this movie for years I never thought of looking for it till I thought of amazon  so my wife is happy she got her movie. Thanks amazon
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Me and my girlfriend were lost and confused for about the first half of the movie, and that's a good thing.  Unpredictable, and more turns than any road in Germany, Skyfall will not disappoint!

B002ZG999U|5.0|Even though I am a grandmother to six, I love action films.  This one has some of the &#34;old-timers&#34; in it.  Loved the movie and it was nice to see some of the actors again.  It was a very fair price.  It came as I was told it would and the packaging was very secure.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|My grandson and I went to see this movie at the local theater.  I thought I might like it because Jeremy Renner was one of the characters in one of my favorite movies of 2012 &#34;The Avengers&#34;.  I loved it and so did my grandson.  The action was non-stop and the picture quality and sound was very good.  The price was very comparable to local retail outlets, but Amazon made it easy for me to get the movie without having to brave the cold weather and it was free shipping.  Received just as I was told and packaged securely.  I haven't watched the &#34;Matt Damon&#34; movies, but I think this movie will encourage me to watch them.

B005LAJ212|5.0|Wow, love this drama and how great it is to see all the episodes with no commercials.  Can't wait to purchase the second season as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of thinking involved on some levels.  Love to play it, great mind teaser.  Fun no matter what age you are.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Natalie Portman and Ashton Kucher have great chemistry.  Natalie's girl buddies, and Ashton's guy buddies help keep the comedy flowing.  It's without a doubt in my top 10 of romantic comedies.
0345535421|4.0|If you are reading reviews for book two of the GoT series, it is safe to assume you have already read book one and as such are familiar with the general style and tone of the stories.  Therefore, I'm reviewing Clash of Kings in terms of the pros and cons and I see them.<br />The pros:<br />1. The return and \\"conservation\\" of many likeable characters from book one.  I make a point to say \\"conservation\\" because according to the reviews of the future books, Martin starts killing everyone off like fruit flies so I'm appreciating their roles in this book as a bonus.  Cersei and Tyrion are particular favorites.  One is an evil temptress who limits her sexual exploits to her immediate family and kills people like picking lint off a sweater and the other is a ridiculously intelligent dwarf who is both manipulative and lascivious but somehow equally endearing.  In both cases I'm like, I want to meet you, have a cocktail with you, and get inside your twisted head.<br />2. The writing invokes an emotional response.  I was physically tense at many points throughout the story because Martin does an amazing job of building towards a climax (unfortunately, this is also one of the cons because with so many plots unfolding at once the building progression occurs at a glacial pace).<br />3. Ease of reading - If you can get past the fact that there are literally hundreds of characters to keep straight, book two is similar to book one in that the style of writing is very easy on the reader.  I very rarely had to back track with each time I picked up the book and every time I would read it, I would read 50-100 pages in one go.<br />Now for the cons:<br />1. Like I mentioned earlier, the plot progression is extremely slow. These books are a conundrum to me because after reading each one (and to be fair I've only completed two so far), I feel like I have run five marathons but really only moved a single city block.  Don't get me wrong, between Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings I have been wildly entertained but the stories themselves are like the Bagger 288; massive machines with countless moving parts that move with tremendous momentum but very little speed (Note: I fully Googled \\"giant machines\\" to make that simile work).<br />2. Excessive details - I attribute much of the slow plot progression to the copious and extraneous details Martin includes at frequent and unnecessary points in the story.  For example, he seems to have an obsession with describing multi-course meals.  At times I felt like I was reading a cookbook for the medieval epicurean.  I don't care if someone ate suckling pig loins with a side of fig-flavored pigeon turds GET BACK TO THE STORY.<br />3. Increasingly depressing storyline.  Again, from what I gather from reviews of future books, life gets pretty dismal for the people of Westeros and I can see where this starts to happen in book 2.  I don't mind a bit of sadness and disappointment here and there but there were a couple of times when I had to put the book down because I was getting outright depressed.  My quiver of excuses to drink wine is already bursting with strain...I don't need to add more thank you very much.<br />All in all I did enjoy this book and I do recommend it to anyone who has read and enjoyed Game of Thrones.  To anyone who is thinking of taking up the series from the start, I can't say enough that if you have a kindle, read the books on a kindle.  The ability to look up characters is crucial to keeping everyone straight and the novelty of sparing yourself the weight of a 1,000+ page book is priceless.  The series is not for the faint of heart.  Nevertheless, having completed the first two books and making way well into the third, I can confidently say they are worth the effort.n wildly entertained but the stories themselves are like the Bagger 288; massive machines with countless moving parts that move with tremendous momentum but very little speed (Note: I fully Googled \\"giant machines\\" to make that simile work).<br />2.

B000FC1MM8|4.0|Another thriller by Michael Connelly. You have got to love Harry! Very intriguing and suspensful- a very enjoyable and fast read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Simple to use. Gives you daily and weekly information. Includes a radar. Dont have to spend a lot of time to get what you want.
B00881VLCE|4.0|If I have some extra time on my hands, I can relax by playing magic puzzles and there are quite a few free options as well!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The book is really thick. When reading it on the Kindle you dont get overwhelmed by the size! Very interesting book. It seems like so many books are the same story line. This one gives you something new!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|We got this for our book club.  Overall, we did not find it a good read.  It was hard to get into and then the plot got cumbersome.  However, the ending was quite a surprise.
B00821OX98|4.0|This show suffers from the perceptions by some folks that it is just a human vs alien action series. The best part of the show is the interaction between characters as they deal with the loss of their families and their old lives, their fear of what is yet to come, their determination not to give up, and how they live life when every day may be their last. And, oh yeah, there are also scary looking aliens, robot killing machines, captured and enslaved children, and lots of shootouts between the humans and the invaders.<br /><br />It's similar to The Walking Dead - which I also like - but better.
B001XULSG6|5.0|I am a Trekkie.<br />My wife is a Trekkie.<br />This was an excellent movie.<br />No brainier, 5 Stars.<br />You will enjoy.
B00821OX98|5.0|Loved the show! Acting was much better than Revolution and the special effects from the battles between Mechs and Humans were intense. Finished this season in less than a week and immediately moved on to season 2. It's that good!
B007JZGIMS|5.0|I have the Rocket premium, and the insyncr wireless. As good as music syncing gets with google/android, which is no where as good as it is with itunes, the issue is how well does the player play. And that is where the fail is for me. On my Samsung gs2, with all phone software up to latest versions, the player will start 'stuttering' the music. This happens within a song and a half and continues on. The only way to stop it is to quickly hit the power button to 'wake up' the phone, but within a couple minutes it is back to the stuttering. The people that sell this have been responsive, have sent me a beta program to try, and at this point we have exhausted all efforts, other than saying they are rewriting a new program. Since the music cannot be listened to with this problem, for the time being I am out $4 and the Rocket is unusable.<br /><br />****update 3/20/2013 After a beta download, and two other updates this player finally works. Upgraded from one star because it was unusable before, it now finally works without issue on my samsung GS2. Frustrating journey, but now highly recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game and playing it on my Kindle instead of my phone is a plus. Great quality and doesn't freeze like it does on other devices.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|get the message NO INTERNET CONNECTION... I paid for a lot of angry bird apps my grandson has played them constantly and loves him while in KIDS PLACE which blocks your child from the Internet and costly items they might click on or unwanted ads .KIds place has been a safe.place to have as you can play your games without worry...What happened to my paid ANGRY BIRD GAMES??? Now he can play all his other games just fine. I hope it gets fixed. My grandson is really upset!!!! BRING BACK OUR ANGRY BIRDS IN KIDS PLACE!!!!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Glad I downloaded this because it is much easier to read and figure out than it is on my phone. Great!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I went through the Star Wars Angry Bird games pretty quick, they are fun to play and recommend them if you enjoy any and all of the Angry Bird games available.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|These guys are great!  I started listening to each song thinking I would buy individual ones.  Then I gave up, they were all good - I could not decide which one I loved best, so I bought the entire CD.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|there is nothing especially incredible about it but it is entertaining enough when you do not have anything better to do
B008OOYALE|4.0|It's a fun game, it's really lovely to see the dragons evolve. Need better ways to earn gold & coins.
B0095R64AO|3.0|was really drawn out and slow at points. some of the jokes were not funny at all, but over all kinda fun.
B00004Y87O|5.0|Once again a movie that became a straight to video cult classic but the special effects and soundtrack by John Carpenter as well as the stellar cast made this a great Action Movie.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|its always awesome to see a bunch of veteran action actors in one movie! great inside jokes and cameros! def worth a watch or 2.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Best non- connery bond. Period! There is no way I would suggest any other recent Bond movie over this one.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|it was great seeing dracula being a typical worrisome father. it was a bit fast paced in the begining, but had a great ending. cute jokes too! great for kids and adults.
B005JE7XW0|4.0|Not too stupid, humor is not &#34;child funny&#34;, but simply funny. Actors do the play, not just make faces as in many modern movies.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Very entertaining movie.  Falls into cliches at some points, and doesn't really live up to the hype, but all in all worth watching.
B000BYA5GE|4.0|recently saw this movie on tv missed some parts of it so i bought it on here. it was priced great and the movie is good too
B00992CF6W|4.0|It has only a certain amount of blocks of different kinds. You can get more on the Pc version. But it is still a good version of minecraft
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't wait for season 3 to be available to prime members. Seasons 1 & 2 were fabulous!  Historical fiction at it's best.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|Characters needed more development.  If I hadn't of read the Mistborn series I would have been TOTALLY lost and put the book down in the first chapter.  It did get better as the book progressed.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Love me a great suspense and action book and this was it.  It was my first book in the series and the way every chapter ends just made read and read non stop.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Four different choosings with a large variety of challenges. Not a game  that can be completed quickly. It will keep you entertained.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this album. It is a great album and an excellent value! Many of the songs on Californai 37 are very popular, and for good reason.
B0089XH38M|5.0|AVG is by far the best free antivirus software!  It's easy to use, and works so well for  the computer, tablet and smartphone.  A definite must for your device!
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|THE MORE YOU PLAY THIS THIS GREAT CD, THE MORE YOU'LL ENJOY IT  NOT A BAD SONG ON THE CD.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had a hard time with the first book just dealing with the concept, but all 3 books very believable, the plot kept me on edge.  A great read!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|EL James is a grand write but would she try something else, with a lot less sex....I am not a prude , just don't need that much of it. I will not  be read this series but looking forward to anything else ms. James, you have the gift for writing!!
B00B9366VO|4.0|Dave Grohl made a great movie, It was very interesting to realize all the great music that was made there.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|well done Suzanne , now reading your Underland series.. you are a good writer, keep up the good works.  thanks for the books!
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's  beautiful novel, Pride & Prejudice. With a nearly six hour run time, the story has plenty of time to develop, and is easy to follow, whether you've read the book or not; you really seem to know and understand the characters.<br /><br />The casting is superb; the actors played their parts to perfection. Jennifer Ehle  plays the lively, arch character of Elizabeth Bennet- perfect. Colin Firth as the serious, wealthy Mr. Darcy is also well done. All other characters are also  well cast, Allison Steadman is hilarious- \\"No one knows what I suffer with my nerves!\\".<br /><br />The scenery, music, costumes, script - all nicely done. This film is a treasure, and fun to watch anytime!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A frank treatment of a terrible disease.  The beautiful language used to describe the characters, their thoughts and their world was mesmerizing.
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|This season steps away from the norm for Enterprise and basically becomes a life or death battle each episode. This is not new to Enterprise, but this season pushes it too far. I mean how many times can the crew be genetically altered, imprisoned, lost in time, mortally wounded, ... yet still pull through and go on happily trotting through a place that is so many times more powerful then they are? Too many in this season. But aside from the unbelievable aspects of the season, I did enjoy it and so I continued on to Season 4.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I've only recently been introduced to this writer, and have added his books to my Kindle. Just in the process of finishing The Snowman, and it's great.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book, kinda guessed the outcome. Felt it could have used a lead in for another trilogy but overall would recommec.
B00127RAJY|5.0|AS 50 yo people, this is  pretty hard,  although I have always said who needs a gym, I have rock climbed and lifted weights,  played soccer, baseball, conditioning in both,,  but as time goes on,  and work load picks up, who has time,<br /><br />so two 50 yo ( wife and I )  are trying this,  I would first check to see what your heart rate during exercise should be, because you are constantly moving for 20 minutes, I would watch Anita,  she does the less impact while the other gal Natalie goes through the tough part.  Jillian  walks around,<br />I wish she would do the do' s and dont's on the very first set, holding back straight,  dont over extend the knee etc.. although I know all of it,  others might not,  also for a 50 year old I found the pace a bit fast and wished it would go to 30 minutes, I have a finger O2 and pulse checker and used it a couple of times and was sure it was too hight, esp with the BP pills I take,  I am sure if continued it would get easier.<br /><br />all and all a cheap and good dvd for under 10 bucks.  watched level 2 and it is quite a bit harder.  have not watched the third level yet.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watched it over a couple of days with the wife. It just sucks you right in. Can't wait to watch season 3.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great writing and a plot that leaves you wondering who did it till the end. Interesting characters.<br />Fast read and hard to put down
B0076DELIG|4.0|I like Michael Connelly's stuff as a rule.  I think I have read them all and enjoyed them immensely.  I have grown old with Harry Bosch.  Now comes this book.  It seem to me as a fan, that he struggled with the story and many times sort of jumped around with characters and the action.  I was in law enforcement a long time and can relate to his &#34;issues&#34; with command although his issues are usually a bit far fetched.  He went way overboard on this story, going off on his own and trespassing with impunity and using police techniques that just don't exist anymore, if ever. It just did not make it with me.<br /><br />Frustrating to write this as I can't seem to find the words I want to use. I will leave it with the notion that is was hard to read and perhaps it's time to retire Bosch. I won't fight my way through another one of these.
B001LX2J22|4.0|It's a pretty good thriller. It's unfortunate that Anthony Hopkins isn't in it more. I highly recommend it for people who like Silence of the Lambs.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Video start page did not work at all!  Can take a photo on camera but camcorder/video did not even open to the start page.  Just indicated &#34;camera stopped.&#34; Camera option is the same as you can get on original Kindle app.  I bought this for $1.99 and was totally disgusted.  I am tech savvy and tried uninstalling, etc.  DO NOT BUY!  Amazon should review this item and REMOVE it from Appstore.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|If you like punk rock, you'll like this album. Straightforward, fast, typical Bad Religion lyrical content. It's a bunch of fast-paced, no bullshit Bad Religion songs. Buy this album...or don't. I don't really care. I have it and I love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This tale of teenage love was not for me.  But there was just enough &#34;umph&#34; to keep me interested to finish out the book.  I may simply be too old for this writer's audience.

B00AQB2A3I|5.0|The hardest working man in Prog has produced another masterpiece.<br /><br />Only 18 months after releasing the excellent \\"Grace For Drowning\\" Steven Wilson as raised the bar with \\"The Raven That Refused To Sing.\\" And once again Wilson invites the listener into a total sensory experience.<br /><br />Wilson remembers the day before digital downloads when purchasing an album was an event. You would take the time and go to a store and browse the isles. When you got home with your purchase and ripped off the cellophane the first thing that hit you was the small of vinyl and printers ink on paper. It was a great smell. Then you marveled at the large artwork and gatefold layout. You read all the liner notes and then immersed yourself in the music.<br /><br />Wilson lets you have a choice of formats. As for me, I received the deluxe edition with the 128 page hardback book and 4 CD's. And once again the smell of ink on paper was a joy as I viewed the excellent artwork by Hajo Mueller, which serves as another level of interpretation to the ghost stories that make up this concept work.<br /><br />And the music?  Stunning. He further develops the sound he explored on \\"Grace For Drowning\\" . A departure from his first solo effort \\"Insurgentes\\" which had more to do with his thinking at the time and a Porcupine Tree holdover. I so like his move away form that minimalist, droning sound to a more fully orchestrated instrumental affair with a touch of jazz fusion to boot.<br /><br />All the recent flourishes are found here. A touch of early King Crimson, some recent Steve Hackett and it sounds like Wilson has been listening to his KScope label mates--North Atlantic Oscillation. Especially on the title track.<br /><br />And that title track is truly amazing. It starts with just four notes on the piano. Wilson does a Thom Yorke vocal at the beginning before it gets an effects treatment, done a few subtle times on the album. Then themes are built and expanded. Instruments and dynamics layered until at the end you are left with a feeling of being lifted off the ground.<br /><br />Steven Wilson is the best hope for Progressive music. A man who honors the past but has his feet firmly planted in the here and now. A true artist in every way.<br />--
B009FZHYKU|5.0|by far the best show on TV! they have really stepped up the action in season 3. can't get enough of The Walking Dead!
B00A1U2SVS|3.0|I've been a Zepplin fan since day one and love nearly every cut they've recorded. I had high expectations for this concert with advanced reservations since I know they've aged and have to make compromises. Maybe this is my failure since so many enjoy this album. I'll have to give it some more time and look at it with my older perspective just as they interpreted their music for this occasion.
B00846REIS|5.0|I bought this book looking for something to follow reading the Fifty Shades Trilogy.  At first I thought this had nothing on that series, was I WRONG! I read it through so fast the first time being very judgmental when comparing the two books to those of FS.  Then I carefully read through the two Crossfire novels more carefully and realized that Slyvia Day's characters are richly written and so well developed that I almost forget that I reading a novel and not privately peeking into someone's diary.  I often find myself wishing Eva and Gideon will some how get over their pasts and see the depth of feeling they have for each other instead of the fear that seems to control them.<br /><br />These are raw novels that evoke a certain desire to face what ever demons someone may have to face.  They are encouraging and frustrating at the same time.  Ms. Day has a keen sense of what to write to draw a reader into the story and make someone wish the best for these characters.  Even the &#34;catty&#34; secondary characters add a richness to these novels.  Do not skip the erotic parts either or you could miss the true depth of feeling these two main characters have for each other.<br /><br />I still love my Fifty Shades Trilogy, but cannot wait to see what the new Crossfire novel will bring when released in May.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game got way too much hype, and I expected a lot more from it. Th graphics are good and the controls are slick, but the gameplay was far less than I had hoped for. It's not bad, but don't get your hopes up either.
B000HZGNDG|5.0|I enjoyed the amazing quality of this streaming.  I've always enjoyed this movie and it is critical that the sound and video come through.  Amazon's product is excellent and I would recommend it to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Clever logic game. It has all sorts of difficulty levels, and is a good brain teaser for when you have a few minutes to waste.
B009GE9Y44|5.0|I give this five stars as it's a step up from the last one in animation and great enjoyment and escape. I've enjoyed the live-action movies despite the bad reviews and this one should be one RE fans also enjoy and should watch. For those that don't like the movies, it's an escape, nothing more, nothing less and why I chuckle at reviews that knock the movies. In essence if you're looking for an escape and movie to enjoy w/out having to think, this is a great pick for any video game fan or horror fans.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this for EVERYTHING!!!<br />My Business notes, grocery list, to do list, etc....<br />Thank you for the great app :)

B009B2U73I|5.0|I'm a big Diana Krall fan and you would think she phoned this one in based on other reviews here. After listening several times over the last 3 months, I have to say that this is probably my favorite Diana Krall album. I'm also a huge T-Bone Burnett fan and with him producing, I think they captured a fantastically \\"real\\" sound. I do think the song choices here are a bit different than her previous fare but they really aren't that dramatically different in tone. I think they are all winners myself. Marc Ribot's guitar playing on the title track alone is worth the price of this album. :)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Fun game. love the upgrade from TR 1. Just to repeat others kindle fire seems to crash and not open. Hope it gets fixed
B009GEFXLC|4.0|This show is awesome and was available to watch as soon as the purchase was complete which is convenient. Only thing I can say bad about it on here and is the reason it is only get 4 stars is this: Amazon instant froze on me several times while watching a single episode and it has done the same thing to me in the past on other shows.<br />I suggest buying the season of Castle for sure but maybe you might want to buy it elsewhere so it won't freeze like it is buffering all the time.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|This app I bought because I couldn't get the instagram app,works good. Never used instagram so I don't know what I'm missing<br />Purchased the upgraded version because it was a good app

0545265355|3.0|I really love the first book in the series. The second book is alright and the third book... Well, I was so bored by the end of the second book I kinda gave up on even starting the third. What a disappointment.
B00004W221|5.0|Very inspirational movie. Have enjoyed watching it multiple times. One of the few movies that brings me to tears at the end, but not tears of sorrow.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Beautiful and fairytalish. Color and music and just the acting made me so e entranced.  Of course Kidman is just beautiful and glamorous.  The little bits of humor add so much to this drama
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Good movie showing the danger of alcohol. Not an uplifting movie, however. The in-flight action sequences were very good, but could have been a larger portion of the movie.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|tragic but so beautifully done. from the artwork to the makeup.  even just the city life photography.  it earned every award it got plus more.
B001H1UQRI|5.0|I like it because of the higher knowledge. It is a great movie I recommend it to everyone who likes a action movie
1616550414|5.0|A lot of people have said that the corners can get screwed up because of the poor packaging, and while that is true, I guess I was lucky. It is a nice book filed with alot of zelda stuff, mostly skyward sword, so keep that in mind, but overall it is a great read and a must have for all zelda fans.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It's great to go back a view this series again. The quality is great and the stories are still a relevant commentary on our world today.  I watched these while exercising in the morning and it made the time fly by.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The best show I've seen in a while.  Clever, funny, exciting, and Benedict & Martin excel and warm our hearts.  Bravi!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|reads like written for the TV series too closely, seems to go scene to scene rather than for a book
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I am a caregiver and was drawn to this movie out of curiosity and the fact that Dame Judith Dench is my fav English actress:) I rented it first and then had to go on amazon and purchase it so that I could watch it with some of my fav clients. THEY LOVE IT TOO:)! No spoiler alerts here,,,just have to watch it and love it!
B00400NHRO|5.0|Love this year in the life of an intern. It puts to print thoughts and humor only those in the medical field understand.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I had high hopes for this movie and it delivered. While not as &#34;quotable&#34; as Anchorman, for instance, it's still a great movie to watch.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't know why I resisited this series for so long, but I did. The only good thing about that resistance was that when I gave in to the pleasures that the Crowley family offers, I was able to watch all 3 seasons in a little over a week instead of 3 years! Go on, give in...you won't be sorry!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this app was really fun some glitches but overall good I love playing it while I am bored and its free its great for pet lover's

B009X01FJS|5.0|This case is perfect for what I need it for.  I love the feature of making it vertical.  I use my fire a lot for school to look up websites and laws and to be able to have it stand up and be hands free is great.  Would recommend this to anybody.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love all of the Pendergast novels and this one did not disappoint.  Each one reveals more and more about what shaped his life and I can't wait to get my hands on the next one!  Please don't take too long to get another one written!!!!!!
B0061S073A|5.0|I bought this app from the recommendation of a friend and I am so glad I did.  If you have children that play on your kindle fire you need this app.  My children love that they can control the apps that you load in this app and they cannot access any of your other apps unless they have a password.  It gives you safety and them freedom.
B000FC12SM|5.0|Very helpful - I understand so much more now about the conflicts I have had with my significant other and how to approach communication differently. Great book!

B000N2HBSO|5.0|A very factual and interesting account of one of the critical points of American History! Personalizes many of the famous figures of the civil war era.
B00AW28HF6|5.0|This book takes you on an amazing ride that most of us will never experience. Mr. Gallagher creates a very realistic world that seems to be ripped from today's headlines! Spies, exotic locales, romance, and secret missions - The Tsunami Connection has it all!<br /><br />Mr. Gallagher did a great job with this book!<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of the book to review from the author. The opinions expressed are my own and I am not required to give a positive critique.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Finally introducing my wife and two daughters to this brilliantly entertaining series, in the wake of Joss Whedon taking over the world.  Rewatching it with them absolutely reinforces my opinions -- one of the all-time best sci-fi series ever produced for television, and proving to be relatively timeless -- holds up damn well.  Pai an jiao jue!
B004NNUZ5K|4.0|I'm still an anterior recording engineer and I haven't made a career out of recording or anything, but this book has some great advice and some great informed knowledge that I found useful when mixing. I have a fairly decent education and Experiance with both live music and studio recording and the only thing I didn't enjoy we're something we're simply over my head. They were good insights but things I wouldn't be able to do much about without a lot of money and more education in this field. But all-in-all, it's a great book. I recommend to everyone who wants to record themselves!
1616550414|5.0|A little too Skyward Sword heavy but it does have a lot of information on what goes into creating the game.  Pretty Epic.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|Great fun. Love the interplay between characters.  Great fun. Love the interplay between characters.  Great fun. Love the interplay between characters.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Ordered 4 sets of these. 1 for me and 3 for Christmas gifts. Everyone loved them. The box set has a cool rubberized kind of feel. Looks impressive. Any Batman fan would love this collection.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|I got the 24hr rental and amazon goes down when I wanted to watch it. It was down for like 30mins and started to watch something else then ran out of time to finish it. First time I had a problem with amazon video service.
0765325950|5.0|Holy sweet and sour Christ that was the best ending I could have asked for (with the only exception being the one in which the power of a foursome between Rand and his girls cured all his wounds forever). But kidding aside, this was a crazy good book, and I almost wish I had the same anticipation as the people who waited from 1990 for this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A literate and sophisticated soap opera that humanizes the working and leisure classes of early 20th century Britain. A fascinating look at class warfare and the decline of the landed gentry. Well written and acted and presented in a most entertaining and intimate way through the lives of it's protagonists.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is always interesting to watch scientific minds grapple with seemingly unscientific events. As we learn more about our fundamentally deep connection to each other, we can only improve as a species. Enjoy this journey!
B005HF0BIE|5.0|The relationship between Henry Viii and Anne Boleyn is told very well in this season. Keep in mind that from all Henry's wives she is the one who had the most influence to religion and politics in England. Studies, books etc. are written about Anne, so this season was definitely the one with the most interesting historical facts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love a good romance but every now and then I like to branch out to something a little different. I picked up this series off of amazon as I was browsing through the kindle deals and I'm glad I did. Once I started I couldn't put it down. It's a complicated story but I'll try to put it in simple terms. The world came to an end a long time ago... well, the outside part. What's left of humanity now lives underground in a Silo that goes down about 100 floors. They are following rules that were set up by people that died a very long time ago and some people are beginning to question certain events that take place in the Silo. Of course, questioning the rules is not allowed and could mean a trip outside to \\"clean\\" which is equivalent to the death penalty. Their only view to the outside world is from the windows at the top of the Silo. Over time these windows have to be cleaned or they can't see out at all. Having the windows cleaned is somewhat of a special occasion/holiday. A rare clear view to what is left to the outside world. This is a disturbing and compelling story of how far humanity will go to preserve a way of life even if parts of it do not make sense. There are plenty of surprising events that take place that keep you wondering about the real truth behind the end of the world above and the extreme effort that it took to preserve this underground way of life. There is no way for me to explain any particular events from this book without revealing too much of the plot. But, it is a very good read if you are interested in this particular genre. I am excited that the author has since added three more installments to this series... anxious to continue on this journey!
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was a good story up to the author's usual quality. It is a good mystery and I always enjoy the Harry Bosch stories.
B0052U59F4|4.0|I'll admit it... I loved these books. But when I try to understand why... the answer is... well... vague. I really had to think about it because the story is very ridiculous in some respects but powerful in others. My issues? Well, the timing of this romance is way off... I mean no one can change this quickly, and Christian did a total 180 in a very short period of time. Sure, a person can make a significant impact on your life but rarely does it happen this fast! This story could have been greatly improved with a more realistic pacing of the development of his relationship with Anna. Christian Grey's character was also a bit over the top in his controlling of Anna.  At times in was monotonous and caused an eye roll or two. I also had a BIG issue with the idea that a virgin can become some kind of sexual goddess in a period of six weeks... uummmmmm... no!<br />What did I love? Well, the email banter was a hoot. I laughed a lot during those exchanges and had to go back and re-read them a second time. I also love that this book does somehow awaken the senses and a level of curiosity you might not have thought you ever had. Hey, it might even help improve a marriage or two! (wink wink)<br />The sex is hot... yes maam'... some people like these books only for the book candy. But I liked it for a completely different reason. I loved being a part of Christian's journey towards finding his way to becoming a real man and opening himself up to something real. By the end of book three I found myself really rooting for him.<br /> I was actually kind of proud of this author for touching on a very tabboo subject... the female pedophile. We sometimes like to toss up the idea that young boys cannot be traumatized by the idea of being used in that way by a woman. But, they absolutely can and the results can be just as life changing. Christian was mesmerized by this woman and gave her far more credit than she deserved. Never have I despised a female character more! Needless to say I was giving Anna and also Christian's mom a high five in regards to their opinion of this woman as the story progressed.<br />I'll be the first to admit that this series is not greatly written. There are definitely areas where the author could have spent more time on character development and timing but there is something about these books that seems to grab you and suck you in. If you are curious about Erotica... give this series a go. They are curiously entertaining and great for an afternoon chat and discussion with the ladies when you're done. Go ahead... wake up your inner goddess!

6305428298|4.0|Little Voice is truly a charming fantasy that spins the tale about a painfully shy young woman and how the power of music can lead to an amazing transformation. Laura, nicknamed LV for Little Voice, is the tale of a reclusive young woman who lives in the shadow of her spiteful, shrew-like mother. LV can really only communicate by mimicking performances by torch singers such as Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, and Shirley Bassey. LV is played by Jane Horrocks, who starred in the British cult sit-com \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\". Her mother is played by Brenda Blethyn, who received a very well deserved Academy Award Nomination as Best Supporting Actress. LV spends hours alone in her room playing old records, which she inherited from her beloved late father who shared a fondness for these famous singers. Michael Caine, who received a Best Actor Golden Globe Award for his performance as a sleazy talent agent, discovers the secret of LV's voice and smells money. He hooks up with an equally sleazy nightclub owner played by Jim Broadbent who plans to exploit LV's special talent. Ewan Mcgregor plays a local telephone repair man who also raises pigeons, is really the only character in the movie who seems to honestly care about LV, and tries to communicate with her as much as possible. Horrocks does all of the singing herself and it is truly uncanny the way that she can sound just like her idols. The movie is a vivid adaptation of Jim Cartwright's London play \\"The Rise And Fall Of Little Voice\\". All five characters are excellent! It comes off as an odd British fantasy which plays achingly melancholic at times. Overall, however, I found the film totally uplifting! The running time of the film is 97 minutes with not even one minute wasted. It is in Widescreen format and the transfer is excellent! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!!!
B007IK44CK|4.0|Lots of action but somewhat predictable. That said, it's still a good flic to watch when the networks are all broadcasting reality and reruns.

0060899190|5.0|I read post secret every Sunday. THIS BOOK IS AMAZING! It is perfect for a conversation starter or to put out on a table for company to enjoy!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Overall: Made for a great &#34;date&#34; night at home.<br /><br />Pro: Most people watching the movie already know the ending but the film still manages to be suspensful and interesting.  Glad to see this critical point in history being highlighted for a new generation.  If the movie was intriguing to you, check out the book &#34;Guests of the Ayatollah&#34;.<br /><br />Con: I think even without knowing the story, some of the Hollywood embellishments are obvious.  I would have preferred a little more realistic ending.  A bit of added excitement is nice but this was over-the-top.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I Absolutely love it!!  Calculator Plus is FREE and very user friendly.  I grab my kindle now before my calculator.  Easy to see &amp; use.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was just a fun movie. I'm a bit of a gleek so I loved the acapella singing.  It didn't matter to me that the plot was lacking, the comedy kept me laughing throughout the movie.  Definitely recommend it.
0765367351|5.0|My hunger for more chapters in the story of Rapture is satisfied by this book. Anyone who loves the world of Bioshock will thoroughly enjoy this novel. As if the games didn't give you enough to think about, this book is a treasure trove of new information.
1439156816|5.0|Stephen King starts On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft with snapshots of his life growing up and how it related to making him the writer he is today. On Writing is not told as your typical How-To book, it's not full of exercises or speech on how your dream of becoming a writer will happen with ease. Stephen tells a story about writing and what it takes to become a writer. He explains what skills you will need to have in your \\"tool box\\" and gives you ways to get and ways sharpen those tools to give you the best possible chance to become a good writer. He also gives examples on how to get an agent and how to get your work published. One of the most interesting parts of the book for me was the section on editing your work and improving the flow of the story. His most important advice in the book is that if you want to be a good writer \\"YOU MUST READ A LOT AND YOU MUST WRITE A LOT!\\"<br /><br />By the time I got done reading this book I had a real sense of how much work and dedication it takes to become a writer. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a writer.<br /><br />I'm more than a little embarrassed to admit this, but this is the first book I have read by Stephen King, although,  I have enjoyed many of the movies that have been based on his books. However, I am confident that by the end of the year On Writing will not be the only book I have read by Mr. King.<br /><br />Personally I have never had a desire to become a writer though I have taken a couple writing classes (for fun) and I also participated in National Novel Writing Month in 2012 (and succeeded in writing a book in the month of November). NaNo was also something I did for fun, though it was less fun but more satisfying than I thought it would be. NaNo is something else I would recommend to everyone, wannabe writer or not.<br /><br />After reading On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft I have a realistic view of what it takes to become a writer (if I wanted to). So I give a tip of my hatto Stephen and to all the other writers out there that write the books that transports me to all those wonderful (and horrible) places.
B006OT03BM|5.0|I'm glad I snapped one of these up on the day of release, because it's a real gem! Definitely the jewel of my Transformers movie collection. The big, impressive case looks so beautiful sitting on my shelf. I love having all my movies in one place. The filmstrip signed by Michael Bay is really cool. Any uber-fan will go nuts for this!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Interesting view into teen life. Twist at the end was predictable only because I spend a ton of time with this kind of kid. Worth the read for parents as much or more than for the kids.
B008Q7O6VS|4.0|Its a great box set, but not all that it could be. I was hoping for more unreleased songs and stuff, but all it is is the remastered CTE with a live show (a great concert none the less) and some postcards. Really good if your a collector, but its not for everyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book..very well written and a great story..wish it was more romantic.. I would recommend this book who likes romance and happy endings

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is supposed to be for young adults. However, my daughter, who is 36, loaned me the first book of the trilogy in paperback saying she really liked it. I started reading the first book she loaned me and decided to download all three books to my Kindle so I could read them all right away. I couldn't put my Kindle down.

030758836X|5.0|I loved this book! I read it in 2 days and intend to reread it. There is plenty to pull you in during the first half of the book but when the second half is reached it is hard to put it down. The Chapters alternate between the points of view of the husband and wife, first at different points in time and by the second half of the book they are on the same timeline. It is hard to explain here, but easy to follow as you are reading. Fabulous book!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This was a gift, and is being used well. Good quality, and has mulitple uses for little girls.  You could have mulitples of these and stack them and make a cute decor in a kids room while creating storage. Helped foster my niece to pick up little pieces as well as Barbie and not lose them.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I honestly don't know what to add to all of the reviews that have already extolled the virtues of this book, other than another data point saying how truly exceptional it is.<br /><br />A tragic tale set during WWII and narrated by Death, the premise sounds as bleak as it gets, so the humor the tale is told with really surprised me. Now, that's not to say that this is a comedy. The subject matter is serious, and at no point is suffering made the butt of a cheap joke. Rather, the material is handled with a light touch that keeps the reader engaged with the personal narrative unfolding against the larger backdrop and offers the opportunity for insightful commentary on human nature that couldn't be delivered as effectively any other way. The result is that the tone is profoundly humane rather than irreverent, and all the more moving for it. Don't pass this one up, it's absolutely worth the read.
0810989956|4.0|It's awesome but did not give as much room to write in as I'd hoped.<br /><br />&#34;The kinds of questions they ask in the book are funny,&#34; said Tommy.

B00AEFY3MC|5.0|This movie is hilarious and every time it is on TV I have to watch it.  It is kind of a spoof of Star Trek, but so funny.  The movie starts as the cast of a show that has been off the air for some time meets up at a convention.  They meet real aliens, who think their show was actual history, and ask for their help.  The movie then proceeds with the cast helping the aliens and all the fun that is attached to it.  Such a funny movie. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub are excellent make this movie great and hilarious.
0316017930|4.0|The Outliers is a look at what author Malcolm Gladwell thinks make a person successful. Gladwell talks about family, location and time of being born.  These are all subjects that define us to the point whether we struggle getting the success or stuck at the bottom.<br /><br />I thought the first half of Outliers was interesting as Gladwell talks about months and years people are born that may factor into a person success.<br /><br />I was more or less bored reading the second half which discussed families, and locations that define how hard you are going to work to be successful.  I also did not agree some of the facts discussed in the second half.<br /><br />Outliers is an interesting read.  I picked it because some of the other books I had been reading mentioned it.  I would be interested in some of Gladwell's other books.

034544678X|5.0|SUGGESTED AUDIENCE: Dog lovers wanting to improve the relationship with their dog by understanding how dogs and primates can better communicate with one another.<br /><br />Back in the early 1990's, when we still lived in Wisconsin and before we got into the pet care business, Paula and I attended several dog training classes with our dogs Gus and Shed. It was not until 1994 that we found Dr. Patricia McConnell and her training school, Dog's Best Friend. This was the first class that all of us, humans and dogs alike, truly enjoyed. Why? Because of Trisha's understanding of how dogs and humans communicate and her emphasis on rewarding good behavior. Now the world can benefit from her knowledge in her new book, The Other End Of The Leash.<br /><br />The Other End Of The Leash is an information-packed, yet readable book. In it you will learn how to have an improved relationship with your dog through better communication. As a scientist who has studied both primate and canine communication systems, Dr. McConnell has a keen understanding of where the communication between humans and dogs often breaks down, creating frustration and stress for both species. For example, she explains how simple innate greeting patterns of both species can cause conflict. We know that when two people meet, the polite thing to do is to make direct eye contact and walk straight toward one another smiling. However, as Dr. McConnell notes: \\"The oh-so-polite primate approach is appallingly rude in canine society. You might as well urinate on a dog's head.\\" The fact is direct eye contact and a direct approach is very confrontational to a dog.<br /><br />Dr. McConnell also emphasizes how dogs primarily communicate visually, while humans are a very verbal species. The picture she paints of the frustrated chimp, jumping up and down, waving their hands, and screeching repeatedly is only a slight exaggeration of the frustrated human, saying \\"sit, sit, sit, ahhhh please sit\\" while displaying countless bits of body language. Primates, including humans, \\"...have a tendency to repeat notes when we're excited, to use loud noises to impress others, and to thrash around whatever is in our paw if we're frustrated. This behavior has no small effect on our interactions with dogs, who in spite of some barks and growls, mostly communicate visually, get quiet rather than noisy to impress others, and are too busy standing on their paws to do much else with them.\\" With these fundamental differences, it's amazing we can communicate with our dogs at all.<br /><br />While Trisha's book will certainly enlighten you, it will also move you. Her description of her relationships with her own animals leaves no doubt about her love and commitment. Reading her recollection of how her beloved Luke was almost hit by a car and the passing of her little Border Collie Misty had me very near tears.<br /><br />FAVORITE QUOTES: \\"If humans are understandably a bit slow at responding to the visual signals that our dogs are sending, we are downright dense about the signals that we generate ourselves.\\"<br /><br />\\"Forcing dogs into 'submission' and screaming in their face is a great way to elicit defensive aggression. It makes sense that a dog would bite, or at least threaten to, in this context. Within their social framework, you're acting like a lunatic.\\"<br /><br />\\"It seems very human to stay fixated on the negative: 'No!' seems to come out of our mouths as easily as breathing. But saying no doesn't teach a dog what to do, and it keeps the attention focused on it and nothing else.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend The Other End Of The Leash for anyone with a dog in their life.its of body language.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This is one of the few movie series where redundancy is expected & enjoyed. Daniel Craig actually makes some of the over-the-top action scenes look plausible. And Skyfall has a pretty good story line, to go along with all the action.
B00133KFGW|3.0|Let me be up front right now.  This movie is more about faith and music connecting everybody than anything.  The story begins with Keri Russel and Jonathan Rhys Meyers playing Lyla and Louis, 2 individuals involved in music in different ways.  Lyla is with the philharmonic and Louis is in a band.  They meet one night, have a deep connection and then Lyla is forced away by her father.  Lyla becomes pregnant and ends up in an accident.  Her father tells her the baby died, but we then turn to the baby turned into an 11 year old at a boys home.  The story then becomes about Evan (August Rush) and his journey throughout New York in order to play his music to find his parents.  There are some really great moments in the movie, but you have to be able to put doubt about Lyla hearing Evan's symphony and knowing that is her son aside and just enjoy the movie.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Was really surprised by the excellent acting and the great storyline all around. SOA is a great show to watch, cannot believe it took me this long to find it. Using Amazon Prime on my XBOX and iPad really made it a great way to watch.
0307346617|5.0|As a bonafide zombie fan, I'm always on the lookout for stories about the un-dead, whether they're in print or on the big screen. After recently seeing a commercial for the upcoming movie of the same title- a family member suggested the book & highly recommended it. I was not disappointed. Each chapter describes, in detail, each country's approach to the zombie apocalypse & contains individual accounts of the horrors they witnessed & how they survived the terrible times.. Lots of details, lots of really creepy imagery... I couldn't put it down.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Listen,  this is where Star Trek began.  Sure some of the episodes are corny but there are some real gems in there.  But Star Trek TOS set the stage for the entire franchise and the idea that man can eventually move beyond petty interests and achieve great things.

B000065K6N|5.0|There was a time when I would have said that I do not like anime. The most accessible stuff, frankly, embarrasses me.<br /><br />While visiting a friend a few years ago, he exposed me to some of the &#34;good stuff&#34; and I now have a completely new respect for anime. One of the films he showed me was Mononoke.<br /><br />This film has the feeling of epic folklore. It was well done and even the American voice-overs (for an American who has had no exposure to oriental languages) were in character.<br /><br />I consider this film a classic.
B005FISC52|3.0|I have been a fan since the show began.  However, toward the end of the sixth season everything just started to get to be a little much.  I felt like the show had started to go downhill.  They replaced some main stars and brought it people that weren't needed and didn't fit.  But this last season actually brought the show back to where it was in the first few seasons, well close to it.  Good end to the show.

B003EV6DBM|3.0|The fifth series begins with the introduction of Matt Smith as the new Doctor and Amelia Pond as his new companion.  Well Matt Smith begins very poorly as the doctor, decent but not great.  By the end of the season he grows into the role, although I still have to say I prefer Eccleston and Tennant, but we are stuck with Smith.  But what is worse than the new doctor is the new companion.  Amy (Amelia) Pond is obnoxious, annoying, and irritating as the doctor's new companion.  All she seems to want to do is try to make out with him for the first few episodes-even though she is engaged I might add.  Another thing is that the show, from this point and on into the sixth season, becomes the Amy Pond Show.  She is smarter than the doctor and the focus of almost every episode and both the fifth seasons series story arc as well as the sixth season's story arc.  I love Doctor Who and while Amy Pond, to me, ruins the season for me, there are still some great episodes in this season.

B00ATP24SW|5.0|You're reading a review written by someone who's favorite band has been Stratovarius for a decade and counting, and it was written the day the album came out.  Taking into account the popularity of the band in the metal world, you've probably heard a few tidbits about the album so far.  I'm going to simply review the album for what it is in my perspective and where I see it fitting into the Stratovarius archive overall.<br /><br />Stratovarius has been #1 for me for 10 years for one leading reason:  The songs pick up the listener (save some of the older songs, like Twilight Symphony and Dreamspace).  Almost any Stratovarius song makes for wonderful morning music.  I can proudly listen to this music around anybody anywhere anytime.  (I sang Eagleheart while skydiving for heaven's sake.)  But I'm not some maniac who walks around \\"hell year Stratovarius hell yeah hell yeah!!\\"  I'm not some possessed thrash metal maniac who wears steel-tipped boots seven days a week or anything.  A friend of mine has called me a \\"metalhead incognito.\\"<br /><br />The way Stratovarius songs \\"pick up\\" the listener is, in a way, this band's intensity, or aggression.  They've never had more than three really fast songs on one album before (unless you count the sections in Holy Light or Visions as full songs), yet no Stratovarius album is a walk in the park.  The aggression on this album is found in the effect the songs have on the listener - not that the instruments are firing on all cylinders the way we have seen in the past with songs like the progressive Deep Unknown, the fast Black Diamond or Father Time, or the ambitious Elements.<br /><br />The first 3 songs are where you'll find Stratovarius-esque classics like Eagleheart and Hunting High and Low that we'll still be talking about 6 years from now.  But it's the might in the remaining 8 songs that puts this album on a pedestal.<br /><br />I'm not much for song-by-song analyses in my reviews, but, as a listener, when I entered Halcyon Days (track 4) for my first time, I finally saw captured the atmosphere being painted here (largely by the cover art).  Stratovarius hasn't quite done an atmosphere like this before.  I'm recalling something Jens or Timo (I think Jens) says in the promotional video released in the latter half of 2012 announcing Rolf as the new drummer.  He said that it felt like this band \\"is not meant to quit.\\"  That's the atmosphere.  Stratovarius has better than ever before identified the adversity that they urge listeners to overcome.  We've seen this in countless classic Stratovarius songs before; it's what makes them what they are, rather than a comical Helloween, a serious Grave Digger or Primal Fear, a fantasy-oriented Rhapsody [of Fire], etc.  Take Darkest Hours for example.  The song so positively says \\"I've made it through the Darkest Hours of my days.\\"  Well, the atmosphere in a song like Halcyon Days IS those darkest hours.  This band sounds like one who is not only solidifying their position as a continuing leader in melodic heavy metal with symphonic and power metal influences (sometimes progressive), but that they seem angry that so many people counted them out for years (namely the latter half of the 2000's before Polaris).  Take a look at that cover art - we've never seen fire and destruction on a Stratovarius cover art before.  Up until now, they've all been paradisiacal, light-bearing, nature-inspired, or spacey.  Not this time, no siree.<br /><br />Yes, the progressive tendencies have taken a step back and been replaced by a more straightforward melodic heavy metal approach that put Finland on the map at the end of the 80's as a country that can contribute metal on a world-class level (along with Amorphis - another band who has never released the same album twice).  Frankily, I may never have associated Polaris and Elysium as \\"progressive\\" if I hadn't read that somewhere.  To me, Stratovarius is just Stratovarius.  A guitar-playing friend of mine once said that playing anything by a Finnish band is far harder than bands from other countries.  So it's a given; I expect a certain level of sophistication with one of these albums going in.  Nemesis is by no means a \\"black sheep\\" in the world of Finnish metal.<br /><br />If there's one criticism I have of this album, it's the following:  There aren't any points on the album where I can confidently say that the musicians are performing to their potential.  Now sure, I love Stratovarius as much as the next guy for all of the softer, more epic-feeling songs (ex. Season of Change, Lifetime In a Moment, Alpha & Omega, Tears of Ice).  But on all of these albums, there was at least one moment where Jens was impressing us with his keyboarding skill, or Jorg (now Rolf) impressing us with his drumming, or Timo reminding us why he is one of the leaders in melodic metal vocalists (etc).  Deep Unknown still strikes me as an incredible, almost over-reaching song in this respect.  Granted, I've only owned this album for a couple of hours, but I've been digging for moments like these, and it's the one thing I can't find with this album.  (Perhaps this is off-topic, but I found it interesting that almost all of Cain's Offering's \\"Gather the Faithful\\" album (with Timo on vocals) was full of these moments.)  Jens has some solid solos at the beginning and end of the album, and Stand My Ground opens with an unfamiliar riffing style for the band (more expected by a band like Primal Fear in a song like \\"Fear\\").  And ok, there are unfamiliar vocal lines in the Abandon pre-chorus.  Out in the Fog is the only song with an impressive, lengthy instrumental section.  I love the line \\"There's no Helen in my Troy\\" in \\"The Story Is Over.\\"  This is all I have so far.  The overall atmosphere of the album doesn't really suffer from this, but for someone familiar with the talent level of the members of this band, there is a little still to be desired.  (Japan's Galneryus comes to mind - those guys led by Syu neverseem to hesitate when it comes to showing off their latest talents.)<br /><br />Favorites?  I'd say Halcyon Days and Fantasy are this album's Season of Change, Phoenix, Forever Is Today, or Twilight Symphony:  Neither are singles, they will probably never be a single, they're not a title track or album opener, but these songs rubbed me exactly the way I want a Stratovarius song to.  It feels criminal to pick only two, but recall what I said about this portion of the album above - this is the moment when the album moves away from single, metal-fan-grabbing songs to the ones that really bring the album to a higher level.  (I'm recalling the transition from Eagleheart to Soul of a Vagabond on Elements 1 - the transition from Stand My Ground to Halcyon Days has a very similar effect on me.)  I also love Fantasy.  It has one of the more sing-song choruses on the album, and it's paired with some an atmosphere almost akin to wandering through a dense forest in a role playing video game (like a Final Fantasy game) matching a pace almost identical to \\"Why Are We Here?\\" from Intermission.<br /><br />One last note.  No epics.  No Visions, Destiny, Infinite, Elements, or Elysium.  I'll admit, when I first saw that, I said to myself, \\"Oh, shucks.\\"  But the album doesn't miss such a song.  This album doesn't need one.  There isn't an epic/symphonic backdrop on the album that would welcomingly support it.  Elysium is still keeping me plenty busy anyhow.  (Look at how complete of an album Dreamspace is without any songs over 6:00 - to date, the only Stratovarius album to make that claim.)<br /><br />Some of you no doubt have questions remaining, such as, \\"Is Rolf a good enough replacement for Jorg?\\"  \\"Are there any fast songs like Black Diamond?\\"  I'm not gonna tell you everything; I'm choosing to leave some things for you to decide.  I've said plenty.<br /><br />If you make the decision to purchase (or download or borrow or steal or heaven knows what) this album, you're not justgetting 57 minutes of music.  You're getting a statement.  This band has put their foot down, and the earth has shaken.

0140186395|4.0|At 600 pages, East of Eden is a serious commitment but one that is well worth the effort. It beautifully captures life in America from the Civil War to the end of WWI while creating page-turning excitement thanks in large part to the terrifying machinations of its villain Cathy Ames, possibly the most insidious figure in all literature. (And I mean that.) It is an incredibly ambitious, meandering, sweeping, disorganized and totally mesmerizing experience. It is far from perfect. The allusions to the story of Cain and Abel started to border on tiresome, and some generous editing would have been welcome. But that doesn't take a way from the book's hypnotic power and the magic of its finely portrayed characters. I felt that I knew Samuel Hamilton and the servant Lee, like they were sitting in my living room. Character development is the book's greatest strength, along with the dream-like descriptions of the Salinas Valley. Just beautiful.

B0099HUB8Q|4.0|I first came across this series of novels back in the 1970s and, despite being an avid fan of the TV series, this was first time I have revisited the novels since my first reading. Suffice to say, I was not disappointed with these wonderful stories of a young James Herriot, his partner Siegfried Farnon and his amiable but mischievous brother, Tristan. A pure delight to read.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Excellent!!!! I bought the album because I loved the song A TEAM.......the album was so good, that was my least listened to song after a while....you can listen to this album from start to finish w/o skipping any bad songs...there aren't any
B00BHMF578|5.0|Watch this movie, you'll be glad you did. Ben Affleck is an amazing director and his movies prove it. The story is awesome and when you're watching it, you really feel what the actors are feeling.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|Okay yes, my review may be a bit jaded since I'm a Michael fan ... however, he does an excellent job of interpreting the songs.  I grew up listening to these songs and Michael has nailed them.  Delicious tonal inflections.  He doesn't duplicate the songs, he understands them.  Great listen.  The RIP promotion is a nice added benefit too!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie.  Full of actilon and computer graphics were outstanding.  My kids (10 & 12) were glued to their seats for the whole picture.  Need a sequal to this one.  Wish they had movies like this when I was growing up.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely contagious, one can hardly wait to view the next session. Loyalty between the servants and the royals is tight knitted. Downton Abbey is a refreshing break in entrainment and in a sense provides history of another era.  Can't wait for Season 3!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is so easy to use the streaming video on my Kindle Fire HD to watch this television series. Excellent!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin wove a mountain of research into a beautifully written flow of action and dialogue.  Its detail provides important insights into the history of the U.S. and the life and person of Abraham Lincoln.  One realizes Lincoln's monumental stature--and his historical importance--only after seeing how he accomplished what he did.  The Gettyburg Address comes alive, thanks to DKG's capture of Lincoln's genius.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Great movie. Loved the great hd stream. This was a well put together movie that i will definitely watch again.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I was thinking all was well until I bought a case for my Kindle. When I started the app, I found that it was upside-down and would not orient correctly. I suppose it's anyone's opinion on which way is up, but it would be better to make either orientation work.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|This microphone, battery and all, ended up recording with less sensitivity than did the built-in microphone in the device I was hoping to make more sensitive.  A real disappointment.  But it was cheap, so maybe I expected too much.
B008H08XW2|5.0|The the CD is great.  It came sooner then expected.  The package was great.  Nothing was damaged.  Would order CD again.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|What a wonderful adventure! The writing is absolutely beautiful, and the story is captivating. I highly recommend Life of Pi to any reader. I cannot wait to see Any Lee's film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love it! Focus on the original group and it's dinamics and its all good for me.....I really love the original group, Maggie and the girls with the baby and her brother as protector!!!  The problems they are having in the prison are real and exciting but I think they are going to have to get on the move again and go underground to hide from the crazy man in the city.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It works  . No problem s  and easy-to-use. Like I said no problems. And that's it. Nothing else to say
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like the fact that I can read my books on all my devices. Some times I don't have my kindle with me - always have my phone on me.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, though the hero had a much better attitude about his situation than I can ever imagine.
B00006879E|5.0|Great CD.  The music is very good.  Listen to them in my car all of the time.  Don't listen to the radio much now that I have these CD's.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|This Roman Polanski film is a classic of American film. It has held up very well, and is both gripping and visually outstanding. If you are too young to remember Jack Nicholson when he was young and sexy, not the fat guy in shades at the Lakers' games, you have toi see Chintown.
B002LC8HF0|3.0|This final installment wrapped up all plot points introduced in earlier books, which made for a satisfying conclusion.  I must say though that I found the ending, indeed the whole point of conflict, a bit contrived.  I found the author's effort to make the series a commentary on social conditions to result in a plot that I felt was overwrought.  I also found the ending resolution to be a bit on the deus ex machina side.<br /><br />The Kindle version also had a fair amount of typos and grammatical errors, enough for them to stand out and stick to my memory.  I also found some expository monologues of POV characters to appear hurried, and sometimes contained contradictory elements for the sake of quick resolution.
B006Z00R1Q|4.0|It scared me and made me scream.and that my kind of movie. If you like things that scares you this is what you should watch.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|Will Smith is great in this movie. My son enjoyed the movie very much. Good sci-FI guy movie. Dog was beautiful!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Although I am a huge fan of this series, I was disappointed with the final book, Mockingjay. I feel as though Suzanna Collins did such a great job with the story buildup in the first two books and the beginning of the third, but the ending was abrupt and rushed. Throughout the series the reader sees Katniss staying loyal and staying true to herself and to her beliefs but by the end of the third book Katniss seems to have lost all of those wonderful qualities because of all of the heartache and difficulty she has endured. To me it was hard to see what the author was going for, and the great moral of the story, that was included in both books one and two, seems to disappear by the conclusion of the third novel. Seem to me like Suzanne Collins rushed to finish the ending when there's no reason she needed to! She's making millions of dollars off this series, she could've concluded it better!
B005EVVESM|5.0|The CD is great.  The music on it rocks.  Listen to it all the time in my car.  Shipped on time and in great condition
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It  was a good very much similar to the Movie so all I have to do now is watch the Movie again and compare and contrast
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I gave this four stars.  All the elements of a great fantasy story were present.  Pacing and character development was good.<br /><br />My only nitpick is that the plot follows what I've come to see as the common fantasy plot.  Old and wise teacher/wizard discovers young boy/girl with undiscovered extraordinary talents; then goes on to save the world.  I'd have given it a five if the plot took a more original spin.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Johnny's music is country, but I swear his songwriting and singing is blues. I dare anybody to listen to &#34;Man In Black&#34;, &#34;Folsom Prison Blues&#34; or the version of &#34;Hurt&#34; on this album and not FEEL something! Best photo of all time inside tray card (and a very cool touch)! This man is a legend and this record let's everyone know why. I can't wait to play this album again and again on my next highway trip!
B0049J5EOK|4.0|My three year old son loves this movie.  It is my least favorite of the three Toy Story movies, but is definitely entertaining.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Poignant,sweet and refreshingly real. Everything about this movie is great - the actors, the acting, the story, the directing, even the ending. The chemistry between these three kids is amazing and the simple plot twists kept it from being predictable and boring. Will definitely be one of the best films of the year.
B000P2A256|5.0|Great CD.  Listen to it all the time in my car.  The shipping was on time and could not pick one of the four that I bought as which one is best.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I was disappointed in his selection of songs.  As is with most of his albums, one must listen to them over and over, but so far I have not found them songs I want to hear often.  I am a fan of Josh Groban, just not his choice of tunes.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a great read.I will suggest this book to anyone who asks for an interesting,twisted story.The way it ended was a total surprise.I would have liked  the obvious to have happened,however still a great book.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|you dont have to &quot;stand on my neck&quot; for me to sit back, chill, and watch this animated series. DARIA ROCKS!!! i remember hangin with my highschool friends watchin the daria episodes. sit back, crack open a cold one and enjoy :)
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|At first I thought this app did not work because it did not go off as planned but than I tried it while my kindle fire hd was just asleep and not powered completely off and it worked just fine. Nice and loud and did what it said it would.
B009CF7JDU|1.0|Don't think I laughed once. Thought it was boring. I've heard a bunch of people say they liked it... So after that build up I was expecting more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this book was science fiction. When I heard it isn't sci-fi I decided to read it. Great story, built on imagination and a great story. It's not a deep read, but a great book to pick up when you have time. If you liked the Harry Potter series, you will enjoy this book. Now I'd like to see the movie.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|This is the best CD out of the 3 they just came out with. I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 because there is a lot of unnecessary swearing. It's a really good Album though. My favorite songs on UNO are: 1. Kill The DJ (best song on the record) 2. Troublemaker 3. Loss of Control 4. Stay the Night 5. Carpe Diem 6. Angel Blue 7. Oh Love<br />All the songs are good, those are just my favorite ones.
B000I0QM0E|5.0|Must watch this movie, its a Classic.  Well known actors and great special effects.  I love this movie.  Overall Epic!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Exelente me ahorro mucho tiempo al buscar esa pagina gracias a Dios esto de la technology ah mejorado mucho a favor de todos los usuario espero sigamos mejorando cara dia mas. gracias una vez mas por estas paginas ;)
B0095P31L6|5.0|Love anything with Depp. Laughed out loud also very touching.Forgot I was watching a movie on a small tablet,could have been on a large screen. I was lost in the movie
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A total must read. If Christian got your attention in the first two books then you must read the final chapter I the trilogy. Totally yummy.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Be ready for a lot of reading. Book one has merely introduced the motley cast of characters, but it has been an enjoyable intro. I immediately purchased book 2!
B004GHBQ7O|4.0|I purchased this Record for the live recordings, but the concert on the DVD was good to. The American Idiot recording has an awesome 10 minute solo in it. And if you get this CD, make sure you watch the Time of Your Life performance that Billi Joe does at the end, it's incredible.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Unbelievable and life-changing book.  You will never look at parenting or success the same way again.  So many interesting anecdotes and studies.
0393330435|4.0|This is not the touchie-feelie yoga life of Steve Jobs... this is an engineer/inventor as good as it gets.  A fun read and very interesting for anyone that likes the tech side of computers not the lifestyle stuff.
B00B7FXZQS|3.0|They used many of the old tricks from PA#2 and PA#3. You can expect the peak of the movie, no more surprises.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I was able to download a 7 part series about music mastering straight to my phone to have at anytime for reference.  Absolutely love this app!!
B0073B587E|3.0|I haven't had a chance to play with this guitar much yet , but it is great in teaching me chords. A fun instrument.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if youe  ever wanted a horse this is the app for it i love it and you will too. best app ever
B0076DELIG|4.0|The story is well written. The plot is slowly unwound, blended with developments in Bosch's personal life. I hope that Bosch's character tenacity and search for justice reflect that of active detectives. I look forward to the next story.
B008602KQI|2.0|Purchased the DVD and enjoyed the movie very much.  Did not watch it on Amazon because there were not subtitles.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This game \\"Subway Surfed \\" is okay, but not the best game ever. It makes no sense to get in one lane and be blocked by a train and die. It's very unfair in my opinion. Overall this game is fun, addictive and okay. Still when I purchased the item,  I thought it would have more features and special effects than that.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|When I first watched this show a few years back, I was annoyed by some of the acting, but I loved the premise of the &#34;Space Western&#34; and I thought it was handled very well by the creators. Still, at the time, I would have given it 3.5 stars because it can definitely be a little hokey, though seldom recycled. Since then, I've realized that I get more out of the show every time I watch it, due mostly to the excellent writing and the novelty of the reverse-steampunk setting.<br /><br />In my opinion, the final episode (Objects in Space) is a standalone science fiction classic capable of holding up against any sci-fi short story I've ever read, due to its emphasis on existential topics and its introspective, slightly creepy and very claustrophobic presentation.<br /><br />It's such a shame that Firefly had to be so short lived, but I believe the short run makes it that much sweeter and is a good compliment to the poignant atmosphere of the story. I'll be buying the complete box set soon!
B00BHMF578|4.0|Well done production and very good, edge of your seat screenplay. Good selection of acting talent all around. Can't miss this one.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|This book is truly now even close to his previous works. It is hard to tell that this is the same writer who gave us &#34;Atonement&#34;.
0525478817|5.0|I love love love this book! It is very real and doesn't sugarcoat anything. I won't give any spoilers but have some tissues handy during the whole book.
B008220D7S|1.0|\\"This Is 40\\" was one of my biggest letdowns last year at the movies. And you need to realize that I am a huge fan of Judd Apatow and Paul Rudd. The problem is that the movie just ISN'T funny. It's a bickering, narcissistic mess of a script. In a bit of fatherly nepotism, it has two cloying performances by Apatow's children. I honestly didn't laugh once. Be warned. The one star from me is well deserved...look it up on imdb...and be suspicious of the rave reviews.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very cool so far. I haven't run into any problems and I'm using a kindle fire. I just started and I'm getting the hang of this. I recommend this app if you love simulation games or horses!
B005529EI2|5.0|I love it!!!! I am a HUGE Lord of the Rings fan so this is amazing either way....  I love the movies and Frodo!!! Ummm....... So you should deffinetley download this movie. It is truly amazing
B00A757EFW|1.0|It was a waste of time downloading this game. I thought I could let my son play this and enjoy it. I deleted it from my Kindle.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Good game but sooooooo slow like when ur playing its boaring it gets really boaring ever time time when u play
B009UWYFFK|5.0|My little boy absolutely adores this movie, and the blu-ray quality is absolutely amazing! Wonderful family-friendly film. Great humor to engage the adults, as well.
B005LAJ1O0|2.0|Aliens I can believe in, not ghosts.  Too much gratuitous violence just for the sake of violence.  Good movie for teenagers.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Very funny and entertaining. Predictable but it kept you watching! I would watch it again with my friends or on a rainy day.
0062007297|5.0|This book gives you a real deep inside look into Bon Jovi's good times and some not so good times. Its one of those books I didn't want to put down
B0067RQYNW|3.0|What I have used of this product I like, but it's taking some getting used to.  I would recommend it to others.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We anticipate each episode of Downtown Abbey!  The characters are well cast, the costuming superb, and the plots and subplots kept our rapt attention. Our only regret is having to wait for Season 4!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Was highly recommended by some friends who enjoy many of the same books/ authors as I do.<br />This was an enjoyable book which has flashes of brilliant humour and a delightfully absurd conflating of history and the life of the 100 year old man.<br />But there are also some &#34;boring&#34; passages that could perhaps have benefited from some editing.<br />On the whole recommended but not without some reservations
B00018D44U|2.0|Love Norah Jones and have several of her CDs, but this one was a big disappointment. Can we say boring? And I've never heard of most of these songs and they were not interesting and the performance was lack luster. Would not recommend.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is my latest obsession!!! All of the songs are SO good. Some are passionate and soulfoul - some just sassy and fun. Love them all!
B001NLKXK2|3.0|This book tore at my heartstrings and I wanted to stop what was happening to Alice and I know there is no way anyone can change this when it happens.  I did not want to continue reading but I could not put it down.  It's like knowing the outcome but you still have to follow all the paths that get you there.  It also made me realize how vulnerable we all are for this situation in our own lives. I must say I was depressed but also enlightened at the same time after reading this book.
0761169253|5.0|Es el mejor y más práctico de todos los libros que conozco sobre creatividad. Es obligado para cualquier persona que se interese por los procesos de creación artística. Os va a encantar, totalmente recomendado.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I loved the books, I know many didn't though.  I honestly can't even imagine who they could get to do justice to Christian.  Honestly, it's going to be difficult.  We all have a picture of him, (just like Edward Cullen) so to please every woman would be impossible.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game I have had it forever its so silly and fun! you must try this game its not a waste of 99 &cent;
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This book was extremely hard to get into.  I almost returned it to Amazon.  However, once you get to the part where Holden and Sky start dating it picks up.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Some novels just don't grab me like they do others.  Couldn't put my finger on what it lacked, but it just didn't float my boat.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I hope there is more to come!!! : ) This was a great deal for this book!I think a kid would enjoy this! I'm a kid too I would know!!! :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved being able to watch from my computer. I was able to watch the entire Season 2 easily and quickly.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved the books, I know many didn't though.  I honestly can't even imagine who they could get to do justice to Christian.  Honestly, it's going to be difficult.  We all have a picture of him, (just like Edward Cullen) so to please every woman would be impossible.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love this show, and its so easy to keep up on episodes with Amazon Instant video!<br />Thank you Amazon!
B00BHMF578|5.0|It won the Oscar for a lot of reasons.  It is a must see. It has a great cast and a great script.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I needed an app that could loop video over and over again on a Coby tablet. I could not get other programs to work, but this one did! It seems like an easy task but believe me I tried over 10 apps without success. That may be because of how low budget the tablet, but all I know is this program works.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I watched the first season, then went on to devour all the books.  This is an excellent story, with so many layers.  The casting for the series is almost perfection.  My only complaint, and I'm not a prude, is the amount of gratuitous sex scenes.  For me, it's so excessive that it stands out as a gimic and doesn't add to the show.  Otherwise, I just can't get enough of this show!!
B0078PC030|4.0|We had the grandkids over for a slumber party (ages 7,10, 11) and we streamed this movie. It's good clean cut wholesome movie; and you don't have to worry about foul language, sexually explicit scenes or violence. This movie was filled with a good sense of humor and great photography as well as imaginative creativity! The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating was because I save that rating for stories with a good bottom line or a life learning message. Great fun movie for kids and us too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed all three seasons, saw an episode from season three and decided it was good, so I went back to season one, episode one and watched all up to and including season three, episode 7. Also read a little and watched bonus videos along with researching the production, now I am anxiously awaiting season four.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It has been years since I have enjoyed a series as much as Downton Abbey.  Can't wait until Season 4 begins.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|This was a wonderful movie that is a follow up to the Firefly series.  Great characters and adventure.  Hope they will make another!
B00406O7YK|5.0|The film is excellent. My problem was it didn't stream - start stop load over and over. I have high speed Internet. Didn't finish the movie.
B005XI94HY|5.0|Such a beautiful sound.  Haunting, enchanting and full of depth.  This album is packed with goodness, there isn't one song I don't llike... most of them I LOVE!
B00498TQV8|4.0|Good movie. Entertaining and realistic. I live in Missouri and have traveled through areas like that. It's almost like being in a third world nation.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I liked the story line and characters. I just wish it would have lasted more than 2 seasons. I would have liked to see them fight some T1000's to see how they would have killed them.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|A wonderfully written book full of adventure, mystery, and imagination. I recommend it for anyone looking to slip into a world of curiosity and excitement.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I discovered this series years after its initial airing.  Had to buy the DVD immediately.  One of the finest science fiction adventure series ever.  A must for all sci-fi lovers.
B007Y612KA|5.0|This is a good movie but it is physically dark. But the film was fun. Second or third viewing. Enjoy.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I had always liked Dr. Who when I watched it years ago. I found the new series to be constantly imaginative in plot, and usually with surprisingly touching outcomes.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Loved this book and still can't stop talking about it.  Very informative and presented in an interesting way.  Although Diamond has most of his experience in PNG the book is well documented and strings loads of data together in a remarkably delightful read.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Interesting to see all the dynamics within an aristocratic house and I'm talking about the servants not the family in the house.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like the 3D effect to this game.  My daughter and I play this a lot. It's a great version of this game and would recommend this app to others who are looking for a good mahjon app.
0375842209|5.0|Death doesn't pick up those souls as gleefully as you might think.  No, he is overworked and emotionally involved, especially during WWII Germany.<br /><br />The writing in this book is wonderful.  It is often in passive voice and that works very well.  Yes, I know that writing teachers say not to use it, but there is a time and a place for it, and this book is both.  The voice becomes less passive as the story goes on, as Death is less able to keep his emotional distance.  Adjectives are surprising, odd, beautiful, and don't seem self-conscious as metaphors often do.<br /><br />The characters couldn't be better.  Gruff Rosa, gentle Hans, Max, the mayor's wife, and of course, Rudy and Liesel.  I felt that I knew them, and most of them caused me to love them.<br /><br />Death often gives us bolded snippets of information, starting with:<br /><br />* * * HERE IS A SMALL FACT * * *<br />You are going to die.<br /><br />The printed book has handwritten stories and drawings, and I think that listening to the book would not be as effective as reading it.<br /><br />This book is recommended for grades 9 and up, but it is a great book for adults, shouldn't be stuck into a YA niche.  At over 500 pages, it is a fairly long read but quite easy to read.  That doesn't make is simplistic.  This one got into my heart.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Great film and lots of action and fun. Enjoyed the story line and the characters. Well filmed. I liked it and will probably watch again.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|A well - done series that does a good job of building the relationships of the characters over time. Is clever the way they introduce the transporter... Plus it's in wide - screen!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got the free version but you couldn't save worlds but in this game you can it is the best game ever you should get it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly is one of the best, especially when he writes about Harry Bosch. Hopefully he will write another about Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I got this app so my daughter could experience a game from my past.  She has a lot of fun.  However, I wish there was a little more sensitivity to the joy stick. Sometimes we move it but it doesn't respond very quickly.  It's still a fun game and it's just like the original.  We really enjoy it!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Glued to my seat. Great story. Excellent acting. Someone told me that this was based on a true story... I'll need to check that out... Follow up:  True Story? No. I've scoured the internet. Flight is NOT based on a true story.
B002EMESSM|5.0|An extended TV episode.  Not quite written as a movie, but it has all of the charm of the original series.
0871404133|5.0|Another great piece in my collection. When you think that you have read it all on evolution a great surprise appears!!
B004OZZ624|4.0|This movie started slowly then quickly took some twists and turns before leading you into the thrilling ending. Well made and acted!
144471032X|4.0|I love the Dukan Diet and I do very well on it. There are several dishes I would never make but it gave good ideas.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My daughter loves this game.  She gets so excited and wants me to watch her play.  The graphics are great!  Thank you.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|You know when you just can't wait to watch a movie based on the reviews and how great its' supposed to be, the anticipation is impossible. Well, it was all true and well worth it!  I loved watching the film, the acting was brilliant, the plot amazing and the humanity so inspiring.  There was much to be learned from this well written movie with such fine acting, it is not only entertaining but enlightening and I highly recommend it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book and I ended up reading it in a couple of days.  I couldn't put it down.  The story of small town USA and all that is great about it.  Then the dangers and pitfalls of substance abuse.  Finally the perseverance of a man who had made so many wrong decisions but chose to push the limits and carry on.  At times the story almost is mythical in its telling as the author shares about the modifications he has to make due to losing use of his shooting hand and then an eye.  Just amazing to see the dedication to a calling to serve his country and a heart warming story of love.  This book truly describes a man who embraced its title, FEARLESS.
0307730697|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  It was a great true story.  I gave several as gifts to my friends and family.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Good quality video,great,great series.  Love this show-would recommend to anyone. It was reasonably priced and readily available.  I can't wait to see more!
B006I1OB0U|4.0|It is as advertised. The problem was myself. I wanted the version from England.<br />I didn't read well enough and wound up with the PBS version.
B008F9E306|5.0|Loved this album, I have many favorite tracks on it. I feel he kept it trendy bu at the same time with his own style!
B009CF7GRY|1.0|This film was pretty terrible. There was little dancing and the acting was abominable. Because of so much traffic on Amazon, we never got the HD verstion.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Fast action and great plot - one of the best of the new James Bond movies. I highly recommend watching this movie.
B00A77II0U|5.0|UNLIKE MANY OF THESE KINDS OF GAMES THE STORY IN THIS ONE WAS ACTUALLY WELL WRITTEN AND INTERESTING.  THERE WAS A GOOD BALANCE OF PUZZLES, FINDING THINGS AND DRAMA.
B004KPQK2S|4.0|good, movie, good story, appropriate for about every viewing audience.  I enjoyed the fact that this is an actual, true story, even though I know very little about the world of horse racing!
B00571F26Y|5.0|A must read for everyone! It is written with humor and a lot of research. We are off wheat and much healthier for it. Thanks Dr. Davis!
B0081336FO|5.0|The show manages to keep the feeling of the original stories while setting the characters in modern-day London.  Benedict Cumberbatch portrays a Sherlock Holmes who is the Muhammed Ali of detection: arrogant and yet the best that the world has ever seen.
0671646788|5.0|Bought a copy about ten years ago, lost it in my move and bought it again just recently. Read it it will improve your situation and help you get closer to your goal.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Highlight was Denzel's acting. a bit predictable, but overall good pace and well done. a good rental, I recommend it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Didn't think I'd like this show at first as i'm not much of a Zombie fan. Now I can't stop watching it!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Very good movie. It made you think and we even stopped it a few times to make sure we were understanding it correctly!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is really awesome and I once read it for one hundred forty five minutes because I just had to keep turning the page
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Black Box kept me reading and wanting to learn more about Harry Bosch and his cases! Well written and entertaining.
B0094K1WZE|1.0|This movie was looking pretty good but about half way throught the movie it got all choppy, then it froze.  It tried to come back a bunch of times but finally I gave up and just stopped watching it.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Mostly true to the book.  Actors were great and the cinematography beautiful! Very entertaining and well done.  Very Austen.  Enjoy!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Argo was decent up till the end when it deviated from the historical record into repeated Hollywood contrivance.  IMO, travesty is not a strong enough word for Argo winning Best Picture over Zero Dark Thirty and, in particular, Lincoln.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|James Bond saves the world but loses &#34;M&#34; in the process.  Great action and adventure as only Bond can do it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful cast!  Great script.  The costumes are beautiful.  It takes one to an era that we have only heard about.  My husband and I are hooked!
B001M3WPY8|5.0|Four generations of my family have loved this film.  I grew up watching it and I purchased it so that my children could grow up watching it.  Well they did and it was so loved that the disk had to be replaced by this purchase.  I started letting my son watch this at age five and at age eight it is still one of his favorites to pull off the shelf and watch over and over again.  Why?  Because the story line is engaging to both a young and older audience.  The costumes, action scenes, and characters are endearing. It is a film that teaches good moral values.  And there are just some absolutely classic scenes.  For example, when Prince Valient tries to escape his evil viking kidnappers how does he elude them?  By jumping into a large curtain of course!  Did he really do his own stunt work?  Because that was one terrific jump.  This is as classic as Errol Flynn in Robin Hood, but a better kept secret.  I highly recommend this film.  It wont disappoint.  At the end you'll be saying, &#34;Why can't they make movies like this anymore?&#34;
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show sucks you in with its incredible actors and entertaining storyline!!! If your a newbie start from season 1.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Best direction and acting I have ever seen for Ben Affleck.  If I didn't like him too much before; but with this movie, he convinced me how good he is.  Excellent performance, excellent quality, excellent history telling.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I wish I could rate this app more than 10 stars it is so good and it is very realistic.  I know because I am around horses everyday
B004WR125O|3.0|This is a very slow WiFi Dongle.  You would be better off using a direct connection.  If you must have wifi, then this will work, but be prepared for slow speeds even with Cable Internet.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is an exciting alien drama with great character portrayal by a great set of actors. The story line keep me connected from episode to episode wanting more and more.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|A beautifully produced and &#34;filmed&#34; series.  Wonderful attention to detail re period settings.  British humor and class that, from history read and family members own experiences, depicts with grace the differences and the likes of &#34;the classes&#34; in WW1 era Great Britain.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Excellent humor mixed with vivid description of the area.  Would recommend to anyone who wants to enjoy a read that is engaging but not so intense that it weighs you down mentally.  Nelson DeMille always entertains and The Panther holds true to that standard.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I love the Stephanie Plum novels they have everything a mystery novel should... Mystery, great characters, humour, Morelli and Ranger.
B003XT60KO|5.0|Don't bother taking a degree course in economics, just read this book it will teach you all you need to know.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie definitely met (and exceeded) my expectations. I was holding my breath the whole time. A really great thriller! Amazing that it was a true story!
B000JMLDCS|5.0|If you would like to refute any sort of modern skepticism or agnosticism, then you should read this book which serves as a strong case for the unconscious saving grace that is Christianity.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I could not down load app, problem someplace I do not think it was Amazon's fault. Will try  again when I can figure out the problem.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this as a gift and my step-mother was ecstatic! She loves this movie and now she has the movie and the soundtrack and a bunch of other goodies to go along with it. I recommend this for any SoM fan.
B0025X4OYI|3.0|When he made these he used the lush orchestral style that got radio play I guess in the 50s, but it isn't exactly country music.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent! The acting is phenomenal, characters are very well developed and actors suit their roles to a T! Bravo Maggie Smith.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I think everyone would benefit from this book, we take our time for granted, always rushing. After reading this book, I too will stop to smell the roses. Life after all , is comprised by seconds and we should appreciate and realize how precious they are.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|The 3D conversion was very well done. I didn't care for some of the film grain on some scenes, however the added depth was fantastic.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham can write . . . some humor in this one as well.<br /><br />He delivers . . . you may have your favorites, but they all are worth picking up.<br /><br />Read a Grisham 'wannabe' and you'll see the difference.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was an interesting, exhilarating read! I could not put the book down. There was an exciting new twist with every turn of the page
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|Dinah had a unique voice and delivery instantly recognizable.<br />Though often \\"poppy\\", generally she is an accomplished jazz singer.<br />Some of her great collaborations with Brook Benton appear here.<br />Listening to all the classic jazz singers, she and Nina Simone are my favorites perhaps.<br />She has a lighter touch than Nina however but consistently just swings in a way I find less generic than many of the other \\"torch\\" singers.<br />No one can have the tremendous range, expressiveness and supple vocal range of Nina.<br /><br />I just changed this review because like another reviewer, I thought there are no vocal transfers of Dinah's voice on the great album What a Difference a Day Makes, which is about one half of disc 3.<br />Then I found out it was the device I was using and it played fine on other cd/dvd players.<br />Strangely on another Dinah Washington compilation two or three songs from the same album were also absent on the same device but played fine on all the other ones I have.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This box set is awesome! Blu-ray discs, DVD discs and the ability to digitally download it. Of course I watch the Blu-ray discs, but it's nice to have the others because some of my family members who do not have cable TV or a Blu-ray player can borrow my DVD discs and enjoy the show. Season Two is great! Looking forward for season three to start. And of course it was awesome to buy this combo box set for $29.99. When I bought season one (Blu-ray discs only) last year I paid $39.99 after waiting for almost a year for the price to drop down from $69.99.  This time I did not have to wait at all to get a great price. Thanks HBO and Amazon!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have Yahoo Mail as a secondary mail account. I occasionally need to check my mail when I am using my kindle. This software makes it so easy to do just that.<br />Free APP which I would highly recommend.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Wonderful work! Enjoy it every time I watch. Everyone involved did a terrific job!<br /><br />The theme rings true for this world, also.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the show Downton Abbey! Streaming on my smart tv, the picture quality was quite good. There were no &#34;hiccups&#34; during the stream and amazon pride made it easy to find show.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a christmas gift, cause he wanted it for so long, and it was hard to find at the time.  Every other place that sold it had ridicuously high prices, amazon was the only one with a reasonable cost. He loved it, and it arrived very quickly, so he got it in time for Christmas, and this was ordered like the week of christmas!!!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|IT IS A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE GREAT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY, I T HAD ME IN TEARS FOR THE SAD PART AND IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I was skeptical about beginning to purchase these episodes because of some of the negative reviews. But I have to say I absolutely love it. Not only is the main character (Oliver Queen) ridiculously attractive, but the story line seems very well written and put together. I can't stop watching! Definitely worth it.
B000IMKDPC|3.0|I enjoyed this movie in theaters and recently re-watched it with a new eye. I offer this review to describe how this movie holds up ten years later.<br />Rogue/Wolverine:  I was presently surprised how effective the Rogue and Wolverine characters are. The movie introduction to both of these characters is captivating. Anna Paquin is charming as Rogue but doesn't quite have the Southern voluptousness Rogue usually is drawn to have in the comics. Hugh Jackman is also effective if maybe a little too Hollywood. The comic book Wolverine was much shorter and beastly. Jackman's got the persona down though.<br />Prof X/Magneto: Professor X and Magneto also have a strong introduction. Ian McKellen plays Magneto perfectly but he doesn't have the physical build that I imagined Magneto would have. I was especially disappointed in Magneto's helmet. It is an amazing aspect of Magneto's  costume but here it looks silly. It kinded reminded me of the first Spiderman. That early superhero movie also got the mask totally wrong for the villain green goblin. Patrick Stewart was an obvious choice for the professor so no problems there.<br />Cyclops/Jean: Cyclops is miscast. The actor who I now recognize from 30 Rock doesn't have the leadership persona or the physique to pull of Cyclops. For this reason Cyclop's confrontations with Wolverine don't carry any weight. No one can believe that this Cyclops can intimidate or hurt  Wolverine. His acting is a bit wooden too. Cyclops' headpiece is really large and clumsy. Ten years later its like seeing an old cell phone. Jean is well-cast and well-played. The actress playing her is appropriately beautiful and slightly vulnerable.<br />Storm/Sabretooth/Toad:  Halle Berry is not utilized well as Storm. She doesn't play the character that great anyway. Her African accent comes and goes and actually sounds sillly when you do hear it. Her character wasn't impressive and could have been left out I think. Sabretooth and Toad are poor villains. Their costumes are not very effective. Sabretooth doesn't have the presence he should. His costume and makeup don't impress. Its also never explained what his powers are. He is stabbed directly by Wolverine but doesn't even appear to be hurt. Toad';s costume is also not impressive. His green makeup looks really b-movie.<br />Storyline: The movie did a good job with the backstories of Magneto, Wolvie, and Rogue. Why didn't they introduce the rest? That would have made the movie more effective. There are so many brilliant storylines in the x-men cannon that I wonder why they chose this one about Magneto turning Senator Kelly/worldleaders into mutants. Overall it doesn't hold up that well.<br /><br />Despite this, the movie holds up ok ten years later. It has the makings of a a great movie but makes a few too many missteps to make it worth watching more than once.
B001VFTYWI|3.0|Much more dialog than activity.  Reading it is like watching paint dry.  I keep waiting for some motion, action, anything.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is definitely recommended for mature audiences it made me happy in some parts losses off in others so sad and brought tears to my eyes in others and then irritated I definitely recommend this book!! My aunt recommended it to and I never wanted to read it but glad I did can't wait to read the other books!!!
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|If you are not familiar with this artist you are adrift. This is another excellent effort and affords a nice mix<br />of his eclectic song-writing. Nothing needs to be said about the performance as it is stellar and puts to<br />shame the many anointed &#34;guitar gods&#34; out there. This is the real deal.
B007R0WHMK|4.0|I REALLLY LIKE THAN IT GOT CRAZY AT THE END, SO I WAS LIKE WOW IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING BUT OTHE THAN THAT IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Poor plot, lack of scenery, depressing story line, What happened to all the exotic locales, the spy toys, and action, action, action!
B00881VLCE|2.0|I really wanted to.play this app, but  Avg called it intrusive adware. Please fix! Why do you have to place adware? Uninstalled until it is fixed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE this game, it is the only one I play and I am totally not a gamer.  Saw it on the news and tried it, it's amazing.  And free, who can believe it?!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is beautiful and rich, a wonderful read for people of all ages. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|The WHO were arguably firing on all cylinders at the stage of their career and this long buried live performance helps make the argument. OUTSTANDING performance and remember this incredible noise is being generated by four guys in a City Hall. Turn it all the way up and enjoy!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Not usually what I would read but I enjoyed it. It really makes you think about life. Everyone should read it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was a good way of ending this series. I look forward to reading the next series. The heroes of Olympia series.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app so much fun i play for hours can't get enough good stress relief too helps me very a awesome app i think everyone should play it .SO MUCH FUN
B00B2166BS|5.0|I just love saying pogo. More than that, I love using this little guy to charge my N10. This thing looks like OEM, and acts like it too.<br />The magnets snap it right into place and hold it securely enough that it doesn't just flop off, but breaks away well before your precious is jerked to the floor by a rampaging dog or toddler.<br />It will also charge much faster than the standard USB charger. I installed Battery Monitor Widget and observed the rates using the stock USB and the pogo. I get overall an hour plus faster charge with the pogo than not and best of all, I can still get a net charge with it during use. The best the USB could do was slow down the discharge.<br />Bottom line, want to save your USB port and charge quickly, get this guy. If you use a case, make sure it has the cut out along the bottom.<br />My only beef is why didn't Samsung/Google include this with the tablet?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was simply amazing. So many feelings I acquired through reading it, it was as perfect as it could ever be. John Green is a one of a kind writer.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Does what is should.  Time has been within a minute for the past three weeks.<br />Does not have a battery to die and replace!<br />.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Resolution of the graphics have improved from the first Temple Run but the graphics are a bit glitchy on the Kindle. The ground would spaz out occationally.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was phenomenal. It kept our attention the entire time.<br /><br />Ben Affleck was definitely on his a-game for this film, I will definitely watch it again
B00B935SUY|5.0|Must see for any fan of great music from 1970 to today. Dave Grohl did a masterful job with this
B005Q1W10A|5.0|If you haven't heard about how fantastic this show is, you're missing out! With regards to the product specifically--it's great DVD plus digital copy (I especially like the digital copy so I can upload to my various smart devices that don't permit DVD usage e.g. iPad).
B008M7JODC|5.0|Some corny parts, but hey-still really good.  Mad scientist Walter is pretty funny. Give it a look, you wont regret it
B002WTOXUK|4.0|For a change of pace, this is a good choice for science fiction fans.  This movie creates a scenario that is imaginative, but also sheds light on the human condition, fulfilling the potential of all good science fiction.
0345803485|1.0|Geez! What's all the hype about?? Absolutely nothing happened! This is like soft-core-faux-porn for housewives that had a herd of babies in their 20's instead of exploring and discovering who their sexual selves are (in a healthy and safe way of course!!) I forced myself to finish just so that I could give it an honest review and in the hopes of getting to some &#34;meat&#34; (no pun intended) and finding that I was compelled to read the next in the series...... But nope! That definitely did not happen!<br />Additionally, I am forgiving of first-time published authors, however, there was so much ramble, so much unnecessary detail (and none at all where it counts) and repetition of adjectives often on the same page that I'd be hard pressed to even consider reading this author in the future.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Buying the second one now!!!! It was a great book I can't wait to finish the next  two! So excited great work E.L.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Argo was a bit of history with drama. It was a nice change. It was believable and I enjoyed it.
0316286850|5.0|This book is awesome has a lof of good techniques and teaches you in an easy way. I love it.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Although this book is well written and researched it was much too hard to read about the subject matter. I had to force my way through it as it was a book club book. However it is very topical and thought provoking
1591840562|4.0|This book made me jot down several notes and really think - which means it definitely was worth the read.  I've ready dozens of business-related books, and this one still had some nice unique points included in it.
B008VVT51U|5.0|I liked all the actors in this show. They were funny, sad and veery realistic. Judy Dench's character's reflections with many life lessons. There was something for everyone . The realities of aging and the challenges were well presented as we'll as showing even the older people have something to offer.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  the cast did a great job of making the film look great. i would reccomend this for all friends.  thanks barbara
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I LIKE HISTORICAL FICTION AND THIS STORY WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR A LONG TIME.  I READ THE BOOK IN 2 DAYS
B00APJLX8E|3.0|Overall this was a cute kids movie with some funny parts.  Certainly not of Pixar / Dreamworks caliber, but enjoyable in general.
0545265355|5.0|I was glad to have bought this as a boxed set for my son. When I sat down and read the first one, as soon as I had it finished, I was reading the next one. Worth reading, no matter how old you are.
0345529057|5.0|You've seen one of those movies or read one of those books where the protagonist barely escapes with their lives at the end and goes on to live happily ever after.  This is not one of those books...  Martin introduces you to a plethora of characters that you will fall in love with.  By the end of Book 5, you will be scared to attach yourself, You never know who's going to die.  There are two major plot lines.  One revolves around the battle for the throne, the other focuses on the soon-to-be battle against supernatural beings from the north.<br /><br />Martin can be vulgar and sometimes ADD, but you will love the series.  Better than LOTR series, in my opinion.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Tried this game and was really disappointed. Keep getting errors and lock-ups. I finally deleted it and glad I did.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Title says it all.  He doesn't have the pipes to sing this music, they had to dumb down what he does sing.  It ruined the entire movie for me.  I give it 2 stars for the look of the movie, which I thought was spot on.  Hugh Jackman does a fantastic job of ACTING the part, but also doesn't have the voice to do it justice.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Was more than I ever expected from a book. It was like  I was living in the town and walking beside  each character. The tears flooded several times. Didn't want it to end
B009VB998I|4.0|Rented this movie while my nieces were staying with us over the holidays.  The youngest (6) picked the movie, but it was enjoyed by the 12 year old as well.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Not a big Linkin Park fan. However, I really love this cd. I usually listen to the whole thing, with the exception of one track. My son and I both tend to sing along to it.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|I saw Mr Burdon countless times around So Cal mid 70's - mid 80's along with a sparse sprinkling of shows 90's and 00's. There are alot of woulda coulda shouldas mid's 70's - mid 80's but I hung my hat on Mr Burdon and Mr Pop. Frankly, at this late date, I had given up hope of ever hearing anything relevant from either at this point. Well, Mr Burdon has come up with a truely marvelous effort. This lp hits all my (good) Eric buttons. A laid back blues with just the right rocking touch from a wizard waving his wand. Listening to this cd only leads to good , but not necessarily better things. Little Feat Rooster Rag, Eric Clapton 461 Ocean Blvd. If you like that line up you'll love this. Now. If only Iggy and The Stooges Ready To Die 2013 lp lives up to these standards I'll be ready to, well...die. Great cd.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I really enjoy reading this book and thought it very appropriate reading in this state of world affairs. In fact current news this sort of cypperware has already commenced.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I loved playing BTD 4 but now I love BTD 5 even more. soooo much new towers. I love it so much.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|Rescue Roby is a lot of fun for kids and adults!  It is a great physics type game with fantastic graphics. The lite version lets you play about half of the game. I decided I just had to have the full version so I could play all of the levels!  My kids and I really enjoy figuring out how to get Roby to his box!  I highly recommend this one!
B00005Y1UX|5.0|Bought as a gift for a friend.<br />Greatly appreciated by friend and no issues with playing or quality of picture, just perfect.
B003L77FYS|5.0|My mother loves this show. My son loves this show. This is a series that just keeps getting better with each and every episode.
B000002H92|5.0|Jim and the boys on a very good night-and there were a few ordinary ones along the way! I believe the Doors actually rehearsed for this concert-and it shows! At their best, one of rock's most daring and innovative combos and they certainly came to play here!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|All that Mr. Bocelli has done, has met my<br />expectations. This album is no different. I<br />recomend this album to all who Love someone,<br />and to all who Love music. I give it a 5 star rating.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This site is usually pretty accurate and gives a full forecast.  I've tried several other weather apps but none of them were as accurate nor had the graphics of this app. Love it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Not spellbinding but, very good and certainly up to date with what is happening around the world in our times.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I do not buy music at all, but as i really enjoy MJ I bought Thriller to put on my tablet. It was a great move on my part as this music is fantastic.
B00B2EWNWG|4.0|This movie may not have the greatest story, but man does it have some great action in it! The action alone is what kept me watching this movie. The overall story of the movie was a little cheesy, and didn't really come off as that great to me personally, but the action makes the film entertaining to watch, and worth the time.
B000026C3T|5.0|Led Zeppelin have long been categorised-wrongly-as maybe the pre-eminent heavy rock outfit. They were considerably more than that as this excellent collection demonstrates. Lots of light and shade. Heavy rockers interspersed with almost delicate ballads. Simply brilliant!
B0016LTNL4|5.0|Truly funny with some very endearing characters. The whole family loved it, but not recommended for kids younger than 12.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Awesome film, highly recommend!<br /><br />Some of the acting is a little rough at times, however, the b-grade charm more than makes up for it.
B008Y73940|5.0|It's McConaughey.  Great plot, and just when you think it's over....BAM...there's alot more to it.  May start a little slow for you, but just give it time.
B005PK56TA|4.0|A little strange but definitely keeps your interest.  Shame only Season 1 is on Prime.  I would definitely recommend to others.
B009SQOGZ2|4.0|Paranorman is a film that is enjoyable for all ages due to its child like sense of humor which is more meant for the children, and then there is the actual story of the film, which is more centered for teenagers, and adults. Another thing I noticed while watching this film, is that it seems to be a &#34;Silent Hill For Kids&#34; due to a few similarities I found (Little girl that was accused of being a witch, and burned, and is now taking out her revenge on the people of the town and the people who hurt her ; takes place in a small town with a small population of people ; only 1 person can relate to the witch and stop the terrible madness ; and the little girl is dressed in a school-girl type uniform)
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|It's kind of fun. But left a lot of questions open. Still fun for sci-fi fans. It needed more character developement.
B005DNO7MQ|2.0|ugh, I fell asleep at the theater when I saw this and when I watched it at home with my kids, it was just as bad. We were all bored out of our minds and these were teenage boys who were watching with me. I really thought they would dig the violence, but they said it was too much of the same thing over and over and the story was not good enough to keep their interests.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Great entertainment!!<br /><br />Best of the MI movies so far.  This one adds a lot of humor.  The MI crew that backs up Cruise looks like the second string team but perform well and are entertaining.  They have personalities.<br /><br />Movie looks great on mobile device.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B001EC3JME|5.0|i did not get this to hold a flashlight, i got it to hold my epipen, this is the first time i found a product that could be used for more than what it was originally designed for, they really should call it a multi-holster, so if there is anyone else out there reading this and you use an epipen and hate that your pockets on your pants always get holes in the pockets from carry the epipen here is something you can use without ruining your pants
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a basic calculator for my Kindle. Calculator Plus Free more than met my requirements and expectations. A must have.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book changed my life...<br />Since I went of wheat products I have these changes.<br />1. Lowered blood presure<br />2. Lost weight, 10 pounds in four weeks<br />3. I'm not diabetic anymore<br />4. Stopped my meds for acid reflux<br />5. Cholesterol levels are now normal and high like they were<br />6. Lost the belly-bump weight<br /><br />All-in-all I feel so much better
B002ZG980U|5.0|Wow! What a sleeper movie. Not put you to sleep but probably not well known. The cast does a great job. I did not find it as hard to follow as I thought. It's gone to head of the list of my current favorites. Similar to the old movie Dreamscape but far more detailed and much more drama and action.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I absolutely love these newer Doctor Who seasons/episodes. I &#34;forced&#34; my boys to watch one episode with me and they were immediately hooked. Absolutely appropriate for kids, although some episodes might be a little scary for little ones, depending on their sensitivity. The writing and acting are amazing.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was well written and very appealing...I couldn't put it down after I started reading it .  I loved it
B00BESLHEA|1.0|I chose the 1 star rating because the movie consisted of clich&eacute; moments and had too much weird sexual preferences.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|One of the best produced, most well acted series of the last several years. Dramatic, funny, Downton Abbey has something for everyone.
B00007KQA3|5.0|It arrived before scheduele.<br />Excelent quality,begaining of movie confussing unless you read the book.<br />Highly recommend.I don't think it should be veiwed by children.
0061780308|5.0|Wonderful story that could only be told by a dog.  Wanted to share with my teen and now can as the &#34;kid rated&#34; version is  out, &#34;Racing in the Rain - My life as a Dog&#34;
0316777722|5.0|David Sedaris is one of my favorite authors, so i was disappointed in myself that i did not buy this book sooner. A great read, good condition.
B000I3PERS|5.0|This is a great flick about the strengths and weaknesses of men. This is funny and deadly serious at the same time. Good choice for an action movie.
1933865474|5.0|BT has compiled a visual array of beauty and art into an amazingly detailed and artistically precise book of work here. I find his work to be nostaligic yet modern in color and presentation. I loved seeing the famous renditions of movie posters and theater sets, a grand visual for the art afficionado. I look forward to whatever else I can find on his level.
B008Q08QXE|5.0|I love Jimmy Steward. My being a Prime member has been the best investment I've made in a long time. It allows me to see a lot of the old classic movies free!
B008B3GP2A|4.0|I really enjoy this album. &#34;Sad&#34; is my favorite off the album, Adam Levine's voice during it is so raw and emotional, and the piano part is beautiful. Definitely worth the purchase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addictive once you start playing.  I enjoy playing this game in competition with my granddaughter.  I use this play time to help with my vision and it's a very colorful way to train your brain &  keep it healthy. Thanks for a really good product & I look forward to more games from this company.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love how this app lets you mix sounds! We use the night, urban rain, and thunder and it sounds like a Midwest summer night all the time!
B008133MDK|5.0|Awesome show. Great writing. Can't wait for season 3. It's a real cliffhanger at the end of season 2. Highly Recomm
1582406634|3.0|Though an avid appreciation for the female form and lover of fine art, I was expecting more of a collection of drawings on this. What I got was a sketchpad of various drawings and works of females in different styles. Not bad in the sense but dissapointing. Though this guy Cho can draw his you-know-what off it was entirely in black and white.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.  I had a hard time putting it down, great read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think you well love this game it is awesome I play it so much more than I play with my friend
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|A fun story with a few twists.  At first I was disappointed that Miles was such a small part of this story, but in the end, Ivan carried the story well on his own.  The only quirk is that I would not recommend it for anyone who is not familiar with the Vorkosigan universe.  Prior knowledge of the characters is required for maximum enjoyment.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Once again excellent combination of science and exitement. Really like book by Dan Brown! Can't wait to get more from him.
B00A2JTEHY|4.0|There are some good things in this box with exception of the Levine Hollander, the  Lohengrin and the partially dreadful Keilberth Meistersinger.<br /><br /> The Hollander has a aged, tired, and not very involved Dutchman of Morris as well as Levine whose conducting made me feel like I had been listening to this recording for seven years. The Lohengrin has let's-get-it-over-with conducting from Leinsdorf and an Elsa who is totally lost with what her character is even remotely about. Rumor has it that the recording was scheduled for Leontyne Price and Jussi Bjoerling prior the tenor's death in 1960.<br /><br />And finally, a Meistersinger with a nasal, off-pitch, dry-voiced Hans Sach(Weiner) and a Pogner (Hotter) suffering from the flu. If that doesn't chase you away nothing will. Even Keilberth was off that night. Too bad since the recording is so wonderfully engineered. Like being there. Wish Weiner and Hotter weren't.<br /><br /> Note that all negative mentions are leading characters and conductors. A big factor in choosing a good recording.<br /><br /> The Parsifal is in mono but don't let that put you off. It is a grand 'live' recording with two singers as Kundry. The 1st Act, the first part of Act 2 and 3rd Act have Elisabeth Hongen (the poorly dressed Kundry)and the rest of Act Two (the major portion of Kundry's role and the high-heeled Kundry) was taken by the fantastic Christa Ludwig. Her performance alone makes this recording a valuable addition to any serious Wagner collection.<br /><br />I figure von Karajan felt the last of the 2nd Act should be special with a fresh-voiced Ludwig...then why not change the tenor as well? Fritz Uhl, the Parsifal, puts a damper on the proceedings but he is still fairly good. Hotter is pretty good but over acts much of the time.For some reason I prefer this version to von Karajan's glossy digital production on DG although I give a big thumbs-up to Moll's Gurnemanz. The sound is still iffy but worth a listen. The voices are forward and the orchestra recessed. Much like an early fifties studio mono recording.<br /><br />Although I'm a little weary of the Walkure Act 1 and Hoffmann recital, the rest of this package has some great stuff. The Melchior/Traubel/Flagstad/Farrell excerpts are most welcome as are the orchestral selections. You get some of the greatest Wagner conducting EVER. A true demonstration of what Wagner is all about. All Grand Wagner. Wagner as never heard since.<br /><br />The good outweighs the bad in this set so it is recommended although many dedicated Wagnerite's will have these in their collection already.orward and the orchestra recessed.

B007RI56NY|4.0|Great album.  I love their lyrics with their use of puns and just overall funniness.  Their lyrical style is quiet unique and I love listening to the lyrics (50 Ways to Say Goodbye, by far the best).  I don't get all these, \\"They've changed\\" comments.  I have been fans of Train for nearly 15 years.  Yes, their music has changed.  Who hasn't changed (even a little)in 15 years? I think Train has grown to be a fan of music and this album shows what is influencing them now. They seem to be enjoying their music making right now and that is very honorable and notable and what we should ask for any artist.  If we don't like the product, we move on.  Maybe they will one day revisit a style they've tried or maybe they will go a completely different direction.  Maybe I will listen, maybe I will not.
082300659X|5.0|One should probably get an instructor prior to this, or instead of this. Although, I have bought this book in addition to others to try and supplement the fact that I am unable to get a great mentor at the moment. With that being said, and the price of this book, it is definitely a great deal. The author provides an abundant amount of introductory information to instigate a more thorough investigation of the subject matter, yet at the same time it is a substantial amount to be considered enough to get the ball rolling without adding to the study. It would be a good idea to supplement, but she does give a great means to approach and focus on exercises that are of the utmost importance to the beginning Fine art student. The pictures are of high quality and she writes as if she would be approachable to help or further one's interest in the area.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The bible app is amazing. You can share verses, search, find live events nearby,<br />The bible app by you version is amazing.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|You can recommend a movie and someone has to decide if they like it or not but when ordering movies highly consider buying from goHastings!!!  I refuse to buy from anyone else unless goHastings does not have the movie which is very rare.  They send out your purchase right away & I always get it within a 2-3 days & the product itself is perfect.  Cases & movies are always great.  I have ordered so much from goHastings & I have yet had an issue w/a movie.  GoHastings.......  Is the only way.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Loved this just as much as the first part of the mini series.  Character development was beautiful.  Only problem is it ended...would have loved to follow these characters lives on and on.....
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What an amazing humble individual...Family man...Brother in arms...Nerves of steel...Such a great loss that he died after going thru everything that he did...To say he was a true American hero is an understatement...2 Silver stars...5 bronze stars...over 160 confirmed sniper kills...4 combat tours...Wow!!!...May he rest in peace...After all of his service he died helping a veteran suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome...What a loss...Please pray for his Wife and children...I wish I could have met Chris and thanked him for his selfless service...It seems the good do die young...He has touched so many people...Thank you Chris.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have played this on my ipod touch and I have not played my kindle fire in a long time. the last time I played my kindle they didn't have temple run this game is addicting
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|It's a good continuation of the story.  Lots of suspense and room for growth into the next season.  Maggie Smith is as good as ever.  What an actress!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|One of Denzel Washington best acting role. You found yourself telling him don't do it. Toward the end the truth set him free.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Whole days were spent watching this show. The Tudors is the first series I've watched from start to finish. It is good stuff.
B0014NDXGA|2.0|The rangefinder takes too much time and often is not able to acquire target.  A buddy has a much cheaper GPS watch that works well.  When I pick up the rangefinder he usually just tells me what his GPS says rather than waiting on me to get rangefinder results.  I would not purchase this product again.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I adore Gideon and Eva -- what wonderfully written damaged and loveable characters.  I have pre-ordered Entwined with You -- can't wait.  Thank you Sylvia for the Crossfire series.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|Abrahms is a poo-flinging monkey hack of a writer that has screwed up every idea his crack addled ADD brain has ever discharged, and I love Trek. So I really expected to hate this movie. I didn't.<br /><br />If you read the one star reviews you'll get a sense of all of the plot holes that could have been avoided if JJ bothered to watch some Star Trek or sucked less. They are real and it's a shame there are so many of them.<br /><br />But the movie, despite it's faults, is not just watchable but fun. The characters should not be meeting the way they do, but every one of them is cast well and does a great job and are pretty consistent with the old Trek cast. The action is great, the way they are gathered around finalizing the assault on the Romulan mining ship and then execute is, it works. I came away not just satisfied but thinking it was in the top 4 of the movie series. Upon second watch I still think it's fun but there's too many inconsistencies. Maybe top 6.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|1,000 times better than a real notebook, and easy to keep yourself organized. I love uploading audio and pictures onto my notes for optimal understanding. It's especially nice to take notes at school and then print off a hard copy at home.
B000002NAK|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals, and I had to have a CD copy for the car.  Nothing eats away the miles on the Interstate like listening to it.  Plus, I had no idea Antonio Banderas could sing!  (You learn something new every day!)
B00005JLEU|5.0|Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service were okay, but this one's defiantly my favorite. It's got that Alice in Wonderland concept that I love so much, as well as a little bit of Aesop's Fables. Chihiro learns to find herself among the kami and youkai of the spirit world. I also LOVE the heavy influence of Japanese culture.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was like every other one of his books (which I LOVE!) It was full of romance, and distress, and hapiness and sadness. I have known another author who captures such emotions in a book so short.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Very fun, challenging, a great way to burn a few minutes here and there. It's better than Mahjong, in my opinion, which was my favorite matching puzzle game until I for this as the free app of the day from the Amazon market. Definitely would have been worth paying for, though, so even better to have gotten it free. I may not have ever played it if it wasn't on there
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Not the best book he's ever written, but very typical Nicholas Sparks.  Quick and easy read....definitely better than the movie!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A film not to be missed.  Cudos to Ben Affleck!  A story that needs to be told.  Watch it today.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|If you don't like it your crazy ok so it adds 3 more people Jason the son of Jupiter ,piper daughter of Aphrodite Leo theson the of hephaestus
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This story gives some interesting political insights that can be equated to some of what is going on in our our societies. It rates up there with &#34;Brave new World&#34; and &#34;1984&#34;
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this years ago and re-read it recently.  How is it that authors and stories like this are not required reading at all levels of education?
0071766588|5.0|It is about TOEFL in detail. Every one can benefit for the three exercises it contains.<br /><br />The more you do not know TOEFL, the more you need it. This one open the door of TOEFL for you. Even if you are really good at English, you still need it to see what TOEFL is really like.<br /><br />If you only need one book for TOEFL, this one is it.
B007N85POS|5.0|This is probably my favorite Angry Birds version.  The levels are challenging but not so hard that I give up.  I also love that it follows a story line and I love the monkeys.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey had me hooked from the first episode. The life between the very rich and the servants is so educational. I love the acting and think the casting is excellent. I also love the scenery of old England.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Lots of fun. Pretty challenging, but not too hard. The graphics look pretty good, and the game moves fast. Definatly recomend!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I rate these books with &#34;Brave New World&#34; and &#34;1984&#34;. There is an insightful look into how societies can be maneuvered for political goals. And the books are a good read.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|I have a generic Android that that this still works great on.  I purchased a Kindle HD 8&middot;9 and most of the screens are a patchwork of various colors and not the picture that's supposed to be there!  All other apps are fine, except this one!
B007PFDJH4|5.0|Haven't read such good book since &#34;Lost Memory of the Skin&#34;. Very witty. Good description of 1970 England. Characters well described.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|This is by far the best video player for Android. I love that it uses your device's built in codecs when they exist, but that it will also fall back to using its own software codecs. This ensures it can play virtually any file.<br /><br />But the thing that is truly awesome with this player is the controls. Swipe up/down to control volume and brightness. Swipe left and right to skip ahead and back through the video! Why does no other player have this feature?? It is so incredibly useful and user friendly, all other media players should be ashamed. I'm looking at you, youtube app, and you, music players!
1616550414|5.0|I've been a fan of the Zelda series since the NES days. When I saw this available for pre-order, I didn't hesitate. I was not disappointed. It has tons of information and art to please any Zelda fan. Sure, some games didn't receive as much coverage as I'd like, but you can't beat the price for this amount of content. A great addition to my collection of video game related stuff.
B000I9U99K|4.0|Has the makings of a classic movie. Give it several more years and the movie will be one. Great ocean shots.
B00742GBDM|5.0|Very nice movie for the romantic at heart, I always wanted to own it to watch on those night that there is nothing on cable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If this series had a 10 star rating, it wouldn't be enough.  Wish there were more episodes in a season series.  Love looking into the lives of the elite and their staff.  Very well written.  Kudos to British television.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Awesome flick, i enjoyed it from start to finish.  Anyone old enough to remember arcades will love this movie.  Thanks.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|Great Flick. It was never intended to be exactly the same as the original, yet it took some of the old and made it new... Loved it
B00ADS98FC|5.0|what is not to love about this movie? it's like mean girls and glee combined. we really enjoyed this film! i really wish amazon would give you the option purchase this movie right after you rent it for the difference in cost (for instance if i paid $4 to rent this and the movie cost $12 to buy - after I rent it if amazon allowed me to buy for the additional $8). i think i would do that often!
B00000JNJ1|5.0|How funky can some young white boys from Britain get? If you spin these tracks you'll get closer to the answer.
B00BLHTPT8|5.0|I'm a huge Castle fan, as such this review is already biased.  That being said, this episode (as well as the one before it \\"Target\\") is amazing.  \\"Hunt\\" plays out like a full length feature film in just under one hour.  The story is engrossing, the characters are colorful, the acting is phenomenal all around.  All involved with the making of the show (which has been consistently good all season) should be very proud of this episode.  I watched this episode twice and was on the edge of my seat both times.  The only drawback to such a great episode is that the bar has been set so high, the remaining episodes may not be able to reach.  However, I liken Castle to doughnuts and pizza.  There's never a bad one, just varying levels of good.  I can't wait to see what the rest of season 5 has in store.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It is an engaging read about a subject that is pretty topical at this point in time.  You won't be disappointed.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|The TNG-R effort has been amazing. Although this season was handled by an outside sfx agency (other than CBS Digital) it is still a worthy purchase to see the Ent-D and her crew in beautiful 1080p. Highly recommended!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|The first month or so and then it gets kind of boring and repetitive.The upgrades and boards are cool and the upgrades are pretty cool for about 30 days and then.....DONT GET ME WRONG,its a good game,but may not have a lasting appears to some people like me.
B00BHMF578|5.0|good quality download from amazon - we had one short streaming issue but was quickly resolved! i would recommend watching this movie on amazon :)
B000W93CHC|4.0|I always enjoy Ken Follett's historical fiction. It always brings up interesting facts about a period in time that bring it to life. This was not my favorite book of his, however. I found no truly likeable characters and found myself annoyed at even to protagonists.
B00138CZIS|5.0|Loved this album since first time I heard it.  System of a Down never ceases to surprise me with their guitar riffs, drum beats and vocals.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|My daughter (who is 12) read this series and recommended it to me.  She and I share a love of fantasy / sf novels, and we often trade books back and forth.<br /><br />I thought this series would be a bit juvenile, and yes, it is definitely targeted for teens.  However, it is also well written and entertaining, with some fascinating concepts centered around a dystopian-but-hopeful future society.  If you are a fan of light science fiction, dystopian fiction, or &#34;futures imperfect&#34; type stories, you will enjoy it I think.  It's a quick read and a real page-turner.<br /><br />This is the first book in the series, and was my second-favorite (I liked &#34;Pretties&#34;, the second novel, better.)  Enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it........I cannot say enough about this show.  I love the way the upstairs and downstairs characters are so interwined.  The clothing is beautiful as well as the decor of that era.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Walter steals the show!Exciting and engrossing. X Files meets lost. J.J. Abrams magic box concept in action. Stand alone episodes with an over arching story line beneath.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|i really wish amazon would give you the option purchase this movie right after you rent it for the difference in cost (for instance if i paid $4 to rent this and the movie cost $12 to buy - after I rent it if amazon allowed me to buy for the additional $8). i think i would do that often! other than that, i really enjoyed this film.
0345803485|5.0|this was really racy for my tastes but it was still a good book. it read smoothly, and can not wait to read the next one.
0634022296|4.0|This book is by far the best I have come across for guitarists and singers who want to quickly play Beatles songs, and play them well. The chords and keys are written as recorded. An excellent resource. All of the songs are displayed on two facing pages, so there is no need to turn the page (if you can keep it open...more on that below). This book provides a simple, accurate and quick reference for playing these songs, but as with all music, if you want to learn the finer nuances and subtleties of the songs, careful listening is required. But the book on its own really does get you quite far.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this is a great book, the publisher would do well to release any future pressings of this book with a spiral spine. It just won't stay open without putting something heavy on top of it that blocks the words and chords from view and eventually destroys the spine. A friend has a copy of this book with the inevitably destroyed spine, so that many pages have started to fall out. Mine is new, and I plan to take it to Staples and pay the $7 or so to have them convert it to a spiral binding. If it weren't for the spine issue, I would have given this book 5 stars.
0385341008|5.0|When I finished reading this book ...I continued to think about the characters and wish them well. I would recommend this book to readers that like people...and appreciate interpersonal relationships.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Worth the money and a great DVD. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a classic!
B000007XUQ|5.0|There's not  much I can say.  This is the most valuable addition to my Christmas music collection I've made in years.  I love the Carpenters.  Richard was so talented on piano and in song arrangements. Karen was a wonderful singer whose voice grew even more mellow as she got a few years older.  The two were perfectionists.  And the result is perhaps the best collection of Christmas music of their era.  To think that Karen passed so young gives an extra touch of meaning to the music, and the nostalgic sadness that hits anyone with a heart as he listens to her signature Christmas songs, brings a melancholy to this writer makes words insufficient to convery what he--I--want to say. God bless Karen and her brother. And you, dear reader, owe it to yourself to own this 2 CD album. Amen.
B00445RHKI|5.0|i own both season 1 and 2 and plan to buy the additional seasons. this comedy never gets old and is a joy to have on my kindle fire. long plane rides go by quickly with this as company!
B008M7JODC|5.0|This is an awesome show! The mix of mystery, science, comedy, and the unknown brings what x-files used to be-to the next level! I can't wait to start season 2!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|having his wife contribute and write her viewpoint was a master stroke !!<br />Heroism and Sacrifice<br />This is a MUST READ
B004EPZ084|4.0|Pretty funny but not hilarous. Definitely has its moments but I should have purchased a different comedy that I would want to watch more often.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|If you are like me and like the feel of holding a thin Kindle unencumbered by a case, then you are going to want a slip case to protect your Kindle. The Timbuk2 Ballistic Envelope Sleeve is the perfect slip case. The Kindle (Paperwhite) slides into the case easily, but securely. The Velcro closure is well made and I have little doubt that it will withstand thousands of opennings. The interior is well lined to protect your screen. I haven't (fortunately) dropped my Kindle, but I know if I do and it is in this slip case, it will come out unscathed. I recommend this product without reservation.
B004I4H8QI|4.0|Great album, Layla (original version), Key to the Highway Blues, more great music.  Bought as a gift for me Da who called me asking who did this &#34;song about a highway and keys, long song&#34;.  As an aside, a Satellite radio for an older parents (70+) vehicle will lead to many of these types of calls at odd hours of the night.  Clapton never changes, always great music, Me Da calls me every time Key to the Highway comes on!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Totally on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. Super well made and very touching in all its aspects.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was such a great find, I loved it from the beginning to the end! Likeable characters, great story, Highly recommend this to anyone!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great movie! Acting was the best, powerful performances. Shows the destruction that affects people that are addicted, and the fact that it can happen to any of us.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|This is a great movie, especially for men who grew up watching Clint Eastwood and want to see him continuing to be a bad ass.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show is so enjoyable. I can't stop watching it. Don't know how I didn't realize what a great show this is at a much earlier date. I will not miss one episode. Fantastic drama and fabulous acting by the entire cast!!! AAA++++ RATING IN MY BOOK!!
B007FQDPL8|4.0|True Blood is definitely different.  This being the first season, leaves you waiting for the release of the next season to answer the unanswered question of Sookie Stackhouses' abilities and where they come from.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its good to pass time by but gets boring after some weeks.They should add more action to it.you easily know what comes next.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Perhaps I don't have feelings, but this was a silly love story trying deperately to be deep. I only read it because I had to for a book club.
B000I9UA8U|5.0|Whenever I need a mood-boost this is one of my go-to films. Hilarious, warm, real - and I never get enough of the accents. A treasure.
B002WY65VU|5.0|We died laughing watching this comedy and came back to life to watch it again. Get it? Because it is a zombie comedy? Zombies are people that have died and then come back to life and then eat other people who then become zombies. It's a joke. Just buy the movie and watch it.
0790742780|5.0|For the longest time I have wanted to review this movie. I thought what better time than on the 20th anniversery of this movie & plus how this movie is relevent right now. Cause if you remember in my 20 years ago Bad Lieutenant review I said that this movie is still relevant & for Falling Down even more so. This movie deals with a man that likely has some kind of mental issues along with the kind of stuff that's been going on in the news the past few months. Falling Down is just as relevant as it was in 1993. Directed by Joel Schumacher now I know he gets hated on a lot but I think that Joel Schumacher is pretty good director. Cause I like A Time To Kill The Lost Boys, The Client & Batman Forever. Anyway the movie stars Michael Douglas as Bill Foster who goes by D Fens through out the movie. Robert Duvall as Sergeant Prendergast & Rachael Ticotin as Detective Sandra Torres. The story is you start off with this  man named Bill Foster a man who worked as a Defense Contracter & had been recently fired or laid off from his job. He's stuck in a traffic jam & it's a hot day the Air Condintioner won't work in his car he just gets out & decides to walk home. Also a another man who is stuck in traffic is Sergeant Pendergast who is going to The Police Office it's his last day on the job. Anyway Foster calls his Ex Wife & tells her that he's coming home for their Daughter's Birthday. His wife has a restraining order against him not to be near them or their home. The Police keep telling her that he won't show. You have Foster go to a Convince Store cause he needs some change to use The Pay Phone he is told to buy something by the owner played by Paul Michael Chan & he gets a can of soda the shop keep tells him 85 cents. That makes mad cause he needs the change for The Pay Phone. The owner says \\"Eighty fie cin you pay or go!\\" Foster asks if they have v's in China. The shop owner says that he is not Chinese he's Korean. Foster asks \\"Do you know how much money my country gives yours?\\" Shop Owner:\\"How much?\\" Foster:\\"I don't know but it's got to be a lot.\\" The owner doesn't want any trouble. Foster's like yes trouble. The owner grabs a baseball bat thinking that Foster is a robber. They have a scuffle Foster takes the bat & says \\"You think I'm a thief? I'm not the 1 charging 85 cents for a STINKING SODA!\\" He literally wrecks shop & says he's knocking prices down to 1965. Foster pays for the soda with a dollar takes 50 cents & tells the owner \\"It's been a plesure frequenting your establishment.\\" Which I do get a laugh out of I can admit that this movie is relateable with the trials & tribulations of every day life even in todays world the economey is horrible & the price of goods is going up but what this guy is doing isn't right. Foster is in this gang area these 2 Mexican's show up they tell him that this is gang territory & asks him if he can read the sign which is nothing more than grafitti. The gang banger tells him that it says no tresspassing. Foster responds maybe if it was f-----g english maybe I could f---  in  g understand it. He tells them that he's just going home & to let him pass through. The gang members want his briefcase 1 of them pull a Butterfly Knife on him. Foster chases them off with the bat & takes the knife that gang member had. Meanwhile you have Sergenat Pendergast getting all kinds of jokes pulled on him cause it's his last day on the force. You find out a little bit about him & his wife & she's not all there & they also had a daughter who died when she was 2. Anyway that shop owner wants to report a robbery only he wasn't robbed he was beaten up but gave a discription of the man a white man in a shirt & tie. Then you have those gang bangers they're going to do a drive by on him they gun down bystanders & their car crashes Foster takes their guns shoots the leader in the leg with an Uzi. This is 1 of those times you want to root for the villain if you want to call Bill Foster a villain. Then you have this 1 guy in the park that won't leave Foster alone he keeps begging for stuff. This is also where  I stole the line back when I did my Karate Kid III mega rant when I put wtf were you a drummer boy when I was talking about the villain Terry Silver  serving in Nam. Cause in this movie this guy says he was in Nam & Foster responds what were you a drummer boy. Then that guys like oh I meant to say The Gulf. Anyway you have the girlfriend of 1 of the gang members telling The Police that there target was a white man in a white shirt & tie. Sergeant Pendergast decides to solve 1 more case before leaving Law Enforcement. Cause the past few years he's been doing nothing but desk work because he was shot in the line of duty. Foster goes to this place called The Whammy Burger he tries to order breakfast but the stopped serving it he tries to talk with manager & he still doesn't get his breakfast. So he pulls out an Uzi people start freaking out. Foster tells them to all sit  down & enjoy their lunch that they all need their nutrition. He goes around & asks how everybody is doing this 1 lady throws up & Foster says \\"I think we have a critic.\\" He turns around & asks for lunch after asking for breakfast so badly that he held this restaurant at gunpoint. Then you have this scene at this Pay Phone this random guy wants to use it & Foster takes The Uzi & shoots The Pay Phone up he tells him \\"I think it's out of order.\\" Meanwhile Pendergast gets word about what's going on during his lunch break Detective Torres goes to look for this guy. Meanwhile Foster is at this Military Supplies Store that is ran by this obvious Racist. Detective Torres comes in & asks him if he's seen the man they're looking for. He tells her that he hasn't seen him. The Store Owner takes Foster to the basement & shows him all these illegal firearms Foster sees that he's into all this Hitler garbage. He tells Foster that they are the same Foster tells him that they are not the same he tells him that he is an American & he isa sicko & that's putting it nicely. That crazy owner handcuffs him & decides to turn him in. Foster takes a  Butterfly Knife stabs him in the shoulder then shoots him dead. Foster changes into a combat style uniform he walking around & in the middle of this traffic jam there is this guy yelling at other drivers he punches that guy right out. A construction worker tells him he can't pass through Foster tells him that the road was fine 2 days ago & that they're just doing it to justify their budget. He pulls out a rocket launcher & this kid tells him how to use it. This kid thinks they're filming a movie he asks what the name of the movie is Foster says \\"Under Construction.\\" Anyway he fires the rocket launcher it goes under a sewer line or whatever it is it hits the construction site & causes a big explosion. Pendergast remembers seeing a guy who fit the discription of who they are looking for on the freeway he checks out the license number of the car that he left the plate says D Fens they find out D Fens is Bill Foster they go to his Mother's house they find out he was a Defense Contactor who had been let go a month ago. Then you have The Golf Course scene which is funny & evil at the same time. This old man tells him to get off his Golf Course this old man swings the club hits the ball & yells fore. Foster pulls out a Shotgun & yells \\"Five! What are you trying to do kill me with a Golf Ball!\\" He shoots the Golf Cart the old man has a heart attack he asks for his pills & there in the cart which has gone into the pond. What Foster tells that old guy as he dies is so hilarous. I know it is a funny scene but it is evil caue this guy is doing wrong. Eventually he calls his wife again she knows where he is at so she gets her daughter & gets out of the house. Foster gets to the house where he finds it empty he sits & watches some home movies. Pendergast & Torres arrive at the house where Torres is shot Pendergast takes her gun goes after Foster who has found his ex wife& daughter at The Pier. His ex wife tells him he is sick & he needs help Foster tells her \\"You want to see sick take a walk around this city.\\" Pendergast shows up & tries to reason with him. He tells him he is lucky to have a kid cause he had a girl that died. Pendergast gives Foster's Daughter a bag of popcorn she shares it with her dad which distracts him Foster's Wife throws his gun into the ocean. Pendergast tells him that he needs to be taken in. Foster tells him after I worked to help The Government I'm the bad guy. Pendergast tells him taht he was going to kill his wife & child then himself. Foster wants to draw  he pulls a water gun on Pendergast. Pendergast shoots him Foster says \\"I would've got you.\\" Cause there is a drop of water on Pendergast's forehead. Foster falls into the ocean he wanted to be killed so his daughter could get the insurance. Foster's wife goes back home & tals to Pendergast some neighborhood kids show up for that girls Birthday Party Pendergast tells her to tell her daughter tomarrow. Pendergast decides to stay a cop & that's pretty much the movie. Falling Down is a movie that I saw back 12 years ago & it's still an amazing film. Almost perfect imo. The score by James Newton Howard is pretty good. Joel Schumacher did a really good job directing &  I can say this is his best film. Michael Douglas was great this is my favorite role by Michael Douglas. Robert Duvall did a good job. Rachel Ticotinb was ok. Falling Down I can say go buy it.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|Awesome show.  Watch it from Season 1 on....you will be very glad that you did!  It really is an addicting series with so much going on.  It's amazing how they weave all the stories together.  Characters are great -- played by really good actors.
B008KE3960|4.0|My 10 year old son loves to play this game. Great app for all ages. Takes some skill, but friendly enough for a older child. :)
B00499QUK2|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing another version of Sherlock and will watch others. I enjoy Elementary, also a Sherlock show.  It was entertaining, the humor and the all going on regarding the two characters, their quirks and issues and how they help one another.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is really fun to play I have played it a lot since I got it
B005JE7XW0|5.0|This movie cought me off guard. It was very funny. I know there is no way this could happen but still funny
0756407125|5.0|Kvothe will astound you with what he has accomplished and leave you wanting more.  This story continues with his &#34;love affair&#34; with Denna and finally finds him a patron...at least for a little while. He meets Felurian and spends time with the Adem, but the book does not finish his story and raises more questions than it answers...like what happened with Denna, how and where did Kvothe meet Bast, did he finish at the university, and lastly how did Kvothe end up as a mere innkeeper?
0061906220|5.0|The story is so cute.  Even better, the download of the author and a group of children reciting the book is charming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like subway surfers! One of my friends showed it to me and now I'm addicted to it. And I'm showing lots of other people about it. You guys should make one where you can build your own coarse then play on it. But you don't get to choose where you put the power ups and mystery boxes. It is a surprise of course! I love subway surfers!!!!!<br /><br />  ~Mystery person (Lacey Smith)  ;3 SUBWAY SURFERS!
B00005JNQS|5.0|I originally purchased this movie when my children were young.  Now I have a 2 1/2 year old grandson and he loves it...somehow the orginal was lost...so I ordered this one to replace it.  I guess you can call this a &#34;classic&#34; never goes out of style!
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book in my opinion is the best compared to the two books that came before it. I cried twice! It definitely had me turning pages! I highly recomend this book!
B0031RS2HC|4.0|A good, diverting read in the tradition of Lee Child. Reacher is an intriguing character and the plot suitably complex.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Makes you think!! I find this game addictive and challenging as well as beautifully designed. I am not a pro gamer to know all the specs but I do know irs fun! Definitely worth the $4.99!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|From a very young age I've always loved the Batman series, as they continued they just got better & better in my opinion. Great movie except for the unfortunate tragedy that happened in Aurora, Colorado so at times I still have a hard time watching the movie or just that eerie feeling that lingers when I do, may they all RIP. A great movie nonetheless, I feel its bittersweet!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was great.  I would 'recommend it to anyone.  It would be a great class READ aloud or just a great book to read to yourself.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a masterfully done, a real treat to watch. Streaming via Amazon is excellent quality. It's just like I'm watching HD movies on my tv/blu-ray player.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Both my husband, and I loved this series, and only wish that the third season goes on 'Amazon Prime' status. We totally enjoyed taking a glimpse inside the lifestyle of the 'rich and famous' of the British aristocracy. Watching the senior Mrs. Lady Granthum in her role as the matriarch of Downton Abbey, was as if the rich dowager in Nanny Mcphee was somehow transported to this castle. The entire cast have done a wonderful job of knitting this into a believable story of how it must have been. I especially loved the blending of the sisters personalities. From the strong willed to the wallflower to the ambitious, we are presented with very distinctive ladies.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George R.R Martin delivers another wonderful tales wrapped in tragedy, conquest, and romance. Be warned however that this is no light read by any means. I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed should you decide to pick up a Storm of Swords.
B001XV09UG|2.0|Meandering, frightfully self-centered; if having little moral value was the underlying intent of the film as a reflection of modern society, well, then it achieved its goal.  But otherwise, it was turpitude - didn't make it more than halfway through, and even cut short, I regret spending the amount of time on it that I did.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great actors, great story line, interesting because I do believe society will change this way hopefully later than sooner but quite interesting. WATCH IT!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I felt like I was there with Katnip every moment, feeling her pain and anguish as well as her joy.<br /><br />Well written and difficult to put down!
B001BWDG0W|5.0|Mamma Mia is one of those musicals that is totally joyful and uplifting.  The cast is of course amazing, and to hear Meryl Streep  singing was incredible! - And other cast members who don't normally sing as well.  The plot was good, easy to follow, and each song was better than the last.  A great movie and soundtrack!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It held my attention. I found it hard to put down until I had finished it. I would recommend it.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I just finished epic adventures I was disappointed the puzzles to move to the next chapters were to easy and the only difficult part about the hidden objects was some of the items were so small they were difficult to see
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book i read in a long time. Im looking foward to reading mocking jay and catchind fire :+()
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I never realized how much I loved Tom Hardy since I saw him in this and realized he was Bane from The Dark Knight Rises, another great movie I absolutely LOVE.  I've always loved Shia LaBeouf that's definitely a plus. Great film, great acting and I've always enjoyed true stories, can't get sweeter than that!
B002UM5BXW|1.0|The book was OK<br />I like the way you can borrow from the book store. It was an interesting read. Hope everyone will like the book.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Awesome game, but once you unlock the 2nd of 5 sharks, it becomes unrealistic to progress without spending real money. I especially resented the fact that you basically have to pay for the sea map.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is an amazing series as everyone who has ever seen it knows.  I am still annoyed that Amazon will not let me give a star rating without a comment.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|It's that good. I feel like I hear a little bit of several bands in this record. Song after song you're starting to hear on commercials, intros, etc but don't realize it is Imagine Dragons. You will soon enough. I pick up a little Coldplay one song, Blue October the next, and a Disney uplifting &#34;On Top of the World&#34; to round it out as cheesy as that sounds.<br /><br />If you're not sure about a new album to listen to because of what genre of music you think you like, this one will change how you view &#34;new&#34; music. Anyone can get down to this album.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|A very insightful book the could be much better with more of Shins life and less of the author. More insight and context if N Korea would have been better. Less descriptive and less judgmental writing would have made this book better. Overall a good book..it just took too long to get into and stay in Shins story.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is a awesome season. I'm very happy I choose to purchase it it's always ready on time for me to see the next episode. wonderful!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Action packed and a mystery to boot-  great animated film my kids watched it two times in a row and my wife and I were entertained the whole time.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Even though the descriptions and the need to fill explanations, names and events are sometimes long and tedious. But Mr. Martin does a great job without botching it keeping the tale moving, and always interesting.
B005P39GOI|5.0|By far one of the best albums I purchased last year. He has a bit of David Gray in him, which as any DG fan knows, is a good thing. I think there might be one song on this album I have to be in the mood to listen to. Otherwise, the rest of it just plays through.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I would have given 5 stars but at level 8 the 500k token counter does not work so it is very hard to get to level 9.  I reinstalled and lost all my tokens and still does not work.  I can get the achievement of million tokens but the 500k achievement is stuck.<br /><br />otherwise it is really great!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I've just spent several hours having fun with this scanner, imaging family Kodachromes and Ektachromes from the 1960s for insertion into an on-line gallery. Because it's actually a camera and not a line-by-line scanner, it's very fast- a great help when you have hundreds of images to prepare. It's also exceptionally easy to use. Push a few buttons to select mode, and then scanning a slide or negative takes only two button pushes. Because it scans to an SD card, rather than to a computer, you can use it anywhere. I use mine in a room in my basement, where I have have a desk and light table set up for sorting photos and where I store all my slides and negatives.<br /><br />The image quality is good, but not great. It's more than adequate for displaying photographs on-line, but not sufficient for high-quality digital printing. But then, this scanner doesn't cost $1,000-2,000, either. For the average user looking to share or preserve family photos this unit is an excellent choice. Exposure is automatic, which means that well-exposed slides and negatives will come out well. But the scanner will overcompensate when digitizing night shots, like fireworks, or shots with a lot of shadow. This can be corrected by entering the \\"Exposure Value\\" menu, and clicking on buttons until the exposure looks correct, but it's a bit clumsy. Still, it's acceptable for a budget unit.<br /><br />A few hints: As some have noted, the plastic film inserts- only necessary if you're working from negatives or unmounted tranparencies- are very easily scratched. Treat them with with kid gloves! It's not a bad idea to use a piece of tissue or clean cotten to insert and remove them. Store them in separate envelopes when not in use. And get an aerosol can of \\"pressurized air\\" to blow out dust before scanning. A few invisible dust particles will look like giant blobs when scanned and blown up. (Disclosure: My unit was supplied by the distributor for evaluation.)
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|I liked it.  It has been a number of years since the first I read it. I read it to help a friend study for some tests and quizzes.<br /><br />AJS
B008VVT51U|5.0|With beautiful souls and some nasty realism in the mix. Of course Maggie Smith.  Romance.  Problem solving of those living an adventurers life is always fun to see. The economic situation, with new tricks being learned while personal philosophies are evolving holds the interest of this viewer. I wrapped myself in the film's warmth.
B00A2V2SS4|5.0|Love watching the old Star Trek shows . Being remastered make a great deal ofvdifference with the ships shots thay look almost as good as the movies that came out years later
B0000CABJ1|5.0|From the beginning &#34;Love to Love You Baby&#34; I was a Donna Summer fan and this CD is captures the Disco era to the 2000 decade.  Donna Summer has a wonderful and strong voice.  Glad I purchased this CD and consider Donna Summer one of Special Diva's of our time.
B0030F5W5K|4.0|I like to re-watch this every so often it has a good story, there is humor and sadness pretty much everything.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I too have been using this app for around 2 years and I would be lost without it.<br /><br />A new issue just came up with the latest version (today) that double-vibrates when I swipe left to erase a word. Also, what has been happening (but I have not been irritated enough to report) is that, depending on the app I am typing into, the cursor is tough to control. Lastly, \\"speak and type\\" has been working but didn't work during the creation of this review.<br /><br />Overall, a five star app! And with confidence that these issues will be resolved because it and the devs are THAT good.<br /><br />The heat map that shows where I am actually pressing the virtual keyboard is great.<br />Predictive typing, recommended typo fixes and adding my words to the dictionary (I wish they would remain in a user dictionary FOREVER) make owning this app a no-brainer. I love it! Motorola DROID X

B00BIQU1K4|5.0|I've been a fan of Wilson's work since Porcupine Tree's Signify came out, and have followed his evolution dutifully. This new album is truly a thing of beauty, a focused progressive rock album that borrows from the best traditions of the genre, and also from all eras of Wilson's past works.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I loved the third season, because it keep you on the edge of your seat.  I really enjoyed Walter's character.
B0056FMNYA|5.0|First a disclaimer, all the cameras I used with this belt / mount are M43's (GF1 and EM5), if you own a larger / heavier camera setup, your mileage may vary.<br /><br />I've always hated carrying my cameras on a neck strap, the strain on the neck, the constant banging of the camera to your torso as you walk, the fear that the camera can swing out and hit something... essentially, it means you have to always have one hand holding the camera. Alternatively, you can store the camera in a good camera messenger bag or a sling, and the 10 seconds it takes fiddling with the zippers and getting the camera out can mean missing out on a shot. Putting the camera back is another hassle, eventually a lot times you end up hand-holding the camera all the way.<br /><br />The Evo Camera Belt is a great solution.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The materials and construction all seem very sturdy, the extra red security lock very useful.<br />The camera release is fairly quick, I can get my camera out in 5 seconds or less. Putting it back takes about the same time.<br />With the camera pointing down, I no longer worry about my telephoto lens jutting outward and hitting random objects.<br />The Evo's quick release plate is compatible with quite a few high end tripods.<br />The WDS (weight discharge system) works by spreading the weight of the camera over a larger area, making cameras feel lighter on your hip. Not particularly useful for M43s but it does work.<br />More importantly, the WDS prevents your lens from hitting your thighs or catching your pants.<br />You can attach the plates to your own belt, or the webbing supplied. Flexibility is always good.<br />Wearing the webbing belt a little loose means you can swing the camera front to back by rotating the webbing.For quick access leave the camera in front, for better mobility swing it behind you. On the other hand, If you attach the plate to your own belt, the position is final.<br /><br />Cons<br />Not specifically a con for the Evo, but like all recent camera carry systems, the Evo utilizes the tripod mount (1/4'' screw) to secure your camera. Obviously this puts a lot of strain on the socket, which isn't really designed for this purpose. IMHO the heavier the camera the less reason to use something like the Evo Belt.<br />Bulky. The WDS is a big piece of plastic strike plate. The webbing belt is very thick and doesn't roll up well. Its cam buckle is over-sized for security. All in all, the Evo and its belt takes up more space than my camera.<br />The thing is almost 60 bucks, and is basically just a glorified neck strap, so unless you are as picky as I am about carrying your camera, this isn't really a great 'bang for the bucks' product.<br /><br />Over all, IMHO the Pros outweigh the Cons. There are a few camera carrying systems out on the market, some much, much smaller than the Evo. But the Evo's ergonomics, the security features, and the general ease of use makes the Evo my current favorite carrying system.but like all recent camera carry systems, the Evo utilizes the tripod mount (1/4'' screw) to secure your camera.

0307277453|5.0|In his book \\"Your Inner Fish\\", Neil Shubin examines the commonalities found between humans and the entire spectrum of organisms found on earth, as well as offering a compelling portrait of a scientist at work.  Neil Shubin is famous for leading a paleontology expedition that discovered fossils of the Tiktaalik, which is a fishlike creature with a rudimentary wrist.  The Tiktaalik, with its blend of fish and tetrapod features, is considered to be the missing link between sea creatures and land creatures.  Part of this book is an accounting of the author's expedition to the Arctic Islands where he discovered the Tiktaalik fossils.  Regarding these expeditions, he says \\"Most people do not know that finding fossils is something we can often do with surprising precision and predictability.  We work at home to maximize the chances of success in the field.  Then we let luck take over.\\"  As he shows, fossil-hunting expeditions are a combination of back-breaking work, educated guesses, and serendipity.  The Tiktaalik, with its unique combination of fish and tetrapod features, is a glimpse at how sea creatures made the shift to land.  This accounting alone makes his book a valuable treasure.  However, Neil Shubin chose to delve further, by showing us the many commonalities that humans share with a wide spectrum of species.<br /><br />Teeth showed up in the fossil record very early on; they were found attached to the impressions of soft-bodied jawless fish.  As Shubin explains, the process by which teeth develop - the result of interactions between two different layers of tissue - has been adapted for the production of other organs, including hair follicles, feathers, and mammary glands.  The author's explanation for this startling array of adaptations is: \\"This example is akin to making a new factory or assembly process.  Once plastic injection was invented, it was used in making everything from car parts to yo-yos.\\"  In this vein, the author goes on to describe the evolutionary origins of our bodies, describing everything from the anatomy of our head to the development of our inner ear.<br /><br />This is a book that offers a peek into what makes us human.  More than that, this is a book that reminds us of the beauty of the world around us.ary origins of our bodies, describing everything from the anatomy of our head to the development of our inner ear.<br /><br />This is a book that offers a peek into what makes us human.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book is about a boy names Thorgrin AKA Thor.  Not knowing his mother and his father and brothers can't stand him.  Almost like Cinderella.  All his life he has only wanted to do on thing and that is join the Silver and fight for the King's Legion.  But as far as his family is concerned, his brothers can do that but he will be stuck herding sheep for the rest of his life.  He has a wonderful disposition and is very down to earth and one day leaves his home to join the Legion.  It is about Kingdoms, knights, the ring that surrounds the kingdom which is a magic ring, being a part of something bigger than yourself and growing up.  It's about coming of age, falling in love, fighting against evil and magic.  Morgan's characters are delightful and its easy to get drawn into the story.It takes you far away to a fantasy land where dreams can come true and you can believe that chivalry is not dead.  This book takes you out of the 21st century and puts you back in fantasy land where the story grips you and leaves you wanting more.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.  This book is great for all ages and it makes the imagination soar.[[ASIN:B00AFROVQC A Quest of Heroes (Book #1 in the Sorcerer's Ring)]]

B0057MFQMI|4.0|This 'Travel Kit' is for attaching your B-Grip Evo to a backpack shoulder strap. It works well on backpacks that have a nice thick strap, not so much on the ultra-light straps. The whole thing works on friction, so if your strap is too smooth or too narrow, the whole set up, along with your camera will just slide down to your stomach. Fearing that, the kit includes a 'security leash', but since not all backpacks are designed the same, you might have a hard time finding an anchor point for it.<br /><br />The camera cover / rain fly is sized for a mid size dslr with a mid size lens. What that means is if I have an pancake lens on its way too big and loose, and when I have a telephoto lens on it isn't big enough to get around the whole getup. As for the water proof aspect of the cover, it works, but I never felt confident enough with it to use it in a downpour, even if my camera is weather sealed.<br /><br />For 20 bucks I feel like this is a useful kit for specific situations (when you have a medium sized backpack, carrying a mid size dSLR and a kit lens, walking in a light drizzle), and a little over priced.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I will love this after I figure out how to go from one Book and Verse to another.  I really want to take it to use in church.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I loved this book I am so happy I read it I am such a directioner .<br /><br />Ps zany you can spoil me<br />Love you guys!!<br />Your best friend<br />Natalie m
0312427999|5.0|Don't save this for bedtime reading; you won't sleep well.  Thank you Naomi Klein for what has to have been considerable effort and research.
B007R0WHMK|4.0|I liked the scheme of it all.<br />not sure about the ending. That was totally unespected.  All in all it was a good movie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is too cute for words. If you love the show as much as I do (which is a lot!!)  then you NEED to play this game :) I think its fun and kind of addicting. It's like farmville meets My Little Pony but way better. I think its especially cute since it sort of follows the story line of the actual series. The game also involves characters that you rarely see in the series. Even Derpy :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Though I'm heartbroken by the ending of season 3, I know that life is often like it.  Perhaps seeing how the family carries on after such a tragedy, will help someone going through the same sort of loss.  The acting is suberb, the staging and costumes are beautiful, and there are so many personaliies we can relate to.  A masterpiece classic indeed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much<br /> it is so amazing<br /> thanks again for making this game.it is a fun game to play.
0385335997|4.0|excellent writer, already read previous 2 books of this serie, would love to read the next to continue..<br />very interesting story
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Prometheus definitely falls into the &#34;old school&#34; of science fiction, where its up to the viewer to draw up their own conclusions about what they are seeing.  Even the film's weaknesses, such as the use of Vickers, a couple of action set pieces, etc., are offset by the film's beauty and solid pacing.<br /><br />Prometheus was not what many were expecting, and that's one reason why I admire the film as much as I do.  Not many directors can tell stories visually like Ridley Scott can.<br /><br />This film is also a victim of a lot of reviewers looking for something wrong with it.  If you're looking for flaws in films, you're going to find them.  I find it laughable that Avatar has higher critical marks than this film, even though that film is essentially Dances With Wolves on an alien planet, with great effects.  Prometheus is something original, and what's better is that its evident that Ridley Scott had a great time making it.  I highly recommend this.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|This book is way worse than the first book<br />This book would be good for anyone who likes adventure :)
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love watching it with my husband!  I need apparently 14 more words to complete this survey which is ridiculous!!  The end.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thought it was a very good book. 10/10 stars This book made me cry and smile. I loved this book
B00881VLCE|5.0|Challenging, yet does not take too much time to complete a game. Some games take forever to be finished. That shouldn't be the case on a small device.
B000002UAF|5.0|How can you not love this cd? If I Fell,one of my favorite songs is included. A purchase to treasure!
B001GXF2YY|4.0|I would highly recommend Angels Flight as I would all Bosh novels by Michael Connolly. He wasn't a cop but knows how cops (especially detectives) think. We are not all shinning hero's and may be our own worst enemy but we feel for the innocent. Connolly shows that in his writings.
1400063736|3.0|I am forcing my myself to finish this book because it is  my book club selection.  Some of the chapters are interesting and others I just skip over.  My husband knew something was wrong when the book mark did not move for several days.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|To be honest, I did not read this book as I went to see the movie and did not want to spoil that.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|all I have to say is its free who doesn't need a calculator I take my kindle every where having this on there makes life easy
B008MEM24S|5.0|I loved this app it is great for entertainment at random times and I love it especially when traveling I would recommend it to anyone
B00499QUK2|5.0|Just a pleasure to watch.  Brilliantly filmed, acted, and written.  Sherlock and Watson play off of each other perfectly.  Oh, and Moriarti is the best villian I have ever seen on TV.  He is the very definition of creepy!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was a great read. Coming from a person who doesn't like to read this book had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. My respect goes out to him. Must read this book
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|There wasn't enough action or pretty girls in this one. It was like the producer was on a really tight budget.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Thus show is so addicting. U gotta atleast watch this season to try it out. And the fact that prime members get all the seasons included with membership is awesome
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I super love this game!! There's nothing in the app store can beat this kind of running game! Thumbs up IMANGI STUDIOS! I hope you could also make a third version of this game!:)
1596680199|5.0|This book has lots of great ideas for beads, but you must know all the basics first and some of them require that you have a lot of experience with the clay.
1451695195|5.0|I was drawn in from the very first page and spellbound to the end! Thanks to Eben who shared his fabulous story...non-fiction can't get any better than this!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I laughed throughout the entire movie. Ted is so cute, he makes you want to believe in magic and wishes.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Just another season to keep me addicted to the show. I wish their was more than just a few seasons. Gotta keep watching!  You will love it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Its an amazing story that i ever read. Its like in a real life that makes me excite and nervous at the same time. Two thumbs up for Nicholas Sparks.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is a great app - using it on my Kindle Fire, my Android phone, my iPad and my computer. Thanks!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have given this book to my roommate that has opposite reading tastes from my own, my best friend that thinks death is appalling, my younger brother that hates reading, and my girlfriend that loathes young adult fiction.  All four (in addition to myself) were immediately hooked.  I don't know anyone that has ever picked up this book and not been addicted.  It's easily the best of the series, but it will be hard to stop from reading books 2 and 3 once you finish this one.  Don't order this book until you have a little chunk of time on your hands because, I assure you, you will want to keep going once you start it.  (This book is not comparable to Harry Potter, but I think it's the next best book series attracting similar fans.)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good the dynamite. There's a man running, and running, and running, and running. why doesn't he get tired? HE JUST RUNS!!!#
B003XRELGQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite K. V. stories. It's got just about every element: comedy, drama, suspense, intrigue, blackmail-all laced with the possibility of the end of the world as we know it. I got the professionally narrated version, which is pretty neat. I didn't know what to think of the option and thought I might as well get it on a book I really know and love (I've read this several times) and it really does do something for it, admittedly I read the majority of the book this time, but next time I will probably just have it narrated. This book is one of the few I read repeatedly it's that good!
B008APX4P0|4.0|My son just graduated with a degree in Computer Graphics & he wanted this monitor for its great graphics.  He's really pleased with the monitor.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Lee Child and it certainly will not be my last!  I enjoyed and was intrigued by the character of Jack Reacher and the other characters were interesting and fully developed.  I found I was disappointed when the book ended and I quickly ordered Jack Reacher, No. 2!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this one so much can't wait to start the last one. All of them are hard to put down.
B0095R6OBS|5.0|When I found out that Disney was doing a full length animated version of this personal classic, I was so excited! And to my great surprise, not many people seemed to remember this one! Well I love it and now have it on a more updated version (my copy is VHS)<br />If you like creepy/cute this is wonderful story of a little boy and his dog and the tragedy they overcome. Enjoy!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is one that the whole family can watch. My 3 year old grandson likes all the parts except the part with the Hobo on top of the train. Tom Hanks and all the people that put this together did a great job!
B009O2XY12|2.0|When I download a free app I want to be able to play it anywhere on my device not in the cloud.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Did way surf is fun<br />I like it is Ralph Nader and the math emma Watson is a girl under the rope and I was a girl in a baby full episodes of the math and the woods is fun to see if I am i adopted is a girl is the woods has to do so oo
B003V9OCS8|5.0|good acting, suspenseful story. the story turns heartwrenching towards the end, that's when I stopped watching. will come back to it when I feel ready to face the gory part
B008EQHV5Y|5.0|Totally bizarre premise.  Will definitely appeal to those with a soft spot for art, music, civil disobedience, occupy movement, etc.  Charming and unique.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I could not believe how many hit songs she has on this CD. One after the next after the next. Great purchase. Small crack in CD case.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A wonderful story, connecting, musical genius, Detroit's Motown and apartheid South Africa in a tale of resurrection and success.  .
B00785P2QC|3.0|I don't have a lot of time to play so my &quot;goods&quot; go to waste..... still have it but it makes the game harder when you have quests and not enough money to buy what you need.
0061120073|5.0|What a wonderful and delightful novel that depicts immigrants and first generation Americans with dignity, pride, and tenacity.  It's a sharp contrast from the immigration situation we have today.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Very funny, I read this and I loved it! It had funny parts and crazy parts and that's what I think makes this book 5 stars!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Story moves abit slow at times, but overall OK. Could have been a bit shorter than the current 2:18 length.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Pure on the edge of your seat entertainment. History that is better than fiction. It deserves every award it won.
B000F8O35U|5.0|well worth the money...great sound and pic....no complaints.....great  movie..... thank you  we enjoyed the movie very ....much.....good deal and fairly priced
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a terrific app for when you are on the go. You can use it while shopping to keep track of your spending, or when you want to figure out sales tax and tips. It's also handy at home for paying bills, balancing a checkbook,etc.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It was entertaining but definitely not &#34;best picture&#34; worthy.  I also saw Lincoln and Silver Lining Playlist and either of these two deserved the Oscar before Argo.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game for your horse lover! Keeps them busy without the expense of a real horse ;) graphics are really good too.
B004T4M5TM|4.0|Great funny book, Tina at her finest and funniest, laugh out loud in places.......She has promising future in writing as well as anything she wants to do..
B006GWO5NE|3.0|It works fine but my kindle still does not alway charge so I do not think it was the cable.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show.  The quality of the picture is great!  I am mainly viewing this on my iPad.<br />My sister was excited when I told her she could get season 2 through Amazon and ordered it too.
B0081336FO|5.0|While remaining true to the story line, this series really puts the story in the context of today.  The humor is well mixed in and the story is fast paced leaving you thinking all the way.  Hopefully a season 3 will come out someday.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Most enjoyable.  Warning that it is highly addictive and once you finsih one episode you will not want to wait for the next.
B000VHVGM8|5.0|Kevin Kline at his best. Awesome cast for one of the best funny movies of all time. Would give it 10 stars if I could.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have just started using Pinterest and it seems pretty cool so far. I am also using Springpad and find for both of these apps that having a shortcut on your computer to just \\"pin\\" or \\"spring\\" something comes in very handy. I am enjoying both of these apps.<br />Janice Brodowsky
B00499NHLC|5.0|While remaining true to the story line, this series really puts the story in the context of today.  The humor is well mixed in and the story is fast paced leaving you thinking all the way.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I started using this app a couple of weeks ago and I haven't had any problems with it. I recommend!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I started watching this show late and had a hard time understanding all the backstory. I bought these DVDs and couldn't turn it off. What a fun show to watch! It's been years since I've enjoyed a show this much. I also bought this DVD set for a friend and my grandma. Everyone loves if!
B007EECSFA|5.0|A master of misdirection, Morton has woven a tapestry with materials that turn out to be very different from what one's first impressions assume them to be. Shifting perspectives not only between characters but also eras allows her to provide just enough detail to support changes in direction and nature, and she handles this tricky task well. My only quibble would relate to a handful of communications (letters, phone calls) that appear, disappear and reappear with surprisingly expedient timing for plot purposes. Still, this sort of mystery within a mystery within a conundrum almost begs for that device, so the quibble is minor. In short, Morton provides an excellent mystery - longer and more-complex than is usual for the genre - that is well-fleshed out as to atmosphere and characterization. I can think of few better reads for a rainy day by the fire with a box of chocolates and a cup of tea.
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|I did not fin this book, or rather article, informative. Based on the title, I expected it to define in technical terms what HTM5L is, and I expected it to be detailed and provide examples. I think the total content of the book could have been stated in about one half of a page.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have been using this app for a couple weeks and I haven't had any problems with it. I look at, bid on, and buy many items.
B005HEK3JW|4.0|This is still one of the greatest Star Trek series ever put on television. IMO I think its better than the original series.  And any series that came after this, never lived up to the Star Trek galaxy.
0142407542|5.0|I bought one copy for my grandchild ( two and a half) and one for me and we Skype and read the book together.  She loves the book.  I love the book.  We like the story and the pictures.
B00ARAO720|4.0|Lots of cycling action, fast paced. Romantic side to the story is kinda weak. Overall worth watching, especially if you are a cyclist.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey is a very talented and creative woman. I have always enjoyed the sound of a violin, but she takes it to the next level with her music. I love seeing people my age doing something original. I definitely recommend!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Only good for the closest city... would be better to use GPS to pinpoint your location!  Also, very slow to load maps
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|My son introduced me to Gotye at Thanksgiving and he received this for Christmas. Little did we know his song would win Grammy!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Ordered these due to the Great Value, compatibility and can keep some for spare, and use in  multiple items that they are needed for.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Very interesting documentary. The story is clearly remarkable but the amount of planning that had to occur was even more amazing. Gives you chills seeing the footage of him on the wire between the two buildings.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|ease of use, quick downloads, and fair pricing.... what is there not to like.  My favorite app so far!  Great!
B00000IQW5|5.0|I had a copy of this and somehow lost it in moving furniture around. Happy to have this movie back in my collection.
B00006J3WH|5.0|My husband is a Buffy enthusiast . Just had to get this for him . It was a really Great buy!
B009NTNHJU|5.0|Love this! Nicki is witty, has an amazing voice, music is beautiful, and all of this is complemented by well mastered album. Sound quality is very good too; if you have good equipment, you'll get  a kick out of that.<br /><br />As I did not have her previous CDs, this album is an amazingly great value to me too. 27 songs for the price of one CD? How much better can it get? Regardless, even if it only included 1st CD (8 songs), I would be perfectly happy too, as it's just great.<br /><br />I am definitely in and looking forward to buying more amazing albums by Nicki.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderful show. If you are a first timer to the show you should start from Season 1. This season has a lot of things happen but the end of the 3rd season is very dissapointing. I haven't decided if I will watch Season 4.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Ordered these due to the Great Value, compatibility and can keep some for spare, and use in  multiple items that they are needed for.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|My husband and my daughter are Who extremists. They never miss one show. Just had to get this for them so they could watch whenever they wanted. Great buy!
B008Y6TD5A|3.0|Mixed feelings about this movie, &#34;edge of your seat&#34; moments yet it almost seemed to be a chore to finish watching to completion.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's a wonderful show with a great story line, wonderful clothes and dianamic characters. Recommend it to any Ango-file along with Season 1.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read this series two times and I'm reading it again for a third time. I love the story line and of course the love scenes are the best. Ana and Christian from love in a hopeless place but in the end love provails
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My husband loves Disney movies and especially this one. Just had to get this for him so that he could watch whenever they wanted. Great buy!
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Great item for price, needed a way to brighten flashlight and extend battery life. Great buy. Push button is solid
B004VFOS2Q|5.0|I didn't see the movie in the theatre way back in 67, but certainly experienced the music all these years.  Too bad musicals are not being made like before.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I cannot temper my review at all. It is too hard. The book is simply wonderful. If you don't identify with the metaphors, that's really too bad because they spoke to me over and over.<br /><br />In other words, please don't kid yourself. This book is not about a circus. It is about you. If you let it.
B00821OX98|5.0|The acting is good the writing is good, the plot is intriguing.  If you like sci-fi it's worth checking out.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a must have series I have watched it over and over again and I learn something new each time, its wonderful. This is also a great gift for anyone that likes documentaries an true things about this world. Awesome series, love it thank you Amazon.
B003L77FYS|4.0|Funny was an unexpected delight after the series &#34;Firefly&#34;. Serious, angry, vengeful is a tired theme. The star brought a character that is fun to watch.
B004W1GCQO|1.0|If you are looking for a Downton Abbey fix... this isn't it.  It's choppy and doesn't flow organically.  Watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to view.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the competitive version. It inspires me to try to beat my times. I'm down to 4:50. Still not good enough for the opponents.
1449415881|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He brings the cartoons to me every day. This is one of the best Dilbert calendars in years. Love it.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|My first reaction to Zero Dark Thirty was that it was a near-great film but that it wasn't great because it didn't show that the people who do this work (relentlessly torture, hunt, and kill people) must be able to shelve their own lives/humanity for the time it takes them to accomplish their mission. This film does everything so well that it seemed a shame that director Kathryn Bigelow didn't show that Maya (Jessica Chastain) was in any way conflicted or troubled about the torture she witnessed and allowed. But then it occured to me that the people who do this kind of work do it precisely because they are not conflicted about it.  One of Maya's black ops co-workers, Patrick (Joel Edgerton), at one point decides to get away ftom the torture facility and go back to Washington, however, this is not because of any crisis of conscience, but simply because he wants to try something else for a while. So this refusal to show either Maya or Patrick as in any way conflicted about their work is actually the boldest choice Bigelow makes with this film. The people who do this work, especially Maya, are no-nonsense types and Bigelow's no-nonsense style foregrounds that quality. I don't think we can really tell by watching this film just what Kathryn Bigelow's politics might be and so they are never a distraction. I enjoyed Argo quite a lot, but saw this the day after I saw Argo and there is no comparison. Argo consistently entertains, but Zero Dark Thirty will blow you away (regardless of your politics). My revised opinion of this film is that it is a great film. Probably the only reason it didn't win any major awards is because the movie doesn't exactly condone torture but it doesn't condemn it either, it remains neutral so that you can decide for yourself how you feel about it. And this makes some viewers (who are used to being told how to feel---with music and other cinematic devices)feel uncomfortable and uncertain (which is what Bigelow wants). But don't take my or anyone's word for it, just see it. You won't be sorry.word for it, just see it. You won't be sorry.
B00821OX98|2.0|Cheesy, dialogue is unreal, characters one-dimensional stereotypes. Best part is the aliens. Maybe they'll win and rid the world of those horrible people.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Very suprised just how good Arrow turned out to be.  I am at episode 6 and can't wait to watch more.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|The audio is amazing. The picture quality is good, even if sometimes the editing was a little &#34;jumpy&#34; for someone born before 1980. We love this recording and will watch it many times.<br />You get a sense while watching this of the love that binds the band together after all these years. They are all so good at what they do, each of them could be leading a band on his own. But they stay together because U2 is more than the sum of Bono, Edge, and the other members of the band.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Griping story; well developed characters; real page turner...I was sorry when the story ended. I would recommend this book to all who enjoys reading a really good book.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Watched it twice.  Glad to see it won Best Documentary at the Oscars.  A fantastic story  told with great skill.
1416575464|4.0|Pictures and recommendations are provided in this book for the novice, and suggestions are clear about what can be done in certain areas of your home.  This is not only a wonderful book/resource for decorating your home but also a great table book for your guests to peruse!
B003U53GK8|3.0|I expected a much better ending than this.. It seemed some fantasy in the end..<br />And now I think all the cast is dead in that at teh end.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Dr. Scarpetta is back in the throws of a good mystery.  I enjoyed this book but wished for more interface with Lucy.  Miss that character!  I would recommend this book for a long time Cornwell reader.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|No guilt about enjoying a fine series like this one.  It has everything to make me a loyal follower-love, mystery, laughter and more. Watch!
B0010SKSTO|3.0|The author uses his experiences to explain subject matter.  This keeps the read interesting and provides some evidence that the author has uses this in the field.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|It was the not the best of the Bond films. If you have nothing to do on a Saturday night, it is worth watching.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is an excellent show that seems to evolve nicely with each season.  Much like in the other seasons, the science is sometimes suspect but that can be overlooked due to the extremely well done story line.  Very addicting, once you start watching you won't want to turn it off.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I feel like Season 2 was a little better. I really disliked the baby scene with her son present. It's still very entertaining and has my attention though.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Have you ever wondered who would win between Batman and Superman... guess what- in a handful of beautiful minutes- you will see that question played out.  Moreover, this batman is gritty... he will get his hands wet only if the situation calls for it.  And he's old, not the picture of human perfection, Bruce is well into his 60's... and it is evident in his fighting... as well in the various characters he meets throughout the movie.  For a second i didn't think i would like it, but i purchased this for my library and it was well worth it.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|I have seen every one of the episodes of SG-1 and i never get tired of seeing them.<br />I always seem to see something  i missed the time before.
B00000CQJZ|1.0|I received this DVD and was very excited to watch it with my family. Visual quality was a 3 out of 10. Also the DVD was stopping every 3 minutes. Had to reboot the DVD player to watch another 3 minutes. Quit that after two tries. Received a total of 6 DVDs in this order. Four were marvelous, great quality, but 2 were extrememly poor quality. DVD player was in perfect condition because checked it with several other DVDs. I feel that &#34;The 39 Steps&#34; and &#34;Penny Serenade&#34; were a waste of hard earned money.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book!! The author has a unique way of writing. I like all of the twists and turns...I never know what's coming!
B00BESLHEA|2.0|For a second, i thought- maybe... but then Russell Crow comes on the scene with a spinning knife gun and more weight than he has ever had in a movie.  While the concept was a good one... the filming, acting, and production lack promise.  I will say one good thing about this movie, it had the feel of the old 80's black belt movies with the crane style against the drunken fist art... and i do realize that is what the movie aimed to do... however... it just fails.  If i had not already paid for it- i would have probably turned off the movie.
B001MLEW2S|1.0|This was probably a great movie in it's day but  but the way movies are now days makes this one real lame.
0767821769|5.0|Tender, sweet, courageous!!! If you know someoe fighting cancer, please purchase this so you can better understand their journey. Tears!!!!
0446585025|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my wife who happens to be a big Ellen fan. She enjoyed the read..
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I was surprised a how good this movie was.  I watched it with my little daughter and she adored it- even though her father is built more like Frankenstein than the slender Dracula.  The theme was mature enough that it discusses letting your child be the person they want/ dating/ and true love.  Also, it is amusing enough to occupy the adult's attention.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is a story with many layers and levels.  If you like a good mystery and are psychologically minded I think you will really enjoy this book.
1451629184|5.0|A little difficult to follow, but you understand the way Jayce had to process her story. It came out in bits and pieces not in chronological order. What she endured for such a long time and how she is healing is truly a miracle. I will never look at a pine cone the same and every time I see one, I think of her.
0765325950|1.0|I rate it a 1 star due to lack of e-book, and the fact that they charge more for the electronic version than the paperback.  It makes no sense to me that it is more to send a PDF vs printing out a book and mailing it to me, not to mention it is an incredible waste of environmental resources.
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|What starts as a rather interesting thriller ends up being a paranormal mess at the end. The premise is quite puzzling: Has been one-hit wonder writer desperate for another hit moves his family into a house where a family was ritually hung, with the youngest of the family missing entirely from the picture. Things get interesting when he finds a box of Super 8 movies in the attic that depicts the murders... Then everything fizzles. The movie becomes boring and predictable. Ethan Hawke looks like he can't wait to collect his mortgage payment (I call the bad choices of good/decent actors mortgage payments). Vincent D'Onoforio couldn't even bother showing up for his part. He dials it in. There are no thrills, scares here. Just bad writing and decent acting. Go ahead and skip this one.
B0072V394E|5.0|The classic Italian western.  If this western had made it to the theaters before &#34;The Magnificent Stranger/A Fist Full of Dollars&#34; Clint Eastwood's career may have been different.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a great show.  My wife and I can not get enough of it.  Can't wait for season 3 to come on to Prime!
B0071BY1T2|5.0|best quality satch vid yet.  Even for DVD. However, the overall sound mix is a little muddy.  Not as sharp as last two.
178022219X|4.0|I have to admit; I didn’t really get into the book until I had read almost the first 100 pages of it.  I had a difficult time connecting to the characters and found the plot to be uninteresting at the start.  Defending Jacob tells the story of a 14-year-old boy who is convicted of murdering one of his classmates.  Jacob’s father, Andy Barber, is the Assistant District Attorney and once his son is convicted of the crime, he is removed from the initial investigation and left to defend his son’s innocence.  In my opinion, the book becomes a page-turner when Jacob’s father begins to take matters into his own hands to insure Jacob is found innocent.  As the trial takes place Jacob’s mother, Laurie, slowly beings to doubt her own son’s innocence as Andy becomes more determined to do whatever it takes to defend his son.<br /><br />As I read the book, I wavered between the idea of whether or not Jacob was innocent.  I felt the characters struggle and heartache as they fought to defend their only son. The novel kept me questioning not only the character’s innocence but also my personal beliefs about whether or not a child could kill.  I would highly recommend the book to anyone who is looking for a smart, suspenseful page-turner.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I liked this movie.  It was fast paced and action packed.  Daniel Craig is a very good James Bond. I will likely check out the other bond films that he stars in.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Nice to see a turn of the century series so well done. Great characters! Can't wait to the next season to be released.
0979019710|5.0|Hey! This is definitely the book to read if you're looking for a new start. Hal is brilliant and he makes it so easy to understand for us!!! Getting the journal as well.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This film was such a treasure. I am sad to see it didn't do better at the Oscars. At any rate, it tells a moving story, is well cast and overall a very inspiring and evocative movie.
B000000OS2|5.0|No complaints, I enjoy each and every song!! Not much more to say but my review needs more bloody words!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I dont normally watch a lot of television, but this is a must. The series shows us what greatness television is possible. I love the castle and the clothes
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love  to play an  this app works great! What can I say.....it's Solitaire at its best.  Great free app! Thanks!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|kids will love this app.  I even find myself smiling when I pet beauty and she seems to enjoy it so much.  the horse is so incredibly realistic in its movements and manerisms.
B00BESCJII|5.0|This is definetly not a feel-good movie, but it is a compelling story about very broken people who find each other and support each other.  Excellent film.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is a top notch game! The puzzles are entertaining and fun. They'll make you think but not too hard. The storyline & corresponding graphics are amazing! Very pleasantly surprised. The only drawback that I can see is that on some of the hidden objects games it would be nice if you could zoom in closer. It's not a big enough reason to not purchase the game though. You have a hint button that can help if you are like me & can't seem to find the very last item in the hidden objects games. This is not a strictly hidden objects game. Which is a huge plus! Well worth $2.99.<br />It should also be noted that it DOES work for the Kindle Fire. Hope you enjoy!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|It is a great album, I knew a couple songs not including Some Nights and We are Young. I love Carry On and It Gets Better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great TV series.  Stop surfing the channels looking in vain for anything worth watching.  Downtown Abbey will keep you  entertained and leave you wanting more.  One small caveat, the British accents can sometimes be difficult to follow so pay attention.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was truly uplifting and inspiring!!!<br />An amazing message about how we should be truly living our lives and all the nonsense that gets in the way of us<br />having a truly amazing experience and journey here.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever. Yes it is true that you should watch the handful of movies that lead up to this, but I think this movie, The Avengers, really made a great completion to the first stage of the Marvel Cinematic Universe!
B005LAII80|5.0|Wow finally a Dredd movie that honers the comic book character. Dredd bloody, nasty and fun for the adult crowd. NOT, I repeat, NOT for children. It's a simple movie with one direction but entertains perfectly. Urban makes a great Dredd whom by the way you never see his helmet come off which is true to the comic book character. It's fast paced and furious, never a dull moment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun, very addicting game. I highly recommend it! If they made more versions, I'd get them as well! I have had no issues with this game at all, an  it runs very smoothly on my kindle fire.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was informative and entertaining.  I have recommended it to many people.  I learned about an incident I knew little about.
B008Y78M60|4.0|Very realistic recreation of the situation alledgedly surrounding Lincoln's assassination. In my opinion what made this movie was the fact that most of the actors were &#34;new&#34;.Good drama!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|After seeing X-Men: First Class in theatres I knew I had to add it to my Blu-Ray Marvel collection. The story is about the begining of the X-Men team with good acting and plot. The speacial effects dont overtake the movie and are done well when needed. This movie is a must see not only for Marvel fans such as myself but anyone who enjoys fantasy, action movies as well. You dont have to have seen any of the other movies to get whats going on here. Although It does contain some violence and language I believe the cut off age to see this should be between 10-13 years old.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I love this series. Am going to order the fourth season soon. Would highly recommend this to someone looking to watch a TV series.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I really like Mr. Sanderson's style of writing.  It is fun and interesting, and it is easy to get into the world that he has created.  The reason I gave it four instead of five stars was that I didn't get a really good idea as to who the characters were.  I didn't feel particularly connected to any set of individuals.  Even halfway into it, I still didn't have a clue who the book is about.  Still, I enjoyed it; thought it was good fantasty; and would recommend it to someone searching for an epic fantasy novel.  It was similar to Robert Jordan's style of storytelling, and Mr. Jordan is the measuring stick by which I compare fantasy stories.  Sanderson's book is one of the first that I would rank up there with Jordan
B005HSL626|3.0|My 4 year great grandson was bored one day. I bought this game for him. He played for an hour or so and he seemed to enjoy it.
0316228532|4.0|Following the immensely successful Harry Potter series is no easy feat, and I can completely understand Rowling's decision to avoid all similarities to the magical world she created.<br /><br />While I definitely enjoyed this book, I'm certain I would not have bothered to read it had it not been penned by this author. In the back of my mind, I constantly compared it to her earlier work, marveling at the differences. In Vacancy, the characters -- all of them -- are much more developed than even the central cast of the Potter books. We see their deepest motivations (which are primarily ugly). We see their pains, their fears, their delusions, and their machinations. It's as if Rowling wanted to display the exact opposite of the epic and altruistic battle between good and evil, taking us instead into the minutae of disparate individual hungers.<br /><br />Unlike Potter, no character is 100% likeable or 100% detestable. Unlike Potter, each central character (and there are many) is a point-of-view character. Rowling slips almost seamlessly from one voice to the next quite frequently, something for which a less famous writer would be chastised (and mercilessly edited). Her ability to make each character distinct is impressive, as is her precise use of analogies to nail character traits and feelings.<br /><br />The plot itself is a cause-and-effect character study rather than a traditional 3-act play structure. Each act of fear, desperation, revenge, and rage cascades through the Pagford populace like an emotional avalanche.<br /><br />I felt the conclusion somewhat rushed, even though I was more than ready for resolution in the characters' sorry lives. While I have absolutely no desire to revisit Pagford or its denizens, I think Vacancy has the potential to become a quite popular television program. I also believe it would be excellent material for study in writing courses.<br /><br />~ Mia House<br />(c) Glass House Reviews
B005PTQPU0|3.0|I liked it - but music is a very different & personal choice / tast . Listen to various & learn to enjoy a variety !
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My Little Pony es un juego muy lindo, es bastante colorido y fantástico, es muy sencillo de jugar, ideal para niñas.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very good. Kept me in suspense, and entertained for a couple days on a cruise. Loved the book.I'm a big fan of Grisham, and he did not  let me down. Really a page turner.When's the next one....
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Just started playing and I cannot put it down.  Love the graphics and attention to detail.  This is my new favorite app.
B0062OCNAI|2.0|I didn't care for this book, but did finish it and as predicted, it ended as I thought it would after reading less than a quarter of it.  I found it difficult to read and it began to feel like a romance novel, which I do not care for any longer.  It is written by a British author and some of the terms were unfamiliar to me, which caused me to either re-read paragraphs and a few times use the Internet for help. But there are other reasons why I didn't care for the book.  For me the story was not very suspenseful, It did not move along quickly, far from a page turner.  As much as the main character had some endearing moments, I really didn't feel empathy for any of the other characters or even like them very much, except maybe the little boy Adam.  But I'm happy that Grace could pass onto the next world leaving this one so neatly wrapped up. How lucky for her.  But the whole package just doesn't get an A, or even a B from me.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Only could make it thru 1/2 hour, and then stopped. Move is more about alcoholic military men. Dont waste you money on this movie.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is another gift I purchased for a friend who loves watching this and I personally cannot explain about this type of Movie.<br />He enjoys it and was a special Christmas gift. Came early and was very pleased with the outcome. Thanks.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|so I had to have the soundtrack..A++++++...if you liked the movie then this is a must have.they same songs in the movie are on this
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Just amazing book and so much fun to read I recommend this to anyone that loves medieval times and dragons
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Kinda good, but not at all what movie was about. Its main topic was about an alcoholic man. Acting was good enough for me to watch whole movie, but topic was not what I eanted to watch.
0385751532|5.0|My students enjoy reading the book. With the Holocaust unit, this book was very fitting to the topic we were already reading.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The cast is very believable; no forcing themselves to be something they aren't, which viewers could easily detect.  The plot twists and often has surprises most viewers could not predict.  Few flaws surface.
1604680547|5.0|If you can't find what you are looking for in this book then you haven't looked hard enough. I've never seen so many designs in one place.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie used real news footage of the events it portrayed while telling a compelling story.  The movie was well played, well directed and superbly produced.  It deserved the accolades it received in the Oscars.
B0095P29EG|5.0|What can ya say about these action adventure movies from the gods...we always love the experience and ride...Go Thor your great
0321544080|5.0|I have been capturing images on film and digital media since the mid '90s and have a collection of about 40 \\"How-to\\" books and 30 photo art books, hundreds of magazines...  The Moment it Clicks is one of the few books I regularly re-read.  It is not a step-by step guide to re-creating the images seen, but more like listening to the chatter between photographers when they talk about their images.<br /><br />When I see reviews complaining that Joe McNally is talking about the wide array of expensive gear he employed to achieve the shot, and how no amateur can learn anything from what he is saying because of that, I feel pity for the reviewer.  If you are unwilling to conceded that to achieve the best results, you need to manipulate light in your favor... well, you are a painter with only one brush.<br /><br />Reviewing this book is a reminder to THINK about light.  How soft or hard do you want it? WHERE do you want it? Should it be warmer or cooler or colored?<br /><br />Maybe you can't afford half a dozen Nikon Speedlights, but where could 1 or 2 [[ASIN:B0079M711S Yongnuo YN-560 II]] help out? Can't afford an egg-crate, or a snoot, or a softbox... those can all be improvised if you get creative. Colored Gels and filters are cheap enough.<br /><br />If Dale Earnheart Jr. wrote a book about how he wins races, would you read it and then complain that \\"His techniques only really apply if you own a superlative race car and have a pit crew\\" or would you take to heart what he said and try to find ways to apply how he thinks and what he does to your dirt-track racing?<br /><br />This isn't a book of photo techniques.  It's a book about BEING a photographer.  Reminding you that sometimes just capturing the image is more important than capturing it perfectly, that the little details can be vital, and that personal interaction can do more for your shot than your camera settings, sometimes.<br /><br />Yes, Joe is stuck on lighting, and if you want to BE a photographer, then it wouldn't hurt to have your brain stuck on lighting too.ouldn't hurt to have your brain stuck on lighting too.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Addictive game and quite challenging for sure.  Try it and enjoy anywhere, anytime --- still trying to win!!!!!  Get it
B002O4JAV0|4.0|Started listening to Kid Cudi because of a Pandora station for Kendrick Lamarr.  Definitely a fan now.  This album includes several hits and is overall well done.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Anything Tommy Lee Jones is in is always great and John Goodman was awesome...great suspense and it all was worth the the time.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is my number 1 favorite character...He is larger than life and never disappoints my expectations a true hero.  Lee Child always hits a home run...I think I have read most of his books....Loved them all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app - it runs smooth, updates well, and shows multiole locations - the widget is my home page opener on my Galaxy
0307887448|5.0|This was a wonderful novel written for the geek gamer crowd that grew up through the 80s and early gaming. I simply couldn't put this book down- and didn't want the story to end.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun I wish I could play it all day every day but I cant so it stinks
B000001FKY|5.0|What can I say....Between Pyromania and Hysteria...how can you choose...Both albums are truly genius and I am so glad I purchased both and listen to them often on my ipod....Hurrah for all the great products now on the market....I actually found great background information about the  group on Netflix and ordered these albums after seeing the documentary about them (part of the series on Netflix--Classic Vinyl I believe....
B007HLIUN4|2.0|I am surprised that there is hardly a paragraph or two written devoted on India. India,since its independence from colonial rulers -the United Kingdom, has undergone substantial political & economical changes by transforming into an inclusive society. The process of transformation,even though slow and long, but Inspite all it's ills such as casteism , divergent populations of religious , regional , language orientations, is something to learn from. The author seems rather biased against India. I thought it didn't provide anything insightful -- waste of money.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Im in LOVE with this game but for some stupid reason it got uninstalled in my Kindle Fire and I didn't do anything! I was on level 65! and I have to start all over!
B00932A66Y|5.0|This movie was awesome!!! Great acting and directing.  Will definitely buy this on DVD!!! Subtitles were easy to follow, and you will be surprised by the ending.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Gets better with each one. Alway like the Will Smith movies...he is hilarious. Tommy Lee Jones is just as funny as always.
B00782O7IY|5.0|I have watched this movie 3 times--and I have loved watching it 3 times...JeanDujarden was great(an academy award) and the entire cast was wonderful--not to be missed...Barbara Cooper
B00APJLEGA|5.0|This movie is very cute and fun for adults as well. I love the story and it is a joy to watch.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|First of all, Denzel is a great actor. This man came make any character seem real. This is one of those movies where you want to see what happens next. It also makes you ask yourself, who's flying the plane, and is my pilot drunk or high, and can he land the plane without some kind of substance assistance. I loved this Movie!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An interesting look inside the life of a military sniper - from training to deployment to life back in the civilian world. I would highly  reccommend this book.
0762445262|5.0|Works great for how little it is.  My son loves it and it really lights up as a big bat signal on the ceiling at night.
0307408833|5.0|I bought this book because my boyfriend is diabetic and this book is just what I needed. He is happy with the end results unlike he used to be.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|Learned a lot about Bob that I didn't know previously.  Good to see his family was involved in making the project a success.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Had to watch this movie in english class and i thought it was going to suck, but it was actually a classic and i would defintly recommend watching it if you havent seen it before
B000OYC7A8|5.0|An excellent DVD. Quality sound and video. This DVD meets my expectations. High quality audio will crank up. excellent sound.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This has if not the best one of the best sound tracks.  Daniel Craig is the grittiest bond ever.  GReat!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Story is a bit cliche'.  Somewhat predictable.  Special effects and sound are excellent so, go for the HD version.<br /><br />Entertaining, but not a 2001:Space Odyssey or Avatar.
B006LSZECO|5.0|If I said that Gone Girl was a surprise,an electrifying, suspenseful, twisting roller coaster ride of a thriller, those words might describe Gillian Flynn's tale of two characters and a marriage quite like none I could ever imagine. At times I felt aligned with \\"Amazing Amy\\" and wondered why I am still ironing my husband's shirts then I cheered Nick 's fury and hoped that he would find a way to kill Amy long and torturously. I am already looking forward to another of Flynn's books. Her characterization is amazing and totally believable. If vulgarity offends you, however, you might want to skip \\"Gone Girl.\\" I am glad I did not.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I like the game.. it holds my interest and passes the time.. I did not give it more stars for two reasons.. one.. the game clues are very hard to find. The hidden objects are on the outskirts or behind the bar at the bottom. Some just impossible to find. Secondly the game only has a magnification x 1. So if you need to zoom in to see the hidden object's, which believe me you do,then this game is not for you. Appear from that it is still one of the better ones.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|I was frustrated with the storytelling and the theatrical oddities. Would have rather watched a middle-school play than this. BOO!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey is one of my favorite characters and he was great in this book  I hated for the book to end
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great set. Lookin forward to more. I can't wait to read what is next for Eva and Gideon !! Thank you.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I didn't give this 5 stars because it takes a huge amount of space, but a really good game. Easy enough for my 4 year-old.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|If you love the game? I would highly recommend trying out the songs! You get 29 songs for only $9 pretty good deal if you ask me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have really enjoyed all three books tremendously.  Has sparked my interest in reading again.  Going to have to check and see what else E L James has written.  Thank you.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Reminds me of X-Files - although I rarely watched that show.  Interesting show my daughter and I have enjoyed watching.  Can leave you hanging at the end of each episode.  Makes you think about what might be out there with bio terrorism.  Scary!<br />Don't let the little kids watch it - would probably give them nightmares.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|The app was easy to install. It is a great way to keep up to date on business news, latest technology and world news, etc.  You select the categories of your interest.  Very glad I downloaded this app and highly recommend it.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|In my opinion this movie was better than its predecessor but the story was pretty weak.<br />Some cool gadgets were the only thing that I found interesting.<br />Not enough action and a very generic simple bad guy plot.
145552347X|4.0|Wow, Mr. Hitchens is such a very straight forward, direct writer, and I so appreciate it in this well written biography of his sickness and eventual passing. My father died recently and I was looking for perspective on death and loss, and this brought me right down to earth.  So human, and matter of fact . .  it helped me bring my scary, mysterious &#34;idea&#34; of death into the realm of tangible, process driven, reality.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I like it so far not had a lot of time to see what i think But from what i see I think it will work great
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing if y<br />ou have read the first two.if not,it is very boring.<br />I like it alot<br />You should read it too
0316017930|5.0|As with his other two books, The Tipping Point and Blink, I couldn't put this book down.  Malcom Gladwell's writing is captivating.  His ability to share information through relevant story telling is unparalleled.
B000FC10WU|4.0|this is old school mystery was well written and I would not mind reading more from this classic mystery writer
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first I tried it on my friends iPod touch and I died the first few seconds but then I got it on my kindle and I just can't stop playing even though I keep on dieing every single second but I know if you get you will love it it's just like temple run
034580404X|5.0|I was skeptical at first in buying this, but once I started I just can't put it down.  I'm only about half way through the second book, but I still have to force myself at times to stop and go to sleep.  It's just that good.  The love story within the story, its just great, absolutely captivating.  I have a feeling that I'm going to be upset once I'm finished.  Hopefully I can find another book just as good.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love this book! So glad I don't have to wait to read the next one! Great unexpected twist on the story.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|interesting but did not knock my socks off. but it was funny in spots not sorry I read it but might not recommend it

B0076DELIG|5.0|I found this book hard to put down.  Harry's search for the truth and his since of justice makes for  a fast paced yarn. I love the Bosch series
B008XG1X18|4.0|this a great app. it is exactly like what's on your computer but you can take it anywhere. but sometimes it's hard to repin things and and look at what you already pinned and people you are following boards but other than that it is a great app.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Pleasantly surprised. Raunchy humor but that's what I like. This is NOT a kids movie. I needed 5 more words to post my review.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series....it gets better every season.  Amizon Prime made it very easy to watch.  I would highly reccommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another layer of Harry Bosch has been revealed! He plays by his rules!<br />Gripping story that brings the past racing back to life! If you love Bosch,  you'll love this book!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is amazing!!! it is great for kids of all ages!  it never gets boring of crashes. when you buy the product you get 3 fun games that are amazing!

B000OJFV4C|4.0|Costumes are wonderfully done and the scenery is beautiful!<br />The series kept me interested and anxious to watch the next episode.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Heartbreaking reading after knowing of his death in such an ironic way.  Not only a loss for his family, but for out country.
B004NEY9EW|4.0|Unlike old Bond films, this one has realistic gadgets. The action is great and highly entertaining. I am also glad to see a modern plot. Daniel Craig is great as Bond. I can't stand to watch the misogyny of the old Bond films with Connery.
B0085OELXK|5.0|Great acting and a fascinating story. An excellent cast does a great job in this one. I've seen this film about five times and always enjoy it.
B0081336FO|5.0|Love this series!  Well written and keeps you guessing throughout the show.  Looking forward to Season 3.  I would recommend it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game works well, layout and cards are designed well.<br />It is easy to play, and I like the automated finish feature.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Then this show is for you.  You will be hooked and you will love every minute of it. There's a reason why this show has caught fire in the US. Enjoy!
B001NEXEEG|4.0|This is one of the best westerns ever made. It's a classic with an all time great cast. My favorite scene is where John Wayne shoots the paint cans that Jimmy Stewart is placing for shooting practice, causing the paint to explode all over Stewart, followed by Stewart laying out Wayne with a sledge hammer punch to the jaw. .. The look on Wayne's face is one you will rarely see from John Wayne ever in film. ... Kind of like the scene in &#34;Red River&#34; when Montgomery Clift sends his father (played by Wayne), to the ground with that famous scene great punch.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|In this review, I am going over the pros and cons of this game.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-the game has a lot of dragons<br />-there's a lot to the game<br />-there's dragon races, which is really fun<br />-you're never money hungry - the dragons earn so much money so fast I never have to buy coins<br />-you can breed dragons to get hybrids that you can only normally buy for gems<br /><br />Cons:<br />-dragons when they are evolved tend to be only bigger<br />-the baby dragons I really don't find &quot;cute&quot;<br />-gems are hard to get<br />-most dragons that cost gems are REALLY exspensive<br /><br />all in all, I'd recommend the game to anyone, its free.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great combination of fun and strategy -<br />Makes you look at the whole and disect the pieces.<br />Reminds me also of the games involving maizes.
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|I just bought this CD & I have listened to it every day and every minute that I can. All I hear is the stereo on and this playing over and over again. I downloaded it onto my Ipod and that is what I listen to when I fall asleep, while I am in the shower, getting dressed in the morning, in the car, during school sometimes, and at my track practices! VERY good album. Not one song on here that is bad. PLEASE buy this album.
B009JTCBLE|3.0|This was my first exposure to BCC, so I can't compare this effort to their previous albums.  I tend to agree with some of the other reviews that the vocals are too dominant. I'd enjoy it better if there was more attention paid to Bonamassa's guitar work and Bonham's drum work, but the songs all seemed mixed with an intent to show of the vocals of Hughes.  The songs are very reminiscent of late 70's and early 80's rock, but many of the songs sound too similar to me.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I would have given this five stars save for one thing. The slider bar and description said there were over 300 pages to this book. It reached the end around 150 but the slider said there were still 312 pages to the book. I hope this can be fixed.
B008Y6SGC6|5.0|Sandra Bullock is outstanding in this movie.  The language is kind of rough, but the show is a very good show and sheds light on a big problem in the USA and around the world.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|Already liked the characters, so was concentrating on the story, which I also enjoyed.  it was nice to see how the characters faired after their weddings.  And the mystery made it a fun read.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I didn't find this novel to be all that profound. On the contrary, I felt a bit betrayed when it became clear that the main character was taking drugs and drinking underage, and yet his perspective was presented as something naive, unaware, innocent, unable to make decisions or understand his own motivations and the consequences for what he was doing. I find it hard to believe anyone could be that passive or that because of his 'innocence' he didn't share any of the responsibility for the things he was doing. By the end, I had been drained of sympathy for this so-called 'gifted' character. I didn't find the tragedies of the various people in Charlie's life to be that moving, either. More contrived, actually. I disliked the mysteries that were never resolved for the reader - the suicide mentioned several times, and what part Charlie played in that person's life, or who Charlie was writing to, or even his true identity. The mystery did not add anything to the story for me. Three star book.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Delivers what Tom Clancy has delivered for years. If you've liked his previous novels, this one won't dissappoint. If you've never read Clancy before, grab Hunt for Red October or Patriot Games and start there.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very deep and literal full of food for your mind. Food  friendship courage endurance and perseverance. Key attributes of books character. Opens up the door of your imagination
B0009IW9CK|5.0|Unlike most Mellencamp albums of this era, there were no obvious singles on this one.  But out of 'Scarecrow', 'Lonesome Jubilee' and this, I probably like this the most.  'Theo and Weird Henry' is one of my all-time favourite Melencamp songs/performances.  All the other tracks are striking.  They're mainly about ordinary people, ordinary people's lives and convey a sense of Mellencamp's basic humanism, which is very attractive in a world dominated by performers with very little between the ears.<br /><br />There's a very effective use of instruments here too; I especially like Lisa Germano and her violin.  What a fine musician.  This is a big-hearted, engaged, piece of very fine Americana.  Excellent, quite stark songs with just the right amount of (minimal) frills.<br /><br />Philip Ferguson
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just really loved this book!  This storyline isn't new ... and so you can probably figure out what's going to happen, right?  But I still thoroughly enjoyed it!  This was one of those books that I had a hard time putting down, and couldn't wait to pick back up.  It held my attention from beginning to end, and the story stayed with me after I was finished reading it.  I can't think of any part of the story where I got bored, like some stories go into so much detail you lose interest.  There were times when I was so tempted to skip ahead because I couldn't wait to see how it would turn out!  There is an unexpected twist in end that made the book even more likeable.  I'm really looking forward to the movie coming out!
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|So far a really enjoyable book. I look forward to reading it each night and would recommend it. Loving it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Such a great book, I'm a fan of the show and thought Id give the book a try and I couldn't put it down, can't wait to start the next one.
0451209338|3.0|this is ( and dont get me wrong, as of today feb. 25 2013, i have read alllll daniel silvas G.A. series ) like all earlier silva's gab. allon books, lacking our tech. in todays world.  the story is, as all his novels, GREAT.  my problem is that i started with the fallen angel and ended with the kill artist, so, backwards i noticed the lack of all the little gadgets that came later as technology progressed in the last few years.  im ordering the new book due in 7/13,  cant wait!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  I can sit for hours looking at the stuff.  Really a great tool to find what you are looking for and direct to websites and forums
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a wonderful book,could see myself sitting down and reading it for a second time...Sad thing is knowing stuff like this happens everyday.. but this inspires everyone in that situation to be strong and that you can get out and get help
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is pretty fun I have been playing it for some time and I have gotten my dad to be my neighbor. It sucks that you have to buy coins to get the best stuff and I'm sure that will hinder the game play experience eventually, but right now it just takes patience. I enjoy the battles!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|While the Adobe Reader seems so similar to the version on my laptop, I found that the documents downloaded into the reader aren't listed in the docs folder on the tablet. You have to open the reader and then see the list of PDF's you have downloaded. While it wasn't really a huge deal, it would have been nice if they included that information in Getting Started guide.
0440245206|5.0|I really liked this novel of Danielle Steele because it was softer than what she normally writes.  I loved that fact that he didn't have to have sex with tons of women just because his wife left him and their daughter.  I won't say more because I don't want to ruin this book for any one else who chooses to read it.  You will be delighted.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was a little hard to keep up with the characters at first. It was not my favorite. I did not get too excited about reading it each day :(
B001Q4Z5UY|5.0|Who doesn't love action movies in which the real bad guy rules but the innocent get even. Very raw, but who doesn't love Jason Statham?
B0085A9J18|3.0|I didn't care much for the story line or the acting.  But I did throughly enjoy the fight scenes!!!  I was exhausted just watching the kick butt fight scenes!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The entire series was a page turner for me. I have not seen the movie so that will be next.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Bought this for $30 and for blu-ray, dvd, and  digital copies of the second season of the amazing show Game of Thrones, you can't beat the price! And it arrived fast!
B000HKYN74|5.0|Season 3 of the Star Trek prequel was one of the most exciting and entertaining seasons of the Star Trek universe.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I didn't start watching this show until the current season.  Now that I have &#34;Season One&#34;, &#34;Season Two&#34; will be next!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this type of historical drama.  I learned some things I didn't know about what happened in England during World War I.
B008AX1HD8|2.0|I didn't like it.  Think I am tired of Jo Nesbo after 5 books.  Also living in Sydney Australia he didn't pay enough attention to his research.  Did he even come to Sydney? I know it is fiction but please get facts correct.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|This is such a great historical series. I am enjoying it so much, and look forward to watching more!  I highly recommend it.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|The deluxe version of bad is one of my favorites of all time. I thought this was one of the best deuxe packages i have ever owned
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Really I wanted to like this book just for kicks and well...thrills. but goodness it's hard to get through the constant self-doubting and \\"impassive\\" staring that takes place through the entire book!  If I hear the phrase, \\"cocks his head\\" or \\"stares impassively\\", again I may vomit.  Really James?  I wanna like this story just for the naughty parts but even that gets recycled over and over and over and....
B005KB0SU6|5.0|This is his second book I read and it grabs you from the beginning and mesmerizes you on all the sub-stories and sub-plots that are going on throughout the narrative.  His first book I read in English and it was also great!  Such a young author....
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I bought this and the older 1982 The Thing both from goHastings. The newer film plays great, but the 1982 film wouldn't even leave the loading screen. I'm am glad that a least this one does work, but still very disappointed the 1982 copy was flawed, it doesn't have any scratches on it, but instead has the wavy lines of a dead disc. This is some-what common as I had this same problem with The Hunger Games that I bought new from wal-mart.<br />But still, The Thing (both of them) are great movies.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|This is the definitive greatest hits album from Whitney Houston. Its really is a 5 star album . I recommend this to any Whitney fan.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The first book I bought on kindle. Certainly lived up to its title, peculiar. Had some interesting photos in it
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Gave it to a 10 year old who loves the same Beatles I grew up with and I am 65......
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I couldnt put it down!!! Very interesting, i think after reading this, Nikki Sixx is my new favorite rock star!!!!
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|The movie was good, but not great.  The movie also has is open ended. May they are hoping to make a sequel.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So far this application has worked outstanding, I am still finding great features.  Each time I use.....I find more I like.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story is a thriller unlike anything Alfred Hitchcock had written.  It will grasp on to you and you won't be able to put the book down!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really like this app! I like the layout of it and everything always loads perefectly! I can easily view my profile, newsfeed and messages without any problems :)
B009DJB9HC|5.0|Super groups have been tried before many times. Rockers of various caliber and accomplishment team up to jam. Some are flash- in-the-pan-one-album-and-done and others continue to rock. Black Country Communion is one of those rare combinations of seasoned rockers that just simply gels like they've been together for decades. Afterglow is an instant classic.
B00358ESI4|5.0|This movie was rather upsetting to me but I'm glad I watched it for its historical significance.  It really puts those war video games in perspective.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I finally gave up and quit the book before the fifth chapter.  It goes on and on for chapters just telling you how the main character got his name.  Boring.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game, it is very fun and addictive. The only problem is there seem to be a lot of issues with getting it on Android phones. I got a new Kindle Fire HD for Valentine's Day and it plays without any problems! The only thing is that you can't shop for new colors on this version. I have to get them on my phone (when I can manage to get the program to start.)
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|This album is truly wonderful, it is forerunner for album of the year so far. The songwriting and music is exquisite and Steven Wilson's angelic voice graces every second. Luminol is one of the best songs I've heard so far this year.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game something for Me to do when I'm board or nothing to do or just hanging out so kid like me love this game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a good book usually I know the end before reading a quarter of the book!! Not this one I only knew one thing for sure but won't say what it is because I don't want to run it.....This is a must read!!!!!! Excellent job Colleen Hoover!!
B008Y1YK9Y|1.0|The villain in this movie was way over the top - more disgusting and gruesome than I can stand (although I'm sure some people who are into horror movies would disagree). The story line kept falling apart and the whole thing, in my opinion, was contrived, ridiculous, and just plain horrible. The concept was good but they totally missed being able to carry it out. I was very disappointed in the movie, although very pleased with the timely manner in which it arrived. It's not the seller's fault that I hate the movie and I would buy from this seller again.
B001LF347E|5.0|I have to say that my son and I have watched all the seasons.  We just love this show.  I bought this for my nephew for Christmas.  They had never seen it before and he just loves it.  Gets the kids away from those darn games for awhile.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is a fun and easy way to pass time and is very fun. its a game that you will want to play all the time, like i said GET DIS GAME
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I think this is one of the most funniest movies I have seen in a long time! I could watch it over and over!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|You've gotta love James Bond, right?  It's always the same, only better each time.  More fantastic.  More thrilling.  More mind boggling.<br /><br />Daniel Craig has all the right stuff to be Bond, and this movie is visually stunning.  But by Bondian standards, the battle to find and take down the bad guy ~ a creepy Javier Bardem ~ seem more appropriate of a Die Hard sequel.  Dirty, bruising, bloody blow-ups.  Not the unrumpled, if equally predictable, suave, technical sophistication of our beloved James.<br /><br />But see it!  Of course!  You've gotta see it.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is ah cool game 4 my 4year old (&amp; 4 me 2)...not a bad side 2 it @ all...!!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great entertainment.  I would watch these cast members stand in an empty room and read phone books.<br />They are that interesting to listen to and watch.  So much so that I barely followed the plot.<br />May need to watch it again for the full effect.<br /><br />I hope the young Q is soon given new agents, staff, and agency to continue the good work of protecting the UK<br />and the world.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|The author does not embellish her character.<br />She is able, thanks to an honest approach, to take us right into her story, and make us part of the painful process of growing up.  From a depressed self-destroying sick puppy  to a healthy young woman,  thanks to her will, people's kindness and nature's healing touch.<br />Through her experience we learn that even when the body and the spirit might be broken, our will can be strong and with its help and the help of our companions on the journey, we can find salvation and redemption as we keep going.  While hiking the Pacific Crest trail, Cheryl learns to be the human being that she was meant to be.  As she sheds the unnecessary weight of her monstrous backpack, so she rids her soul from the weight of her past experiences and wrong habits.  The reward is a great adventure and a destination that is the beginning of another journey.<br /><br />Brava Cheryl! Good Job!....I hope you still hike.  Try the West Coast Trail in beautiful BC
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|When you are first introduced to this game, it's so much fun! But after awhile you get pretty bored and when it says &quot;NEW LEVELS COMING SOON!&quot; It's a lie because<br />it has been saying that for almost a year and guess what? It never happened! want to waste your money?<br />go right ahead and buy a game that you will play for 10 minutes and be over it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|its a good app. gives u a feel of tablet. earlier had to use browser for facebook. I would recommend.
B00005RY7X|4.0|I had this CD years ago and lost it, I love it so much that I had to buy it again. I consider this to be the origin of party rock. Speedy shipping, and the ability to stream it to my phone through the Amazon MP3 App is fantastic. I say buy this compact disc. You will love it.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This is a very fun game. I just wish I could play at home. I think there needs to be more items that only takes a few minutes to make.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|This is a really funny movie. Not a historical type basball movie about one of the greats, but  more a fell good for the underdog movie.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Lots of action was let down by ending wanting to get a sense of what was next ended like on a loop whole comparing it with older
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Love everything about mj I will read or watch or buy pretty much anything about him what a very talented mam
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A little confuzing at times, but overall, very clever. Always will be a devoted John Horsham fan. Look forward to his next book.
B008ROFRMM|5.0|Such a sweet movie in many ways-great imagination-evil character who gets what is coming to her-and a wonderful father-daughter relationship. All girls really are princesses! My nieces all loved this movie growing up and I had no problem watching it over and over with them!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I got subway surfers on my kindle fire hd and I loved it at first, but then I<br />started to realize what's the point in getting this game. It may be free,<br />but it's such a copy of temple run and temple run 2. Once I realized<br />that I deleted it and never played it ever again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|l love this app it is so awesome little kids love it my little cousin loves it and so do I but its not just for little kids I recommend 3 to 14 its that fun them older kids will love it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, simple and it is very user friendly, but not like one of the cheap calculators that only has the absolute basic buttons. Very useful for homework.
B007KW5MFE|5.0|This movie was such fun back in the day. Snipes was at his best. This surely beats todays so called vampire movies. I wouldn't mind extending this series. Picture and sound are excellent!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|This was a great story of intrigue and twists.  Kept my attention - enjoyed the escapisim.  Highly recommend this story.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|It lived up to my expectations. Some of the scenes are prdictable,you might even say cliche, but it had some good pyrotechnic shots.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|fabulous, buy it. i want newer stuff if possible. a new fan. also the neighborhood is excellent. have it in car, play it with top down, LOUD!!!!!!!!
B00005JLPK|3.0|Just OK..Kind of glorifies Marxism but interesting artistic lifestyle she led.  Bought it for research on school class project for online class.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Where to start? How do you make a Batman where \\"The Batman\\" (yes, apparently The Superman and The Spider-Man insisted on The The) is not in it as much as Commissioner Sid Vicious's '70s moustache or J. Gordon Levitation channeling his older alter Bruce Willis ego from Looper? Don't even get me started on McBane whose voice we finally nailed down as Marvin The Martian underwater after thinking at first he sounded like a Hungarian meets Dutch Goldmember of Austin Powers fame. Then again we spent half the movie trying to figure out how he ate. Did he get everything blended up and suck it through a straw?<br /><br />Speaking of voice work, what was up with Christian Bale when he put on the Batsuit deciding to adopt a Tom Waits meets Michael Keaton's voice from an earlier Batman? Or how about The Bathead's big fight scene with Darth Bane Vader where he decides it's a good idea to headbutt a guy with a huge chunk of metal attached right down the middle of his skull? Let alone The Batdude takes about six straight punches to the head and not a single drop of blood pours out. Is his head made out of the same material as his titanium suit?<br /><br />The story is so tired and old--madman holds city hostage with nuclear device (which apparently you can just fly out to the horizon and explode and not a drop of radiation will hit Pittsburgh...oops, Gotham). What's laughable are even more numerous preposterous scenes. Bad guys down in the sewer. OK, all you SWAT guys in full combat gear, let Commissioner Moustache go down first in a business suit and allow him to be captured by the bad guys. Good plan.<br /><br />Then while the commissioner (let me repeat that--the very top guy in the police force) is in a hospital bed, there appears to be zero police personnel posted in the hospital let alone on his floor or by the doors to protect him.<br /><br />Apparently because they were paying the actors so much money there was no budget for lighting either as it's more like the Dark \\"Night\\" Doesn't Rise. Plus we get gratuitous Liam \\"Quickly! There's no time!\\" Neeson, Morgan \\"Driving Miss\\" Freeman and even Matthew \\"Birdy\\" Modine (who deserved an Oscar for his excellent walkie-talkie work). But it's when Cillian Murphy and Marion By Cottiyard show up to join J. Gordon Liddy in this movie, I got the feeling director Christopher Nolan must've filmed Inception and this movie at the same time to save money.<br /><br />Did I mention how extremely slow the whole thing plods along? Even the special effects are ruined by too much talking and explanation after they're done.<br /><br />What will really make you laugh is how the police force decide to form one mass formation and charge both into a tunnel and later in the movie at the bad guys down a single street. It was like military tactics had not advanced an inch from the Civil War.<br /><br />The extras...well, after two hours and 40+ minutes of this nonsense, I was done. Let someone with a tolerance for more ridiculous filmmaking comment on them. (And, wow, not a single mention of Anne Hathaway until now!)t\\" Doesn't Rise. Plus we get gratuitous Liam \\"Quickly!

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|a must see...I had reservations eating chocolate pie b4 this movie, now I think of this movie every time I see chocolate pie or chocolate peanutbutter pie.
0439023521|4.0|I didn´t think I was gonna like this one since it´s my 16-year-old daughter favourite book/series. But to my sursprise it was really good and I couldn´t put it down, read the whole thing in two days! I especially Katniss the heroine, of course, but the description of the whole \\"universe\\" is also very interesting.
B006QPX7UI|3.0|This movie was a fairly realistic portrayal of the era, or so I'm told not having actually lived in that time. The acting by the major players was decent. The biggest negative is that it was intended to be a mini-series and it shows. Proper editing could have easily removed another hour from the length. That being said we did watch it all the way through with only a handful of breaks to look up more information on the internet.
B005LAII12|1.0|What the what is this? No, seriously. Who thought this was anything more than a one-trick pony joke let alone a full-length movie. After you get over the fact a stuffed bear can talk and tell dirty jokes that fall so flat, I was more fascinated by the fact that apparently Puddy and Ryan Reynolds are a gay couple.<br /><br />Basically, the movie fails not so much in trying to translate \\"Family Guy\\" humor without censorship but the fact it's a run-of-the-mill rom-com when it comes right down to it. Boy has girl. Girl wants boy to grow up. He says he will. He doesn't. They fight. They make up. He sees the world in some new light (thanks to a talking stuffed bear, mind you), and they live happily ever after. Snooze and fest.<br /><br />Extras are a total waste. The outtakes are even less funny than the movie itself.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|we really enjoyed the movie and I loved the way it ended.... perfect!! Although the movie felt long, it was worth it!
1400052181|5.0|As I write this review of the book there are now over 1600 other Amazon reader reviews. Just the other day that number was 1300. What can I possibly add to that conversation? I'm not interested in arguing against those who wanted something else from this book. Without meaning any disrespect, they can continue looking somewhere else. For me Rebecca Skloot took the questions that initially intrigued her when at sixteen she first heard of Hela cells in a biology class: who was Henrietta Lacks and if her cells are one of the most important things that happened in medicine in the last hundred years how come nobody knows anything about her? Great questions! Good for Skloot for pursuing it and all the subsequent questions until she got the answers. Yes, her search becomes part of the book because that is what this questioning is all about. It is the truth that researchers, detectives, and reporters seek. Unlike a third person narrative, the objective voice from above, I want to see the writer's purposes, biases, and values.<br /><br />In high school writing classes following your line of questioning may produce what we sometimes call an &#34;I search&#34; paper--a paper whose structure follows your own inquiry. For a student that is so much more rewarding than finding a theme among other people's disparate paragraphs copied and pasted from the net, or, from encyclopedias--the source for those of us whose high school education preceded the Internet. The answers become original work.<br /><br />If Skloot had been able to find a satisfying answer to her original questions The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks might never have been written, but she didn't find those simple answers and like Hela cells themselves the questions lived on and on.<br /><br />From my perspective the book is about two tribes made up of individuals who understand and sometimes strenuously defend the members of their tribe from outsiders. At the same time they may criticize and even attempt to ostracize those in their group who challenge the group's norms. One tribe is better educated, it's members often have clear and specific goals, and their understanding of the environment in which they live provides them the skills to negotiate that environment in ways that allow them to successfully achieve their goals. The other tribe is much less educated, has confused or unclear goals that don't seem obtainable. The two tribes don't communicate or interact with much ease. Yet as the book proceeds we become aware that both tribes have similar experiences. For example, both discover that their initial assumptions and awarenesses are wrong. Consider the doctors and researchers, who were unprepared for how the problem of contamination could jeopardize their work, and Deborah, whose suspicions interfered with her health and with her understanding of what took place. Some of the biggest discoveries are unpredictable surprises. Certainly neither Dr. George Gey nor Mary Kubicek expected Henrietta's cells to live.<br /><br />It takes people like Rebecca Skloot to make the connection between the two tribes, to bridge the gap. It also takes people like Louis Lefkowitz and Henry Beecher to elevate their own concerns about privacy and consent to the level of law. Otherwise, books like this may lead us to believe that Thomas Jefferson was wrong: all men are not created equal and are not endowed with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To be poor and ignorant is to be a victim.<br /><br />Five stars! Thank you Ms Skloot.those in their group who challenge the group's norms.

Certainly neither Dr. George Gey nor Mary Kubicek expected Henrietta's cells to live.<br /><br />It takes people like Rebecca Skloot to make the connection between the two tribes, to bridge the gap. It also takes people like Louis Lefkowitz and Henry Beecher to elevate their own concerns about privacy and consent to the level of law. Otherwise, books like this may lead us to believe that Thomas Jefferson was wrong: all men are not created equal and are not endowed with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To be poor and ignorant is to be a victim.<br /><br />Five stars! Thank you Ms Skloot.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I bought this because it was exactly what it says, the newest batman movies w/ some bonus discs. What I didn't expect, and maybe I simply missed it in the fine print, was the additional digital copy of each movie via VUDU.<br /><br />The additional content is great, as every other review states, the picture quality is what you'd expect from a blu ray. i'm not going to pretend I can see some clarity flaws b/c of this or that. Even if I could, it's a cheap collection of great movies - get over it.<br /><br />My only complaint is The Dark Knight. I don't know why, but the screen will change from a full widescreen (no black bars) to having bars while it playing, during change of scenes and such. It doesn't do it all the time, but often enough that I noticed. Begins and Rises did not do this, all of which were watched on the same tv, ps3, etc.<br /><br />One last minor gripe. Begins sound is...different from the other two. Not to say it's bad in any way, but it took some tweaking of settings on my amplifier to get to be as nice as the other two movies.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|One of the best plot lines in recent history covering many lines of current scientific exploration. Quirky characters. Hard to understand if one has no knowledge of genetics and quantum physics.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|This is an entertaining animated film that is both dramatic and funny for both children and adults.  Both my daughter and I loved it.
1449410243|5.0|I was just turned onto The Oatmeal...my friend sent me a link to a sketch about 'how to pet your kitty' and i saw an ad for this book on the side and came to amazon to purchase.  so glad i did.  this is a quick book to get thru, just thumbing thru it, you'll stop and read most of the cartoons quickly.  the poster in the back is awesome.  i'm going to hang it in my  Indy's area so she knows &#34;I'm on to her plans&#34;.  I especially love &#34;Cat vs the Internet&#34;  -- it just had me cracking up!  I think this'll go in my bathroom as reading material for guests (most of whom are cat lovers thankfully!)...very fun book.  I read some other comments and saw some weren't that impressed b/c it's a collection, of sorts, of published sketches that - if you're an oatmeal fan - you've probably alredy read and enjoyed earlier.  seeing as i have not, perhaps that makes this book more excellent for me!
0785156593|4.0|I've been wanting to read this for some time and I've to say I wasn't dissapointed. I sat down and read this in one shot; to give you an idea how engrossed I was. The story moves really well, they did a great job of juggling huge list of characters and using them appropriately.<br /><br />That being said, it does have it problems. If you are reading this as a standalone, then some of the characters may/may not be familiar. There was a few that I knew by name, but really knew nothing about (Cloak and Adam Warlock are good examples of this). The art is also not my cup of tea either. I grew up reading comics of this era and wasn't a fan of it then - color in what's important and leave the rest b/w. Be as that may, the book itself is as well put together and as well printed as anything coming out now.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This was a last-minute Amazon Prime date night movie and was perfect.  It had enough of a plot to keep it interesting for her and plenty of action for me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Interesting and hard to put down! The typical who-dun-it!!! Which keeps you wondering and thinking! Would definitely recommend for easing reading!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|An excellent and satisfying finish to a fine series-within-a-series. I love all things Pendergast, and this certainly did not disappoint.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|Interesting story and characters. Well written as well as entertaining. I enjoyed it. This is a different twist on a spy novel.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This movie continues the 007 legacy with one of the most interesting and close to possible adventures that I have seen to date. The only weak point (for me) was the lack of a truly hot partner/temptress.  But with that said, from a person that has seen every Bond flick available, for those that have not as of yet, I high recommend experiencing this one.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|After looking at least 50 different cases for an iphone I found this from amazon. I just have to say that the quality is good and the phone looks really really nice.<br />I totally recommend this case. Is not bulky and as far I can see it protects the iphone, of course the screen its still expose but so far it looks great.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|to be able to watch star trek, voyager, any time, any where, is fabulous.  I live on my Kindles.  Yes that is right Kindles, I have 4 to date.
B008JB4XX2|5.0|This is a Great Melodic Hard Rock at it's best.<br />This is awesome from the first song to the last.<br />I listen to Bleed and Scream at least 5 times a week.<br />I would tell all those fans of Journey, Survivor, and ToTo to give this a listen it has some great hooks as those bands I listed the songs tend to lean towards the harder songs of those I listed.<br />THESE GUYS ROCK!!!
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|This should really put his doubters to rest. Most of the judgement on him has nothing to do with his music but this album allows you to see him as an artist and appreciate his vocals for what they really are. He may not be the best or the strongest but he tries and gives his all with no tricks. Amazing! :) I will always be a Belieber.
B008YCMM2A|5.0|If you're like me, you've scrounged, begged, borrowed, and stolen to collect the 1969 European performances - mainly from radio broadcast sources, some in mono, mostly expensive.  CBS recorded a couple of performances (e.g., &#34;Juan Les Pins&#34;) but, oddly, the boot recording of the same performance was sonically far superior.  Now you can have a compendium of the &#34;third great quintet&#34; live in Europe in 1969.  The Juan Les Pins performance is back, among others.<br /><br />These performances were recorded after the departure of Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams.  Yes, it's a different band but no less groundbreaking.  Chick Corea, Dave Holland, and Jack DeJohnette, in all their youthful glory, are the rhythm section.  Wayne Shorter would stay with the band for another 6 or 8 months.  This is what the band sounded like just before the Bitches Brew sessions in August 1969.  There's a lot of experimentation; nothing appears to be off-limits.  These are wonderfully adventurous performances.  None of the new guys are trying to copy their predecessors; Miles and Wayne are in peak form.  And there's a DVD performance!  C'mon, this is a no-brainer.
B008645YH6|5.0|Highly recommend the cd. Upbeat, fun to listen to. She always mixes in interesting worldviews as well, so its not just noise like lots of other music these days.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the show but so sad about the characters that got killed off.  I can't imagine what will happen next.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read it in a day. I could not put it down. I was enthralled from beginning to end. I would recommend it to anyone in the mood for a thrilling romance.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great work. Love the atmosphere and good storyline. good graphics. not bad at all. trying to find part 2 and looking forward to what is in store.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I really liked this movie...I can see why it was nominated for an Oscar!  Great job, Ben!  A must see!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really enjoy this show, and so glad I could watch for free with my Amazon Prime membership!  I am all caught up with my sisters!
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|This is such an entertaining and well acted series!  I love the Fae concept and all the actors do a great job.  Each episode keeps you watching to the end.  Highly recommend!
B000FC10WU|5.0|I love mysteries, and Agatha Christie is my favorite. I enjoy the old fashioned, British manner in which it is written, and of course, Agatha Christie is classic!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Wow...I didn't know what the real person looked like behind this scam, but this is really sad that such things happen!  Be careful on the internet!  I had a relative who knew someone who met another person on the internet like this and he turned out to be scum and tried to rape the girl, but luckily my relative came home and saved the day!  So scary!  Good movie, though.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic series and  seamless delivery to ny Blue Ray.  Very fair price compared to a movie theater.  Can't wait for Season # 4 to see what happens next.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app works well with my android. I would recommend this app.<br />For the price it works well.<br />Good buy.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Very good case for Kindle Fire, it has a nice felt interior, I highly recommend this case to all Kindle owners!!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|John Corey is a character you'll enjoy through several of DeMille's works.  The first-person voicing is really fun and effective.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watched the whole 11 episode series in 2 nights--couldn't stop I was so invloved in the plot.  Recommend this form of delivery.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This wasn't quite like anything I have read before and much more interesting and intriguing than most &#34;who done it&#34; novels.
B002J20T12|5.0|i loved this book when i was required to read it for a class in college. one of my friends wanted to borrow it for the same class and never returned it to me, so this was replacing my original-- which was WAY cheaper on amazon than from the campus bookstore! interesting and thought-provoking. book was also in great condition--
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Well written, and very moving story. Really makes you take a look at your own life and remember what's important.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can not think of many other weekly shows with such intensity as Walking Dead. This show rivals amc's other block buster drama, Breaking Bad, and I consider that to be one heck of a &#34;roller coaster&#34; of a series. Amc seems to have people who care about entertainment rare these days of reality Tv.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I really did not think I would like this movie at all. My husband had been recommending it to me for years, and I finally gave in. It's actually really good, and I'd watch it again and again. Nice moral too!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed Season 2 of Downton Abbey.  The story line for upstairs and downstairs are enjoyable.  I was disappointed that Lady Sybill left the series.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This movie is charming and covers a segment of history as well. Great acting. Easy going, no frills kind of comedy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is far better than the original Temple Run. Its graphics are better and it is a lot harder to obtain a high score. I love it and my son does also!!!
B00A8KJN14|5.0|Love this movie! I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I was angry, best Burton film yet! I reccomend this to all doggy lovers!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The third season takes many twists and turns that are unexpected.<br />Peter and Olivia are on a roller coaster ride.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs. Zombies is one of the funnest games on mobile.  it has be hours of fun for my whole family
B004MC8CA2|5.0|With all the translations availible and study guides, this is the best Bible program I have found.  The book, chapter,  and verse selection is very fsst and easy to use.
B0000VD04M|4.0|This movie is long, but it's decent. It's more of a tribute than anything. I'd recommend it, and Johnny Depp is the best part of this film.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|First Radiohead album to listen to and purchase, now I'm addicted! Every song is excellent, but if I was forced to pick top 3 or die, it would be Nude, Jigsaw and Videotape
B009EEFTMC|4.0|challenging and fun, does not keep track of how many times you play but it helps pass the time. I like how the cube moves
B00BHMETKC|5.0|What a great look into history. This movie was suspenseful from  the start and very well done. Way better than I thought it would be.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I love this song, only wish they put this on the original soundtrack from the movie Skyfall.  Even though they didn't I wanted to get this since I love Adele and she does a great job with this song especially since she co-wrote it.  She just won a golden globe and an academy award for this song.  It is worth buying.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This movie was visually stunning. I don't think I've seen anything as impressive yet. The plot was simple enough for kids to follow along, however I wouldn't recommend it to kids younger than maybe 8.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series is so engaging and authentic!  It's got everything: drama, fighting, romance, deception, historical perspective!  The costumes and wardrobe are excellent! The scenerey is great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and very great joy should get it it is awesome amazing extremely fun good treat if it cost money I would pay for it
B007R3B4RG|5.0|I'm starting to like the ramones and Joey. I was told I looked like him so I was like might as well check em out and I like
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Very easy to use, and I'm quite happy with the sound quality (it could be better, but it's definitely an improvement!). The price is fantastic, and i like having the long cord to work with. It does require a battery, so it's good to keep a spare around, and there's no 'on' light, so you need to be careful to make sure it's off.<br /><br />Amazon shipped it very fast!
B008220DIC|5.0|I still don't know why this wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. That is disgraceful. I feel that it had excellent characters, acting, and cinematography. I think the plot could have been considered weak but I think that it added to the style of the film.<br /><br />5 out of 5.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Wasn't thrilled.  LOVE LOVE LOVE Seth McFarlane but this was definitely &#34;boy&#34; humor.  I liked it, I laughed, I enjoyed it just not one of my TOP comedies
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved this book, I just with there were more zombie fight segments in it.  Maybe I guess what I'm really saying is that I wish it was longer, who knows? Either way, I liked it and you will too.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is a fantastic movie! Great music and a great story. Music history with music legends telling about it. You just need to be a fan of music to enjoy this movie!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|cant get enough. this game is simple and fun.. I love Mario and this is basically the same thing.  I cant wait to play lep's world. two!! I'm a happy camper!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Wonderful real emotions & shared his experiences. Sad that after so much he dued at the hands of a military brother he was helping. A MUST read.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|This is a very well made toy and highly detailed and it's still holding up to every day abuse from a 4 year old boy and his 6 year old sister. I figured the jaw would have broken by now or it wouldn't still stand on it's legs anymore but no, it's as nice now as it was the day I got it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games series is by far one of the best books I've read.  It's a story that even now that I've been done reading it for two weeks, I still think about it often.
B002N2LEVM|3.0|Bad acting, but story line pretty interesting. It's is all I have to comment on this series.  Thank you for asking.
030758836X|4.0|Dynamic writing, engaging characters and alternating chapter cliffhangers kept me turning the pages. Although I found myself rooting for a certain ending, the one Ms. Flynn wrote was even better. In the end, very satisfying and well worth the time spent reading.
B007M45PMU|5.0|From start to finish, this is a great album. With every song, they continue to impress. I am constantly discovering new songs on this album. Not a bad song on the album.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show is fantastic I just start last week from the beginning and I'm already caught up thanks to amazon.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|EXCELLENT, THE PRODUCT I COME IN THE ESTABLISHED TIMES, IN GOOD CONDITIONS, GOOD SERVICE, GOOD SERVICEGOOD SERVICE, I LOVE IT
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Awesome game to play. Great traffics and story line. I hope there are more games to come like this one.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|From start to finish, this is a great album with great sounds throughout. They have a nice, crisp sound that is consistent. Not a bad song on the album.
B0030B621W|4.0|Moon starring Sam Rockwell and the voice of Kevin Spacey is a well done story that, like any good science fiction, is not really about the science and technology, but is using those elements as a springboard to explore human nature. Rockwell truly carries this movie in that he is practically the only actor in it, and I was impressed, and admittedly surprised, at how good a job he did pulling that off. I don't want to offer any spoilers, but this movie will provide a sort of slow-motion twist. Not a twist that you get all at once in a big &#34;ah ha&#34; moment, but one that is just sort of not there one moment, there the next, and then the story continues, exploring that understated revelation almost--but not quite--to the point where the viewer might be like &#34;yeah, I get it, I get it...&#34; But I definitely recommend it if you're in the mood to sit down and watch something that requires some attention. Maybe don't watch if you're in the mood for non-stop action, though.

1933492910|5.0|For anyone who likes to draw...run and buy this. Period.<br />For anyone who likes to see how creature design for movies is done from the ground up...this is perfect for you too.
