074322454X|5.0|This book is a great way to understand the American experience of World War II from the soldier's point of view.  The number of people is a bit hard to follow--I think that may be the biggest difference between fiction and real life.  In fiction you can make a story with just a few main characters; in real life things are not so neat.<br /><br />This book has a very reverential tone towards the soldiers of World War II.  I think it is very important to understand this attitude, because it is still affecting current politics.  The World War II generation had many heroes--but it is also the generation that believed the good times would go on forever.  We are still paying for some of the mistakes that generation made.  Today's battles over Social Security and Medicare, among others, are rooted in that belief that America would always go forward and that concern for the future was nothing more than pessimism.  Read it with a touch of caution.
0060512806|5.0|Suprisingly readable and quick despite the 1000+ pages and diverse array of dense subject matters, Cryptonomicon is one of the most satisfying books I've read.  <br /> <br />Briskly paced and enjoyable, even if it's discussing the history of arcane mathematics to readers who avoided math like a plague. Thoroughly researched, especially the descriptions of modern-day Manila. A lot of authors, foreign and some, even of Filipino descent, almost always get the locations wrong. Stephenson didn't. And I'm wondering if I have bumped into him when he was researching the book here. From his descriptions, only someone who has lived here for at least six months could get those images and anecdotes about our flawed nation right.  <br />Witty and funny too with the numerous humorous asides especially concerning Lawrence and Daniel Waterhouse. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book so much, I rushed off to buy books from the Baroque Cycle series. It's that good.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|Culled from a radio broadcast (and who told the moron announcer it was OK to talk over Coltrane?), and discovered among a collection of tapes in the family archives, this is one of John's very best live dates, and as everyone is pointing out, including his esteemable son, you see here how the transition was being made in the course of John's music. What's also on offer here is just how much he and Elvin Jones were on each other's pages. I have rarely heard such a sympatico among two musicians, even more so than Coltrane's rapport with Miles. That's sticking it way out there, but I can think only of Hendrix and Mitchell, Fripp and Bruford, as being in the same aether. <br />This is a club date and has a better than expected sonic quality to it, considering the source. Along with the Monk/Trane concert from Carnegie Hall released last month, this represents the second major release of significant recordings from a man who was at his most stunningly spiritual in a live context. Let's hope the family uncovers more, even if the sound is less than pristine. We all survived the OLATUNJI tapes in one piece, and the sound quality was horrendous, but no matter, it had enormous importance in the discography of John Coltrane. That same ethic ought to guide any and all future considerations.
6305428042|5.0|This film got pretty well raked over the coals by the critics when it first came out and died a quick death.  There it sat much like the witches until the Disney channel brought it back to life as one of their regularly run movies during Halloween.  These repeated showings have served to make it a minor holiday classic.  It kind of plays more like a TV movie than a big budge movie, but that's ok.  Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy play the Sanderson sisters who were put to death as witches back in Salem 300 years earlier.<br /><br />Flash forward to the present and Max Dennison and his family have moved from LA to Salem, MA.  Max is played by Omri Katz, who starred in the short-lived but underrated Eerie, Indiana TV show.  Max is having trouble adjusting to small-town life and becomes the target of local bullies.  Max is forced into taking his little sister Dani out trick-or-treating and eventually goes to the home of Allison, a girl he has a crush on.  They all go to a local historical museum and Max accidently lights the black flame candle and brings the trip of hags back to life.<br /><br />They attack the three kids but the kids get help from Thackery Binx, a boy who had been turned into a black cat by the witches centuries ago.  The witches plan to use the life force of the children of Salem to give themselves immortality and it's up to the three kids and the black cat to save Salem.<br /><br />This is really an enjoyable Halloween film for families.  There are some scares but nothing too frightening.  Bette Midler is grotesque as the buck-toothed Winifred Sanderson, bossing her sisters around and playing somewhat of a wicked witch on too much caffeine.  Sarah Jessica Parker is a scream as Sarah Sanderson, the Ditzy, blonde-haired sister.  There's a great scene where they intrude on a residents home and the residents are played by Penny & Garry marshall.  Really a fun movie for Halloween.
B00014X8KO|5.0|Memories consists of three seperate Anime stories, all with their own style but with themes that are very alike, that being technology and its effect on humanity. Each story takes its own direction, with \\"Magnetic Rose\\" taking the horror side, \\"Stinkbomb\\" taking a comedic side, and \\"Cannon Fodder\\" taking a side somewhere between the both of them, with an emphasis on animation rather than story. When put together, Memories makes one great Anime film to sit down and watch all at once or seperately. This is a great film for introducing people to Japanese Animation. It's never too violent, there's no nudity, and it's not so serious as to strangle you with tension.

ITS DISCOVERED AND TONES THAT DO IT AN EXCEPTIONAL DISK. BRAVO!! DEPECHE MODE!!
B0009S4IHY|5.0|This movie starts out on a serious note but quickly fades into one of simple hilarity, and keeps that tone for the remainder of the movie. Special effects dominate the movie but don't intrude, leaving an oddly believable style of action behind (floating characters, super strength punches, puffed-up breasts). Stephen Chow is the new Jackie Chan. I recommend this movie highly.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|Now, let me preface this review by saying that I'm not giving \\"Playing the Angel\\" 5 stars because DM is my favorite band.  While they ARE my favorite band, I had lost a little faith in them with the releases of 'Ultra' and 'Exciter'.  But, those doubts have fallen by the waistside with this new album.  This is the first time since SOFAD that I've gotten chills listening to a DM record.  When I first heard \\"Precious\\" about 2 months ago, I was grinning from ear to ear.  Just knowing that time the band spent away from one another didn't hurt the recording process is amazing.  Some other standout tracks include 'A Pain that I'm Used To', 'Suffer Well', and 'I Want it All'.   <br /> <br />Playing the Angel is probably the best album DM has made since Alan Wilder's departure in '95.   <br /> <br />Doubters and naysayers beware!  Depeche Mode's not going anywhere!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched maybe one complete episode of this show during it's TV run...I thought it was great.A week later I heard it was being cancelled and I forgot about it for awhile.Then scifi picked it up and I got to see a few more episodes...I was hooked from that point on.I have never seen a show with such a great premise snuffed out so quickly,the characters are charming and the plot is everything a great scifi show should be...actually it's what a great show should be,the story is one that will grab people who don't even like the science fiction genre.
B00008WT5C|5.0|This CD is amazing, the songs are very powerful and have a raw old rock music style, that's why this album is one of the best of the band. Bon is the best singer of all time in rock music. This Digipack is great, with a lot of pictures of that time. and a better artwork, the problem is what the past reviews said there is no Crapsody in blue!! but at least you can listen that song and carry me home (b side of this album) in the website that is written in the digipack but you must have this album in your CDROM to enter the secction where you can listen to them.
B000001FKY|5.0|I've been a Def Leppard fan since their \\"Pyromania\\" album was released in 1983, but they've one-upped themselves with \\"Hysteria.  This is by far their best album.  Every song on the disc is great, and there are five songs, \\"Rocket\\", \\"Animal\\", \\"Love Bites\\", \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\", and the title track, that went on to be major hits for the band.   <br /> <br />Led by Joe Elliot's great lead vocals, Def Leppard delivers a hard-driving style of rock and roll that the listener won't soon forget.  It is remarkable that Def Leppard's drummer only has one arm, because you would never know it by listening to the great drum solos on each song. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this great cd.  Listen to \\"Hysteria\\" and hear the absolute best from Def Leppard.
0345457684|4.0|Wow. Excellent book. My first try at this author and I was thoroughly impressed. It's a classic and complex murder mystery but I was more taken with the author's presentation of the future society. Morgan \\"cheats\\" with regard to the rules of classic SF convention by including technologies like faster-then-light travel and digitized consciousness without any explanation of technologies involved. Usually I like a little more Science with my Fiction, but if it's well done, as it is in this case, I don't mind taking the futuristic technologies at face value. In fact, half of the fun in reading this novel comes in infering all the events that have led to the current society. Morgan liberally sprinkles the text breadcrumbs leading back into the history of the world he creates. It was a little baffling at times keeping track of the large number of ancillary characters, but that may be a consequence of either the vast number of brain cells I've killed since in the past few years or my current habit of juggling three or four books and magazines at a time. <br /> <br />By the end of the book, I found it hard to care much (or indeed follow) about the resolution of the murder mystery. At first I thought of this as a weakness, but in thinking about it more, I realize that the narrative evolves into a resolution for the twisted psyche of the protagonist [Kovacs]--even he doesn't overly care about the murder anymore, he's more interested in redemption by way of...well, I won't give it away. Anyway, I realize that the diminished importance of the mystery may be intentional on the part of Morgan, and I was no less eager to reach the last sentence. <br /> <br />I'm really taken with Morgan, and pleased to have another hardcore/cyberpunk SF writer to pursue. The Kovacs of Altered Carbon is, quite frankly, a scary badass, and it's exilhirating to ride along with the first-person storytelling. The gunplay is immersive and it even has a few well-written and mature sex scenes. 4/5, with apoint taken off for its scientific liberties and because the mystery aspect was a little too complicated.
0156027321|3.0|All and all I enjoyed Life of Pi.  However it took me a while to get into it.  Part 1 to me was long, and I found it hard to catch my attention.  I kept waiting for the real story to start which I think happens in Part 2.  I really enjoyed Part 2.  Although some parts involving eating and animals made me never want to eat meat again, I found it very intriguing.  I couldn't stop reading it.  Martel, the author, has a great way of making something that would seems so boring like being shipwrecked very interesting.  Part 2 made me question what I would have done if I were in a situation similar to Pi (very unlikely).  I'm partial to the ending.  In some ways, it seems like something I would do; however, overall the ending really upset me.  Anyway I would recommend this book.  It was very interesting, and after you finish the novel, it stays in your mind for a while.  Oh just to all those out there who liked the book...there is a movie coming out in 2006!!
B000B8IA2G|2.0|the show is starting to look a little better.But there is no teal\\"c on this show.This kind of makes it sort of boring. I love stargate sg-1,but i cannot get into this show. Maybe it will get better as it goes along.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I enjoyed this show when it first aired on Fox, and I loved it even more after buying the set. I've shown my DVDs to 5 different people, and they bought their own sets! These last two \\"reviewers\\" talked about the writing appealing only to teens, Whedon \\"nonsense\\", mediocre music, etc. They could not be more wrong. This show is meant for the 21 and older crowd, and those who are the more mature at 21 and younger included. For those who expected aliens, scary monsters, grand space battles (the less mature crowd), you may not like Firefly. Or, maybe you will......
B000002J0P|5.0|Man does this album (I still call them that even in CD form) bring me back to college.  We lived in a house that a couch on the front porch (similar to the album cover) and used to pop this album on and sit back and watch the world go by.   <br /> <br />49 Bye -Byes is such a powerful song that gives me chills.  Wooden Ships is another killer track.  Pre-Road Downs is awesome.  Suite: Judy Blue Eyes is harmonizing at its best.  This is a great album that is lost on most of the college age kids today.  It is as smooth and sweet sounding as ever.  If you ever want to take a trip back and forget the hustle/bustle of the rude world we live in today, pop this on and enjoy.          <br />
0375830995|2.0|Hmmmm.<br /><br />First the premise: Ed is a 19 year old taxi driver living a pretty mundane existance until he stops a bank robbery.  His life changes when he starts receiving anonymous aces in the mail with messages on them that he needs to decipher and carry out.<br /><br />Next, its a book for young adults and it did win Book of the Year for older readers from The Children's Book Council of Australia so I suppose thats saying something.  However I didn't enjoy this book as much as everyone else seems to have.  I found that everything worked out much too well for Ed and the story became quite predictable.  I think the book is also a little too long in most places and in the end everything was wrapped up in a neat little package (thats not a spoiler - trust me you could see it coming!)
B00006M183|5.0|As I'm reading the reviews below me, most of them I'm realizing is that they've come into this album with expectations of another \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs\\".  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\"  In fact, they are their best albums, respectively, and \\"Ten\\" is my favorite album of all time.  But when coming into this album, you need to keep an open mind and take into account their recent track record with style.    That said, this album is the culmination and perfection of their work from \\"Vitalogy\\" to \\"Binaural\\".  Many may complain that the \\"rockers\\" don't rock hard enough, but this album isn't meant to jump out of your stereo and hit you hard like their first two albums.  This one is much more melodic and, should I say, experimental.  But what I mean by perfection and culmination of their past works is that this album succeeds where previous PJ albums may have failed.  \\"Vitalogy\\" had some fo the best PJ songs ever, but it was far too inconsistent, and I found myself hitting the skip button many times.  \\"No Code\\" took some getting used to after initial distaste with it, but I really got to like it in time.  However, though it was a bit more consistent than \\"Vitalogy\\", it didn't have as many highlights.  \\"Yield\\" was an awesome effort, with very little filler.  However, outside of \\"Given to Fly\\" and \\"In Hiding\\", all the rest of the material (including \\"Evolution\\", which I couldn't get into at all) was nice to listen to, but by no means as good as it could have been.  \\"Binaural\\" was all around their worst album, with some decent songwriting completely ruined by terrible production.  Still, inconsistent.    Now you've got \\"Riot Act\\", which is a bit different from all the other albums, and takes some time to get into, but after a few listens, you are completely absorbed into the music.  Sure, Vedder doesn't seem to be singing as strongly or passionately as he could, and the album is inexcusably over-political, yet nevertheless the melodies, rhythms, and instruments are some ofthe best that PJ has demonstrated to date.    \\"Can't Keep\\" is a good song with good rhythm and is pretty catchy, but it gets a bit repetitive after its four minutes.  \\"Save You\\" is a song people here appear to be pretty high on, but I really couldn't get into it.  Probably because it tries to be a rocker, yet Vedder doesn't put enough passion into his singing to make it into a good rocker.  \\"Love Boat Captain\\" has some pretty cheesy lyrics, but the melody and verses are oustanding.  A highlight of the album.  \\"Cropduster\\" is one of my favorites, and very underappreciated.  I love the guitar, and the chorus probably has some of Vedder's strongest vocals on the album.  \\"Ghost\\" is a middle-of-the road song.  The \\"away away\\" sung during the chorus is haunting (fitting the title), and I really liked the guitar solo.  \\"I Am Mine\\" is the lone single off this album (the only one, for whatever reason), and it's a really good one.  The strongest song on the album, but not by too much.  The verses don't seem to have much passion to them (only complaint), but the chorus is almost euphoric, and I love the guitar to close out the song.  Probably the most underrated song on the album is \\"Thumbing My Way\\".  With it's acoustic guitar, soothing melody, and lyrics about love and regret, it's probably the most moving song PJ has ever done.  \\"You Are\\" is one of the catchiest and most awesome songs PJ has done to date.  I've never heard a guitar like the one in this song (what did they do to create this effect?).  My only complaint is the vocals are drowned out a little by the guitar.  \\"Get Right\\" sounds like the poppiest song on the album.  Not necessarily a bad thing at all, but the chorus is a little too repetitive, and the lyrics didn't do a thing for me.  \\"Green Disease\\" is where the politics jump in.  It's fast-paced and has a good melody, but the lyrics sound hypocritical (rock stars criticizing rich people?).  \\"Help Help\\" has a haunting chorus, but it didn't really do a thing for me.  I didn't like the vocals.  Did not really get into \\"Bushleaguer\\" either.  I dislike Bush as much as the next guy, but they're not exactly being subtle about it; the verses are also spoken, and Vedder sings the chorus like he's fighting sleep.  I really liked \\"1/2 Full\\".  It has a bluesy guitar, and *shocker* Vedder sings the song like he's actually into it.  \\"Don't see some men as 1/2 empty, see them as 1/2 full of ****.\\"  Despite the conceitedness of this phrase, I laugh every time I hear it.  \\"Arc\\" is universally considered a filler song, but it's a really good filler song, unlike past filler songs.  The album closes out on a bit of a downer with \\"All or None\\".  The song is slow-tempo, which is never bad, but it's another Vedder sleepy song.    In the end, try coming into this album with few expectations.  I was discouraged from buying this one because of what I'd heard, but in the end I'm very glad I did.  \\"I Am Mine\\", \\"Cropduster\\", \\"You Are\\", and \\"Thumbing My Way\\" are some of the best songs PJ has put out.  And for once in the past few albums, these highlights are not surrounded by unlistenable filler material.  Give it a shot.  Just don't expect another \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs.\\"
B0000DJZA5|5.0|\\"Let It Be... Naked\\" has been a great revision of the Beatles final release album, and one now wishes that this was how they went out, rather than with the smudgy ramblings of their original Let It Be album <br /> <br />The original album was a mishmash of recordings and didn't seem to fit together well for a studio album. Heavy orchesteral pieces drowned out some of the tracks, especially \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", making it feel overproduced and plain boring. Other tracks were very rough and sounded like demos rather than album material. <br /> <br />This version of the album certainly retifies these faults, with the over produced tracks cut back and the rough edges smoothed out of the others - the album sounds consistently good all the way through, and low and behold, I have discovered that \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" is not a bland song at all, and is now one of my favourites. <br /> <br />The track listing has been reorganised, and the album certainly seems to play better in this order; it begins by blasting out \\"Get Back\\" and finishes with \\"Let It Be\\", a fitting finale for the album with its namesake. <br /> <br />I particularly liked the inclusion of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", as this track was from this period and always sounded like it should of been on the original Let It Be album. <br /> <br />My only quirks are that I prefer the song \\"Get Back\\" to start with the live banter that was in the original, and that the bonus disc could of had a few more completed tracks on it, not just studio ramblings (interesting as they may be)- perhaps some remastered live tracks from their rooftop concert or something like that <br /> <br />The album is a great buy for both the casual and serious Beatle fan, it sounds quite fresh, and you certainly won't be disappointed with this addition to your Beatles cataloge. <br /> <br />

B00000HZFP|5.0|This whole album is filled with so much emotion it makes you weep.  Both the stage version and the film soundtrack are great albums if you are a fan of the show or not.  No matter what anyone's personal views are or what they feel about the subject matter, you can't help but feel for this character and go with him/her on the journey.   <br />  The songs are angry, beautiful and full of raw emotion.  Who doesn't understand \\"Wicked Little Town\\" sometimes?
1558908382|5.0|Grosse Point Blank is a great movie about a hitman coming back home for his 10 high school reunion. Cusak delivers his funniest performance since Better Off Dead. Its been 10 years since anyone from the town of Grosse Point has heard from Cusaks character now he returns to the girl (Minnie Driver) he ditched at prom and the friends he just kinda disappeared on to not only attne dhis high school reunion but to do his job as a hitman until he has several run ins with his old coworkers enter Dan Akroyd who try to convicne him to join a hitman union Cusak refuses and the laughs begin I would reccomend this movie to anyone who just likes wacky comedy
B00022M518|5.0|Anyone who has seen Velvet Goldmine will know half the songs on this album right off the bat.  Needle in the Camel's Eye, Baby's on Fire, and Dead finks don't talk were all in that movie.  Though Deak Fink wasn't on the soundtrack.  (odd that) <br /> <br />  Eno made something very unique and special when he made this album.  All the songs are unlike any other song ever made.  \\"Dead Finks Don't Talk\\" is like a funk rock song from some other world.  And \\"Some far away beach\\" is one of the most beautiful songs ever made.  By the time the vocals come in on it you feel like crying.  It just builds up emotion with just music at first. <br />  Jems like this album are what is to miss about the 70's
B0009I7NNA|1.0|When i got this CD, i seriously thought it was a joke. It was so cheese filled and their names were so hilarious. When i heard \\"strength of the world\\" i had to turn it off. It was just too much. \\"ICE IN MY VEINS!\\" Are these guys from green bay? <br />Yes, they can play their instruments. That's about it. This has got to be one of the most cheesy CD's i've ever heard. Assrock, buttrock, hair rock with double bass and a little of G'N'R is all this CD is. It's nothing new, we've all heard it before. <br />This isn't metal. This is new age assrock. This is metal for the wannbees watching MTV that think eyeliner and black clothes are cool. Go listen to real metal bands like, Converge, Ion dissonance, The Red Chord, Glass Casket, Myrkskog, Yattering, Into the Moat, etc, etc. <br />A7x gives metal a band name. But i'm sure all the kiddies watching MTV will think it's the best thing since Slipknot(LOL, they suck too).
0141439513|5.0|Okay, I admit it:  I read Pride and Prejudice in high school and didn't like it.  However, age and the wisdom that comes with it helped me to realize that my dislike of the book probably had more to do with my dislike of my then-teacher, who had the ability to make even the greatest literary masterpiece seem dry and dull.  In recent years, I've read most of Jane Austen's other novels and have enjoyed them immensely, and so I have finally worked my way back to Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />The story is familiar to most:  it centers around the five young Bennett sisters, who range in age from their mid-teens to early twenties, making them quite ripe for marriage (at least according to their mother).  And then there are the men, for as the novel's opening line notes: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"  Such a man, Mr. Bingley, buys a house close to the Bennett family, and initially, he seems fated to marry the oldest, loveliest Bennett girl, Jane.  Bingley is accompanied by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy, who, while possessing an even greater fortune, quickly earns the dislike of all those he meets, particularly Elizabeth, the strong-minded second Bennett daughter.  And from the pride held by each of the four principle characters described above (but namely Darcy and Elizabeth), Austen derives her prejudice.<br /><br />In many ways, Pride and Prejudice reads like a modern-day romantic comedy, complete with misunderstandings and mishaps.  Similarly, the embarrassment which Jane and Elizabeth suffer at the hands of their mother and younger sisters would make them perfect candidates for today's reality TV.  But of course, Austen's writing contains a level of wit and subtlety rarely found in any contemporary form of entertainment, making this novel is a true classic-a rare gem that still shines brightly to this day.
B0006399FS|5.0|Well. I guess I should start by saying I'm 27 years old and have been listening to U2 since I was 10. I find it funny that I am absolutely in love with one of the most popular bands in the world, but rarely agree with anyone on their music. For example, since the day it came out, 1993's Zooropa has been my favorite U2 cd. I absolutley love Pop and am always shocked by people's reaction to it. I thought that 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind, hailed as the band's return to glory, was 5 good songs and then a lot of filler. But, I was sure How to Dismantle... would be revered as a classic. I definitley thought the average review would be better than 3/5. <br />It hasn't even been out a year and I think I've already lisened to Dismantle... more than the previous album. The first 5 songs are incredible (I do think knowing the stories behind \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" really help you appreciate them).  <br />But, unlike All That You Can't Leave Behind, this new one doesn't fall apart at the end. When I listen to this cd, it often takes 2 hours because I want to hear most of the songs twice.  <br />If I had to recommend U2's studio albums to a newcomer, I'd say chronological order is the way to go, to see how the band progressed. But, in terms of quality, I'd say 1.Zooropa 2.How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb 3.Acthung Baby 4.The Joshua Tree 5.Pop 6.Boy 7.The Unforgettable Fire (A Sort of Homecoming---what an underrated gem, I wish they'd start doing it live) 8.All That You... 9.War 10.October. <br />All are good, mind you, except October hasn't really aged well.
0345350499|5.0|This book takes time to read, but it is def. worth it. A great story, told from a new and fresh point of view. By the end you feel like you personally know all of the characters and you are very invested in them, caring about what happens to them and their lives. I love this book. If you like classical tales or mythology, this is the book for you.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Playing the Angel in my opinion is the best album from Depeche Mode in 11 years, since the release of Songs of Faith and Devotion. There are hints of their past on tracks like A Pain That I am Used to, Suffer Well, and the Sinner In Me. After a weak effort in the last studio album, Exciter, Playing the Angel redeems Depeche Mode and satisfies true fans with the sound that we have come to expect from this epic group.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Finally, after a much too long break, Depeche Mode has returned in 2005 with \\"Playing the Angel\\", their best album since 1993's \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\". While their 1997 release \\"Ultra\\" suffered from inconsistency, and their 2001 record \\"Exciter\\" had a hollow production and a tendency to be Depeche-lite, \\"Playing the Angel\\" is a definite return to form for the band. <br /> <br />The album opens up with the frightening sirens of \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\", a song so shockingly fierce that it reminds us that the band can still kick it into overdrive. The chorus is very reminiscent of their mid 80's anthems, but as it ends, an insane cacophony of distorted guitars breaks out, driving the song into \\"concert-opener\\" status. <br /> <br />The album moves on with \\"John the Revelator\\", a wonderfully catchy song with excellent production via Ben Hillier (Doves, Blur) who helps turns this upbeat stomper into an instant classic. This song is unlike anything I've heard by the band, but seems like it is what \\"Personal Jesus\\" would sound like on LSD.  <br /> <br />The album is the first of the band's to include compositions by singer Dave Gahan, as he lends his hand with \\"Suffer Well\\", \\"I Want it All\\", and \\"Nothing's Impossible\\". \\"Suffer Well\\" is an interesting fast paced number with excellent vocals by both Gahan (lead) and Gore (backing). The atmosphere created here of heavenly darkness is classic Mode. What follows is \\"The Sinner in Me\\", a sinister sounding song with brooding vocals by Gahan. Its dreary grooves sway you in and out as the synths pulse alongside Gore's distorted guitar line.  <br /> <br />The album's first single, \\"Precious\\", arguably one of the year's most infectious songs, is the safe trademark Depeche Mode song. It has a hypnotic guitar riff and a sing-along chorus that you'd be hard pressed to forget. Hillier showcases his production here, as the sounds blend and ease the song along smoothly. The lyrical content of the track, dealing with Gore's divorceand its effect on his children, shows this album was written in a dark place for him. The album hits the halfway mark with \\"Macro\\", a Gore sung track, which is one of the few missteps of the album. Though it is nice to see on the track, oddly enough, Gahan does backing vocals. <br /> <br />\\"I Want it All\\", Gahan's second penned track, is like what the singer's solo album tried and failed at sounding like, but here, he succeeds. It's very dark and gloomy, with a crisp beat and some bizarre synth sounds. The album is surely the most organic the band has made in quite some time, and the use of analogue synths over digital shows in songs like this and \\"Nothing's Impossible\\". \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" is Gahan's darkest of his three tracks, with its creepy sounds and disturbingly beautiful chorus. It's sure to be a real crowd pleaser. The sole instrumental on the album, \\"Introspectre\\", is like every Depeche instrumental on an album; in other words, it's practically throwaway, but is useful in transition and keeping the pace during the full album listen. The second track with Gore on lead vocals, \\"Damaged People\\", is the better of the two, and has him at his crooning best. <br /> <br />While the previous two albums suffered from weaker second halves, \\"Playing the Angel\\" keeps the flow throughout. The quick paced \\"Lillian\\" with Gahan's vocals masked with a vocoder displays this. It will definitely get your head nodding as the beats click and smash. The album closes with the 7 minute epic goth of \\"The Darkest Star\\", which is both cryptic sounding and vividly powerful at the same time. It helps put the finishing touches on a 50+ minute album that never feels long. <br /> <br />There is no doubt that this is a five star album by Depeche Mode standards, and anyone else's for that matter. This is a necessary buy as it's arguably the best album of the year, and it's a refreshing sight to see a 25 year old band continue to stay fresh and vibrant while still pleasing both their dedicated fans and the constant-changing masses. If you've stuck along to read this entire review, you've wasted time that could have been better spent listening to this glorious album!
B00005BJ9W|3.0|Thanks to J.Brady's review, I now know why this version of Rio does not match either my vinyl LP copy or cassette. As both of those formats are harder to replace once they wear out, I was greatly looking forward to getting Rio on CD and playing the hell out of it.  Boy was I shocked to hear the CD mix.  As in \\"What the hell?!!!\\" shocked.   <br /> <br />\\"Bassically\\" {pun intended} the bass is not as pronounced on tracks like \\"Rio\\" or \\"Lonely In Your Nightmare\\", and even \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\".  Track two, \\"My Own Way\\", varies from the American version in that the keyboard track that underlies the openning bass track, is missing and doesn't kick in until the whole band does.  All in all, if you grew up listening to this album, the CD will not sound like the album you remember well. That isn't to say the CD is not good.  Its decent and you'll get to hear what the rest of the world heard back in 1982. It'll just leave you wondering, like me, if you can find someone to burn you a CD copy of your vinyl album. <br /> <br />Oh, and regarding the poster who says dump Rio in favor of Rush's \\"2112\\":  I have both and enjoy both equally, thank you very much, and would easily see Duran Duran one night after seeing Rush the night before!
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Sure, you can hear Radiohead and other influences in this album. But whose album have you ever heard that hasn't had some influence? I think a lot of their sound is orginal. They're original because they have taken about 5 different styles and molded it together to make their own. I remember a little band named Stone Temple Pilots that people thought was a Pearl Jam rip-off. I listen to it today and can't hear a single bit of PJ. So the point is listen to this Muse album more than once and you can tell it is the Muse, not Radiohead or any other.
0312958455|3.0|This is a nice book but the end of this novel leaves you wondering.  My precise point is that the ending doesn't make a whole lotta sense.  Sure, he finds the perp, but it doesn't explain the other peoples intentions or actions which actually cause the perp to kill.  I just didn't think that it added up.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book was well written and a fun read.  But one couldn't compare it to The Black Echo or The Concrete Blonde.
B00005JNJV|5.0|While watching this film in IMAX this summer, I noticed a couple of things about Batman Begins: The smartest move Hollywood has made in years; they dumped Joel Schumacher and his campy film tricks out the nearest window, got a REAL actor to play Batman (rent Equilibrium after watching this film); and used a great screenplay that told a STORY.  <br /> <br />Heck, even the Scarecrow is really scary in the film. It makes me wonder what could now be done with the Riddler and Two-Face if the two screen writers, Goyer and Nolan, decided to re-make the last two awful Batman films. <br /> <br />I don't blame you if you are doubting the quality of this film, I walked out of the last one (what a waste of THREE good Batman villians). Trust me, this one is great. <br /> <br />Buy this film, it is worth every penny even if you are not a Batman fan.

B00005NB8K|2.0|Hey, I know I'm in the minority in my opinion here on Amazon, yet I will state unequivocally my view that the portrayal of Jim Morrison, his common-law wife Pamela Courson, the group, and even the supporting cast of regulars in The Doors Universe come off like characters in search of a serious screenwriter.   <br /> <br />Come on already, Oliver.  Who could sympathize with Jim and Company when they spew out lines of dialogue clipped, of all places, from Morrison's song lyrics?  Did you actually think an audience would accept Jim uttering such discordant lines in an everyday conversation?  Could you not separate the man from the performer?  Because of that awful bit of writing, Jim comes off like a buffoon, not an erudite talent who, despite a lifetime of loneliness, alienation, and addictive tendencies (which would ultimately snuff out his life), still managed to push aside material comfort for a pursuit of the truth as he saw it. <br /> <br />Also, how come Jim revels in such horrible psychobabble?  Had you not gleamed the interviews (available through Bright Midnight and other retailers) you'd hear an incredibly bright, articulate young man who lamented the day he elected to be part of a rock and roll band.  You'd also have the makings of excellent drama, as a man who cannot escape his fame and a man who longed to create films and poetry in his own right. <br /> <br />How could one ever sympathize with a drunken lout (YOUR Jim) who acts like an ass (seems more like Val Kilmer playing himself rather than Jim), shows no compassion whatsoever, and just appears to become famous in one quick turn of events.  The only clue we have to the success stems from the Sullivan show, the airport raid, and assorted concerts, but we never get a sense of Jim being nationally lambasted.  Some archival footage might have helped there.  But of course then the more sedate, intelligent Morrison--whom you portrayed as bumping into cops whereas Jim preferred to sway at a mike stand (see the archival footage)--doesn't figure in a Hollywood biopic. <br /> <br />What a shame.  What a rotten, dirty, salacious mess.  Maybe your own demons got the better of your good sense, Oliver.  God knows, if your Morrison had been the true Morrison, I'd never had been a fan of his in the first place.  Thanks for turning Jim into David Lee Roth, the members of KISS, Robert Plant, and all those other Circus Magazine posterboys for rock and roll excess.  Too bad.  An integrity, a nonmaterial nature, and a sincere attraction to make art distinguishes Jim from all those other Sex, Drug, and Rock and Roller hellions.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|First of all, the editor who wrote the first review is incorrect--Martin did not write every song on the album.  For the first time, there are three tracks written by Dave Gahan (\\"I Want it All,\\" \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" and \\"Suffer Well\\"), whose song-writing abilities were demonstrated on Paper Monsters.  In fact, \\"Suffer Well\\" is one of the best tracks, along with \\"John the Revelator\\" and \\"Precious.\\"  The album is a wonderful listen.  Sadly, DM often is incorrectly labeled as an 80's band.  Some of their best albums, including Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion were released in the 90's.  The songs are a natural development for DM and you can hear some of the experimental work Martin has been perfecting.  For example, \\"Lilian\\" is remniscent of \\"I Cast A Lonely Shadow from Martin's Counterfeit 2 ep. DM has outdone themselves this time.
B000AADYYO|5.0|After 2003's Damnation introduced a seemingly kinder, gentler Opeth to the world, you might've thought Mikael Akerfeldt and Co. had gone soft.  Well, if so, you would've thought wrong, because Opeth aren't just back to metal with the new Ghost Reveries, they're better at it than ever before.  While I was a huge fan of theirs a few years ago, my interest had sort of wanted recently, even if I do still think they've released some great albums (most notably Still Life and Damnation).  Here, though, they achieve a level of focus and intensity unprecedented in their catalogue.  Ghost Reveries is, simply put, their most original, interesting, and brilliant album.<br /><br />Ghost Reveries is also Opeth's most aggressively proggy release to date-I don't know about anyone else, but listening to this album I was struck by thoughts of Nevermore, Arch Enemy, Isis, and the Mars Volta, even though Opeth don't actually sound like any of those bands-and therefore can take several listens to adequately get your head around.  Not that your time won't be well spent, though, as Ghost Reveries is a remarkable leap forward for a band that had already been long since marked as innovators.  Opeth have been known since their beginnings for their wide range of emotions and their extensive alternation of sounds, but on previous albums the dynamics tended to be of a HEAVY-light-HEAVY-light-HEAVY variety that got rather comfortable after a while.  Here, though, everything is integrated much more seamlessly, exploring a stylistic range that takes Opeth well beyond the status of \\"that band that mixes death metal, folk, and prog rock.\\"<br /><br />Opeth do still mix styles with abandon on Ghost Reveries, but the patterns are varied considerably more this time around, with multiple sonic shifts per song, some of which can take a while to pinpoint.  As a result, Ghost Reveries is a lot less predictable than what came before it-listening to albums like Still Life and Blackwater Park, I could settle into a heavier or lighter passage secure in the knowledge that it would probably continue for a while, but that's not so here.  As tradeoffs go it's a worthy one-there's a lot more of a sturm and drang effect here; the death vocals hit harder for their sparser distribution; and the instrumental passages give you a lot more to chew on.  Not to mention, the band's compositional style is just a lot more interesting here, with tighter songwriting highlighted by inceasingly intricate riff structures and guitar harmonies and some azz-kicking solos.  For the first time, I can safely say that every second of an Opeth album is made to count.<br /><br />The first two tracks-Ghost of Perdition, The Baying of the Hounds-are somewhat prototypical Opeth epics, but even then some changes are evident.  Even during the heavier parts, there's more of a melodic metal approach, with Mikael's clean vocals (previously used almost exclusively for soft passages) making frequent appearances.  Still, these tracks exemplify the band's traditional balance of viciousness and majesty, effortlessly incorporating bowel-shaking growls, gorgeous guitar melodies, and dizzyingly technical instrumental interludes while sweeping keyboard textures, gentle atmospherics, and screaming solos weave their way in and out of the mix.  And it may just be my new stereo talking, but I don't recall the bass work being as prominent or interesting on previous albums as it is on this one.<br /><br />Beneath the Mire, while superficially not that different from the two songs that come before it, is still probably the most rabidly experimental thing on here, shifting mood and tone every minute or so, interspersing head-banging metal with gorgeous vocal melodies and emotionally charged guitar leads, and closing with a bizarre, free-jazzy instrumental passage that wouldn't sound out of place on a Meshuggah CD.  And although it sounds a lot different, the first all-nice track Atonement continues in the same vein.  In sharpcontrast to the pleasant but often lightweight tunes that generally provided a break from all the heaviness in the past, Atonement is a hypnotic, densely layered ambient piece driven by Eastern-accented guitar work, subtle keyboard flourishes, and even some hand drums and piano (never thought I'd hear that combination on an Opeth album).  Another classic, the Grand Conjuration, steadily builds tension with some hushed, eerie melodies and foreboding clean vocals before releasing it with flurries of death vox, crazy Meshuggah-style polyrhythms (there's that name again), and ghostly keyboards.  For its part, Isolation Years is a pretty nice closer; Akerfeldt's vocals get a little too close to the top of his register for my tastes, but the purty guitar leads and tricky drumming make the song register just enough.<br /><br />Alright, I'm too bored and full of caffeine to write a suitable closing to this review now, so I'll just leave you with this: if you like Opeth, get this album.  It's their best one yet, and easily among my prestigious personal top 5 of the year thus far..

B000001GK9|5.0|In terms of value, this famous 1982 live performance of the Mahler Ninth is no bargain compared to the studio version Karajan made just two years previously. Not only is the studio version part of a bargain two-fer, but it includes as filler some excellent mid-Seventies performances of Mahler songs with the wonderful Christa Ludwig.<br /><br />Critics have gravitated to this live Ninth, despite its high price, as the better of the two, although the Gramophone awarded both the same prize when they came out. So the Amazon reviewer's comment that the studio version was \\"so-so\\" is ridiculous--the Gramophone itself declares that it is difficult to pick between the two. Karajan didn't change his basic tempos (mostly quite broad) or his somewhat detached Apollonian view of the score--detached, that is, compared to the totally involving and emotionally untempered Bernstein, also with Berlin, from 1979. What other orchestra can claim to have made three great Mahler Ninths in the space of three years!<br /><br />What Bernstein misses that Karajan abundantly supplies is astonishing clarity, virtuosic orchestral playing that stands above any other version on CD, and a total command of line and balance. Those qualities count for a lot, and they are present in both sets. I do think, listening to them side by side, that Karajan got more of everything from the Berlin Phil. under live concert conditions--the whole thing feels more spontaneous, spacious, and alert on the musicians' part. But here we are comparing two superlative accounts. In terms of recorded sound, the digital 1982, as remastered here, is excellent in every way, while the earlier analog recording is a bit studio bound with less air and space around the individual instruments.<br /><br />All in all, these readings are so stupendous in their musicality and virtuosity that it's worth buying them both.
0740748475|5.0|Don't think I could add a whole lot more to what's already been said about the collection.   However, one point thats been slightly understated is the weight. The package is big, heavy and unweildy. With each book weighing just over 7 lbs., God Forbid if you drop one of 'em on your foot.  Also, if you're buying the collection to READ the stories, it would make more sense to buy the individual books (as many fans, including myself already have the other books and bought this as a collectors item - this is something you want preserved, not dog-eared in a year). There is a website out there that specifically lists which of the C&H books you would need to have in order to own every single strip without duplicates.    But having said all that, and aside from any doting fanglorious discourse, what I really liked about the collection was that:  1) Since it has the strip in chronological order, its the first opportunity to watch how Bill Watterson's artwork and style evolved over the years. It also gives you the chance to see when new characters and alter-egos of Calvin were introduced into the strip- I was a kid when C&H ran in my newspaper so I dont remember whether Rosalyn came in right from the beginning or at the end of the series, etc.  2) The lengthy preface by the reclusive Watterson is itself worth the cost of the book. Hearing his take on how the strip came about, his philosophy on things and  his piece on why he was against merchandising the characters, are all priceless bits of information. Happy Reading!  An intersting bit of C&H trivia - Hampster Huey & the Gooey Kablooie really is a book (and you can buy it on Amazon too!).
B0006L16N8|2.0|\\"Parachute\\"s and \\"A rush ..\\" were better than this album. It sounds like they recycled some of their old songs and made it more slow paced. <br /> <br />All the songs are boring. I almost fell asleep listening to this album many times.  <br /> <br />A BIG YAWN
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Avril's, and I loved her debut album Let Go. The second album, Under My Skin wasn't a dissapointment either. It's hard to tell whitch is better!!  <br />Let Go was more a pop record, but Under My Skin is more rock. But, the second CD has still many pop-rock songs, for example Don't tell me, My happy ending and Nobody's home. But all the other songs are great, too! <br />My favorites are: <br />-Don't tell me <br />-Take me away <br />-Who knows <br />-Fall to pieces <br />-He wasn't <br />Avril's very talented singer and I can't wait for her next CD! Her conserts are awesome, too! <br />You should buy this really good CD! It rocks!!
B000B5XOYI|1.0|The only old Batman movie that was remotely decent was the first Batman, but Jack played a horrible Joker. I mean Tommy Lee Jones played a better Joker than Jack Nicholson, too bad Jones was suppose to be playing Two-Face, a guy that was suppose to be calm and collective in his plan not a silly clown killing people randomly. I don't really have a comment on the Pengiun played by Devito. I never really liked the character to begin with. <br /> <br />And then it goes straight down from there. Batman Returns was horrible, and it doesn't take a comic fan to see it. Penguins with friggin missiles on their back? WTF?! <br /> <br />And the number one thing I really hated was Burton's Batman loved to kill. The thing that makes Batman what he is is that he does not kill, he does not sink to the level of the criminals. There was one scene where a thug threw a grenade at Bats and Bats kicked it back to him. And to top it all off, Bats SMILED as if he were a psychopath! WTF? <br /> <br />And then there's the neon lights in Forever and Robin and the worst acting possible. Arnold as Freeze is the worst casting decision I have ever seen. What the heck was Schumacher thinking?

B00009V7P8|3.0|Rice is walking the right path tread by earlier folk troubadours and classical songwriters, but fails on orchestrations and additional voices.  These ostentations essentially ruin the well structured ballads as well as the entire CD.   <br /> <br />The delivery is remeniscent of the Red House Painters, in that the lyrics don't flow with the music. But that's ok. Its folk. Unfortunately, the lyrics aren't exactly the best ones on the market either.  <br /> <br />The best place to listen to this CD is on a back country road driving to work or the grocery store. Don't expect to drop everything to earnestly listen to his soothes.
B000002HAJ|5.0|I've been a hardcore Cure fan for about 15 years and I bought \\"Wish\\" when it first came out. I listen to it from time to time and I'm always struck by how fresh, intricate, and inspired it sounds. There isn't one bad track on the album, from \\"Open\\" to \\"End.\\" The music the Cure created on this album is thicker and more complex, with layer upon layer of interweaving guitar, than on any of their other albums. Porl Thompson, who later went on to outshine his guitar idol Jimmy Page on tour with Page and Plant, along with Perry Bamonte, who had recently been asked to play guitar with the Cure after playing the role of their guitar roadie for a number of years, provide the background guitar work over which Smith's signature guitar sound shines through, specifically on \\"High.\\" \\"Wish\\" has some of Smith's best lyrics that spin tales of drunken euphoria (\\"Open\\"), hopeless heartache (\\"Apart\\" and \\"Trust\\"), loves lost (\\"A Letter to Elise\\" and \\"To Wish Impossible Things\\"), and blissful adoration (\\"High\\"). The music and lyrics meld together like a hand in a glove, not sounding forced like some later Cure material, but natural and perfectly suited for each other. \\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea\\" is the standout track on \\"Wish,\\" with it's complex lead guitar solos building to a climax and Smith's impassioned vocals almost screaming \\"I wish I could just stop, I know another moment will break my heart ... miles and miles and miles away from home again.\\" Listening to \\"Wish\\" loud while driving is always a pleasure that takes me back to the first time I heard it in 1992. It's amazing that so much time has passed and yet there are always new aspects of \\"Wish\\" I discover each time I listen to it.

B000069HZP|5.0|This film has the power to reward endlessly. It is one to watch more and more, because as you do so, you enjoy it more and more. Much like the best games.At a superficial level, a psychological thriller, but as is usual with Fincher's films, it goes way beyond that. 'Alien 3' did much the same for me. At first viewing I was deeply underwhelmed. This was as in part due to James Cameron's phenonomenal 'Alien's', as it was to Fincher's unique cinematic style. His style again came to the fore in 'Panic Room', his film after 'The Game.' <br /> <br />However the cause for initial lack of love for the film, again probably is due to his previous masterpiece, 'Seven'. 'The Game' does take some getting into, but on repeated viewing has the capacity to reward viewers, not only with superlative acting perfomances, but a great script and a pace that is deliberately slow enough to make the viewer share Michael Douglas' sense of torment and unease at where his 'game' is all going. A must see, for those who enjoy an alternative, intelligent drama/thriller and want to ponder life's big questions.Well worth the investment.
6300215741|5.0|This travel brochure to adventure and romance is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining films. The gorgeous vistas of the French Riviera are matched perfectly by the stunning duo of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Robert Burks' cinematography was nominated for an Academy Award and Edith Head gives Grace Kelly the look of an American princess. A fine screenplay from Michael Hayes based on a novel by David Dodge, and a light romantic score from Lyn Murray combine with all the other elements to make this a true film classic.<br /><br />American John Robie (Cary Grant) has been living well in a beautiful villa on the French Riviera for the past 15 years. Once the most notorious thief in France, the man known as \\"The Cat\\" has been quiet for many years. He was in prison during the war when the Germans bombed it. He chose to stay and fight with the French Resistance upon his escape, and became a legend. It led to his parole, which is rather precarious now that a string of jewel robberies mimicking his exact style are occuring on the rooftops of the rich.<br /><br />The French police want him for it, and his old pals are angry that he's brought them this unwanted attention after all these years. Since the only way to clear himself is to catch the thief himself, he hooks up with an insurance agent whose company is paying out the claims on all the robberies and begins a game of cat and mouse with the thief. The cheese in the trap is the delicious Grace Kelly.<br /><br />Francie Stevens (Kelly) and her mother, Jessie (Jesse Royce Landis), are vacationing on the Riviera. Robie, posing as a lumber tycoon from Oregon, wants to keep they and their diamonds company until the thief strikes. Francie throws off his game, however, when she learns early on who he really is and displays a wild enthusiasm for helping him steal! Robie isn't there to steal, of course, but has trouble convincing Francie of that when her mother's jewels are stolen. Coming on the heels of a romantic interlude between the two, it is especially insulting.<br /><br />That evening together is framed beautifully by Hitchcock, cutting back and forth between the fireworks outside on the Riviera and the fireworks going on inside. Kelly is like a playful kitten with a gleam in her eye, and Grant the older cat, who's seen her kind of kitten before and isn't sure he wants to play. There is a wonderful chemistry between the two, who seemed to be made for each other on the screen. A wild ride in her sports car along the coast that has Robie a little worried and a picnic in elegant dress are a treat to watch.<br /><br />Complicating matters is another sexy kitten, Danielle Foussard (Brigitte Auber). She is the daughter of one of his old pals (Jean Martinelli) and would like nothing better than to run off with Robie to South America. But she is a different kind of kitten, perhaps harder to handle than Francie. When her father is murdered and pegged as the thief, she lashes out at Robie at his funeral. By this time, Francie's wise mom has set her straight about Robie, and together they set a trap for the real thief at a posh costume ball.<br /><br />It will lead to an exciting and entertaining chase on the rooftops as Robie unmasks the imposter. Since he's enlisted Francie's help this time, he is forced to admit he may not be the lone wolf he thought he was. There is a terrific conclusion as everyone gets what they want, especially the viewer. Look quick for Hitch on the back seat of the bus Grant uses to evade the police! This is elegant escapist entertainment that you can't help but fall in love with. A marvelous film to get lost in on any weekend.especially insulting.

Complicating matters is another sexy kitten, Danielle Foussard (Brigitte Auber). She is the daughter of one of his old pals (Jean Martinelli) and would like nothing better than to run off with Robie to South America. But she is a different kind of kitten, perhaps harder to handle than Francie. When her father is murdered and pegged as the thief, she lashes out at Robie at his funeral. By this time, Francie's wise mom has set her straight about Robie, and together they set a trap for the real thief at a posh costume ball.     It will lead to an exciting and entertaining chase on the rooftops as Robie unmasks the imposter. Since he's enlisted Francie's help this time, he is forced to admit he may not be the lone wolf he thought he was. There is a terrific conclusion as everyone gets what they want, especially the viewer. Look quick for Hitch on the back seat of the bus Grant uses to evade the police! This is elegant escapist entertainment that you can't help but fall in love with. A marvelous film to get lost in on any weekend.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|alright. this guy makes a few good points. it IS good. Unearth ARE talented...but the buck stops there. everything else is WRONG. unlike chimaira...unearth is a good band. and unearth is not influenced by Chimaira at all either...smalls, you're killing me here...seriously, dude...no. just simply, no. and to recommend The Oncoming Storm to serious metal fans and not casual metalcore fans is ludicrous...who the hell will buy it if not casual metalcore fans??? the real metalheads will complain it's not metallica or pantera...metalcore kids will like the breakdowns and the screaming and such...this was probably, along with Bury Your Dead's cover your tracks, the best metalcore cd to drop last year, fo sho. choosing standout tracks i'd say #1, 3, 5,...the whole damn cd. it was good, Unearth is good...get their other cds too, and forget what that guy said...don't let a Chimaira comparison stop you from getting a good cd...i hate Chimaira...this is metal.
B000B2YQX4|1.0|Listen, I'm a big Depeche Mode fan and I don't know what these people praising this album are talking about. Every song is either slow or very slow, filled with lots of weird synth noises and distortion. There's so much distortion in the first track I thought that I bought a defective CD. These guys are quite capable of writing great songs and there isn't any here. But hey, if you like dreary songs that lack melody with lots of weird noises in them, then by all means, who'll love this. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000063DI9|5.0|This is Maiden's 2nd attempt with using synthesizers and their first (and the only one so far) concept album. Got out in '88, and it is really their best progressive album. I think the band made a right step making this album, since here they proved they can also be great as a progressive band, whereas in their first attempt with it (Somewhere in Time) it just didn't work. Actually this album had the best production from the first 9 albums. The best song here is the title track, this one is mind blowing, it is very similar to 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' (off Powerslave) and 'Alexander the Great' (off Somewhere in Time) but here the story was written by Maiden, the real fun starts in the 7th min of the song, it has plenty guitar solos, and the riffs in the end are amazing. The album starts off with Moonchild which is a great starter just like 'Prowler', 'Where Eagles Dare', 'Aces High' and 'Wickerman' (BTW the best off them). 'Can I Play With Madness' is another happy Maiden song like 'Holy Smoke' (off No Prayer), and 'Run to the Hills' (Beast). 'The Evil That Men Do' is the 2nd hit off the album, in the same vein as CIPWM and maybe even better. It closes off with 'Only The Good Die Young' which is great but not an epic like Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Hallowed Be Thy Name. Dave and Adrian also done well here, I think their best work is in Powerslave but it is way better than in Somewhere. Bruce was also good here, but  his vocals are not insane as they where in his 3 first Maiden albums. Sadly, after this album Adrian left and they released 4 weak albums up to 1999, well 'Fear of the Dark' was good, X Factor was decent. They had 2 failing albums: No Prayer was poor, it had 2 good songs, all the other are nothing special and boring, and Virtual XI was actually bad, well it was not \\"St. Anguish\\" but yet a pathetic release (it had 2 good songs, but all the rest songs are actually bad, unlike No Prayer).  This is how I rate the songs...  Moonchild- 10/10  InfiniteDreams- 9/10  Can I Play with Madness- 10/10  The Evil Men That Do- 10/10  7th Son of a 7th Son- 20/10  The Prophecy- 10/10  The Clairvoyant- 9/10  Only The Good Die Young- 9/10  PS there are no bad tracks here, this is a must own masterpiece. Well, what are you doing reading this?! Go buy it now!
6305364648|4.0|This James Cameron action-adventure starts with a bang and ends with one, but gets sidetracked along the way in a subplot that adds little to the overall value. Schwarzenegger stars as a secret agent, with Jamie Lee Curtis as his unsuspecting wife, Tom Arnold as his sidekick and Bill Paxton as a sleazebag used car salesman who tries to seduce wife Jamie Lee by posing as a special agent himself. Although this part of the plot is entertaining, it takes us away from the main plot - which is about stopping a terrorist splinter group that's gone nuclear - for almost an hour. We practically have to remind ourselves whom the terrorists are when they return.<br /><br />We open on a James Bond type scene in a European chateau, which includes Arnold doing a tango with a beautiful artifacts dealer while Tom waits impatiently in the van. Arnold realizes she's really an agent, as he investigates her further; but when she discovers who he is, she has him tailed into a restroom by assassins, where a great fight scene ensues, followed by a terrific chase sequence - with the bad guy on a motorcycle and Arnold on horseback - through town, into a hotel, up an elevator and off a roof. There are unbelievable stunts - in both senses of the word - with the horse, in this case, stealing the show.<br /><br />If the film had continued in this direction, it would have been much better, because the secret agent world of Arnold and Tom is full of cool gadgets, danger and a boss who can't be pleased, played by Charlton Heston. Plus, the two men make a great team. Tom is likeable as he tries to give Arnold advice on marriage and child rearing - none of it encouraging, but all of it funny. Arnold and Tom use their secret agent skills to discourage Bill from pursuing Jamie Lee; and, although Paxton is funny, and his scenes are entertaining, they cause the main plot to lose momentum. A better job at editing could possibly have solved the problem, as the movie tends to run a little long. (It's nearly two-and-a-half hours.) The movie begins with a tango scene and it ends, wonderfully, the same way.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithnearly two-and-a-half hours.)

0060734191|5.0|Garth Nix delves into the dark heart of high fantasy in the Abhorsen Trilogy, three interconnected fantasies about a family of necromancers who lay the dead -- and forces of evil -- to rest. Humour, detailed writing and deep characters, along with a richly-realize world, make this a classic-in-the-making.<br /><br />\\"Sabriel\\" is the story of a teenage girl living happily at a girl's school, while her necromancer father (the Abhorsen) roams around putting the dead to rest. All that changes when a sending brings her father's sword and bells, meaning that he is dead or incapacitated. So Sabriel takes on her father's duties, accompanied by a Free Magic cat and a mysterious young prince, and battles the specter of a horrible evil creature that is reaching out from death to snare her.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" takes us to the cold citadel of the Clayr, a race of seers. Young Lirael is depressed because she doesn't have the gift of Sight yet, even though everybody else her age does. But things take a sinister turn when she sets a horrifying, bloodthirsty creature loose, and must work -- with the help of the mysterious Disreputable Dog -- to get rid of it. But what Lirael doesn't know is that the outside world is in danger too, from a sinister new enemy.<br /><br />\\"Abhorsen\\" brings the series to an explosive conclusion. Lirael and her nephew Sameth -- along with \\"cat\\" Mogget and the Disreputable Dog -- are in danger from the Dead. What's more, the Destroyer Orannis has escaped from his prison and is being assisted by an evil necromancer and the Dead called Chlorr -- and an unfortunate pal of Sameth's. Now Lirael must call on her destiny as the future Abhorsen, and kill the Destroyer.<br /><br />Garth Nix had only written a couple of books, one of which was an \\"X-Files\\" novelization, when the first Abhorsen book burst onto the fantasy scene. Now he's one of the most respected, prolific and well-liked fantasy writers in years, with his single books in print and two hit series for younger readers. But despite his newer works, his tales of the Old Kingdom are still his best.<br /><br />The Abhorsen Trilogy is a perfect example of dark fantasy, with its grotesque dead zombies that occasionally lurch out to attack the heroes, magical bells, and shadowy beasties that can (sometimes) be restrained. It takes the trappings of high fantasy and lets us see them through a mirror darkly. Not to mention the brilliant concept of the Abhorsen necromancers, who have power over dead and/or magical creatures, and bind them with Charter marks and bells.<br /><br />Virtually all of Nix's characters are likable -- especially the gutsy Sabriel and nervous teenage Sameth -- and the acid-tongued animals and black humor add a wry spin to the fantastical stories. It takes a bit longer to warm up to Lirael, since she spends several chapters in the same-named book feeling sorry for herself, but once she gets moving she's unstoppable -- and very likable.<br /><br />Garth Nix gave high fantasy a dark twist in the Abhorsen Trilogy.

B000ASSDVA|4.0|This is a fantastic movie. One of the most Catholic movies ever seen on the big screen - except for \\"The Passion of the Christ\\". No blasphemies, no bad language, no immodesty, a little bit of unessesary romance, but all in all a fantastic movie. A movie about true Catholic chivalry, knighthood, and heroism.
0062502182|2.0|A short book (at 177 pgs) with large font should've taken me about a week or two to finish....well....this book took me over a month. Why? Simply because I DID NOT WANT TO PICK IT UP. I literally had to force myself to read it. Hearing conversations between my mother and older sister about how \\"this is a classic - a must-read\\" I thought 'why not?' I shouldn't have bothered. Endless droning about \\"listening to your heart\\" and \\"following your heart's path\\" intertwines with messages about \\"sometimes your heart decieves you\\" and \\"follow your destiny\\" made me want to scream 'P**S OFF!!!!' This book has nothing new to offer, no entertainment value and is in no way educational. I told my sister that I didn't like it and found it boring, only to be told that \\"[I] don't get it..\\".

0670033375|2.0|Guns, Germs and Steel was a tough act to follow, and Diamond doesn't deliver with Collapse.  Generally readable and contains some interesting bits, but vastly verbose and about twice as long as it needs to be.  Although he starts out with a balanced, objective approach, by the end he is ensuring invitations to all the cool cocktail parties in Los Angeles by spewing unsustained statistics on global warming with no acknowledgement of any competing views.
B000067UUJ|4.0|Even though I rate this collection at 4 stars, I actually think it could have been much better. The reasons for this I'll return to below. This collection is a bit odd - 2 discs, one consisting of B-sides, and one with a live recording - two nice features for the fans, but unfortunately neither of them complete, which makes them not as valuable for the fans as they could have been. <br /> <br /> <br />Disc 1 - The B-sides <br /> <br />This lot is naturally quite a mixed group, as is only natural. Severa, reviewers have already commented on the natural and unavoidable problem with B-side tracks - being album leftovers, they will often be of lower quality than the album cuts. That's true sometimes, but not always, and this collection contains some really great tracks - as well as some not-so-great tracks. <br /> <br />'Shine Acoustic', , 'Map Of Your Head', 'Shrinking Universe', and 'Recess' are all of a quality that would easily allow them for inclusion on album without falling short - in fact 'Recess' is much better than many of the tracks included on the 'Showbiz' CD, and 'Shine Acoustic' might be in my top 5 of favourite MUSE tracks EVER. The latter is a ballad of amazing beauty, the slow sound of rain falling leads into an almost ethereal song, and Matt Bellamy is doing a vocal that shows him to be way beyond any other vocalist presently in rock music, bar none. In contrast, the almost merry 'Map Of Your Head' is quite irresistable, the jingling - medieval, some have described it as - sound standing quite off the usual MUSE sound - without really sounding out-of-place, because with MUSE you never really know what you get. 'Shrinking Universe' and 'Recess' are honest rockers, the latter with a beautiful piano drive very much remeniscent of 'Sunburn' from 'Showbiz'. <br /> <br />'Nature_1' is another track that deserves mention. It's something as rare as an uptempo acoustic song, with the acoustic guitar as the primary instrument. 'The Gallery' is an instrumental track, not the most interesting they've done, but not bad. On the more weird side, 'Forced In' seems to be drifting along somewhere in outer space, interesting certainly, but very odd. Interesting is also 'Hyper Chondriac Music', a scaled down version of album track 'Hyper Music' - forget all about a rushing pace and mind-blowing noisy guitars - oh, the roaring guitars are there still, but where the album version seemed almost primitive, at least if you didn't listen to the lyrics, this version is anything but primitive - omnious, threatening and nearly grotesque at times, yes, but with grandeur and beauty to follow. Very interesting indeed. <br /> <br />Less fortunate are the results on 'Ashamed' and 'Yes Please' - both are honest rockers, but without very much to offer besides that. Especially 'Yes Please' is way to heavy and primitive to my taste - fans who appreciate the more noisy side of MUSE, however, will probably be delighted in these tracks. <br /> <br />On the bottom-line I will add, that the B-side CD should not be considered as an album, but as a compilation. This one has much to offer the fans, but is not the place for newbies to come. <br /> <br />Most annoying is the fact that the collection is so incomplete. The CD runs for only 40 minutes, so there's some 30 minutes to follow, and loads of B-side tracks have been left off, especially from the Showbiz period. The band might have considered them below standards, but die-hard fans will now have to pay big money to find all the old singles to evaluate for themselves. Also, a double single set was released along with this collection - the Dead Star / In Your World singles, that features the two A-side tracks, and two B-sides, Futurism and the killer cover of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You', that is now legendary among MUSE fans! None of these four tracks are available (in studio versions) besides on these singles, so it seems odd that none of them are on this CD. That's a huge minus for this CD. <br /> <br />Overall rating for CD 1: 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> <br />Disc 2 - Live From Paris <br /> <br />What needs to be said about this recording can be done fairly quickly: MUSE a fabulous live! Matt Bellamy easily proves that his amazing vocal is not only a studio-produced phenomenon. The songs are delivered in a more heavy mich here, which will appeal to some fans and not to others. Certainly I'm not too keen on the very aggressive side of MUSE, but the takes on tracks like 'Citizen Erased', 'Showbiz', 'Megalomania' and 'Muscle Museum' are top rate. Some of the tracks included does not range among my favorites - the nearly absurd 'Micro Cuts' and 'Agitated' among them - but that aside, there's not a spot to put on this recording. <br /> <br />The downside is that this CD only features a selection of the songs recorded on the two nights, october 28 and 29. Apparantly unknown to some fans in the US, a double DVD was released with these CDs; one DVD with a full-length concert recording, and the other with a documentary. Oddly enough, 'Dark Shines' which is on the CD is NOT on the DVD, but what the explanation for this is escapes me. Still, it would seem more natural to release either a complete B-side collection, or a complete live double-CD. As it is now, this double CD collection offers neither fully. <br /> <br />Overall rating for CD 2: 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING BOTH CDs: 7 out of 10. Good but not essential.
B0009QBLA8|4.0|**may contain spoliers** <br /> <br />Eraserhead is a movie like none I have seen. It did remind me somewhat of Pi, however. Eraserhead is another cult classic that has a following. However, I found it at times painful to watch (though possibly because I started coming down with the flu while watching it). I have never seen another David Lynch film, as none of them seemed very interesting to me, and after seeing Eraserhead, I doubt I will in the future. <br /> <br />Though I didn't care for the film, I appreciate it for its originality. The actions of the characters are classic and unforgettable, as is the film. Henry, the main character, is the first of many oddballs we see in the film, as he seems to walk around in a daze, or in his own little world. I think my favorite part was the old lady being maneuvered to toss the salad, and then having a cigarette lit for her. I did find it quite annoying (though I'm sure that was Lynch's purpose) when the baby (if that's what you want to call it) is crying and making noises for quite some time while Henry and Mary are trying to sleep. <br /> <br />I'm not sure what Lynch meant to show in this film, other than its oddness and absurdity. It basically has a no plot, or one that you can follow for any length of time. It has little dialogue, very odd characters that appear and disappear without explanation, and dream sequences that make no sense and go nowhere. <br /> <br />I think David Lynch appeals to the cult audience for his humor, which is evident in Eraserhead. It's twisted and almost sick at times. He makes films that he wants to make, not something the mainstream would praise him for, and I respect him for that. Obviously Eraserhead wasn't intended to be seen by the same type of people that would go see Wizard of Oz or Titanic. It was intended for the underground folks who like things to be edgy and not quite make sense, which he achieved with this film. <br /> <br />\\"A\\"  for originality, but I'd never sit through it again.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Rod seems to have settled into this style of music very nicely. Thanks for the Memory is a very enjoyable addition to the three preceding volumes. The arraingements and background vocals actually exceed the other three volumes. Also, the duets work very well! <br /> <br />Notable favorites are \\"You Send Me\\", \\"I Wish You Love\\", \\"I've Got a Crush on You\\", \\"Let's Fall in Love\\" and the title track \\"Thanks for the Memory\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Nice easy listening.......
B00005JLK1|1.0|Again and again and again we have a movie with the modern horror style that does nothing but bore. There are no creepy moments here. Even the decent cast couldn't save this movie. <br /> <br />The script isn't so bad it's laughable, it's just bad. The twists are predictable, have been done before, and rather boring. Even with a few decent actors, the one-dimensional characters are not ones you care about. <br /> <br />Stay away, rent something better. 1/10. (It was a 3/10 until the last 20 minutes or so).
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Three years after their debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars delivers unto us \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", a spectacular rock album that surprisingly enough sounds nothings like their first (much to the disappointment of fans that expect bands to sound the same on every CD!). Yes, they have embraced a more mainstream rock sound, not too different from bands like The Used, but don't expect them to have lost that captivating ambience that won the hearts of music lovers everywhere. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is a journey through the heart, mind, and soul of 4 guys that know how to touch people through music. It is creatively formed, explores new sounds, and most importantly, is an album they truly believe in.<br /><br />The album opens up with their first single \\"Attack\\" and you couldn't start off with a more gripping song. Packed with invigorating guitar/bass, energetic drums, and vocals so emotional you can feel it, you are sure to listen to the rest of the album all the way through to see what happens next. The whole album flows very nicely from one song to another alternating between hard rock songs like \\"Attack\\" and \\"Battle of One\\" (the first bonus track) to atmospheric anthems like \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", \\"The Kill\\", and \\"The Fantasy\\" to experimental mood music like \\"Was It A Dream\\", \\"The Story\\", and \\"The Hunter\\" (the second bonus track) and there is even an acoustic song, \\"A Modern Myth\\".<br /><br />Not that he needed any improvement but Jared's vocals are definitely at their best - the passion in his voice is phenomenal as he turns each song into a work of art. Shannon, Matt, and Tomo all play with the strength and confidence of a band that has been around forever....they are purely magnetic. Lyrically they are still going strong as well although they seemed to have traded in their celestial references for those that question faith and capture bitter breakups. Sample lyrics include the bitter \\"Your reflection I've erased like a thousand burned out yesterdays, Believe me when I say goodbye forever is for good\\" from Was It a Dream, \\"Your promises, they look like lies, Your honesty, like a back that hides a knife\\" from Attack, the haunting \\"To buy the truth and sell a lie, The last mistake before you die, So don't forget to breathe tonight, Tonight's the last, so say goodbye\\" from A Modern Myth, and the thought provoking \\"Until you give, Until you've used, Until you've lost, Until you lose, Until you see, How could you believe\\" from Saviour.odbye forever is for good\\" from Was It a Dream, \\"Your promises, they look like lies, Your honesty, like a back that hides a knife\\" from Attack, the haunting \\"To buy the truth and sell a lie, The last mistake before you die, So don't forget to breathe tonight, Tonight's the last, so say goodbye\\" from A Modern Myth, and the thought provoking \\"Until you give, Until you've used, Until you've lost, Until you lose, Until you see, How could you believe\\" from Saviour.
B00027JYLC|5.0|Tod Browning's Freaks is one of those movies that you never forget. It is a classic cult film, as its subject matter (circus freaks) could be seen as controversial, and the mainstream audience surely wouldn't find it to be entertaining. This film, like the earlier ones we saw in class, does not shoot for the mainstream, but goes along with a vision the director and the writers saw.<br /><br />Even though this film is considered to be one of the best ever made, the mainstream audience wouldn't accept it, and I love it. I think that it was not accepted at the time because of people's extremely tight morals and religious beliefs. In today's world, where people have come to their senses and have begun to enjoy life, the movie is quite tame (though still disturbing to see the many deformities of nature). I agree that it is one of the best films ever made, or at least that I have seen. It is extremely memorable. For the past week, I haven't been able to get the song out of my head (\\"Gooble gobble, gooble gobble, we accept her, we accept her. Gooble gobble, gooble gobble one of us, one of us.\\")
B000B9EY2U|1.0|In addition to the album, it comes with a dvd. I have to admit I quite liked \\"Clean (bare)\\". The \\"Precious\\" video isn't bad, either. The accompanying 8 minute studio footage is interesting, especially Gahan singing scales to warm up his voice. For these reasons I'm giving it an EXTRA STAR.    DM was a band I loved to death in the 80's and early 90's. I have all the box sets, import 12\\" singles, just about everything a true fan would go out of their way to collect. But the wheels came totally off with Exciter, which was a boring, horrible waste. There's something though about fan loyalty. I am guilty of it. I will buy the latest of most any artist I've followed over the years, always hoping that the old magic exists. Sadly it is nowhere to be found on \\"Playing The Angel\\" (stupid title). In a way, I kind of knew this was going to be another uninspired mess judging by the sleeve art, which looks like a cross between the People Are People 12\\" single and Songs Of Faith And Devotion cover art - totally derivative and self-plagiarizing. Looking at the credits you'll see that for the nth time they've let Anton Corbijn handle the artwork. It's utterly pathetic - can't they find it within them to CHANGE DIRECTION?? Apparently not. The music is nothing but more of the same ham-fisted, overproduced electro-sludge found on the last album. I had a good laugh at the editorial review stating this release has \\"enormous hooks\\" - hah hah, it's just not true, people. I will say that the song, \\"Precious\\" is probably the best track, but really, it sounds like a missing cut from Ultra (which contrary to some opinions IS A GOOD ALBUM). Depeche Mode needs to call it a career and end it all right now. It's over for them. There's nothing inspired here. Nothing which makes your hair stand on end in amazement. The booklet is ridiculous. Martin Gore, failing to pull off a tough-guy pose; the three of them on a junk car in sunglasses looking bored; an overhead shot of them standing single-file ina bicycle lane; Gahan showing the ravages of time; Gahan in a white tee channeling Billy Bob Thornton; a tiered shot of them standing at a motel (a farce); on the back, Gore trying to look what, gangsta? A monochromatic, faux-edgy failure all in all. You put on a track like \\"Shake The Disease\\", a work of genius, and listen to this and you just feel hollow, empty - because that's what this album is. It really is time for them to call it quits; to continue on releasing the same dreck over and over puts their legacy at risk. Believe me, if you never hear this album you're not missing a thing. If you're a completist and have to have it, wait until it hits the cutout / bargain bin because that's exactly where it will end up.
6305736650|5.0|**may contain spoliers** <br /> <br />I think the main draw and popularity of the film Casablanca is its memorable \\"feel.\\" The atmosphere that the film creates in memorable for some reason. Though in times of conflict, there is a certain warmness in Rick's nightclub that draws you in, and has been imitated in films and real life afterwards (there is a replica of Rick's Cafe Americain in Cancun, Mexico). The actors in the film pulled off a film that most others would not be able to. Would Casablanca be the popular cult film that it is today if Ronald Reagan had played Rick? I doubt it. Humphrey Bogart WAS and still is Rick, and no other actor could have played the role better. <br /> <br />Dialogue is another key part of Casablanca. It's quoted quite often (and sometimes misquoted); one who hasn't even seen the film probably knows some of its lines. Some of the lines can almost be seen as \\"downright cheesy,\\" such as \\"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,\\" yet the work in the context of the movie and from the actors (especially Bogart) that deliver them. <br /> <br />Humphrey Bogart is a classic cult film icon because he's charming, suave, astute, very self confident, and believable. Seeing this film for the second time, I could compare him to my own cult hero Bruce Campbell. Both actors show a sort of arrogant confidence, even in the most troubling times. Both actors have cheesy, yet memorable lines that are delivered so dead-pan that one cannot help to think, \\"Wow.\\" Where an actor in a mainstream film would be laughed at for a line such as Bruce Campbell's, \\"Gimme some sugar, baby,\\" or Bogart's, \\"Here's looking at you kid,\\" cult heroes are praised and cheered. Bogart's got a dry sense of humor. He doesn't just blurt out ridiculous things, or fall down doing slapstick. He is sly in his comments, where you aren't sure if you should laugh at the humorous thing he just said. <br /> <br />The mainstream audience might look directly at the love story between Rick and Ilsa. Yet cult fans know that there is much more than that to make a great film. Everything ties the movie together, from the dialogue and actions to the music. Each interacts with one another to put together a single piece that stands on its own. <br /> <br />Casablanca has remained a popular cult film for the above reasons. Though slow at times, it is a memorable film, with memorable characters and dialogue. At times sappy, the film delivers an almost-believable love story, that most actors could not make work. Yet with the actors we have, the film works as a whole, mainly based upon Bogart and Bergman's ability to \\"pull off\\" their parts.

Pride and Prejudice FAR outweighs this one. <br /> <br />First of all, the music in this movie we found to be barely tolerable.Secondly, In my opinion, the foul language could have been left out of this movie. Making it a bit more family friendly. Thirdly, We did watch it till the end, but it was a drudgery. <br /> <br />I have read the book and will say that they perhaps did the best they could at putting this book on screen as it would be a difficult screen play to write. But some liberties were taken in the movie that I didn't like. <br /> <br />Overall, it was a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Pride and Prejudice,Persuasion, and Jane Austen's Emma are excellent movies on which to spend your valuable time and money.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I don't know all Journey songs, but this dvd has most of the good ones. I would have liked 3 or 4 more on it (I'll be allright without you, after the fall, Message of love, ...), but this dvd is perfect for me. Perfect sound, perfect video, and excelent performance of the musicians. I like how those old songs sound now! The extended guitar solo on \\"who's crying now\\" is superb, the rare \\"La Raza Del Sol\\" is my favorite song, I like that kind of music. To make it short: The sound is good, the video is good, and the conception is better: it shows the players and the public when it has to, you can appreciate how a solo is performed, how the drummer \\"drums\\", without that fast-paced-view of most of the videos now. It's my favorite music dvd. It's my musical perspective of it, how a show should be (no screaming, no throwing guitars on the stage, and still you can \\"feel\\" the music and the emotion).
B000AU9UYM|3.0|Is it a bird?         Is it a plane?         No, it's...no not that guy.         It's the one and only Dark Knight, Batman, and this time he's back with a bang. \\"Memento\\" and \\"Insomnia\\" director Christopher Nolan, along with \\"Blade\\" screenwriter David Goyer, has crafted a modern and more realistically grounded Bruce Wayne for the new millennium in his interesting yet flawed \\"Batman Begins.\\"         We start off in some Asian prison where Bruce (a terrific Christian Bale) has ended up from trying to learn the ways of criminals and their ways. He puts a pounding on some bullying prisoners and ends up talking with a mentor named Ducard (Liam Nesson). He tells him of the League of Shadows, a society bent on seeking justice at any cost, swiftly and harshly. He makes Bruce an offer he can't refuse. He tells him he can make himself into an everlasting symbol.         \\"Legend, Mr. Wayne.\\"         He goes through his training-martial arts, sword fights, emotional counseling- and finds his true calling. After a misunderstanding gone wrong with Ducard and the League, Bruce decides to return to his beloved Gotham.         The city is now a nest of crime and corruption, and, according to some, beyond salvation. Bruce feels he can save the metropolis and its citizens. But he'll need some help.  There's his faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine), and his gadget man Lucius (Morgan Freeman). There's his childhood friend/love-interest Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) who works for the D.A. and shares Bruce's/Batman's passion for vengeance and justice. There's also possibly the only honest cop left in town Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman). Most of the paid-off cops see Batman as a nuisance, but Gordon thinks he's \\"just trying to help.\\"         The cast is solid across the board, except for Katie Holmes who just doesn't seem woman enough yet for this role. Bale gives Bruce Wayne flesh-makes him real, genuine, human. We see him make wrong decisions, fail at times, fall or slip while trying toEvil Knievel-it across the skyscrapers, place false hope and trust on others. Cillian Murphy is creepy as Dr. Crane, aka The Scarecrow. Nolan and Goyer fill the script with terrifically refreshing popcorn dialogue that seems simultaneously based in realism. He coats his Gotham City in harsh light and shadows, bringing back the dark tones of Tim Burton's originals.         But Nolan does forget to throw some elements in here to make \\"Begins\\" a classic. He fails to achieve any real sense of excitement or fun into the action, which seems a bit tame for this dark film. He steals a train sequence right out from under Sam Raimi's nose from his astounding \\"Spider-Man 2.\\" if your gonna steal from a classic, at least try to do it justice. The villain here is not supposed to be emphasized as they were in the previous films, but he doesn't feel at all like a match for the bat. And for the most part, \\"Batman\\" is sluggish at times. Now, understandably, it is mostly exposition into the drive and psychological birth of the Dark Knight, but could have had much more brisk pacing.         In the end, Nolan and company have refreshingly bring Batman back into familiar, dark, and gothic territory. He has made an interesting and plausible explanation for the beginnings of the legend, and given his story great acting weight to accompany it. He may have stumbled a bit along the way, but he does a fine enough job to make one genuinely mean this:         It's good to have you back Batman!
B00026WU3M|5.0|Being the Mom of a Deaf kid, when I heard \\"Ring Them Bells\\" from Bob Dylan, I could not believe that there was anyone of his stature in music who cared...about the rejected in society (including many of \\"the normals\\") who don't even know that they are being used and rejected as well. But there was so much more to inspire this woman: \\"Political World\\" and \\"Everything Is Broken\\" could have been written and released right now. It is so incredibly timely: Is that not what we all appreciate today about Dylan's deserved resurgence in music and film? I have often asked over the past few years (especially): WHERE ARE THEY? The artists, musicians, poets, writers who were willing to risk it all (their money or their life) to tell the truth. This is one of Bob Dylan's most eloquent, poignant, passionate and profound releases ever. And if one doesn't get it - try this: Go to a school for the blind or the deaf; or watch poor elderly people stand on line in a pharmacy and try to decide whether they can pay for food or medicine. I hope and pray that more musicians will stand up and do more than glamorous benefit concerts and release music (without the back-up of others) about what is an enormous catastrophe of our American \\"culture\\" which has forgotten entirley - the difference betweeen...right and wrong. In the meantime, I'll just keep ringing those bells.
B0002WS3S2|5.0|I say so because I can't think of any other album in which this quality of musicianship is submitted to the task of such inspired lunacy.   <br /> <br />Steve Hillage rocketing into space on guitar; Pierre Moerlen's frantic jazz pummeling on drums, and magical tuned percussion; Mike Howlett's funky-smooth pursuit of the cosmic groove; and Didier Malherbe's tasty soprano sax and flute musings--a crack band as good as any that EVER played rock music--accompanied by Tim Blake's divinely inspired ambient synthesizer landscapes, Daevid Allen's equally ambient glissando guitar, and the space whispers and instrumental contributions of various women named Yoni.  <br /> <br />It's a once-in-a-millenium musical mix that would be noteworthy in and of itself, but shoots into the stratosphere because of the spiritual depth of Daevid Allen's psychedelic whimsy.  Allen has written many provocative and beautiful songs, but this album is in my opinion his magnum opus, or the whole tamale if you prefer--the climactic story of everyman Zero the Hero \\"going round the circle of births and deaths\\" struggling, and failing, and struggling again to attain/maintain spiritual awakening--it's the story of everybody who ever tried.  Accompanied by the musical equivalent of nirvana.  (Most succinctly demonstrated by \\"A Sprinkling of Clouds\\", which is my favorite instrumental rock piece of all time--a piece of terrifying beauty, like looking into the face of God him/herself...really.) <br /> <br />This release of the album is lovingly, perfectly remastered, and packaged with intriguing drawings and photos of the band that give us a window into the time and place.  It is the definitive CD release, and the best this incredible album has ever sounded.  It is, as space-rock should be, not of this world.        <br /> <br />Many albums of the psychedelic and prog eras came from the stance of presumed enlightenment, with variable musical and lyrical success.  However, \\"You\\" manages to make the leap from merely inspired to INSPIRING--an actual album-length primer for the pursuit of enlightenment.  It's no wonder the band as it was broke up after this album, when Daevid Allen walked away.  There was really nowhere else to go but down, after achieving this dizzying height.   <br /> <br />If I had to pick one obscure album that I wish that others could hear for their own sake, this would be it.  It is, as I said, amazing--and if you have ever wanted to hear how great space-rock could be, you should take a chance on this marvelous disc.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Listen to this. Do what you want out on Highway 61
B000063WDH|4.0|When I went to put the CD in my player I saw the picture of these guys, took another look at the CD to make sure I got the right one, then looked at the picture again.  I shrugged and put the CD in carousel and hit play. <br /> <br />After about thirty seconds I got up, checked the case again, and stopped the CD to make sure it was playing the right one. <br /> <br />Their picture so doesn't match their sound - much less that there's only two of them.  The album is filled with rich, gritty, raw, guitar-riff and scratchy vocal blues. <br /> <br />Some reviewers complained that they are charlatans, or that you're better off buying the original blues masters.  Well, lots of artists can trace their roots to the masters (raise your hand if you think all of Led Zepplin's stuff is original). <br /> <br />My advice is to buy both, the original classics and some of the new ones like this album.  It certainly was quite a nice surprise to hear this disc - like finding a lost classic.
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|This is a video of the first live Met telecast, recorded in 1977.  Therefore, the video image is not up to the standards we're accustomed to seeing today.  There are problems with focus and at times the image is downright blurry.  This is particularly noticeable in scenes with very little light.  <br /> <br />However, it doesn't matter, because Pavarotti and Scotto win you over with their beautiful singing.  I expected a youthful Pavarotti to be outstanding, and he is.  What I didn't expect was to be so moved by Scotto's performance.  I've heard her on many recordings, and admired her singing, but never found her to be particularly engaging.  But after watching her in this production, I can see why she is so highly revered by so many fans.   <br /> <br />The rest of the cast is what you would expect from a Met performance in the late 70's:  highly talented and professional.  The orchestra under Levine's leadership is excellent. The stage production is somewhat lackluster compared to the Zefirelli production that came to the Met later, but as with the video's somewhat fuzzy quality, it just does not matter.  It's all about the voices and the music, and it doesn't get any better than this.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|[...]  Martin Gore did not write all of the songs on the album.  That aside, this item is tagged by the band themselves as \\"pain and suffering at various tempos.\\"  Totally true.  This is truly an album for anyone going through a hard or a depressing time in their life.  The lyrics act as kind of a cheerleader at times saying that you're not alone.  The music is Depeche Mode in full form...inventive and breathtaking with every note played at its perfect moment.  If you get a chance, don't pass it up!
B00000K0T8|5.0|Ghostface's delivery is one that is both abstract, yet contains enough charm to pull the average listener into his world. his lyrics contain in-jokes, references to mythical places, and scattershot memories from his childhood...90% of the time, you have no idea what he's talking about; but you feel it. although this is Ghostface's first solo album, he sounds like a seasoned veteran; handling the curves of RZA's soulful, yet mysteriously minimalistic beats and samples, and allowing his personality to shine through with each verse. there's absolutely no negative thing about this cd...but one point that has always confused me is the cover and graphic design direction. what exactly are Ghostface, Raekwon, and Cappadonna doing on the cover? overseeing the production of the latest Wu-Wear shoe line? and notice the cheezy laboratory test tubes up on the shelf with the dry ice smoke coming out. haha...what??? i mean, that's cool and all, but you have to admit, it's a weird concept for a hip hop album. but then again, it's Ghostface.
0307276902|5.0|I heard Oprah talking about this book on her show and decided to give it a try. I usually read fiction -mysteries and thrillers. I could not put this book down. The writing style is very fluid and the story is compelling. The author shared a very difficult time of his life and the friendships he developed during his rehab. I highly recommend.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Ok, I am a decent Greenday fan who liked 'Dookie'. After hearing the first single from this cd ('American Idiot') i was shocked at how politcal, and strongly liberal it was. Then, as if that wasnt enough, i heard 'Wake Me Up When September Ends', which was coming from the same democratic beliefs. Now that i have listened to most of the cd, i have come to the conclusion that Green Day has sold out and just wants to be yet another group of musicians that opposes our government to try and be rebels. Greenday is just fitting into this new mold of musicians that brainwash their fans into their political stance by always talking about something that they don't have any experience in. Despite the obvious political propeganda, the other tracks like 'Holiday' and 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' aren't stong enough to carry the album. Green Day needs to give up this new political image and go back to their simple punk rock roots that dominated music in 'Dookie'. Don't buy this albumn if you are looking for the old Green Day. Buy some Rage Against the Machine if you are looking for well- thought-out politcal music that actually puts some thought into their lyrics.
B000001ESF|5.0|2112 was my first CD ever.  I bought a CD player, just to play this CD.  I first heard it when I was 14, a long time ago, and it impacted my life.  I know a lot RUSH fans say that, but it's true.  This was when our parents were playing Disco and Saturday Night Fever.<br /><br />2112 was the key to survival for a high school geek girl.  I lived with my headphones on, listening to this.<br /><br />Every track is perfect.  Most CDs you only play a couple of tunes, but 2112 you can play the whole thing, put it on repeat, and let it sooth your beast.<br /><br />It took me a long time to accept it when RUSH started going 'New Wave' (we called it New Wave at the time), but I learned to embrace it.  Their Vapor Trail CD made it back to some of 2112 roots.<br /><br />This CD is timeless, you should have one for your car, one for your bedroom, one for when you have to go to a party.<br /><br />Can you tell how much this CD means to me?  Luv it forever.<br /><br />\\"I stand atop a spiral stair, an oracle ... \\"
B0000013GT|5.0|This album's FLAWLESS. I'll always love Outkast for Southern Playalistic, ATLiens & Aquemini. But I'm thru with them now. Stankonya was a mess. Now ..... {sigh} ...... now I don't know what dem boys doin. They branched out to another fanbase. Thats all good and well, but I CAN'T stand that new stuff. {Speakerbox/Love Below}  It just ain't Outkast. Anyone who listened to them before Stankonya can tell ya.
B0001US62I|5.0|Highly slated when the film was first released it is a fabulous film with a fine cast, all really great performances-how could critics have got it so wrong! Maybe it was bit before it's time?  <br /> <br />Not really a horror-more a thriller really-full of the exotic atmosphere of sultry New Orleans-of hoodoo shops, and baptist churches, snooty southern belle debutants, strange rural rituals in the night, bloody nightmares and plenty of rain. A Detective story about the whereabouts of a pre-war crooner \\"Johnnie Favourite\\" who seemed to live a mysteriously charmed life and then dissapeared of the face of the earth-turns out to have a soul destroying consquences for New York Detective Harold Angel (played by Micky Rourke). Rourke's performance is witty and highly emotionaly charged and the quality of the cast and performances, with Robert DeNiro as \\"Louis Cyphere\\" save it from being too hammy, instead oozing a dark magic. Lisa Bonnet's acting is also excellent in this-it is a real shame she never seemed to do anything after this.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is the best Batman ever! Great entertainment; kept me shrieking all through the movie. <br /> <br />Modern-day graphics are awesome; I can't believe the fantastic graphics in this movie; they just get better and better! <br /> <br />Batman rules!
0140177396|4.0|This story is about two rural farm workers, Lennie and George. They try and acheive their dream of owning their own house on an acre of land. They are close to reaching their goal with the help of Candy, and old swamper on the farm, but Lennie \\"done another bad thing\\".  <br /> <br />I liked this book. It showed the theme of friendship throughout the whole book. It is very realistic. I would recommend this book for young adults. <br /> <br />Ms. Redmon-Period 6
6305252521|4.0|\\"The Truman Show\\" is an entertaining movie with a clever premise and a poignant theme.  Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances as he downplays his usual silliness, and instead gives his character depth and three-dimensionality. <br /> <br />Carrey comes off as funny and loveable while he doesn't try so hard to make us laugh.  Laura Linney is excellent as his TV wife.  But Ed Harris, while a fine actor, seems to be not much more than a caricature of a director rather than a real person. <br /> <br />The mid-section of the film could have been trimmed a bit; scenes where the actors and the director are interviewed break the film's momentum, and the pacing is slow.  The movie sometimes shifts awkwardly from light comedy to intense drama, but it's still very intelligent and compelling to watch.
B00000K0T8|5.0|This was probably the last \\"classic\\" Wu album. The sophomore albums to follow were decent, shining at times, but not quite there. From Enter the Wu-Tang through to this Ironman album: this represents the Wu-Tang era I would like to remember. After this comes Cappadonna, the Bobby Digital albums, U-God's Redemption album, etc, etc... It ended with Ironman as far as I'm concerned. Inspectah Deck, arguably the best lyricist in the Clan, had his shot at a solo album after this, but the album was not given the attention it deserved and the album can be filed in with the other Wu letdown albums. Don't get me wrong, I own all of the Wu albums and I was always a supporter, but the mystique created by Enter the Wu, where they had kids scouring magazines and the internet for information on the legend of the ancient Wu-Tang Clan, those days ended with Ironman. <br /> <br />This album represents Wu-Tang's last true production gem. As someone who listens closely to the beats and production, these tracks are classic, grimey Wu. From the skits to the old movie snippets, it's a great album. Wu members are still making music and Ghostface has definitely become the most accepted member of the Wu in the mainstream (musically, as he is basically the only one you will hear on the airwaves from time to time), but Ghost will never recapture this feeling. This album is a classic and it's the best I've heard from Ghostface.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Loved the show and Movie. Had to buy the DVD. Great effects. Loved the cast and humor. Perfect for Sci-Fi lovers. Must own. Write and/or email NBC/Universal for more Firefly. Go see the Movie. I love Jewel Staite she is so sweat and hot. What a hottie. Perfect for Trek lovers ,SG-1 series, and Battlestar Galatica lovers. The story is the bomb. Buy this, it's worth the investment.
B00014NE62|3.0|I love this storie, the book is very interesting, the movie is good but I think sometimes is a little bit cold. H. Grant looks gourgeous. The ending is quite emotional.-

B0000DBJDM|1.0|I was excited I nearly crapped myself when I heard this was getting a DVD release. I always watched this on video (infact I would always rent it) and loved it. then this movie got released 1n 2004 and I bought it with my birthday. I liked the movie- but HATED THE DVD!!!! Here's why:<br /><br />1. PFLAP was shot in a 4:3 fullscreen format. Here, they put it in \\"Cropped Widescreen\\" and cut off the top and bottom by putting black bars. Rediculous! Instead of a talking head during the interviews, we get a talking nose (lotsa nose-hairs!) more like \\"Crapped Widescreen.\\"<br /><br />2. They put in needless and boring interviews. Really annoying. They last for 10 minutes and get really boring.<br /><br />3. Also, what's really a blasephemy is that they cut out \\"Us and Them\\". Rediculous! It's the best song they ever written. I can't believe it.<br /><br />4. They edited \\"echoes\\" by making Nick Mason's sunglasses dissapear and reappear. How really crappy.<br /><br />Seriously, get the original VHS. It's worth your money. Otherwise rent it. DOn't get this crappy DVD.
B0000024JA|5.0|Everyone waited after hearing the Enter the Wu album. Everyone waited to see what would come next. Never before had hip hop seen a group so filled with talent and promise made up of so many different members. 2 years later, they got Tical.  <br />This album picked up right where Enter the Wu left off, further developing the Wu-Tang style of beats and rhymes. Method Man had established himself as a standout talent on the Enter the Wu album and people knew they would be hearing and seeing a lot more of him. This album delivered the first legitimate solo installment for the Wu. No one who listens to hip hop and who owned this album doesn't have a feeling that is brought back when they hear this album. I was in high school when this album dropped and hearing it brings me back to that time each time I hear it.  <br />The production is amazing: grimey and live. The rhymes are staggering. It's the perfect mixture of style and attitude. <br /> <br />A classic, this album kicked off the solo ventures of the Wu-members that would span the next decade.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Don't let any preconceived ideas about Kanye West or the melodic Rap he favors keep you from listening to this album.  It is one of the best debuts in recent years.  Kanye West appears to have absorbed a wide variety of styles from several different eras.  In part, this is why the CD has a hodgepodge feel to it, and sometimes the transitions from one style to the next don't entirely work.  That said, Kanye West is a sponge for all these styles, and lays them down with singular authority and convincing fidelity. <br /> <br />
B000055Y0X|4.0|\\"Dr. Strangelove?!? What could that possibly be about?\\" Yeah that's what I was thinking when I heard we were watching a movie in English class called Dr. Strangelove.  Little did I know it was going to be the best movie that I had to watch in school so far.  Usually all the movies we watch are educational boring movies that you have to fight to stay awake during.  However, this black and white movie was just a jam packed satire.  In the beginning Ripper sent out planes with nuclear bombs heading to Russia to stop the communists.  They are under a secret plan \\"Plan R\\" which makes it impossible for anyone except Ripper to contact them.  So the president has a meeting in the War room which by the way isn't allowed to have any kind violence in.  They all talk everything over trying to come up with a plan to stop these planes.  The president knew that if the planes hit Russia it would be suicide because they would bomb us right back.  Later on in the movie we find out that Russia has a Dooms Day device and if you blow up Russia PUFF the whole world goes with it.  So this really made everyone nervous, and they knew they were in trouble if they couldn't find a way to stop the planes. <br />      <br />So they do many different things to try and contact the plane and so much chaos goes on while it's happening.  The movie basically targets men at the time since there's only one woman in the whole movie and she's just a playboy bunny.  The men are the biggest satire because its like \\"Oh well my nuclear bombs bigger then yours!\\"  So Strangelove comes up with this bright idea, while fighting with his right hand, saying that if the bomb hits then they can go into a coal mine and live down there.  Of course there would have to be 10 women per man just so they can get the population back to normal. <br /> <br />So I'm not going to spoil the ending or tell you too much about it.  I give it 4 stars which means you should see it, and I think you will enjoy all the satire put into it.
B00005JKG7|4.0|First of all, the movie is great!  I saw it in the theatre when it came out in 1980.  Walking many miles to the movies several times to see Carpenter's 'Halloween' two years prior, 'The Fog' was a definite must see.  Any time it is on TV I never miss chance to see it.  I bought this special edition DVD a year or so ago and view it often.  I love the commentary by Carpenter and Hill throughout the special feature area.   <br />     What I find most interesting his use of character names in his movies and alot of the actors keep showing up in his films.  I am primarily talking about 'Halloween' and 'The Fog.'  The great classic \\"Psycho' even has a connection--Janet Leigh for instance.  In the movie, the character name of the actress who plays her headstrong sister is named \\"Lyla Loomis.\\"  In 'Halloween,' the real name of the great actress who gets stabbed in her dad's car is Nancy Loomis.  Nancy also plays a supporting role in 'The Fog' but instead of being cast as Jamie Lee Curtis' pal like in 'Halloween,' Loomis and Curtis are kept apart until 'The Fog's' ending at the old church--even then, I don't think they say one word directly to each other.  The weather guy in 'The Fog' also played Loomis' father as a cop in 'Halloween.'  The name \\"Tommy Lee Wallace\\" also shows up in both 'Halloween' and 'The Fog.'  I think the actor who played \\"Michael Meyers\\" in 'Halloween' was Wallace and the boy \\"Laurie\\" had to babysit in 'Halloween' was \\"Tommy Wallace.\\"  Tommy Lee Wallace is a good friend of Carpenter's and plays a role in 'The Fog' as well as contributing to the production of it.  Just neat trivia stuff that always fascinated me when I first noticed the connections of Carpenter's films.  Who knows, there may be more!  Buy this flick!
B00005JNQA|2.0|I thought the plot line was OK.  No great, but OK.   I agree with other posters about the logic of the whole thing, but I won't get into it since they've already discussed that.   <br /> <br />I did expect better acting performances from Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman.  They did not seem comfortable in the roles, and I was left wishing the casting director had picked different actors for the roles.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Ok, let me start off by saying that i enjoyed this movie. It was better than King and Arthur and that horrible Alexander. But it isnt even in the same ballpark as Gladiator, which Scott also directed.<br /><br />Kingdom of Heaven had tremendous battle scenes and swordplay and was one of the most beautiful shot movies ive ever seen. The snow scenes and desert scenes were breath taking. The colors and environments stood out and looked wonderful.<br /><br />On, the other hand, i wasnt too pleased with the characters personalities, or lack there of, in this film.<br /><br />None of the characters truly stood out as someone you can 'root for.' Bloom lacked the power of Crowe, Gibson, or even Clive Owen. And like one other reviewer mentioned, Blooms speeches in this movie were laughable and didnt inspire as much as William Wallaces or Theodens from Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />And the pace of this movie, while fast and exciting, didnt give its characters any justice. Bloom leaves his town so fast. Joins his father in 5 minutes. Forgets his dead family quick. Falls in love 5 minutes later. Saladins sister is introduced and killed in 30 seconds total. Everything happens way too quick. Nothing is built up.<br /><br />All in all this was a pretty good movie but it falls right smack in the middle. Not nearly as bad as an Alexander but nowhere near a Gladiator either.
B000AL730O|1.0|I am a huge fan, particularly of the middle/late Beatles and early solo work.  This album is nearly unlistenable.  The instrumentation and vocals are fine!  It's the songs. It's like Macca has jettisoned harmony and melody.  Yeah, I read the reviews where they say anyone slamming this CD is an idiot.  Call me a moron, but this album is pathetic, and Macca would better served taking a nostalgia show on the road.    The Macca taliban will beat on me for this, but it's the truth. <br /> <br />In the last year, Neil Young, Big Star, The Posies, and Brian Wilson all veterans, and some as old as Paul released new CDs, and hit home runs.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|While \\"Batman Begins\\" is probably the best Batman movie I have seen to date (even compared to both of Tim Burtons Masterpieces), I find that many reviews on here are about the movie and not the DVD itself. The movie review is important, yes... but I'm sure people out there would like to know if it is really worth getting the Deluxe edition of the DVD as opposed to the movie alone. <br />If you are as interested in the Batman lineage as I am, the Deluxe edition DVD is sure to satisfy your pallette for now... at least untill the inevetible sequel comes out. Included with the Deluxe edition of this dVD is a comic book that has some rather haunting graphics and a decently chilling story line. I have not yet watched all of the special features of this DVD, but I've sat through some of them. As of yet, there are no deleted scenes that I know of (which I'd like to have seen if there were any) but there are plenty of mini documentaries that discuss various aspects of the film. For anyone who wants to know more about the weapons, new batsuit, or the Tumbler (the wicked new spin on the Bat Mobile) will deffinately get a kick out of these features. The subtle gem of the special features is the \\"Tankman Begins\\" skit performed by Jimmy Fallon as a prequisite to the MTV movie awards. It is pretty hilarious and reminds me of the famous Oscar Skit Billy Crystal put together back in the day. <br />The movie itself is great. It has the origon of Batman drawn out as he matures from playboy millionaire to dual faced superhero. His journey starts with his dread of bats and it is his fear that drives the plot of this film. Fear is actually the main villain... under the guise of Scare Crow and Rahs Al Ghoul (spelling... lol) and it is powerful as it spreads like wildfire and causes a chain of events that would be devastating without Batman to save the day. This Batman is darker and while there is humor, it is more of the dry variety with crisp one liners and a couple of in-your-face moments. I personnaly feel that this movie captures the essence of Batman while its predessecors were to bright or cheerful... funny and abstract... or in the case of Batman and Robin... over the top fun. I am highly interested to see if Robin will be brought into the picture as well as Batgirl... but not in the silly way it transpired with afforementioned film. As for Christian Bale... well... he is now the face of Batman and he is the perfect fit. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, and Katie Holmes all offer decent supporting roles but it is Cillian Murphy (Scare Crow) that outshines them all. He is creepy and villaneous... not at all a nice guy under the disguise of a nice guy. When he goes bad... he gets ugly fast. But, what made this a great batman outing was that the focus on the bad guys was slight... they were merely there to show what extent Batman would go to to protect the innocent. They all accentuated his story and furthered his character development. <br />The sound is great with surround sound... the bat scenes are loud and all over the place which could be a little creepy in a dark room. The picture quality... outstanding. And if youa re a fan... the Deluxe Edition is a must have... if you just liked the movie and are not to interested in all the extra stuff... save yourself 5-9 dollars and buy the regular edition. The movie alone delivers the goods... the Deluxe Edition gives that extra bang for your buck.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman fans have been waiting a long time for a really awesome Batman movie, and well, the wait is finally over. Seven years after the franchise was nearly ruined by Joel Schumacher's attempt to make Batman \\"family friendly\\", ace director Christopher Nolan along with comic-nerd screenwiter David S. Goyer wipe the slate clean and go back to the drawing board. What they've come up with is a brilliant comic book movie. Batman Begins is so good in fact that it even blows aways last year's excellent Spider-Man 2. This is simply an Oscar-worthy movie. It may be a little far-fetched for a superhero movie to be up for Best Picture consideration, but if ever a superhero movie had a chance, Batman Begins is certainly it. Never before has the character seemed so real and believable as he does in this movie, and never before has the audience been so motivated to care about him. Never before have we had an actor of Christian Bale's caliber in the role of Bruce Wayne. With a supporting cast that includes Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, how can you lose? With a brilliant director like Christopher Nolan at the helm, you can't.     The film explores the origins of the character and, for the first time in a Batman movie, actually gives us a plausible reason for a grown man to put on a costume and mask and fight crime. The movie makes the character seem less silly and more believable. For the first time, we get a true portrait of Bruce Wayne: a haunted, bitter man who is angry at the world around him yet wants to make it better at the same time. Batman Begins delves deeper in the psychology of a \\"super hero\\" than any movie of its sort ever has before. Less believable is the second-half plot in which Scarecrow (the excellent Cillian Murphy) wants to spread a fear-inducing drug through Gotham City's water supply. However, the story is so well conceived and executed that you won't mind its far-fetched aspects.     Batman Begins should certainlysolidify Christopher Nolan's status as one of the finest young directors in the business today. He made a seldom seen yet impressive debut (1998's Following), followed by a crime-thriller masterpiece (2001's Memento), then a superb psychological thriller (2002's Insomnia), now he presents a stunning comic book movie to re-energize a dying franchise. I do eagerly await Nolan's next project, nearly as much as I await Quentin Tarantino's and P.T. Anderson's.    Batman Begins was not only probably the best movie of this past summer, it is one of the best movies of the year.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|k, i know a ton of u r gonna click the \\"did this review help u? no button\\" but all I've got to say is GET OFF YO BUTTS AND BUY DIS MOVIE! IT ROX! THE GUY WHO PLAYS BRUCE/BATMAN ROX TOO!  <br />thank u for ur time goodbye
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Depeche Mode is back with a retro sounding album. I've had the chance to hear this album for 2 weeks now and could provide you a detailed review. This album sounds like a cross between Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion, but also contains tracks that would have easily fitted on Black Celebration and Music For the Masses.    01.A Pain That I'm Used To : Probably the 2nd best track on the album after Precious and will be their 2nd single as rumor has it. The track starts out with a groovy bassline. This is an upbeat track with a strange verse in a style we have never heard Gahan sing before, but it sounds real good and the chorus is catchy. 5/5    02.John The Revelator : This one has Gahan singing in louder yelling type voice, which is not in his normal style. The music and singing reminds me of Nitzer Ebb's \\"Ebbhead\\" album and this song could have been easily a song from that album. 4/5    03.Suffer Well : This is one of the best tracks on the album. It's one of the 3 tracks written by Dave and it's the first time Dave is contributing in writing. Up to now Martin Gore was 100% songwriter of all DM songs. This one has a beat and music similar to Behind the Wheel/Route 66 tracks.  CONGRATS DAVE. 5/5    04.The Sinner In Me : A mellow and catchy track with melodic synth layers and has a real cool distorted guitar breakdown in the middle. 5/5    05.Precious : The first single and best track on the album. It has a melodic and catchy beat. The first time I heard this it reminded me of Enjoy The Silence and could have easily been a track from that era.    06.Macrovision : The track starts out with a bassline similar to \\"In your Room\\" and has the same type of singing. However, Martin Gore is singing on this one. The music and production on this is not so great. They could have worked on this a little more...maybe used a catchier beat. 4/5    07.I Want It All : Another track by Dave Gahan. This is my fianc's favorite track of the album. It is a dark track and a very good effort by Dave, but it will take sometime for this one to grow on you. 4/5    08.Nothing's Impossible : WOW! Here we go with a track that could have been on \\"Black Celebration\\" album. Very dark and eerie. This one is also by Dave. Somewhere  in the middle of the song comes this very analogish groovy synth sound. I love this track. 5/5    09.Introspectre : OK, what the hell is this? A short instrumental, with no singing! It's wasting CD space. They could have easily put another track here. The B-side to \\"Precious\\" called \\"Free\\" could have been a great fit here. 1/5    10.Damaged People : Another WOW! Starts out with metallic bell sounds and sang by Martin Gore. This one also reminds me of Black Celebration album. Martin's voice really fits this track well. 5/5    11.Lillian : WOW Again. This one sounds very 80's. It reminds me of the track \\"The Great Commandment\\" by Camouflage, a band that usually sounded like DM, but now DM sounds like them. 5/5    12.The Darkest Star : A dark track again with very cool vintage synth sounds.    Overall this album is a 5 out of 5 and I would rate better than Ultra and Exciter.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|When I heard that Judas Priest had put out a new album, I was a little apprehensive. A lot of modern music is very bland, as nearly everything sounds alike. But, I had faith in Priest, and bought the Dual Disc version of \\"Angel of Retribution,\\" and I couldn't be happier that I did so.  <br /> <br />\\"Angel of Retribution\\" is one of only two albums that vie, in my mind at least, for the title of \\"Best Album of my High School Graduation Year.\\" It's THAT good. I was first turned on to the album about a week ago, when I heard of its release on the Internet. I am a recent Priest convert. (My Ma, actually, is the one who got me hooked on them, (she graduated in '83, so it's no wonder) when we watched the \\"You've got Another thing Comin'\\" video on VH1 Classic. I thought, \\"Those cats are pretty cool,\\" and subsequently purchased the \\"Metal Works\\" anthology.) I was pleased with what I heard on that release, and wondered what Preist would sound like now. The answer to my pondering turned out to be \\"better than ever!\\" <br /> <br />This album stands out from the vast majority of music released in 2005, as it shows a unique originality that is modern, yet definitely old-school. In short, it is a nostalgist's paradise and a modern head-banger's heaven. The overall tone of the album is very dark, in a twisted-Church sort of way. There is a rugged, demonic (but not mind-numbing) quality to most of the tracks, and flaming guitar riffs (welcome in an era of tasteless power chords) conjure images of Hell and destruction. The frequent links to older Priest albums and songs, while slightly annoying, serve to remind old fans of great Priest works of the past and clues in new fans (like me) to old gems.  <br /> <br />I will attempt to review a few of my favorite tracks, for to give prospective buyers an insight into this incredible album. <br /> <br />The first track, appropriately titled, is \\"Judas Rising.\\" It is a hellish and LOUD announcement that \\"Priest is back!\\" The song slowly builds, with an intriguing, mournful, and somewhat Church-like guitar solo. Just as the guitars reach maximum volume, the drums descend upon you like the walls of Hell crashing down, as Halford emits a classic nut-popping shriek. The driving beat and roaring vocals take the listener up with the Betrayer as he rises from the Inferno. Blazing solos against demonic power chords envelop the listener before Halford delves into an even more hellish vocalization of the final refrain, screaming Judas' arrival as all Hell breaks loose before the sharp ending. Incredible. <br /> <br />\\"Revolution,\\" although not my favorite track, is destined to be a classic Metal-rally song. \\"If you think it's over/better think again/there'll be no compromise...\\" There is an inherent toughness throughout that makes this song kick some serious butt. It has a classic Metal-structure, but with the harshness and vitality of more modern Metal. This should be a prize for fans of old metal and younger audiences alike. <br /> <br />My favorite song on this CD is that which many people complain about, \\"Loch Ness.\\" The song is 13 minutes and 29 seconds long. In the hands of any other modern artist, such a long piece would be an incredible, tasteless drag. Not so with Priest. The song begins darkly, quietly, and somewhat mournfully, as a fuzzed-out guitar wails a powerfully-hollow solo to the slower, sadder strumming of another guitar. Then, a louder, even more fuzzed-out guitar takes hold, in an excellent (slightly-stoner) solo, joined by a second guitar, and shortly both guitars plunge into a doom-y, foreboding sequence of fuzzy power chords. Halford makes his entrance with especially menacing vocals, as he describes the dark, mist-covered Scottish Loch and the mysterious creature \\"with eyes set coals of fire\\" that makes it its lair.  He pleads, power raging in his voice, to the lake to \\"protect monstrosity\\" and to \\"confess your terror of the deep.\\" The music then breaks into hellish high-pitched guitar-solo pyrotechnics set atop dark power chords and heavy drums, and then breaks into quiet, unnervingly dark tranquility as Halford, in an entrancing style, croons soothingly, in near-lullaby fashion, \\"your secret lies safe with me.\\" Then, quite suddenly, the music returns to its loud, infernal roar as Halford sings the final refrain and chorus, leaving the guitars to finish it off (they do so brilliantly). It is, all in all, a truly intriguing piece, and a real gem of creative songwriting.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is an excellent comeback album by the greatest Metal band ever. Every song on the album is high-quality, and are refreshingly unique in an era of musical conformity. Buy it.
B000AL730O|5.0|All of my life I have been listening to the music of Paul McCartney is one fashion or another, as a girl I was infatuated with the Beatles, I continued to enjoy his music with Wings as an adult and now how wonderful it is to still be listening.  Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is no different, it's really good. It's not just the CD that is good though, it's after all these years Paul McCartney still has that presence about him, 'in this ever changing world in witch we live in', it's nice to know some things have remained the same!
B000002H33|5.0|If you like Metallica then you will like this album. If you have heard one of the songs off this album and like it then you will like this album. All in all this a great metal record. It is very consistant and should please you most of the way through (if not all the way through). An essential for any fan of Metallica or newcomer. One of the greatest thrash metal albums ever.
0140166157|5.0|This book is quite a bit different from Ms. Allingham's usual Campion books.  As excellent as those are, this book is really something extraordinary.  Allingham's characterization is faultless and her portrayal of a sociopathic serial killer is chilling in its intimate portrayal of him.  We don't see very much of Campion in this book, but her other characters steal the show.  There is the truly wonderful Polly and Annabelle and young Richard are wonderful, but her depiction of Gerry is remarkable.  This book is a gripping read and an Allingham tour de force.
0143034901|5.0|I won't write a plot summary as many other reviewers have already done so; I will only say that this is one of the best books I've read in awhile and is definitely now on my list of favorites.<br /><br />It's not a light read - the plot is intricate and detailed, and there are many characters and details to follow, but it is absolutely worth it.  The writing, a little long in some areas, hits the mark in so many others - it's poignant, touching and so interesting!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|So Im a pretty big fan of DM but the last couple of years I kinda got away from listening to them. Mainly because they didnt have anything new out and because a lot of good stuff like the Killers, The Bravery, and Franz Ferdinand came out.   But I was pretty pumped for the new DM cd and i wasnt let down. I actually was afraid that they were moving away from their synth roots since the last album was so mellow and let electronic.  But this album opens up in your face.  Its rockin and dancin at the same time.  It reminds me a lot of Violator but even back before Black Celebration when they were all synths all the time.  I dont know why some people are giving this a bad review when this is clearly such an awesome production.  It wont be leaving my cd player anytime soon.  This is actually the first DM album i liked straight up in the first listen.  All the others take a few listens and then they become your favorite.  This just caught me from the beginning.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Dave, Marty, David, and Nick come together and give us one the greatest thrash metal albums of all time. If you are looking for technical thrash metal then this is a great place to look. The musicianship on this album is outstanding. Awesome riffs and amazing solos along with a killer rhythm section. ONLY PROBLEMS: Dave's voice is not for everyone (if you are not familiar with it then listen to some song samples to see if you're okay with it). Also: this album is remixed and hardcore fans of the original release may be dissapointed, especially with some of the vocals being re-recorded. ANYWAY... great thrash metal album, highly recomended.
0596007124|5.0|People who give this book bad reviews owing to its presentation style are missing the point.  People have different ways of learning.  Some can leap to the abstract concepts fairly easily. Others (usually the majority) often need an example to help \\"get it\\" and from there can move to the abstract concept and apply it to other environments. <br /> <br />This book is for those who learn by example.  Even better, it's fun -- a dose of much-needed humor on an otherwise dry subject. <br /> <br />This certainly isn't the definitive book on patterns. It's tone is certainly introductory.  But if you *are* a beginning programmer or a more experienced one who is relatively new to OO or have just never needed/used patterns before it's a great way to start without worrying about falling asleep as you read.
B000055Y0X|5.0|All throughout last week, my english class viewed \\"Dr. Strangelove\\".  A satire, the movie mocks the idea of war for peace. It begins at the height of the Cold War.  A general of the armed forces decides that the idea of communism must be stopped.  He orders nuclear bombers into the air, and in doing so, a nuclear attack has begun without the president's consent. A new protocol has been enlisted and in time of nuclear war, a base commander is permitted to launch a nuclear attack in the event that the chain of command is disrupted because of nuclear attack.  The new protocol is now the cause of the end of the world.   <br /> Now, a heated debate begins on what should be done.  Someone suggests that if they struck the Russians hard enough, they could win a nuclear war with \\"acceptable loss\\", of fifteen to twenty million. This is where the movies humor begins to become apparent. The general, who engaged the nuclear war, believes the communists are attempting to poison American soldiers with fluoride water. As the movie progresses we see how insane the general is, yet his insanity and far-fetched thoughts add to the humor of the movie. He is the only man who obtains the \\"code\\" that could call off the nuclear attacks entirely; however, before it was too late, the general takes his own life in fear of being a prisoner of war. As American bombers begin to reach their targets, one plane is  hit badly and the plane is severely damaged.  As the president and his cabinet work furiously to work on deciphering the code, the American bombers work to repair the plane damage and re-route to a new target.  The code is then deciphered and the attack is called off and slowly the American bombers begin to retreat, however as for the plane that was hit, the radio transmissions with the code are not received due to the damage, so they continue toward their target.  Heroic? Well, not exactly, you see the communists have planted a \\"doomsday\\" device in with will detonate upon any explosion.When the plane drops its bomb, the device is engaged and the world ends.  Sad, yet humorous at the same time to think that even the best of intentions can lead to the most disastrous of results.   <br />
B000002JB3|2.0|This album just plain SUCKED.  I encourage change and experimenting but this album just showed that even phil collins can run out of material.  For the first time it appeared as though phil was trying and even struggling to create.  I have mixed emotions of anything he has done since but seriously.  In that album the musicianship is phenomenal and there are so many people playing on it.  Also, his drum patterns and acoustics were extraordinary.  Dance into the light was dufficult to listen to.  When I bought it in 1996 I had goosebumps the entire drive home waiting to listen to it.  I remembering not even making it to the 4th song.  It was hard to listen to.  The drum patterns were weak.  There was no real strong moments except for otta know by now which felt pretty rocky and convincing like most phil collins related material does.  I was just disppointed.  Daryl Steurmer's presence was different as well.  Look, I guess I am so used to phil doing such high quality stuff that when this came out I was just let down.  Oh well, noone can stay on top forever.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Anthony Minghella directs this tale based on the best-selling book about wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) making the long, treacherous journey to his home in Cold Mountain, N.C. Along the way, he thinks of his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman), who has fought for sanity and her father's farm's survival while Inman has been gone, even with a brave young drifter named Ruby (Renee Zellweger, in an Oscar-winning performance) there to lend a hand.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Martin Scorsese gets an A+ for this excellent portrait of Bob Dylan's early years. The film also presents a unique historical view of the '40s, '50s and '60s music scene.<br /><br />Paramount Pictures gets an F for force feeding previews. Many DVDs allow you to press Menu and bypass the previews. Not this one! So every time you want to watch the film, you have to waste time with the previews first. I find this captive audience tactic a despicable marketing ploy.
0792839749|5.0|Great Movie. My wife is Chinese. She likes watching reruns of \\"Diagnosis Murder\\" with Dick Van Dyke. She thinks Dr. Slone dances well and is funny. It ocurred to me that she never saw Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, or the Dick Van Dyke show, so she had no idea why Dr. Slone was so witty and good with the ol' bamboo. I bought Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins and she loved his character, but was in disbelief when I revealed that Bert the chimey sweep was her beloved Dr. Slone. But now she understands more of Van Dyke's background and loves him even more. She said that he is a better entertainer than most anybody she sees today. It is too bad that Disney has to create remakes of Herby instead of making modern true classics.
B00013RC8O|5.0|The 70's was full of great chase movies. From Smokey and the Bandit to Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry. This gem \\"Vanishing Point\\" is ranked high on the list of nonstop action/chase movies of all time. Yeah, the plots were simple. Get your merchandise from point A to point B in a very short time. But, what seperates these great movies of the past compared to today is.....They didn't have to rely on computer imagery or animated scenes. Nor did they  have to rely on the \\"F\\" word in just about every line to get the message across. I mean just think if they were to cut out every \\"F\\" word in lets say, Beverly Hills Cop. The movie would probably last about 45 minutes. And if you took out Eddie's irritating laugh it would be reduced to maybe 35 minutes. But, back to Vanishing Point. Bottom line a great movie to take a leisurely spin through the country side. And for you die hard fans of the early 70's softrock group Bread. A very young David Gates appears in The Faith Healer Scene (with Delaney & Bonnie & Friends) playing the piano. Though David was not credited for his role in the movie. So why not plan a Saturday night double feature or a movie marathon weekend with \\"VANISHING POINT\\", \\"DIRTY MARY CRAZY\\" and maybe SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT\\".
0553582461|2.0|As a whole, the series was disappointing.  While Fitz grew up, the other characters in the book had little wisdom or intelligence.  The central krutz of this book is Fitz finally figuring something out that Chade or Prince Dutifull or the Queen or anybody else could have figured out 500 pages before Fitz figured it out.    And then Fitz had to use his \\"magic\\", which DID NOT WORK.      Some of the more questionable points in particular:  Why take a some-what heroic (while flawed) character, and make him a nurse-made to a sea-sick mentally challenged person for half the book?    Maybe so he doesn't do some logical thinking and doing something to end the boot 400 pages early?    Chade and Fits couldn't figure out that the plan to 1) kill the dragon, 2) kidnap the narchassis family into forcing her to force the prince into killing the dragon came from the pale lady?  They've become idiots, all in a sudden?    Fitz couldn't figure out that the person he 1) loves 2) known almost all his life 3) his best friend, 4) who can see the future, can be trusted!  If he says, the future is better if you don't kill the dragon you 1) DON'T KILL THE DRAGON!    This is so elementary it's almost insane.    Ok, moving to the fool.  I know the future is better if the dragon is saved.  I have a lot of money.  What do I do?  Wait for the pale lady to make a play for killing him?  The fool has gone stupid too?    Ok, moving to the pale lady.  I want the dragon dead.  But I know that trying to kill him will potentially let him free.  Hmm, maybe I shouldn't force a foreign prince to come and \\"kill him\\" and thereby potentially let him go free?  Dumb.    The book should have been written probably from the viewpoint of his daughter.      On the other hand, going back and seeing FitzChivalry again was fun, and seeing him happy was great.  I'm sad it took so long, and I'd quite understand how getting your painful memories back can make you more tolerant of risk.  But I'm glad Hobbs gave Fitz some happy times.
B0006PV5US|5.0|It's clear that RCA must be the champion of re-release and re-packaging, but then again this famous Ravel/Debussy disc from the mid-fities in the Living Stereo series remains in a class of its own. The winning combination of Charles Munch and the Boston Symphony musicians set standards of orchestral virtuosity, sense of atmosphere (one can really smell the fragrances of the night in Debussy's \\"Images\\") and full-blooded excitement that have hardly ever been equalled, let alone surpassed. And very few have proven more authoritative and eloquent than Charles Munch in the French repertory.    Available now in convincingly enhanced SACD sound quality (which is indeed an improvement of its previous CD-guises in clarity, warmth and pure sonic impact), this is one of the greatest discs of Ravel and Debussy of all time.
B000AM4PBS|2.0|For the people that are complaining that its not fair for WB to produce this box set of all 10 seasons at a reduced price. I'm sorry but how did you not see this happen. I purposefully didn't the seasons individually so that i could buy the box set when it inevitably came out. On the other hand, they really should have done some kind of deal where for ever season you send them back, they get like 10$ off the price of this box set, that would have been fair, but we live in a capitalistic society so, get over it
B000002JPA|5.0|That's right, go home and just die. Dream Theater beat you over the head with the pwnage stick. Find a more beautiful and well-put together album and ill give you money. This is coming from a huge fan of metalcore and hardcore too, these guys are the best. i met petrucci at a guitar signing, hes really awesome and i saw his show and they win times 398673948. Just stop and buy this album before i stalk you to make you buy it.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|I won roundtrip airfare, hotel, and concert tickets for Cream in NYC (Madison Square Garden) on Oct. 22, and I can't wait.  I also won this DVD and CD and it's awesome.  Never was a Cream fan before, because I simply didn't follow them, but they have some good stuff.  It's neat seeing Clapton with his old band.  Hey, I'm only 35!
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Why all the hype?  Are we that desperate for anything decent that we rush to give a mediocre album 5 stars?  DM is on a downward spiral, and even they don't know it.  This album lacks: inspiration, melody, passion, and good song writing.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few pretty good songs, but even these songs would be the worst songs on a good DM album.  Bands that need to quit-DM, the Cure, Erasure; bands that are getting better-Echo & the Bunnymen, New Order, Camouflage.  As another enlightened reviewer put it: if you are in to dreary sounds, distorted synths, and no melodies, then by all means buy this album.
B00005JO0J|4.0|'Serenity' is great fun and a triumph in that it re-assembled the original cast. My only doubt is, which member of the crew is the hairdresser? Whoever it is works very hard grooming the others.
B00005JNQA|5.0|Yes, if you look hard enough, you can find a few errors in the plot of this movie.  Big deal!  The overall plot is completely believable, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman have excellent chemistry on film, and the movie has just the right mix of action and interesting dialogue.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays the mysterious interpreter Silvia Broome, a woman with a very mysterious past, though throughout the movie the viewer is never sure just how mysterious.  Kidman is perfect for this part.  She seems just as mysterious in real life, so this role did not require a whole lot of character change.  Still, she makes her character come to life on the big screen.<br /><br />Sean Penn plays a Secret Service agent assigned to investigate (and later on, protect) Kidman's character.  He doesn't deserve an Academy Award or anything, but he pulls off the job quite well.  Sean Penn is just a fun actor to watch.  I don't think he copies anyone else's style.  He is unique in his approach to his craft.<br /><br />I don't want to giveaway the plot of this film, so I will just say that there are a few turns and twist that keep the viewer guessing.  The rest of the cast, the directing, and the filming are all topnotch and enjoyable.<br /><br />As I said with the title, this movie is solid entertainment.<br /><br />See ya next review.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|I can only imagine what the meeting at Warner Bros. looked like when they first devised plans to do this atrocious (and not to mention blasphemous) remake of the classic 1970s children's film Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. <br /> <br />Studio Head:  Remakes are the thing now, gentlemen.  They're the only things making money at the box office nowadays.  We should make one.  Any suggestions? <br /> <br />Flunky #1:  How about Porky's? <br /> <br />Studio Head:  Nah, too raunchy.  R-rated comedies rarely do well. <br /> <br />Flunky #2:  What about Bambi? <br /> <br />Studio Head:  Too nice and cheery.  A family flick needs to have some bite to it in order to work in these times.  Just look at The Incredibles and Shrek.  Besides, the Mouse owns the rights. (looks at Flunky #3, who is eating a candy bar)  what do you think we should do, Jennings? <br /> <br />Flunky #3:  Mmmm... this candy bar sure is tasty!  The milk chocolate is divine! <br /> <br />Studio Head:  Wait a second... chocolate... how about we remake Willy Wonka?  It's not too cheery and there are lots of colorful sets.  Audiences will be mesmerized. <br /> <br />Flunky #1:  Do you really think a musical would work in this day and age? <br /> <br />Studio Head:  Nah, but who cares?  We can eighty-six the musical numbers. <br /> <br />Flunky #2:  But wouldn't purists complain? <br /> <br />Studio Head:  Okay, okay, we can leave one or two in, but none of that crap from the original.  We'll write some of our own stuff.  (turns to Pickles the Monkey)  Are you up to writing a song or two for the Wonka remake, Pickles? <br /> <br />Pickles:  EEEEK!  EEEEEEEK! <br /> <br />Flunky #3:  How about the star?  Surely, we can't hire Gene Wilder.  He's too old. <br /> <br />Studio Head:  You're right, Jennings.  He's also not young or pleasing to the eye.  Box office death. <br /> <br />Flunky #1:  I know of someone perfect!  (pulls out cell phone and dials)  Hello, Tom Green?  We were wondering if you'd like toplay Willy Wonka in our new-what?  You think doing a remake is stupid?  (hangs up phone) <br /> <br />Studio Head:  We don't need him anyway.  Say, give me that rolodex, Jennings.  It's time we pick our players the old-fashioned way-in a game of rolodex roulette! <br /> <br />Flunky #3:  Ah, yes, isn't this how you cast War of the Worlds?  (hands his boss the rolodex) <br /> <br />Studio Head:  (opens rolodex, spins it and points blindly)  Okay, Tim Burton.  I guess he can direct the film... and... (repeats his previous auctions) Johnny Depp!  Warthington, get on the phone to Mr. Depp! <br /> <br />Flunky #1:  (dials his cell phone)  Hello, Johnny?  It's Warner Bros.  We're wondering if you'd like to star in our new remake of Willy Wonka?  What?  You'd love to!  Excellent!  But what?  You want to make a few changes? <br /> <br />Studio Head:  That's fine, that's fine.  He's Johnny Depp, for crying out loud.  (looks up at his 21 Jump Street poster)  I LOVE HIM SO! <br /> <br />Flunky #1:  No songs?  Well, we already nixed the songs, John.  No likable characters?  Okay, that's fine, too.  It works for all of Reese Witherspoon's movies.  And you want your Wonka to be creepy, pasty-faced and almost pedophilic, like Michael Jackson? <br /> <br />Studio Head:  A ripped from the headlines Wonka, just like the Law & Order franchise on television!  My God, the man is a GENIUS!  (slams his fist on the table)  It's a deal!  The world will LOVE the new Wonka! <br /> <br />The rest, as they say, ladies and gentlemen, is history.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay is going to have a hard time besting this masterpiece.  Even songs I didn't care for at first listening are now some of my favorites.  Some bands have it and some bands just get lucky...Coldplay has it in spades.  A true masterpiece!
0385513755|4.0|In all fairness the book itself was an ok read but the size of the book was difficult. I lugged this oversized book all over the place; to work, to appointments and everywhere else I like to have a book handy. I loved the photos and illustrations. I can't imagine reading this book without them. I just wish the book was more compatible for carrying around. It's more the size of a small coffee-table model than simply a big book. Overall, I enjoyed reading it. The codes and cryptics which blended with actual historical places were quite fascinating. Some, I felt, were a bit over the top but they all made for interesting speculations. Nice book but just too darn hard to carry around.
0316777722|5.0|David Sedaris' book is very entertaining - particularly if you find people in general and Americans in particular, amusing. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed his sections about his brother and sister. While I agree the section that is about when he was addicted to crytal meth is a bit tedious for those of us who can't relate (The 12 steps to being an artist), I must say reviewer \\"Nemisis\\" didn't seem to comprehend Sedaris' point that he is NOT an artist and only thought he was because he was on drugs. I also think reviewer \\"Nemisis\\" must be homophobe with no sense of humor!  <br />
B000B2YQX4|4.0|The picture of the cover makes absolute sense if you think about it.. Because angels have wings, so he is made of a collective of feathers to play an angel. Ever since Exciter and Dave Gahan's solo album Paper Monsters, the music has played soundtrack for anyone in a personal rut. Their music no longer became about collecting fans, as much as it is about collecting faith. They have been around the longest of years, and anything they do works from just guitars and standard band works to adding a bit of electronica to better emphasize their feelings in music. Not many people do that anymore for fear of messing it all up. Their music turned from new wave to a more Indie feel of dark Industrial. This album continues the comeback brilliance they showed with Exciter. <br /> <br />With \\"The Pain That I'm Used To\\", the music starts off with static and squeak before hitting hard with electronic dark melody while \\"John The Revelator\\" takes the popular Gospel, hooks the wires up and creates matter. \\"Who's that showing? John The Revelator!\\" Only anyone would know if the song is used to mock or to show that John had pain to show and went through a lot to help us repent. In \\"Suffer Well\\", Dave Gahan shows his view of salvation as one that shouldn't be led by those who are more fools than an angel. \\"An angel led me when he was blind/I said \\"Take me back, I changed my mind.\\" backing down the same way in \\"The Sinner In Me\\", by admitting, \\"I'll never be a saint.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Precious\\" opens up with a electronic disco beat about the man who fell from grace, after suffering for all the others have done to him. \\"We always tried to share all the intensive care and now look what we have put you through\\". This is the standout on the album, basically because the song is for the suffering lovers who tried. \\"Lillian\\" becomes a story of the woman who, after moments, have tore her innocence to pieces and destroyed whom she loved. Dave Gahan's voice in this song is so haunting that it may bethe theme to anyone's nightmare, especially with the name. Dave Gahan sings, \\"Oh Lillian, what have you done? You stripped my heart, tore it apart in the name of fun\\". <br /> <br />Depeche Mode's take on using music to better prove situations, even pushing with the addition of choirs, has taken them a long way, and still will for ages to come. Basically this album is a must-have for fans and must-have for those who love the mixture of electronica and rock. Mostly, because Depeche Mode can do anything they want and make it sound like a pitch black labyrinth that you have to get out of on your own. In fact, those who buy it are the ones who claim they are ready for a challenging race of life with themselves with Playing the Angel as the theme song. The one enjoying the album is the one who has strategies on how to beat the labyrinth they built on their own. <br /> <br />Rating: 7.75/10
B00007GZR5|1.0|This movie paints a depressing picture of the afterlife.  It's very new age-ish.  It's theme is that Heaven or Hell is created in our own minds and circumstances.  I feel that the story itself is so unbelievable that it's hard to really \\"buy\\" what's going on.  For example, Robin Williams is in Heaven.  Okay, but, he is unhappy!  That right there is a problem.  For those that make it to Heaven, there are no more tears, no more sadness.  Here it's no different than here on Earth.  And, Hell is depicted as people under water, lost in a sea of turmoil, loneliness.  Hell is about the unquenchable fire tormenting people day and night!!!  Now, Robin Williams' ability to leave Heaven and go to Hell was so dumb.  I mean, if that was the case, people from Hell could traverse to Heaven.  So, if this is the case why do these two places exist?  To me this movie doesn't depict a comforting representation of Heaven or a terrible, horrifying Hell.  The story, is simple.  Robin goes to Heaven, his wife goes to Hell because of a suicide and he makes his way to Hell to get her and bring her back.  In the end, she ends up with him in Heaven with there son and a dog and a representation of their house and they both live, well, happily ever-after.  I am very, very skeptical of movies that depict places like Heaven and Hell.  There are no movies that have faithfully come close.  Is it visually stunning?  It's okay, the graphics and such are okay, nothing \\"breathtaking\\".  Is it believable?  Certainly not.  Would I recommend it?  Definitely not.  It will only confuse you.  If you want a story about how a man's love for his wife makes him got to the extremes, find another movie.  If you want a movie that represents Heaven and Hell, stay away from this movie because it'll only confuse and depress you.  If you want to learn about Heaven and Hell, read the Bible.  This is the best source to learn about it.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie is right where it belongs... in the bargain bin. Marvel seems to be 50/50 on their movies. Half are good. Half are disappointments. The Hulk was surely a disappointment. Here's the trouble; I'm tired of seeing some director's interpretation of a comic book character. These characters are already established icons. I want to see a movie true to the comics. I do not want to see some artsy-fartsy Hollywood genius's version of the character. The Hulk has been around for 40 years. Don't these creative prima donnas know there is a good reason for a comic character being so popular for so long? Ang Lee had entirely no sense of the Hulk. You could tell he probably never even heard of the character until he got this movie deal. For one instance in The Hulk, they have the Hulk being attacked by two gamma irradiated dogs. How hard would it have been to replace the gamma dogs with the Abomination? My advice to Marvel is to let directors who know their characters make their movies.
B000002B30|3.0|This Greatest Hits collection is just that, his Greatest Hits! As a long time fan of his, I personally consider his first 5 albums his greatest hits. All of them seem to be masterpieces with each song holding its own value. This collection, however, omits some major hits from this time period and adds four tracks as filler at the end of the disc. Secret Garden being one of the singles released from this album. They are good but seem lost against the rest of these classics. Missing in action are I'm On Fire, Prove. It All Night, I'm Going Down, Fade Away, Cover Me and his early classics Blinded By The. Light, Spirit. In. The Night, Sandy, Rosalita and Tenth Avenue Freeze Out.<br /><br />Still not sure why he would not let Bette Midler record Pink Cadillac, claiming at the time that it was not a song meant to be sung by a woman. He \\"changed his tune\\" a few years later by allowing Natalie Cole to do a disco version of the song and score a top 10 hit!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Overall I liked the movie, The Grapes of Wrath, better then the book because it went at a faster pace and the dialogue was enhanced by the personalities that the actors gave too the characters.  <br />However there were certain scenes cut from the movie that were crucial to the book that I would have liked to see. One example would be the Joad's dog getting run over, which symbolized the family getting run down and coming apart. Also some scenes from the book are rearranged in the movie. For example, Tom gets his face cut by a police officer and then goes into hiding. The book then ends abruptly. Whereas in the movie, Tom gets his face cut but stays with the family for another 45 minutes. In the book, there was a metaphor before every scene that foreshadowed what would happen in the events to come; those scenes are cut from the movie. For example, in the book there is a turtle who gets flipped up on his back but then gets back up. This symbolizes a country that gets knocked down but then gets back up. I would have liked to have seen more symbolism in the movie in order to provide more meaning. I liked the end of the book better because the author concluded it well by tying up all ends. In the movie, they leave you wondering. <br />The differences between the movie and the book are numerous but doesn't change the plot in a great way. In my opinion, the movie is better because it provided a descriptive version of the story.
B00007GZQI|4.0|Is this movie perfect? Far from it, but this is part of its charm. None of the reviews I have read thus far have included the priceless, utterly hillarious scene enacted by the superb Sir Laurence Harvey performing the \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy from Hamlet in front of a stodgy uppercrust theater audience while performing a STRIPTEASE! The final shot of his codpiece being tossed out into the audience is worth the price of the movie alone.  <br />
B000B2YQX4|4.0|It's good - there's no real denying it, but whatever you do, don't read the lyrics before hearing them set to music.  That's Martin Gore's problem - if you buy CDs on the strength of lyrics, you'd probably only have two or three DM albums on your shelf. <br /> <br />This album seems to follow on from some of the heavier sounds from 'Exciter', opening with the claxon sound from 'The Dead Of Night'.  The tempo and rhythm doesn't always seems to fit the lyrics, and you end up with Dave Gahan trying to fit the words around a structure that doesn't suit it ('A Pain That I'm Used To).  John The Revelator seems to be the track that everyone is raving about, and it's a good stomping track let down by its atrocious and lazy rhyming.  The Sinner In Me is probably the strongest contender for a second single, but could probably benefit from some Flood-style remixing to make it just that bit more danceable.   Everything else is of pretty good, and will probably grow on me as their other albums did. <br /> <br />Reading back on that, I've probably been a too hard on the boys, and I've given it 4 stars because on the whole it works.  I've listened to it maybe a dozen times since I got it 24 hours ago, which says it all.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|This new stuff is missing something in the songwriting, I think.  The sounds are definitely cool.  If there is growth evident, it is in the performances.  What is sad, is that their talent of general quality control seems to have dropped the ball.  They could have waited even more time and got some material I know they're capable of together.  I'm not sure when I want to reach for Depeche that I will put this in.  It kind of sounds like it's full of outtakes from the Violator period.  There are a few really great tracks, but they have never put out an album that was just half good.  The band themselves even seem unsure in interviews, if the songs are actually getting better.  I can't honestly say they are.  Still, it is nice to have new output from them, regardless.  Like the Beatles 'Mystery Tour', this can still be embraced and enjoyed.  It is not a bad album, fortunately.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|I got this album after my sister played a couple of mp3s for me.  As an architecture student, I often sit in front of my computer or drafting table for 10 or more hours at a time, and many times I just put one album on repeat and listen to it about 20 times.  I did this with \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" this weekend, and I am listening to it right now.   <br /> <br />The word that I think sums the album up most accurately is: \\"compelling.\\"  After listening to the album over and over and over again, I have come to respect the achievement of this band and this album in a way that I respect the work of very few bands; the members of Panic! manage to absorb and, in a critical way, digest and re-produce many varied musical precedents into a strangely fresh form.   <br /> <br />I am stunned that nobody in these reviews has mentioned the influence of the band Refused, specifically the album \\"The Shape of Punk to Come.\\"  The radio static fading in and out between techno fills, blending between songs, was done to amazing effect almost exactly seven years ago on \\"The Shape of Punk to Come,\\" and in one sense one could say that Panic!'s album falls short of the promise of such an obvious influence, as Refused set the bar for all progressive punk/rock/rhythm/techno fusion forever, yet due to their obviously varied pool of influences, comparing Panic! and Refused is a bit like comparing apples and oranges.  I think what Panic! has borrowed from Refused (complete variety through a mix of analog and digital musical techniques with an unrelenting, rhythmic energy) is completely effective in establishing a foundation upon which Panic! has succeeded in crafting an alarmingly listenable and compelling album. <br /> <br />2. In the first song, \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide is Press Coverage,\\" the plea:  \\"Sit tight, I'm going to need you to keep time, come on just snap snap snap your fingers for me,\\" is delivered over a simple acoustic guitar line and a thin electronic snare beat, which leads quickly into crunchy electronic guitar with live drums.  This plea is a perfect one to open this album with, compelling the listening to follow closely, as just within this single song the music bounces back and forth between pop and darker punk influences, techno, and folk with an effortless grace. <br /> <br />3. The thing that stands out most starkly to me in the second song, \\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines,\\" is how the melody (\\"make us it, make us hit, make us scene...\\") of the chorus sounds exactly like a Coheed and Cambria melody, but I haven't been able to find the exact song it's reminding me of.  Overall, I find the choice of topic and the content of the lyrics to expose a certain degree of immaturity, but I suppose that's to be expected from such a young band. <br /> <br />4. I love the opening synth/guitar (?) line of \\"Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks.\\"  It reminds me of NES games from fifteen years ago.  Then the heavy vocals filter... so Cher! <br /> <br />5. The imagery and tone of \\"Camisado\\" strongly recalls Brand New's \\"The Quiet Things that No One Ever Knows\\"; a young and masculine lyricist waxing poetic about the violence native to living fast and loud and the inevitable pause the spectre of death presents to such a mind.  Overall not as effective as Brand New's song in dealing with the subject matter, but, again a bit like comparing apples and oranges, as \\"The Quiet Things\\" is a classic, driving Brand New anthem and \\"Camisado\\" is more nuanced and painted with techno florishes.  It's most successful moment is during the filtered drum breakdown beginning at 2:02, its abrupt transistion into its quiet, contemplative repetition and drumroll back into the chorus.  But, again, the formula was also successful in \\"The Quiet Things,\\" and several other Brand New (and Blink 182, for that matter) songs, with a contemplative bridge building up to an anthemic final chorus.  Panic! could learn a bit about vocal harmony from Brand New. <br /> <br />6&7. \\"It's Time to Dance\\" and \\"Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\\", though very different songs, make sort of a mini rock opera in the middle of the album for me, as the lyricist manages to arrange two different songs, one with estrogen and the other with testosterone as subjects of their respective choruses, next to one another in order on the album.  Excellent, haha... <br /> <br />8. Ah, the Refused influence finally makes itself indisputable.  However, radio static and techno aside, I must say that the piano solo on \\"Intermission\\" is quite remarkable for a pop/punk/whatever band to have pulled off; most of the bands that I have known personally or have listened to a good deal tend to stay quite close to the guitar & bass & drum arrangement, and for a baroque-ish waltz to spring up in the middle of this album is pretty rad.  Not to mention the artful accellerando and sloppy notes towards the end which are eventually overpowered by a THX-ish digital flourish of noise... so interesting, if unpleasant to listen to.  It's things like this, the creation a tension within the listener, a fretfulness caused between enjoying the intellectual operation within the song and the actual cacaphony of the sounds being made, in Panic!'s music that brings it closer to art than most bands would even understand. <br /> <br />9. \\"But It's Better When We Do\\"... What is this??  A ska song?  WTF?  More diversity, craziness... <br /> <br />10-13.  \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" is a great song, as are the last three songs, as varied in their influences and as skillfully written as the rest of the tracks.  I find the cello on \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\" particularly welcome, reprising the most recognizable melody from \\"The Sound Of Music\\" (????!!!!) to cap off the most diverse pop punk album ever written. <br /> <br /> <br />And in conclusion, I feel I need to emphasize part of the last point:  in terms of overallcontent, tone and production, this ultimately comes across as a pop punk album, and this is the reason I have given it 4 stars and not 5.  I feel that, while there is an obvious maturity to the skills that were necessary to create something that fuses so many musical influences so seamlessly, there is also a nagging immaturity to the overall feel of the album, a sort of ansty teenager feeling that I feel is only holding this talented band back from truly breaking new ground, musically.  As Brand New really managed to mature as a band with Deja Entendu, I eagerly look foward to Panic!'s next album, when the product will hopefully fulfill the promise made so obvious with this exceptional debut.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|At first this may sound like a pop record, but listen to the melodies and lyrics, this is one great album.  Don't listen to it once, put it in your CD player in your car and play it again and again.  Each song is gem.  This is so rare these days.  The songs lift you up and make you feel good about life.
B000AARKOO|3.0|This movie wasn't nearly as dreadful as the reviews indicated.  I found it very watchable.  (On the other hand, the last historical epic I watched was Oliver Stone's \\"Alexander\\" and after that, anything would have seemed good.)<br /><br />It was well paced, in fact it even seemed a bit rushed during the last half.  Granted, much of the dialog is ridiculous, and the characters say anachronistic things that no one from that time and place would ever have said.  But then isn't that true of almost every movie?<br /><br />The basic outline of the story is true to history.  Saladin really did beseige Jerusalem, after wiping out a very badly led crusader army.  And the city really was defended by a commoner named Balion.  (The movie makes him the bastard son of a noble, but that part is made up.)  This is a true episode of little-known history, surrounded by alot of untrue details added pursuant to artistic license for dramatic reasons.  But again, how does that make it different from standard Hollywood fare going back to the silent era?<br /><br />Some have criticized this as being anti-Christian and pro-Muslim, but I didn't see it that way.  Under any objective judgment, the crusades were not the high point of Christian civilization.  There is one place in the film where a priest is saying \\"God doesn't count it a sin to kill an infidel,\\" or words to that effect.  No reasonably alert and informed viewer could fail to notice that that is exactly what the Islamic jihadists are saying today, so how can that not be viewed as a dig, in equal measure, against medieval Christians and contemporary Jihadist muslims?
0452282152|5.0|This can be a very interesting yet easy story to connect to. Tracy Chevalier uses many images and emotions to portray the feelings different characters have with one another. The author conveys such vivid images of Griet's love for her master that you can almost feel yourself falling in love with him as well. She is torn between her forbidden love of her master and her love for Peter, the butcher. The author describes and uses small climaxes of emotion throughout the book which is realistic and keep you interested in wanting more. The authors portrayal of Griet as a 16 year old teenage is girl is perfect, she correctly follows the path that teenage girls go through with falling in love for the first time and dealing with new events and new emotions in life. The author successfully describes the class system of the time. How there were masters and servants, and how servants felt they were so beneath the upper class. It shows how times are different today, because Greit and Vermeer has such a strong love of each other but couldn't act upon it because of class differences. The author also goes into extreme detail when describing art, from the mixing of colors to the detail of the canvas.  A must read for anyone at the high school level or above <br />
1592400876|5.0|I'm no grammarian, I can barely remember what a comma is, but this book is very funny.  If you like British humor, this will strike your funny bone.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|UNEARTH - The Oncoming Storm  -  Honestly this album is nothing new BUT, it kicks serious ass.  This is one of my favorite Albums of 2004.  This is \\"the\\" Metalcore album.  Musicianship on this CD is incredible.  The 7-String Guitar work is some of finest... The Bass is well done, the Drum work is great, and the Vocals are perfect for this style of music.  As stated before this album really isn't anything \\"New\\" but there is Talent, Creative song writing, And some great songs... It may not quite be Dillinger's - Miss Machine or Mastodon's - Leviathan but it stands tall amongst many other albums in 2004.  Also in a scene over credited to Killswitch Engage I'd gladly hand the Metalcore throne of 2004 to Unearth's - Oncoming Storm.  Favorite Songs: Failure, Black Hearts Now Reign, Endless  4.25 - STARS      IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:  \\"Was this review helpful?\\"
0553579908|5.0|George Martin's book are some of the best I've read so far, with complicated plots, wonderful characters, twists, and no right side to root for. But be forwarned- these books are not for people who expect happy endings. The books are cruel, but outstanding.
B0006399FS|2.0|Like the other 1900 people here, i'm a huge fan going way back to the -nevermind. The last itme we waited four years for an album we got Achtung Baby. The time before that we got The Unforgettable Fire. Both stellar albums. This time though, I think this is my least favorite (after POP) lyric album but one of the best U2 albums musically. <br />Love and Peace certainly gets one's attention. The Edge's guitar  <br />and Adams heavy bass make it radically different from everything else on the album. Now that I think about it the guitar is the  <br />only truly interesting part of the entire album. The melodies drone into one another and well, with unconnected imagery and a lack of poetic center it just throws me off. Not their best work,but not the worst either.
B00000163G|5.0|When Suge signed Pac to Death Row, that was the best signing he made since he signed Dre and Snoop. This is true westcoast hip hop in its entirety. 2 disc of real hip hop from a hip hop legend. When Pac dropped this album, people were running to the stores to get it from all over the world. Too many great songs on this album to choose favorites. I say the whole entire album is my favorite.
0142001104|5.0|This book was recommended to me by an old friend.  Without a doubt it is one of the best books I have read on dealing with others.  Perhaps one of my favorite things he writes is about RULE 6- \\"Don't Take Yourself So Seriously.\\"  How often do we fall into the trap of thinking that what we have to say is THE most important statement of the day?  We need to take the time to LISTEN to others.  Zander has a way of exposing those things that prevent us from relating well with those around us.  I guarantee you will have your life changed by this book!  I certainly changed my paradigms.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|First rule: If a review includes words like \\"insipid\\" and \\"poignant\\" or if it berates a show for being bombastic, well, I suggest ignoring the review. Typically people who write like that are trying hard to be \\"critics\\" (the quotes are important) and in doing so, they generally lose all sense of connection with both what is good and what is talented, falling back on what their (often over explained) \\"musical history\\" has \\"taught\\" them. If people don't by now know that both opera and broadway shows thrive on \\"bombastic\\" and otherwise powerful music, well, then they're fools. <br /> <br />That said, Wicked is a good show with a few great moments. It is definitely worth listening to and, more importantly, worth seeing in person. I have not seen it on Broadway, but I did see the national tour and was quite happy with the show, it being my favorite since the run of Cameron Mackintosh shows from the 80s. <br /> <br />The bad: Wicked is very, very weak in regards to ensemble music. Typically, if you come out from a show humming an overall theme from the show (not a solo song), then its a sign that the music was, overall, decent. While Wicked has a few identifiable theme melodies, not one of them seemed to stick throughout the show or stick with me afterwords. The opener, No One Mourns the Wicked, is like a bad version of \\"At the End of the Day\\" from Les Miserables, in both music and staging. The lyrics are clear on the CD, but are utterly garbled and overpowered by the pit on stage. When Glinda enters the song, it improves immensely, but the overall song doesn't have any great qualities or stand out moments beyond that. Also, songs like One Short Day and March of the Witch Hunters come across as lacking. Again, they are mediocre at best. <br /> <br />Also bad, and I am going to get lambasted for this: Idena Manzell. She is an absolutely fabulous singer. Her voice is clean, her range strong and her power is extraordinary. The problem is she's just a bit too perfect. I saw Stephanie Blocke on stage and her voice is a bit darker and a bit harsher and, while just as talented a singer, her voice fits the part just a bit better. Idena is great, certainly, and she does not detract from the show at all, however, both my girlfriend and I listened to her and though \\"wow, beautiful voice, she's a lot more suited to Glinda.\\" In fact, in few points of their duets, its difficult to tell her voice from Kristen Chenowith's. <br /> <br />The Wizard's songs are also rather mediocre. It is like Schwartz was trying to throw his songs back to the early musicals like Oklahoma or South Pacific and, frankly, they just don't fit in with the rest of the show. Further, they don't really convey anything about the character. He's clearly meant to come across as a silly old fool who has no real clear ability to conceive of right and wrong, but he just felt like \\"village idiot.\\" I think the part would have done much better had he been cast as either a cynical conniver or a rather comical fool). <br /> <br />Finally, there are a couple weak songs that are primarily solos (with some ensemble). \\"Dancing Through Life,\\" well, is jarring. It is a complete switch in the style of both the show and music when Fiyero appears and the song feels totally out of place. Further, its just not a great song. Its a rather flighty monotone and while flighty was what the character was meant to be, it doesn't really feel like it is going anywhere. This could be my taste, but I really just didn't like the song. <br /> <br />Also, I have to say I liked \\"No Good Deed\\" but I didn't love it. At that point, Elphaba is trying to transform herself into something darker and, though she appears to fail at that and remains good at heart, the song comes across as more of a sad lament (appropriate at the time, perhaps, but sorta anti-climaxes a great build up). I think the song should be a bit faster, a bit more venomous. Not bad, but I think could be improved. Again, could be personal taste. <br /> <br />The Good:  <br />Ok, here's a bone: Idena Manzell. Yes, I said I would like her better in a different role, but she is outstanding and there's no point in denying it. Fabulous singer, and so is Kristen Chenowith. <br /> <br />There are a few songs that stand out and make both the show and the CD worth the money: <br /> <br />Popular: This song is cute and funny on the CD and Kristen is great at it. Her version is flawless. However, this song is easily twice as good staged. While some people who haven't seen the show might just find the song downright goofy, the staging of it is fantastic, so long as the performer for Galinda is able to convey the silly bounciness of the character. Very fun. <br /> <br />What is this Feeling?: An ok song on the CD, well done by Idena and Kristen though at some points they meld a little too well. Staged this song is great. Like Popular, it depends a lot on the chemistry of the performers. <br /> <br />For Good: A great ending. It doesn't have quite the power of some of Broadway's biggest songs, but it remains touching. <br /> <br />Defying Gravity: The power song of the entire show, a \\"critic\\" would find this song to be \\"overwrought,\\" \\"talentless,\\" \\"bombastic,\\" and \\"playing to the popular taste of the unwashed masses.\\" Yeah, ignore those idiots. The song is fantastic. Well written, damn well performed and very, very powerful. On stage it is significantly better as well. It is probably the most moving first act end I've seen or heard since \\"One Day More.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, Wicked has its highs and lows. Thankfully, its lows aren't \\"that bad\\" and the highs are good enough to make it very much worth the trouble and money. If you consider yourself an \\"artiste\\" or a \\"critic\\" then skip it, as you'll be too busy trying hard to critique it to enjoy it. If you simply like good, solid Broadway shows, then I recommend this highly.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Rhino has done it again. From the production to the performances, to the interviews, this DVD is a must for all \\"Creamaholics\\" such as myself. 37 years after their last performance in the same venue, The Cream have proven \\"that they still got it\\". The magic and the fire are still there but improved, due to their maturity and experience. Undoubtedly this is their peak, as Jack Bruce tells E.C. during one of the introductions. It's a thing of beauty to see these three prodigies play as a team and enjoy it so much; you can just see they're just having a ball! All three are playing better than ever and even Jack and Ginger are getting along better than they ever did in the old days. Add to that the fact that in this show they get to play songs that they never played live before such as Pressed Rat & Warthog and Badge. If, by any chance, you're missing any of the upcoming Madison Square Garden gigs, I venture to say that this is a good substitute. Take it from a Cream freak and connoiseur......
0804102988|5.0|Mr. Rutherfurd wrote and outstanding story of 5 fictional families who come to live on the Salisbury Plain in the two cities known as Old and New Sarum. The 5 families come at different times to from 7000 BC as hunter and gathers to the Celts, Saxon and finally the Normans. The family members continue to pass on traits and there fortunes are made or broke and they move up or down in status throughout the history. The events of the book revolve a lot around the possible history of Stonehenge and Salisbury Cathedral. This is a great way to learn history and enjoy a story all in the same. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in British History.
B000B9EY2U|5.0|I bought this album this morning, but have been listening to it through various means for the last two weeks. After the letdown that was \\"Exciter\\" this album is a stunning return to form for Depeche Mode. Tracks like \\"Precious\\" (the first single), \\"John the Revelator,\\" \\"Lillian,\\" \\"Nothing's Impossible,\\" and \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" rank up with some of the best of their oeuvre.<br /><br />The group sounds really into their work, and dedicated to putting out an album that shows what they can do. And it's apparent in each track; the only real misstep is \\"Macrovision.\\" Personally I wish they had put the B-side \\"Free\\" on in its place, but that's a minor detail; \\"Macrovision\\" is by no means unlistenable.<br /><br />All in all, this is an album I would readily recommend to anyone interested in Depeche Mode. Well worth the money!
B000B5XOSO|4.0|Too many people don't like this movie because it is extremely dark and creepy. But thats exactly what Batman is. The cast is excellent especially Danny Devito's portrayal of the Penguin. He deserves as much recognition as Jack Nicholson for his work as the Joker. The plot and dialogue are excellent with enough action to keep you going. If you even liked the original \\"Batman\\", than you're in for another treat with this second installment. If you are more a fan of 1997's \\"Batman & Robin\\" than maybe this is not for you. its only too bad we had to wait 13 years for a another Batman movie of this or better caliber.
0385486804|2.0|Krakauer's Into The Wild, is about Christopher McCandless' fatal journey into the Alaskan wilderness and about the motives that drove him there.  Krakauer writes in his usual journalist meets novelist style that at times can be extremely engaging but is not without its flaws.    Krakauer is at his best when talking about the specific facts of Chris' journey and when he gives background stories about other famous frontier men gone AWOL.  Just like Into Thin Air and The Banner Of Heaven, Krakauer is most engaging when giving us the details and first hand knowledge of the respective topic.  Three excerpts struck me as being this books saving grace.  First is when J.K. finally gets the part he traces McCandless path across the Alaskan wilderness and the investigative details that led Krakauer to his own conclusions.  Second, is the chapter when J.K. goes into fascinating detail about other fatal living excursions in the Alaskan wilderness.  Finally, the chapter where J.K. goes into detail about his own attempt to climb a specific Alaskan ice cliff is not to be missed.    The problem with the rest of the book is in fact Krakauer's subject.  I didn't find Chris that interesting nor did I particular feel any affection for him.  We read about his childhood and family life, his different stops in various U.S. locales, and stories from others who ran into him a long the way.  At times I found myself bored and frustrated at McCandless for his inconsiderate actions toward his family.    We've all had moments when the hustle bustle of everyday life makes us want to simplify our lives to the extreme.  I think this is the supposed \\"hook\\" of this book....that we can relate to Chris in some way or another.  I like camping, nature and \\"simplicity\\" but shunning society for years at a time is more extreme then most of us can relate to and so on that specific note...Into The Wild misses the mark.    Bottom Line:  Like other Krakauer stories, I believe this book started as magazine article and it probably should of stayed that way.  Worth reading specific excerpts while spending some time in a bookstore....the chapters are labeled conveniently.
0783226837|1.0|Why anyone would give this movie 5 stars is beyond me.  It stinks to high heaven....acting, story and all.
B000A7DVY0|1.0|I am a huge Lebowski fan and watch the movie at least once every 2 weeks.  So, as you can imagine, I've been awaiting the release of this boxed set ever since it was announced.  Although I have not watched the new edition on the DVD yet, I'm sure that anything added to the old DVD is a plus and the new DVD is worth buying, but DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE SET!!  Things included in the set: <br />- The new DVD that can be bought for 13.99 on Amazon.com <br />- 4 coasters.  These are the cheap cardboard coasters that are fine in bars all over the country that will probaly last for about 5 uses. <br />- A thin, cheap towel that can't in any way be used for bowling.  I was st least expecting that if I couldn't use the towel for bowling or the gym, that it would be a nice keepsake...not the case here.  It's cheap and about as thin as tissue paper. <br />- postcard-sized pictures.  What the heck am i going to do with these?!?!?!?!?! <br /> <br />Overall, not worth the 35 bucks, even for die hard Achievers like myself out there.
B00000I5Y6|3.0|KANSAS-THE BEST OF KANSAS: Bombastic art rockers KANSAS, whose trademark sound incorporated ROBBIE STEINHARDT's violin much as JETHRO TULL utilized IAN ANDERSON's flute, will always be most closely identified by their big trio of radio classics...the tricky time signature stompers CARRY ON WAYWARD SON and POINT OF KNOW RETURN, plus the mellow seventies prom staple DUST IN THE WIND. Naturally, BEST OF rounds up those timeless chestnuts but wrongly ignores KANSAS' worthy second-tier &#34;hits&#34; such as PORTRAIT (HE KNEW), PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH WIND and WHAT'S ON MY MIND. Even worse, those underrated gems are passed over in favor of some fairly slick schtick warbled by STEVE WALSH fill-in vocalist JOHN ELEFANTE, namely the decent ringer PLAY THE GAME TONIGHT and the insipid FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE (on which they sound uncomfortably close to STYX). Three &#34;bonus&#34; tracks tacked onto this remastered roundup add nothing but time to the disc. The wise consumer would be better off checking out vital albums like LEFTOVERTURE and POINT OF KNOW RETURN...that's where the REAL best of Kansas, in all their overwrought glory, lies.<br /><br />RATING: THREE FIDDLES
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Well, this is my first Amazon review ever...so what better way to kick things off than by reviewing an album from my favorite band, Dream Theater? <br /> <br />Now, let's look at ToT, shall we? Looking at the tracklist upon buying this album, I noted that almost every song was at least 7 minutes long. Now, this wasn't my first DT experience, so I knew already that they could pull off longer songs pretty damn well (if, admittedly, not all the time). So undaunted by this, I popped the CD in the player. <br /> <br />Let's see how the tracks panned out, shall we? <br /> <br />As I Am - The first thing I enjoyed about this song is how it faded in where Six Degrees ended. However, I'm not sure I liked the way it suddenly changed from an epic ending to a dark, menacing riff. It seemed to contrast a little too much, ok...so not the best first impression ever. But I continued to listen to the slow, churning intro riff, noticing that this sound was definately heavier than some of their earlier material. Then, the main riff suddenly came in and basically kicked me hard in the face. Off it went, thundering into the vocals, and I was immediately buzzing! This song, even now gets me excited listening to it, and why not? It's fast pace is enough to get anyone pumped. It nicely went from fast and heavy verses into clean segues, perfectly setting up for slower paced, but equally as heavy choruses. The solo was unlike what was to come. It wasn't too long or show-off, and I didn't get tired of it, a quality I wish would have remained. All in all, an above average performance. <br /> <br />This Dying Soul - The continuation of The Glass Prison, and Mike Portnoy's pummeling drums at the very beginning didn't even give me a moment to rest and reflect on As I Am. After a few bars, it went into a nice little solo over some cute, if slightly unimaginitive riffs... still, I suppose they didn't take the spotlight off the solo too much. A couple of guitar and keyboard solos and suddenly the song mellowed right out, making way for James LaBrie's soft, tentative vocals. A catchy choral line \\"I wanna feel your body breaking...\\" would leave me singing this in the bath, at college, wherever, randomly. All good so far, but then, OH NO! What on Earth is LaBrie doing? A rather shaky rap section, only just saved by a stellar couple of singing lines afterwards, then after another chorus and a pretty piano section, off it went into a repeated segue-riff from TGP, brilliant in it's sheer simplicity. After this, however, the song deteriorated a little for me. Everything past the segue riff just didn't work for me. The vocals seemed rushed, the riffs were uninspired, and the solos (both Rudess and Petrucci) were just too fast and melody-lacking. I found myself yearning for the song to finish halfway through the solo. Oh well, it was going well until then. <br /> <br />Endless Sacrifice - Ooh, something slower. This was a pleasant surprise. I'm a man who enjoys his ballads, and this one promised not to disappoint. A pretty little guitar riff underneath a gentle keyboard solo. Both Portnoy and Myung blended nicely into the background, allowing the focus to go to the other members. LaBrie entered as Rudess took the background, and then gave off, so far, his best vocal performance on the album. Soft, emotional vocals, really well done considering he hadn't penned the song. Into a crunchy, fist pounding chorus which, while ever so slightly nu-metally, you can't help but love, just for the sheer anthemy feel of it. Second verse introduced some exquisite piano work from Rudess, the first time he properly shines on the album. After the song went on like that for a while, the pace picked up, leading into a faster, heavier section. Nice use of keyboard voices from Rudess, and off it went into a cute, humerous keyboard break. Solo time, and again, they seemed to drag it out a little too long, and by the time it went back into what should have been a good, heavy closing section,I was once again yearning for the end. <br /> <br />Honor Thy Father - Mike Portnoy introduced this song in a much similar way to This Dying Soul, with pounding drums, not relenting for a second. At first listen, this song seemed kind of bland and uninspired...and was my least favourite on the album. However, after numerous spins, you learn to accept that it's meant to portray feelings of anger and hate, and no other style would do. Some sections felt nu-metally, while others just felt heavy for heavy's sake...whereas at first, James LaBrie seemed to just be mimicing the bassline. However, again, after a few spins, I grew to appreciate the song for what it was. Now it's actually one of my favourites off the album, a number that one can fully appreciate at full volume, with some catchy singalong moments (\\"On and on and on and on it goes!\\"). One thing I liked was that after three songs of hectic soloing, this song doesn't really have a \\"real\\" solo section, at least not from Petrucci. This shows one of Rudess' finer moments, ranging from the building up synths in the spoken section, and the techno keyboard solo leading to the final sung section. <br /> <br />Vacant - My favourite track on the album. Wow. After four songs of blistering prog-metal, DT take a moment to sit back and chill. Petrucci and Portnoy, who had, until now, dominated the best of ToT, finally let go of their instruments and allowed Rudess and Myung to show their capabilities. The shortest song, just clocking in under 3 minutes is beautiful. If I were the type to cry at songs, I think this one would be a definate tear-jerker. LaBrie giving off his most convincing performance on the album, reached out to me with his soothing, nearly falsetto vocals. The Cello was a welcome addition, and added a decidedly melancholy feel to the song. Wonderful <br /> <br />Stream Of Consciousness - Ahh, something for those who've thusfar been disappointed with the album's new direction. This one, I thought would take awhile to grow on me, but it actually gripped me straight away. Carrying perfectly from Vacant, the song started with a fast, clean picked section, which slowly climbed it's way into a heavy, proggy instrumental. I'm not going to comment much on this, as I'm sure you've already heard raves about it, but to say that my favourite, often overlooked section, was the bass dominated section, with the groovy guitar effects over the top. Myung's moment of glory, supported by Petrucci nicely. <br /> <br />In The Name of God - Wow, the epic to end all ToT epics. Starting, again, where Stream left off, a clean, haunting, melancholy guitar riff started things off, suddenly kick starting into an eastern influenced guitar/synth duet. Mike Portnoy and John Myung seemed subdued up until now, keeping things mid-tempo. This headed off into one of my all time favourite Petrucci guitar riffs. Very metal, very catchy, very inspiring. James LaBrie came in with some very menacing vocals, as all the instruments carried the song nicely. An emotional chorus with subtle grand pianos, I was pleased to hear James doing his own vocal harmonies here (or so I think). A heavy, driving section followed this, another chorus, and then into the darkest section of the song, the bass and drum section. (Btw, hear the random sounding drums here? Can you guess why Mikey P. did that? ;)) The vocals are very soft and menacing, as the instruments all subtly add to the bass, building up the feeling of menace and emotion. And boom, into the final tediously long solo section, and boy this one was going to be long. However, this time, it wasn't so bad, as there were some cute scales going on between Rudess and Petrucci, behind a very funky bass line and some rather cool pianos. This all served to lead up to a climax, the main riff, and a pinched harmonic that send so many shivers through me, it was unbelievable. Into a slow-paced, emotional section, chorus and the grand conclusion. The whole thing was topped off with the grandest of grand piano outros, leaving with a note that left feelings of panic and the sense that it's far from over. The final key played, and silence. <br /> <br />Wow, what an album. Chock full of chilling emotion, heavy, pounding metal, and exciting music. One quandry I had with the album, was the fact that they seemed to extend the solos far too long in places...and it seems to me they were doing it solely to make the songs longer, trying a little too hard to be epic, maybe? That aside, a top notch album from the 'Theater boys.
B000023X9W|4.0|yeah that Dusty Springfield Again, that one grooves, don't it? <br />I am a die-hard, an On the Beach-er and all that, but I like a bit of mellowed out Neil as much as the next guy. I love it.
B000055Y0X|4.0|This has to be one of the more unusual movies i have seen. From the cowboy riding the bomb to Dr. strangelove who is a very..how can i say this... unique person. It starts within the walls of an american air base. General Ripper,the leading officer at the base, commands all his planes to bomb the \\"Commies\\". Well guess what, Mr. President didn't order the general to do that. Ripper blocks off all comunications with the outside and sets his hole base against anyone who comes within 200 yards of the base. The movie goes on with the president discussing things with other officials in the war room.In the end the plans get called back except one and they set off their boom. Once it explodes the doomsday device is set off and it is the end of the world. This movie is set back after the cold war. So for me that was way long ago. It was hard to relize some of the satire in it. This move is funny, but is a differnt funny as compared to your cartoons or comic book. This is full of satire.  <br />  I don't recomend this movie to anyone less than 16 years old. Although it doesn't have many bad things it, it just isn't for someone looking for a quick laugh. You have to really pay attention to the movie in order to appreciate it. all in all it wasn't that bad
B00004Y87O|4.0|Ah, even today, that line has true meaning! <br /> <br />Twenty five years ago, when ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK was being filmed, New York City had been a crime-ridden sleaze pit for the past 15 years, so it seemed totally conceivable to me that by the end of the century, the entire island could become nothing more than a maximum secutiry prison for hardened criminals. <br /> <br />John Carpenter had that vision, with a dark and chilling movie that stills rings true today in a post 9/11 city.  Speaking of which, there is an early scene of Air Force One headed straight for a downtown building with the twin towers just to the left as a prison guard looks up with astonishment.  It was chilling back in 1981.  Now it's just plain frightening to watch. <br /> <br />As for the sequel, ESCAPE FROM L.A., I couldn't even get through the first half hour.  I mean, how frightening can a world be that takes place on the beach under the sunshine???
B000A6T1JU|5.0|This is like gang action on broadway...it's awesome.<br />i never saw the original..so this was my first time watching it and i don't have anything to judge it against.<br />I thought this was really a gang (see...violence, guns, blood) movie...it isn't. this is theater =)<br />definitely not what i expected..and most men i talk to do not like it...i do live in the sticks, though =)<br />the warriors is excellent..the interviews with the actors in the directors cut is really cool to watch.
B000683VI4|5.0|I believe that even men would enjoy this love story.  Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling have great on-screen chemistry.  Even though I have never read the book, this movie makes you believe that true love can stand the test of time.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|It seems everybody agrees that the new album is an improvement on Exciter. It is but I still got problems with it.      Depeche Mode still hasn't thrown away their guitars,they still think of themselves as a rock band.But for hardcore fans this is not the case.THe 2 best songs here are MICROVISION and DAMAGED PEOPLE. Fans who loved BLACK CELEBRATION will love these  2 songs. OTher highlights include PRECIOUS,DARKEST STAR and I WANT IT ALL. On these songs there irritating guitar sound are kept to a minimum.    As for the rest, they just sound like a second rate NINE INCH NAILS. They probably will never throw away their guitars,they probably think it will be some kind of a regression musically,which is a pity.    Come on DEPECHE MODE go back to your roots and give us more In the vein of SOME GREAT REWARD,BLACK CELEBRATION and  VIOLATOR.  FOR us true fans these rock songs just doesn't cut it!!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|If you are a DM fan and were disappointed by Exciter then Playing the Angel is something you will want to buy TODAY! Its an awesome return to the dark music and cool electronic sounds that DM is famous for. My favorite DM album is Violator and that is the album I compare this new one to. Its got great lyrics and great beats to keep you into the music for hours. <br />My favorite songs on PTA so far are Precious, Suffer Well, Nothings Impossible, A Pain That I'm Use To, John the Revelator and Sinner In Me. I like about 9 out of the 12 tracks on there which is pretty impressive. A few of the others will grow on me but this is really one DM album you should own. DM IS BACK!
B00097DX3U|4.0|Love them or hate them, this album sounds like they are finally a cohesive unit other than a supergroup. I could go on forever and dissect each song but i wont. Although, \\"Be Yourself\\" could have been one of the greater modern rock radio tunes of all time if they had worked out a stronger chorus. It ends up just being a very mediocre typical lead single. Its definitely a good album for people like me who wish the music scene today was as good as it was in the 90s <br /> <br /> <br />Other highlights: Your Time Will Come, Doesn't Remind Me, Out of Exile, Drown Me Slowly, Man or Animal.
B000055Y0X|3.0|This satirical film made by Stanley Kubrick is a little bit of a confusing movie to me. You really have to understand what was going on during the time period of which this movie was made or you would have had to be alive during this time in history, unlike me. This movie makes fun of the U.S. military during the 1960's and the way the whole country thought about Russia or as they and I like to call them the \\"Ruskies\\". The whole pretty much goes with some crazy general ordering his troops to go drop nuclear bombs on Russia and is the only one who knows the recall code. The whole movie the president and his staff are trying to recall the planes to stop the nuclear attack since Russia has built a \\"doomsday device\\" where if anyone drops a bomb on Russia the whole world will be destroyed. It turns out you don't even find out who Dr. Strangelove is until at least half-way through the movie.The movie not all that bad but i found that many parts were confusing or misleading in some way. But some parts make sense like the famous quote, \\"Gentlemen, there is no fighting in here, this is the war room!\\" Which was voted as one of the funniest lines in movie history.As it turns out they do finally discover the code but face one huge problem along the way and if you really want to find out you might want to buy this movie. But if you're like me and don't have as much knowledge about this time of history then I would recommend not to buy this movie. Actually I would only recommend this to an older person around 30 because they grew up in this time and would probably find it absoulutely hilarious. All in all this was an ok film and I would not watch it on my own time. <br />
B00003CXAR|5.0|JAWS, one of the finest films in Cinema history <br />From start to finish, this film will have you captivated.  <br />If you have not scene the film, rent or buy it today without further thought. <br />Forget what it may do to your perception of ocean activities, it's worth viewing.  <br />
B00020HEL6|3.0|What is it with all these incredibly talented underaged girls.  Renee Olstead, Joss Stone and several others that I'm drawing a blank on are turning out some of the most soulful, sexiest music available today.  A great selection of standards that benefit from the stylings of David Foster.<br /><br />She does a great take on Summertime, Taking a Chance on Love, Someone to Watch Over Me and What a Difference A Day Makes.  If you like great female jazz vocal performances this is one to enjoy and a talent to watch
055357342X|5.0|I really loved this book. I read it in just under a month, which is astonishing for me and a book of this length considering how little time I usually devote to reading. I just couldn't put this one down though and once finished, it left me craving the 4th book. <br /> <br />---About the series--- <br />I have to say that for folks who like fantasy fiction, this series is probably a must. It is rich and thick with detail, cleverly constructed, and written extremely well. It steps out of the redundant pattern of most fantasy novels, and doesn't dwell in the land of mysticism. Rather, the story revolves around the lives of royalty and the conflict between them. Great (or not so great) men and women who vie for power through manipulation, treachery, deception, war, and betrothal. You get to see the inner struggles of each house as they fight to stay on top, or just stay alive. <br /> <br /> <br />---About this book--- <br />This book picks up not exactly where the other book finishes but rather the first portion of this book is taking place in parallel to events that are happening near the end of the last book. <br /> <br />The story escalates onward as the different kings from around the land fight for power. Wars rage and kings start dying along with their hosts. The land beyond the wall springs to life as the wild \\"free men\\" that live there make their march following the \\"King Beyond the Wall\\" and start southward, preparing to get through the wall and invade the lands of Westeros. <br /> <br />Meanwhile in a land to the east, the princess Daenery's, mother of dragons, is mounting her crusade and building an army to invade the lands that were once ruled by her heirs. <br /> <br />The rightful heir to the throne of Westeros, aided by his mysterious \\"red sorceress\\" (Melisandre), vows to kill the usurpers and take his place as the soul King of the land. Throughout this, Melisandre reminds him that he is the chosen one to bring balance to the land that he only can lead the fight that is to come. The fight for survival of the whole realm of mankind against the gathering darkness that she foresees in \\"the flames\\". <br /> <br />---My take--- <br />This might possibly be my favorite book of his series so far. Thay've all been good, but this one was driving. It's pace was relentless in that each event was so grandiose, you just didn't want to stop reading. Each building on one another to create a multi-leveled complexity of storylines that kept me intrigued the whole way through. As characters started dying off, or coming into power I found myself shifting who I cared more about in the story, and some I could care less about. Martin writes in such a way that gives you this ethereal objective viewpoint as you sit back and watch the events unfold from all the angles of this story at once. <br /> <br />---Recommendation--- <br />This, like the other books in this series, is another phenomenal example of fiction. A story that transports you to another place and lets you drop deep into the heads of these characters. I highly recommend this book as well as the first two. Like the second book, you should read the first books before you read this one.
B0001611DI|5.0|DAWN OF THE DEAD...it just oozes with fright and serious zombie innovation. This sequel to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD really lives up to its predecessor in ways that most horror film sequels do not. The best part, that there are true hints of comedy thrown into the mix of gore, terror, scares, and what is the most blatant poke at 'consumerism'.  <br /> <br />'DAWN' picks up apparently where the first 'DEAD' left off, with a band of survivors trying to escape the wrath of the all the mindless zombies that have infested the country (and probably the rest of the world). They head to a shopping mall where, to their dismay, they find more flesh-eating zombies waiting for them. In the beginning of the movie, there is a segment that will make you cringe as some officials reach the basement level of a complex and find a horde of zombies feasting on flesh. The survivors inside the mall find they must now band together what they need and rely on each other to survive, and unfortunately not all of them do survive, but this is where the blatant poke at 'consumerism' really comes into full effect. It's very funny, very obvious, but also a thread in the spool of the movie. It's an integral part of DAWN OF THE DEAD, but so are the horde of zombies. My favorite part is the segment where a zombie comes walking towards Roger while he gases up the helicopter, and instead of actually making it that far, his head gets cut off by the copter blades because he walks way too close to them. That is a comical moment, but also a scary reminder that there aren't enough bullets in the world to kill off all the zombies. <br /> <br />DAWN OF THE DEAD is another masterpiece from the wicked mind of George A. Romero, and while DAY OF THE DEAD would follow a slightly different path, DAWN OF THE DEAD is another reminder that horror really had plenty of genius left in its twisted little world. (Make sure you get the rare but find-able 137 minute unrated director's cut of this version, you'll be glad you did)
B00008J2DQ|4.0|There are really two things you can think when you listen to this album. You can think \\"Faceless\\" is either repetitive with no variety and is hardly distinguishable from Godsmack's other two albums. Or, you can think that this is a grooving, grinding, stomping metal album that pulls no punches. Personally, I'm a little in between the two. It's hard to dismiss the similarities this album has with past 'Smack albums (especially 2000's \\"Awake\\"), but the well-trained ear should be able to tell the difference between this album and \\"Awake,\\" because this album is more fluid. Next, some of Sully Erna's lyrics (i.e. \\"Take me away from this hell I've created\\") are so ridiculous and juvenile, they're almost laughable. Plus, Sully's vocal style (constant howling) grows weary, as well. Fortunately, these songs have more than enough good guitar work to make up for it. Guitarist Tony Rambola plays one good, hard hitting riff and grooving (albeit rather short) solo after another. \\"Straight Out Of Line\\" is probably the catchiest and best song on the album. It opens much like Metallica's \\"One,\\" but then the guitars fade in and Tony unleashes a barrage of riffs and even a pick slide. The title track has catchy wah-wah guitars and \\"Make Me Believe\\" is fast and almost explosive. Other highlights include the catchy and groovey \\"Re-Align,\\" which has the album's longest guitar solo, \\"I F****** Hate You\\" which is a great mosh pit anthem with a pounding, head kicking riff, and \\"Releasing The Demons.\\" There are a few duds, though. \\"The Awakening\\" is rather pointless, and \\"Serenity\\" is too similar to \\"Voodoo,\\" but it's not as good (\\"Serenity\\" has mediocre lyrics and sub-par vocals). All in all, this isn't the best metal album released in 2003, and the songwriting on display here is only negligible. But in an age full of bands like Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, and Linkin Park, it's somewhat refreshing to hear a metal album with its edges still on.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|SAW is one of those movies it will take you repeated viewings to dissect certain parts and understand the plot and the importance of the characters, and boy are you in for one hell of a surprise ending when you see it for the first time. This is one of the best suspense horror movies in recent years, and hopefully SAW II will be no different.    SAW tells the tale of a serial murderer known as the \\"jigsaw killer\\" who decides to kidnap two men, one is a doctor who is married to a beautiful wife and has children with her, while the other man seems very insignificant to us, not bearing any importance or meaning to us in the movie, except that he committed some kind of heinous act according to the the killer. Both of these men are put in dank room with dirty white walls and a mysterious body lying in the middle of the room (and we're to believe that it's dead). The doctor (played by Cary Elwes) is handcuffed by the ankle to a fixture, and the other man is handcuffed by his wrist, and this ultimately becomes the precursor of an evergrowing race to break free and stop the killer himself. The jigsaw killer is committing a series of grisly killings, all the while tormenting the two men he has trapped. The movie's tension builds and paramounts into a shocking and grisly climax that ultimately descends into the movie's surprise ending...you will never see this coming, trust me. It worked quite well to jolt my chill factor. And this new UNCUT edition of the movie is even more grisly. You are going to be even more repulsed by this smart horror film.    SAW spins a web of suspense, scares, and brains into a complex and jolting thriller that most certainly will prepare you for what's to come with it's follower, SAW II. Enjoy!
0767830555|5.0|Travis Bickle is a social pariah. He can't sleep and needs something to do, so he decides to work the night shift as a New York City cabbie. Travis ruminates (in his journal?) about his difficulties making companionships in his life as well as his dislike for all the filth on the streets. Travis's loneliness, a more concrete manifestation of his alienation problem, is a driving force for his nose dive into psychosis. He hates what he sees in the city until Betsy (Cybil Sheppard) appears as a beacon of light on the street dressed in white. His pursuit of Betsy describes his manic quest for unobtainable companionship and purity. Yet, while his behavior indicates his loneliness, Travis consistently doesn't really know why he keeps behaving badly and often sabotages his own attempts to end his loneliness. For example, his date with Betsy is made unbearable by poor choice of movie. Loneliness is the emotional manifestation of the alienation Travis experiences; it is both a source of great pain and a source of psychosis. He does not understand common social topics, such as popular music, politics or love. His failed attempt at conventional companionship with Betsy leads to his warped effort to be a knight errant for young prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster).<br /><br />Travis's psychotic descent ends in a trail of destruction and blood. To save Iris from her life of prostitution, he becomes an army of one. All pimps and Mafiosos in his way die a brutal death. After an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Travis dies quietly on the couch as the authorities enter the building (interesting camera angle). Then, the strange denouement begins. The ending must be seen as a brief flash of his life. The closing scene reflects how Travis would like his life to be remembered. Director Martin Scorsese utilized a similar method in \\"Last Temptation of Christ\\" when Jesus sees his life as would be if he got down from the cross. In movie time, the scene takes about a half hour, but the scene only takes a flash to play in Jesus' head prior to his actual death on the cross. Whereas Jesus fantasizes about life as a mortal and dies as a savior, Travis fantasizes about being a savior and dies as a mortal. During last scenes of Taxidriver, Travis dreams himself as a hero who makes amends with Betsy, receives a grateful letter form Iris's parents and makes friends with his fellow cabbies. The last scene is just a pre-morbid flash in his mind before his lights go out for eternity.<br /><br />Taxidriver is set in the pre-Giuliani streets of New York, depicted with all its sin and psychosis. Nighttime in New York is filled with explosive violence, pervasive cynicism, and ubiquitous prostitutes. Director Martin Scorsese even indulges himself in such small details as a depiction of a street drummer, traveling gun salesman, and failed store robbery as side trips in Travis's long journey. Travis's disgust for the streets is depicted in his need to clean the semen and blood off his seats after his shift is over.<br /><br />Several small events act as harbingers to Travis's violent rampage. Travis is made to listen to a customer's (played by Martin Scorsese) ravings while the philandering wife's silhouette is visible from the street. The customer discloses to Travis the merits of the 357 magnum and what it will do to his wife when he shoots her. Also, while innocently shopping at a local grocery store, Travis successfully breaks up a robbery.<br /><br />Awesome movie. What a cast: De Niro, Shepherd, Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle. But the best character may be the streets of the city themselves. Scorsese gives the cold pavement of New York an actual living presence in the movie. Smoke, water, blood, grit.only takes a flash to play in Jesus' head prior to his actual death on the cross.

B000B8IA2G|4.0|There have been several good, in-depth reviews of this show already posted by others here. Not much to add... only this;    Stargate Atlantis is a great show, an evolution of the Stargate world, but not revolutionary. I never miss an episode, I like the cast (though basically getting rid of Rainbow was wrong imho) and the storylines are excellent. BUT, there is room for improvement. I'd like to see more romance evolve, I'd like to see the humans go on the offensive against the wraith, and I'd like to see a few cross-over episodes each season.    Seeing as how this is supposed to be a review of the DVD box set I would say that if you haven't seen this show before its an inexpensive way to buy many hours of entertainment for those cold winter nights, or maybe even a few marathons on the cold, snowy weekends. If you buy this DVD set you will want to tune into the SciFi channel to catch up with season two. You will more than likely become a fan of the show.    If you already watch the show and are thinking of collecting the series on DVD the price is excellent. I like to think of it this way; when I retire and have the time to spend watching great films and TV shows that I loved, having these sets is comforting. And lets not forget the times you might think \\"Gee, it would be nice to watch a few episodes of Atlantis\\"...   Stargate:Atlantis is not the best show on TV, that belongs to Battlestar Galatica, but its still great scifi, and entertaining as well.     [...]
0812975219|2.0|I studied finance with the best professors in the field at one of the Ivy League institutions but never have I heard from any of them the kind of self-complimentary stuff you will find in this book. I paid $12 for the book mainly because the cover looks clever and the review about a hand grenade rolling down Wall Street sounds like it could be read either way. I also bought The Misbehavior of Markets by Benoit Mandelbrot used for $5. I read about 100 pages of this book here and decided that I would just throw it away. The book may have been of interest for those with little formal education in the working of the financial market and so are still awed by big talks by one of the street's traders but people who have even one advanced course in finance would find this book boring, unoriginal, and the author a terrible bragger at best. <br /> <br />By contrast, the book by Benoit Mandelbrot, though somewhat esoteric and not conclusive, stands somewhere near the classics of books on the new wave in finance. I highly recommend it to the serious reader and learner while advise against buying this fooled by randomness book. I learned nothing from the author. I could have written a better book with deeper insights and fewer compliments for my own self.
B00006G8LB|5.0|(Just a quick note, that was a song from areosmiths  version, not the original)  <br /> <br />Well... I saw this film the other night after the documentry. I was intrested to see this film because watching a bullied kid turn into his bullies worst nightmare is possible the greatest form of entertainment I can think of. I particulary enjoyed the part were Spiderman chases that crook who killed his uncle, ther are points in the film were Spidey and the green goblin duel, and we catch up with the idea that this is like watching power rangers (who miss a flying rocket but still trip over and nearly die) Spiderman was excellent in all meanings of the word, a bit basic, you must admit, the typical ways of making such a film, The FX are effective yet there are points were we can see that its FX and not a real life spiderman. But never mind.
B000002J09|5.0|I don't like that they are put in \\"Heavy Metal\\" category. What the \\"Heavy Metal\\" means exactly? Both Jimmy Page and Robert Plant told in an TV interview they totally opposite that calling. Because the one-third is acoustic. <br /> <br />However if I need to accept the \\"Heavy Metal\\" category, that should be \\"Heavy and Metal\\" or \\"Heavy Rhythm and Metalic Guitar Sound\\". I have been feeling Page's acoustic Guiter sound is metalic, \\"Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Going to Calfornia\\" here. In \\"Babe I'm gonna leave you\\" from Zep1, the guitar sound was indeed acoustic. But since \\"Thank you\\" from Zep2, Page's acoustic guiter had been not that acoustic sound, soft, deep, and warm sound, that metaric, sharp, and thin sound. <br /> <br />This 4th album, four symbols, ZOSO, whatever, shows thier music color is so verious and also unique. <br />Probably each fan has different favorite number. <br />My favorites would be, if I was forced to choose, \\"Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Four Sticks\\". These numbers may not be powerful as the fans expect in the Zeppelin but very unique and having special taste. <br />
1582403589|5.0|All right.  So I walked into this comic store and spotted this graphic novel on the shelf and bought it.  Why not?  I dig Brian Keene.  I dig Romero.  Why the heck shouldn't I dig this?<br /><br />I took it home.  Read it.  Read it again.<br /><br />The next day I was back in the comic book store, hunting up volume 2.  And volume 3.<br /><br />I'm a believer.  This is such a well written thoughtful story.  The zombies are secondary to the plot and charecterization.  It kind of reads like a soap opera B-movie.  Wonderfully compelling.  I handed it off to my wife, who hates zombies, and she loved it.<br /><br />Like the dead things we are, we'll keep coming back for more of THE WALKING DEAD.  I recommend this one highly.
B000002C1W|5.0|It seems that the problem most reviewers have with 'A Momentary Lapse of Reason' is that Roger Waters was not involved and hence it did not sound like a Waters record. What they overlook is that this album stands out as a good album on its own regardless of who did or didn&#8217;t make it. It&#8217;s the typical wanker lament, that it doesn&#8217;t carry the right name makes all the difference. But it's wasn't 1972 anymore Waters had gone (and didn't his career skyrocket afterwards) and the music scene had progressed for good or bad depending on your point of view. <br /> <br />That said, the album is a split personality.  The first half is sensational, the second a little spasmodic but still OK. The first 4 songs (excluding the first track which is a short intro) are among my favourite tracks from the 1980s and among my favourite Floyd songs, period (can&#8217;t go past &#8220;Wish You Were Here&#8221;). From the march of &#8220;Dogs of War&#8221; to the to the  melancholy &#8220;On the Turning Away&#8221; to the radio friendly (and don&#8217;t the Floyd fanatics hate that) &#8220;Learning to fly&#8221; and &#8220;One Slip&#8221;, its as good as any record made at the time. The second half of the album is more experimental and more standard issue Floyd, if not exactly in sound then perhaps in formulation. And it ends with the stunning &#8220;Sorrow&#8221;. <br /> <br />But the main reason I like this record is exactly why a lot of others don&#8217;t, Dave Gilmour&#8217;s guitar playing. This album is awash with it. Some complain that this should have been called a Dave Gilmour album and I don&#8217;t have a problem with that, but once again that speaks of elitism and not of the quality of the record. After all it doesn&#8217;t matter who made the record as long as you enjoy the music. And I really like Gilmour&#8217;s guitar sound on this album. <br /> <br />For those baby boomers who cry foul at the Roger Waters less Pink Floyd and are too bogged down in self pityto listen to a record on its own terms, get over it already. <br />
B00006V9A0|2.0|...track selection is totally off the mark.  I'm not going to go in-depth except for the three non-album tracks that were included. <br /> <br />\\"You Know You're Right\\" starts off the album, and while this has been highly anticipated as NIRVANA's last song and all, it is shockingly a poor lyrical performance.  While the musical structure is somewhat different and even darker than selections from In Utero, it ends up following the soft-loud formula that Cobain had gotten sick and tired of, probably more than any of their songs.  From the formless live verison that was played at the Aragon in October '93, to the stunningly fragile solo version released on the boxset, we could see this song had a complexity about its lyrics.  Surprisingly, this version was recorded after both of those, and yet it seems as though the lyrics on this version were terribly dumbed down by Kurt.  My personal suspicion is that he didn't want to record this song with or even reveal any version with superior lyrics to Dave and Krist, and was waiting to do it over again after the band had broken up and he had possibly formed another group. Unfortunately, Kurt's life was ended before that could happen. <br /> <br />\\"Been A Son\\" is the version from the now-obscure \\"Blew EP,\\" which featured several other songs that can now be found on numerous NIRVANA albums.  Most NIRVANA fans like myself take exception with this song because somehow, it ends up being on nearly every album the band has released; and this version may in fact be the worst, as it was recorded in 1989 at the Music Source Studios.  This session has become notorious amongst NIRVANA fans for featuring muddy, truly grungy renditions of songs that Cobain thought turned out so bad that he re-did all but one of them over again at subsequent sessions, with Dave Grohl at the drums.  In this version, Chad Channing's drumset is failing, and the tentativeness really blurs through and ruins all the tracks, including this one.  Also, Cobain's vocals are nowhere near as energetic as the version that was released on \\"Incesticide\\" and sound disinterested. <br /> <br />\\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" might be the highlight of the album.  When NIRVANA released their album In Utero, a huge controversy had been brewing between record producer Steve Albini and the band's record label, Geffen, over what Albini claimed was excessive remastering and post-production work that ruined the album in his eyes.  Two songs were definitely remixed on the release by Scott Litt--\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies.\\"  This album finally officially releases Litt's redux of \\"Pennyroyal Tea,\\" a song which featured an excellent vocal performance by Cobain but which happened to be hidden amongst the many layers of guitar that were in the original version.  While nothing has been removed, Litt brings Cobain's vocals up more prominently in the mix, and puts more emphasis on the softer parts of the song, so that the guitar doesn't \\"jump out\\" at you.  You can definitely hear things in this version that were hidden in the In Utero version, that's for sure. <br /> <br />But like I said, other than Pennyroyal Tea, there's a lot of things wrong with this track selection.  Here is a list they should have gone with, which would have satisfied tons of fans new and old, and would have truly been a fitting tribute to Cobain's memory: <br /> <br />1.)  Aneurysm (from Incesticide) <br />2.)  Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter (Original Albini Mix) <br />3.)  School (from Bleach) <br />4.)  Sliver <br />5.)  Dumb (Original Albini Mix) <br />6.)  In Bloom (Original Mix by Butch Vig) <br />7.)  Come As You Are <br />8.)  Breed (Original Mix by Butch Vig) <br />9.)  Lithium (Original Butch Vig Mix) <br />10.) Spank Thru (unreleased, featuring Dale Crover on drums) <br />11.) Love Buzz (from Bleach) <br />12.) Sappy (from the No Alternative compilation) <br />13.) Pennyroyal Tea <br />14.) About A Girl <br />15.) Polly (Original Butch Vig Mix) <br />16.) Lounge Act (OriginalButch Vig Mix) <br />17.) Rape Me (Original Albini Mix) <br />18.) Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam (from With The Lights Out boxset, Disc 3) <br />19.) Where Did You Sleep Last Night (unreleased, from November 91 radio session) <br />20.) All Apologies (Original Albini Mix) <br />21.) Heart-Shaped Box (Original Albini Mix) <br />22.) Blew (from Bleach) <br /> <br />So 10 of the 14 songs are still there, but with never-before released original mixes of their studio versions, and then 12 more songs that they could have fit that I picked based on how often and for how many years the band had been playing them at shows (I counted track time too...their version is somewhere around 40 minutes?  With my additional 12 songs, it maxes out at 78 minutes).  Casual fans would have picked this up as an intro to the band, and die-hards would also have come running because of the original mixes (which I'll admit we die-hards love to hear, see the NIRVANA boxset :) )  Basically, it would have been a tracklist suitable to what Kurt would have wanted, based on his selections over the years at shows, and would have fit with the sound he would have wanted as well (unmixed, raw, and punk, with the exception of a few songs like Pennyroyal Tea and Come As You Are).  Also, it would have given fans their money's worth of tracks instead of robbing them of 30 minutes worth of space which could have been filled by some of the above tracks. <br /> <br />Now that would be a release, but sadly this appears to have been rushed through at the last minute due to the leaking of \\"You Know You're Right\\" on the internet.  Thankfully, we got \\"With The Lights Out\\" last year, and that was a fitting tribute for the die-hard fans. <br /> <br />My advice to casual fans:  Avoid this disc at all costs, pick up Nevermind instead.  While Andy Wallace's mixes on the track were the reason why Cobain ended up hating the album, it still has half the songs featured on this disc and is still considered one of the best album of the '90s.  If you like that, move on to In Utero, and if you like that, you're all set :)
B000AU9UYM|5.0|The fact that it took eight years for a new Batman film to be released illustrates how freaked out the studio was over the commercial and critical failure of Batman and Robin. Warner Brothers gave the franchise a much needed rest while they quietly looked for someone to reboot it. At first, it looked like Darren Aronofsky and Frank Miller might be the ones but the studio didn't like their vision. Then came screenwriter David S. Goyer and up-and-coming director Christopher Nolan who decided to return the Dark Knight back to his roots. They wanted to explore what motivated Bruce Wayne to dress up like a giant bat and wage war on the criminals of Gotham City. By all accounts, their effort, fittingly entitled Batman Begins, was a resounding success. The critics loved it and audiences flocked to the theatres to see it. So, what did they do right?<br /><br />The casting. While anyone can disappear into the bat suit and look scary it's playing Bruce Wayne that is the real challenge. To date, only Michael Keaton has pulled it off because he brought a complexity to the role. Christian Bale, who has proven that he's got considerable acting chops with an impressive resume, perfectly captures the essence of the tortured billionaire. Also gone are the obvious casting of marquee names like Jim Carrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger in favour of reliable character actors like Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and Rutger Hauer. They bring sincerity and just the right amount of believability to their roles. The only weak bit of casting is Katie Holmes who is utterly forgettable as the token damsel in distress.<br /><br />The story. Goyer and Nolan remain true to the spirit of Batman's origins as depicted by Bob Kane and Bill Finger (with a dash of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One), right down to how Bruce's parents are killed and how this torments him throughout his life.<br /><br />The tone. The campiness of the Joel Schumacher films is gone, replaced by a darker, brooding vibe. Nolan brings an art house sensibility to a big budget superhero film which gives it more substance. He treats the source material with the respect that it deserves.<br /><br />This is the best Batman film to date. It even surpasses Tim Burton's first one. While he certainly got the look of Batman's world and even understood the character's tortured psyche, he injected moments of silliness that took one out of the film (i.e. the Joker shooting down Batman's plane with a handgun?!). Nolan does not make this same mistake and he has created an excellent comic book adaptation that deserves to be ranked with other superior examples of the genre.<br /><br />The first disc features spoof of the movie called \\"Tankman Begins\\" that Jimmy Fallon did for the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. It basically inserts Fallon and Andy Dick into the movie at certain key points.<br /><br />Also included is a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with \\"The Journey Begins,\\" which looks at Nolan's vision for Batman. He wanted to depict his world realistically and talks about working with co-screenwriter Goyer who in turn talks about what he wanted to do with the character.<br /><br />\\"Cape and Cowl\\" is a featurette on the Batman costume and how Nolan and his team tweaked the traditional design to resemble a combat outfit. We are given insight into the process of how it was made.<br /><br />\\"Gotham City Rises\\" takes a look at the creation of Gotham City and the Batcave. The visual effects techies show us how they achieved the dense, complex cityscape through CGI, models and actual, elaborately constructed sets.<br /><br />\\"Path to Discovery\\" explores Bruce Wayne before he became Batman. Nolan and Goyer built his backstory up in an attempt to get the audience to emotionally invest in the character.<br /><br />\\"Shaping Mind and Body\\" takes a look at Bale's preparation for the role. Nolan wanted to get away from The Matrix-style wire-work for a more, visceral style. Bale had to learn a martial arts hybrid known as Keysi and did all of his own fight scenes.<br /><br />\\"Genesis of the Bat.\\" Nolan wanted to stick close to Batman's origins in the comic book and fill in the gaps that the comics had created. Nolan and Goyer worked closely with DC Comics for source material, including \\"The Long Halloween,\\" `70s era Dark Knight material by Denny O'Neil and Neil Adams, and Frank Miller's Batman: Year One.<br /><br />There is also a gallery of various movie poster designs from all over the world that feature some really cool looking takes on how to advertise this new take on the Batman mythos.<br /><br />\\"Tumbler\\" focuses on the designing and constructing of the film's Batmobile. Nolan worked on it while writing the screenplay. We also see it being tested and built.<br /><br />\\"Saving Gotham City\\" takes a look at the exciting monorail chase scene that takes place during the climatic part of the movie. Not surprisingly, it was done with a mix of CGI, practical stuntwork and miniatures.<br /><br />Finally, there is a 72-page mini-comic book that includes three stories that inspired Goyer and Nolan's screenplay.learn a martial arts hybrid known as Keysi and did all of his own fight scenes. <br /> <br />\\"Genesis of the Bat.\\" Nolan wanted to stick close to Batman's origins in the comic book and fill in the gaps that the comics had created.

Maybe because I love electronic music and am not over 40, I find all their later albums good.  If anything, I really didn't like their early 80's stuff.  It's probably just a generational thing.  Anyway, on to the new one.  This album, of course, is awesome.  It is an experience all the way through.  To pick favorite songs would be unfair.  This album is good from track 1 to the last.  If you are a Mode fan or a fan of electronic music then this is a sure buy.
B000AP2ZLM|4.0|I love the music, I love Cryptopsy but Lord Worm aint so great. The only thing that bugs me about this album is his voice. I really would have wished for some throat like in None So Vile but you cant always get what you want...
B0001L3LUE|5.0|\\"The Fog of War\\" is an excellent documentary directed by Errol Morris, and based on several interviews that Morris made to Robert McNamara. In my opinion, this is a documentary that everybody should see for its educational value. Despite that, please don't be scared: it is also very engaging, and consequently it is unlikely you will be able to turn it off once you have started to watch it.<br /><br />Far from being a film that glorifies McNamara, this is a documentary in which the former Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations expresses his opinions sincerely, and privileges the facts even if they don't always make him look well.  Moreover, \\"The Fog of War\\" includes visual and audio footage of historical value that backs up many of the things that McNamara points out, and that will be of interest to those who would like to learn more about Mr. McNamara, but also about American history.<br /><br />At the time in which this documentary was filmed, Robert McNamara was 85 years old, and said that he was at a point in his life where he could look back and draw some conclusions regarding what he did in the past. Needless to say, the spectator will be grateful to be allowed to hear his opinions about his life, and the events that he participated in.  McNamara lived during the Cold (\\"Cold War... Hell, it was a hot war\\"), and went through the Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam, among other things. He was a professor, worked in the military, as president of Ford and as Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War. McNamara didn't led a boring life, and he tried  to take advantage of his experiences (\\"My mission in life is to understand\\") in order not to make the same mistake too many times.<br /><br />I was shocked by the casual way in which he talked about the death of Japanese civilians during Second War II (\\"I was part of a mechanism\\", \\"I had to make it more efficient not in the sense of killing more people but of weakening the adversary\\"). I was also somehow surprised by some acute observations McNamara made regarding the nature of nuclear war, highlighting the fact that \\"There will be no learning period with nuclear weapons. Make one mistake and you're going to destroy nations\\".<br /><br />The way in which McNamara tells the interviewer that after learning new facts about old events he discovered that he had taken a completely wrong course of action is pretty interesting. The problem, in many cases, had to do with the \\"fog of war\\", that is the lack of complete information that doesn't allow those in charge to make informed decisions during a war. If possible, pay attention to what McNamara says about the Vietnam War and the Cuban Missile Crisis. You will probably find some of those revelations interesting...<br /><br />All in all, I think that \\"The Fog of War\\" is the best documentary I have watched so far, and I highly recommend it to you. You might agree or not with Robert McNamara's eleven \\"lessons\\" and the things he says, but I am sure that you will find them interesting, and worth thinking about.<br /><br />Belen Alcatome acute observations McNamara made regarding the nature of nuclear war, highlighting the fact that \\"There will be no learning period with nuclear weapons.

B0000TB05A|5.0|This is simply one of the best visual, aural, cinemagraphic concert DVD's I've ever seen.  Extremely pleased with purchase, especially &lt;$10.  A steal; don't think twice.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|What a great set! Eric Clapton has disappointed me lately with his newer solo stuff, because it seems he's gone to \\"top 40\\" style pop and moved away from his roots. Forget any of that here. <br />In this concert, you see Eric with his old bandmates, and THESE are his roots. THIS is the stuff! THIS is the blues! <br />Jaw-droppingly fresh and simply wonderful. Every bit as good as Wheels of Fire which came out live in their prime. <br />Highlights are hard to pick out because it's all so good, but certainly \\"I'm So Glad,\\" \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart,\\" \\"Crossroads,\\" \\"Stormy Monday,\\" and \\"Sleepy Time Time\\" shine brightly. But there's nothing weak on the whole 2 disc set, it's all great
B00005JO0J|5.0|Although I became a fan of the series Firefly long after it had been unceremoniously cancelled on 'Fox', I decided to take a chance and bought the DVD boxset for the series in order to prepare myself for the movie 'Serenity'.  I fell in love with these characters and the universe they inhabit, and watching each episode seeing how awesome the show was made me even more upset that Fox had treated the show and Joss Whedon so terribly, and it also made me more than happy as I eagerly anticipated the release of 'Serenity', in the hopes that the story would continue as a franchise of films much better than the Star Trek films or even the recent batch of Star Wars films.      My fiancee and I went to see the film and we spent two glorious hours watching our favorite ensemble cast continuing their adventures, showing absolutely no signs that any time had passed, even though technically for them only a few months had passed, and for my fiancee and I only a day had passed since we had watched the entire series over the course of a few weeks leading up to the premiere of this movie.  and for many fans maybe a year or two had gone by, but anyway, seeing the film was a definite vindication for science fiction in general, because its not often that a series that barely lasted a full season gets turned into a major motion picture, but we can all be greatful that Universal has a much better appreciation for this show, these characters and the universe they inhabit than Fox did.      The movie itself is fantastic, and I know it may be a bit biased since I'm already a fan, but even if I weren't a fan of the show I'd still think it's a brillaint movie, and if I wasn't already a fan of the series, this movie would prompt me to become a fan, that's how good it is.      I can only hope that this movie will spark sequels or even a renewed television series, I don't know, stranger things have happened, but the one thing that's abundantly clear, the story of the crew of Serenity is far fromover. In fact, it's just beginning.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I know this review will be quickly lost in the multitudes of reviews to follow, but here goes: I am such a Depeche fan (49 years old, and they are my favorite group!), that I still love almost ALL of \\"Exciter\\", and \\"Ultra\\" is my second favorite (after \\"Violator\\"). This is the kind of album that I didn't quite warm up to at first and second listen, but now I keep finding so much of its undercurrent of melodies and inventive construction to keep revealing itself upon every listen. Definitely one of their best, and certainly one of their darkest. Dave Gahan's three songs are three of the albums highlights, too, so watch out Martin - if Dave leaves the band, it's his career to watch, not yours! 'John the Revelator': everybody loves it but me - I find it kind of one-note (needs some sort of melodic break in the middle). 'I want it all' is the album's 'Waiting for the night'. 'Precious' is one of the most gorgeous songs they've ever done. And finally, Martin has a nice voice....I just wish he'd leave ALL the singing to Dave, as I can only imagine how much more I would like the two \\"Martin songs\\" with Gahan singing instead. Overall, this is a no-miss album.
B000A7TFF4|5.0|<br />Just a couple brief remarks on the Japanese Special Edition. <br />The DVD is indeed Region-encoded and may not play on your home dvd player, if you live in North America. <br />The bonus-track, She is so Beautiful, is fine, but it does not really enhance this already excellent album.  So, if you're thinking of shelling out 50 bucks for this one track, you should know that it is a respectable, but lesser track from these outstanding sessions. <br />
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This box set brings together all three \\"That's Entertainment!' movies along with many, many extras and special features. Anyone who has a passing interest in musicals or Hollywood's classical era would be advised to get hold of these DVDs! <br /> <br />Each of the movies come along with introductions (by TCM host Robert Osborne) and a trailer, and disc 4 has `behind the scenes' featurettes on the films, as well as contemporary TV spots on the films' releases and footage from the premiers. <br /> <br />The high points for me are `That's Entertainment! 3', including its selection of out-takes such as Garland's `Mr Monotony' and the wry and illuminating commentary from Esther Williams and Lena Horne. There is also a great documentary on the making of `That's Entertainment! 3' that focuses on the talents behind the screen such as the choreographers, composers and arrangers - people who are often overlooked in favour of the stars. There are some great comments, such as the one by Ann Miller who points out how callous Busby Berkeley was for making her carry on tapping when she had a bleeding blister. <br /> <br />Finally, there is a treasure trove of out-takes on disc 4 featuring Garland, Horne, Williams, Allyson, and so on; not all of them are great, but they're all very entertaining!
B000ANVPPQ|4.0|John Wayne's funniest film has finally been given the royal treatment: a brilliantly sharp, colorful, widescreen picture with clear sound, commentary, and some fun extras. It was great to see Maureen O'Hara again--she looks wonderful! To the person who couldn't find the trailer and the corset feature, they are there, on a second page. Nothing is missing; it's a wonderful DVD.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I've been reading a lot of reviews for Batman Begins here, and a lot of comparisons have been made between Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" and this new one. The director who scores the most points depends on whose review you're reading. For many years different artists and storytellers have offered their interpretations of the caped crusader, and I think people have forgotten that Burton's Batman was released in 1989, 16 years ago; a different Batman for a different time. <br /> <br />Keaton's version of Batman was intimidating, and got the job done, but he wasn't the strike-fear-into-the-hearts-of-criminals kind of superhuman that batman really is--- speaking in that low growling voice, like Clint Eastwood, with a touch of psychopathic brio. He never really fit, though he wasn't bad. I think that was Tim Burton twisting things the way he likes to. Like making Jonny Dep Willy Wonka, which is a different complaint I won't digress into. Batman was a great movie by itself, and it was also the artistic vision of Tim Burton which gives it a flavor no one can match it because it has his quirky genius threaded into it.  <br /> <br />Batman Begins *feels* like a truer version Batman, because the other Batman films touched on his origin, but only gave us snippets--- scratching the surface, but never digging deeper. One thing about the old franchise was the comic book feel (especially after Joel Schumacher took over). Superman could come flying in to help, and no one would be surprised. But Batman Begins takes a more realistic approach, and shows you the vulnerable side of Bruce Wayne, and what really motivates him, makes him tic and explains how and why there is a Batman. <br /> <br />Batman seems more like Batman, and Alfred is a lot more than just the faithful butler who knows his secrets, we understand (the future police Chief) Gordon's motives, and this film is about the hero and not the multi-million dollar megastar villains. It is down-to-earth and believable--- something only Tim Burton's first two Batman films can compete with, even though there was more focus on the bad guys. <br /> <br />And Batman Begins had all the right people in all the right roles. When I heard Christian Bale was to be Batman I remembered how great he was in American Psycho, and I knew he had it in him. Who could prove to be a more loving a loyal Alfred than Michael Caine? Who could have been a more believable Ducard/Ras Al Ghul than Liam Neeson, if one guy knows how to be a sensei/mentor it's him. He taught Obi Wan, didn't he? Gary Oldman is perfect in everything. Katie Holmes was the beautiful girl-next door, not glamorous and not a damsel in distress screaming from one end of the movie to the other, like our gorgeous Vicky Vale was. You tell me who Bruce Wayne would be likelier to fall in love with. The presence of Morgan Freeman and even Rutger Hauer make this ensemble cast exactly what the Batman Franchise needed. <br /> <br />Some reviewers make a good point about how fear is the theme of Batman Begins, and it's all about facing down fear, controlling it and using it. Maybe they could have roped in the fear angle a little. However, it showed me what I didn't truly understand until Batman Begins--- that the Batman's best device for getting justice was turning fear on people who use fear; for ordinary citizens to see that they have someone on their side that scares the bad guys gives them strength to stand against it, and when its all said and done Gotham will be able to take care of itself and I understand Batman's purpose. So thanks to Christopher Nolan for revitalizing a dying franchise, and here's to more Batman films like this one. <br /> <br />Wow... This wasn't much of a review... It's more like an essay on Batman, but I hope it helped someone.   <br />
B000001FS6|5.0|\\"Angel of Harlem\\" was the song that made me fall in love with U2 at the tender age of 11. I know, I know, but I wasn't a fan of Joshua Tree like everyone else. [gasp!] Really! This is my second-favorite album after War. And from the looks of it, I consider myself lucky to have missed the \\"accompanying\\" film. I love this album with its hodge podge of songs. I think that it shows U2's range of musical abilities, though not to its best, and how the band was growing as well.<br /><br />It was 'Rattle and Hum' that showed me in my tweens that music can be political and groundshaking, not just ditties about lust, cars, and melancholy. Even at that young age I recognized the homages to Billie Holiday, John Lennon, and Jimi Hendrix. I'm not a great fan of the blues, save Bessie Smith, (imagine: someone from Austin, Texas, not a fan of the blues, blasphemy!) so I'm not crazy about \\"When Love Comes to Town\\" or \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.\\"<br /><br />My personal favorites off this album are \\"Desire\\" of course, \\"Angel of Harlem,\\" \\"Heartland,\\" and \\"Bullet the Blue Sky.\\"<br /><br />I still love this album.
B00000G6H1|5.0|It's one of those 80's album I had fun listening (or bouncing) to.  It still holds up way above any of the current pop trash acts. The only thing that's missing on this cd are the liner photos or lyrics.  Other than that, it's going to be on my home and car stereo.  Nice album Olivia!
B000B7HZXM|1.0|I just purchased this CD today, and was very annoyed to discover that the sequence of the songs on the back of the case and in the liner notes does not match the sequence of the songs on the cd. All of the songs are there, but are just in a completely different order.  In response to this, I decided to call Sony BMG of which JRecords is affliated, and expalin the problem.  I was told that there was nothing they could do because in small print on the case it is written, \\"Please see cd label for sequence\\".  And sure enough, in little print that is written.  But that makes no sense whatsoever.  There is no reason for the song selections to be in a completely different sequence on the case.  I just think that it was a printing error and the company was too cheap to correct the mistake before releasing the CD.  I really like Rod Stewart's other CD's, but I am quite annoyed over this matter, not only because it is irritating for the listener to have to guess as to what song will play next, but because I expect higher quality from a company like JRecords.  In the end, I think that the company should correct the problem as soon as possible and replace the CD's for all of us who have already purchased it.  If you haven't purchased this CD yet, don't until the problem is fixed!

B000AP2ZLM|4.0|I bought this \\"Limited Edition\\" version of the cd, because I thought it would have some video or something of interest. <br />All it has extra is wallpepers,buddy icons & gallery!!! <br />I HATE DIGI-PACK CDS!! <br />I should have bought the jewel-case version. <br />BUT, now that my rant about how Century Media has tricked me into paying extra for crap... <br />The Music is AMAZING!!! <br />I'm so glad LORD WORM is back. To me, he's the only singer they should have. <br />There are some things in the production that could have been better, but overall it's awesome.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Few people would argue that 2003/2004 has been a great year period for the group.  Having dropped a debut (in the U.K.) that hit critical acclaim and very impressive retail performance, as well as key hit singles, and various 'Album of the year' awards in the music press, and winning the (U.K.) Mercury Music Prize award, as well very successful tours.  And now that the second album is upon us, it's time to go back to the debut and see how it stands up a year or two later. <br /> <br />When the band dropped this, their debut album, their manifesto was simple...\\"We want to make music that girls want to dance to!!\\".  The band consist of: frontman/singer/songwriter/guitarist \\"Alex Kapranos\\", guitarist/vocalist/songwriter \\"Nick McCarthy\\", bassist \\"Bob Hardy\\", drummer \\"Paul Thomson\\",  But as opposed to making a dance album, the band has taken the structure of indie-rock, and coloured their sound with danceable rhythms, and the angular guitar sounds of say: 'Talking heads, XTC...etc, and made urgent, energetic guitar music that has memorable arrangements, with witty or literate lyrics.  So although the band have been heavily promoted via their singles releases, it's actually something of a surprise to hear that, the album itself is actually a tight and focused album throughout, that isn't purely reliant on it's key singles for success. <br /> <br />\\"Jacqueline\\", kicks out the gate with a spritely energy that brilliantly sets the tone for the rest of the album, superb indie-rock that cleverly works insistent pounding drums, coupled with several chiming guitars and hummable chorus, with some excellent solo guitar work, made this track wholly deserving of being released as a single.  Hit Single \\"Take Me out\\", is arguably one of the finest tracks here....starting with a upbeat sparse staccato melody that makes you think the track is going to be the usual indie-rock fare, it throws a complete curve-ball, by breaking down slowly, and surging into a punk-funk styled song, complete with jerky guitar and a slightly weird rhythm structure, and add this with the memorable shouty chorus of \\"Take me Out!!\\", and you have a single that has that undeniable catchyness of something like 'Talking heads' finest singles.   <br /> <br />Another single that deserved it's critical acclaim was \\"Dark of the Matinee\\", with it's clever wordplay \\"I time every journey to bump into you accidentally, I charm you and tell you of the boys I hate...All the girls I hate, all the words I hate!!\\", and it's almost unapologetic funk riffs, that has a decidedly darkly humorous underbelly, and has an near confident swagger to their music, and if this track doesn't get girls onto the dancefloor...nothing will.  Although I'd heard the singles releases many times before listening to this album, and expecting them to be the best this album had to offer, I was surprised that it wasn't exactly the case.  As \\"Cheating on you\\", is arguably one of my favourites.  This is a sharp, and concentrated song, that pulls no punches, with filthy distorted speedy guitar, that has more in common with Punk music, than accessible pop music.  But once the band have layered frantic drums, and a softening of the instruments and thrown in some instantly accessible lyrics, the stuttering growl of the music, becomes arguably more accessible, for mainstream consumption. \\"Darts of pleasure\\" is again another storming track, that packs in a high quota of energy and bumping bassline, that feels like it has its tongue firmly in its cheeks with its random German chorus of \\"Ich heisse superfantastiche!\\", and feels like a compilation of all that the band is great for...high energy, and stylish tracks, with wry humour, pushed forward by chunky, angular guitars that propel the majority of tracks. <br /> <br />I have to admit that although I owned the album on it intital release, I never got around to actually sticking it on, and listening through.  I even sold my single disk edition and bought the American 2-Cd edition (which I very strongly recommend to everyone, as there is an excellent B-Side singles on the second disk), and it's only now, that the second album is upon us, that I've actually gotten around to listening to the album in full.  So although I'd already heard all the key singles, I wasn't familiar with the rest of the album, and I feel confident to say that I'm reviewing this debut album, without getting swept up in the hype surrounding its original release.  And I have to say that it really has stood up incredibly well, nearly some 2 years later.  It's a short sharp and incredibly condensed album that bears up under repeated listens, and although they literally seem to be everywhere, this hasn't had a negative effect on the music, that curiously manages to feature elements of everything from art-funk to polyrhythmic explorations and simple, melodic guitar pop, rousing new-wave, post-punk and rhythmic punk-funk, and remains freewheeling, quirky and cleverly sarcastic enough that, it eventually wins you over, even if you were a little sceptical to being with.  Easily one of the best U.K. debuts of recent years.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles started writing very strange songs around 1966 due to influences from Bob Dylan and various drugs (which were influenced by Bob Dylan). They had some crazy stuff indeed, a lot of which they will forever be remembered for, (more kids these days remember YELLOW SUBMARINE before they can identify with I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND.) This took them through the psychedelic phase and spit them out into 1968 with a barrage of weird, experimental stuff. The result was a classic album in which they simply called THE BEATLES; I believe that the idea was this wasn't the same Beatles you had grown acustomed to it was a new band. Either that or the banner was up that SGT.PEPPER and his band would no longer be on a Magical Mystery Tour and now The Beatles were back. (Thank God).<br /><br />This is a double album that is PACKED with all sorts of different material. It is a classic. Some of the best trippy songs they do are here, for instance HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN, is very cool; and HELTER SKELTER, the insane pre-punk song that supposedly drove Charlie Manson to lead all those murders. The bashing and screeching of guitars ain't nothing like The Fab Four had ever done before. There are also some really beatiful songs on here too though like DEAR PRUDENCE, WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS, and JULIA. Then you get some really fun cuts like EVERYBODYS GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE EXCEPT FOR ME AND MY MONKEY and DONT PASS ME BY. There are a few songs that are hard to deal with, but if you listen as a whole its a great mix all together. REVOLUTION 9 when played backwards will make you want to send Wally Gator a very large check. The information is all there.<br /><br />A good one BEEEEEEEE!!!!!!
0380973650|4.0|Shadow, the main character, is a likeable fellow. He is a model of a good-at-heart kind of a guy with his own sins or shortcomings to live. His surreptitious quest moves along pretty swiftly. Furthermore, Mr. Gaiman, the ultimate creator of amazing characters, is very perceptive of area slang all across the United States - at least, the route that Shadow trudges - and he amicably brings them alive on paper in compelling dialogues. His tale is a mixture of fantasy, myth, science fiction, love story, mystery, action, and comedy. All burning questions are duly answered at the end of the novel. Mr. Gaiman's brilliance and phenomenal inventiveness has resulted in a book that is a page-turner from the beginning until the end.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Leo Decaprio used to be on the goon list in my book. Pansie boy, but then he started to make some good movies. He made good with Martin Scorsese and I think this helped his reputation very much so, at least with me.<br /><br />As far as cool movies go, this takes the cake. I instantly knew I was in love with this movie within the first fifteen minutes, and that ain't even the beggining of the film yet.<br /><br />Starts off in 1846 with the protaginists DEAD RABBITS gang of irish immigrants. They are very quickly destroyed by Bill The Butcher (the coolest***** bad guy I've ever seen, played by Daniel Day Lewis)and his gang of New York natives.<br /><br />The film then moves on to 1863. The Five Points district, New York City. NYC 1863 will make the meanest city you've ever seen look like Candy Land. The police and fire departments are completley corrupted, politicians even more so. The gangs have more power over the city then anyone and Bill The Butcher pretty much has run over the Five Points.<br /><br />The story touches on many issues involving society at the time, and is incredibly interesting. (although many state that some of the points are fabrications and not fact- I don't care, does it really matter? Its a f*in movie.) The central story will drag you in, Decaprio comes back from the institute he was put in as a child by Bill after his father (priest and leader of the DEAD RABBITS) was killed \\"under his knife\\". He intends to get revenge by getting in close with Bill, who never has any clue who he is until much later in the film.<br /><br />Every charecter is genuine and believable, even the quiet charecters that appear here and there, have excellent roles.<br /><br />The dialouge all around is sharp and a real treat to listen to. Especially in Daniel Day Lewis with which every word that spews out of his wretched mouth is more enjoyable than the one before it.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz plays an excellent role as the sexy pick pocket lover to Decaprio. Very well done.<br /><br />The visual imagery is excellent all around (as always with Scorsese,) but the sets, the costumes, the battle scenes- all top notch and add so much. I'm living in this vision of a differnt NYC and I can't get enough!<br /><br />This movie was nominated for best picture and best director in 2003, and I truly thought it would snag both however it didn't. CHICAGO did (gay). This is still one of the best movies I have ever seen and lands very close to the top of all time favorites, YOU MUST SEE IT! MUST!

B00001NFCY|5.0|Creeds's second album, Human Clay, released on September 28, 1999, compiles a variety of moods that interest listeners of all kinds.  Creed uses brooding, angst-ridden, earnest, somber, and bittersweet moods.  This rock band produced many top hits for Human Clay.  The hits included Are You Ready?, With Arms Wide Open, and Higher. <br /> <br />Creed has been able to emerge as a top rock band in the 90's, where most popular hard rock is mainly rap.  They became one of the biggest selling rock bands in the 90's.  Creed has had to overcome great competition to become one of the best groups. <br /> <br />The band consits of a nice combination of vocals, bass, drums, and guitar.  The members of Creed:  Scott Stapp, Brian Marshall, Scott Phillips, and Mark Tremonti, show great chemistry in all of their works.  There hard work has paid off, which is shown through the millions of copies they sold of Human Clay.
B000002G8J|5.0|Next to 'Behind The Sun', this is my favorite Eric Clapton album. It is a top notch laid back 70s country western and blues affair with a top 40 hit in the perfect 'Promises'. Claptons voice has never been better than on that track. It is a quiet album, mellow and warm and it all goes down easy. Two OK Bob Dylan songs are covered, 'Walk Out In The Rain' (Clapton recently dusted off and reworked this song in his 2004 Concert Tour), and 'If I Don't Be There By Morning'. There are two fun rock and roll songs, 'Watch Out For Lucy' and 'Tulsa Time'. The other C&W song is 'Golden Ring' Where Clapton contemplates marriage. The stand out easy blues of 'Early In The Morning' is just fine as well. If you liked 'Slowhand', This is a great companion album.
B000AL730O|5.0|It's true.  If you read any of the reviews with 1 or 2 stars they are ill-advised and their laughable opinions have no relevance to the music on the album.  This is perhaps Paul McCartney's best album since Ram.  He has released some amazing songs in the last thirty five years, but this recording doesn't have any of the filler material that some of his earlier work had.   <br /> <br />From a musical perspective, \\"Chaos and Creation\\" is full of interesting and complex harmonies, beautiful melodies, brilliant orchestrations and highly skilled craftmanship in the form of songwriting.  McCartney has also managed to create some of the most poignant lyrics of his career, touching on recent events and people in his life, forlorn and sanguine alike. <br /> <br />Before you write a negative review, get your head out of the sixties and give the man an opportunity to continue to develop as an artist instead of expecting him to sound like the Beatles thirty five years later.  The Beatles were amazing.  But do you think we would know who they were today if they had stayed trapped in the past as many of you seem to want Paul to do?

My husband watched me crying and wanted to know all about the book and why it had touched me in this way.  Any parent would feel the same way after reading this wonderful story of a family how easily we could be in their shoes faced with awful decisions. I will tell everyone I know about this book and what a must read it is.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I have watched this dvd many times since receiving it.  It gets better and better each time you watch it.  Do yourself a favor and crank it up with headphones, through speakers, whatever it takes. <br /> <br />Being a Cream fan since day 1, and seeing them live back in 1968 (my ears rang for 3 days) and if you are a lover of blues, rock blues and rock, you will be glad you bought this dvd. <br /> <br />I have many concert dvd's in my collection, and being a good blues/rock blues guitarist myself (I am told by many), believe me, I watch what is going on with these guys and can be very critical about the whole deal.  They got it going on and are at the top of their game.  I absolutely loved it and look forward to watching these guys on this dvd for many years to come.   <br /> <br />Myself being a huge Freddie King fan since the early 60's, and knowing E.C. was a big fan of his too and also played with him, of course I have followed every nuance of Clapton's career since The Yardbyrd days. <br /> <br />Why even break it all down, just watch it and enjoy.  I can honestly say I am so happy these 3 greats got back together for who knows how long.  Definitely a breath of FRESH air with so much crappy music out there these days.  It is the real deal.
B000024D4R|5.0|One of my favorite Pink Floyd albums, this is the one that helped get me into Pink Floyd after I discovered Dark Side of the Moon. On this album, there are three songs (well, five but the first and last tracks are only intros and outros) that describe the three types of figures in society. The pigs are tyrannical, self-righteous hypocrites forcing their beliefs on the dogs and sheep; the dogs are greedy money-grubbing cutthroats; and the sheep are the mindless followers who are used and abused by the others. This is probably Pink Floyd's darkest album. \\"Dogs\\" is the best track and is also one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs.
B0002VHBTK|5.0|This has to be one of my favorites! Rarely do we see the portrayal of a complex concept done so beautifully, in a movie! This is all about using intense focus and trance to change a timeline. Lola runs and runs (the art direction is stunning), putting herself into a trance state which allows her to accomplish her mission. It is a brilliant example of how the mind can be used to change a timeline in a moment. I like how the different timelines or parallel realities are portrayed, and it is a great depiction of the quantum field in action. This film is beautifully art directed in the finest flavor of European filmmaking. Whether one has an understanding of quantum physics or not, it is entertaining and thought provoking. Definitely one for the library!
B000002U8G|5.0|This record signifies the beginning of the Pink Floyd most people know and love. Gone are the wildly experimental guitar and synthesizer sounds that graced every record before this one. What has taken its place is a controlled and planned sound, where improvisation has taken a back seat to orchestration. The epic 'Echoes' is a 23-minute \\"rehearsed\\" jam session, much like 'Shine On' and gives listeners insight of what's to come. All the songs are good, but \\"Echoes\\", \\"Fearless\\", and \\"One Of These Days\\" stand out as most memorable. \\"San Tropez\\" seems like it belongs on another album, like Piper or Atom, but so did \\"Have A Cigar\\" from Wish You Were Here, and \\"Seamus\\" is a humorous bluesy tune by Roger Waters about a dog.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old

B00005221M|4.0|James Fenimore Cooper's trusty old nineteenth century novel 'The Last of the Mohicans' has provided a surprisingly sound springboard for a film that tries and succeeds in restoring a profound respect for the Native Americans.  Yes, it is a story about the Indians and their culture descrated by the arrival of European entrpeneurs and colonists all relating to Hawkeye/Nathaniel Poe (Daniel Day-Lewis), who as a child was taken by the Mohawk tribe and raised by wise Chingachgook (Russell Means) with the graceful skills and philosophy of the Native Americans.  And it is through his eyes that we are brought into the universe through the eyes of the Indians.<br /><br />The story is well known and needn't be elaborated once again.  Suffice it say that Hawkeye becomes the scout who leads British family Munro including Colonel (Maurice Roëves) and his daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) into upstate New York and along the way find altercations with the French and with the Huron Indians, especially one Magua (Wes Studi) whose loathing for Munro's devastation of his village drives him to vengeance against the entire Munro family.  Hawkeye and his ally Uncas (Eric Schweig) protect their lieges while steadfastly holding to the honor of their heritage.  And of course during the harrowing events Hawkeye and Cora fall in love and Hawkeye takes great risks against his own life to ultimately defend Cora and her family.<br /><br />Yes, there are many battle scenes, great reenactment of the scenery of the novel, and villains in all camps that provide the stormy progress of the novel.  But it is in the quiet moments where Chingachgook speaks about the Great Spirit, the sanctity of nature, and his waiting to join the Great Council in the sky as the last of the Mohicans that the film's power is best communicated.  The acting is very fine and the cinematography is splendid.  This is a film worth seeing, one whose 117 minutes fly by leaving the viewer with a renewed respect for Native American philosophy.

Since then I have grown and this album has been my companion through it all. The music is touching and you are finally able to see George on his own writing some of the most beautiful songs out there. There isn't a bad track on \\"All Things..\\" and each of them can stand alone. <br /> <br />In all sincerity, this is one of the most beautiful albums ever created and I really can't put my thoughts into words on how much I love it. Even now that I work at a college radio station and I have listened to so many different kinds of music, I keep on coming back to this one album over and over again. <br /> <br />Thank you George.
B00005JOGU|5.0|It is much more difficult to write a review of a great movie. You worry about doing the film justice, giving the film its due, convincing other that this film is worthy.<br /><br />\\"Capote\\" is a great film. I can't think of enough superlatives to do the film justice.<br /><br />November, 1959. Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) sits in his apartment reading through the New York Times and spots a short item about the murder of a family on a farm in Kansas. Something about the article speaks to Capote, he can write about this and turn it into a great article for the New Yorker. He enlists the aid of his friend, and fellow writer, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), as his research assistant for the trip. Upon their arrival in Kansas, they meet with Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the lead investigator in the case, haunted by images of the crime scene and determined to find the killers. Dewey's wife invites Capote and Lee to dinner, thrilled to have a celebrity in the house, beginning a friendship with the Dewey's which leads to them sharing Christmas dinner. The meal is interrupted by a call from Las Vegas. The suspects have been captured. Capote remains in the small town, hoping for the opportunity to interview Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino). When Capote meets Smith, he realizes that he has enough for a book. But he needs an ending. How and when will the book end?<br /><br />\\"Capote\\", directed by Bennett Miller, written by Dan Futterman and produced by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, among others, is a great film. But I already said that, didn't I? See what I mean? It's difficult to do justice to a film like this.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about the film is Hoffman's portrayal of Capote. Before this film, my limited exposure to Capote has been his cameo in \\"Murder by Death\\" or various magazine pictures of him at parties throughout the Eighties. None of this gives you an idea of his life or his ability. The film, and Hoffman, quickly establish Capote's character. Enjoying success as a writer, and celebrity, he holds court during a party, recounting the story of another author telling him about his new book. This scene quickly establishes Capote's ego and his love of attention. After he finds the short newspaper article, we begin to see and sense many other layers to his character. He wants to be a great writer; as portrayed by Hoffman, we see that he valued celebrity as much as his skill. He wants to be in a loving relationship; his partner, author Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood) is working on a new novel and wants Capote to spend the holidays at home. Capote realizes that the research will take much longer and tries to assuage his lover about his absence. But the truly great thing about this performance is the relationship between Capote and Smith. Hoffman skillfully leads us to believe that Capote was attracted to Smith, helping him find lawyers, meeting with him for long periods of time. Was it all for the sake of a book, which Capote believed would be great? Or did he actually care about Smith? Or the Clutter family?<br /><br />As you watch Hoffman's performance you realize that there are many subtle contradictions in Capote's character. Hoffman brings these to life, in a completely disarming way. We feel like we are watching Capote in a documentary.<br /><br />Capote had a very stylized speech pattern and Hoffman captures it without stereotyping it or making light of it. It was simply how this man, who lived in many Southern communities growing up spoke.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, the Oscar race for Best Actor is over. Hoffman should get the statue now. Forget about all of the campaigning. There may be other very good performances to come, but I doubt there will be another performance as good as Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote.<br /><br />All of the supporting performances are pitch perfect. Catherine Keener, once again, does a great job as she brings author Nelle Harper Lee to life. She and Capote had Southern roots and the desire to be great writers in common. Capote clearly liked to surround himself with talent, as friends and associates, and he recognized that Lee would be a great writer as well. During their research in Kansas, Lee learns that her book \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" will be published. Over the course of writing \\"In Cold Blood\\", Lee's novel is published to great acclaim and made into a film starring Gregory Peck. Capote attends the New York premiere, but he is still so wrapped up in his own book that he can't come to terms with Lee's success, putting a strain on their relationship.<br /><br />Chris Cooper is outstanding as the tortured lawman. At one point, Capote helps Smith and Hickock find new lawyers. Dewey (Cooper) tells him that if he helps these two men get out of jail, he will personally come to Brooklyn and hunt Capote down.<br /><br />Clifton Collins, Jr. is also mesmerizing as Perry Smith. Collins has, frankly, never done anything this good. His last film of any note was \\"Mindhunters\\", the oft-delayed Renny Harlin mess released this summer. Collins manages to subtly convey that Smith may be just as manipulative as his new friend, Capote. He realizes early on that Capote needs him and once he gives Capote what he wants his new `friend' is gone. Throughout their relationship, they play a subtle game of cat and mouse.<br /><br />The beauty of the film is that it puts us in Capote's shoes. We experience all of the emotions that he experiences, see everything that he sees, and witness the events that he is present for. When he hears Smith's recount of the murders, he is visibly shaken, as are we, by the power of the words and images used.<br /><br />Rightfully, the film concentrates on Capote's life during the research and writing of \\"In Cold Blood\\". After the book was released, and acknowledged as a classic, Capote never really wrote anything that would earn him the attention or acclaim that he needed. It was essentially, the book he was meant to write and it would end his creative career. The rest of his life would be a shadow.<br /><br />\\"Capote\\" does that rare thing.

B00005YXZH|4.0|Jeff Tweedy found the perfect mix of fey, catty come-ons and rabblerousing gay disco glory on his 1999 release, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.    One song after another on this release culminates in Tweedy's \\"I smoke pot, I am a whiner and a proud silly man\\" ethos.  This thread provides continuity and the free-willy-nilly spirit that propels this brave musical work.  Sometimes he is banging on a drum, deperately searching for a rythmn or tune.  Thrilling!     It is hard to believe Jeff Tweedy's modest strumming and masterful mumbling can only last 70 minutes.  I wish Tweedy would sing his incessant, unending song for a million years.  One is reminded of the famous 2002 Wilco gig in Austin, TX when Tweedy's genius finally boiled over, killing some 70 people in the crowd.  It was a tragic scene of molten yuppie BMW keychains and stoner meleancholy, during which a molten ball of this material decended into hell, thousands of miles below.  Tweedy can easily do that at any time.  That's right folks, he is that powerful.  He made Bob Dylan cry numerous times.
B0007P3582|1.0|This has to be the worst rated album of all thime,(2.5 stars)LMAO. <br />I do agree this album is trash, i used to like G-Unit back when they first came on the scene, now i cant stand there garbage they call rap. All they do is brag, and talk about cars, guns, drugs, etc etc. All rappers who just rap about that are garbage, listen to some rap with meaning, you can really only find that back in the 90's, its a shame, if rap keeps coming out like this is gonna dispear right off the map, just like disco. One day its there the next its gone. And you can blame that all on G-unit and all the other commercial phonies. Listen to me when i say this, support rappers who are real, all about the art(yea rap was an art). Listen to my favorite rapper Cormega for example, listen to the lyrics in his music, it's poetical and has meaning, he does rap about drugs, guns, and cars, but his music is filled with inspiration and meaning, you commercial rap fanatics may have never heard of him mainly because he's big in the streets, mainly ny. Listen to him trust me. I reccomend \\"The Realness\\", i feel his best album. Anyway if your even thinking about buying this crap from 50cent, DONT!!!!. Every song is garbage, beats may be ok, but thats not what the music is all about. Pretty much anything that they play on radio or mtv, is usually gabage, and try to stay away from that, it gives rap a bad name. i hear it all the time, people making fun of rap, saying they only talk about drugs and guns and money, but thats the only rap they hear on the radio, and cmon who actually enjoys the commercial rap, 90% of the kids who listen to 50cent, Kanye West, Young Jeezy, and Jay-z, only listen to it because theyll think its cool. and it's not. I cant stand kids rappin 50 cent, thinkin there cool, but proly never stepped in the hood. It sickens me. Ill stop ranting but dont buy this garbage.
006097625X|5.0|I love this book.  Not only does it explain visual storytelling, and how we understand stories and comics, but also illustrates perfectly how you go about implementing the principle, \\"Show, don't tell\\", so vital to creating compelling stories.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in telling stories, of any kind.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I thought the new CD is actually pretty good.  i keep hearing many comparing it to violator but its not nearly as fast paced as that CD was.  I think it's closer to Ultra myself but MUCH better than Exciter.  The lyrics are \\"ok\\" on the CD not as good as there pre violator stuff.  As far as the music is concerned it is very good the sounds are just awesome.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|I've been a fan of Neils for 25 years now, and the Neil Young that I know, and have grown up with, is in this album - alive and well. From the moment I saw 'The Painter' video and listened to some tracks on his website, I couldn't wait to get my copy. This CD will get plenty of playtime on my CD player and my MP3 player. I cant get enough of tracks like The Painter, He was the King, It's a Dream, Here for You, and Falling Off The Face of the Earth. But if you want to hear that oh-so familiar sound that is unmistakably Neil Young, than you can find it in 'This Old Guitar'. A 'must' for any Neil Young fan.

0439574285|5.0|In college I went through a phase where I read all the Sherlock Holmes stories. Once I got started reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, I didn't want to stop. It was sad when I read the last story.<br /><br />Now years later it was fun to read them again. I enjoy the Sherlock Holmes short stories more than one of the novels. For me one of the most enjoyable parts of a Sherlock Holmes story is reading about what happened, and then reading how Sherlock Holmes solved the problem.  A collection of short stories provides this experience many times.<br /><br />This collection has many classics.  It has the famous line \\"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\\"  (The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet.)<br /><br />It is also interesting to see what life was like in England 100 years ago.  They had the underground, but use carriages, there was lots of travel by train, and life in general was a bit rougher than today.<br /><br />If you haven't read any Sherlock Holmes stories, this is a good place to start.

B000AU9UYM|1.0|Batman is nothing but Hollywood garbage from a director who has created much better films such as Following and Memento.  The plot is preposterous even though the creators claim they were trying to make Batman more realistic.  The train action sequence at the end, pardon the pun, completely derails the movie from any realism they attempted to create in the first half. Morgan Freeman pretty much recycles the same role he's played a million times.  I have no earthly idea why Nolan wanted to make a superhero film.  Your money is better spent elsewhere such as the new Skinny Puppy DVD The Greater Wrong of the Right.  Don't waste your money on another superhero film.  Give a message to Hollywood that you want something original and creative instead of the same old Hollywood schlock.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|This album brings nothing new to the table that Maiden or any other metal band from that era hadn't already done. With that being said, this album is fun as hell to listen to. No it's not that deep, lyrically or technically, but they can sure shred. They are a tight band with loads of talent. I miss the screaming, too, and I have a feeling that was the doing of some producer with Warner Bros. saying something like, \\"If you guys want this record to reach the masses (i.e. the lowest common denominator) you're gonna have to cut out all that screaming. The suburbanites just can't be rocked from their peaceful lives.\\" This is an album to drive fast to, nothing more, nothing less.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|I think it is hard to believe to anyone under the age of 35, but we used to worship Bob Dylan like a god. We obsessed about his album art, his liner notes, his comments, his lyrics, everything. There is nothing like it anymore. I really enjoyed this documentary because I could finally sit back as a middle-aged person and objectively look at Mr Dylan and his remarkable (first!) tranformation. My take home message? Even Bob does not understand Bob. I think, and bear with me on this, that when someone has a mind that is processing information in a non-traditional way that it is impossible to explain these processes to the rest of us. It is probably not possible to linearize and explain what is going on in his head. The word I'm struggling for is \\"ineffable\\". But what I also found thrilling and unique was to see the little flashes of the ordinary man underneath the ossified layers of \\"Bob-ness\\". I toally recommend this documentary to both the old hippies like myself, and as a study in something alien to the younger crowd.

B000AYEIZY|5.0|Cream was the first supergroup. They only existed for a few years in the late 1960s and released three albums. ItÕs one of those bands, like Joy Division, who made their mark, and didnÕt leave behind some dodgy albums. There are not many weak tracks in their resume. My dad used to have a couple of these album lying around, and it was always one record I like to put on as a kid. They havenÕt played in more than twenty years. They got together for four nights in 2005. This is the result. Most of this album focuses on the heavy blues, and less on the singles. \\"Spoonful\\" and \\"Sleepy Time Time\\" are some of their earliest songs, written by Willie Dixon and Muddy Waters, and the band, which ended up on their first album Fresh Cream (1966). They toured for a while and wrote a lot of songs on the road. Their best album, Disraeli Gears (1967), was recorded in New York City with Tom Dowd. This album had the great songs \\"Strange Brew,\\" and \\"Sunshine Of Your Love,\\" and \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses.\\" Only \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" is included here, at the end. There is a focus on the real music. Back in the day, Cream would play long jamming sets to stoned hippies. I liked some of the later stuff like \\"Badge\\" and \\"Politician.\\" Other stuff by Robert Johnson and Booker T. Jones and T-Bone Walker is cool. This is a great live album.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Violator will always be a though act to follow. Having said that, this album is very good still.  \\"Precious\\" is very nice!!! For those \\"little 15\\" fans it could definitely use more of Dave Gahan's deep voice/style. The background sounds are true to DM (very nice sampling!). Love the lyrics (as always with DM). See you at the concert.
B000B19BCG|5.0|Britpop has just celebrated its tenth anniversary recently. Supergrass was definitely one of the main early forces. Britpop has grown in popularity around the world. Some new bands like Kaiser Chiefs seem like a parody of Britpop. While Supergrass could probably enjoy the spoils of this refried Britpop they have moved on. Supergrass has grown beards and put out a ten year retrospective. Some of their previous albums have been eclectic affairs influenced by various British sounds and glam rock. Like BRMC they now decided to change the playing field a little bit. This record wasnÕt even recorded in Britain. They moved to France and soaked up the vibe. ItÕs a mellow and acoustic affair. They still have great songs like &Ograve;St. Petersburg&Oacute; which is a little folky and a little like Neil Young. Films inspire some of the songs. A few sound like music soundtracks. ItÕs a wonderful trip in a new land. They have shown that the home of Britpop is not there: it's been blown to shreds. It's a short direct record that gets to the point. ItÕs the bare bones.
0399152717|2.0|I've been reading Clive Cussler books for almost 30 years and like him enough that I actually drove several hundred miles to attend a book signing he had once.  His Dirk Pitt adventures have provided me with many hours of reading fun as I have many of these books 3 or 4 times over the years.  Plus, his loyalty to his fans is legendary. <br /> <br />But after reading \\"Polar Shift\\", the sixth in the Kurt Austin NUMA Files series, I think Clive has spread himself way too thin with 3 different series (the Pitt series, the Austin series and the woefully poor Oregon series).  I know that Clive doesn't write the Austin books (co-author Paul Kemprecos handles that chore), but he no doubt has final sign-off on the finished product and it disappoints me that he continues to greenlight these subpar efforts.  \\"Polar Shift\\" just has no excitement, bland over-the-top villians, government officials who won't listen to Austin (again) despite the fact that he has saved the world's bacon five previous times and, in the case of this novel, the event that puts the world in peril is a modified version of the event that put the world in peril in the Dirk Pitt novel \\"Shock Wave\\".  I made it through it, but it was a tough read, as have been all the Austin books for me.  I don't know if it is Kemprecos' style, the plots, or the fact that I can't help substituting Pitt for Austin, but these books just don't do it for me anymore (I don't think they ever did).  But, as I have a large collection of Cussler hardbacks, I'll probably continue to buy any future Austin books and that's probably what the publisher is counting on.  I just probably won't spend any time reading it. <br /> <br />If you are a newcomer to Cussler, read the Dirk Pitt series, preferably in order.  When you are done and crave more, go back and read them again because the other series just won't do it for you.  Sorry, Clive.
B00005UKE0|5.0|The Quiet One collides with the Wall of Sound, and the result is one of the most distinctive, coherent and deeply moving pop albums of the 20th century. <br /> <br />\\"What Is Life\\" alone is worth the price. What a beautiful lyric! What a killer riff! What an awesome production! And that's just ONE of the terrific tracks. <br /> <br />I haven't stopped marvelling at this set for thirty-five years, and hope to enjoy it for another thirty-five.
1401200605|3.0|I'm a Batman fan, hands down. It's all ways been about the Dark Knight, more so than the Boy In Blue and all of DC's other characters. Batman has always been top of the line for me. I may not collect the monthlies but many of my favorite comics are Batman comics: Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One, The Killing Joke, Gotham by Gaslight, to name a few.<br /><br />When I heard that Lee was going to be joining the Batman team, I was pretty excited. I checked out the issues as they came in. Never buying, but looking them over. One of my favorite images of Batman was this drawing that Lee did for Batman Black and White many years ago. I was excited to think of what he might do with a whole comic let alone a few issues.<br /><br />Now that I've seen the final product, I guess I feel a little let down. Maybe I'm preferential to other artists like Miller, Breyfogle, Wagner, and others who portray him as a creature of the shadows and not a hulking brute who just beats the crap out of everything he comes across. Right from the get go, we're getting a Batman who looks more like Spartan from Wildcats with a cape. I did like his work on Killer Croc and Catwoman. All complaints aside, Jim Lee can draw women better than anyone out there save John Cassaday.<br /><br />I guess, what I was hoping for was Jim to mess with his usual style and maybe try some of the stuff he used to do with Deathblow and come up with more darkness than was used. Although, he seems to do that a little more in the second Volume of Hush, I just wasn't feeling that his art style was the best for Batman.<br /><br />As for Loeb's writing, it's really good. The story kind of goes from plot point to plot point and it's kind of like a who's who in the Batman Rogues Gallery. The Catwoman/Batman twist makes for good reading but sometimes his narrative seemed forced and not needed. We see his Batline get cut but do we need to be told \\"Someone cut my Batline!\\" I don't think so.<br /><br />Good start. Volume Two is much better.me Two is much better.
B00097A5HW|1.0|I wanted to like this CD but it did not impress me at all. I love La Tortura but the rest of the CD is not inspiring at all.
B00005U152|5.0|The other versions are excellent as well, including Lon Chaney's silent epic; Charles Laughton saving Maureen O'Hara from burning Hollywood; and Demi Moore in her greatest performance in the Disney musical.  But for my money, this is the version to buy and cherish.  Filmed in France for Frenchmen, and secondarily for the international market, HUNCHBACK was criticized at home for failure to cast French actors in either of the leading roles.  It's not as if France in 1956-7 didn't have dozens of great stars, and wouldn't you have enjoyed seeing a version of this Victor Hugo tale with, say, Jean Gabin as Quasimodo, and Brigitte Bardot as Esmeralda?  Instead the producers went elsewhere, arguing that in the novel, of course, Esmeralda's \\"foreignness\\" was an essential part of the tale, and the same for Quasimodo.  Gabin was, indeed, a very real possibility, for he was director Jean Delannoy's Inspector Maigret in several films and the two clicked together on a personal level as well.<br /><br />Thus we have Anthony Quinn as the tortured church servant, and Gina Lollobrigida as Esmeralda.  She plays up the Gypsy aspect quite a bit, and in general cavorts like she's Demi Moore trying to have a good time, but something of her fate seems to be hanging over her handsome, tousled head, and the shadow of the gargoyles is like the guillotine--a factor of doom.  Lollobrigida had just finished filming TRAPEZE and was given only four days' holiday before reporting to Paris for the arduous, twelve-week NOTRE DAME DE PARIS shoot.  (Notice how buff her arms are in those sleeveless peasant blouses, that's a holdover from her training for TRAPEZE.)<br /><br />Lovers of French film will rejoice to see Roger Blin in s smallish part: Blin starred in everything from Cocteau's ORPHEUS to Clouzot's LE CORBEAU, and in NOTRE DAME DE PARIS he's very stylish, though badly dubbed into English.<br /><br />Best of all is the lustrous color photography!  Because this was a production partially financed by the French government, approved by Minister of Culture Andre Malraux, the production was allowed to film directly in the Cathedral itself, so every time you see an interior shot, or so it is said, you are peering into the mysterious Notre Dame itself.  The long shots of Quasimodo pouring molten oil over the battlements were recreated largely in the studio.  Watch for the famous bateaux-mouches parading lazily up the Seine, which has never looked more beuatiful.  This film was nominated for a \\"Cesar,\\" the Oscar of France, but somehow lost to a smaller product.  The day of the \\"new wave\\" was at hand and it wouldn't be long before the names of the moment would be Louis Malle, Jean-Luc Godard, Agnes Varda, Chris Marker, and Francois Truffaut.  When the bells ring in the ancient cathedral, they're ringing out the end of an era, and ringing in a new dawn for French film.financed by the French government, approved by Minister of Culture Andre Malraux, the production was allowed to film directly in the Cathedral itself, so every time you see an interior shot, or so it is said, you are peering into the mysterious Notre Dame itself.

0802130208|4.0|Taste and decency! Theology and geometry! Lashed until she drops! If nothing else, Ignatius J. Reilly's catchphrases are the one thing you will take away from this book. Reilly is one of the funniest characters in literature: pompous, obese, unabashedly selfish, a little crazy, and with a style of speaking and writing that is surely unique.  His letter to Mr. Abelman still makes me laugh when I think about it. <br /> <br />The book is not great though. Apart from the terrific Ignatius Reilly, few of the characters work. Many pages are wasted on Mrs. Levy and Miss Trixie, their annoying scenes about as funny as a punch in the solar plexus, although I did like Miss Trixie's gait explained mathematically. The Darlene-bird and Mancuso-costume slapstick routines may be funny for their time, but do not work now. And despite what Walker Percy says in his foreword, the Burma Jones character is a cliche and a caricature. The sob-story about Reilly's dog was unnecessary -- there is no cause for sentimentality in a work of such nature -- and if Toole was alive when the book was published, they would have certainly excised that part. <br /> <br />But Reilly does work, and he works so spectacularly that this book is a must read for this one character alone. And how many books can you say that about?

B00005RHGK|3.0|I just don't get the cover of this movie at all. What's with the big eye?<br /><br />But minor quibble over, the movie was great, and better than I expected after being told that it wasn't that great, the second one was better etc. But I had to see the first one to understand the second one apparently.<br /><br />This is definitely one of those horror movies, where I was actually rooting for one of the leads to die. I found the two leads the most annoying characters ever, even though the girl had gorgeous hair. They were so irritating. Of course you don't go back to the site of a place where you may or may not have seen a possible murder. You keep driving. For god sake.<br /><br />As in all good horror movies, the leads didn't get to meet the actual actor who was playing the Creeper, to give a better reaction on film. I wasn't really sure about the Creeper though. I didn't find him that scary. The things he did, yes, but not him. You don't really see him that much, compared to some other horror movies. It was brief glimpses at most.<br /><br />I'm definitely looking forward to the second Jeepers Creepers, as I've seen the trailer for that and it looked very interesting.

B0000011P7|3.0|Walk into light is technically Ian Anderson's first solo LP.  \\"A\\" was actually his first and later became a Jethro Tull recording.  Walk into Light shows Anderson in what I call his \\"Synthesizer era.\\" Anderson at the time was looking for another direction that he had started with \\"Under Wraps\\".  At that time I guess he had tired of acoustic music and mandolins and was trying to re-invent himself.  The good news is that \\"Fly by Night\\" is probably among my all-time favorite songs by Ian Anderson, which would include the Jethro Tull catalog. Fly  by night alone to me would justify buying the CD. Trains is another song of note. He talks about how he spends his life on trains.  Made in England is a worthy effort as well, but with each song the album becomes progressively boring. Dont compare this recording to a Jethro Tul recording, take it at face value and maybe you wont be as disappointed as I was. Over the years some of the songs have grown on me though.   This CD would be for Tull/Anderson collectors.  I an not saying dont get it, but I am not recommending it either.
0060589280|3.0|What is sex? This is what Coelho seems to be asking, and ultimately answering (not to my satisfaction, though) in this unlikely novel. In his characteristic fairy-tale style,(a story-teller who seems a bit detached) he tackles the mind of a prostitute, and we follow her progression from pretty and naive teenager in rural Brazil, through the big city and on through to Switzerland where she eventually becomes a prostitute, but one who apparently doesn't quite get what sex is all about, that is, she doesn't reach orgasm.     To Coelho orgasm and the joy of sex apparently are the gates to the uyltimate symbolic union with the Divine. As a man, he seems to be exploring a woman's sexuality and the connection to spirituality.     I didn't get the connection, and feel that his other novel \\"The Alchemist\\" is a better book, which does lead us to existential exploration of our perennial quest for self.    For those who want a good read with serious metaphysical explorations, read \\"The Alchemist\\". Also read Grigor Fedan's \\"Dream Maker:A Mystical Tale\\". Both novels are excellent in their own right. The first is a parable of life, the second  tackles the \\"big questions\\" and is a true story of reincarnation.
1402568851|5.0|I got this book (...) The reading was superb, especially recommended listening for someone who doesn't like audiobooks, or thinks they don't.    I don't think that this is so much about autism as about people who see the world in a simpler way than the rest of us do. I have known one supposed autistic who could't talk and certainly didn't resemble this character. Some would say that she had a more severe case of autism, but I think that autism is a misleading characterization and that many conditions that are unrelated are linked together under that label.    This is not an alien character, but a sympathetic one. There are parts that made me cry. At the same time, the narrator also has a sense of humor, somewhat unwitting, for example as he describes how metaphors are lies -- quite amusing.
B0000A118M|5.0|Arguably the best album John Coltrane ever recorded and consistently mentioned as the greatest album in jazz, \\"A Love Supreme\\" lives up to everything that it is discussed as. <br /> <br />Coltrane was riding an artistic high-- enormously successful thanks to 1960's \\"My Favorite Things\\", he had quite a bit more latitude than many musicians, a producer who would support his every experiment in Bob Thiele, and a band willing to go wherever he needed (pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones) who he'd developed a rapport with over three years of constantly working together.  He'd just recorded the stunning \\"Crescent\\" several months earlier and entered the studio in December to record this suite. <br /> <br />The piece, as indicated by the liner notes Coltrane penned, is spiritually informed, a prayer offered to God.  The music itself is based on relatively traditional structures, but Coltrane manages to juggle a number of influences and sounds-- shades of Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler all run through it.  The suite is broken in four movements-- \\"Acknowledgement\\" is patient and building, revolving around a four-note bass motif-- Trane is exploratory and yearning.  After a brief bass solo, this moves into the frantic \\"Resolution\\", where Coltrane rails against his theme, turns things over to a oddly meditative yet equally frantic Tyner, and then solos himself in Monkish fashion-- extrapolating off his theme and exploring the sort of spiritual ecstacy that he heard in Ayler.  A brief drum solo signals the transition to \\"Pursuance\\"-- Jones is full of energy and explosiveness and this sustains throughout the piece, Coltrane's extended solo is nothing short of stunning, full of fire and energy before suddenly taming down and surrendering to Jones briefly then an astonishing solo by Garrison.  Finally, the long exhale after the tension-- \\"Psalm\\", finds Coltrane meditative, almost wistful, and informed with a sense of optimistic melancholy. <br /> <br />When it's all done, it's an experience.  Many listeners find this the first truly unlistenable Coltrane album-- too much for its own good, but it certainly leaves its mark.  My assessment is that the album is nothing short of stunning.
B000003N8R|4.0|An album often forgotten in light of its followup, \\"Crescent\\" is to my mind the first fully realized album by John Coltrane-- his earlier work had a searching quality, this one feels like he's found something, and while it may only be a stepping stone on the way to even bigger things, this feeling of unity on the record makes the album emminently listenable. <br /> <br />Recorded in mid-1964 by his then-working quartet (Coltrane heard exclusively at this point on tenor with pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones), this is an album where two things are clear-- first that the quartet had acheived a near psychic level of interaction and second that Coltrane had evolved his music into a form that would allow him to push his soul straight through his horn. <br /> <br />The music has a spiritual quality to it that's unmistakable that informs the entire record-- if \\"A Love Supreme\\" was a prayer, this is a meditation.  Opener and title track \\"Crescent\\" probably best illustrates this-- Trane is patient, letting the theme gently simmer before allowing the rhythm section to set the tempo slightly higher during his improvisation-- this form allowed the theme to have a meditative quality to it without restricting the improvisation to ballad structures.  More to the point, while the theme statement is somewhat moody, the improvisation takes an ecstatic quality to it, a spiritual energy. <br /> <br />But if ecstatic energy informs the title track, then a pair of pieces maintain a bluer mood-- \\"Wise One\\", inspired by Coltrane's first wife, Naima, and \\"Lonnie's Lament\\".  The former is delicate and lovely but with an unusual hint of melancholy, particularly in Trane's soloing (I've often wondered, given that Coltrane had recently met Alice Macleod who was destined to be his second wife, if this was the source of this moodiness), the latter is downright bleak, with a superb, lilting piano solo and an even better bass solo. <br /> <br />The album is rounded out by a pair of curiosities-- \\"Bessie's Blues\\" and \\"The Drum Thing\\".  The former is a positively ecstatic blues, a fine performance in its won right, but totally out of place on the record.  On the other hand, Tyner is a monster, soloing in and around the theme in Monkish fashion brilliantly.  The latter is (as one would guess) an extended drum feature for the genius of Elvin Jones.  It serves as a fine coda for the album and Jones is nothing short of brilliant. <br /> <br />While Coltrane would easily trump this record several months later in recording his suite \\"A Love Supreme\\", \\"Crescent\\" stands well in its own right.  Perhaps it's not quite the masterpiece its followup is, but it certainly is a great record.  Recommended.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|I wish I could give half stars in Amazon because this CD deserves 2 1/2, not 2 or 3.  It is not as bad as some others have reviewed, but true fans of Enigma will be disappointed.  It is perfectly \\"middle of the road\\".  Not awful, but nothing to remember. <br /> <br />While I do not agree with their conclusions, I do believe the reviews from Chrysanfori, MoonGoddess, Mars Velvet are the best I have seen.  I cannot add anymore details about the individual tracks than they have, so I will not try.  I will simply give my opinion of the album from the perspective of a long time fan of Enigma. <br /> <br />I have always been attracted to Enigma's music because of its innovativeness.   1990 and Cross of Changes were truly different from anything the music industry has ever produced.  3 was very good too.  Even today, no one has been able to mimic that sound.  That innovativeness is gone in Voyaguer.  You could hear it waning in Screen Behind the Mirror, but it is completely gone in Voyaguer.  If you played random samples from 5 different ambient albums you would not be able to tell which came from Voyaguer.  It is very cookie cutter stuff.  I have all of the Enigma albums on my iPod and often listen to Voyaguer and then immediately switch over to Cross of Changes, 1990, and 3 and am just shocked at the difference.  It is like the albums are not even from the same group.  I was a sophomore in high school when 1990 was released.  In an age of Nirvana and Motley Crue, the buzz of my school was Sadness Part 2 from the 1990 album.  It was so different, so unlike anything anyone had ever heard before or since.  Its uniqueness was so special and so powerful.  Truly different in a world of \\"Me Too\\" Pearl Jam knock off's.  Unfortunately, that distinctive Enigma sound is no more. <br /> <br />In addition, I have always loved that Enigma's albums were more \\"musical journeys\\" than a loose grouping of songs from the same artist like most albums.  This album is more of a collection of disjointed ambient tracks without any common theme or purpose.  The first 3 albums are very heavy, involving.  I would almost say addictive.  The music and the theme pull you in.  I can't listen to individual tracks from the first three CDs, I just play the first \\"song\\" and listen all the way through.  Voyaguer is very different.  Since there is no common theme, it is easy to skip around and listen to one song or another without listening to the whole album.   <br /> <br />In short, this CD is not a dog by any means.  It is not awful.  It is, however, very Plain Jane.  Nothing new and nothing to remember.  If you like ambient music, you will probably like this album.  If you are looking for Enigma, you will not find it here. <br />

0679422714|5.0|The truth is, this isn't exactly a quick read.  I picked it up on a trip through London and have finally put it down a month later.  However, if you're willing to deal with the density it is an utterly absorbing book.  The reason for the density is obvious.  There is no doubt, from the opening pages, that this is not so much a biography, as a case being carefully built to crack the myth of Mao.  Early on, there is an extraordinary letter, written by Mao as a young man which serves as a keen insight to every decision made from thereon.  It's a call to power, a chilling dismissal of individual rights and a note to himself that his 'morality' is different to that that the rest of mankind chooses to follow.  What you have then, is a well written portrait of a man who didn't stand and act on behalf of the people, but who looked at the large picture, took calculated risks and saw how 'the people' could be manipulated to serve his own purposes.  It's a book making a serious, strong case against one of the twentieth century's most intriguing figures.  It succeeds on drawing out the man from beneath the smiling propoganda pictures.  The truth is, the more flesh and blood Mao is revealed to be, the colder the reader's heart turns against him.  A comprehensive (if heavy) achievement.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|As I read these reviews, I am perplexed by the people who complain that Batman Begins is inconsistent with the original source material, meaning the first Tim Burton film. As if Tim Burton invented Batman and his version is the one to respect. <br />The Burton film was rife with inconsistencies in relation to the true origin of Batman. The Joker did not kill Bruce Wayne's parents. Commissioner Gordon did play a crucial role in Batman's development. <br />Batman Begins is the truest version of the Batman legend and is not meant to be considered as a part of the previous films canon. It is the beginning of a whole new telling of the story.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I knew they had the good dance music, that endeared them to a generation, in them. Well this is it! \\"Precious\\" & \\"Lilian\\" are sure to reestablish them as dance standards. There are some slow parts here, yet the band always had this type of songs on their albums. \\"Nothings Impossible\\" is catchy and relevant to to many who are looking to find love again. \\"Damaged People\\" is the theme for a generation who find solace in these great tunes! <br /> <br />I am very satisfied with the end results of this work. Exciter had a few moments of clarity. Ultra was music to sleep to. Angel on the other hand is a return to the glory days of Violator. I feel like getting out my old dancing shoes and going back to the dance floor. This is not a comeback, more of a revival of a classic sound!
B00006ADGP|5.0|This film released in 1977,  directed by Ettore Scola and starring Sophia Loren (Antonietta) and Marcello Mastroianni (Gabriele) was ahead of its time in its sensitive handling of homosexuality. The events take place during the space of one day, a \\"special day,\\" when Hitler and Mussolini have a huge rally in Rome. Practically the entire city turns out for the event. While Antonietta's boorish husband and their six children-- he's anxious to have a seventh child-- go to the event, she stays home and meets a neighbor (Gabriele) when her parrot escapes from her window and lights on a ledge outside Gabriele's apartment. What follows is a beautiful story of two very different people whose lives touch each other briefly, and both of them are the better for it. The gentle Gabriele is totally different from and in stark contrast to Antonietta's brutish, selfish husband who is also a \\"father\\" and a \\"soldier.\\" Of course Gabriele is none of these but rather a quiet, sensitive soul who reads and lives in a neat, tastefully furnished apartment.<br /><br />Juxtaposed with the beautiful encounter of these two individuals is the constant martial music and speeches that are broadcast all over the City of Rome glorifying these two dictators. The film is ultimately optimistic-- at least mildly-- however, as Gabriele says that \\"life is worth living.\\"<br /><br />Loren and Mastroianni, both attractive and fine actors, give the kinds of performances we expect from them. Even as a tired housewife who wears Eleanor Roosevelt shoes, Ms. Loren is still incomparably beautiful.

Anthony looks weird, his voice is, to say the best, unusual, but the song was unique and interesting.  So today, I haul myself to MediaPlay, and buy the CD, slip it into the car's CD player, and my first reaction is \\"What the ........ did I just waste $14 on??!!\\" Given the other reviews, I am hoping with more plays, it will \\"grow on me\\", but I doubt it.  I am not sure I can survive another listening.  I gave it another listen (and another), and this is the worst CD I HAVE EVER bought.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|I've always been a casual Batman fan at best.  I liked the 60's TV show and the later films, but found the first two way too dark for my tastes.  I had little desire to see this film until friends and family started raving about it.  I decided to give it a try.  Am I ever glad I did.<br /><br />Ignoring all previous movie and TV series, this movie begins with a Bruce Wayne unsure what to do with his life.  Through flashbacks, we see his tragic childhood including his parent's murder.  Back in the present, Bruce begins a quest to deal with his inner demons.  Ultimate, it leads him to return to Gotham City in his dual roll.  And it's just in time.  Corruption and crime have overtaken the city, with the Scarecrow leading the pack.  Can this rookie vigilante deal with the menace?<br /><br />I think what impressed me with the movie was the back story.  For once I finally understood why a millionaire would risk life and limb like Bruce does on a regular basis.  For a superhero movie, the story is slow, especially in the set up.  But it really feels more like a drama then a superhero movie, so it really works well.  And there are plenty of action scenes, not to mention a climax that is intense enough to make up for the earlier aspects of the movie.<br /><br />Ultimately, I walked away from this film feeling very satisfied.  This is a movie everyone can enjoy whether they are a die hard Batman fan or not.

0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi is totally unlike anything I have ever read. The protagonist is an intelligent and resourceful young lad whose sincerity and earnestness make the reader root for his survival. It doesn't matter to Pi or to the reader that his story turns out to be unacceptable to people \\"in charge.\\" What matters is that Pi's inner beauty shines through the clouds of disaster that envelop him throughout the crossing.
B000055Y0X|4.0|For about a week, my English class has viewed Dr. Strangelove (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.) Most people have heard of Dr. Strangelove- It's considered a classic. But is it really a classic, or overrated? <br /> <br />The plot is centered around the U.S. in the Cold War, at Burpleson air force base (where General Ripper and Captain Mandrake [played by Peter Sellers] are), the War Room (where the president [played by Peter Sellers], General Turgidson, and Dr. Strangelove [ALSO played by Peter Sellers] himself are), and Major Kong and his crew on the plane with a bomb. General Ripper at the Base, who is INSANE, sends the plane to bomb 'the Commies' ..and only he knows the Code to stop it. The Code is a three letter combination.. but it would take too long to guess. The code is later figured out by Captain Mandrake, but some more trouble is headed their way.. the plane is damaged and can't get incoming messages... including the Code. Major Kong and his crew spend most of the movie playing the 'Hero' and trying to take out orders and bomb the Commies..although we know it is very much the opposite. Dr. Strangelove informs the president and his 'people' in the War Room that because of a \\"Doomsday Device\\", if one bomb goes of, it will be the end of the world. The movie is a huge satire with them dealing with this dilemma. It's funny but it makes you realize how stupid the characters are. <br /> <br />One scene that stands out is where the president says: \\"Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room.\\" I knew about this line before even seeing the movie. It's pretty well known. Another scene you may know is at Burpleson Air force base, the soldiers are shooting at each other right under the sign for the base that says \\"Peace is our profession.\\" <br /> <br />If you're wondering whether or not to see this movie, I'd say rent it first. The writing is Genius - it's cleverly worded and witty. But not everyone will get the humor. It isn't flatout. You have to think about it and look at detail to see the humor, because it's subtle. If you're into really slap-stick comedy, this isn't what you're looking for. I'd say Dr. Strangelove would appeal to an older audience. <br />
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This movie is so great! I love musicals and I could'nt stop singing  the songs all day long! Fantastic Movie and Musical!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0156027321|4.0|i would have to say i thought Life of Pi was an amazing book. The end came as a surprise to me, but a good surprise. I learned a lot from this book. It taught me that telling life stories as an adventure is always a lot more entertaining most of the time. Hearing stories that are always realistic and boring may not be as fulfilling as hearing a story with a little imagination to it. Pi's story was thrilling and can easily make one believe in God. Pi's faith throughout the novel was interesting to read about because it constantly got stronger and stronger. This story has a powerful message of faith and imagination that teaches the reader a lot!
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Even though Batman Begins is the best Batman film yet, Batman {1989} is still a great film and a masterpiece. I love how they worked on the new Batman 2-disc DVD. The new transfer rocks and the really did a great job remastering the footage.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's performance as The Joker hasn't changed a bit. In fact, everytime I watch this film and see his performance as The Joker, I just get excited. Even though Christian Bale took the title from Michael Keaton as the best Batman/Bruce Wayne, Keaton still is a excellent Batman.<br /><br />I love the new features in this DVD, like Shadow Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight 1-3, Batman: The Complete Robin Storyboards Sequence, Legends Of The Dark Knight: The History Of Batman and more.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Batman {1989}, get this DVD. Also, get Batman Returns.
B000002W9Q|5.0|What a blast to re-live those heady days -- Patrick Swayze is magnificent and there's a decent storyline, so enjoying the music goes without saying.  Very happy to have this CD.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Batman {1989} is a excellent film, but was the sequel gonna be just as great?...HELL YEAH! Batman Returns is a excellent sequel, and that's rare to see with sequels to films based on comic books {like the junky The Crow: City Of Angels}.  <br /> <br />I love how Tim Burton changed the Penquin character {who is played by Danny DeVito}, that he was rejected by his parents when he was an infant and lived in the sewers ever since with a group of Penguins. Now, after 33 years later, he finally wants to head up into the surface. But, to do that, he needs help from Max Shreck {Walken}, who I think is the real villian in this movie. Max Shreck is so evil, he kills his employees if they knew too much, like Selina Kyle {Pfeiffer} who knew about Shreck's plan and was pushed threw a window and left for dead. Too bad Shreck doesn't know about her 9 lives and now she becomes Catwoman. <br /> <br />Michael Keaton does another great performance as Batman in this excellent sequel. This film is more darker than the first part and I can see why Tim Burton liked doing this film a lot more than the first one.  <br /> <br />Fans will love this 2-disc DVD with a great transfer of sound and picture. Great features like Shadow Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight 4, The Bat, The Cat and The Penquin and the Face To Fce Music Video By Siouxie And The Banshees. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Batman Returns, get this 2-disc DVD.  <br /> <br />
0553804367|5.0|This book takes on a nearly impossible task: explaining some of the most challenging questions facing theoretical physics--not to mention philosophers and theologians--today in a manner that everyone can understand.  I'll admit that as a \\"non-science\\" type, some of this book went over my head.  But it wasn't due to a lack of effort by the authors to keep things clear.  In fact, the concepts that I found most difficult to follow were the most recent, least developed theories<br /><br />What I found most interesting about this book is that it leaves you thinking about how small a part of this universe we are and how improbable our existence is.  This book inspires many more questions about our universe than it tries to answer.  This is a great book to read and discuss with others as a result.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|When Joel Schumacher destroyed the other Batman series, the best thing to do is start over aagain and make it better. Batman Begins is definitley the best Batman film, the best film of the year and it's definitley a masterpiece.     After being the Batman champion for 16 years, Christian Bale has took that title away from Michael Keaton. Don't get me wrong, Michael Keaton is still a great Batman, but Bale was a greater Batman and a greater Bruce Wayne.    I love how the film starts where Bruce Wayne {Bale} meets a man name Ducard {Neeson}who will teach him to become a warrior. I also like how they show his past, where he finds the batcave that's under Wayne Manor, how his parents were murdered and the pain it's causing him. It's very close to the comic, only difference is that he never had a childhood friend name Rachael.    Anyway, after he is trained by Ducard, Ra's Al Ghul {Watanabe} wanted Bruce to kill a man, but Bruce refuses. And now, a feud starts and Bruce leaves and heads back to Gotham City. Only to see that crime is getting bigger.    One thing I love about this film is that it shows a very good relationship between Bruce and Alfred {Caine}, like it shows how much of a father figure he is. Also, the relationship between Batman and Jim Gordan {Oldman}, which you really didn't see in the other Batman films. How Lucius Fox {Freeman} shows him all the new technology he needs to become Batman. Cillian Murphy brings out a brilliant performance as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow and Katie Holmes was a good additional character to this film.    Some people say that this film is too talky. It's called Batman Begins, you're not gonna see any action until you see how it all began.     This 2-disc DVD edition with cool features is perfect for all Batman fans. It's definitley worth every penny and you won't be disappointent.
B0000028RR|5.0|this is a rare album. it isn't often i hear such a great record. rage against the machine was a ground breaking band that changed the world and music forever. now, five years after \\"renegades\\" their music is still fresh, and is still heard by many. if there is one record i recommend ABOVE ALL it would be this one, and RATM's other records. they are truly one of the greatest bands to ever live. their message was in every song. they had several messages, from the government and the things we can do to change things to the unjust trial of abu Jamal. this is truly a band that deserves a fresh listen. may the legacy of rage against the machine live on.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|When Depeche Mode dissapeared in the 90s I feared they would never release a new album and I think I can all say we were all blown away by Ultra, which many consider to be DM's top 3 albums of all time easily.<br /><br />Then I questioned DM's ability to survive after I heard the mixed bag that was known as Exciter, it was DM, but it was a bit too dancy.<br /><br />Then David Gahan releases his solo album and I truly feared DM might stop playing as a band.<br /><br />Well true synthpop fans rejoice, everything you liked about Ultra is back again, 'Playing the Angel' is a very mature and complex album. The beats are interesting and the singing is rich, if you like DM at all, this is an album to buy. Every song is really good (no particular song is their best ever, but they're all really good!). The synth work can be very dark and slow and sometimes touches on the complex styles of IDM (without the dancy aspects).
0385512058|5.0|Finally here's a book that does more than just tell us it's important to network. Keith does networking wonderfully without looking too obnoxious while doing it. This book is a must read for everyone, whatever point you are at in your career.
B000002GXS|5.0|I LOVE this album.  The whole collection is great.  My personal favorites are \\"Fumblin' With the Blues\\", \\"Shiver Me Timbers\\", and \\"Please Call Me, Baby.\\"  I've been listening to this since the 70's, and it still blows me away.
B0000004V2|5.0|If anything, The Stone Roses sound fantastic on this album. Their music is sheer quality, and im not using that as a cliche. It is. From the start, you are treated to \\"I wanna be adored\\", which is probably one of the best openings to an album ever. Throughout the album, you are aurally soothed by Brown's vocals, Squire's wiry riffs, Mani's effective bass and Reni's Orgasmic drum beats. This album is the rawest Brit-Rock album on the shelves, so get it!
B000002NC4|5.0|This album was the first Built To Spill album I bought, and it's still the best after all this time.  What's great about this album, moreso than the other Built To Spill albums, the thing they do differently on this one, is consistently branch out and extend songs and song structure.  There is a pop/rock (radio playability?) sensibility to all of Built To Spill's music, I think.  On this album especially, they take that sound and transform something that's very listenable and easy to appreciate into something that reveals its complexity more and more each time.  It's not just fun to listen to, the more you listen to it the more you appreciate the inspired arrangements and lyrics. <br /> <br />Really, I like all the songs on this album, from start to finish, and I can't pick out a single moment that this album lulls or fails for me.  \\"Randy Described Eternity\\" a mellow space jam that speaks about (you guessed it) eternity with a great analogy to time and infinity.  Really smart stuff so far.  Also outstanding is \\"Stop The Show\\" a song that transforms from a slow jam in the first half to a bouncy rocker with angular guitar chops in the second half, with a nice \\"chugging train\\" transition between the halves.  A third favorite of mine on this album is \\"Kicked It in the Sun,\\" again, like two songs stuck together in an extended structure that really works.  <br /> <br />What stands out for me the most is that on each and every song, there is a guitar bit that I remember, that etches itself into my mind, and I really anticipate hearing those little bits during each song, which I think is a sign of strong craft.  Also, each and every song has a lyric that burns itself into my memory, showing me a new way to look at the things around me.  This album succeeds as entertainment, to be sure, but also as art.   <br /> <br />As for the actual sound, I don't know how to describe it, I think Doug Martsch seems informed by a number of classic rock styles, he's definitely got the sameflair for layering guitars that Jimmy Page had, he's got a kind of Verlaine-esque intellect about his solos, and a definite contemporary indie-rock sensibility, maybe rooted in the Pixies.  I can tell you, however, that I like Pavement, Sonic Youth, Modest Mouse, and some others that have been compared to Built To Spill, and while I don't find a lot of similarities in sound, I would think that fans of the aforementioned bands would really enjoy Built To Spill in general, and this album especially.
B00009V7OL|1.0|First off, I love the movie, and I would normally give it 4 out of 5 stars.  The problem I am having is that the picture appears as if it were on a standard 4:3 television.  I have a widescreen TV, and the image is \\"squished\\" with double black bars.  I set my DVD player for a widescreen display, and the aspect ratio is still wrong.  I am having this problem with the two-disc DVD that came out some years ago now.  Not the newly released two disc set with the white box.  Another reviewer as reported the same problem. <br /> <br />I don't know if they have remedied the problem with the newer DVD or not, but I would not recomend this version for owners of widescreen TV's.  This mars an otherwise fantastic movie.
0307276902|5.0|This mans story is harsh truth and not for the squeemish.  A Brutally honest story with many interesting life lessons.....  Taking responsiblility for your own choices in life, the phsychology of addiction, a little bit of a love story, how communication and vulnerability bonds life long friendships, and most of all, how sometimes it is not our place to judge others...especially when you don't know their full stories.
B000002B5L|1.0|I disagee with those who said that Lauren was the best Fugee. Wyclef is the man. Lauren has issues and is still working on them. Wyclef is so talented. The Score did not impress me as much as the Carnival and Ecleftic. Miseducation was great but it was nothing like Lauren's real style. So I still give it to Wyclef for keeping it real.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I was worried that they would change their style or worse yet, not change it but end up stale.  Neither!  It is an excellent album :)
B0000AQS0F|1.0|The worst, cheesist show ever made. Weak characters and cheap special effects. It sucked all the way. The serious scenes were funny and funny scenes were children garbage.
B000005HN6|5.0|Opeth's debut album Orchid marked the beginning of this band's impressive journey into becoming one of the most promising metal bands of the 1990's! Their unique spin of progressive melodic death metal has earned them praise everywhere for good reasons!!! Like all other Opeth albums, one of the most important aspects is the unique blend of acoustic/electric guitars by guitarists Mikael Akerfeldt and Peter Lindgren. Orchid carries not only some of the most interesting guitar riffs of Opeth, but some of the best guitar riffs I've ever heard period. I cant see how one can deny the first few amazing riffs of In Mist She Was Standing or the beyond beautiful intro of Forest of October unless they are insistent on excessive palm muting and tremolo with more concerns of guitar speed than composition. What I appreciate most is that Opeth have their standard very heavy riffs and many outstanding progressive interlude riffs, which create an excellent atmosphere. Atmosphere is definitely something lacking in the music scene today. This album takes you through an epic journey that no other band could possibly replicate. <br /> <br />The acoustics tend to be a bit slower than later albums but I find it makes this album easily as good musically if not better. It sets an even more atmospheric setting that is enough to almost put one in completely tranquil state. As someone suggested earlier, this atmosphere can create quite a calm yet eerie setting. One other thing that I've noticed about the musicianship is that Orchid easily boasted one of their best rhythm line-ups with Anders Nordin on Drums and Johan de Farfalla on bass. The production isn't that great, but on a first album that is expected. The vast majority of vocals on this album are screamed/growled and Mikael's clean voice is great at this point but still developing. They would go on to expand his clean vocals on later albums. Despite the lack of clean vocals, the setting has made this one of their more beautifully dark albums. <br /> <br />The album starts with In Mist She Was Standing, which starts off with a couple of classic heavy, progressive Opeth guitar riffs and further develops with Mikael's aggressive vocals and acoustic atmosphere. Continues with more aggression, melodic beautiful guitar passages and acoustic beauty. In Mist She Was Standing is certainly one of Orchid's better tracks. Next is Under The Weeping Moon, not quite at the level of In Mist She Was Standing but a great song nonetheless. After the bass intro it has a great opening solo, follows with Opeth's usual brand of intensity and acoustic beauty. Give the long acoustic passages a chance to develop. You wont regret it! This brings us to Silhouette, an excellent piano interlude. Not too long, not repetitive and definitely performed by a skilled piano player and not worth skipping at all! That brings us to one of the most memorable Opeth openings in Forest of October! Its beyond me how people cannot appreciate the beautiful guitar introduction!!! Forest of October flows great after Silhouette. Forest of October is one of the best tracks on this album without a doubt. <br /> <br />Twilight Is My Robe is different because this song starts of with some hellacious growls and kick-your ass guitar riffs from the get go. Somewhat different in structure than some songs, still contains some really good melodic guitar harmonies and some of Mikael's more memorable acoustic passages and clean vocals. And the some decent bass work in the middle! : O Full marks! Requiem is their first acoustic interlude and although rather short, it's still a superb piece of acoustic material. Set the standard for future acoustic Opeth songs and is a great song to set up The Apostle in Triumph. The softest intro to any of their full songs on this album, two minutes of great acoustic patterns followed by a beautiful lead guitar melody that assures that the skip button is not needed! Opeth's least intense, most epic full song on this album andeasily a standout. Many of their best melodic (distorted) guitar harmonies are found on this track. Recommendations include In Mist She Was Standing, Forest of October, The Apostle in Triumph and the impressive piano melody Silhouette. For an opening album, this is outstanding work and definitely worthy of being an Opeth masterpiece. Couldn't ask for more but Opeth seemed insistent on giving us even more! Couldn't be happier!
B00005JO0J|1.0|Dont waste your money or your time. A total waste of time.The movie was the worst i ever seen in my life. The direction was the worst ever! The action made no sense what so ever. the visuals was like something out of a bad sci-fi channel production.
B00005JNSK|3.0|This movie doesn't compare to the original version.  If Tim Burton thought this was an improvement, he's probably certifiable.  The music doesn't hold the same charm, Johnny Depp is just strange in comparison to Wilder's genious, and though I like the Charlie character better than the original, he's really the best part about the movie.  Why he had all the oompa loompa be the same man, I don't know, but their songs are completely incoherent in which case defeats the purpose of their singing in the first place.   <br /> <br />So since they don't compare, let's not compare them and accept this for what it is, a decent children's movie with a good moral to it.  The importance of family.  The original is a charming classic that will last for ever.  The new one is acceptable.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|With the departure of Alan after SOFAD, Ultra was shockingly amazing.  Exciter was the biggest let down and the weakest DM album of all time.  I now have to laugh when thinking that Andy said it was the best since Black Celebration.  In fact, Andy now jokes that PTA is the best since Speak & Spell--which I thought was a pretty good recovery from previous hyperbole.  But Exciter struggled to produce a decent track amongst the lot.  I can still hear the ghost of Alan Wilder saying \\"it needs more layering.\\"      Playing The Angel (PTA) is well done.  The songs are as dark or darker than Black Celebration.  The songs (especially the opening track \\"A Pain that I'm Used to\\") also have an edgy quality like I Feel You and Barrel of A Gun but with more synth layering.  The Analogue Synths feel very Music for the Masses/Violator-like and refreshingly pure Mode.  \\"Precious\\" is to PTA what \\"It's No Good\\" was to Ultra--absolutely superb.  \\"The Sinner In Me\\" is the foil to \\"the Mercy in You\\" on SOFAD.  Other great tracks include John the Revelator, Suffer Well, I Want It All, Nothings Impossible and the very impressive \\"Lilian.\\"  Overall this is a good rebound from Exciter.  The last song on the album--\\"Dark Star\\", was (other than the title) weak.  Martin's lead vocal tracks were also weak this time around which was a shame and kept it from 5 stars.  I typically look forward to his lead vocals but these are sub-par for him in a number of ways.  Dave's songwriting was an impressive 3 for 3!  I think it would be cool for Dave and Martin to write a song together for the next album.  Even better would be Alan re-joining the band or producing but, alas, I am probably like a kid with a fantasy of reuniting divorced parents (have I been listening to Precious too much??).  Anyways, I'm looking forward to the concert. Ciao!
B00003CXSP|3.0|The main problem with this second entry in the Lechter series is that is has no focus and it doesn't use the Lechter/Starling relationship to its fullest.  Director Ridley Scott has opted to create a noirish, somewhat gory film whose script wanders around a little too much.  In the ten years since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Lechter has found refuge in Florence, taking over as curator of an art museum; meanwhile, Starling has continued with the FBI, reaching the point where her actions are questioned; she's even received a letter from the Guiness Book of World Records for being the female who has killed the most people.  Add to this the character of Mason Vergis, Lechter's fourth victim and only survivor who peeled off his face at Lechter's request and who now wants to use Starling to lure out Lechter so he can get his revenge.  As if this isn't enough plot, we get an Italian detective who stumbled on to Lechter and wants to get the three million dollar reward offered by Vergis.  HANNIBAL suffers inevitably from being too plot driven and sources indicate screenwriter David Mamet's original script was completely overhauled, although Mamet's name is still in the credits.  Anthony Hopkins continues to instill a strong sense of evil and menace, although this time he is somewhat overdrawn, almost to the point of parody.  Julianne Moore who stepped in when Jodie Foster opted out due to script differences, brings a different approach to Starling, although I'm not sure it's a good one.  Ray Liotta is menacing as a corrupt government official, and his last scenes are grand guignol horror; an uncredited Gary Oldman is lost behind the makeup of Vergis, while Italian superstar Giancarlo Giannini brings a good sense of desperation and greed to his role as the Italian detective.  There is sumptuous photography and New Age artist Hans Zimmer's score is appropriate, but HANNIBAL ends up being mere eye candy and is not as good as the other two films.

0385483821|2.0|This book could have been ONE chapter, but I guess that's hard to sell! I have no idea why this has such a high rating. It's repetitive, internally inconsistent, and so vague as to basically be a bunch of handwaving. If you want a hopelessly out-of-date book about a CEO patting himself on the back, go for it. Bonus- tons of boring anecdotes! (Gotta fill up the pages somehow!)
B00008CLOA|5.0|Another reviewer gave this a low rating admitting he was only rating the cd NOT the sacd. The whole point of getting this is for the sacd capability. Otherwise you just have a cd. Next time perhaps the reviewer should hold judgement until he hears exactly what he is missing. Dark Side of the Moon in 5.1 is what he is missing. Listen to that then make your judgement on this disc. Im sure you will be enlightened.
0385482582|1.0|Maybe I haven't read enough \\"management\\" books (though I do have an MBA), but if this is considered \\"great\\" for this genre- WOW. This entire book could have been summed up in a couple pages without losing any major points, but I guess you can't have a bestseller that way! One reviewer said it was too technical. Are you living in a cave? I found it condescendingly written- absurdly simple and dumbed down. Granted, it's over a decade old, but I doubt everyone was really that much stupider ten years ago.

This movie is terrible because nearly all the Godzilla shots are at night or are underground; there are almost no complete body shots of the G-myster. Plus there are no other monsters; it's just Godzy against helicopters and jets. We loved GZ VS Megurious, and GMK.
B000A88F22|5.0|I'm one of those people who's loved Britney Spears since she first charmed me on the Mickey Mouse Club, years and years ago. I used to have the biggest crush on her.<br /><br />Then in '98, my mom pulled me into the living room to show me a video of this cute little girl with a belly shirt singing \\"Baby One More Time\\". She was adorable and I remembered as soon as I saw her who she was. The same little girl who wooed me back in '92! I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />...Fast forward to this time in her career and it's a different story! She's a lot.. different. But I still love her! It's cool that I've been here for all of this and I've basically watched her grow into this extremely powerful superstar. I've seen every performance, have every cd, and I have about 300+ mp3s of her on my computer, including all her bside tracks and live performances..<br /><br />But this show takes the cake. Out of everything I've seen about her, this is the most personal insight into her. Even though Kevin is there, which I hate him, it's still nice to get this close and personal to my favorite artist of all time.<br /><br />Britney is definitely very down-to-earth, and she's absolutely hilarious because of it. When her southern drawl comes out, when she's scared on the plane, when she's scared on the bus. You can't help but laugh through some tears. I've always known she was funny, but this is just completely hilarious. And I must admit, watching this makes it a LITTLE easier to like Kevin. He's just downright obnoxious and immature, and it's pretty cute to watch Britney deal with him.<br /><br />Overall, if you're not a Britney fan, you probably ain't gonna get anything from it. If you are, I'm sure you already own it. I recommend it to everyone though. If you want a laugh, it's great. If you wanna make fun of her, you can get this for that too. But don't forget Britney fans are the most rabid of any set you'll find, so be careful what you say!!
B000A6T1HC|5.0|Ever since I heard clips online, I knew this album is going to be amazing and it is.  Ms.Bartoli is not only amazing at singing runs like no tomorrow, but she really brought so much life into Baroque music on this CD.  Why this repertoire would be prohibited is beyond me, it's just gorgeous music taking to another level.  Ms.Bartoli is currently touring and I just saw her live in concert with Orchestra La Scintilla of Zuerich Opera.  last night.  Absolutely blew me away and the audience just wouldn't let her leave, ended up doing four encore pieces!  My favourite pieces on this album is \\"Vanne pentita a piangere\\" (which Ms.Bartoli just stunned the audience with during the concert!), \\"Un pensiero nemico di pace\\", \\"Sparga il senso lascivo veleno\\", \\"Come nembo che fugge col vento\\", \\"Lascia la spina cogli la rosa\\", \\"Si piangete pupille dolente\\" and definitely \\"Disserraveti oh porte d'Averno\\".  This album has to be her best so far!
0316776963|2.0|I'd never heard of David Sedaris when I recently picked up this book in a sale at my local bookstore -- skimming the first couple pages and reading the backcover blurbs made it seem worth the discounted price. <br /> <br />Overall, my opinion of the book strongly concurs with that of Jeannette C. (October 18, 2005), the book wasn't bad in any way, or even dull or tedious. It just was a book to read, a way to pass some time. <br /> <br />The first story was probably the most amusing, certainly the most engaging. Some of the others seemed to be a pointless meander down memory lane, in particular 'The Rooster'. These remembrances could be funny in the right context, with some background, but within the confines of the book they were nothing more than words on a page. <br /> <br />The second half, dealing with the author's soujourn in France, was slightly more entertaining, though a bit heavy on the bitter self-deprecation. <br /> <br />I can't say I was sorry when I got to the last page though. <br /> <br />For me, the \\"funniest person writing today\\" is, without question, Terry Pratchett of Discworld fame.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|i never really \\"got\\" this band--too many synthy patches, i.e. not enough guitars, and fey vox that seemed offputting and, at times, silly.  not till this release, at least.  sure i've heard the hits down the years.  nevertheless, this is a very impressive CD:  if only \\"precious\\" and \\"Oh Lilian\\" were on it, it'd be a delicious treat.  dark dancey majestic beauty throughout.  \\"precious\\" is a guitar triumph--on a par with some of New Order's prettiest numbers.  i don't quite get why \\"john the revelator\\" is a single--it's a goth stomp that doesn't seem very memorable.  i'll have to listen to it again, natch.  with THE CURE, THE <br />BLACK WATCH, and NEW ORDER, DM is my new favorite band--that's really weird!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Finally Depeche is back on track. As other reviewers said, Playing The Angel recalls the \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion\\" era with the upbeat tracks (\\"John The Revelator\\", \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\"), and the \\"Ultra\\" era with the slower tracks (\\"I Want It All\\", \\"Damaged People\\"). Every single track stands out and as a zealot fan I'm confident to say that without a doubt this album is one of the best they have ever made. Just check it out and you will know why I'm claiming this. I'll bet you'll be positively surprised.
0393324818|4.0|Moneyball is more about the money and less about the ball, as the book is definitely intended for a mass-market, business-oriented audience. Lewis's general theme is that baseball, like business, is a numbers game, and the victor is usually the person or group who can maximize their efficiency.<br /><br />True to the New Journalism style of Michael Lewis, you can't come away from this book without feeling emotionally involved and deeply partisan, like you're part of some enlightened David fighting an establishment Goliath.<br /><br />Serious baseball afficianados will quickly recognize Lewis's oversimplifications and hyperbole, but most can move beyond that to see what is, more than anything, a finally crafted story with deep interest.
B00006RU5B|5.0|You wouldn't expect a Soundgarden front-man and the instrumentalists from Rage Against the Machine to seamlessly mesh together as well as they have in this debut.  The music itself is true to Rage's roots, but Chris Cornell throws in some great modern rock ballads in \\"Like a Stone\\" and \\"I Am the Highway.\\" <br />This is powerful stuff, best listened to at high volume.  Highly recommended for fans of the former bands.
0446608955|4.0|After watching the movie I knew I had to read the book. It was very different but in a good way. I enjoyed that in the book it talks more about how sweet Jamie was. It was a bit of a disapoment to know that didnt get to stand at her wedding  but at the same time it was so sweet that Landon knelt with her that I almost didnt care. Every girl should read this book because it tells girls how a guy should really treat them.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|No Sci-Fi movie to date can beat the original Star Wars.  This box set is a must for any fan.  The bonus disc alone delivers exciting behind the scenes features that are truly inspiring as well as entertaining.
B000055Y0X|4.0|This movie is a great movie because of the use of satire.  If you understand the concept of satire use then this movie is outragously funny! It basicallly makes fun of the human race and how they think in the world.  The main character in the movie tries his hardest to basically blow up the world because of what he is trained to do.  The General tries to contact them and doesn't get through...of course.  During class i thought the movie was kind of funny but the teacher had to explain some of the satire in the movie because it was a little outragous.  It is also funny how the colonel goes crazy about the floritization of water and how he lost his manly fluids because of it and this koo koo guy starts this whole thing over his manly uses and makes American's fight American's because of it.  You should deffinatly get the movie if you love satires.
0679731725|5.0|...for a very borring, at first, slow moving, well written literature. I hope that you will be able to go through it much faster then I. The book touches on many points one of which is loyalty to profession and love.
B000AL730O|1.0|Monumental twaddle. <br /> <br />How do you sleep \\"Teddy Boy\\"? <br /> <br />With your nation (and the world) off the rails, this is the best you could come up with. <br /> <br />I would suggest you buy (or borrow) George Harrison's last album and listen to \\"Brainwashed\\". It might give you some ideas. God knows you need some.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Well Ive read the reviews and honestly, those who claim the album is boring, full of lifeless beeps and weired noises, I think are slightly missing the point .... <br />I was 14 when I first discovered Depeche Mode with 'See You' back in 1982. I followed them through their pop phase early 80's, electronic dance mid 80's, rock/electronic 90's and like all good wines they have matured extremely well. <br /> <br />Im 37 now and at Depeche Mode are in their 40's. I think this is a great effort considering their near implosion as a group and yes it would be great if they would make classics like People are People, Enjoy the Silence, Strangelove but I think everyone would agree that we all have to evolve. <br /> <br />To those who think the analogue sounds are strange and boring, try listening to the album a few times, on a good hifi system, be patient. I assure you, these songs will GROW on you. Suffer Well, <br />I want it All (with it's luscious soundscape),Precious, Lillian are absolute classics. I'll never forget seeing Depeche peform live at Wembley in 1986 and Manchester in 1988. Im looking forward to seeing them perform their new songs in Atlanta in 2005. Bravo Depeche Mode
B0000DZ3EA|2.0|Peter Gabriel tries to be arty but his poor composition skills and squeal vocals get the best of him. Thus, most of his material suffers from lack of good composers- he is really missing the talents of Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford. He also tries to be too funky and \\"womad\\" infusing as many different sounds as possible but not really amounting to anything of substance. Almost a one star rating but the wonderful Solisbury Hill and Games Without Frontiers save this dreadful compilation. It's is a shame that he did not continue along the lines of those two wonderful early tunes. Nice to have Sean Connery as a special guest- or is that Gabriel???  Go back to Genesis 007 !!
0689835604|5.0|She just turned one and after reading the book to her one time,all you have to do is ask Where is your Belly Button?She finds hers,mine and anyone elses you ask her about,so cute,
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I'm just happy that Depeche Mode is still putting out recordings. I'm old enough to remember life before the internet, when I didn't have to hear from the masses. All of these unheard voices that need someone to listen to them. Don't criticize, create something of your own. I know that everyone has a right to their opinion - but do you have to share it.  Thank you DM for giving me another CD for my listening pleasure.  2 of 5 people found the following review helpful in forming an original thought.
B0002S947K|5.0|I had only heard a couple of the songs on this CD on the radio so I was a bit apprehensive about buying it.  I am so glad I did!  Each song is different but similiar in style.  It may sound like an oxymoron but it is not.  I'm looking forward to the next offering by this talent!
B000002C4J|5.0|The voice. The personality. The songs. It just clicked toghether in total harmony. This is earbalsam for your soul. She sells tons of records. Many critics in the more or less academic league gives here one star or less, in some magazines and newspapers. But the fans (including me) loves here music anyway. She has total controll over here voice register. Not much songs here that not have love in the title and lyrics. Ok, Let`s talk about love. This album has so many stricking songs. The Love theme from Titanic really strikes a nerve in me, and i can listen to it again and again, and my heart pumping in the same rythm as the song. Celine Dion realy strikes a nerve in those of us who are not totally  among the hipsters league and always looks for new trends. Better keep it simple. As Beatles says in one of theire songs: All you need is love. It`s some times a cold,cold,world out there. Celine reminds us about other values in the world.  As she says it: There`s one trough emotion, that reminds me we are the same.....  Celine Dion Let`s talk about love. Yeeees Indeed. Celine.
B000055Y0X|4.0|The movie Dr. Strangelove is a black and white film making fun of what would happen if the world was condemned to destruction by a \\"Dooms Day Device\\" made by the Russians and detonated to go off if their country was bombed. Unfortunately for the world, a crazy Military General commanded bombers to attack Russia since he felt they were going to attack anyways. He also gives the bomber pilots a code to let them know when they should listen to the radio for commands. Fortunately, someone finds out the code, sends it out to the pilots, and the world is saved, except that one plane was hit which messed up any way they could see what code is sent out, so they end up being the \\"heroes\\" of the story and get the job done.   <br />I had to watch this for my English class and I did have the teacher's help explaining what parts were supposed to be funny and why exactly they were so humorous. It is loaded with satire, which you might not catch until the second time you watch it. This movie was somewhat eccentric in parts, like Dr. Strangelove's hand trying to choke him, and yet it is still funny even though the oddness of each character is surprising since these are supposed to represent the leaders of our country. I did find some parts of the movie very funny these parts were mostly when the leaders of the country were in the war room discussing what must be done to save the world. Also, the part with the bomber pilot steering down the explosive with his cowboy hat and Woohooing all the way down was definitely a \\"tear jerker\\". This film was not exactly one of the best or funniest I have seen and I would certainly recommend renting the movie before buying it, but I would defiantly watch this a second and third time. <br />
0062502182|5.0|this book confirmed once again for me the validity of the life i've been leading all along; my life. it was like looking in the mirror. wenever i listen to others advice i lose God's protection, but wen i follow my \\"personal legend\\" everything falls into place and i win. the message in this book is awesome and i believe that the alchemist should be required reading for every eighth grade or highschool curriculum
B000197KUS|5.0|There was only two ways that G3 could have been better than the original lineup with Eric Johnson. Since Jason Becker is currently confined to a wheelchair, that leaves one solid option, and Steve/Joe selected the best option - Yngwie Malmsteen. Yngwie draws a lot of criticism because most guitarist are jealous of his ability to pioneer neoclassical music on guitar (which he certainly did, and many others like Marty Friedman and Tony MacAlpine and even shredders like Paul Gilbert owe Yngwie a tribute for that). If you like listening to speed guitar with the infusion of elements of blues, classical, and basic rock where appropriate, I recommend grabbing this album and ALSO grabbing anything by Yngwie Malmsteen. Then I recommend graduating to Racer X or Cacaphony. One thing is clear, anyone who denounces Yngwie's playing as mere showiness or hackneyed obviously knows very little about the guitar as an instrument. Too bad.
0739307312|4.0|i dont know which narrator was reading the version i heard but whoever he was (i had the audio cassete version) he was a delight to listen to. he told the story with great accents and voices and it was a pretty cool tale. i definitely wouldn't read that book tho, it wasn't good enough to read, but the audio version was splendid
B00003CXCT|5.0|Yeah I said it. :)  George Lucas needed to step back a LONG time ago and allow a talented writer to handle the screenplays.  Ah well, Despite the little guys stilted, childish dialogue the movies are still super cool.<br /><br />The box set has lots of extras and is worthwhile.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This album is full of hits and is probably the best album I've heard all year. I got it in my 5-disk cd changer and it aint gonna be going anywhere anytime soon.
B000BC8SS8|5.0|Ironically I got this album a little over a year ago. It's always been a favorite since then, and has never left my cd book. Now available with not just two bonus tracks, but a bonus dvd as well that features the original EPK of the band's performance at the Downtown club in Long Island, four music videos, and a documentary on the making of this album plus bonus footage from the Long Island show. This special edition is indeed worth selling your current copy for if you're a fan. Check it out.
B00000ADG2|5.0|except for those annoying interludes. Lauryn Hill is the greatest, most versatile artist of all time.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Most films these days are more interested in getting a message out than telling a historical story. Kingdom of Heaven is not an exception to the rule. The history of the beginning of the third crusade is less important than the message \\"why can't we all just get along\\". <br /> <br />Having said that, Kingdom of Heaven is an entertaining movie for those willing to suspend historical accuracy. Well filmed and well acted with some wonderful scenery, this film is not a full meal, but is certainly a good enough snack to satisfy. <br /> <br />Historical problems: <br />* The events chronicled take place over many years (10 if you just include the battles, 17 if you include when Balian actually gained control of Ibelin) <br />* Balian is not the son of Godfrey <br />* The masacre of the caravan shown in the film took place years after the event <br />* Saladin beheaded Raymond III of Tripoli, who was not the leader of the Knights Templar (in fact Raymond routinely came in conflict with the Templars and the Hospitaliers, according to historical reports) <br />* Balian participated in the Battle of Hattin (was not in Jerusalem at the time) and fled the battle, trampling many of his own men <br />* Balian made an oath to Saladin to not take up arms in the defense of Jerusalem (not in the film), but later broke his oath. He was heading there to get his wife (Maria) and children (John & Philip) and take them to Tripoli. <br />* Balian did knight citizens, but only about 60, in his defense of Jerusalem. Only those from the ranks of the burgesses were so knighted. <br />* [SPOILER] While Balian did negotiate better terms in the surrender of Jerusalem, it was his insistence that they would all commit suicide rather than let him take the city unfettered. Saladin offered monetary terms to allow the citizens to leave peacefully. <br />* Balian did return to participate in the third crusade, unlike the movies cathartic ending.
B000002HHB|5.0|all of Natalie Merchant's songs are good. This is the only album I have of hers yet but I've got two 10,000 Maniacs c.d.'s (her old band) and what a pleasure it is to hear this woman sing! This c.d. is so beautiful. Everyone needs to have this.
B0009X7664|5.0|I saw \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" when it first came to my local movie theater.  I was around the same age as the kids in the movie.  Even though the movie was set in the South, I felt a connection with these characters because my pre-video game/VCR life was much like theirs.  We made our own adventures.  So the connection was very intense.  I immediately bought the book and read it cover to cover on my own and I loved the book even more.  I was not forced to see it or forced to see the movie in a classroom like the students in the school I used to teach at.  I did all of this willingly.  When the 2 disk anniversary version of this movie was advertised on Amazon.com, I jumped at the chance to own the ultimate edition of this movie.  I think I bought it more for the extra features than the original movie since I had already seen it multiple times.  I was not disappointed.  The Special Features were tremendous.  To think that a movie that was so endearing and social relevant was actually filmed on the back lot of Universal Studios and was so \\"movie fake\\" was so good on the screen all  bound together by one of the best movie sound tracks ever written is a testament to the creators of this motion picture.  It is a classic.  For anyone who wants a nostalgic evening of magic movie making with documentaries, commentaries, behind the scenes, what they look like now, etc. etc.  Immediately buy, borrow, or rent this classic motion picture that I grew up with and now have my own copy thanks to the magic of ownership of the DVD.
B00006FM77|5.0|I love this CD.  I have the old records of this album, all scratched-up and unplayable.  I was thrilled when this was released on CD.  I'd been looking for it for quite awhile.  The music is great, the quality of the CD's are great, and it brings back a lot of memories for me.  I had all the posters from this album wallpapered to the walls of my bedroom as a kid.  It's great to see the posters and booklet replicated here.  I grew up listening to Chicago, I have albums I-VII.  After that they became too pop-oriented for me.  This has always been my favorite, and I'm glad to have it.  I recommend it to any old timer Chicago fan!!
B0009MWAVQ|5.0|This recent re-release of Scott Ross's complete recordings of Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas is truly a great a accomplishment.  The 34 CDs contain all 555 sonatas.  The vast majority are played by Ross on the harpsichord, or harpsichord's I should say.  Four different harpsichords were used, one Italian and three French.  While various groups of Sonatas might sound a bit different it doesn't take away from the experience at all. <br /> <br />And what an experience it is.  Ross's harpsichord playing is bright and lively when required, relaxed and subdued at other times.  While it's hard to imagine that Ross was able to become intimately familiar with 555 sonatas over the year it took to record them, his performances do not show any signs of boredom.  The sonatas are overall focused and well performed. <br /> <br />In addition to the hundreds of harpsichord sonatas, there are also recordings of Scarlatti's five sonatas with string and woodwing accompaniment as well as his three organ sonatas.  All keyboard parts are played by Ross. <br /> <br />The packaging of this set is very compact.  Each CD is in a thick   paper cover, the whole of the set in a single box.  There is also a 255 page booklet that contains a short description of nearly every sonata.  Additionally there is an interview with Ross from 1986. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful set for any fan of Scarlatti and Ross.  And at the price, it would even be worth it for anyone who enjoys Baroque harpsichord music but isn't familiar with Scarlatti.  I highly recommend this set.
6305291446|4.0|When it comes right down to it, like it or not, this is the true Halloween 3.  We all know that the original Halloween 3 had nothing at all to do with the first two films.  The other sequels 4 - 6, began branching off the main characters as extended family of the Laurie Strode character who was supposed to be dead.  With Halloween H20, the sequels 4 to 6 are basically tossed out the window and erased from accepted Halloween Canon.  The good news is that none of those films were particularly great and other than the inclusion of Donald Pleasance as the avenging Dr. Loomis, they are most forgettable.<br /><br />Not that this film is perfect mind you..it takes some awfully big leaps in logic.  It's supposed to be 20 years later and Laurie Strode is now the head-master of an exclusive private school.  Years ago she faked her death and took on the alias of Keri Tate in order to hide herself from her brother Michael.  But when papers of Dr. Loomis that reveal her true identity come up missing, the Shape is once again on her trail, bent on finishing the job he started 20 years earlier.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett plays Strode's son John who is supposed to leave with most of the rest of the kids on a trip, but instead stays in the almost emply school grounds with his girlfriend and several other kids to have their own private party free from adults.  Naturally they are the first to encounter Michael Myers who manages to slip past the worlds worst security guard played by L.L. Cool J.<br /><br />Despites some of the implausibilites of the script, it's the most effective thriller in the series since Halloween II.  The scene where Laurie manages to lock a door before michael can get her, but they still come face to face due to a window is a genuinely creepy scene.  Add to that is the fact that H20 Director Steve Minor was a far more experienced and accomplished director than the three guys who did the previous sequels and you have a far more effective film.<br /><br />All in all, when if comes right down to it, this is the true Halloween 3!ll in all, when if comes right down to it, this is the true Halloween 3!
B000BC8STM|2.0|Okay, first they cut the hell out of the show when the put in on VHS and now they are cutting it even more on DVD. Where is Many Rivers To Cross, Tougher Than The Rest, Hold On, Take It To The Limit? I pray the tracklisting is an error and we will get the full concert on DVD.
B000025XE5|5.0|The success of Wet wet wet's cover of Love is all around, featured in the soundtrack of Four weddings and a funeral and which spent many weeks at number one in the UK charts, sparked interest in the original sixties version by the Troggs, whose style was raw rock'n'roll. Their lead singer, Reg Presley, had a distinctive, suggestive style.<br /><br />The Troggs began their run of chart hits with Wild thing, a novelty song that reached number two in the UK but topped the charts for six weeks in America. By the time it peaked in America, the Troggs were on their second UK single - With a girl like you, which went all the way to number one. Thus, they occupied the number one positions in Britain and America simultaneously, but with different songs, but they never reached number one again in either country. Nevertheless, they had several other major UK hits including Love is all around, I can't control myself and Anyway that you want me, all of which made the UK top ten, together with the top twenty UK hits Give it to me and Night of the long grass.<br /><br />This collection includes all the essentials. The Troggs were a somewhat odd sixties group but that's why they are worth listening to.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The folks at Pixar can do no wrong with Monsters, Inc., the studio's fourth feature film, which stretches the computer animation format in terms of both technical complexity and emotional impact. The giant, blue-furred James P. \\"Sulley\\" Sullivan (wonderfully voiced by John Goodman) is a scare-monster extraordinaire in the hidden world of Monstropolis, where the scaring of kids is an imperative in order to keep the entire city running. Beyond the competition to be the best at the business, Sullivan and his assistant, the one-eyed Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), discover what happens when the real world interacts with theirs in the form of a 2-year-old baby girl dubbed \\"Boo,\\" who accidentally sneaks into the monster world with Sulley one night. Director Pete Doctor and co-directors David Silverman and Lee Unkrich follow the Pixar (Toy Story) blueprint with an imaginative scenario, fun characters, and ace comic timing. By the last heart-tugging shot, kids may never look at monsters the same, nor artists at what computer animation can do in the hands of magicians.
B000AL730O|1.0|Been a Beatle fan since '63. Held off buying this one for a few weeks. Bought it and was playing it all week. My wife (Beatle fan too) finally said to me,\\"What is that cd you've been playing to death, gawd it's awful!\\" When I told her it was McCartney, she just rolled her eyes and said \\"getting old isn't pretty sometimes\\" and walked out of the room. Sadly , I feel the same way. This cd is terrible considering who made it. Hey, even if it wasn't Paul McCartney it's still a terrible album!! Ringo's recent albums have been better!
B000A6CLL0|4.0|I didn't watch much Enterprise when it was on, unfortunately. Scheduling conflicts prevented me from fully enjoying the series, even though I did manage to catch the occasional episode. It's a great benefit to people like me, then, that the entire run is now on DVD. <br /> <br />The full season DVD set is especially useful for this third season, because the entire season is essentially one extended episode. The Xindi Saga. <br /> <br />It's interesting to watch as Archer and the crew (and the fledgling Starfleet, for that matter) respond to a terrorist attack on the planet Earth. All of the emotions that we felt after 9/11 are present in this season -- as are the decisions that we've had to make (for good or ill). We see the conflict among the Xindi, and then we watch the various factions in Iraq battle for control. The parallels are interesting to watch, and are very much in tune with the tone set by Roddenberry in the original Star Trek. <br /> <br /> <br />Equally interesting are the scenes involving the Xindi council. We see a people who are not (all) warlike and violent, but who are intent on saving their homeworld from destruction by the human \\"threat\\" 400 years in the future. Bad guys who aren't (all) quite so bad is part of the Star Trek experience -- even Klingons are now seen as a race governed by a sense of honor that humans cannot quite equal. <br /> <br />In the middle of this political commentary, a little social commentary is thrown in for good measure. In \\"Similitude,\\" Tripp is seriously injured. Flox creates a clone, to attempt to help save Tripp's life. But the clone has other ideas about life, and whose should be saved. The episode gives a whole new perspective on the issue of cloning. <br /> <br />Season three of Enterprise shows a lot of the promise that the series had. I grew tired quickly of the \\"Enterprise as backstory\\" idea that seems to plague much of the series, and I enjoyed seeing an alien race that we don't ever see again in any Star Trek incarnation. Enterprise was at its strongest when it was allowed to function as its own series, rather than being so dependant on the rest of the Star Trek franchise.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I know it is cliche to say that this is the best since Violator, but it is true.  Songs of Faith & Devotion and Ultra were great albums but had a few weak moments that tended to make the entire album drag a little (and Exciter was anything but exciting).  Precious, John the Revelator, A Pain That I'm Used To, and Lilian are some of their strongest (and most instantly likeable) songs of their career.  The other songs are mostly strong as well but are more of the typical Depeche Mode songs that take some time to fully appreciate and love.<br /><br />I almost didn't buy this album as I was losing hope that they could live up to their 80's and early 90's output, but the strong reviews from the music press piqued my interest.  I am so glad I gave this a chance as it is one of the best of the year.<br /><br />Edit: Songs of Faith and Devotion is the better album.
B0000062Y2|1.0|For the DVD version I would give this a 5-star rating. However, as others have pointed out, this 'remaster' actually sounds worse than the original 1974 vinyl version! Everything sounds like it was recorded in a tin can, and there is an annoying silence inserted between every track for no apparent reason other than to ruin the flow of the album. What were they thinking? The way they treated this great music borders on offensive. If you want to hear how this music *should* sound, get the DVD or even VHS.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I've only listened to this album twice, yet the music and words already stick. <br /> <br />The album has a really good sound to it.  The songs are full of memorable harmonies and melodies, and the engineering/production is top notch.  Much of the synthesis is done using high-end synthesis and effect software, mostly Native Instrument's \\"Reaktor\\".  The advances of synthesis techonology has clearly affected DM's sound in a very positive way.  After 25 years of electronic based music, Depeche mode is clearly still at the cutting edge. <br /> <br />The first single \\"Precious\\", by the way, was written by Martin as he went through a recent divorce.  The song was written for his children.   <br /> <br />This is the best Depeche Mode album since violator.
B000B9EY2U|5.0|Depeche Mode couldn't have picked a better time for a comeback, on the eve of their 25 year anniversary and with many of their peers from the 80's making impressive comebacks (i.e. New Order). Exciter was too digital and Ultra was released during a dark period in DM's history. On \\"Playing the Angel\\", DM gives the analog snythesizers a 2005 kick. Tracks like \\"A Pain That Im Used To\\" and \\"The Sinner in Me\\" are sonic soundscapes full of experimentism. \\"John The Relevator\\" has an extremely mean and catchy riff to it, it could be a huge song if released as a single. \\"Precious\\" is a beautiful song about a failed marriage and the effects on the children. Their is one big thing that seperates this album from prior DM releases, David Gahan has three writing credits! The songs that Gahan contributed are very strong, \\"Suffer Well\\" is remiscent of \\"Behind the Wheel\\" with thumping drums. \\"I Want It all\\" has a great disconnected, nocturnal sound. \\"Damaged People\\" is also very good, with its mumured vocals and driving synths and some chilling effects. \\"Lilian\\" is a pure dance song with bittersweet emotion. Their is no filler on \\"PTA\\", all the tracks have their place. A classic DM release. The deluxe edition is the purchase to make for DM fans, the 5.1 is great and the extras are very cool.
B000002U9E|5.0|This might be Kate's greatest album and since there's already over a hundred gushing reviews, I'll just say it's amazing, intoxicating and powerful.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|We've all seen the films so there's no need for me to summarize.   <br /> <br />As with most people, I loved the first two films and could easily have done without the latter two.  However, seeing the features that all the films in this set were going to have, I purchased the entire thing and I'm glad I did.   <br /> <br />The commentary on all films is entertaining and informative and it even makes it bearable to make through Shumacher's follies.  The real treat lies with the documentaries however.  Tons of interviews with many people involved, wonderful insight, and a whole new perspective on all the movies. <br /> <br />This is a set that I have been hoping would come along for many years and it hasn't disappointed.  This is a must for all Bat-Film lovers.
B000006U44|5.0|The genius appears on the stage, with monstrous talent and ravishing beauty.....
0812550706|5.0|This is a great book. It is the story of the rollercoaster ride through the childhood of a boy that would become the savior of the human race. Many twists and turns brings out what I would consider to be one of the greatest fears that we have deep within each of us. One that we could be totally annihilated as a species. Cannot wait to get the next. <br />
B000007MVL|5.0|Kate was in the zone, creating great album after great album after great album.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Marvelous edition. Magic concert. A must have. Really
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I'm a throwback when it comes to horror films. I love the gore but seeing something I've never seen before impresses me more than anything. With that being said, many of today's horror movies don't capture the essence of what a horror movie should be. Way too many remakes of classic horror movies that hollywood has destroyed, with the newest being \\"The Fog\\". <br /> <br />\\"Saw\\" has all the elements that make up an amazing flick and wastes no time in getting to them. Great spooky images (the clown), suspense throughout, twists and turns, creepy musical score which adds to the setting and one of the most unbelivable, unexpected endings ever. A refreshing change and a diamond in the rough of newer horror films. A fantastic film that should be added to any horror fans collection!
B00025ETIW|3.0|the whole new rock thing isn't really my thing(e.g. p!atd, killers, used) but i gotta say these guys really caught my ear. Helena is a great track i gotta say. some sick guitar and sweet lyrics....
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Martin did NOT write all these songs.  Dave wrote three and generally you can tell.  They are a bit trite for my tastes.  As for pretentiousness cropping up in MArtin's vocally led songs, that's bogus for anyone who is a fan of Depeche.  The appeal of MArtin is exactly the effect these songs give off.   <br /> <br />In short, not their greatest, but enough highlights to continue to be relevant.  Can't wait for the tour! <br />
B000002JPA|3.0|Let's get straight to the point: <br /> <br />\\"Pull me Under\\" is boring. I wonder why it got so much airplay. <br />Oh well, atleast MTV airs something that can actually be classified as music. <br /> <br />\\"Take the Time\\" starts with an awesome intro. Adds awesome vocals, and swifts into one of the best solo's ever. Far superior to everything else on this cd. <br /> <br />\\"Another Day\\" is nothing special, and neither is \\"Surrounded.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Metropolis\\" starts boring, goes into an awesome 4-minute solo, and ends boring. So it's almost as if it goes full circle. *giggle* <br /> <br />\\"nder a Glass Moon,\\" bah, NEXT! <br /> <br />\\"Wait for Sleep\\" has a cool intro, thats pretty much it for this song. <br /> <br />\\"Learning to Live\\" is boring. Seriously. Everyone seems to love this song, and I just don't understand why. Oh well. <br />
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens for my 20D after quite a bit of research and wasvery happy with it.  It was the lens I kept on the camera and found it to be Very good value for the money - well made and solid.  The range is also pretty good, and if you only have 1 lens this should be your choice (unless you want to spend 3 times the money).  I suspect for the average person this will be more than adequate.<br />Update:  12-07.  I have since sold this lens and have the 24-105 L in it's palce.  I believe my new lens is superior but looking back at my photos taken with the 28-135 I must say I very much miss the reach I got with it.  I find the 24-105L shots are definitely more crisp but the old photos I took with the 28-135 still hold up well. After all, you are paying about 3x as much for the 24-105....I Still recommend the 28-135 IS lens  as a general lens.<br /><br />I have 8 other Canon lens including the 70-200L, and prefer them to off brands for the 20D .
B00008H2LB|4.0|You know what? I'm sick of people using Linkin Park in their insults against other bands. In the review section of most metal bands, there's always someone who doesn't like it and says something stupid like \\"Go listen to your damn nu-metal like Linkin Park, p****,\\" and such...  That being stupid because Linkin Park isn't even Nu-Metal.    I actually like this band, and this cd for that matter. It's got lots of fairly simple songs, yet each one is completely different from it's predecessors. And ALL the songs on this cd are enjoyable to listen. Hell, even the lyrics aren't bad.    I'd take this band over any Nu-Metal.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|I can't believe they have this movie now on dvd and the best part is its even UNRATED which is cool, I saw this in the theatre but with an R arting, so this is just really totally awesome. I just don't have a lot to say about this movie because I want you to watch it instead, this movie is not for the weak stomach and squemish viewers, one of the best horror/gore movie of the year that I have ever seen, low budget films are often the ones that are awesome like this movie, or \\"High Tension\\" \\"Wrong Turn\\" etc..  For those who rated this movie a 1 star, don't believe them, I wonder why they watch this movie if they are into a Love Story genre movies, duh!  Go for it, buy this dvd.
0684853523|4.0|I'd never recommend this book to a young writer unless they already have a decent amount of knowledge on the business. This book offers little writing advice, and a lot of it is very opinionated, which can throw a new writer off of his or her developing style. So as a how-to book this book offers little. But as a book of what not to do when the stress of writing is too high this is the best. Most of us have heard of Stephen King's past troubles, but this book tells it graphically and with no excuses left behind by the author. It a caution sign on the road of writing, telling you to stay straight and not to turn off on those drug filled rest stops. For that alone, this book is worth the read. More for the reader, though, and not the writer.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is a sequal to Final Fantasy VII... <br /> <br />Set two years after the events of Final Fantasy VII, Cloud now leads a solitary life traveling the Planet as a transporter. The office of Strife Delivery Service is located in 7th Heaven, which also functions as an orphanage for children stricken with Geostigma. <br /> <br />The graphics are amazing! The people look so real! The background is amazing as well. The fight scenes are probably the best part. <br /> <br />The sound effects are great! And the music is beautiful, especially \\"One Winged Angel\\". Some songs have been remixed and some are new.  <br /> <br />All in all, it's great. A big Final Fantasy fan would enjoy this, I'm pretty sure. Atleast I did. The Japanese version is out right now and the English version...I'm not so sure of. We will just have to wait and see. <br /> <br />&lt;Elizabeth> <br /> <br />
B0000CNY27|4.0|Consider me sheltered, but I only recently saw Escape from New York, and perhaps the dated feeling is the reason why I gave it four stars rather than five. It's an apocolypse tale based in the year 1997, a year far gone already, in which New York has become the world's penal colony and where the President of the United States has crashed landed. The hero, Snake, must go in and save him or die. Obviously, he chooses to save the president and goes.<br /><br />That's most of the story. What follows is countless scenes of action. The action is well-done and convincing if a little dated. Though I'm sure at the time of the original filming Snake was unique, he's now the common anti-hero character that dominates most Hollywood action films today. I'd recommend this movie for anyone who loves decent action flicks, cult films, or are John Carpenter Fans.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Back on the road with The MODE,  Depeche Mode is back to greatness.<br /><br />Ok first of all, i just want to say that for those so called 25 years and blahblablah die hard fans of this great band according to those beautiful reviews of yours where some of you have already stated that what's all the hip about this new disc? cuz you think that it's not even close to albums like Violator and Black celebration, Well let me just ask you this are you a real fan of this band or are you just killing time here? because just to start the track PRECIOUS is worth the price of the whole album. Playing The Angel is the ultimate Electropop Masterpiece, created by the best electronic band and one of the best music groups in the history of Alternative. Please for the love of God let  Alan wilder go and open your eyes and hearts to this amazing album and discover it's incredible hidden magic. I agree that Exiter was a definitely let down for many of you, but please let it go, Here comes the Angel to give us that link that we've been missing for so long, and for those poor souls that haven't purchased the disc yet, Playing The Angel is the album that you have been waiting for.  Just second to VIOLATOR on the all time best list. A must have for all True old and new DM fans out there.
B000AARKO4|3.0|The movie industry has been well-known for taking books and history and changing it to suit their cinematic needs. Kingdom of Heaven isn't one of those films, and after watching it, I now know why directors and writers change things. While it isn't entirely true (some of the early scenes in the movie were fake), most of it is, including the characters and battles that happens. It does keep your interest all the way up until the end, where it will then leave you feeling a little cheated. Without spoiling much, I can say that this is where the director Ridley Scott should have applied the Hollywood touch.<br /><br />This is a great movie for those who love world history or for those who love epics (like me). Beyond that, I wouldn't recommend it.
B0007GAERG|5.0|mariah's best albumn ever. Produced and sang to perfection, this truly is a perfect compilation of what she does best.

B000026FOA|5.0|This isn't a review of the album as others have done a pretty good job before me. <br /> <br />I read that the album title does refer to the cigarette roll warning of 'five leaves left' as someone else mentioned in their review, but might easily have conveyed 'five years left'...5 years after the album was released, Drake overdosed. Can't remember where I read this but an interesting theory anyway.

However, in the twilight of the Beatles' existence, a rumor swept the U.S. that Paul was, indeed, dead. This fascinating saga -- how it started, who started it, why it spread so rapidly, and what impact it had and continues to have on our culture -- is explored in the brand-new book, TURN ME ON, DEAD MAN by Andru J. Reeve. Now available right here at Amazon.com  <br /> <br />Soon to be a major motion picture!  <br /> <br />
B00005YIPM|5.0|What can I say about Carole King and Tapestry that hasn't been said already? I'm sure everyone knows just how good this album is. I'd like to comment on the SACD release which I just received from amazon.com. The 5.1 discrete surround mix is really good and although it retains the warmth of the original recording from the 70's, it displays a whole new breathtaking sonic clarity and carole's voice is crystal clear. A highly recommended SACD. Even if you have the original recording of Tapestry, buy this if you have an SACD player. You will not be dissapointed. I 'm still smiling after listening to it for more than 3 times in 2 days!
B0009IW88A|5.0|Batman Begins is an awesome score! No, I don't think it's better than Elfman's originals, \\"although it's a far cry better than Goldenthal's efforts.\\" Batman Begins is an equal effort with Elfman's, and should be respected as a work of art on it's own.  <br /> <br />Track 1 Is a deep, thumping, brassy spectacle. Resulting in rushing blood and an urge to do a million pushups. <br /> <br />Track 2 Is a quiet, atmoshperic piece, reminding one of James Newton Howard's previous work for \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"Signs.\\"  <br /> <br />Track 3 Starts creepy, and eerie, and ends up loud, percussive, and frightening. <br /> <br />Track 4-6 Are my least favorite tracks of the CD, however, some of the sound effects used are blood chilling, and leave you with respect for the composers. <br /> <br />Tracks 7-12 Are BLISS Changing from heavy brass and creepy sounds, to classical-techno hybrid, to slow, moving drama pieces, \\"love theme etc.\\"  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, buy this NOW! :) <br /> <br />Media Lover
0783240287|4.0|If you want something biblically accurate and serious...DON'T BUY THIS. But if you long ago realized that no movie, play, show, etc. with EVER be accurate and you have a good sense of humor, get this!! It is an extravaganza of colors and music.  Just about every kind of singing is in here (even Elvis!). I found it to be an utter riot!
B000AARKOO|4.0|Despite what other reviewers have said, this movie is not \\"Muslim apologetic\\".  Sorry to break it to some people, but Reynald de Chatillon REALLY WAS an out and out, thoroughly contemptible, rapacious brigand.  Guy de Lusignan may not have been QUITE as bad as he is portrayed in this film, but the real Guy was close enough as makes no difference.  In fact, he was so repugnant that the Knights Hospitalers did in fact leave Jerusalem rather than serve him (which means David Thewlis' character should have survived, as he wouldn't have been at Hattin).  The Templar grandmaster (whose name is not given in the film, but whose name, in history was Gerard de Ridefort) REALLY WAS a cruel, fanatical bigot.  Ridley Scott is not being unduly harsh in his portrayal of these men.  They really were evil.  Other facts to ponder.  The crusaders really did massacre the inhabitants of Jerusalem when they took the city in 1098.  Saladin really did refrain from returning the favor when he took the city in 1187.  The crusader army really did make an incredibly stupid blunder and leave a secure position, marching across open desert without water, and was utterly crushed at the Horns of Hattin on July 4, 1187.  Saladin really did spare Guy's life after the victory at Hattin, saying: \\"it is not the custom of kings to kill kings\\".<br /><br />The story is dramatized, and Scott and his writers made liberal use of dramatic license.  But the basic facts of the story are not too inaccurate, and the portrayal of Guy, Reynald, and others among the crusaders is not unfair.  Nor is Scott heaping undue adulation on Saladin out of PC multiculturalism.  Saladin really was known as a chivalrous and merciful opponent -- so much so that he was revered as a chivalric ideal throughout most of Christian Europe, despite being a Muslim.  This is not revisionism; it's accepted history.<br /><br />Another criticism I have read here is that this movie portrays every man of faith as evil.  I have to wonder if the reviewer who said that saw the same movie I did.  Scott doesn't portray all men of faith as evil; he portrays the fanatics as evil.  The same reviewer said the \\"atheist\\" knights were the only good ones.  What atheists?  Balian wasn't atheist.  He fears he has lost his religion, yes.  But he also torments himself as being unworthy, and abandoned by god.  No man would worry about being rejected by a being he doesn't believe in.  The Hospitaller, played by David Thewlis is also a good man, and a man of faith.  He is a member of a religious military order, is Godfrey's confessor, and states at one point that he believes Christ would not order men to commit the crimes that the Pope is ordering them to commit.  King Baldwin, admonishes Balian that he must ultimately answer to God for the things he does in this life, and it will not excuse crimes or wrongdoing to say that others ordered him to it.  These sure don't look like atheists to me.  The two other good men we see in the film, Balian's father Godfrey, and Tiberias, played by Jeremy Irons, never say much about their religious views one way or the other, so why assume they are atheists?  And finally, Saladin, in the movie, though not a Christian, is clearly shown as a man of faith.  At one point he weeps over the bodies of his soldiers who were killed in the assault on Jerusalem, and he prays to God as he does so.<br /><br />If you don't like the film on its artistic merits, fine, that's your priviledge.  But it seems that some of the critics are bashing it for political reasons, and worse, are doing so based on a very distorted view of the movie.the reviewer who said that saw the same movie I did.

Much of Kiyosaki's advice is just plain horrible.  He actually has the nerve to tell people that going to college is a waste of money. Then, he states that everyone should just invest in real estate to get rich (only, he never tells us how to do that--go figure).  If you really want something inspirational to read, try the Motley Fool books.  The authors really know how to invest, and give you a lot of good advice about getting your finances in order.
B00000272N|4.0|If you were to ask most people on the street what genre Alice In Chains were part of, they'd probably respond by saying \\"grunge.\\" While Alice In Chains could be described as grunge; with their Sabbath-like sludgy guitars and growling vocals, they could just as accurately be labeled hard-rock or metal.  While Nirvana and Soundgarden were influenced by Iggy and the Stooges and Black Flag, Alice in Chains paid just as much homage to Van Halen, albeit with heavier, more grinding riffs. Alice in Chains debut album \\"Facelift\\" makes this abundantly clear.<br /><br />Released in 1990, \\"Facelift\\" has an 80s feel to it. Like many other rock albums released in the late 80s/early 90s, \\"Facelift\\" is heavy on melody and sing-along-choruses. That is not to say that \\"Facelift\\" doesn't have the classic AIC sound; it's just that \\"Facelift\\" has some of the staples of the time in which it was released.<br /><br />\\"Facelift\\" pays equal homage to both Black Sabbath and Van Halen. It has the slow, grinding riffs and downbeat, nihilistic themes of Sabbath, but also the screeching solos and urgency of early VH. It's no small wonder why AIC opened up for Van Halen in the early 90s.<br /><br />While \\"Facelift\\" isn't the strongest album in the AIC catalogue, it is still a fine album. It contains some of the bands best songs, and ultimately some of the best rock singles of the 1990s. And even the songs that aren't quite up-to-par are still pretty good.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Facelift\\" is quite strong with the intense \\"We Die Young,\\" and \\"Man in a Box.\\" Both songs, which are usually played back-to-back on the radio, are two of the band's best, most memorable singles. The highly underrated mid-tempo \\"Sea of Sorrow\\" and \\"Bleed the Freak\\" slow the album down a bit, without causing it to loose momentum. The drudging \\"I Can't Remember\\" and \\"Love Hate Love,\\" are quite good, if not a tad overlong.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Facelift\\" is so strong, the mid-section seems to pale in comparison. Much of the second half of the album, \\"It ain't like that,\\" \\"Sunshine\\" \\"Put You Down,\\" and \\"Confusion\\" are good enough, but not great. Fortunately, the album ends on a high note with the sinister \\"I know something about you\\" and the brooding, but catchy \\"Real Thing.\\"<br /><br />While \\"Facelift\\" isn't Alice In Chains best work, it is more than a respectable debut.

B00005JMAH|5.0|Year three hits the DVD shelves thanks to this DVD and again, it does not disappoint.<br /><br />First, the direction was amazing. Alfonso Cuaron did a marvelous job in showing the story with a consistency that makes it beautiful. The visuals he has done were all breathtaking and truly spellbinding, giving me goosebumps everytime i watch this DVD. The serentiy and that forboding mood he has given the story and the new development he has taken in telling Potter's 3rd year was impeccably done.<br /><br />Acting wise, with top rating actors, there was no shortage of talent in this film. The three protagonists gave their best performances to date, especially Emma Watson, and made me feel satisfied with their acting abilities. The new casts members were good, too. Emma Thompson was absolutely hilarious. The Dementors and Buckbeak were marvelously done and rendered. Amazing.<br /><br />The DVD also is full of bonus stuff, behind the scene footage, and other fun extras every Potter fanatic would die to have. So, what else can you ask for? A good movie, great extras, fabulous direction, I give this DVD 5 stars.
0345442970|3.0|Most of the novels written for the Star Wars expanded universe are mainly reminiscent of the films; plenty of adventure, a wry sense of humor, and of course, scintillating lightsaber duels.  Well, I'm here to tell you that Cloak of Deception is not your run-of-the-mill Star Wars novel.    Not to say that I disliked it.  It was actually very difficult to put down once I'd started reading it.  But what sets Cloak of Deception (written by James Luceno) apart from the other novels is that it is very much a political story and not so much an action/adventure tale that you're used to.  Don't get me wrong, there were many parts filled with battles and lightsabers, however the basic story-line deals mainly with the Galactic Senate and its Chancellor as opposed to the Jedi.    Cloak of Deception centers around the mysterious assassination attempt on the life of the Supreme Chancellor Valorum, and the strange ferocity of the Nebula Front group that is currently at odds with the Trade Federation.  What was interesting about this political tale, is that Luceno delves more into the mind and personality of Valorum; a character that had little to no screen time in The Phantom Menace.  Qui-gon Jinn is also quite a significant character in this story, as he travels across across the galaxy, accompanied by his Padawan learner Obi-wan Kenobi, in order to investigate the mysterious Nebula Front that is suspected to have had a hand in the Chancellor's assassination attempt.    Luceno not only includes characters we've already met, but introduces some newcomers as well.  To name a few: Captain Cohl, the rebellious Captain of the Hawk-Bat; Rella, his feisty female first mate; and Havac, the mysterious terrorist.  I must admit, it takes quite a good bit of writing for me to warm up to new characters, however, I found myself rooting for Captain Cohl and his comrades as they found themselves mixed up in the political intrigue.    Overall, I must say this is a very different kind of expandeduniverse novel, though it's definitely not a bad one.  Even if you're turned off by political stories, you might suprise yourself by liking this one.  It's especially interesting to learn more about the trade federation's qualm with the republic and their early plans to blockade Naboo (suggested, of course, by their mysterious benefactor, Darth Sidious).    3/5 stars.  Thanks for reading. :)
0688170528|5.0|Jodi Picoult is now my FAVORITE author of all time. I have been reading (with minor periods of sleep in between) my entire life. This book was one that I could not put down. I read it in less than 24 hours (a record for this working mom) and was sad when it had to come to an end.<br /><br />I grew so attached to these two families through Picoult's perfect descriptions of their emotions and how each person dealt with the tragedy in a different way.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been in love, birthed a child, or who simply loves great literature.

I am already planning to read it again soon.<br />Emma was like so funny and the best thing is she was so ordinary. I could identify with her because I am ordinary too. I too don't tell a lot of people the truth or the whole truth to spare their feelings or just to save my ass!!! I would not consider all those dishonest things that I have done as secrets but when you look at it Emma's way you could say that! I haven't exactly told anyone about it so they are secrets isn't it? Anyway the things she did on plane were not exactly me but who knows how would I react when my plane was going to crash? But on second thoughts I might most probably go with prayers. But I am glad Emma didn't go with just prayers because then all this wouldn't have happened and I would have missed on such a great funny book!<br />Jack acted like such a gentleman throughout the flight and even after that when they met in office but he didn't let an opportunity to tease her pass. And it was these comments of jack that made my day. Besides these comments there were also very funny and hilarious situations that made me laugh out loud.<br />There was not much sex in this book although that doesn't mean no romance because romance was real good. In fact this romance came as a fresh air for me because for sometime now I have been reading romances with more emphasis on sex, sexual chemistry and graphic description of sex scenes. This book was still exciting and I couldn't put it down. I guess sex is may be really way overrated after reading this book. This romance was tender and really involved both of their minds than their bodies. As jack said `the moment you started talking on plane I was gripped'. That is romantic isn't it? Isn't it true that we all want to be loved for what we are than for what we look like?<br />I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who has been missing laughing hard for sometime in their life. This would really make you feel better.ommend it to anyone who has been missing laughing hard for sometime in their life. This would really make you feel better.
B00003CXA4|5.0|How my ratings work:<br />5 - I really liked/loved it<br />4 - I liked it<br />3 - Could've been better/worth a look<br />2 - Just didn't live up to the potential<br />1 - Simply awful<br /><br />Gandhi is one of the greatest biographies ever made. Ben Kingsley is supurb as the spiritual leader, it is no surprise he one the Oscar for best actor. This is one movie that is worth the 3 hour running time.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I watched this film again after seeing it in theaters several years ago, and I had forgotten how cool it was. I remember overhearing a lady in the row in front of me groaning and complaining at every seemingly contrived moment of serendipity that befalls the \\"soul mates\\" played wonderfully by John Cusack and the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale, whom I could stare at forever as well as listen to her speak without ever growing tired of it. Anyhow, I guess I understood the lady's skepticism...this movie does appear to be so outlandishly contrived that it strains credibility. Yet, what appealed to me about this movie is that I had similar moments of serendipity/coincidences with a girl I dated in 2000. Seeing this film brings back my own memories...so trust me when I say that the things in this movie can happen to people. I'm one of those people. <br /> <br />Romantic comedies have the poor habit of following the standard, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy and girl reconcile, and all is happily ever after. This doesn't wander too far from that formula, but its so downright clever, watchable, and enjoyable that you can't help but fall in love with the story and characters. Romantic comedies also tend to feature interesting selections of music, and this one is no different. I actually enjoyed the song selections in this film and not one of them was familiar to me (using oldies that have appeared in countless other films). I especially got a kick out of Lars, the Yanni-esque boyfriend of Sara (Beckinsale). His new age music is poked fun at by Sara and her sidekick friend (played to comedic effect by an SNL-alum), but I actually thought that was cool about him. Eugene Levy also has a couple scene-stealing moments with his usual brand of comedic seriousness and Jeremy Piven plays the sidekick role he often plays in films. <br /> <br />This film throws every obstacle to keep the two apart and its an amusing development to watch. Overall though, you know the two are destined to betogether and its just as well. So, for all the skeptics out there who find this film outlandishly contrived, please suspend your disbelief and realize that such romantic possibilities and coincidences are possible. I experienced it myself a few years ago, so that's why I find this film to be quite credible, not to mention funny and entertaining in its own right.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|The original 'Batman' film holds, for all Bat-fans, a sacred title as the one true (and certainly best) film in the original saga. The mere fact that it grossed hundreds of millions of dollars and shattered box office records is a testament to its validity as a cinematic tour de force. Facts and figures aside, the original \\"Batman\\" film revolutionized the way that films were made in regards to scale, merchandising, and certainly publicity. The fueling monster of Warner Brothers garnered record deals with Prince for soundtrack options and locked away square merchandising deals for an infinite amount of Batman paraphernalia. Its near-$40 million budget (unheard of for 1989) was immediately returned in its opening weekend gross, all fueled by the massive media and publicity frenzy woven around this landmark blockbuster film. To that end, it is no surprise that Warner Brothers finally released a worthy DVD complement to the effort that went into the original production of their film. And thus begins the review of the newly-released 2-disc Special Edition of Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\"...<br /><br />THE PACKAGE:<br /><br />Coordinated beautifully with the DVD release of \\"Batman Begins\\", the original \\"Batman\\" and subsequent Batman DVDs look fantastic. Each DVD case features a brand new metallic type font of the title with the short list of the casts running just above it. The \\"Batman\\" cover features the glistening Batman logo in its full glory (not clipped at the wings like previous VHS and DVD formats.) A textured metallic frame also surrounds the front face. A comprehensive list of the special features on disc 2 of the collection appears on the back cover with several brief descriptions of each segment's content. The discs themselves are fantastically laid out, each featuring newly-formed collage art from the film. Disc 2 displays the classic image of Batman violently gripping the Joker's suit jacket in the film's climax in Gotham Cathedral. One drawback of this particular edition is that it does not feature an inlet, booklet, or leaflet of any kind in its inside cover. Where many viewers like the guide to the film's chapters, I feel that this mistake is easily forgivable once we are compensated by the discs' features.<br /><br />THE LOOK AND SOUND:<br /><br />The widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio captures practically everything Burton shot in '89. Dolby 5.1 and DTS Surround ensure that every unique sound effect in the film is heard perfectly. Essentially, the transfer is just as affective as the previous bare-bones \\"Batman\\" DVD release with the only notable changes being a slightly thinner 16:9 ration instead of the previous 1.85:1 and the inclusion of the new DTS Surround Sound factor. The digital transfer crystallizes every single visual effect and brings Gotham City into its full glory during every sweeping master shot.<br /><br />THE EXTRAS:<br /><br />This is where the true magic lies in this edition. Five extra gallery features translate to over 20 featurettes ranging from 5 to 35 minutes in length. The gem of them all is a marvelous half-hour documentary on the evolution of the Batman lore from its inception in 1939 to its reinvention for film in 1989 and beyond. \\"Legends of the Dark Knight - The History of Batman\\" features many prominent comic book icons such as Stan Lee, Kevin Smith, and Bob Kane himself, all creating fantastic insight into the psyche and appeal of the Caped Crusader. Also featured are several extremely relevant Batman writers and artists who are responsible for thrusting the Dark Knight into a more contemporary context for several generations. Among them are Dennis O'Neil, Neal Adams, and THE Frank Miller. A strongpoint of the documentary is its choice to focus predominantly on the evolution of the CHARACTER of Batman as opposed to getting bogged down into discussing the 40's serials, the 60's television series catastrophe, and even the later films themselves. Narrated by Mr. Mark Hamill, the documentary delves deep into the psychology of the Batman and his affect on America and vice versa.<br /><br />Shadows of the Bat - The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight\\", a three-part documentary showing the process to get Batman onto the big screen, is the second best feature of the second disc. The first 2 segments focus on pre-production for \\"Batman\\" with the last installment focusing on the principal photography and after effects of the film. The most remarkable thing about this documentary is that it features dozens of interviews with integral members of the cast and crew. Tim Burton is at the helm, giving the bulk of the information. Following closely behind are Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Billy Dee Williams, Pat Hingle, Michael Gough, Robert Wuhl, and even Mr. Jack Nicholson himself! Notorious for his privacy, Nicholson graciously supplies dozens of glorious minutes explaining his role in the process and even the psychosis of the Joker. The only one drawback to the documentary is the fact that Michael Keaton's interview is recycled footage from an old \\"Batman Return\\" behind-the-scenes program that ran on television in the early 90's. All other cast and crew interviews are brand new!<br /><br />Also on the special features menu is a \\"Beyond Batman\\" documentary gallery, housing 6 separate featurettes with subjects ranging from the production design of the film; to the creation of the batsuit, batmobile, and bat-gadgets; as well as the transformation of Jack Nicholson into the Joker among others. Each of these video bits, averaging around 13 minutes, expounds on the finer aspects of the production of the film. Truly an aspiring filmmakers dream, these featurettes hone in on what happens behind the camera in the art, sound, and script departments. The structural and architectural analysis of the design of Gotham City is especially fascinating to witness!<br /><br />Rounding out the second disc are three music videos by Prince, a lost Robin storyboard sequence, and a short clip of Bob Kane reflecting on his creation on the set of the original film. Short character bios contain more interviews that delve into specific characters in both the `heroes' and `villains' categories. When the ads stress \\"18 Hours of New Extras\\", the aren't joking around!<br /><br />In summation, the 2-disc Special Edition of \\"Batman\\" is a landmark DVD release of a great film. Each featurette reveals great insight into the lore of the Batman as well as the production of the first film. Thankfully, very little of the interview clips are repeated throughout different documentaries, giving each special feature a refreshingly unique feel. This DVD is a must-have for any Batman fan. The information is so comprehensive that you're guaranteed to walk away having learned something new you didn't know before.

B000000W5B|5.0|This Rolling Stones collection of songs has a strange melancolic feel in some of the songs as if were recorded during the winter. It has some very good hits: Angie, Heartbreaker and Star Star. But also, \\"Can you hear the music\\" is haunting as is \\"Hide your love\\" or \\"Winter\\". \\"Silver Train\\" should also been a hit (it was a \\"B\\" side). I like this record best as \\"Exile\\"...
6302878527|4.0|As a fan of Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney, this has always been a favorite movie so I finally bought the VHS for my library. The story is told in flashbacks which can be a bit confusing the first time you see it. TIP: remember what clothes they're wearing in each time period. It's the story of a couple who have been together for some years and success hasn't helped their relationship. They're wondering whether to stay together and remembering several stages in their relationship. It may take a few viewings to keep the story straight but I think it's well worth it. Good Henry Mancini score - although I wish a vocal version of the theme song had been included.
0141439831|3.0|I first read this book when I was in the eight grade in order to gain points for a school program called accelerated reader.  It took FOREVER to read this book, and althogh it is a very witty story, it is an increadibly long, and sometimes boring read as well.  I recently read it agian, and watched the movie too(Which I don't recomend to anyone, unless you are a fan of Reese Witherspoon or Legally Blond)and althouhg I found a lot more flavor in it, I had to literally put the book down for a long time and take a nap or eat a lot of sugar in order to continue.  But if you are like me and you feel you MUST read as many classics as you can, Vanity Fair is a must in your classics list.
B00000J2SQ|3.0|With Difficult to Cure, the rather limp and timid Rainbow release from a year previous, Rainbow entered the 1980's with the addition of couple young American hot shots with sites aimed on US radio.  With the more confident and blustery Straight Between the Eyes, Ritchie and Roger take that approach one step further with the addition of yet another talented young American.  Replaced this time is the irreplacable Don Airey (keyboards) with 20-year-old New Yorker David Rosenthal. And wonder of wonders, he may just turn out to be the best ivory-tickler this group has ever seen.  Yes folks, Rainbow had officially become a hard-rock hybrid, as now a couple of nearing-40 British legends combined with a trio of hungry 20-something Americans.  This combo may sound a bit contrived, but a solid and unique 80s rock sound is established.  A couple of minor later-day classics would also surface as a result. <br /> <br />Master Blackmore's laboratory of musicians here produces their one and only top 40 hit in the seductive, delicately played ballad \\"Stone Cold.\\"  But more significantly, SBTE signifies a willingness to experiment with various rock stylings.  From the galloping rocker \\"Death Alley Driver,\\" complete with a synth-lead solo, to the bubbling blues-rock of the naughty \\"Tite Squeeze,\\"  to the familiar epic goth-rocker \\"Eyes of Fire,\\"  it's all represented and done so convincingly.  Roger Glover adds his arsenal of then modern effects over many of these offerings, making this one polished yet tough Rainbow outing. Also of note, Joe Lynn Turner's sometimes overly polite vocal style was beefed up considerably over DTC.  They'd be back to slightly switch gears (and drummers) in '83 with the Journey-like Bent out of Shape which would later dissolve into shades of a renewed Purple.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Let me begin to say that I have been a big fan of Rage Against The Machine for quite sometime (for about eight or nine years, way before they broke up).  I just never had the chance to purchase their albums.  But when I hear their music on the radio, I always stop what I'm doing and focus my attention on the track that's playing.  They are without a doubt one of my favorite groups musically period.  They might not have been the first, but were one of the pioneers in fusing rock and rap (rock style and beats with rap lyrics).  They were Linkin Park somewhat before Linkin Park, although they're sounds and style differ in ways as well (Linkin Park, another one of my favorite rock groups).  That's why they appeal to me so much and that they have something to say and stand for.  Also, they want the world to hear and feel it through their rage (no pun intended) and passion, something a lot of musicians these days can take a lesson from.  When I finally got a chance to buy The Battle Of Los Angeles, I had pretty much heard like half the CD from the radio or people I hang with.  Songs like Testify, Guerilla Radio, Calm Like A Bomb, Mic Check, and Sleep Now In The Fire.  But to hear it all put together and hear the total package was amazing.  Just like they are one of my favorite music groups of all time, this CD is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I can't figure out why this doesn't get more credit for being one of the better albums out in the last decade or so.  This album still resonates today to me now in 2005.  With the way the world is and what we are seeing, we should be standing up and saying that this sh*t is wrong like the point they're trying to get across in the song Testify (one of my favorite tracks of theirs).  Then go from that into Guerilla Radio which refers to takeover of the airwaves bumrush-style and getting the real news/side/perspective across for everyone to see.  Calm Like A Bomb is one of the best tracks ever!  What is a bomb before it explodes?  Calm, right!  That's the way people are that get stepped on by the government or at least that is what it seems.  But underneath there is a build-up and the bomb (i.e. people) are waiting to explode.  Mic Check was a great track and Sleep Now In the Fire was my favorite track when it first came out as a single around late '99-early '00.  Born Of A Broken Man, great as well.  Born As Ghosts has a great point to it.  People of minorities are born as ghosts in a way cause our voices fall on death ears to people that have the power most of the time as if we are on a different side from them (similar to ghosts being detached from the real world).  It's like they don't or won't hear us.  Maria fits in great into the album.  Voice of The Voiceless is them saying that they are stepping up as the lead voice of the rest of the oppressed people.  Great line Zack made at the end of one of the verses,\\"Panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free!\\"  The CD finishes off great with New Millenium Homes, Ashes In the Fall (new sound just like the old sound- meaning what their (i.e. the gov't) are saying now is just what they were saying then with just a different face/surface to it.  Therefore, you need to look deeper and beyond face value in my words.), and War Within A Breath.  Every breath could be that next step into war for freedom and equality if we ever finally decide to step up and do something about it.  This 45 minutes of music has to be some of the greatest material ever made.  I'm not a rock instrument expert, but I must say that they sounded so ill!  Zack's lyrics were so powerful and the emotion he poured into them was simply heart-racing.  Makes you want to declare war yourself.  It's just sad that this group broke up.  I remember hearing about that my freshman year in college, and I was like things will never be the same.  Thank goodness Linkin Park came around for me.  But there still feels like there is a hole missing.  If Rage was still around, there'sno telling what they could have achieved.  Off that, this is a must have CD.  Even is you are not a hardcore rock fan, this is an album that if you ever felt is if you have been kept down, controlled or blocked off from something you felt you had a right to or maybe couldn't say want you want to say and made to feel as if your mind was a minority as well as you being one by your skin color, this is one you feel in my opinion.  If there ever was a rock group that could represent the 'hood, Rage Against The Machine was (and still is) it!  Along with not just the 'hood but lower-class neighborhoods in general no matter what skin color.  I only can hold out hope that they would ever bring it back together and re-emerge.  But I thank them for this album.  Battle Of Los Angeles (and the world) lives on (til there's really freedom)!

It also contains some of the best performances ever put into a summer blockbuster. Everything as large as a brachiosaurus and small as a little hand gesture are finely crafted by everyone involved into perfection.<br /><br />It's a movie that shall never go extinct.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B000AL730O|4.0|The fact that this is McCartney's best album since 1997's \\"Flaming Pie\\" is largely thanks to producer Nigel Goodrich, who aparently has a keen knack for making careful, thoughtful sonic decisions that he may have learned at the school of old Beatles recordings. It was Goodrich who encouraged Paul to play most of the instruments on this album himself, showcasing McCartney's outstanding natural talents but also investing the artist emotionally in every nuance of the work. At 63, Paul still has a good singing voice and his songwriting is still up to snuff; \\"Jenny Wren\\" is one of the prettiest songs in years. Its mournful duduk solo (an indian oboe) reminds us that there are still many interesting sound explorations possible in this world, as do the tape loops on \\"How Kind of You\\" and other tastefully applied recording touches.  \\"English Tea\\" is masterfully done, a ditty that is both a parody of Englishness and an affectionate embrace of it. \\"Too Much Rain\\" features another melody that will haunt the listener for days. \\"At the Mercy\\" brings more examples of careful sonic choices, when a grand musical moment arrives on heavily delayed electric guitars. Expert string arrangements punctuate the entire album, and \\"Anyway\\" has a brilliant majesty about it. The only reason I don't give this album five stars is that not enough of its lyrics are memorable; they don't provide that many concrete images to hang our hats on. But they are competent and I recommend this album as a good example of how careful production can help raise a track from the commonplace to the remarkable.
B00003CXGP|5.0|There has been a great debate over this movie's being classified as horror or comedy.  It is grusome, horrible and gory, but at the same time oddly cute at times.  It portrays a period in time and a certain mentality, but at the same time transcends to present day.    Patrick Bateman is the yuppie scum we grew to hate: arrogant, materialistic, and self serving.  Yet, at the same time while being psychotic, he longs for substance.  He seeks it out in friends, job and social life, and finds nothing.  Instead he becomes obsessed with the most trivial of insignifigant things (ex. designer clothes), going so far as to obsess over the subtle watermarks on a business card.  His friends and aquaintance are so shallow they confuse him with someone else and he's happy to play into it.  Why shouldn't he?  No one knows the difference or takes the time out to realize it.  Maybe this is more a comment on our culture despite the yuppie / 80s backdrop.  People really are not all that concerned with more than themselves.  Perhaps none of us have true friends, it's all an illusion.  I believe that, I believe a lot of that to be true.    One of the oddest things I found about this movie was Patrick's relationship with his girlfriend.  While she is just as shallow and rude as the others, she has an odd hold over him that no one else seems to.  He doesn't exactly follow her orders, but she seems to have almost a mothering effect on him.  Patrick seems almost afraid of her, and when he finally ends the relationship he almost apologizes when he takes joy in hurting others.    Many people were angry about the sex scenes.  If anything they were just ridiculous (how about that scene of him flexing and posturing before the mirror with those two hookers while playing Phil Collins songs?!).  Want a real horror story, read the book.  It's disturbing, but then again that's the point of the movie.
B0007RQKXC|5.0|A man is dead, a woman was raped, and that's all that can be definitely said. Somebody has committed murder, but nobody knows whodunnit.<br /><br />Legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's \\"Rashomon\\" is a classic for its skillful direction, suspense and wonderful acting. It's one of those movies you think must be vastly overrated until you see it, and are blown away by it.<br /><br />At the Rashomon Gate in eleventh-century Japan, a man (Kichijiro Ueda) takes shelter with a priest (Minoru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) during a rainstorm. The woodcutter is depressed and the priest is horrified, over a recent crime: the vicious bandit Tajômaru (Toshirô Mifune) was arrested for murdering a man named Takehiro (Masayuki Mori) and raping his wife Masako (Machiko Kyô). But when taken before the police, Tajômaru claims that he had his fun with the woman and killed her husband honorably in a fight.<br /><br />But Masako begs to differ; she claims to be the victim first of the sadistic bandit, then of her cold-hearted husband, whom she says she stabbed. And when a medium calls up the spirit of Takehiro, he claims that Masako was unfaithful, asking the bandit to murder him, then spurned by Tajômaru. Her actions drove Takehiro to suicide. But the woodcutter himself claims to have seen the altercation -- and his version is wildly different from them all.<br /><br />During the filming of \\"Rashomon,\\" director Akira Kurosawa stated that the film is a reflection of life, which doesn't always have clear meanings.  The same could be said of truth. Questions are raised by the events of \\"Rashomon,\\" but given no easy answers -- sometimes no answers at all (my biggest question was how Masako's gown stays so white if she's always weeping on the ground).<br /><br />Light and shadow whirl and dance in a frankly beautiful woodland setting, serving as a pretty backdrop for some very ugly acts. The fight scenes are masterful -- they look like real fights, as opposed to choreography. Tajômaru's are more stylized, whereas the woodcutter sees two guys rolling and staggering around with swords, obviously freaked out. Kurosawa was even brave enough to touch on the unique idea of having the deceased testify. The spinechilling seance scene, starring a downright spooky, stark-faced Fumiko Honma, is a haunting classic scene.<br /><br />Are Kurosawa's insights dark and depressing? In a fascinating, hypnotic way... yes. But while calmly pointing out the ability of human beings to lie even to themselves, he acknowledges that there's good in there too, by including a scene where the woodcutter adopts an abandoned baby. We lose our illusions and innocence as the priest loses his, forced to look on how despicable people can be, but while being comforted with the knowledge that people aren't all bad, and that unadulterated truth isn't really necessary to have good in you.<br /><br />Toshirô Mifune chews the scenery with gusto as the barbarian bandit, laughing and jerking like a hyena just to see people jump. At first glance, Machiko Kyô seems to be overacting, until you see how unhinged her character has become by whatever happened. Masayuki Mori doesn't get to act as much as the others (the poor guy spends most of his time tied to a tree), but is good when the camera zooms in on him. Minoru Chiaki and Takashi Shimura add an extra dimension as the innocent young priest and the tormented woodcutter.<br /><br />Gloomy, thought-provoking and ultimately quite freaky, \\"Rashomon\\" still defies conventional filmmaking, brilliantly crafted and exceptionally directed.

B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was very close to the book. A few missing scenes here and there, but a very good likeness. The actors were well picked. However ... notice that the movies basically follows this equation.<br /><br />1. Harry down and out<br /><br />2. Harry does something vaguely heroic, and is surrounded by cheering children.<br /><br />3. Again Harry finds himself down and out.<br /><br />4. Harry does something vaguely heroic, and is surrounded by cheering children.<br /><br />...Eh heb, Repeat.<br /><br />The movie although visually wonderful ... it leaves you with that \\"equation\\" that gets old, only if you don't find it somewhat funny. I enjoyed the movie though it does have that Spielbergian specticle to it. I wish this review wasn't possibly viewed by children, because I would have a field day with this film ... although I liked it. Sheesh, I sound like Dumbledor.
078401213X|4.0|Pi is a low-budget film that was shot in black and white. The stark, imaginative photography is great. It's easy to see why director Darren Aronofsky won the \\"Best Director\\" award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. Film art buffs will appreciate Aronofsky's work on this flick.<br /><br />Pi is an eccentric tale to say the least. Unlikely hero Max Cohen is an oddball mathematics genius who is studying the possible existence of detectable patterns in the stock market. Using his amazing homemade supercomputer, Max stumbles upon a bug that crashes his system and spits out a worthless number. However, Max becomes obsessed with the number and finding its potential meaning. A Hasidic sect and members of an extremely influential Wall Street firm hear about Max's number and want it for their own immoral purposes.<br /><br />The story is fascinating and Aronofsky creates an air of urgency and suspense that draws the audience in. The subject matter is not the stuff of blockbusters and you will not find glamorous stars, so this film may not be for everyone. If you're a fan of the unusual or a follower of cult classics, then I highly recommend this film.
B0009JAENU|4.0|This CD contains the most representative sonatas for violin and piano by the great master. It is apt to issue this number during the year's celebration for Mozart's great life and the unimaginable richness in his musical legacy to the posterity. These pieces are unlike Papa Haydn's violin sonatas, in which the violin only plays a secondary role and most of the melodies are on the keyboard. Mozart innovated the genre and elevated the status of violin in the sense that both instruments are partners, with no dominance between the two. Any commentary on the music here will be unnecessary and extraneous since Mozart's masterworks speak for themselves, especially in this CD. Anyone with sense of beauty and symmetry will appreciate it. <br /> <br />Both Ms. Hahn and Ms. Zhu are up to the task in the performance, which is impassioned but with proper reserve and mannerism befitting the \\"Age of Enlightenment\\". Namely, it is a rendition with poise and restrain imposed by reason.  The execution of passage works is flawless and crystal clean for both performers. <br /> <br />The only flaw, seems to me, is that violin part is too loud when piano has the theme melodies. I doubt Ms. Hahn, as a seasoned player, would commit such mistake, therefore, it is reasonable to attribute this dissonance in an otherwise perfect achievement to acoustic in the recording session. <br /> <br />
B00005JNQA|3.0|Nice set-up about an interpreter in the UN overhearing African  coup attempt and inclusion of awareness about genocide, but a fairly predictable script.  Some intelligent moments and twists,  but also a fairly predictable parallel relation between Kidman  and Penn, and a bit too many sad eyed scenes.  The audience  could guess a lot of what is to happen, and Penn's opening scene where he drops his wedding band into an empty booze glass  is nice symbolism, but really gives away easily everything about this character.  Ending a bit melodramatic.  Take a pass unless you're bored.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|she has a beautiful voice she has beautiful songs and as much as i hate to say it fans of Tori Amos will find it a welcome addition to there collection she is like a less angsty Carina Round <br />
B000089CJI|5.0|A friend lent me this CD,and I can't stop playing it! Perfect for listening to driving at night. <br />I can only describe them as a cocktail of Prefab Sprout,Mercury Rev and Human League! <br />Haven't heard any of their earlier incarnations but I'll be working on that!
B000088E6D|5.0|This singer has a refreshingly strong vibrant voice. Every tune on the CD is a keeper. I wish I had bought it sooner.
B00004Y6Q5|3.0|Kronos Quartet is amazing as usual. Summer is fun, fall starts to get a little sad-feeling, and Winter strait makes you want to kill yourself. Not good-to-fall-asleep-to-kind-of-music, but a good CD nonetheless.
B000B2YQX4|1.0|I'm SO disappointed with this album.  However, I haven't liked a DM album since Songs of Faith and Devotion (Mercy in You, Walking in My Shoes, Higher Love, Rush, In Your Room..)   <br /> <br />Sparse melodies <br /> <br />Continual monotone basslines (with the most flat, uninteresting keyboard sounds) <br /> <br />Lots of sound effects <br /> <br />Lots of noise <br /> <br />Hardly any drum beats. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by the \\"planted\\" reviews here.  The positive reviews of this album sound like the record company trying to fill up this review area and counter-act what the people are saying. <br /> <br />The fans who miss Alan Wilder, are into the \\"Black Celebration to Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" era, and like music and melody over noise are absolutely correct. <br /> <br />Sad sad day it was yesterday.  :( <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I know this is long and looks discouraging to read, but please do, I believe I have made some valid points. <br /> <br />I have to admit, I can't say I was a true Green Day fan until American Idiot came out.  Sure, I knew a few old songs but not enough to call myself a fan.  However, since the release of American Idiot, I have gotten into everything of theirs, old and new.  And I love it all.  Perhaps mainly because each cd is a lot different from it's predecessor; it's hard to get bored with Green Day.  I realize that many are unhappy because it's not like Dookie.  It's not meant to be.  Both Dookie and American Idiot are brilliant in their own, unique ways.  Green Day took a big risk releasing this album and you know what?  It paid off.  I've read many reviews that state that they just made this album for the money.  Green Day has never been in it for the money.  If they were, they would have quit long ago.  They do this for the fans, and for their love of music. <br />This album has indeed taken a step away from the \\"punk\\" scene and stepped into the more mainstream stuff, but does that mean that they've taken a step back in their career?  Of course not.  In fact, I believe this is a big step forward that shows their maturity and wisdom as veterans in the field of music.  Green Day has been around for over 17 years now and you can't say that about a lot of bands these days. <br />American Idiot is not just another fad in the mainstream style: this album has been in the top 10 sellers list since it came out in September of 2004.  How many artists have been able to achieve that, especially now, where every other minute someone new is coming out? <br />I admit, Boulevard of Broken Dreams has been played to the point of exhaustion, and Wake Me Up When September ends is heading in the same direction.  But Green Day can't help that.  The commercializing is all within the media industry. <br /> <br />As for the actual album itself, each song is packed with exploding, in-your-face lyrics, amazing vocals, stunning guitar riffs and you can't forget about Mike's incredible basswork or Tre's fantastic drumming abilities. <br />Yes, there is a left wing political bias, but the album is about so much more than just politics.  The entire album is a rock opera with a meaning that is left up to the listener to discover on their own. <br />1. American Idiot - I think this song is extremely underrated.  It exploded as the first single but after that it kind of disappeared.  It's very pumped, musically and lyrically. <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia - I love this song, the transitions really bring 5 separate songs into one powerful one. <br />I.Jesus of Suburbia - This first section brings the introduction of the first character of the opera, Jesus, the protagonist, \\"the anti-hero\\" as described by Billie Joe  <br />II.City of the Damned - This part of the song kind of sets the mood for the rest of this song, and the rest of the album. <br />III.I Don't Care - Very in-your-face part of the song, there was definitely no holding back when the lyrics were written. <br />IV.Dearly Beloved - I like this part of the song.  It asks many questions, questions which get you thinking. <br />V.Tales from another broken home - Love the piano solo towards the end. <br />3.Holiday - This is beginning to become a little overplayed, but it hasn't reached a point for me yet where I want to skip this song while listening to the cd.  It's a powerful song: powerful lyrics, guitar, everything. <br />4.Boulevard of Broken Dreams - I've gotten a bit sick of this song simply because it's been overplayed.  But I can see why, it is a very good song that I think many can relate to.  For those who aren't tired of it yet, it's an excellent song. <br />5.Are We The Waiting? - This song definitely shows of Billie Joe's vocal abilities and with beautiful lyrics. <br />6.St. Jimmy - A very charged song, one of my favorites, introduces St. Jimmy, a self-destructing kind of character. <br />7.Give Me Novacaine - Another song that's very revolved around Billie Joe's vocals, along with accenting guitar riffs. <br />8.She's a Rebel - Here is the introduction of the final character, Whatsername. \\"She's kind of Saint Jimmy's nemesis in a lot of ways,\\" says Armstrong. \\"The constant theme of the record is 'rage versus love.'\\"  Overall a pretty good, fast-paced song. (Guitar Legends Magazine) <br />9.Extraordinary Girl - This song kind of slows it down a bit as it gives a little more about Whatsername.  I like the song, but it's not the best.  The best thing in it are the lyrics. <br />10.Letterbomb - I really liked this song because it's fast paced yet contains lyrics that really make you think \\"Where will all the martyrs go when the virus kills itself and where will we all go when it's too late?\\" is one of my favorite lines off the entire album <br />11.Wake Me Up When September Ends - Very touching song about the death of Billie Joe's father, yet the song still ties into the story of the rest of the album. <br />12.Homecoming - I love this other 9 minute song. Again, great transitions <br />I.The Death of St Jimmy - St. Jimmy's suicide kinda makes you stop and go \\"what?\\".  It makes you wonder what just happened, and why.  The lyrics leading up to it are \\"inspiring\\" for lack of a better word. <br />II.East 12th street - I really like this part of the song, the music, the lyrics, everything. <br />III.Nobody Likes You - Here's a little taste for Mike's vocals, the piece that was the foundation of Homecoming <br />IV. Rock and Roll Girlfriend - As sung by Tre, it's kind of a comedic relief that puts a break in with the rest of the story <br />V.We're Coming Home Again - Perfect way to end this amazing song, very well done. <br />13.Whatsername- Personally, this is my favorite song off the album.  It's not the best musically, but the lyrics get to me every single time.  Very thought provoking song, one that leaves you hanging and wishing for more. <br />Inconclusion, I recommend this album 110%, and even more so, I recommend seeing Green Day live if you ever get the chance.  I recently saw them and was just blown away.  They are so full of energy and you can tell that they love what they do so I would pay any price to see them again.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I've been listening to Depeche Mode since 1985, and I own almost everything that they've put out.  I was a bit disappointed at first, because I had built my hopes up on \\"Precious\\", which I feel is an outstanding song, one of the best they've put out in my opinion.  As many have said, this album takes a few listens to start growing on you, much like Exciter did.  There are a couple of songs I can live without and a few lyrics lurking in a couple of other songs that make me cringe in their lack of imagination, otherwise this album would get 4 or maybe even 5 stars. <br /> <br />I almost gave it 4 stars just because I'm so thrilled that they're still putting out albums after all these years!  This one won't be my favorite, but it's certainly not my least favorite DM album.  I think it will find its place somewhere in the upper 20% though.....
B00005JNSK|5.0|When WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY was released in 1971, Ronald Dahl, the author who wrote the original story, was horrified. The filmmakers had taken Dahl's script (based on his own story) and butchered it to pieces under the writing revisions of David Seltzer. In fact, Dahl was so upset that he never allowed the studio to make a planned sequel that was to be loosely based upon CHARLIE AND THE GLASS ELEVATOR.  Fast forward a little over 30 years to a Hollywood that has lost all creative juices and is in a makeover frenzy. Warner Brothers hasn't had very many family hits in awhile and family films are bringing in more moolah than ever before.  So, why not remake CHARLIE? Kids who grew up with the original are full of nostalgia now and will see it with their own children. Put Tim Burton at the helm to direct because he's the only director who's crazy enough to get the okay from the Dahl estate and you've got an instant success on your hands.<br /><br />CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a quite different movie from WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Just look at the title of the two films for starters. Whereas WILLY was drenched in this fairy-tale optimism detached from reality (and from much of Dahl's original story), CHARLIE is full of the dark humor characteristic of everyday life (and of Dahl's original story).<br /><br />The plot of the film is rather familiar.  World-renown, but never-seen candy-maker, Willy Wonka makes it known that he is going to open his factory to 5 lucky children who can find a Golden Ticket. Through some coincidences (or Providence), Charlie Bucket finds one of the tickets. He and his grandpa and the other 4 children and their adult guardians are given a tour of Willy Wonka's wonderful factory. But one by one, the children fall to the vices they are most prey.  Until only Charlie is left. As the last child remaining, Charlie wins a very special prize, but one that comes with a price that Charlie isn't worth paying. But in the end, it all turns out fine.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is amazing as Wonka. His portrayal is quite different from Gene Wilder's, but full of the suspect-sinister that Dahl's story version contains.  Freddie Highmore portrays Charlie and this youngster has Oscar written all over him; one shouldn't be surprised if he takes an Award by the time he's 15 (Haley Joel Osmont hasn't got a thing on Highmore).  The other actors do a fine job, though I especially enjoyed Miss Pyle portraying Mrs. Beauregarde--she brings the character to life, making her a woman to die for. Other performance of note is that of Deep Roy. This little Indian portrays all of the Oompa Loompas and despite CGI effects, actually portrayed each one of the 150+ tiny humans (he also received a nice million dollar salary for his work).<br /><br />Musically, this version of the story is quite different than the 1971.  The songs include Dahl's original lyrics and each song is written in a different genre of music, from pop to rock to reggae to country. Instead of the repetition that the 1971's songs, this approach provides a different tone and thus signifying a different lesson for each of the incidents they follow.<br /><br />Overall, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a delightful romp through imagination. The youngest of viewers might be frightened by some of the images (but like the original fairy tales, they should be) and fans of the 1971 movie might be prejudiced by the new take. However, this version of Ronald Dahl's story is closer to the source and spirit of the original story and for that, I think it's a tad bit better.n the end, it all turns out fine. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp is amazing as Wonka.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|It took a long 8 years but it was worth the wait. Batman Begins was everything that the first film should have been. Even though I prefer the first slightly better, this movie comes a very close second. The tone of the film is serious but not too serious. The film has it's dark moments but it is nowhere near as dark as \\"Returns.\\" It's awesome to see Bruce evolve into the Batman right before our eyes and finally establish himself as the saviour of gotham. Can't wait to see the next movie with The Joker. Let the new Bat-Era begin!!
B000AARKOO|5.0|Ridley Scott's masterful follow-up to \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", is, certainly, the best film about the Crusades ever made. While this may seem faint praise about an era far removed from ours, his vision offers an honesty and timeliness that clearly illustrates how little has changed in the last thousand years. With remarkable fidelity to actual characters and events, \\"Kingdom\\" reminds viewers that goodness is not only a Christian attribute (Ghassan Massoud's Saladin is far more sympathetic and compassionate than many 'holy' Crusaders), that even an average man, given purpose, can change the world (Orlando Bloom's Balian, a grieving blacksmith, discovers his father is a Baron, embraces the code of chivalry, and ultimately saves Jerusalem from total destruction), and that religious atrocities \\"in the name of God\\" was as ridiculous then as it is, today.<br /><br />While there are many historical inaccuracies, for cinematic purposes (Godfrey and Balian were not related, Balian did not have a love affair with Sibylla, etc.), director Scott unflinchingly shows much that was true (Jerusalem's 'King' Baldwin...a masked Edward Norton...dying from leprosy; the horrific siege of the city), and fills the screen with such detail that the film demands repeated viewings, to truly appreciate the spectacle.<br /><br />Several performances deserve mention; Orlando Bloom is very good as the central character, Balian, in certainly his best performance to date; Brendan Gleeson, as the bigoted Reynald, makes the character nearly as unsavory as the ACTUAL Reynald; Jeremy Irons is wonderful as the fictional Tiberias (based on the historic Raymond of Cyprus...Tiberias DOES have a nobler ring!), and Liam Neeson, in a role FAR too brief, gives Godfrey both humanity and nobility (although he seems to be making a career of playing hero's mentors!)<br /><br />The DVD offers a variety of terrific extras, including detailed technical information about the production (filmed in Spain and Morocco), and an overview of the Crusades, and the period of the film, with special attention paid to where the film makers diverged from historic fact.<br /><br />This is a two-disc set that certainly lives up to expectations! Any Ridley Scott film is worth owning...\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" stands as one of his best, so need I say more?and Morocco), and an overview of the Crusades, and the period of the film, with special attention paid to where the film makers diverged from historic fact. <br /> <br />This is a two-disc set that certainly lives up to expectations!

B00005JO0J|5.0|It's a purely wonderful movie if you love the TV series, and still excellent science fiction/action/Western even if you haven't seen Firefly on TV.  You may want to have a look at the review written by the famed author of Ender's Game and numerous other sci-fi and fantasy novels, Orson Scott Card - he was pretty well knocked out by Serenity. <br /> <br />One other note - someone from Kansas has been posting multiple derogatory reviews of Whedon's stuff and raves of all the Star Wars prequels (I-III).  As they said in Oz: \\"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.\\"
B000B2YQX4|5.0|\\"Playing the Angel\\" is a complete Depeche Mode album.  I mean in the sense that Black Celebration and Violator are also complete Depeche Mode albums.  The pacing, the lyrics, the melodies, the instrumentation, and the performances all work together not for individual beauty, but for collective continuity.  I am truly ecstatic at the work this band has produced here.  The songs range from bombastic electro beasts to quiet synth induced catharsis.  But they all work together as such a cohesive album, that it truly does take a few listens to really appreciate it. <br /> <br />Thank you Depeche Mode for such a wonderful album, it is certainly appreciated by your fans.
0767830555|5.0|Martin Scorsese points out in the documentary on the 1999 \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD of 1976's \\"Taxi Driver\\" that he didn't feel the movie would necessarily speak to a large audience, and yet that it was a film that he really had to do, and I say more power to him.  \\"Taxi Driver\\" is more than just a great movie, it's frighteningly real and incredibly powerful.   <br /> <br />Anyone who tells you that this movie is boring or that it meanders is horrendously missing the point.  This is an incredibly well-realized movie, masterfully paced, and evocative.  There is some great black humor in \\"Taxi Driver\\", but its primary impact is psychological, and in turn, emotional.  The movie tends to be very low-key, but in a continuously arrestingly and usually creepy way.  A ton of the credit for this of course goes to Robert De Niro for his incredible lead performance as the crippingly lonely cabbie Travis Bickle, a man of contrasts who's disturbed to the very core of his being.  Seeing Iris, a 12-year-old prostitute remarkably portrayed by Jodie Foster, ultimately pushes Bickle to the very brink.  The movie's post-shootout finale, which I agree is clearly a fantasy from Bickle's mind, is a hauntingly powerful stroke of genius. <br /> <br />The casting is amazing all around.  Harvey Keitel is right in his element, with a terrific performance as Sport, aka \\"the pimp\\".  Peter Boyle is great as the so-called \\"Wizard\\", Albert Brooks adds some lighthearted humor to the proceedings where appropriate, and the wonderful Cybill Shepherd is as mesmerizing as ever.  Even Martin Scorsese is absolutely brilliant filling in a bit part as a homicidal passenger in Travis' cab. <br /> <br />\\"Taxi Driver\\" additionally hints at Scorsese's excellent musical taste by using Jackson Browne's \\"Late For The Sky\\" in the soundtrack.  The song's appearance in the film is a little jarring, but quite fitting, and it IS one of the best songs ever written. <br /> <br />The making-of documentary featured in the1999 \\"Collector's Edition\\" is highly worthwhile, containing interview segments from Scorsese, De Niro, Shepherd, Boyle, Foster, Keitel, Brooks, Schrader, etc., providing fascinating insight.  It becomes apparent that the essence of Paul Schrader's screenplay was at once captured while also being appropriately flashed out thanks to Scorsese and the incredibly talented actors.  The movie itself has been remastered, and the sound and picture quality are pristine. <br /> <br />If you don't have it already, this \\"Collector's Edition\\" is the way to go.  \\"Taxi Driver\\" deserves to be hailed as one of the very best movies ever, and any serious viewer should appreciate it.
0060574216|2.0|When I first began reading this book, it seemed alright, and to offer some helpful advice. (I was reading it for my college freshmen writing class) Now that I've finished it, I just wanted to say that I really don't like this book, I found it ridiculously sexist, and the author tends to be repetitive in what he says. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B000AP2ZLC|4.0|Finally we get the new Cryptopsy cd from the Canadian grinders.  The music is as fast and heavy as the rest of their cd's.  The big question is how does original vocalist Lord Worm sound, since not singing for quite some time?  He still rages.  His piercing screams are still evident and he sounds great on this.  I do miss DeSalvo's vocal style, because he had an extremely aggressive/pissed off sound that I felt gave the band a little extra oomph, over other bands w/typical death metal singers.  But at least Lord Worm is back and not some hack.   Flo's drumming is mind boggling on this and the double bass sound is damn thunderous your speakers will almost crumble.  However the drum sound is way too upfront in the mix.  This unfortunatly drowns out the rest of the instruments during the real chaotic fast parts, which there are plenty of, rest assured the band had not wimped out.  When the slower parts come chugging along they are some of the best parts of the cd because all the instruments can be heard clearly and this makes the music sound pretty frickin' heavy.  The wacky bass parts are back and the band has kinda went back to recapture a sound similar to their first 2 cd's.  I just wish the production was better, it would have made the 5 yr. wait a little more worth it.  The cd is available as a regular jewel case or limited edition digipack.  Anyway if you have always liked the band you will no doubt enjoy this, it is extremely powerful!
B000AL730O|5.0|I've always enjoyed Flowers In The Dirt because of its mature, warm intimacy.  This album does more of the same, only in a singer/songwriter mode.  I'm always hoping that Paul will deliver, but I'm amazed at how much this album keeps moving me with its different emotions. <br /> <br />Only one thing keeps this album from being absolutely perfect... <br /> <br />After the apparently last song on the album (Anyway), there's a short pause followed by a grinding, faceless instrumental that goes against the grain of the rest of the album.  I have to always remind myself to manually turn off the CD, or this instrumental becomes my last impression of this pleasurable listening experience.  It's not even it's own track, so you can't block it out by removing it from the playlist. <br /> <br />If anyone knows why Paul added this music, please tell us.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I am 50 years old and have been a Batnan fan all of my life. After many years of disapointment in Batman the TV series and the other Batman movies because of silly villains that turned the Dark Knight into a joke, \\"Batman Begins\\" finally gets serious. The Dark Knight is finally a believable superhero. I certainly hope that he stays this way.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|It falls flat after a few listens. The melodies and complexity of arrangements/sounds just aren't there. Even Ultra and Exciter seem to offer something new upon each listening even years later. For a great album, get New Order's \\"Waiting for the Siren's Call\\" This is how a band should should sound 25 years later.
B00004R7TP|5.0|I didn't listen to this record when it came out.... but as the 80's recede into the distance the real peaks of the decade rear up, and this is one of them.  Tori Amos et al. are of course unthinkable without this record, but I hear traces of this record throughout a lot of rock (especially down the Muse/Radiohead/Nigel Godrich end of the spectrum, but, hello? Antony and the Johnsons - I swear, Kate and this album in particular are everywhere!). Bush just *is* in a very sweet spot here - prog. rock studio and musical virtuosity, singer-songwriter confessional intensity, and a bit of Brian Wilson pop smarts saving it all from being unbearable. Pointless going through all the songs - individually they're all v. good to great, but taken together they're magic. A seriously powerful record.
0156027321|5.0|A beautiful book, both a fun read and a masterful use of symbolism (some obvious and some subtle) to address a perennial existential and metaphysical question.   <br /> <br />One of the themes of the book - creation - becomes much clearer if you recognize the name of the Japanese cargo ship Tzimtzum. Tzimtzum is a Hebrew word found in Kabbalistic literature, and it refers to the contraction of divine energy into nothingness that precedes God's creation of the world. <br /> <br />In The Life of Pi, we first read about the inner and outer world of our teenager Pi.  Then, when the Tzimtzum sinks, the entire world contracts and Pi is lost at sea.  He starts over with almost nothing - animals, a few raw materials, and the ability to learn.  He tells the story of his survival, including a few twists that make both him and us readers doubt the entire story. <br /> <br />At the end of the book, when the scientifically minded Tzimtzum company representatives doubt the story he tells of his survival, he tells them an alternate story, asking them -- and us --  which we prefer to believe. <br /> <br />One is a stereotypically scientific story of survival through brutal competition and the other is a possibly allegorical story of survival through faith, learning, and interspecies communication.  Both contain unbelievable  elements.  But at the end of the book it's worth asking yourself which you are inclined to believe, and what that says about your view of human nature.
B00070Q8DQ|3.0|Sorry all you Behemoth fanatics, I just don't get the 'Behemoth is the best death metal band' tagline that seems to be popping up alot.  The band can play fast, no doubt about that and they are really talented to play this fast and sound so tight.  I just cannot get past the sound of the vocalist, it sounds like he swallowed the mic and he sounds muffled.  Sure I like my death metal brutal, but the singer is generic and very boring.  That is my main gripe about the band.  The other one is the lyrics-RIDICULOUS!  I am sick of the black metal type of lyrics that still saturate the scene.  It's not evil, guys, get over it already.  I mean these guys believe in this stuff, check out the thanks list.  They want to burn the world and destroy humanity, pathetic.  I think the band excels when they are playing slower.  The heavy parts really come through nicely and sound really heavy and brutal.  Just wish they would have stuck w/that formula a little more.  Anyway this is a good death metal release, I was just expecting a little more from all the hype surrounding this release.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Sorry, I like Amazon but why do I have to rate something that deseves 0 stars (if even that) 1 star?? Limp Bizkit is one of the worst things ever to exist in the whole universe. Seriously, they make clowns like Good Charlotte and My Chemical Romance look like Megadeth and Iced Earth for gods f****** sake! Fred Durst is possibly the WORST singer/songwriter ever, his lyrics are sooo dumb @$$ and don't get me started about his voice. Wes Boreland is maybe the WORST guitarist ever. Even a monkey can play better than this loser. He barely knows to play 10 notes, probably he can't even dream that he makes a solo! The drummer has off-tempo and slow beats, even I can drum better than him and I'm not even a drummer. The DJ... DJ is for trance and dance not for rock band wannabes (this is what LB is). The bassist is average at best, but who gives a f**k? 5 out of the 6 members are the worst they could be so the whole music sucks, end of story.  Anyway about the album, of course I didn't bought it, it is blasphemy to buy a LB album! But I got the 'My Way' Single as a bonus CD for Linkin Park's 'Hybrid Theory' 5 years ago (Linkin Park sucks as well, I was 11 back then and didn't knew good music), I decided to put it in the CD player last year and this is really a ripoff of Pink Floyd 'See Emily Play', and only 3 notes are played all the way... I'd might add! I also heard Rollin in one of the radios in school, I couldn't stand it so I took a knife and cutted the power cable.  LB is a generic lame overrated band. Anyone who likes them is not a real music fan. They are responsible for the nu-metal invasion, and they brought disgrace upon great talented rap/rock bands like Rage Against The Machine and Faith No More.  Bottom Line:  F**K LIMP BIZKIT AND IF YOU LIKE THEM SO F**K YOU TOO!

0307276902|5.0|I saw James's mother on Oprah and decided to buy this book...INCREDIBLE.  I could not put this book down. <br /> <br />Then ending left me hanging a bit.....I wanted to keep reading on and there were no more pages.  I was thrilled to find out \\"My Friend Leonard\\" is the sequel.  Needless to say; I ordered it the second I realized he had written the second book........I cant stop talking about this book! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007TKNII|5.0|Amazing movie - it really drew me into the story like very few movies do.  Top-notch acting, singing, sets, drama, the works.  I disagree with the previous review stating this movie is about a girl who couldn't love an \\"ugly-faced man\\" - I think it is more a story about the \\"ugly-faced man\\" and his struggle for love, recognition, and life. <br />Regardless of what themes you see in it, this is an excellent film, and I highly recommend it.  I wish I'd seen it in the theatre three times like another reviewer, but it still absolutely captivated me on home theatre.
B000001ED1|4.0|I don't know what made me pull this disc out last night but I did and listened to it from beginning to end.  I remember buying it on the strength of the first single, 'One of Us' and like most people, thought I'd get a helping of similar 'pop' tracks. Oh how wrong I was, thankfully!<br /><br />Joan's voice is unique in that on some tracks she growls soulfully and on others her voice sounds as smooth as silk.  I admit that as a self-proclaimed \\"r&b loving chick\\", I don't often give different types of music a chance but in the '90's, I did since I have an abundance of 'alternative' music in my collection.  I'm so glad that I have this disc in my collection because listening to it last night definitely took me back to a happier moment in my life and has definitely given me a greater appreciation for true artists & musicians who try to give us music fans a variety of music to listen to and not merely the \\"newest, latest\\" (it's a shame that so many cowardly bean counters run these labels now and that REALLY TALENTED artists are being forced to conform or driven out of the biz).<br /><br />My personal faves are: 'St. Teresa', 'Right Hand Man', 'Pensacola', 'One of Us', 'Ladder' & the absolutely beautiful: 'Crazy Baby'.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Forget the high school set up, this is the smartest, most mature and complex show to come out of network TV since the glory days of \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\", the early seasons of the \\"X-Files\\", \\"My So-Called Life\\" and the first season of \\"Twin Peaks\\". And sorry \\"Lost\\", you know I love you, but the Most Compelling Mystery On TV award goes to the cute-as-a-button petite blond with the smart mouth and the attitude. This is one of the few shows that are able to combine style and substance, drama and comedy and thrills, chills and character-driven stories successfully and intelligently. <br /> <br />Most every single episode is tightly packed with engaging storylines, crisp dialogue, fun mini-mysteries with outcomes that are hard to guess and tantalizing little clues that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat and intrigued by the season-long whodunit.  There is no fat, there are no fillers and there so much going on that even the awesome songs carefully selected for each scene serve a clear purpose.  <br /> <br />And every single episode reveals so much about the characters that you can't help but become emotionally attached. The writers and actors take great pains to make you care about all of the main people involved in Lilly's death and, in what may be one of the most brilliant moments in TV ever, in Lilly herself. Not one of them is your average, clichd teen show character and you may even find yourself loving AND hating some of these folks.  This is, after all, a gritty show that pushes the limit and never sugarcoats growing up, talks down to its viewers or romanticizes high school. The characters are real and flawed and their actions and motivations are not always noble or righteous. There's plenty of moral ambiguity, tough lessons and realism to go around.  <br /> <br />Likewise, the main character isn't some unrealistic, unattainable fembot or a flawless, impervious superhero. She is, we are often reminded, a hurt, lonely, vulnerable, scrawny 17-year-old who's only strengths are her unflinching determination, resilience and smarts. Bell is outstanding and subtly yet effectively conveys all the conflicting emotions with an endearing mixture of vulnerability, panache, wit and bravado that are all of her own. She is never a victim and she never screams for attention, yet she can always command it. By the third episode, you don't just like Veronica, you love and understand her.  <br /> <br />The relationship between Veronica and her dad is just beautiful and the chemistry between both actors undeniable. Jason Dohring is explosive as Logan Echolls and is another actor with great chemistry with Bell. Kudos are also in order to Francis Capra and the actress playing Lilly, who manages to steal every one of the few scenes she is in.  <br /> <br />Veronica Mars isn't your average TV mystery. There's so much more there than meets the eye. You can watch and re-watch the first season and always enjoy it and discover something new. Further more, it is fun and exciting TV, the kind we hardly ever get anymore outside of Cable. I'll take this over moguls looking for apprentices and desperate 40-year-olds acting like crazed teenagers any day of the week.  <br />

B00006ADFL|5.0|Although raised in another part of the British Empire, my mother has admitted to vague recollections of this sinister story that rocked New Zealand in 1954.    In the film that put Director Peter Jackson on the map, the tragic story of an obsessive teenage friendship in a more conservative time in his homeland is recounted through the diary entries of schoolgirl Pauline Yvonne Parker, a girl of a lower middle class family, whose main point of interest is her best friend, the aristocratic English girl, Juliet Hulme.   In their respective initial film roles as the two girls, native New Zealander, Melanie Lynskey, and the appropriately British Kate Winslet, are superb.   After we are led through a charming promotional film of early 1950s Christchurch, we then hear the bloodcurdling screams of two girls who, from a distance, appear to be at play, but who are hysterically running from the scene of a murder they just committed.   Following an explanatory caption of the story, we are led into a world of prissy, bobbed-haired schoolgirls in uniforms, and it is at school that Pauline and Juliet meet and become bosom friends, linked by their common experiences of serious childhood illnesses, their love of art and writing, wildly imaginative behavior, and their love of Mario Lanza's singing--traits I myself had in common with them at that age, although I never took things as far as they did.   We see the respective contrasts in the lifestyles of the two girls; Juliet's life as the daughter of Henry Hulme(Clive Merrison) the rector of  Canterbury College, his marriage-counselor wife, Hilda( Diana Kent, who is prettier than the actual Hilda Hulme), and with her young brother. Dressed as a princess  when Pauline first visits her at Ilam, her world appears to be an idyllic one.   Pauline lives with her  father, mother, grandmother, and older sister (Simon O'Connor, Sarah Peirse, Lou Dobson, and Kirstie Ferry)in a boarding house, where her mother proves to be a justifyably strictdisciplinarian, especially when Pauline has an affair with one of the boarders, and her grades in school slip.   The girls' time together gallops merrily along to the tune of Lanza's \\"Donkey Serenade\\" , and other recordings, which never fail to make them giddy. I cringe at the scenes where copies of his albums are destroyed, having had that unfortunate experience myself, and have noted the irony of the singer's death around the time of the girls' release from prison.   We see the girls' rejection of traditional religious values,  although one family still celebrate Christmas. When I first viewed this film, I experienced confusion about the actual names of the girls since they use so many of them for each other.   There is a concern that the girls are having a lesbian affair--less acceptable in those days--although years later one of them denied this.    When Juliet develops tuberculosis and has to be hospitalized for four months, her parents leave on a trip for England, continuing a long-standing pattern of depositing their daughter in a place from which they are often far away. Pauline and her mother are Juliet's only visitors.   The striking thing about this tragedy is that Pauline, like many teenagers, deluded herself into thinking her friend had the perfect life despite evidence to the contrary. Granted that the Hulmes were elegant, highly educated people, who lived on a grand estate and Pauline's family weren't. But Pauline should have had more regard for her friend's chronic illness, emotional fragility, abandonment issues, and ultimately, an act of hedonism on the part of Juliet's mother that tears the Hulme Family apart--setting the stage for the coming tragedy--and counted her blessings, since her own family, such as it was, was still intact, and her own parents were much more attentive to her. Ironically, a long-hidden family secret-- barely touched upon during a feud Pauline has with her mother-- would emerge as a result of the tragedy in Victoria Park. But like many teenagers of today, Pauline could have learned to make the most of her own situation regardless of its disadvantages.   In her poem, \\"The Ones I Worship\\", Pauline describes her feelings about herself especially when in Juliet's company. They are \\"Heavenly Creatures\\", superior to the common moral code. Psychologists call this view, the \\"Personal Fable\\", common among adolescents. Among Pauline's growing number of delusions is one of Dr. Hulme as her own father.   Whether one views the edited or unedited version of this film--the latter of which shows more significant details--the portrayal of the girls' overactive fantasy life alternates between comical and surreal.   When Juliet is slated to leave for South Africa to live with an aunt, the adults make the fateful decison to let the girls stay together until Juliet's departure.   Questions with which I was left include,\\"What made Pauline assume Juliet's aunt would be as willing to take her in as she was her own niece?\\", and, \\"Did they really think murder would solve their problems?\\"   As devastating as their impending separation was, Pauline should have accepted her parent's refusal to let her go with Juliet. Were it not for the murder of the flawed and complex mother who loved her, not only might the two girls have been reunited over time, but perhaps Pauline may have had a different perspective about the Hulmes, whose ineptitude in looking after their own children may have resulted in Pauline's neglect as well.   Juliet, who is now, ironically, the Victorian-era murder mystery novelist, Anne Perry, has lamented certain inaccuracies in the film. But as she and Pauline, who was identified as Hilary Nathan three years after the film's release, were unavailable for consultation during production, which may have resulted in the illegal correspondance of the two women, Peter Jackson did his best with available rescources, and the stunning and haunting results speak well enough for themselves.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I know there's divided opinion on the worth of this album.  I'm not particularly a Coldplay fan and in fact this is the first one I've actually bought.  Personally I but CD's because I believe I will enjoy listening to them (what a surprise!) and this one is no exception. It may be true that some of the songs appear to be somewhat recycled from previous relaeases but they are still different.  I particularly like the first track (Square One) which does have shades of U2 about it.  It is hard not to fall for Fix You. I love the way it switches to it's crescendo and back again. Speed of Sound is also worth mentioning as an above average track.  <br /> <br />This album really grew on me after I listened to it a few times.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I have been a big depeche mode fan since the early 90's when I had a friend introduce me to the ban when I was in high school.<br /><br />Playing the Angel I believe brings a Depeche mode that is different than what we are all used to.  With David and Martin both having solo albums before this project, I have a sense that when they got together they wanted to go back to a sound that came from the albums of Black Celebration and Music for the Masses. I suggest listening to those two albums and going back and listening to the new album for the second time.  I've listened to the album for the third time now and I'm quite happy with the sound. Again, it is just different than your \\"CLASSIC\\" depeche mode.<br /><br />One of the cool things that DP has going for them now is \\"REMIXES\\". There is already a EP Remix for the single off this album called Precious.<br /><br />Cheers..
B000A6CLL0|3.0|Braga and Berman wrecked the series in Season 1 by introducing the \\"temporial war\\" and rewriting the history of Star Trek essentially because they could.  They wrote ridiculously PC stories and dumbed down the characters to the point they were little more than wooden robots coached from offscreen.  They had this fascination with caves that bordered on the unreal (look up the filksong \\"Caves of the Heart\\").  They freely stole stories from other ST series and made hashes of them.   <br /> <br />Having said that, Season Three bordered on the passable.  If they had STARTED with this season, Enterprise would still be in production and most likely a hit today.  It did nothing but improve as the season went along and provided a few moments of gripping action with some fresh ideas thrown in along the way.  Much of this was because B&B brought on Manny Coto who had a much better feel for the show than them and could actually write his way out of a paper sack when the Muse was with him.  But by then it was too late:  Too many \\"hard core\\" ST fans had been lost and there was no great attraction to draw in new fans and the show sputtered and died. <br /> <br />If they ever decide to \\"reimagine\\" Enterprise let me make a few suggestions: <br /> <br />- No time travel.  It's been so badly overused in the ST franchise that if any plot device deserves retirement, it's this. <br /> <br />- Follow WC Fields' advice:  \\"Never work with dogs or kids.\\"  Porthos was cute exactly once and added nothing to the story.  If you have to have an animal aboard ship make it a cat or a monkey:  they can act. <br /> <br />- NO VULCANS.  There is no \\"law\\" of Star Trek that every ship MUST have a Vulcan Science Officer.  Joleen Blalock looks just as good in a skin-suit WITHOUT the pointy ears as with them.  T'Pol added nothing to the series except the constant reminder that Humans are ignorant savages with no social skills and no understanding of Galactic Society.  This is a story about mankind reachingout to the universe; they don't need a schoolmarm along to scold them for being uncouth. <br /> <br />- For that matter, don't name the ship (or series) \\"Enterprise\\".  As startling as this sounds, this invites direct comparisons to the other ships and casts in the Star Trek franchise and this is terribly divisive to the audience.  The best of the \\"modern\\" ST series was DS-9 and the USS Enterprise barely showed up there at all.  You don't need a \\"5-year mission\\", either.  JUST A GOOD STORY.  Heck, they could have hitched a ride on an Andorian freighter to the Expanse and used a shuttle to get around once there:  The NX-01 was almost useless and a constant distraction.  If they have a ship give it a lower profile: make it a plot device to get from point A to point B and don't make such a big deal over it being \\"the first Warp 5 capable starship\\".  NO ONE CARES.  It will never be as good as the NCC-1701, A, B, C, D, or E versions because it's from 100 years in the past.
B000000OSE|4.0|Appetite For Destruction introduced the world to the whiskey-drenched, sex-soaked world of Guns N' Roses. their attitude alone was worth it's weight in tunes on that disc. now it's time for the big bloated two disc follow up. this could have been an epic step in hard rock, but Use Your Illusion is a tough one to fully embrace. there are plenty of moments of profound greatness on both discs. but plenty of missteps plague the overall album's scope and focus. the one obvious change is the shift in styles from a very hard rocking glam sound to a more boogie-woogie Aerosmith style. but GNR pull it off and do it so well, so no real complaints. another interesting shift which shows their growing maturity as a band are the symphonic elements added to the balladry and a sort of prog rock kind of mentality in some of the song structures (which sometimes works and sometimes does not). Use Your Illusion suffers from two big drawbacks: the lack of quality control (both volumes could have been shortened by at least 5 songs apiece) and the overloaded vocals of Axl. it sounds like he spent just a little too much time in the vocal booth adding layer upon layer of synthesized voice effects and random chatter. basically, a worthwhile effort, but comes nowhere close to capturing the attitude and spirit of the Appetite For Destruction album.<br /><br />but there are some great songs on here. \\"Dust And Bones\\" has a very cool swagger to it, and the hungry drive of songs like \\"Perfect Crime\\" and \\"Garden Of Eden\\" comes close to the GNR sound of old. one of the standout gems on this record is the song \\"Double Talkin' Jive\\" which contains a great catchy chorus but is almost ruined by those stupid vocals effects that Axl insists on using. but thankfully, the song is saved by the hook. the cover of \\"Live and Let Die\\" is just plain unnecessary and placed third in the tracklisting, it almost halts the momentum of the album right from the early stages. thankfully, the monumental rock balladry of \\"November Rain\\" and \\"Don't Cry\\" (my favorite GNR song) shine through and add a dramatic, epic touch of class. one would be hard strained not to pick out the big Queen influence in these numbers. the first volume of this hit and miss series ends with a touch of  genius with \\"Coma\\", a dramatic hard rocking song full of surprises and promise.\\"November Rain\\" and \\"Don't Cry\\" (my favorite GNR song) shine through and add a dramatic, epic touch of class. one would be hard strained not to pick out the big Queen influence in these numbers. the first volume of this hit and miss series ends with a touch of  genius with \\"Coma\\", a dramatic hard rocking song full of surprises and promise.

B00005JNEW|3.0|The best thing about \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is how it exposes the small town obsession with high school football.  In Odessa, Texas, where the story is set, businesses shut down and radio sports commentators opine with the pretentious air of political pundits when the Permian Panthers take to the field.  Now this is some serious football country, as the mood of the town fluctuates with the win/loss record of the team and family dynamics follow along with the ebb and flow of the season.  It may be that somebody down there in Odessa just seriously needs to get a life.<br /><br />Based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, the film recounts the 1988 season when Coach Gary Gaines, despite the loss of his best player, still managed to carry his team to the state championships.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the storyline and characters in the film are not always as interesting as the setting and milieu.  The drama is occasionally lacking and many of the characters rank as little more than hoary sports movie cliches: the supportive coach's wife; the abusive, alcoholic father trying to relive his high school glory days through his son; the cocky star player humbled by the exigencies of a cruel fate.  Yet, the film has assets that help it to overcome some of the weaknesses of the script.  Billy Bob Thornton plays Gaines as a thoughtful, even-tempered individual who knows what it takes to win but understands that life does not begin and end on the football field.  His inspirational locker room speech towards the close is restrained, pointed and well delivered.  In fact, the coach seems far less obsessed with winning than many of the ordinary folks he runs into - and has to take unsolicited advice from - on a daily basis.  It is that pressure to win at all costs - placed not only on the boys but on the coach as well - that the movie dramatizes so effectively.  The film also makes it clear that, for many of these boys, football is the only ticket they will ever have out of small town America.<br /><br />\\"Friday Night Lights\\" isn't nearly as compelling and involving as \\"Remember the Titans,\\" but diehard football fans won't be complaining.have out of small town America. <br /> <br />\\"Friday Night Lights\\" isn't nearly as compelling and involving as \\"Remember the Titans,\\" but diehard football fans won't be complaining.
B00003CX8U|5.0|I'm a straight man, and I think Fosse is a god. I could never handle sappy musicals like \\"Brigadoon,\\" where jelly-spined men sit in fully-orchestrated (?) forests singing their maudlin hearts out to the woman of their dreams. Please! I couldn't even handle the lowly Elvis flicks that weakly attempted a similar Broadway treatment, but Fosse is different. Yes, these are musicals, but the music and the productions are VERY COOL -- hot, sexy, productions that will knock your socks off. AND, Fosse doesn't employ the artifice of staging the musical numbers in Central Park or in the clouds somewhere. His stuff is steamy, gutsy, visceral production (think rock video, but MUCH better), and the music only shows up where it would in the real world. \\"Cabaret\\" was a Fosse flick -- great story, great acting, great production. \\"All That Jazz\\" is actually somewhat autobiographical. It features Roy Scheider as a Fosse-like choreographer/producer pushing to cement a stage production and ultimately suffering a heart attack from the stress. It's a totally involving, often surreal experience, and you won't have to give up any of your manhood to get off on it.<br /><br />Oh, I forgot to mention that a subplot running throughout this movie is Fosse's editing efforts to refine the final cut for the movie \\"Lenny\\" (his Lenny Bruce biopic starring Dustin Hoffman and Valerie Perrine -- also a recommended flick, non-musical).

B000B2YQX4|5.0|01. A Pain That I'm Used To: The introduction sounds like the introductions of \\"I Feel You\\" and \\"The Dead of Night\\" remixed together. This song has angst written all over it. It is interesting, though, how one of the last lines of the song is \\"with a prayer in the air I will leave it there, on a note full of hope, not despair.\\" Kinda contradictory, huh? Great way to open up the record. <br /> <br />02. John The Revelator: I keep imagining that this song would fit into a \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\"-esque movie. The music would totally fit in with that type of film. Without a doubt one of the catchiest songs on the album, especially with the call and response chorus (\\"Well, who's that shouting? John the Revelator!\\").  <br /> <br />03. Suffer Well: One of the selected tracks on this album that, in my opinion, you can be able to dance to. This song also has one of the best guitar riffs Martin plays on the record. The chorus could be taken as sort of an inspiration to people listening to the song that are going through some tough times in life(\\"Just hang on, suffer well...An angel led me when I was blind, I said take me back I've changed my mind, now I believe...\\"). Thumbs up to David for writing a very good song. <br /> <br />04. The Sinner In Me: The synthesizers in this song make it reminscent of Nine Inch Nail's song \\"Closer.\\" This is the most industrial song they've recorded since \\"People Are People,\\" but this is by far better than it. Just when you think it's over, Martin's kickin' guitar solo brings you right back into the song for one more chorus. <br /> <br />05. Precious: This is definitely the \\"sweetest\\" song on the album, and by \\"sweetest\\" I mean in sound and melody. Very upbeat compared to the rest of the album so far. The song is definitely moving (emotionally and physically). If you know the story behind the song, it can even be touching and heartbreaking at the same time. This is one of David's best vocals on the album.  <br /> <br />06. Macro: There are some similarities between this and \\"Comatose,\\" what with the various sounds made by the synthesizers in the background. The guitar solo at the end would remind you of \\"Breathe\\" if you listen closely. Martin's vocals are pretty good and they are enhanced with David singing the chorus in the background.  <br /> <br />07. I Want It All: The beginning of this song may remind you of Paper Monsters, which is no surprise because this was written by David. This is one of the best ballads (if you can call them that when referring to this band) they've ever done. Traces of \\"Waiting For The Night\\" show up here in various places.  <br /> <br />08. Nothing's Impossible: Another song that has a couple of uplifting lyrics in the mist of the pain, suffering and darkness (\\"Even the stars look brighter tonight...I still believe in love at first sight, nothing's impossible.\\") This also reminds me of Paper Monsters, but not as much as the previous track. <br /> <br />09. Introspectre: Not one of their best instrumentals. They have had better ones (\\"Headstar\\", \\"Uselink\\"), but this doesn't mean it's all bad. It does sort of tie in with the next track. It's not good, but it's not bad. It's just there, and there's nothing you can do about it, except skip to the next song. <br /> <br />10. Damaged People: The best vocal performance by Martin on the record. The high note he reaches at the end of each chorus can get you right down to your very soul. Ends way too soon. It could've gone on for at least another minute or so. <br /> <br />11. Lilian: Another dance track makes the cut. This song, in my opinion, has the album's mantra (\\"Pain and misery always hit the spot\\"). Reminsicent of songs from Violator and Music For The Masses. Another great guitar solo from Martin throughout the song after the first chorus. David's vocals are very good in this song, just like the rest of the songs on the album that he sings. <br /> <br />12. The Darkest Star: What a beautiful song to close the record out with.And, dare I say, it reminds me a little bit of \\"Goodnight Lovers\\", I guess because of the slow lullaby quality to it. Martin's harmony vocals are very haunting in this song. So are David's lead vocals, especially towards the end of the song. A very beautiful song indeed. As it fades, you just want more, but there is no more, for this is the end of the album; the journey you take with Depeche Mode for 52 minutes out of your life. <br /> <br />Overall Feelings: I've been listening to this album all the way through, no skipping tracks, in my CD player since I bought it yesterday (yes, all the way through, people. I can bring myself to listen to Introspectre). I'm not letting a mediocre instrumental throw me off when I say that this a great record. Everything is falling into place for the band again and they're better than ever. <br /> <br />Rating: 4  out of 5 stars
B000000OQF|5.0|too often mislabled as \\"heavy metal,\\" Appetite For Destruction stands as an undisputable landmark album of hard rock. everything about this album is a classic, from the killer artwork, to the controversy of the band, and the amazingly solid rock and roll. dirty, sweaty, young, foollish and real.
B000002MTR|4.0|ive been a rhcp fan for awhile and this album was the last album i checked out because i was so reluctant to hear it - being a huge frusciante fan. but after getting more into Jane's Addiction i finally listened to the album. at first it's very strange because you're hearing a lot of spacey effects and various guitar tracks, which is new for rhcp fans, but once i got into the melodies - i began loving this album. <br /> <br />all of these songs are true red hot chili pepper songs at heart. it's just Dave Navaro's alternative influence sort of warps it. this is his best guitar work i've heard so far from him. he has a great guitar style that mixes in a very atmospheric sound to the album. i was very moved by it and it really gave me a new perspective to look into. i found both the guitar and Flea's bass playing very clever. the bass intro to Transcending made me feel like this song was going to kick me in the head. and it did. Anthony's singing and lyrics are good but nothing really innovative. but it did tie in perfectly with the vibe the album gave out.  <br /> <br />compared to the other Chili Pepper albums, this one definitely stands out. but that doesnt mean it's their best. if Dave Navaro were still in the band and they made another album - i'm pretty confident they'd never make another One Hot Minute. of course afterwards everyone felt Dave never fit in - but i'm glad they created such an enjoyable album.  <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Hmmm... Nisam jos uvek siguran ali mislim da je ovo najbolji album koji je izasao 2005. Da budem jasan ovaj album kao celina zvuci perfektno i zaista je tesko odvajati pesmu po pesmu.  <br />Prava reakcija na Americki zivot, svest, sistem i politiku. <br />Velicanstveno i zasluzuje svu vasu paznju.  <br />
0694003611|4.0|We have been reading this book to our 18 month old daughter almost every night for a couple months.  Now every night when we take her to her room she points to the book and says \\"moon, moon\\" and until we read it to her.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Arrived really fast, and exactly as it said it would. No scratches, looked like new.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|I have a lot of Buddy Guy stuff recently and this is the best of the lot.  It may be a bit like Santana's Supernatural where he invited guest artists and gets some crossover to other genres.  But his playing is as good as ever and the production is killer.  The sound on my stereo is superb.  THis disk rocks in ways not many blues albums do.  I love this disk and it's a great intro to Buddy so don't be shy about ordering it.  You'll like it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Pratim Madonna rad od samog pocetka njene karijere. Posle albuma Ray Of Light pomislio sam \\"Ovo je nesto najbolje sto je uradila i od ovog vise ne moze. Ovo je biser pop muzike.\\" Ah, kako sam se prevario. <br />Album American Life je nesto najsavrsenije i najzrelije sto nam je ikona pop muzike ikada ponudila. <br />Krenimo od pesme American Life koja otvara album, i koja najavljuje samo polovinu onog sto cete osetiti do kraja albuma. Surovu istinu. <br />Donosi nam Madonna u sasvim novom svetlu, tako da mi je apsolutno jasno sto su neki ljudi ovom album dali jednu zvezdicu. Ne treba ih kriviti, jednostavno nisu razumeli album ili se nisu ukljucili dovoljno u novo vreme. Njima jednostavno preostaje da slusaju nesto prostije zato valjda i postoje Christina i J.Lo i njima slicne.  <br />Pesma Hollywood je pravi pogodak, sint elektro koji daje svezinu, i mozda najbolja Madonna pesma, na koju se nadovezuje Im So Stupid pomalo konfuzna ali opet savrseno uklopljena.Love Profusion nam donosi vec pomalo zaboravljeni pravi pop koji ne moze nikog da ostavi ravnodusnim i vodi nas do Nobody Knows Me pravog electro-clash pogodka. A onda se spusta lopta na zemlju uz Nothing Fails, verovatno najbolju M. baladu koja se izvija vise nego M. klasik Take A Bow. Logicno slede Intervention i X-static Process, i tako vidan uticaj Bob Dylan. A onda se vracaju na scenu elektro udari i Mirwise stupa u najboljem svetlu sa Mother and Fother i James Bond temom Die Another Day. <br />Odlican album zatvara smirena pesma Easy Ride i tera vas da ovaj album vracate besomucno na pocetak. <br />Kraljica je kraljica, i tu nema govora i mesta za nikoga drugog. Njeno ime se zna. <br />Jednostavno. Provokativno. <br />Madonna <br /> <br />
0689835604|5.0|This is a great lift the flap book for toddlers.  The flaps are large which makes it easier for little hands.  Fun book to read with a toddler.  Our 18 month old daughter loves it.  It kept her busy for quite a while on a recent airplane trip.
B000055Y0X|4.0|For my high school English class we watched \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\" Though I often needed the teacher's help to catch some \\"funny parts\\" I personally, found the movie very interesting. The \\"funny parts\\" aren't exactly what I would call hilarious. The irony in this film isn't \\"ha ha\\" funny.  To enjoy this movie you must understand irony and satires. One thing I enjoyed most about the movie is the satires, the hidden, dry comedy.  <br /> <br />For example, the \\"Peace Is Our Profession\\" sign is ironic because in front of the sing there are men killing each other. The irony is so strong to a point where few understand it. The irony proves so much about our world today. The men in the army are trained to fight and become enemies in order to make peace. <br /> <br />There are a few quotes that I remember the most. For example, when General Buck Turgidson says \\"Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks.\\" This is ironic because if the bomb hits Russia the whole world is going to end. No one will be alive.  <br /> <br />Another quote I remember the most was said by President Merkin Muffley. \\"Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room,\\" is very ironic. The War Room is used to plan out strategies for War. Telling them they can't fight is ironic because here they are planning on killing other people.  <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Like every movie, not everyone will like it. For some it will be hard to understand at first. Some parts are needed to be explained to understand the \\"funny part.\\" This is definitely a movie I would watch any chance I got.  <br />
B00004YKUY|5.0|Arrival marks the first album by the current line up of Neal Schon, Johnathan Cain, Ross Valory, Deen Castronov, and Steve Augeri. Arrival was released in 2001, five years after Trial by Fire, the last album to feature Steve Perry on vocals. <br /> <br />One thing I would like to say is that I am tired of people who keep b*tching about Steve Perry no longer being in the group. Get over, many bands have replaced members. Journey is not Steve Perry's band anyway, Neal Schon and Greg Rolie(keyboardist up to 1980) were the founders of Journey. Steve Perry didn't join until Journey's fourth album Infinity. There was Journey before Steve Perry, and there can be a Journey after Steve Perry. <br /> <br />For Arrival, it is an excellent disc. It is very impressive for being the first album with a new singer. Arrival is far from my favorite Journey album, but it does rank up there with some of Journey's best work. Arrival easily surpasses \\"Raised on Radio\\", and \\"Trial by Fire.\\" Highlights include Higher Place, All the Way, Signs of Life, Loved by You, Livin to Do, World Gone Wild, and I Got a Reason. <br />Steve Augeri is fits perfectly with the rest of the band. Journey is my favorite band, I own every Journey album, and I most say the current lineup may very well be the best. If you get a chance see these guys in concert.
B00003CXCT|4.0|It is a trilogy which I have seen previously & wish to add to my library. I now need to add 1,2,3
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Troy delivers on a grand scale. This is the best of the fantasy/myth movies such as Clash of the Titans, Lord of the rings, or the Odyssey. This movie is a shear visual feast! First rate locations and cast. They had to completely rebuild the wall of troy because a hurricane took it out! Diane Kruger is a beautiful, and sexy helen. The actress who played Persauss was equally beautiful. But the best character performance is Brian Cox as Agamemnon. Followed very closely by Eric Bana as Hector. Brad Pitt and Peter O' Tool have great performances as well. The battle scenes are very well done. They don't look computer generated, even through I'm sure some parts are. This movie is so good, I'm just surprized Mel Gibson did not wind up in it. The only complaint I can find with this film is they just about kill everyone in the end, maybe you have to do that in a film like this. I don't know. Tell you what I do know through, this dvd is worth the money.
B000301YY8|5.0|This stunning debut by James Blunt--a British soldier turned musician--will take your breath away; literally! Every single track on this beautiful release is lyrically multidimensional with incredible depth and addictive melodies. It's definitely the best release by a new artist this year hands down.<br /><br />The ballad-heavy, Back to Bedlam, is romanticism reinvented. The ecstatic High starts off the album with James pleading, \\"Will you be my shoulder / when I am gray and older / promise me tomorrow starts with you.\\"<br /><br />It's followed by \\"You're Beautiful\\"--an ode to love that can't be had. Equally beautiful and heartbreaking as he sings, \\"But it's time to face the truth / I will never be with you.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wisemen\\", one of my favorite tracks, asks \\"Gotta ask yourself the question / where are yo now?\\" It's one of those<br /><br />In the melancholic ballad \\"Goodbye my Lover\\", James pleads with his departed love to remember the good times they had together and try to be his friend. He ends it with the chilling, \\"I'm so hollow baby / I'm so hollow.\\"<br /><br />Then comes my favorite track in this release, \\"Tears and Rain\\", in which James wishes he could do away with all the demons in his head and soul; the conflicts that come with the simple act of living life. He even makes a reference to 'Dorain Gray\\"--Oscar Wild's alter ego character from The Picture of Dorian Gray. Absolutely solid track!<br /><br />The album goes on with songs commenting on the craziness of life's affairs with \\"Out of my Mind\\" to infidelity with \\"Billy.\\"<br /><br />\\"Cry\\" and \\"No Bravery\\" are two emotionally packed tracks through which James tells us what he thinks of war. In \\"No Bravery\\" he goes:<br /><br />\\"There are children standing here,<br /><br />Arms outstretched into the sky,<br /><br />Tears drying on their face.<br /><br />He has been here.<br /><br />Brothers lie in shallow graves.<br /><br />Fathers lost without a trace.<br /><br />A nation blind to their disgrace,<br /><br />Since he's been here.<br /><br />And I see no bravery,<br /><br />No bravery in your eyes anymore.<br /><br />Only sadness.\\"<br /><br />James Blunt's voice takes some time to get used to, but his passion, lyrics and music are irresistible. He is to 2005 what Damien Rice was to 2004: definitely the best new artist of the year!<br /><br />I've never listened to an album so much since Keane's. It's guaranteed to satisfy regardless of what genre of music you are into.<br /><br />I am still singing along!en here. <br /> <br />And I see no bravery,  <br />No bravery in your eyes anymore. <br />Only sadness.\\" <br /> <br />James Blunt's voice takes some time to get used to, but his passion, lyrics and music are irresistible.

1400082773|4.0|Fascinating account, and considering it was written well before his national prominence  (with no ghost writer), well worth reading.

B00081U6EG|1.0|Do not buy this DVD as it is a total waste of money,Joe Walsh can <br />be heard on a much better DVD with Eagles Farewell 1 Melbourne,Au. This DVD DOES NOT have DTS 5.1 Audio format as advertised.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Franz Ferdinand's self-titled debut swept me away in a frenzy of addictive hooks and daring lyrics last year. The follow-up \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\", is still daring yet mature both musically and lyrically. Production, however, is a bit overdone on this album (thus the missing star). The tracks are sonically loud, which can be annoying at times.<br /><br />Like \\"Cheating on You\\" on the first album, FF says it the way it is in \\"You're the Reason I'm Leaving.\\" I love singing along to this one! It's addictive.<br /><br />\\"some granite wall<br /><br />Numbs our bones, numbs our all<br /><br />As we sit on skinny hands<br /><br />Nothin to say, nothin at all<br /><br />oh<br /><br />I don't know you<br /><br />and I<br /><br />I don't want to<br /><br />You're so awkward just like me<br /><br />But I don't care<br /><br />Ohhh, You're the reason I'm leavin<br /><br />You're the reason I'm leavin<br /><br />If I'm leaving we don't stop livin, you know\\"<br /><br />FF does ballads too with \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" and \\"Fade Together\\", which is my favorite out of the three. Another favorite track is \\"Outsiders\\" It's fun to dance to!<br /><br />All in all, a solid follow-up. Get it!
B00024I31C|5.0|I have been listening to JJ Cale since the 60's and this is his finest work. Every tune is a catchy lick.
B00082IJ08|1.0|This CD is hard to listen to.  The second I bought it I put it in the CD player and fast forwarded to the one song I knew.  The rest sucked.  They were painful to listen to and nothing like their songs on the radio.  Don't buy this if you just like their singles, as the entire album is crap.  I'm guessing you'd have to be a huge Gorillaz fan to buy this...even then I would think twice...blah!  Freecycle here it comes...
B000000JO3|5.0|When i first heard minor threat i was too young to appreciate the punk/hardcore scene. Then, years later when my tape broke i bought the CD and it was awesome. For anyone who likes punk rock and for anyone new to the scene this is a good place to find your roots. Although,  theres not much music by these guys they still made their place in the punk industry  and i highly reccomend it.
B000A7DVR2|1.0|Picture and sound quality is a bit improved, but other than that you are spending money on the exact same DVD. Usually, when a \\"Collector's Edition\\" is released, especially after a movie gains such a huge cult following like Lebowski has, people actually go through the effort of including cast commentaries, more bonus features, and...well, more than just repackaging the old DVD with a new name, a new cover, and a higher retail price. <br /> <br />Shame on Universal and Focus Features.
B000000I3O|5.0|This was the first Misfits CD I ever got, and it's one of my favorite cds. Now I have all of their cds, well at least the ones with Glenn Danzig in them. If you're new to the Misfits buy this and then The Collection II. Then if you have a cd burner, burn them both on one cd, and then you'll have a pretty bitchin' cd
B00005JOGU|4.0|Everything I've read or heard about this film proved true. It is a fascinating look at Truman Capote's obsessive pursuit of the story of 2 drifters/murderers that he helped to make immortal with his book In Cold Blood.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as Capote and he is already being hyped as the Oscar winner for his performance. He invests the character with enough desperation and pathos to explain Capote's alchoholism without having to really shove it in our noses. You may not like this guy by the end of the film but you will ,for better or worse ,understand him.<br /><br />Catherine Keener is equally fabulous as Harper Lee of To Kill A Mockingbird fame. She gives a very understated and yet satifying performance.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars ? Despite the fine acting and other attributes of this film, including some incredible sets and costuming that gets the late 50's just right (not to mention the cars)..I found myself bored at certain points in the film where the momentum just seemed to stall.<br /><br />Nevertheless this is well worth seeing.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I already wasted enough of my time listening to this romper room music, and I can't be bothered to expend my energy into  writing a review, but I will give a quick synopsis. No Good.
B000055Y0X|4.0|This movie takes places in the 50's Cold War Era, when the threat of nuclear war between the United States and the U.S.S.R is at a high risk. The title is of a German Dr. working for the United States government, who doesn't have control of his right arm. You don't see him until midway through the movie. It starts out when General Ripper of Burpleson Air force Base sends out a message for the B-52 bombers to bomb the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons. The thing is General Ripper did this without authorization from any higher authority. General Ripper is psychotic, which you can tell throughout the movie by some of the things he says. Through the plan the bombers are given a code only he knows so. The General kills himself midway through the movie along with the knowledge of what the code is. Captain Mandrake, General Ripper's executive officer, figures out the code and relays it to the War Room and they recall the bombers, but one does not turn around. This is Major Kong's plane, which was hit by a missile and its radio is disabled. The plane then flies to a missile complex and drop the bomb with Major Kong riding on top of it into battle. This sets off a Dooms Day Machine, which will destroy the world. <br />This movie has a lot of satire in it. One of the most memorable ones is when the President says, \\"Gentlemen, You can't fight in here this is a war room.\\" Another one is when the army is trying to infiltrate the Burpleson Air Force Base they are shooting under a sign that says \\"Peace is our Profession.\\" Major Kong is represented as the basic American hero. He overcame many obstacles to complete his mission, but what is ironic is that if he completes his mission everyone dies. <br />I would recommend this movie it was entertaining and had a lot of meaning in the script. The writers satirized something while putting some humor in it as well. I think if u lived during that time u might understand  <br />
068987474X|5.0|This book breaks down all seemingly obvious barriers. Everything I read was something that I know all women have already realized at one point or another in their lives. However, the way the authors phrase the obvious is a wake-up call that I really needed. It breaks down every aspect of bad male behavior, demands that it not be justified, and proceeds to encourage you to believe that you are fantastic, wonderful, and completely undeserving of the crap men will put you through. PLEASE READ! You will not regret it.
B000B9EY2U|5.0|Depeche Mode is back with a retro sounding album. I've had the chance to hear this album for 2 weeks now and could provide you a detailed review. This album sounds like a cross between Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion, but also contains tracks that would have easily fitted on Black Celebration and Music For the Masses. <br /> <br />01.A Pain That I'm Used To : Probably the 2nd best track on the album after Precious and will be their 2nd single as rumor has it. The track starts out with a groovy bassline. This is an upbeat track with a strange verse in a style we have never heard Gahan sing before, but it sounds real good and the chorus is catchy. 5/5 <br /> <br />02.John The Revelator : This one has Gahan singing in louder yelling type voice, which is not in his normal style. The music and singing reminds me of Nitzer Ebb's \\"Ebbhead\\" album and this song could have been easily a song from that album. 4/5 <br /> <br />03.Suffer Well : This is one of the best tracks on the album. It's one of the 3 tracks written by Dave and it's the first time Dave is contributing in writing. Up to now Martin Gore was 100% songwriter of all DM songs. This one has a beat and music similar to Behind the Wheel/Route 66 tracks.  CONGRATS DAVE. 5/5 <br /> <br />04.The Sinner In Me : A mellow and catchy track with melodic synth layers and has a real cool distorted guitar breakdown in the middle. 5/5 <br /> <br />05.Precious : The first single and best track on the album. It has a melodic and catchy beat. The first time I heard this it reminded me of Enjoy The Silence and could have easily been a track from that era. <br /> <br />06.Macrovision : The track starts out with a bassline similar to \\"In your Room\\" and has the same type of singing. However, Martin Gore is singing on this one. The music and production on this is not so great. They could have worked on this a little more...maybe used a catchier beat. 4/5 <br /> <br />07.I Want It All : Another track by Dave Gahan. This is my fianc's favorite track of the album. It is a dark track and a very good effort by Dave, but it will take sometime for this one to grow on you. 4/5 <br /> <br />08.Nothing's Impossible : WOW! Here we go with a track that could have been on \\"Black Celebration\\" album. Very dark and eerie. This one is also by Dave. Somewhere  in the middle of the song comes this very analogish groovy synth sound. I love this track. 5/5 <br /> <br />09.Introspectre : OK, what the hell is this? A short instrumental, with no singing! It's wasting CD space. They could have easily put another track here. The B-side to \\"Precious\\" called \\"Free\\" could have been a great fit here. 1/5 <br /> <br />10.Damaged People : Another WOW! Starts out with metallic bell sounds and sang by Martin Gore. This one also reminds me of Black Celebration album. Martin's voice really fits this track well. 5/5 <br /> <br />11.Lillian : WOW Again. This one sounds very 80's. It reminds me of the track \\"The Great Commandment\\" by Camouflage, a band that usually sounded like DM, but now DM sounds like them. 5/5 <br /> <br />12.The Darkest Star : A dark track again with very cool vintage synth sounds. 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall this album is a 5 out of 5 and I would rate it better than Ultra and Exciter.
1400032717|1.0|I couldn't get into this book at all and stopped reading after the first chapter.  A friend, who shares similar interests in reading as me, loved it.  Go figure!
B000001FT0|4.0|This album is interesting (1982).  It sounds like he sat down at a keyboard and drum machine and simply recorded the entire album.  It's very raw and simple (complex at the same time) with little production and it is almost entirely steve winwood, a drum box, and keyboards.  There's good stuff on here includinghelp me angel, valerie, and talking back to the night.  Chronicles(1987) features versions of those songs listed above and are much more produced and much more powerful.  Valerie, from chronicles, has been played on mainstream radio since then.  I love winwood's vocal range and his keyboard patterns and it's interesting to hear a rock album so stripped down.  This album is much better than 1980s arc of a diver (while you see a chance).  Winwood is also renound for doing many different things and this album was much different than back in the high life (1986) which was much more organic but still electric. Overall, good album and a must for winwood fans.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I ordered this set of DVDs based on the advice of a \\"film freak\\" friend of mine.  I was a bit leery of a series described as a cross between space opera and a western.  Fortunately she , my friend, was right in thinking that I would love this series.  It's a great mix of underdog heroes, humor, some non-cloying romantic tension, some great stories and action scenes that are plausible. I found this series thoroughly enjoyable and was most vexed by having to go to work and/or sleep as it interfered with my watching the episodes.  I very much recommend watching this series.
B000002ADT|5.0|I have been listening \\"Kind of Blue\\" for past 5 years and it still on the run. Looking in my CD rack I sometime wonder which one to listen and I always switch over to this great Jazz classic created by the godfathers. Bill Evans was at his best with John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Cannonball Adderly. But personally it would have been great if Wynton Kelly could have played in some other numbers apart from \\"Freddie Freeloader\\". He is a blues giant. Anybody wants to start Jazz, kick off with this album and you will never repent.
B000002H97|4.0|it took over a million dollars and over 1 year to record this album.  This is their masterpiece musically, artistically, and on a production basis.  Those head bangers that claimed they sold out were just disappointed that metallica did something different.  Hetfield seemed to calm down a bit and sing clearer and play more clean.  Lars ulrich closed his highhat occassionally and seemed to have some great patterns. All four guys prooved that they had grown up.  the acoustic riffs and harmonizing are great on nothing else matters.  Unforgiven was well done and had some subtle keyboards in it.  Anywhere I roam and enter sandman became anthems of the 90s.  This album also produced a GNR-metallica tour that grossed a ton of dollars and attendence records.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is a great movie! If you love Mel Gibson,like I do this is the movoe for you!!!!!!!!!!
0060989157|5.0|It was a strange time the early 80's and while a lot of 'poodle rock' is best left in the past, it was an ultimate time for consumerism, capitalism and indulgence. This biography not only lays bare the lives of Motley Crue during this period but is also an excellent insight into the culture of the times and what it looks like from 2005.  <br />Even if you aren't a fan of the band, it's a fanscinating read and well worth getting it in paperback because once you start you just can't stop. <br />ROCK ON!
630521610X|5.0|This film is, and will always remain, a true classic.<br /><br />I can't really write a summary of the film without ruining it, but let it suffice to say that there is a crazed killer running around wearing a demented ghost mask, now known as the Scream Mask, and a rather horrible knife, and is trying to kill Sydney Prescott (played admirably by Neve Campbell, one of the best young actresses). And there's a lot of gore!<br /><br />A lot of films like this take quite a while to get the ball rolling. Not this one. It starts straight away, within the first five seconds, as doomed Drew Barrymore's character recieves a sinister phonecall from a man who is obsessed with horror movies. Let it suffice to say that we know immediately it isn't going to be a happy ending for her.<br /><br />With an all-star cast, featuring Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, Matthew Lillard, David Arquette, Courteney Cox and Skeet Ulrich, this is a FANTASTIC movie, and my personal favourite horror at the moment. I highly recommend it - Wes Craven truly is the master of slasher movies.
B000055Y0X|4.0|Dr. Strangelove? ?  What could that possibly be about?   Yeah that's what I was thinking when I heard we were watching a movie in English class called Dr. Strangelove.  Little did I know it was going to be the best movie that I had to watch in school so far.  Usually all the movies we watch are educational boring movies that you have to fight to stay awake during.  However, this black and white movie was just a jam packed satire.  In the beginning, Ripper sent out planes with nuclear bombs heading to Russia to stop the communists.  They are under a secret plan,  Plan R , which makes it impossible for anyone except Ripper to contact them.  So the president has a meeting in the War Room which by the way isn't allowed to have any kind of violence in.  They all talk everything over trying to come up with a plan to stop these planes.  The president knew that if the planes hit Russia it would be suicide because they would bomb us right back.  Later on in the movie we find out that Russia has a Dooms Day device and if you blow up Russia POOF the whole world goes with it.  So this really made everyone nervous and they knew they were in trouble if they couldn't find a way to stop these planes. <br /> <br />So they do many different things to try and contact the planes or stop them from hitting and meanwhile so much chaos is going on.  The movie basically targets men at the time since there's only one woman in the whole movie and she's just a playboy bunny.  Then men are the biggest satire because it's like  Oh well my nuclear bomb is bigger then yours    So Strangelove comes up with a bright idea, while fighting off his right hand, saying that if the bomb hits then they can go into a coal mine and live down there.  Of course there would have to be 10 women per man just so they can get the population back to normal. <br /> <br />I'm not going to spoil the ending or tell you too much about it so you can see for yourself.  I highly recommend this movie unless you are a group of 15 year old girls wanting to see a good movie with hot guys.  This is a movie filled with satire and something that makes you think a little and have a few laughs.  <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|Why doesn't everyone just shut up? If you like it, then that's great, whatever. But if you decided that after listening to ONLY American Idiot that Green Day are sellouts and they suck and all of the usual bs, then go take your comments somewhere else!!!! The whole freaking page is full of losers saying the same things over and over again about how they hate Green Day and it's getting really annoying. If you hate American Idiot, then please at least TRY to listen to their older albums, they're actually better than this album. So before you trash Green Day, make sure you've listened to something else besides AI, or else I'd say your stuck-up, opinionated, and just...stupid. Ahem, sorry about that, just venting my speen.  Anyways, for those of you that are open-minded enough to keep reading this, I say that this definitely NOT Green Day's best. I much prefer their older albums to this, but I do like some songs on here. Some are catchy, loud, and there's even traces of the old Green Day poking through. So if you're just getting into Green Day, don't start here, start with what they were all about, like maybe \\"1039/smoothed out....\\" or \\"dookie\\", \\"insomniac\\", and \\"nimrod\\"....why don't I just name all of their albums. But anyway, my point here is start somewhere else if your a new fan, and chances are that most of the old fans will either not care for this or flat out hate it. I, for one, am willing to give this a chance.
B000AP04FG|3.0|This is a hilarious, action-packed movie with two of the hottest actors in Hollywood who share amazing sexual chemistry.  The dialogue is ever-witty, and there's an important scene when the Smiths are interrogating their mark and said mark is wearing a Fight Club tee-shirt. <br /> <br />I really recommend this movie for people who want a fun romp and don't want to think too hard.   <br /> <br />However, it does portray some pretty severe domestic violence.  We live in a society where gunfights on TV and in the movies are commonplace, but this film goes a step farther and has a married couple grappling with fits, elbows, knees, and knives.  I watched it with two people who work at a local domestic violence center and, although we all enjoyed most of the movie, we were pretty appalled at the way domestic violence was tolerated. <br /> <br />All tongue-in-cheek?  Well, I enjoyed the movie anyway.
B00001X591|5.0|For a long time now, I've enjoyed starting my day with Albinoni.  His music (even over Vivaldi's music) puts me in a very positive frame of mind to meet the challenges of the day.  This recording on \\"original instruments\\" certainly starts my day most positively.  The playing on this CD is breath taking.  Hogwood and his Academy of Ancient Music are at their usual best delivering sharp and crisp performances of these works.  If you want to hear some of the finest examples of Baroque Composition coming from the very pinnacle of the period played exquisitely by one of the world's leading Baroque ensembles, buy this CD.  By the way the sound is marvelous too.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Aqualung is one of the all-time Rock classics. This not only Tull's finest hour but a bona-fide classic of Rock. <br />It starts with the graffic Aqualung about a homeless person. <br />Cross Eyed Mary contains some of Ian Anderson's finest flute. <br />To me the real finds are the acoustic pieces, Wondering Aloud, Cheap Day Return, Mother Goose and his finest acoustic song ever, My God. <br />Many have called this a concept album, it does talk about religion on multiple songs, but in my mind this is not a concept CD. <br />Wind Up and Locomotive Breath end a very fine album. <br />If you want to sample Tull and you dont have any of their albums you need to start with this one. It came out 35 years ago and still holds up to the test of time. That is the real measuring stick..............
B0009W5JS2|3.0|I've seen this film and I've read some of the reviews and while some of the points are valid, some are just flat out ridiculous! <br /> <br />First, on the film itself, it isn't bad but it won't go down in history as a great action flick! The plot is a little more than paperthin. We pretty much know that Ice Cube and company is going to save the day. <br /> <br />As for the character, in Ice Cube's defense, WHAT'S SO FREAKIN' BAD?! He basically plays the same character in all the films he's in! Even the classic urban tale \\"Boyz In The Hood\\" and his role in the \\"Friday\\" series is not too much different. As for no regard for human life, DID YOU EVEN WATCH THE FILM!? It was a Presidential Bullet Train! How many people are going to be on it anyway!? Plus, they already knew who was on it. Check for passengers? PLEASE! Besides, not too many action flicks have a regard for human life in them! <br /> <br />As for racism, there was plenty of that but what did you expect with Ice Cube as the lead!? All of his films are like that!  <br /> <br />Anyway, there are some cool CG effects in them. Take it for what it is and that's a mindless \\"shoot 'em up\\" romp! <br />
1558908382|4.0|This film is witty, yet takes a serious look at life choices and the ramifications of these choices. Ultimately, I think the message that we can change if we truly want to is an important one, and the ending exemplifies this. Cusak's dry sense of humor is at it's best in this film, similar to Better Off Dead.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I have seen all 4 Batman films prior to this one and this one BLOWS ALL OF THEM AWAY (even the still classic 1989 film starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson)! <br /> <br />Christian Bale's version of Batman is very intimidating! I remember watching this film originally in the theater and being scared to death for the guys he interrogated! The villians (Scarecrow/Ra's Al Guhl) were smartly handled well. Rachel, played by Katie Holmes, isn't eye-candy like the previous leading Bat-women. She actually has spunk and guts.  <br /> <br />Overall, all the characters in this film are very believable. For those that still want an \\"Adam West\\" type Batman, please rent the old 1960's film or 1997's \\"Batman & Robin\\" by Joel Schumacher! Otherwise, I'd skip this one because that style of Bats doesn't live here! For everyone else, get ready for great ride! :D
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is the best album I've ever heard. Green Day has always been exceptionally talented, but the harsh realities of the songs \\"American Idiot\\" & \\"Holiday\\" mixed with the tender/ sad moments of \\"When September Ends\\" makes for a poignoint, real perspective on modern life. The saga of the \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" mixed up with \\"St. Jimmy\\" are purely brilliant by their songwriter. I must issue a warning to parents however..in case anyone doesn't already know (lol), Billie Joe curses like a sailor. I was surprised at their concert by how many little kids were there...especially by an 8 year old girl with a broken leg (accompanied by her mother) who rode in the elevator with us. This is not music for an 8 year old, but I'd let an older teen jam along with me. Overall, exceptional!!! Another score for Green Day!
0385493800|3.0|it's funny how this book is roundly considered \\"Grisham's best\\" (if you believe the cover critics and the Amazon critics), and it happens to be a book having absolutely zero courtroom scenes.  no nuance, no legal manipulations, no twists or turns - just a bildungsroman. <br /> <br />without giving away the ending, dividing up 11 billion dollars just isn't a resolution that's satisfying.  whether lousy characters get 1% of the estate, or 1.2%, do i really care about the decimal point? <br /> <br />it's a nice story about a man (who happens to be an ex-lawyer) and his trip into the jungle, looking for someone but finding himself.  it's not pulitzer prize stuff, but it's an enjoyable read.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I've been a hardcore DM fan for 20 years.  They are without doubt to this day my favorite band and I still listen to all their songs religiously each day (yes, that includes stuff from Ultra and Exciter).<br /><br />Personally I think this album is a step better than Exciter.  While that album had 2 or 3 decent/so-so songs in a sea of boring/moody ambience...Playing the Angel has a few songs that actually stand out.  If anything, this album reminds me of Ultra...and the first single \\"Precious\\" reminds me of being the \\"It's No Good\\" of Ultra...meaning that Precious is the stand alone track that is in true \\"DMode\\" fashion...moody melodies backed by a nice beat.  Whereas Exciter lacked any of those \\"obvious\\" DM songs...Playing the Angel has that...and also \\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"John the Revelator\\" are all relatively good tunes that do stand out and are worthy of repeated listening.<br /><br />Unfortunately some parts of the CD still lack the urgency that made Depeche Mode's earlier albums so noteworthy.  But it's not fair to compare DM now to the DM of the Violator-era.  Rather, the band has gone through so many changes since David's drug problems and the departure of Alan Wilder -- that real critics should judge Playing the Angel with other post-Wilder offerings such as Ultra and Exciter...in order to really offer a fair comparison.  If you're the token DM fan who's looking for the next \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" - give up please.  They are not the same band as they were back in 1990 (and remember - that was 15 years ago!! - though it still feels like yesterday).  Rather, they are a more mature/laid back and introspective band than before...and at times they succeed with putting that into music, and sometimes not.<br /><br />This album is a better offering than Exciter...and is inching closer to the sound that we heard back on Ultra...  However, at least the noteworthy songs from the new album (\\"Precious\\", etc.) are much stronger than stuff like \\"Dream On\\" or \\"I Feel Loved\\" in the last album.<br /><br />And one note - I was fortunate enough to have a chance to meet David, Martin, Andy (albeit briefly) at a signing in NYC, and it was great seeing all their energy around this new release.  If anything, I am glad that they still care enough about DM to work on an album and still throw in a few gems here and there to add on to their impressive roster of albums and songs!!Loved\\" in the last album.   <br /> <br />And one note - I was fortunate enough to have a chance to meet David, Martin, Andy (albeit briefly) at a signing in NYC, and it was great seeing all their energy around this new release.

B000A6T1JU|4.0|Director Walter Hill has decided to revisit his movie and altered it slightly so that it closer resembles his original comic book vision. His new tweaks to the movie are obvious right from the get-go as he narrates an opening scrawl featuring parallels to some nonsense about what we are about to see with a Greek myth. Some of the scene transitions are now done in a more overt, comic book style a la panels featuring stylized frames from the movie. It doesn't look too bad but is unnecessary and does tend to upset the rhythm of the film somewhat.<br /><br />The Warriors is set almost entirely at night and presents the city as a dark, foreboding labyrinth fraught with danger that lurks around every corner, much like what Escape From New York would capitalize on for an even greater effect. Even though Hill claims this to be a comic book-like film, it really doesn't feel or look like one despite his recent tinkering. The gritty setting, the ominous music and the constant danger that our heroes are in doesn't evoke a comic book vibe at all. And this is what fans of the film like about it.<br /><br />\\"The Warriors: The Beginning\\" examines the film's origins. This featurette also takes a look at the casting process including an amusing anecdote that James Remar tells of how he got the role of Ajax.<br /><br />\\"The Warriors: Battleground\\" examines the filming process. They shot mostly at night and on location in New York City. It was a tough one as principal photography took place during the summer with short nights and in rough neighbourhoods.<br /><br />\\"The Warriors: The Way Home\\" explores how the encounters with various gangs, like the Baseball Furies, was done. Cast and crew members dish some great anecdotes in this featurette.<br /><br />\\"The Warriors: Phenomenon\\" examines the end of the film, the post-production process and its enduring legacy. Fans will delight in David Patrick Kelly's recounting of how he came up with the film's most famous line.<br /><br />Sadly, no deleted scenes are included. All we get is a glimpse of the original opening scene but that's it. What a missed opportunity. This DVD does not live up to its Ultimate Director's Cut moniker./>Sadly, no deleted scenes are included. All we get is a glimpse of the original opening scene but that's it.

0064471837|5.0|When my friend told me how good this book was, I started reading it right away, though I must admit that I lacked her enthusiasm.  Two days later I had finished the book and was begging her for the second in the series.  I have never read a book that grabbed at my imagination the way that Sabriel has done.  Even now, several years after the first time I read the book, the mere mention of it makes me want to run home and read it again.  Which I do often- I just read it again last weekend.<br /><br />Though this book is meant for young readers, I would recommend it to anyone.  Whether they are fantasy readers or not.  Garth Nix's ability to bring his readers into his world, I think, is unparalleled, even by the likes of J.K. Rowling.<br /><br />A brief synopsis:  Sabriel is about to leave the school whare she has spent most of her 18 years, when a messenger from the realm of death brings news that something horrible has happened to her father, Abhorsen.  Sabriel must now leave the land she knows, Anncelstierre, and cross into the Old Kingdom, where magic and sorcery, not mechanics and logic, rule the land.  With the help of a free magic being trapped in the body of a cat named Mogget, as well as some unexpected friends, Sabriel must try and save her father, while using her unusual sword and bells to bind the increasingly dangerous dead creatures that seek to destroy the Old Kingdom.
B00005A0N5|4.0|First off, I want to state that the band Nightwish is not just Tarja Turgen's backup band. There is some very high talent in the composing of the music in this album. Oceanborn starts slow, not very impressive--- but then song after song builds the intensity to the magnus opus in the end. If you like classical music and a little metal you will be right at home here. The drumming is spectacular, and the keyboard player adds some well placed fourishes.A very high quality piece of music, go get this right now and enjoy.
B00064MW6K|1.0|Ignoring the all-important fact that the catwoman in this movie is not the same character from the comics, take a gander at the dorky catwoman mask. The gay \\"costume designer\\" who came up with that hideous thing should be banished from Hollywood forever. Although Halle Berry is an undeniably good-looking woman, she looks anything BUT appealing wearing that dorky mask. What a travesty!
B00003CXGP|5.0|After watching this movie a few times, several interpretations occurred to me. <br /> <br />1. All the killings are fantasies.  Evidence: The \\"feed-stray-cat\\" message on the ATM.  Also, the ending in which Bateman's lawyer says that he had just met the missing Paul Allen in London after the latter's supposed murder. <br /> <br />2. There was a lofty conspiracy designed to protect Bateman.  This would then make the film very political with Bateman representing unregulated, ruthless corporations and his lack of accountability representing the machinations of society which cover up the destruction and enable it.  The evidence: the ending of the film in which Reagan delivers his Iran-Contra apologia speech points the film in a markedly political direction.  The depiction of yuppie rich materialistic life implicates a larger culture of unchecked consumption: corporations and their penchant for destruction. <br /> <br />Either way, this film is a study of narcissism and moral vacuity (and perhaps something more), with Christian Bale giving a remarkable, hilarious performance.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I've been waiting for FFVII:AC since I heard of it being made.  And  its everything I've hoped for.  The emotion is still there and the music when I hear it, still seems to tear me apart in some way.  I love it, I absolutely love it. <br /> <br />I think the movie was made perfectly, camera angles and such gave it a profound effect on me, and hopefully all other viewers.  While watching the trailer for the first time and to see Sephiroth to jump down at Cloud sent cold chills down my spine. <br /> <br />I have nothing else to say about this.  I just can't wait for the U.S. release and I hope that its released in theaters just so I can see it on the silver screen.
B000055Y0X|4.0|Dr. Strangelove, made in 1964, is a comedic war movie set in the Cold War days. The whole movie starts when Colonel Jack D. Ripper goes absolutely insane. Colonel Ripper orders his U.S. Air Force bomber wing to bomb and destroy the U.S.S.R. After this order is given, the President of the United States and his advisors come together. This is where the Soviet ambassador informs him that if even one bomb is dropped it will set off a doomsday machine. The doomsday machine would basically destroy all life on Earth. Many try to help prevent this tragedy, but in the end one last plane does not receive the code \\"OPE\\" to call off the raid. Overall, I thought this movie had a very dry sense of humor. Although, there were some very comedic parts, the movie was not entirely funny. I, myself did enjoy this movie, however I would not recommend it to people in my age group, but rather to people in their 40's and older who I personally think might appreciate the satire of this movie a bit more.
B00005JO0J|1.0|Silly and trite storyline. The dialogue is silly, cliche, and <br />childish. This is like a bad-sci-fi channel original picture.
0792844890|4.0|Enjoyed every minute of it! Felt it should be PG13 for mild cursing and strong sexual inuendos.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Not the best of the Star Wars films, but still great fun!
B0002XNSY0|3.0|Some people consider Dr. Strangelove one of the funniest movies of all time. Personally, I thought that the movie was decent, considering that it was made in 1964.  The movie is basically about nuclear war and the effects that it would have if it ever happened. The main character(Colonel Jack Ripper) goes completely INSANE and sends bombs to destroy Russia. By doing this, it will start a Doomsday Machine, which will destroy every single thing in the world. <br />The whole movie was just one big, giant satire.  What the director wanted to do is show people just how stupid nuclear warfare is, and he did show a good example for that. But, some of the satires weren't good enough.  I must admit, that there were a lot of funny ones, but most of them were just plain stupid. <br />If you are young and don't comprehend things very well then I suggest you DO NOT buy this movie. But, for all you smart older people, go ahead and buy it, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it. <br />
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Having been a fan of DM for ages (since my introduction to them during my high school days back in the 1980s), it was good news to me when I heard about their intention to record a new album as afterall, it has been 4 years since their last effort. But on the other hand, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Their last few albums have had mixed reviews... 'Exciter', though a well-recorded album, was considered by many as being too experimental and lacking in Mode-styled, powerful dark-electro-dance tunes that have made them so popular... 'Ultra' contained some excellent tracks but was criticised for lacking uniformity and direction... 'Songs of Faith and Devotion' brought them to the height of their career but was a more rock-powered and less synth-laden experience. Although 'Songs of Faith and Devotion' and 'Ultra' are actually 2 of my favourite DM albums (despite some who hate them and prefer their older albums), I can't say the same for 'Exciter' as I did not particularly enjoy it when it was release, and up till today, I still feel that 'Exciter' is their weakest album to date. So, I was pretty worried about a similar sounding new album. But just a few seconds after putting the new CD into my CD player... listening to the griding industrial intro of 'A Pain That I'm Used To' and I thought... yes, definitely some potential here... and scrolling through quickly track-by-track, I wasn't disappointed. From a creative synthed-up adaptation of the traditional 'John the Relevator', to the classic Mode sounding 'Suffer Well', 'Precious' and 'Lilian', and the slower and darker tracks like 'I Want It All' and 'Damaged People', this new album does not disappoint. YES, they are definitely BACK! And most interestingly, we now have not only Martin's songs but Dave's as well (seems Dave has been promoted to songwriter after his recent solo venture). This is probably the album that will rebuild their reputation as one of the pioneers of synth-industrial pop, an album that remindsme very much of 'Violator' and 'Black Celebration'. Old fans who have given up, try this and you'll definitely forgive their past misadventures. And those from the younger generation who are unfamiliar with Depeche Mode, this is an album worth exploring if you love Nine Inch Nails. And those who love Marilyn Manson's 'Personal Jesus', also check out the aforementioned 'Violator'.
B0002XNSY0|4.0|I had to watch Dr. Strangelove in my English class this past week. This movie definitely requires a higher level of thinking in order to get all the jokes. The movie uses a lot of satire and its kind of hard to see unless you are told what to look for. I don't think this is  a \\"Oh my god! That was the funniest thing I've ever seen\\" kind of movie. Its more of a \\"Oh.. that was kinda funny...\\" sort of movie. In the movie, a billboard on base reads, \\"Peace is our Profession.\\" See, I dont find this hysterically funny but my English teacher keeps reassuring us that it is. I understand the irony of the whole thing, but its not funniest thing i've ever seen. I just don't see why it is in the top 10 funniest movies.  <br />In order to understand this movie it would also be helpful to have lived during the cold war. There is probably a lot of jokes in the movie that you would only get if you knew more about the cold war. I would not recomend this movie to younger viewers for that reason. But other than that it was a good movie. I dont think that I would choose to watch this movie on my own free time but it was nice to watch in class. I enjoyed it and I have to admit its not the worst movie I've ever seen.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|With a back catalogue stretching back 20+ years, Depeche Mode's music is most certainly going to take on different meanings to different segments of their fandom. Don't believe all the reviews saying the album is as good as \\"Violator\\" (it isn't) or all the fans screaming \\"Its the worst album ever\\" (its not). And those complaining about Alan not being in the group need to hook up with  members of the  \\"Bring Vince Back\\" support group to get them through the day.<br /><br />Depeche Mode's \\"Playing the angel\\" is a far better album than \\"exciter\\". The album is overall an imbalanced affair. The first half of the album is upbeat. OPening with a crazy bass noise that sounds like an alarm DM launch into first track \\"a pain that Im used to\\".  Lead-off single \\"Precious\\" is the best track and does invoke the \\"Violator\\" era with its melodic chorus a beautiful synths. \\"John the revelator\\" apes \\"I feel you\\" with its shouty chorus and slightly rockin sound.<br /><br />The latter half of the album gets bogged down like many reviewers say in more noise than melody and David Gahan's meandering vocals. The later songs are good but are less engaging and more like background music. Only track \\"Lilian\\" picks up the beat with a nice tempo and somewhat of a melodic chorus.<br /><br />Overall the standout tracks make this album worthwhile and the less engaging tracks are still pretty good. A solid release and much more enjoyable than \\"exciter\\".
B00008S2VG|1.0|Like many artists, during the course of their recording career, they're bound to steer off track and release an album that just doesn't cut it. \\"American Life\\" is that album for Madonna. I dislike this album with a passion. I gave it 1 star for \\"Die another day\\" the ONLY track I own and it's the remixed dance version. Madonna needs to focus on good dance music. A ballad here and there is okay, but let's face it, Madonna is best known for her dance music and awesome remixes. She starts getting political on us and it turns me off. Just sing good dance songs and leave the political BS for politicians-and Bono from U2. This album has no appeal or charm. The music is too simple. Very Mickey Mouse if you will. Let's put it this way, \\"I'm Breathless\\" is a better album than \\"American Life\\". And \\"Im Breathless\\" got really bad reviews and a bad rap when it was initially released. Madonna has grown on me musically from \\"Erotica\\" to the present. I look forward to Madonna's new album \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" due out November 15, 2005. Apparently, it's a continuous mix album (no spaces between tracks in case you're wondering) with Madonna doing what she does best--DANCE MUSIC!

B000B0WODA|4.0|Review no. 59. Now, I can honestly see what all the hoopla is about. Seems that as time goes by, you do hear more about this Scottish alternative indie pop band. 'You Could...' is their second effort. Get it while they're hot. Notice this CD has a Beatles-esque sound and vibe to it. Tracks I liked best were \\"The Fallen\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\", the well-written \\"I'm Your Villian\\" and \\"Outsiders\\". Line-up: Alex Kapranos - guitar & vocals, Nick McCarthy - guitar, Bob Hardy - bass and Paul Thomas - drums. Might appeal to fans of Electric Six, Interpol, The Strokes, Joy Division and The Killers. Do check it out.

B0002IU988|5.0|While maybe a little generic for some people, and some tracks sound a little too similar to Creed, this album has much more shredding and better guitar work than Creed. The vocals are also clearer and sound better than Creed. A great hard rock album with maybe even a touch of metal.
B00003CX8U|4.0|The reason I bought the CD is that I really wanted to review the stages a person moves through when dealing with the loss of a loved one as well as the loss of their own life. The dancing, singing, and love story illustrate these stages as a celebration rather than a tragedy. I believe that the CD gives an excellent education on a taboo subject.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Every single song on this disc is amazing. This albums is perfect in so many ways. It's loud, it's quiet, it's soft, it's hard. Some of the songs may seem a little long at times, but it's not a big issue. There is so much going on in each song that it takes alot of listens to get the whole thing. Definetly buy it, whether you like classic Dream Theater or are into power metal you will love it.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I knew this movie was being made long before its trailer hit theaters. Not knowing who the cast, writer and director would be, I was very afraid of a repeat attempt at the kind of Batman that 1997's \\"Batman & Robin\\" punished us with. As soon as more info came in and I eventually saw the film. I couldn't believe it. Not only is this a dramatic improvement over the last Batman film, its arguably the best comic book-adaptation film ever made. Being treated like a credible film, you sometimes get the impression you are watching a creepy, gripping psychological drama rather than just a comic-film. Rather than its special effects, stunts, or over-the-top music that drives it; this is helmed by a superior cast and a great script to match. Not to mention the perfect portrayal of the story by director Chris Nolan. Christian Bale simply IS BATMAN! This is Batman the way that Bob Kane originally intended. It is the most exciting, dramatic and emotionally gripping of any of the more recent comic book films, certainly of all of the Batman movies. If you must judge what the Batman character was really meant to be from a movie, make it this one! I'm sure glad I've all the other films first, or this one would make them look like a let-down. DO NOT RENT IT! BUY IT! By, the way, the special features will keep you up watching for hours also. They pretty much hold the same structure as the rereleases of the first four films.
B000002H33|5.0|This album will go down in history as one of the greatest metal albums of all time, no doubt about that, along with Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\".
B00000IREA|3.0|having a producer husband is not a guarantee of a good career move.  This movie is mostly for Jane Fonda fans.

I know there are people who think its dumb and don't get it. Well YOUR WRONG!! AND YOU SUCK its the best. Deffinately buy this. <br /> <br />Your Napoleon Dynamie expert, <br />Jacob
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This movie was awesome.  No wonder this is Quentin Tarantino's favorite movie.  The best scene in this movie has to be the ending: the standoff.  Everything fit right into place.  Sergio Leone was a great director.  Ennio Morricone's score was deftly entertaining.  From beginning to end, this was a great picture.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I've known about the game since it's debut in 1997 and have played it a great number of times (I've lost count, in fact!  LOL) since I got my own copy in 1999.  Long have I awaited to see this great game turn into a live action movie instead of having to put up with The Spirits Within forever.  Advent Children finally gives an insight to the intriguing yet confusing ending to the game that have left many in wonder as to what really happened after Holy battled Meteor over Midgar.   <br /> <br />Those who haven't played the PSX game at least once or twice all the way thru or haven't put at least 50 hours or more into it might not appreciate it as the die-hard fans of the game, but it is still very good and highly recommended to any fan of Final Fantasy.  And for those who can obtain the DVD extra of Final Fantasy:  Last Order (int'l version only, unfortunately), it is very much worth finding, as it explains the events during and after Nibelheim 5 years previous to the gametime.   <br /> <br />Overall, I'm very impressed with Advent Children.
B000AA305M|1.0|The CD will not play on an IPOD.  I sent it back
0812550706|5.0|is the greatest book ive ever read in all my life. Yea, the book may sound corny if you read the back of the book, but this book is so awesome. You will soon realize that the main character is struggling with a lot of stuff other then what the back said. You have teo go and read this book to really under stand it. The main character is always struggling with friends, and rankings, and it makes it a good book that you want to keepe on reading once your about a chapter or so in. He is expected to to great things and.. well, you should go get the book now, im not going to give EVERYTHING away. <br /> <br />-Dino Hayes
B000B7HZXM|5.0|\\"Success is great, but even sweeter when you get to experience it with the gifted, passionate, hardworking and - equally important to me - fun-loving professionals at J Records. And just think, this is only Volume IV.\\"  ~ Rod Stewart ~<br /><br />My friends and I have been anticipating the release of Rod Stewart's fourth of a series of Great American Songbook ever since Steve Tyrell (one of the album producers with Clive Davis) made an announcement about it during his concert at the Starlight Bowl in July of this year.  Finally, the wait is over - for now - that is! It's so great to know that we're in for more wonderful Volumes to come. What he said about this being only Volume IV is an assurance that there will be more to look forward to. Recently, before this CD was released, I watched him perform on Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he sang \\"I Wish You Love\\" and CNN's Larry King Live where he sang \\"Long Ago And Far Away\\" to the delight of the viewers.<br /><br />This fabulous recording presents a new set of gorgeous and timeless standards. Topping my list is a lovely song that brings back a chock-full of memories to me, \\"My One And Only Love,\\" featuring Roy Hargrove on trumpet. This is also one of the songs I mentioned in my review on Volume I that I wish he would record. Thanks so kindly, Mr. Stewart for including this charming ditty in this repertoire of beautiful classics. An added delight to this recording is the presence of the equally talented guest artists, the likes of Diana Ross, Elton John, Chaka Khan, Chris Botti, George Benson, Dave Koz and Roy Hargrove, as well as a versatile musician and the main man, Alan Broadbent, who splendidly arranged and conducted the magnificent Orchestra. The credit also goes to Bob Mann, a fine guitarist/keyboardist/arranger, who co-produced and arranged this album and the rest of the musicians - Kenny Ascher (piano), Ed Howard (bass), Allan Schwartzberg (drums), David Finck (bass), Dan Higgins (clarinet) and Warren Luening (trumpet).<br /><br />My favorites include Gershwins' \\"I've Got A Crush On You,\\" a delightful duet with the Queen of Motown, Diana Ross. After all these years her voice is still great. Hers is a kind of voice that doesn't change with the passing of time. Their duet is one of the highlights and blended perfectly with this gem of a song. The duet with Chaka Khan \\"You Send Me\\" is also remarkable and deserves a special mention. All the tracks are absolutely noteworthy and are on my \\"Listmania Lists.\\"  It's one CD that you want to listen all the way through without skipping any track at all. And these songs are my late parents' music that I've been hearing when I was growing up and were glued to my ears all these years and became my all-time favorites.  The best tracks for me are  \\"I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm,\\" \\"Nevertheless, I'm In Love With You,\\" \\"Makin' Whoopee\\" (a terrific duet with Elton John), \\"Blue Skies\\" (I love Bob Mann's guitar intro), \\"My Funny Valentine,\\" \\"Taking A Chance On Love\\" and \\"Let's Fall In Love,\\" a composition by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler and featuring the guitar artistry of George Benson.<br /><br />\\"Let's close our eyes<br />And make our own paradise<br />Little we know of it<br />Still we can try to make a go of it<br />We might have been made for each other<br />To be or not to be, let our hearts discover\\"<br /><br />I would classify this as one of my 'Desert Island CDs' along with the first three of his Great American Songbook series. This is one of Rod Stewart's CDs that you'll enjoy listening to \\"not for just an hour, not for just a day, not for just a year but always, always!\\"<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend it for your listening pleasure! ;)<br /><br />* * * * * TEN STARS * * * * *My favorites include Gershwins' \\"I've Got A Crush On You,\\" a delightful duet with the Queen of Motown, Diana Ross.

B000B2YQX4|2.0|....or Music For the Masses....or Black celebration.... <br /> <br />Is it a bad album?  No.  Not at all.  It is just an example of an older band making music that doesn't really hit the mark.  It's normal to make comparisons to older classic albums, but those are often heights that just can't be reached again. <br /> <br />The songs on Playing The Angel are filled to the brim with pretentious vocals.  Gahan still wallows in his own misery, which is pretty typical.  The music doesn't really catch your ear though.  It's slow and even jarring at times.  Basically, it's boring.  If you're a huge DM fan, you'll want it.  Just don't get your hopes up too much.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|gone are the campy over the top villans of the last movie series.  no adam west silliness either.  here we have a story in which we can suspend our disbelief and actually get into the character of bruce wayne/batman.  the previous celluloid batmen were little more than cardboard cutouts, but this one lives and breathes.  i was a bit skeptical about the new batmobile design but after seeing it in action i am now a believer.  i hope this is the beginning of a long and fruitful franchise for the venerable dark knight.  the bonus features on the second disk were informative and enjoyable with several mini-documentaries about set and costume design, action sequences, and a very nice segment about the comic writers and artists that were the most inspirational for this film.  the bonus comic is also a nice addition to the package.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|Wow. This is such a great album. Track breakdown as seen by me: <br /> <br />The Dagger - 5/5 - Howard Jones of Killswitch Engage adds his voice to this track which I think is great. Starts heavy and doesn't stop.  <br /> <br />The Enemy - 4/5 - Got a kind of Static X vibe to it. I like the vocals by Chimaira's Mark Hunter. Also guitar and bass heavy drums go together very well. <br /> <br />Annihilation by the hands of God - 5/5 - Not the usual style of Metal I listen to but I really like this track. Sung by Deicide frontman Glen Benton who growls out this tracks awesome lyrics. Love the drums by Joey Jordinson of Slipknot, guy is a god when he's got the sticks in his hands. <br /> <br />In the Fire - 4/5 - Also not my usual metal style. More old school vocals but I like it. Matt Heafy of Trivium rips on the guitar while legend King Diamond wails.  <br /> <br />The End - 5/5 - This is the first song I heard when I heard about this album, was on Roadrunner's website. songs gives you the chills. Trivium front man Matt Heafy does it again. <br /> <br />Tired n' Lonely - 3/5 - More of a alternative rock style song with the vocals by Life of Agony's Keith Caputo. Still like it though.  <br /> <br />Independant - 4/5 - After 2 contrast songs it's right back into the heavy stuff. Great song. Cavelara of Soulfly's voice really shines on this song. <br /> <br />Dawn of a Golden Age - 1/5 - I'm sorry I just don't like Dani Filth's voice. He creeps me out. Have listened to this song many times and it gets better toward the middle of this song where during the chorus he loses his goth wail but I still usually skip this one.  <br /> <br />The Rich Man - 4/5 - Would have given this a 3 but Slipknot/Stone Sour front man Corey Taylor belts this one out. Got the Stone Sour style light singing then into the Slipknot style screaming. Good stuff. <br /> <br />No Way Out - 3/5 - A punky/emo style song here. Not really a fan of this. Would have gotten a 2 if Jordinson wasn't behind thedrums. <br /> <br />Baptized in the Redemption - 5/5 - Back into heavy we go. Awesome song. Fafara of Devil Driver puts his vocals behind this one and its a great one.  <br /> <br />Roads - 3/5 - Two man ballad with vocals by Opeth's Kerfeldt and Type O Negative's Josh Silver behind the keyboards. Like it but usually skip it unless im in the mood for a slower song with some classical background. <br /> <br />Blood and Flames - 5/5 Ex-Killswitch Engage singer Jesse Leach sings with the man Heafy on the axe. I really like this song with Leach's older style high and low singing.  <br /> <br />Enemy of the State - 2/5 - Slow wierd song sung in I'm guessing...Swedish or German or something? Too lazy too look it up so if it's English I'm sorry...im just retarded. Usually a skip unless I'm in the mood for a slow one.  <br /> <br />I don't wanna be a Superhero - 5/5 - GREAT song. Ex-Misfits lead singer Michael Graves adds his punk style vocals to who else but Heafy's guitar which turns into a punk/metal mix which is very pleasing to my ears. <br /> <br />Army of the Sun - 5/5 - Had never heard of Bloodsimple until I looked them up after hearing Tim Williams vocals on this one. LOVE this song, slow start then into a thrashy ballad style song. The end where it goes from talk singing into full thrash shredding is great. <br /> <br />No Mas Control - 4/5 - Ill Nino's singer Cristian Machado puts his latin style singing behind this one switching from english to spanish while hes singing this one. Good stuff. <br /> <br />Constitution Down - 3/5 - High and low vocals again from Floodgate's Kyle Thomas but in a narrower range then Leech's on BLood and Flames. Still strong.  <br /> <br />Overall this is a great album from possibly the greatest metal label on the earth Roadrunner. To have such talent collaborate and make music like this is every metal heads dream. This cd will stay playing until my ears bleed. Metal forever \m/
B00000APLB|5.0|It is common opinion (and, by the way, I agree with it) that \\"Love you live\\" and \\"Get yer ya ya's out\\" are probably Stones' best live albums. Nevertheless, as for the \\"inspiration\\" and the characters of these works, there are some important differences: if, on the one hand, \\"Get yer ya ya's out\\" is a solid, compact and upright rock and roll record, on the other hand  \\"Love you live\\" seems to be more nervous and powerful, maybe because of the age of the recording (1977: echoes from the punk movement?), sketching a various and full-of-energy profile of the Band through a double set record. Talking about some tracks in detail, the CD, after the ouverture \\"Fanfare for the common man\\", starts with \\"Honky tonk women\\" (one of its best-known versions), followed by \\"If you can't rock me\\"/\\"Get off of my cloud\\" (mixed together) and \\"Happy\\", that let the listener almost breathless. After such highlights as \\"You can't always get what you want\\" (after Ron Wood's solo, the crowd in Paris and Mick Jagger singing together the chorus: thrills...) and the side recorded at \\"El Mocambo\\", the final rush with \\"It's only R'N'R'\\", \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and \\"Brown sugar\\" (and others, of course) is the knock-out punch. Add some classics (\\"Tumbling dice\\", etc.) and the result is a milestone in the rock and roll landscape.

B00028HBKM|4.0|This film portrays the very graphic and disturbing final 12 hours of the life of Jesus as authenticaly as possible primarily following the gospels of Mathew, Mark, luke and John.  Minimal subtitles fill in what might not be infered through the visual story telling.  The dialog is in Aramic and latin. There are a few flashbacks that give a sense of personal investment for the viewer of the the man being horribly ravaged by the Roman's who heartlessly beat and physicaly torture the man repeatedly for the bulk of the film.  Given this last 12 hours concept little is revealed of the miraculous or divine nature of the Christ as the title assures him to be.  We do see a passionate and strong spritual being in the garden being tempted by satan and are re-assured again of Jesus as divine at one other time.  Other than that his divine nature could possibly be missed and we are given Jesus as man which was how he was to endure humanity's wrath.  The image's are brutal and relentless.  The satanic images are searing and frightening and the film does reference material from outside the gospel which keep the satanic imagery included throughout the film from what I have read.  The point of this film seems to have been to leave an indelable mark on the collective conciousness of this generation and its should definately succeed.  I was shaken by both the film and it's success.  The only thing missing was a better understanding of his message of love that was so incriminating at year 0.
B000002B7O|5.0|Many people say that Blizzard of Ozz was Ozzy's greatest, I disagree. It was his second solo album, Diary of a Madman, that truly raised him to a level of metal god worship by not just the fans, but by fellow metal artists too. Sure there may have been some who opposed (Robert Plant, Ronnie James Dio, and Black Sabbath to name a few) but for the most part the whole metal community rallied to their once worshipped hero and then raised him to metal godhood. This is mostly thanks to the musical direction of Randy Rhoads and Bob Daisley (who sadly gets screwed over later over some legal crap I can't describe) from classic metal with some pop elements thrown in to just full out metal assault.<br /><br />Track Listing:<br /><br />1.Over the Mountain: One of the heaviest openers ever. The drum intro by Lee Kerslake is amazing, its almost as if it were god on drums. Then there is the awesome guitar solo spot by Randy Rhoads. They somehow threw some Sabbath elements in and then turned it into a full out metal song. Defines metal assault.<br /><br />2.Flying High Again: Amazing song with amazing lyrics. You can tell that Daisley, Ozzy and Randy threw alot of thought into the lyrical structure of this song. The bass line is also great on this song too as Bobby almost pulls off a Gene Simmons like riff while Randy Rhoads pulls off one of his megalomanic solos.<br /><br />3.You Can't Kill Rock n' Roll: A true tribute to rock n'roll. It's about those who waste their time b#$chin about rock music and those who play rock music. A true Ozzy epic with like 3 Rhoads solos that are simply artistic.<br /><br />4.Believer: A heavy hitter of a song which sounds dark and yet powerful with a bit of finger thrown in. Don't listen to that crap I just wrote: It is a heavy song with heavy feeling, that is all you need to know.<br /><br />5.Little Dolls: An amazingly overtly metal song. The drums on this are out of this world as well as Randy's squeling guitar thromp that is prominent all the way through. Ozzy chooses only the best to play with the best.<br /><br />6.Tonight: The true power ballad on the album, about the performance the band pulls off... tonight. He has no worries tonight.<br /><br />7.SATO: Apparently this stands for the women in Ozzy's life. His flame and manager and then his exwife. But how in the blue hell do they relate to a friggn sea voyage? Who friggn cares! The guitars on this track are awesome and even though it is fast paced I have to say it is one of my favorites.<br /><br />8.Diary of a Madman: The definitive Ozzy song: it is dark, spooky, and insane. It begins with an acoustic opener, but you know it is not going to stay that way. It starts out calm and slow paced, but you that is definitely going to friggn change. You think you will survive it, but you won't.

0316172324|5.0|Wish I read the book in my twenties.  I had other interests at that age and probably wouldn't have understood it.
B000000OSG|5.0|You know how there are all of those Led Zeppelin addicts who claim that their band is one of the greatest things ever in history. Well I guess you can say the same for Use Your Illusion II by Guns n' Roses, except for that unlike the Zepps this is a FACT! Seriously folks, this is an accomplishment on the level of Magna Carta. If Use Your Illusion I was a great album then this album is EPIC in nature. I would also like to take this time to address something I didn't get to in my Use Your Illusion I review: the band did not go soft in Use Your Illusion, they went f#$king fast and aggresive! Sure there may have been ballads, but how many rockers did you see? Probably every song except November Rain and Don't Cry rocked your @ss off! So shut up!<br /><br />Track Listing:<br /><br />1.Civil War: One of GnR's greatest songs, but then again you could say the same for about half of their songs. This epic focuses on the Vietnam War, although it happened like 15 years before this song was written. Izzy and Slash are at their musically best form on this track. But UYI I Live in TOkyo and this album RIGHT NOW! 10/10<br /><br />2.14 Years: Unlike Dust n' Bones, this song seems offkilter. Sure it has some great guitar riffs but Izzy's singing just seems out of form when put next to his previous vocal work. 9/10<br /><br />3.Yesterdays: A great folky blues type song. 10/10<br /><br />4.Knockin on Heaven's Door: Out of all covers they could have done, WTF Bob Dylan? It's a great song but I can see why they would need to add the tape insert in the song, the lyrics are just too unoriginal for me to call this great, but I just did so I guess I have to at least give it 8/10.<br /><br />5.Get in the Ring: THis is the MOST ANGRY SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD. JUST HEARING IT MAKES ME WANT TO KICK SOMEONES @SS! Axl is at his most absolute pissed off state and it is awesome, even the drums sound really pissed off! Everything in this song is pissed off, the guitar tone is like Aerosmith and Rolling Stones mixed together while the lyrics are like Perfect Crime mixed with Miracle Man, aggresive-fueled and really insulting. 11/10<br /><br />6.Shotgun Blues: Pathetic, cuss rock. First off the rhythm guitar work is pathetic (courtesy of Axl Rose, at least he is not Kurt Cobain.), WTF was Axl thinking! Just let Izzy do it! Then there is the lyrics, seems like the only reason this song was written was so that Axl could cuss his butt off. really pathetic, for gnr. 4/10<br /><br />7.Breakdown: Awesome song, the likeness of it has not been seen since the days of Sweet Child of Mine. Slash is just awesome on this track, the only track he does better in would be Estranged. The excerpt from Vanishing Point keeps this song from being as great as it could've been. 9.8/10<br /><br />8.Pretty Tied Up(The Perils of Rock n' Roll Decadence): I think that this song could have been better if not for the weird banjo work. Stil a great song thanks to Duff's bass work. 9/10<br /><br />9.Locomotion(complicity): What the Hell! GnR is not funkmetal, and never will be! this is one of the greatest waste of 9 minutes ever! did they run out of ideas for epic?! They could have just done a cover of Machine Gun or Free Bird or some crap besides this! 5/10<br /><br />10.So Fine: Luckily this album is saved from being destroyed by Locomotion by this extroadinary song in which Duff does vocals. It is in my opinion one of GnRs greatest songs, and I would easily put it in their top 8 dare say top 5. You would never think Duff could sing so good but he does and it is in my opinion better than Izzy and dare say mentionable next to Axl, even though that is asking alot. 11/10<br /><br />11.Estranged: Just when you thought this album couldn't get anymore greater, this song happens. Slash guitar work is the one of the greatest guitar work I have ever heard, someone once said that this was the Stairway to Heaven of the 90's, that is a load of crap, this is more like the Machine Gun of the 90's. This songis by far Guns n' Roses greatest song and if there could be anything said about Guns n' Roses all I would say is \\"Estranged\\". They could have made an album with nothing but extreme crap beyond reason and if this track was on it the album would still be called one of the greatest albums ever made. The greatest 10 minutes I ever spent was listening to this track for the first time on my way to Washington for a family reunion. If I were you I would buy the album just for this song and then get another copy for someone you really cared about. This is the song I am going to play at my wedding, my children's birth, when they graduate, and at my funeral. I would compare this accomplishment to the invention of the alphabet at least. Unrateable.<br /><br />12.You Could be Mine: After such an extroadinary event like Estranged this song probably seems like absolute crap, if you played The Wall after Estranged it would seem like crap! But this track does the best to offset the aftermath of Estranged with more of Slash's greatest guitar work and Axl's lyrics. For at least trying to fit in as the song after Estranged: 11/10<br /><br />13.Don't Cry(Alt. Version): In my opinion, the better version of Don't Cry. The original version is just a \\"I love you baby\\" type of song, this one is more emotive. It is like as if they had Bob Daisley writing their music! All writing jokes aside this song is great and it is a shame that the only place you can hear it is one this album and the UYI best of album. 12/10<br /><br />I am not going to even mention My World, let's pretend like it doesn't even exist. All I can say is that Shotgun Blues and Locumtion are legendary compared to it.<br /><br />I came up with this ranking system when I reviewed No Rest for the Wicked where I rank this album in comparison to the other albums by the same artist. However, unlike Ozzy, Guns n' Roses only has about 7 albums that has song material on them and one of them is a greatest hits so we only need a best of 6 albums.<br /><br />Best to Worst:<br /><br />1.Use Your Illusion II<br /><br />2.Use Your Illusion I<br /><br />3.Appetite for Destruction<br /><br />4.Live Era: '87-'93<br /><br />5.GnR Lies<br /><br />6.The Spaghetti Incident?<br /><br />There is no reason to buy the Greatest Hits collection, just get a job and buy all six of these great albums and make your own best of! and if you want Sympathy for the Devil look in a secondhand record store, it's bound to be in there.ould be anything said about Guns n' Roses all I would say is \\"Estranged\\". They could have made an album with nothing but extreme crap beyond reason and if this track was on it the album would still be called one of the greatest albums ever made.

All I can say is that Shotgun Blues and Locumtion are legendary compared to it. <br /> <br />I came up with this ranking system when I reviewed No Rest for the Wicked where I rank this album in comparison to the other albums by the same artist. However, unlike Ozzy, Guns n' Roses only has about 7 albums that has song material on them and one of them is a greatest hits so we only need a best of 6 albums. <br />Best to Worst: <br />1.Use Your Illusion II <br />2.Use Your Illusion I <br />3.Appetite for Destruction <br />4.Live Era: '87-'93 <br />5.GnR Lies <br />6.The Spaghetti Incident? <br />There is no reason to buy the Greatest Hits collection, just get a job and buy all six of these great albums and make your own best of! and if you want Sympathy for the Devil look in a secondhand record store, it's bound to be in there.
B000B9EY2U|2.0|Do you remember when Andrew Fletcher was quoted as saying that in his opinion, Exciter would be Depeche Mode's \\"best album since Black Celebration?\\"  Recently, I eagerly reviewed my copy of their follow-up album Playing the Angel, optimistic that this would not be Exciter 2.  THAT album suffered from under-production, gratuituous and annoying blips and bleeps, and an overall lack of energy - indeed no Black Celebration.   At first glance, Angel's producer, Ben Hillier, has attempted to address some of these issues, bringing back DM's signature guitar licks and butching up the lower register.  Unfortunately though, a new coat of paint just isn't enough to save this sinking ship.    <br />  DM seem to have taken the most awful bits from Exciter and made them that much worse on this record (such as opening with a dreadful Dead of Night inspired riff).   Martin's gratuitous use of midi produced noises, experimental song structure, and inexplicable gaps of silence or static make enjoying the otherwise tuneful ballads nearly impossible.  With the exception of the album's first delicious single Precious and possibly Suffer Well -- sitting like oases in the desert --  the entire landscape between A Pain That I'm Used To and The Darkest Star is a wasteland of misapplied guitar distortion, false starts, and ditty, minimalist sounds cooked up like unfinished demos on a $5 drum machine -- ala Counterfeit 2 with a bass line.   Frankly, I'm embarrassed to add this to my collection.   Where are the beat/drum loops and the innovative sampling that made this band so cutting edge once upon a time?  What happened to the slick production quality from pre-millennial efforts? <br />    So this time around, I took Fletch's most recently expressed confidence \\"that this album will be up there as one of our best\\" with a grain of salt.  Turns out to have been a good thing.  In this post-Wilder era of the band's career, Depeche Mode is becoming a pain that I'm reluctantly getting used to.  2Stars.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's debut forever changed the landscape of rock n' roll. Of course it brought guitar rock back to the charts but it is also responsible for bringing concert monsters like Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith off the top of the mountain with Eddie's guitar work that made guys like Eric Clapton, Jimi Paige and Joe Perry seem like babies with broken fingers playing guitar. Also, guitar tapping is harder than it looks, i've tried it before and ended up in the hospital for cutup fingers. Also the pure virtuositiy of ALex and Micheal made up for the band's amazing rhythm section. Most rhythm sections just add ambience to a band but in Van Halen theirs pratically played like guitar noise.<br />Track Listing:<br /><br />1.Runnin' with the Devil: The quintessential opener and great rocker. In the era of this song most rock acts were blues inspired but this made everything straight out rock riffs.<br />2.Eruption: PERHAPS THE GREATEST GUITAR SOLO EVER! IT IS IMPOSSIBLE, JUST TRY IT! I WOULD LOVE TO SEE \\"LEGENDS\\" LIKE PAIGE, PERRY, CLAPTON, OR COBAIN TRY TO DO THIS.<br />3.You Really Got Me: THe first real cover version of this song to get it right. Almost every version except this one is crappy, this one adds another dimension to it, making it twice as rockin as before.<br />4.Aint talkin' bout love: The quintessential Rothera song. All the others are great and all but this one defines the late 70's era where Van Halen just started their disco-killing.<br />5.I'm the One: Great boogy beat guitar rock! DLRs partyman lyrics mixed with bigband inspired riffs make this a must listen.<br />6.Jamie's Cryin': This is probably the song that can be created with the creation of hair metal in the early 80's. With the womp bass continual and the medium-high pitched guitar work and sex-driven vocals, it would go onto inspire party bands of the 80's.<br />7.Atomic Punk: Perhaps an attempt to throw salt at the wound of the punk movement. Punk used to be the big think until this happened, it prided itself on fast guitar but seeing that Eddie's is like 8 times as fast it is reasonable to call it the Atomic Punk. One of Van Halen's most metal songs ever.<br />8.Feel Your Love Tonight: Partyman boogy with incessant guitar riffs. The trademark chant \\"feel your love tonight\\" is also another great influence to the rise of hair metal.<br />9.Little Dreamer: A surprisingly Aero-influenced song. THe beginning riffs and vocal work seem reminiscent of late 70's influenced Asmith work. A genuinely great song.<br />10.Ice Cream Man: Begins with an acoustic intro that quickly turns into hard rockin plasma blast balls to the walls rock n roll. The greatest part of the track would be the suggestive lyrical structure: what the author is selling? (hahahahaha!)<br />11.On Fire: All out rocker. Van Halen at their meanest and heaviest. Plus Dave saying: \\"In your head\\" \\"In your Pants\\" in the high falsetto voice of his makes this a VH classic you must hear to believe.<br /><br />Further note: Some unaccepting 70's rock fan made a dumb@ss remark about how crappy Eddie's playing was and that its hair rock. FIrst off, VH is not hair rock. For your information Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple are crap next to this. I would love to see Ritchie Blackmore or Jimi Paige attempt to play an intro to any CVH song and see if they last the first 15 seconds. The difference between Eddie and earlier guitarists is that he wasn't spending half his time \\"Dazed and Confused\\" while inhaling \\"Smoke in the Water\\". THe only reason why Paige is even in the top 10 guitarist list is because he played a friggn Les Paul with an bum@ss violin string! Face it 70's fans, you are just bitter that VH kicked the living Hell out of all of your bands and that Joe Perry and Jimi Paige could no longer sell crap at stadiums or venues. Quit living in the past and accept the fact that sure classic rock is good but Metal kicked the living crap out of it. You should move on with your life, if a trend of music takes the main stage dont bash it to death without a second listen. When Nirvana hit the scene was I pissed? Yes because they absolutely suck. But all the other alternative music I was cool with because I gave them all second chances (I gave Nevermind 4 chances that is like $40 over 10 years on a piece of crap record so don't say I didn't give Nirvana a chance). If you give this piece of rock history a chance your music taste will develop more.<br /><br />Here is how I rank Van Halen from best to worst:<br />1.Fair Warning<br />2.Women and Children First<br />3.Van Halen<br />4.1984<br />5.Van Halen II<br />6.Diver Down<br />7.5150<br />8.For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge<br />9.Balance<br />10.OU812<br />11.Live: Right Here, Right Now<br />Yes, I will even put VHIII on this list 12.Van Halen IIINirvana hit the scene was I pissed?

B00003CXA2|5.0|It's a movie that takes you on a journey through a young man's life and what challenges he goes through.  There's a great mix of comedy and drama and you definitely connect with the characters.  Tom Hanks and Sally Field do a wonderful job-a must see for everyone!
B00025ETIW|3.0|I have to say, I originally hated this band, because it's fans were pseudo-punks who liked crap like Simple Plan and Papa Roach. I heard a block of MCR on the radio, and they actually sounded pretty good, so I picked up this CD. <br />It sounds a lot like post-Art of Drowning AFI, with a layer of gloss on it. The guitar work isn't memorable, but it isn't bad, either. Bass and drums are solid, and simple. <br />The vocals are alright most of the time, but sometimes they get so freakin' sentimental, it's embarassing. That, and the album title and some of the song titles are ridiculous and too long. They remind me of Engrish. I can't wait til they come out with the new single \\"All Your Base Are Belong To Us\\". <br />To sum it all up, if they shortened their titles, and stopped acting like suicide girls, they'd be a fairly solid act.
B0000028RR|3.0|RATM's self-titled debut shattered the walls between rock and rap. The sound was no less revolutionary than the lyrics Zack de la Rocha spewed into the microphone.  <br />In retrospect, this album is less developed and more raw than later albums. That is not neccesarily a problem. Battle of Los Angeles, for example, comparitvely seems too packaged...too limited. This is RATM in all their anger and fury. In later albums, one could not hear Zack growling into the mic at blistering levels. Tom Morello became too original...making too many distracting sounds. This is really RATM at their rawest.  <br />With that said, this album lacks the variety of other albums. Many of the songs blend together and the only noticable difference becomes the meaningless slogans (Freedom yeah right, you gotta take the power back, like a bullet in the head, f*ck you I won't do what you tell me, etc.)Only a few songs really stand out. Others lack a certain refinement and eventually just get annoying.  <br />Bombtrack was a quasi-single, but does get grating after a while. Like the rest of the album, but unlike later RATM albums, it has a bit of a jazzy feel (the two main riffs are actually just a F sharp blues scale). <br />Killing in the Name is one of the strongest songs on the album. Here RATM gives us some alternate tuning (drop D for you guitar/bass players) that would appear on later records, but is only used once on this album. <br />Take the Power back is a mediocre song that only diferentiates itself by the slap bass sound Timmy C uses. Its a good little riff, but a poor song. <br />Settle for Nothing manages to be even more average than take the power back. Unfortunantly, it doesn't even have a good riff. <br />Bullet in the Head is one of the best songs on the album. It builds up into a bestial yell at the end that is not matched on any of RATM later records. <br />Know your Enemy is average. It is the second (and last?) time we hear Timmy C playing some slap bass. There is alsoa guest appearence by Maynard from Tool. <br />Wake Up has gained a lot of notoriety for its appearence on the Matrix. It's considered by most to be the best song on the album. The main riff is certainly catchy and sounds like something out of a Led Zeppelin song (Kashmir anyone?) The only problem is that the song seems out of place. All of the other songs sound very similar, but this in its structure and in its groove is very different. Perhaps if the song didn't appear in the middle of the album this would not be so noticable (People of the Sun is similary an oddity in Evil Empire, but nobody notices it because it is at the begging). <br />Fistful of Steel, Township Rebellion, and Freedom are a poor finish to an above average album. The first two become simply irritating. Freedom has the benefit of another guttaral climax at the end of the song to finish off the album. <br /> <br />RATM was not together for very long when they made this album and it shows. The drumming is not as consistent in other albums. Timmy C was very experimental, but Tom Morello did not have the confidence to do the wierd stuff he would do later. In my opinion, this is Zack's vocally strongest album and he really carries the band. I really would have preferred to hear his yelling in later albums, but he apparently gave up on it after this one. <br />All in all, a good effort. I would buy Evil Empire before getting this album, but I still feel that this album is more interesting than Battle of Los Angeles. For those of you who like Audioslave, I would suggest (well I would really suggest buying a Soundgarden album) buying Battle of Los Angeles because it has more of the definitive wierd noises of Tom Morello.
B000AAJTL6|5.0|Awesome!  Great view on the PSP, and my four year old son loves it.  Hope Pixar continues doing these beyond Incredibles.
B000002BE9|2.0|Standing alone this CD is a strong effort. However, it pales in comparison to her later works. <br />The main problem with the album is a lack of consistency, repetitive song structure, and generally an understandable immaturity and lack of confidence from Apple herself. <br />The strength of the album is in the beginning. Apple's first single, Sleep to Dream, is catchy and original and one of the best songs Apple has ever written. Unfortunantly the rest of the album does not continue this trend. Only three songs of the remaining 9 are really noteworthy. Shadowboxer, another single, in my opinion is only an above average song. Perhaps on another album its mellowness would have stood out, but on Tidal Shadowboxer doesn't seem very special. Witht the fourth song we hear the climax of the album, Criminal. This is an absolutely fantastic song and probably the one Apple is best known for. In Criminal, Apple displays a confidence that was absent from the rest of the album and is present on later albums. <br />After Criminal, the CD begins its decline. The rest of the songs are not really that special and seem more like filler than anything else. Here, Apple's lack of sophistication in her writing really comes through. Never is a promise, Pale September, and Carrion are interesting songs, but they really don't have the punch of her hits earlier in the album. While lyrically these songs are still nothing short of poetry, musically they are too simplistic.  <br /> <br />Although this is probably Apple's most popular album, it really lacks the maturity and consistency of later albums. When the Pawn... would show the world what Apple was capable of and deserves its place as one of the best albums of all time. Her new album, Extraordinary Machine, is more experimental, but still more consistent and interesting than Tidal (although it lacks a real hit like Criminal or Sleep to Dream).  <br />I would advise to not buy this CD unless you realy enjoy Apple's mellower side. If you like the singles Criminal or Sleep to Dream I would say just buy those songs from Itunes or something. However, if you like the slow sound of songs of Shadowboxer, you might get more enjoyment out of this album.

THE SPOOKIEST PART OF THIS FILM, BESIDES THE CLASSIC SCORE BY DIRECTOR JOHN CARPENTER, IS A SILENT KILLER IN A SNOW WHITE MASK WITH A SHOCK OF HAIR AND ALMOST NON-EXISTENT EYES.  IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THIS FILM, THEN THIS IS THE EDITION YOU WANT.  IT HAS ALMOST EVERY IMAGINABLE GOODIE YOU COULD WANT.  THE ONLY THING LACKING IS THE HALLOWEEN DOCUMENTARY FEATURED ON THE RESTORED VHS WITH THE HOLOGRAPHIC COVER.  THIS FILM ALSO DOES NOT FEATURE THE MADE-FOR-TV FOOTAGE THAT YOU CAN GET BY PURCHASING A COPY OF THE DVD WITH THE TV FOOTAGE.  IF YOU ARE A FAN OF MODERN HORROR--GET THIS MOVIE!!!!
0195170776|3.0|This is computer times. People need to find a proper word to use, or find a definition of a word when they work on a computer. An electronic version of the dictionary that can be used on a desktop or laptop computer will be very useful. It is good that this dictionary comes with an electronic version for PDA and Smartphones. However, most people have a desktop computer, and only some people have a PDA or Smartphones. I would rate this dictionary 5 stars if an electronic version for desktop or laptop computer is available.
B000002L68|5.0|THIS IS, BY FAR, THE BEST PRINCE ALBUM EVER.  I BOUGHT ON LP WHEN I WAS 15 WITH THE POSTER INSERT AND HAVE SINCE BOUGHT IT ON CASSETTE AND CD.  IF YOU LIKE PRINCE AT ALL, THEN THIS IS A MUST HAVE.  THE REVOLUTION IS THE BEST BAND HE EVER HAD.  WE ALL KNOW \\"WHEN DOVES CRY\\" WAS AN INSTANT CLASSIC.  BUT MY FAVORITE IS THE LONG \\"PURPLE RAIN\\".  ALSO VERY NOTEWORTHY IS \\"THE BEAUTIFUL ONES\\", \\"I WOULD DIE 4 U\\" AND \\"BABY, I'M A STAR\\".  THIS ALSO RANKS AS ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDTRACKS OF ALL TIME.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|I bought this DVD for my boyfriend who armwrestles professionally (before I dated him I didn't know there was such a thing). Anyway, I got it for him for his birthday. He kept dropping subtle hints about wanting the movie on DVD because his VHS version had seen better days. Upon receiving his gift, you would have thought I had given him the world. He bragged about his gift to all his friends and fellow armwrestling acquaintances. He said the quality of this DVD is excellent. The only complaint he had was that there were not any special features other than the original movie trailer.
B00005MP58|5.0|beautifully enhanced, my favorite old English novel that I had video taped from an old Masterpiece Theater TV show. The video had become corrupted and damaged, breaking my heart. This was the original version on DVD and was just as good as I remembered it. I couldn't believe I could find not just a copy but an excellent copy in a more stable medium. Thank you, Thank you, Amazon.com
B000021Y7X|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Talking Heads live in Australia back in January 1984 at a 3 day outdoor concert performing the whole show that is in this film.  It came towards the end of a long day and night but well worth it.  It remains one of my all-time top 5 concert experiences (if not number 1) and the film does it complete justice.  Funny that I could've sworn I saw the movie before I saw them perform it live but if it was filmed in December '83 it must've been the other way around.  Can't wait to get my own copy of this and relive a lot of memories
076790592X|4.0|This is a good book, it can teach you many different lessons about life.  As Mitch and Morrie grew older and apart, Mitch forgot about Morrie.  Morrie always remembered Mitch as the bright young college student that he loved.  Once he is diagnosed with ALS he life starts to change.  Morrie loved to go dancing and ALS attacks your muscles making you have limtited mobility.  When Mitch sees his college professor on T.V. he calls him and says he wants to come see him.  Over the course of their visits Morrie teaches him lessons about his life.  How it is ok to ask for help when you can no longer help yourself.  To give up the man image of wanting to die after you can no longer help yourself.  Finally not to be scared of death but to prepare for it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was hands down the single best TV show of this decade thus far.  The movie version \\"Serenity\\" was good, but the TV show is much better.  Hopefully, the rumors of a new season of Firefly being produced for distribution on DVD turn out to be true. <br /> <br />Firefly displayed great humor, well written dialog and there was excellent chemistry among the crew.  The scenes  around the dinner table were truly wonderful.  <br /> <br />Firefly was conceived as a \\"space western.\\"  It does invoke the concept of space as the final frontier as well as the original \\"Star Trek\\" and Firefly was far superior to any of the latter Star Trek series.   <br /> <br />Firefly is a great science fiction show full of that sense of wonder for which that you read/watch SF in the first place.
B000AA305M|3.0|It wasnt all that bad, but it took a few listens to start to like it. It has more whining than White Ladder, and I dont like the begining tracks all that much. If you do own White Ladder and are into David Gray, this is a good choice. It picks up a few songs in, and looking up the lyrics helped.
B000023X9W|5.0|Well, I just listened to Prairie Wind again, another great album which reminds me of Silver and Gold, and I cant say enough about how this great man has helped to guide me and help me find insight into my own life through his heartfealt albums.  There are different sides to Neil Young, some best appreciate his hard rock anthems (This Note's For You, Southern Pacific, Like a Hurricane) and some the solopsistic and introveted works, (such as Campaigner, Last trip to Tulsa and Deep Forbidden Lake).  But Neil can surprise us with works that can go either way, like a candle lit at both ends, like his acoustic and electric versions of \\"The Losing End\\".  This album is filled with songs like that, which would be equally at home in either genre.  Many reviewers agree that \\"Distant Camera\\" is one of the most beautiful songs on the album, a sort of Coda to \\"Old Man\\" with a familiar acousitic guitar riff as it's signature.  But the album is a total work that bounds from \\"feel good\\" type anthems celebrating days with the Buffalo Springfield into the maturity of Neil Young as the seasoned artist and father:  \\"Without Rings\\", a song for his son Ben, always brings me to tears, and acheives what he tried to do so hard in attempts like \\"Transformer Man\\".  I truly wish that Neil Young would command the respect of his contemporaries; if there is a postumous Travelling Wilburys\\" being composed in another dimension with folks like Jerry Garcia added to the Harrison/Orbison mix, they are truly envious and anxious for Neil to join in (but we would rather have him here as long as we can keep him with us).
0694003611|5.0|Good Night Moon is a simple bedtime book that is perfect for sharing with little ones ages six months to three years.  It begins by naming various items found in a little bunny's \\"Great Green Room,\\" and then goes on to say good night to each one of them.<br /><br />Reading Good Night Moon nightly is not only a lovely bedtime ritual, but also a great way to begin building a vocabulary for a little one.  My children also enjoyed looking for the little white mouse in the illustrations.  Trying to remember where the mouse was on each page was a great memory booster.  I believe that this classic bedtime book should be on the bookshelf of every nursery.
B0002PUH2Y|5.0|I saw Bebe perform over the summer, and that was the first time I had ever heard of her. But she is incredible. She was running around and dancing and having a great time and really worked the crowd. She has a great voice and her songs rock - it doesn't matter if you understand Spanish or not, because as she says, Music is universal. I love the songs, they're great to move to and she sings with so much passion that you get the message. I effing love Bebe!
B00005JKGK|5.0|Four Chinese women transplanted in the U.S.A. brag about their daughters accomplishments (real or fabricated) whenever they come together. They call these informal social gatherings the 'Joy Luck Club', a name meant to express their parental hopes and dreams for their daughter's future.<br /><br />While most of their conversations through the years are based on one-upmanship, eventually their false personas fall away and the real emotional traumas and hardships of their lives float to the surface. As we learn more about the past of these four women and the lives they led in China the better we come to understand the emotional, cultural dynamics between mother and daughter and how their relationships have adversely affected the lives of their offspring.<br /><br />There is much sadness in this film, but there is also hope and redemption offered for a brighter future. The ending is certain to bring tears to your eyes. Much more than just a chic flick. Very Highly Recommended!
B000B19BCG|3.0|Though this is not a bad album by any means, it greatly lacks the magic on their previous release, \\"Life On Other Planets\\". This album is \\"ho-hum\\", from the packaging down to the songs themselves. There's just not enough energy on \\"Road to Rouen\\" to get excited over. The things that you love about previous Supergrass albums, the vocal harmonies, lush arrangements and the driving melodies, just aren't found on Road. To their defense, Life was such a great album (the best that year) it would have been next to impossible to top. Buy Road used or burn it from a friend. It just isn't worth the full price.
0142000655|5.0|It is the rare book that hums like a sweet concert of history, drama and soaring wisdom. \\"East of Eden\\" does that and more. Its tale unfolds in measures that tease with insinuation and deeply satisfy with masterful, gorgeous prose that is both precise and soul-warming. And it is utterly, inescapably readable. There is not one passage that wavers from hard, piercing storytelling into whimsy or tangent. The novel's dialogue is sparse, and largely unremarkable, with one exception. If you've read it, you know who I'm talking about. If you haven't, you'll want to find out.
B000055Y0X|3.0|Dr. Strangelove was a pretty good movie I thought. It was what I had expected from an old black and white comedy. An average 15 year old wouldn't get most of the jokes. I understood some jokes that some others may not get but that doesn't mean they were all funny to me. There were funny parts, there were dull slow parts. A lot of jokes had to be explained which for the most part killed the humor. I watched this in English class so as far as school movies go this was one of the best. You need a certain kind of satirical humor which I think I understand pretty well for some one my age. So I would say not great, not bad, pretty good.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I had heard this album on a regular basis almost every week and it really grew on me.  So when my friend moved to Colorado, I was left without the music (and the friend).  It is such a good album.  It feels very real, raw, emotional and I'm still discovering little parts that I like very much.  This is an album you can listen all the way through and enjoy every minute.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|very different from the 2 previous albums of BRMC, but even better of them. A change in sound and style;they abandoned that 'Jesus and Mary chain taste' for a dirty old blues-country sound, full of recalls of the past
B000002TQB|4.0|I've owned this album for as many years as it's been available, and I've never gone very long without playing it.  It's as densely British as The Streets or early Billy Bragg, but infinitely more accessible.  It's fun and rowdy, electronic and rockin'.  Its moods range from the rioutously androgynous and danceable \\"Girls & Boys,\\" to the punky \\"Bank Holiday,\\" to the trancey \\"Far Out\\" (which has lyrics consisting only of stars and features of outer space), to the rapid fire \\"Trouble In The Message Centre\\" and the despairing \\"This Is A Low.\\"  Throw in a few short, listing organ instrumentals, lots of the thickest of British accents, and great, cheeky lyrics, and you have the weird and drunken ride of an album that is \\"Parklife.\\"<br /><br />My wife hates it--says it sounds \\"too 1980s\\"--but I love it.  I think it's among Blur's very best.
B00005JO0J|5.0|From the funk-bluegrass music during the first landing of Serenity through the futuristic-yet-19th-century speech of the worlds of the Alliance and their outcasts, this movie is the coolest quasi-sci fi flick I've seen in many moons.<br /><br />And, oh, the humanity.<br /><br />The last several movies I've gone to I haven't cared about anyone, even the so-called \\"good guys.\\"  In this movie, you have an encapuslation of all that's precious about people in the crew of Serenity: A flawed yet earnest captain, a right hand man who's barely under control, a darling-yet-tough ship's engineer who flits and fights, and a host of associated off-ship cohorts who form a saving network for our crew.  And they really are \\"our\\" crew, almost from the start.<br /><br />And the \\"bad guy\\" in this film is equally complex and wonderful.  Like Eric Hoffer's \\"true believer,\\" he's relentless and passionate in his pursuit of Serenity and her cargo.  But he's no cardboard cutout.<br /><br />Obviously, I loved this film and don't want to give away too much.  The ending talk between the two shipmates in the flight chairs about what keeps the ship together was the icing on the cake.<br /><br />I've seen this film twice in a week, and I hardly ever do that.
0262731541|4.0|Prof. Wilson is well-respected in the engineering community, and this book is the best we have on the topic.  Alas, even though Americans can land a man on the moon, we don't currently have a comprehensive, accurate computer simulation of the bicycle, rider, terrain, and atmospheric condition suitable for design optimization.  Bicycle science is still very empirical!  Contrast this with automotive engineering, aerospace engineering, watercraft engineering, and rail travel engineering (although to be fair, there is no Defense Department money for bicycle advancements).  As a systems and mechanical engineer in industry (but not the bicycle industry) I've written numerous computer simulations for all kinds of machines and processes; my engineering doctoral dissertation was on the detailed computer simulation of a modified gas turbine engine (published as Theory and Design of the New Rational Combustion Engine)--so it rather amazes me that we don't have something comparable for bicycle design.  Prof. Wilson candidly states on p. 365 that \\"...expert application of engineering methods has played very little part in bicycle design.\\" and on p. 282 contributing author Papadopoulos states that \\"...most [dynamic] analyses are incorrect, either because of faulty methods or because of errors in algebra\\" (and this at a time when theoretical physicists are promolgating theories to the thirteenth decimal place).<br /><br />The authors present some of the simple equations, but don't number them, and there are some symbol mistakes (e.g., on p. 242 an equation is missing a couple of divisor signs and lacks a negative sign at the beginning).  Symbols are defined at the end of the book, rather than at the beginning or end of each chapter.  For most scientists and engineers, there are far too many words, and far too few equations in this book (but that's more the fault of the low level of development of this discipline, 120 years after the Starley safety bicycles were introduced).<br /><br />End-of-chapter references and notes are excellent, as are the diagrams and figures (except that Fig. 11.30 is apparently mis-labeled).  There is a history timeline at the back of the book, but it stops at 1934. Useful Web-site addresses are given.  However, no comparative design information is given for tire tread, frame structure, handlebar type, and suspension layout.  What's better:  a seat suspension post or rear wheel suspension?--Not answered.  Saddle height is discussed, but not reach to the handlebars.  The chapter on Materials and Stresses discusses only unsprung bicycles.  Wilson states correctly (on p. 381) that \\"triangulation\\" prevents frame collapse (unlike quadrilateral designs) and many new mountain bikes feature such a design (just look at Specialized's current catalog).<br /><br />Highlights of the book include the discussion of many alternative styles of human-powered vehicles, including recumbent bikes (Wilson's preferred design), aircraft, and watercraft.  I especially like the idea of rail bicycles--this has got to be the most efficient form of transportation (with the possible exception of the Lewis-Adkins Regenerative Spiral-Drive Train, which is not discussed).<br /><br />All-in-all this book is a good read, but if you're a bicycle engineer, the book won't help you much.  A Google search on the Web finds only one link for \\"Bicycle Computer Simulation\\"--to a Taiwanese paper \\"The Construction of a Bicycle Computer Simulation Model for Riding Comfort\\"--let's hope that the fourth edition of Bicycling Science will be much more comprehensive and much more computer-oriented./> <br />End-of-chapter references and notes are excellent, as are the diagrams and figures (except that Fig. 11.30 is apparently mis-labeled).

B000AU9UYM|3.0|This is a great film and the distributors of the DVD have only half done it justice with their deluxe packaging.  The comic book extras are nice (and a bargain).  The content of the second disc is--I suppose--really interesting.  The problem is the horrible menu for it: baffling, frustrating, and completely opaque as to how it should be used.  This is hard to explain.  But since it will end up selling a ton of units, interested buyers will just have to wait to see what all of the complaining is about.  Myself, I ended up testing the limits of my remote control, until I did something irrevocable with my DVD/VCR settings and ended up being able to play nothing.  Very annoying since I like a lot of electronics users know nothing about things like \\"progressive scanning\\" (the crux of my SNAFU).  I never knew how complex and problematic DVD playing could be until somehow I'd stumbled across this feature and screwed it up, all because I mashed every button on my remote desoerately trying to undo a function I never knew existed.  Let's just say I went out and excitedly bought the deluxe set, brought it home, and spent hours trying to figure out the idiotic menu--at the end of which time I smashed my player with my fists and threw it down the concrete stairs of my apartment building's basement.  I went out and paid for a new player and paid another hundred dollars to have it installed by professionals who know all about the hook-ups.  I'm probably the only one who will have had this extreme a problem with this DVD set, but who knows where the frustration of its usage will lead others?  I ended up spending 250 dollars instead of 30! <br /> <br />Oh well . . .

0375703764|5.0|House of Leaves is a seemingly chaotic mass of intricate plotlines, highly developed characters, and extensive research. This genre-busting book defies explanation. It takes elements of a blockbuster horror movie, a thriller novel, and a tale of romance and blends them seamlessly with the existential journey of multiple characters on multiple levels. <br /> <br />The book follows multiple plotlines. The main character, Johnny Truant, ventures to a neighboring apartment with his friend Lude. The apartment used to belong to an old blind (presumably French) man who had recently died. While examining the place, Johnny discovers a jumbled stack of papers written by the old man. Its title, \\"House of Leaves\\".  <br /> <br />The main portion of this book is the events that go on in the House of Leaves. The House of Leaves is the analysis of a fictional movie entitled The Nividson Record. It tells the story of the retiring photojournalist Will Nividson and his family as they move into their new house on Ash Tree Lane. One day, Nividson notices that one of the walls in his house seems longer than usual. When he goes to measure it, he finds that it is in fact larger that it was before. However, when he measures the outside of the house, he finds that it is the same length as normal. The inside of his house is larger than the outside.  <br />Eventually, one night, a new closet appears in the house. When Will opens it, he discovers that it leads off into a dark labyrinth. The Nividson Record chronicles his exploration of this new space. <br /> <br />The book is written from the perspective of the old man and his analysis of the Nividson Record. However, the character Johnny Truant's personal story is also included as various footnotes throughout the novel. Almost every page in the book has some sort of reference or footnote attached to it. Some of the sources are real, others not, but they all play an important role in explaining the novel. There are also many syntactical manipulations to the text. The words in the story often mimic the action that is happening. If the character is confused, the words are scattered for instance. It is quite frequent to find pages with only one or two words on them or others that contain only a list of names. While all of this at first seems meaningless, it is soon discovered that everything in the book has a purpose (such as coded messages in the footnotes). <br /> <br />House of Leaves is an exciting and somewhat challenging read due to its complex structure yet once you get into it, it all makes sense. It is a visionary exploration into the narratory view and is a must read for anyone who loves a wonderful, developed story with many mysteries to discover. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Absolutely Slamming! Songs 1 - 4 blew me away and song 5 \\"Precious\\" was a hit for me from the moment I heard it. This has renewed the old dark, mysterious, and techno mode I love. If there ever was a true essence of Depeche Mode this CD encapsulates it all. Take it from me their #1 fan, this CD will become your favorite. yes, even better than Violator. Although songs 1-4 grabbed my attention, like all Mode the whole CD is brilliant. I am so happy I have 7th row tickets for their tour this November. The live performance is going to be fantastic!
B000AY3KN0|5.0|One reviewer was dismayed that this Collector's Edition Kong has more material than the one in the box set. It's true, but the disks are the same. You just get a nice box and extra printed matter with this big daddy.  The price is right, so buy them both. It's going to kill you to have an extra copy of the two disk Kong sitting around your house?  You can always give it away.  That's probably what I'll end up doing.  The important thing is you'll have the Collector's Kong and two other movies.  Of course, you COULD buy Mighty Joe and Son of Kong on single disks, but you'll end up paying more for them than you would for the full box set.  Buying this Collector's Kong is a no-brainer and ponying up for the box set should be one, too.

B000002BFZ|5.0|While this is certainly one of the least popular albums judging by sales it far exceeds this listener's desires in an album. While one must also note that it does take some different directions than pearl jam has taken in the past it also ends up being the most rewarding listen in the band's catalog. <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"Sometimes\\", not your usual first song rocker but it has great lyrics and nice music and end's with one of the the weakest songs on the album \\"Around The Bend\\". While not a particularly bad song it just doesn't do it for me.  <br /> <br />\\"In My Tree\\" may be the best song the band has ever recorded. The music and vocals just soar...a masterpiece.  \\"Present Tense\\" is another keeper. Just great lyrics and subtle but still powerful music.  <br /> <br />Overall I would reccomend this album to anyone. Definitely my favorite pearl jam album and one of the best disc's I own.

I mean, it is a typical soap opera, and it has comedy, what more could one accually ask for??? This show does not really disgrace housewives or anything, but it is used purely for pleasure. I am 17 years old, but all of the housewives are HOTT. They are hotter then some girls at school. This is a definate buy for anyone.

B000A6T1HC|5.0|Mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli's periodic focus on Baroque repertoire has resulted in some stunning recordings, in particular, her lovelorn Almirena in Christopher Hogwood's 2000 production of Handel's \\"Rinaldo\\" opposite countertenor David Daniels. However, I don't think I have appreciated the full range of her vocal delivery, as well as her lustrous tone and flawless technique, more than I have with this disc of rarefied early music. Intriguingly, it explores music written in Rome between 1703 and 1710 during a papal ban on local opera performances. With great fluidity, Bartoli sings arias written for the castrati not only by the reigning composer of the day, Handel, but also Alessandro Scarlatti and Antonio Caldara, as women had been banished from the stage more than a century earlier.<br /><br />Her fiery delivery is on full display in the opening track, Scarlatti's wildly pyrotechnical \\"All'arme si accesi guerrieri,\\" which Bartoli tears through with astounding speed and force. Right afterward, in direct contrast, there is Scarlatti's gentle \\"Mentre io godo in dolce oblio\\" from \\"Il Giardino di Rose,\\" in which the singer sweetly rests among the flowers along the riverbank, as the orchestra simulates a gentle breeze. Handel is well represented with his \\"Un pensiero nemico di pace\\" from \\"Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno\\", where Bartoli shows off with impressive dexterity a series of virtuoso runs. As a precursor to the more familiar \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" from \\"Rinaldo\\", his \\"Lascia la spina, cogli la rosa\\" from the same work has a similar opening refrain, which leads to an aria full of noble simplicity and tonal purity. You will also hear Bertarido's familiar aria of triumph, \\"Vivi, tiranno\\" from \\"Rodelinda\\", complete with the same trumpet accompaniment, on Handel's \\"Come nembo che fugge col vento\\". But this hardly reflects retread as it does Handel's mastery of the musical idiom.<br /><br />As the least familiar of the trio, Caldara serves up arguably her most poignantly rendered performances here peaking with his \\"Si piangete pupille dolente (Aria di Santa Francesca)\\" where Bartoli fully demonstrates her inimitable ability to convey pathos via slow, sonorous tones. His \\"Vanne pentitia a piangere (Aria di Santa Eugenia)\\" from \\"Il Trionfo dell'Innocenza\\" provides a similarly shimmering showcase for Bartoli, and her authoritative trilling impressively takes over his \\"Sparga il senso lascivo veleno (Aria di Flavia)\\". But leave it to Handel to have the last word, as his music provides the closing track, a lovely performance of \\"Notte funesta...Ferma l'ali\\". It is at once mournful and defiant, as befitting Mary Magdalene's recitative and aria from \\"La Resurrezione\\".<br /><br />Renowned early music director Marc Minkowski raises his baton expertly to lead Les Musiciens du Louvre through an equally thrilling performance. The essay in the accompanying booklet that compares post-WWII Italy with 18th-century opera and oratorios is intriguing in showing the power of the Catholic Church to enforce censorship of art forms they deemed unsuitable. This explains Bartoli's diva-esque pose in the fountain on the cover, as she mimics the monumentally zaftig Anita Ekberg cavorting in the Trevi in Federico Fellini's classic \\"La Dolce Vita\\". It also explains how this music has relevance for modern audiences hungering for untapped early music. As she has proven again, Bartoli is most definitively the ideal muse with her ardently soaring voice hovering over the seamless melodies of the three masters.red performances here peaking with his \\"Si piangete pupille dolente (Aria di Santa Francesca)\\" where Bartoli fully demonstrates her inimitable ability to convey pathos via slow, sonorous tones.

0156027321|5.0|\\"I'll be honest about it. It is not atheists who get stuck in my craw, but agnostics. Doubt is useful for a while. We must pass through the garden of Gethsemane. If Christ played with doubt, so must we. If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, \\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\\" then surely we are also permitted to doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.\\" <br /> <br />Piscine Patel, Pi for short, is a religious boy, but the piety he expresses is one that pleases neither his family nor his spiritual leaders. Pi finds beauty in all traditions that see the world as awe inspiring and filled with meaning. He meshes his native Hinduism with Christianity and Islam, considering himself a follower of all three faiths, much to the chagrin of the Imam and priest, each of whom thinks he has converted a Hindu, or his Hindu guide, viewing Pi's syncretism as beyond even Hinduism's collection of various gods. Pi's parents and brother, culturally Hindu but practically non-religious, see his religiosity as a silly side hobby for a sixteen year old boy. <br /> <br />Is our world filled with beauty, wonder, and the transcendent, or is it one of cold, logical, calculation? If we go by the evidence, we remain static in doubt. Like Christ in Gethsemane, doubt is okay as a stage, but we must leap past the evidence and make a choice. Which story would you rather believe? The reader will explore this question with the sad turn of events in the Life of Pi. <br /> <br />Pi's father runs a zoo. He decides to move the family from India to Canada. On the ride across the ocean, with the animals on board, the boat sinks. One lifeboat makes it, and surviving is Pi, with a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger, Richard Parker. It becomes a game of survival, as our animal friends are dispatched one by one, until only Pi and Richard Parker remain. Can our deepest fears be transformed into our greatest loves? Can we see our lives as part of a greater tale? We all go through doubt. How we come to decide which story to believe at the conclusion of Pi's epic journey, I think, is a window into which direction we go on the question of the transcendent after we each pass through our own personal garden of Gethsemane.

B00005A3KS|3.0|The other day I decided to pop in my DVD copy of Point Break, the movie that I believe was Keanu Reeves's coming out party as the worst actor of our generation. True, more people may know him from the two Bill & Ted movies, and now from the Matrix, but Point Break was his real breakout role. In Bill & Ted, Keanu plays an idiot; i.e. he plays himself. The real comedy comes when he tries to act in serious roles, beginning with his star turn opposite Patrick Swayze in Point Break. <br /> <br />There is no getting past the hilarity in a preposterous movie that tries to take itself seriously. Keanu Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a Midwestern boy two years removed from leading his college football team to the Rose Bowl as the star quarterback. He has just set foot in Los Angeles to begin a career in the FBI unit that investigates bank robberies. He is assigned to partner with 20 year veteran Angelo Pappas, who is annoyed to be \\"babysitting some quarterback punk.\\" Pappas is played by the immortal Gary Busey. <br /> <br />When you cast Keanu and Gary Busey, you already know that the movie is going to be ridiculous. Gary Busey is known as That Guy who was the bad guy in Under Siege, the crazy army guy in Black Sheep, the aging Cubs pitcher who dates Henry Roengarter's mom in Rookie of the Year, and also formerly known as That Guy who looks like Nick Nolte, although now I would say he is more famous and more entertaining than Nolte. Busey has gone from \\"That Guy\\" status to \\"Caricature of Himself\\" status, and to completely do him justice, he would need his own column. <br /> <br />Before moving on, we need some Gary Busey quotes from this movie: <br /> <br />\\"When they run they dump the vehicle and they vanish... like a virgin on prom night. I mean they vanish, swishh...\\" <br /> <br />\\"Listen you snot-nose little [poop], I was takin' shrapnel in Khe Sanh when you were crappin' in your hands and rubbin' it on your face.\\" <br /> <br />\\"22 years. Man, L.A. has changed a lot duringthat time. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Let me tell you something, Harp. I was in this bureau while you were still popping zits on your funny face and [blank] off to the lingerie section of the Sears catalog.\\" <br /> <br />\\"I'm so hungry I could eat the [butt] end out of a dead rhino, I should have had you get me three of these things!\\" <br /> <br />Anyways, there is a group of bank robbers called the ex-presidents. Gary Busey thinks that they are surfers, since they only rob during the summer months, and one of the guys mooned the security camera during their last robbery, and he has a surfers tan. So, Keanu goes undercover and heads for the beach, to learn to surf and try to get in with the surfer dudes, with the hope of finding the bank robber gang. Of course, there is a girl (That Girl who plays the younger sister in A League of Their Own) who teaches Keanu how to surf, but more importantly, become the token romantic interest who of course has a tie-in to the bad guys. <br /> <br />Or, are they bad guys? We meet a band of surfers, with the leader a dude named Bodhi, played by Mr. Dirty Dancing himself, Patrick Swayze, with a little facial stubble and blond curls. There is the requisite male bonding between Keanu and Bodhi, mystical bull about being one with the waves, and the movie forgets that it is starring Keanu Reeves, and tries to be deep with Bodhi (after we find out-as if we didn't know-that he and his buddies are the Ex-Presidents) giving a speech about how corporate America is the real bad guy, and they are the ones who are really living life by being rebels, searching out the next wave, and blah blah blah. <br /> <br />It won't be giving anything away to say that Bodhi and his boys find out that Keanu is an undercover cop, so they take him along for sky-diving (cue cheap symbolism) and let him join in with the Ex-Presidents on their next robbery; a rush Keanu won't pass on since Bodhi has the girlfriend under captive somewhere else. Things go bad during the robbery, and Bodhi and his two surviving bodacious dudes are on the run, with Keanu and Gary Busey on the trail. Busey (the real star, in my opinion, not only of this movie, but of every movie he graces his over caffeinated [over-coked?] self in) gets killed as Keanu won't allow him to shoot Bodhi, since he knows Bodhi must be kept free until the girlfriend is found. We have another skydiving scene, this time with Keanu not using the brain he doesn't have and jumping out of the plane without a parachute and catching onto Bodhi. We have reached our climatic moment-will Keanu, holding onto Bodhi, drop his gun and pull the parachute string at the last minute? A good movie might have allowed us to doubt what would happen. <br /> <br />Bodhi goes on his way, and releases the girl to Keanu. The movie can't end here, though. We have to jump ahead 6 months to an approaching tsunami in Australia. Bodhi is ready to ride the wave of the century, and Keanu arrives on the scene to arrest him. Keanu cements his place as the worst actor of our generation with lines such as \\"You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died. You gotta go down\\" and THE line that shows Keanu's (limited) acting rang and (sadly) his jump into stardom, \\"I'm an EFF BEE EYE agent!\\" Will Keanu arrest Bodhi and bring him in, or let him have his one shot riding the wave of the century? Once again, this movie leaves no doubt. <br /> <br />Point Break was terrible, yet very entertaining. Like the ghettho-ized Bad News Bears rip-off Hardball, and the so bad and clichd its unintentionally funny The Replacements, Keanu Reeves always manages to make movie-going quite an experience. I'd like to say to you, Keanu, and I think I speak for many, vaya con dios, bro. <br /> <br />San Dimas football rules!!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|No matter what new, great music I discover, I find myself immediately back to Sufjan.  This album, as well as \\"Michigan\\", are among the best albums I've truly ever heard, and after maybe 100 listens, I still come back to them almost nightly.  This man is a mad, beautiful genius.  The world of music lovers should rejoice that he came along.
B000007S5B|5.0|Having read a few reviews on this website it is apparent that a lot of people consider this one of the best Doors albums. It's good; don't get me wrong but it doesn't hold up to such albums as their debut, L. A. Woman, Morrison Hotel, and Strange Days. <br />Its better than The Soft Parade and every song on the album is good, but it lacks the energy that the other albums featured. Here's the track list; <br />1. Hello, I Love You-5/5-I love this song. Catchy and the lyrics are great. <br />2. Love Street-5/5-This song is interesting. Morrison sings it in a very sensual voice.  <br />3. Not to Touch the Earth-5/5-This is one of my favorites. The song sounds haunting; The keyboards are very psychedelic and cool. The song is compiled from excerpts from \\"The Celebration of the Lizard\\" a poem by Morrison. <br />4. Summer's Almost Gone-4/5-OK song. Not the best. <br />5. Wintertime Love-4/5-It's really short. It's a pretty good song, but not the best. <br />6. The Unknown Soldier-5/5-This song took a while to grow on me; but it's one of their best. The lyrics are amazing. <br />7. Spanish Caravan-5/5-Guitar & Keyboards are amazing in this song. <br />8. My Wild Love-5/5-Don't know what it is about this song, but it's great. The indian chanting in the background (I guess that's what it is) is a great touch. <br />9. We Could Be So Good Together-4/5-(No Comment) <br />10. Yes, The River Knows-5/5-I love the lyrics in this one. The song is good as well though. <br />11. Five to One-5/5-\\"No one here gets out alive.\\" <br />A-

B000002KDG|5.0|But first use it to get this INCREDIBLE offering from NEIL YOUNG. Thats right kids, I'm talking about that guy that your parents like, WHAT? He's crazy, and this is one of his greatest. All recorded live, but not meant to sound that way. You won't even notice, it sounds GREAT, (I always used to wonder how he pulled this off- he recorded a lot of stuff this way.)<br /><br />This album was recorded in 1979 just when the punk scene was getting huge. Neil Youngs central theme on this album HEY HEY MY MY or MY MY HEY HEY whichever way you choose it , is about rock and roll. The King may be dead, but he is not forgotten... enter punk rocker Johnny Rotten. Elvis just died, and youth was now rocking to The Sex Pistols. These lyrics confuse some people.<br /><br />Neil Youngs coolest acoustic set is side one. THRASHER, RIDE MY LLAMA, and POCAHONTAS rule. SAIL AWAY almost as much. Plus MY MY HEY HEY the acoustic version of RUST.<br /><br />Neil Youngs coolest electric set can be found on side two- ripping with grungy intensity are these powerchord driven hard rockers- POWDERFINGER, WELFARE MOTHERS, and SEDAN DELIVERY plus HEY HEY MY MY the blood thirsty version of RUST.<br /><br />All together you get a NEIL YOUNG masterpeice, that may be over your parents heads (unless they are cool.) My second favorite Neil Young album only to ZUMA.<br /><br />Trust me kids, this one ROCKSSSS, I wouldn't steer you wrong. Even though I like a lot of Neil Young (HARVEST, AFTER THE GOLD RUSH, EVERYBODY KNOWS....) all five star albums as well, this is your transitional peice. Heavy Kettle. Folk Metal.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I bought Batman,and Batman Returns today. They are both classics, and Returns holds a special place in my heart cause i saw it in theaters when it came out. I was only 7. So thats probably my favorite. Forever was ok. I did enjoy Tommy Lee Jones, and Jim Carrey, as Two-Face, and The Riddler respectively, but Michael Keaton is the best Batman of all time! Not Val Kilmer, and certainly not George Clooney. But the 5 stars are for the first two alone. I bought only the first two,not the box set, but the first two alone warrant the 5 star rating I think. Michael Keaton the best!

B000B2YQX4|3.0|I agree that Playing The Angel is no VIOLATOR!  I do not think that you can not expect that from them anymore. Those days are OVER!  What I would like to expect is Dave SINGING....not screaming.  I wish the cd would have kept up with Precious.  Not that it has to be upbeat, but the singing and music is excellent on that track and the rest is no match.  It is just....ok. Dave's voice sounds so much better when he sings rather than screams.  I also think that the songs sung by Martin Gore are horrible on this cd.  I normally like Martin's singing with DM.  The Martin tracks were SUB PAR!  To me, Depeche is NOT SUB PAR.  This was more of a Dave Gahan follow up than a Depeche Mode cd.  I have loved Depeche since I first heard \\"Shake the Disease\\" when that came out.  I then went back and bought the earlier and have been a fan ever since.  They are my favorite band and even with the 3 star rating........I still love them.  Don't love the cd.....but it will have to take some listening.  Bring back the days when you could just put on a Depeche cd and love it from beginning to end.  I actually like Exciter more than PLaying the Angel.  Exciter took some getting used to as well.  Ultra I agree is in there too with taking some getting used to.
B00000JFV9|5.0|Curtis Mayfield was already something of a well-known figure in the Soul and Rhythm & Blues scene before he made this soundtrack for the 1972 blaxploitation film of the same name. His work as leader of \\"The Impressions\\" helped greatly, and more importantly, his incredible solo artist debut album \\"Curtis\\" marked him out as a significant talent, with a warm and Passionate vocal talent, coupled with some of the smoothest and exuberant upbeat funk& Psychedelic soul, thanks to his proficiency with the guitar   (both acoustic & Electric).    But in agreeing to soundtrack the Soundtrack for the movie \\"Superfly\\", Curtis was far too shrewd to simply just deliver a wonderfully musical soundtrack, and what he did was to, actually take the opportunity to produce a soundtrack with a underlying message.  One that highlights the dangers of 'Running the Streets' and a strong 'Anti-Drugs Message', and although Curtis is clever enough to match the music and lyrics closely enough to the line of the film, and make the majority of songs readily identifiable with various key scenes of the film.  So whether its the surging powerful horns arrangements that highlight \\"Little Child Running' Wild\\", with it's cautionary message of \\"Little Child Runnin' Wild, Watch a while, You see he never smiles, Broken home, Father gone, Mama tired...So he's all alone\\", over dramatic stinging brass, and Curtis' soothing vocal tone, moralising the depressing tale. \\"Pusherman\\" seemingly takes the perspective of a drug dealer, and details the false friendship, a dealer initiates in order to sell his drugs, the lyric \\"I'm your Doctor When in need, Want some coke?, Have some weed!!??, You know me, I'm your friend, Thick and thin\\", over the sparse sounding almost metallic drum rhythm, and a frantic, warbling trombone that cuts into the track and emphasises the decidedly seedy/moody and gritty nature of the track.    \\"Freddies Dead\\" is a pivotal track in the narrative of the album, as it retells the tale of a junkie/pusher that gets caught up in the lifestyle and becomes a causality because of it, and peoples indifference to his fatal plight, reflects peoples attitudes to junkies \\"Everybody's misused him, ripped him up and abused him, Another junkie plan, pushin' dope for the man., A freddies on the corner now, If you wanna be a junkie wow...Remember freddies dead!!\\", over the slow funk guitar heavy groove, mixed with swaggering trumpets and plaintive strings for a track drenched in psychedelic funk, and remains arguably one of the emotionally piercing tracks on the album.  \\"Junkie Chase\\" is a brief instrumental that has a urgent intensity, with speedy funk guitars, and dramatic brass sections, with sharp trumpet arrangements all working together the convey the speed of a chase scene via an instrumental funk workout, admittedly I wished this instrumental was several minutes longer.  \\"No Thing on Me (Cocaine Song)\\" pulls no punches in its damning of the powdered substance, citing it changing people mindsets and taking all comers irrespective of class or race, and yet again Curtis' wordplay shines with: \\"There's somethin' kinda funny How The Man take your money,  He's shrewd as he can be, In such a way you'll never see, It's a terrible thing inside, When your natural high has died...The weaker turn to dope, And put all aside their hope\\" are accurate in the way that people fall to the drug, yet Curtis resists the temptation to make this a finger pointing exercise and instead highlights the perils, of those that become consumed by the drug.   And finishing off the album is the superlative \\"Superfly\\" track, with it's Slinky moody deep, dark grooves, trademarked wah-wah guitar, and creates a beautifully 70's style uptown soul, that has a completely lush atmosphere, thanks the impeccable musicianship, of Curtis and his band, and yet the music exudes a confident swagger thanks to Curtis elegant vocal and consice lyrical content: \\"The game he plays he plays for keeps, hustlin' times and ghetto streets, tryin' ta get over, (that's what he tryin' to do, y'all), taking all that he can take, gambling with the odds of fate, tryin' ta get over...woo, superfly!!!\\", is simply fantastic, and I defy anyone to at the very least, to not do a little shuffle, when they play this track at a reasonably loud volume.    Considering that this soundtrack is some 30+ years old, its still remains not only one of Curtis' greatest musical achievements, but also still arguably one of the greatest movie soundtrack albums ever made.  The musical/instrument side of things is simply astounding, and although it clearly references a period in the 70's, its still has a dynamic creativity and vitality that musical, still stands up against virtually anything the funk/Soul genres have to offer.  But the most truly amazing thing is how a social consciousness, crept into the songs and made for powerful climatic stories contained within the songs that at the very least, require listeners to read the lyrics and see how seamlessly intergrated the lyrics run concurrently with the movie, and perfectly reflect pivotal scenes in the film.  I'll end by say that, anyone that is in any way at all interested in Curtis Mayfield's music, simply must own this album, (even if you own a \\"Best of\\"), as this album's narrative simply needs to be heard in it's intended form, and this is a album that far outshines the movie, it accompanied, and (unlike the film, nowdays), is still an absolutely essential purchase.
0385507755|3.0|I heard about this book on Oprah and had to check it out, not knowing at all the subject matter. I was intrigued and couldn't read enough. I am a recovering addict/alcoholic myself and found that I related with him in a lot of areas. At times I too had to cringe and shake off the brash manner in which he writes. I will never feel the same about the dentist! The problem I have is with all the attention this book is getting, he may influence people taking the traditional way of recovering (12 steps) the newly sober, looking for the 'loop hole'. With every page I turned I was waiting for the light to come on...Be careful with this book...not everyone, if anyone can get sober Frey's way.
0440237688|5.0|My mom introduced this book to me when I was younger and it is the only book that to this day, I continue to read.  As an adult, I enjoy children's books, but as a student, reading was one of my least favorite things to do.  THE GIVER is my favorite story.  It kept my interest as a young reader, which was difficult to do.  This story turned me on to reading because of that.  Before this book, I did not realize that reading could actually be entertaining.   <br /> <br />The author is descriptive and pulls the reader into the book with Jonas' story and struggles.  It is about a time when things such as color do not exist.  Everyone is pretty equal, and no one is out of the ordinary.  Once a year everyone comes to a ceremony where each child advances to the next year of life with new responsibilities.  This year Jonas begins training for his life's work.  He is given the role of The Receiver.  Under this title, Jonas receives information from the past from The Giver.   The Giver is the only one with memories from the past, which are the only resource the community has to make decisions hoping to not repeat the mistakes of the past.
0807014265|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I have read the second half of the book twice. Victor Frankl's logotherapy makes perfect sense to me. I have been reading many books lately that talk about finding meaning and purpose in life. This is the book that puts the icing on the cake as far as believing that having a purpose is the link to survival as well as day to day happiness. As Dr. Frankl states \\"Happiness is not something to be pursued\\" it is a byproduct of living a life of meaning and purpose. I would also recommend logo-therapy as the place to start if you are struggling with any type of mental illness or depression. This book is a excellent read and I recommend it highly.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Each of Sigur Ros' last two recordings have contained a track that by itself was worth the entire album: the title track (#9) for Agaetis Byrjun, and the untitled track # 2 on ( ), a beautiful and haunting piece of music that I would literally have paid $500 to own.  <br /> <br />Takk is the best overall album Sigur Ros has put out so far. I wasn't sure about that on the first listen, but after I'd gone through it three or four times I was persuaded. For me the most stunning track is # 7 (Milano), a 10-minute piece that I can't quite find words to describe. (Production note, however: the transition between Milano and the following track seems to have been put in at the wrong place, so if you're burning a CD mix you'll want to cut the track at 10:06 when you save it on your hard drive instead of the existing 10:25, which takes you into the next piece of music.) <br /> <br />I don't consider the album to be more upbeat than Agaetis Byrjun and ( ). In fact taken as a whole I think Takk is the most painfully beautiful of Sigur Ros' productions. All music is best listened to on a good stereo system, but this is particulary true of this album.
B000AL730Y|4.0|I enjoyed this collection of songs much more than some of the other recent ones.  I felt that the mellow tunes were conducive to McCartney's voice and also to easy listening while not actually becoming \\"elevator-type music.\\"  I am pleased that McCartney is still turning out winners and hope to hear much more from him in future.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|One thing that's quite interesting when it comes down to the comic book heroes of old are that regardless of what's in the comic which should be the final be-all end-all of the events surrounding the characters, filmmakers and TV show creators will come in and completely add new twists or reinvent the character. Before we had 4 Batman films, 2 of which from Tim Burton, big on atmosphere and tone but not masterpieces by any means, just really well done Batman films. Then we got the Schumacher ones, with Forever being an interesting mess and Batman and Robin being film school for how NOT to do a movie, let alone a Batman one. So we have a re-imagining by Christopher Nolan, director of Memento and we're better for it. <br /> <br />Previous films already established Bruce Wayne already being Batman with slight reasons why he became Batman, like in the Schumacher ones. Here, Bruce Wayne is a lost soul who's in a asian prison who's freed by a man named Ducard, who offers a path and help. Bruce begins his training to be a fighter for the innocent until the group he's training with are actually wanting to destroy civilization so Bruce takes off to Gotham to clean it up. <br /> <br />And Gotham really needs to get cleaned up. Many of city officials are under the influence of mob boss Falcone, so Bruce has a lot to deal with. This includes a man who's taken over his parent's company; Dr Crane, a psychologist who induces a fear toxin into patients to make them nuts and corruption. So Bruce adopts his famous alter-ego, Batman, and together with a Q-like Wayne Enterprises employee and butler Alfred, Bruce is ready to fight for Gotham. <br /> <br />Since it is a re-imagining, a lot of things are different. First, I don't recall Wayne Manor ever...um, well it's a spoiler but it's bad. Second, Bruce always built his Batman stuff rather than the Q-like Lucius Fox. And of course we have the re-designed Batmobile. Instead of being like a slick lambourghini, this Batmobile actually looks like a superhero's beastly car. Named the Tumbler, it looks like a cross between a lambourghini, a ferrari and a hummer; fast but still very strong looking. And of course the featurette on it on Disc 2 is really awesome. <br /> <br />Of the previous Batman's, Christian Bale is probably the only one that actually nails both halves of the character, maybe less so on one. To me, Michael Keaton had the Batman part down, only not the Bruce Wayne part while both Val Kilmer and George Clooney had the opposite. Christian Bale does have that millionaire-playboy-but-tortured aspect but maybe not his loneliness. His \\"Batman\\" voice is ok but one scene where he questions a police officer seems really forced. As for the rest of the cast there's one weak link: the other half of TomKat, Katie Holmes. First, her character is a bit useless, existing only for a love interest figure. Second, not exactly the greatest range and she's got buggy eyes and that crooked smile thing bugs me. <br /> <br />Only Superman, the first 2 Batman's and the Spiderman films, this one's probably one of the better comic book adaptations. Here's hoping it's inevitable sequels are just as good. BTW, if you're only into the film there's a movie only version out(there's a theatrical trailer, big whoop), then there's the Deluxe Edition featuring all the goodies. Here's hoping they don't double dip this. But for now, get the Deluxe one.
B000002MFE|5.0|There is nothing like this CD if you are a true Clapton fan.  The accoustic remakes are incredible! <br />
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Dave screams again. He literally does so in the first two tracks, until calm comes, starting with track 6. I was not disappointed, not for a second. For I well knew what to expect. It seems that the success of Violator has made Gore return to well-known paths of success to the hearts of listeners. Frankly, I am tired of the theme touched in Personal Jesus, now in John the Revelator. Genesis tried this, too. I see no big difference. Religion is a common thing, Martin said all there was to say in Songs of Faith and Devotion, which was an excellent album. <br />But I also feel that, without Dave singing and guitar chords filling in the space, much of this album would sound Kraftwerk-ish. Very much so.  <br />Fans (\\"multiplied by seven, multiplied by seven again\\" :))) need not read this. They would listen to DM anyway, despite the critics. :)
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I watched them on the PBS station when they were having a fund raiser.  My daughter and I absolutely loved this concert, but could not financially afford to purchase it then. We were told that it could only be purchased from them.  Then we found it on Amazon.com.  Had to have it.  The women's voices are absolutely beautiful and breathtakingly clear and the music is an added bonus.  If you enjoy Celtic music, I strongly encourage you to purchase this CD.  I listen to it a lot through the week and my daughter who is almost 8 yrs goes around singing the songs all the time.
B000AOENJA|5.0|Ever since i found Nellie Mckays stunning double disc debut 'Get away from me' on the dualdisc format, i have been very interested in new releases of this ultimate album experience. Therefore, When i found David Gray's new album on the format i was very pleased and expected a lot. Although the sound is only surround stereo which is less than the 5.1 dolby dig or DTS mix i was hoping for like the dvd audio release of his New Day at midnight album was, i still believe that it is the best way to enjoy his new album especially with the option to have to the lyrics while the album plays. It also has an interesting making of documentary about the album in the church studios he recorded it. I therefore recommend this very much, along with Nellie Mckay's 5.1 surround dualdisc if you can find it still. Well worth it!!! - just hope Dualdisc finds its way over the pond to us brits soon instead of searching for them on the internet!
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet is the first and best of all sci-fi genre movies. Like the books of Jules Verne, this movie was ahead of its time. While some might think the special effects are corny they were the foundation upon which future sci-fi movies would draw. A must see for all sci-fi enthusiasts!
B00005ASHM|5.0|When I was younger, about the time that I was in High School, I was a huge fan of the Beatles and kind of ignored the music of the Beach Boys, classifying them as predictible surf-pop. However, earlier this year I took a chance and bought Brian Wilson's SMiLE and was absolutely blown away at its complexity and feeling. I spread the word around and some friends suggested that if I enjoyed \\"SMiLE\\" I should check out Pet Sounds. I've owned Pet Sounds for about a week and a half now and all I have to say is that it is my favorite album of all time. I've been slapping myself all this time for never recognizing the genious of Brian Wilson's music, which I believe has more lasting power than anything that has been recorded ever since. Brian said that \\"Pet Sounds\\" was a response to \\"Rubber Soul\\" by the Beatles. Brian won.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|why you should buy 'playing the angel':<br /><br />1. 'a pain that i'm used to' -- an INSTANT depeche mode classic. it's a great opener since 'i feel you,' 'barrel of a gun' and 'dream on' (the previous three dm album openers--and 'personal jesus') are essentially composed from the same blueprint. dave's never sounded more confident. he sounds revitalized and rejuvinated--his voice fuller and richer, and good for him..  the squealing intro gives way to classic dm bassline/groove. it sounds like bubbling tar or someone's synthesized nightmare, and it's fabulous.  it's got a huge chorus along the same vein of 'never let me down again.' i got goosebumps listening to it.<br /><br />2. dave's 'suffer well.' i was so surprised by what a truly great song this is. it reminds me a little bit of 'behind the wheel' in its chord structure (but just a bit). the analog synth at the beginning took me back to 1983. it sounds like 'shout' or 'i sometimes wish i was dead.'  here's hoping dave pens more dm songs in the future.<br /><br />3. 'precious.' the album's centerpiece and another instant dm classic. i've heard some say this is one of the weaker tracks on the album. oh, contraire! it's going to hold a top stop in the dm canon.  and considering martin's going through a divorce and this song's about his kids, it's all the more affecting. again, the analogue synths are a nice touch.<br /><br />4.  the production.  ben hillier, he of doves and blur fame, was an absolute coup.  instead of bringing a electronica guru (mark bell, tim simenon), hillier brings a breath of freshness to the album. 'exciter' sounded forced and too urgent. 'playing the angel,' on the other hand, sounds very organic and alive despite the analogue synths--how he did that, i don't know. and one gets the feeling he gave the band some much needed focus while allowing them to remain loose and inspired. i can imagine the record sessions were much more friendly and cooperative than in the past.  while the songs themeselves are vintage dm (brooding, gloomy, driving, etc), the experimental blips and bleeps and knob-twidling add a nice complexity. the songs slowly evolve, sometimes demanding you listen for two or three minutes for the payoff--something dm has always done--always. those naysayers who claim 'angel' has no melody (which i happen to disagree with) miss the point--dm is about mood and atmosphere.<br /><br />5.  it's bloody depeche mode!  my generation (the 30-35 year old group) were practically weened by the band.  any depeche mode release is cause for celebration. 'playing the angel,' hyperbole aside, really is a classic depeche mode album. it reminds of all the reasons you love depeche mode in the first place:  martin visits familiar themes (sin, redemption, god, lust, etc), dave is still one of the great vocalists around, and well, fletch is still fletch.<br /><br />some have complained about the lack of discernable melodies, and while that's occasionally true (macro, for example), the majority of the songs on 'playing the angel' are quite memorable.  others still complain that \\"it's not violator,\\" or \\"it's not music for the masses.\\" of course it's not, you dolts. nor should it be. if you want another violator, go listen to violator. bands evolve. bands change. deal with it. having said that, however, if you're pining away for depeche mode circa 1987-1990, 'playing the angel' is the remedy for the post-violator blues.  a really, really solid and exciting album and a worthy successor to 'violator.' listen to it for what it is, not what it's not.<br /><br />since 2006 marks the 25th anniversary of 'speak and spell,' i anxiously look forward to their induction into the rock and roll hall of fame.  you deserve it, boys.ing, gloomy, driving, etc), the experimental blips and bleeps and knob-twidling add a nice complexity. the songs slowly evolve, sometimes demanding you listen for two or three minutes for the payoff--something dm has always done--always. those naysayers who claim 'angel' has no melody (which i happen to disagree with) miss the point--dm is about mood and atmosphere.      5.  it's bloody depeche mode!  my generation (the 30-35 year old group) were practically weened by the band.  any depeche mode release is cause for celebration.

B00003XACV|5.0|The American Beauty Score is larger than life. Thomas Newman's masterpiece simply kills me with the heart earning everlasting impact of the sound on this score. The Plastic Bag Theme is something that makes my brain wave a million invisible white flags to it's tremendous simple melody. As corny as I might sound, I celebrate most of life's ironic moments by playing this very melody either on my PC or on my mind. American Beauty is my favourite film of all time and it wouldnt have been possible if this magical score was to be left out. The coordination with the story line and the melody is super and quite award winning. This was probably the first score I truly noticed besides Road To Perdition (Another outstanding composition) If you like this try out \\"The Village\\" by James Newton Howard. However if you want something better,keep looking. The music contained is creative and refreshes one's own existance like a blood purification process. I think I have said enough so let's just play \\"dead already\\" and enjoy our charades. [ Pardon my overdramatic self]
B00068IOWM|5.0|The easy way for longtime U2 fans to bash the current cd is to say that they have sold out. All those of you who claim HTDAAB one of the band's worst cd's are obviously blinded by your pathetic ideals of selling out. <br /> <br />If you judge the product as it is, ignoring the fact that they are on Ipod commercials now you will find a complete GEM. The album is a roller coaster of emotions, it can take you to highs as well as bring emphasis on the low moments of life.  <br />\\"Sometimes you can't make it\\" is very criticised by so called \\"old school\\" fans; what you all don't realize is that this is an gift that Bono gave to himself and his father. It comes from so deep in the heart that we as listeners can feel what he is saying. <br /> <br />Sure, the album has a couple misfires but the overall product is outstanding. Just because U2 has \\"sold out\\" doesn't mean a damn thing, and yes I DO believe that the album goes in the same sentence as Achtung Baby, Joshua Tree, War and Boy. <br /> <br />IT IS THAT GOOD! <br /> <br />U2 prove again why they are one of, if not the best band of all time.
B000001EMW|2.0|This was Apocalyptica's first album, and as such was made before they knew what the hell they were doing. The cellos don't blend or mix well together, and there is a distinct lack of bass-range sound, while the higher notes simply sound whiny. Much of this even sounds totally out of tune. Apocalyptica's music after this album was great, but the only thing good about this particular album is the (previous) quality of the material they butcher. This would only be worth buying (or stealing) if it was Apocalyptica's only album, which of course it isn't. This album is crap.
B000A5044C|5.0|As I live in Australia, I had a problem at first, we are region 4 and the DVD being American is region 1. So I could not watch the movie on my home DVD player.  However my son came to the rescue, he can change regions on his laptop. So I had to watch the movie on a small screen, but it was still great.  Such a moving story, and as I am a student studying Japanese it was a good learning tool, not too difficult to understand. I recommend it to any student of Japanese.
B000A6T262|4.0|Paramount has finally released the ultimate Trek movie box!  I've been waiting for this set for about 4 years, having enough willpower to not purchase their laughable \\"half new half old\\" box sets.  I am thrilled to see each film has been remastered and that the TNG films have DTS tracks (BIG plus for me).  It's a shame they didn't bother to produce a new cover for the first film so it would match the others.  I also noticed one other peculiar difference-the cases do not actually have the hinged piece inside as they do on the seperate releases.  The cases in this set have two hubs on the back, in which one disc sits behind the other, offset.  This would logically eliminate the need for the double size case, yet they didn't change that aspect of it.  I suppose it would somehow appear you are getting less content because the cases are smaller.  How interesting..  Also, only a few of the films have paper inserts.  I understand that this set is supposed to be a more economical choice for those who do not have any of the newer CE releases, but one would think that either all the movies would have inserts, or none at all.  There's no rhyme or reason to this, and the set seems to just be slapped together cheaply.  These minor quibbles aside, the set's audio/video quality is excellent over the old releases, and the extras content is well done-not amazing, but good enough!
B00000AD94|5.0|I don't see how this album could be rated 4 stars. From beginning to end, this is one awesome disc. <br /> <br />I haven't heard any other of the Beard's albums (the only other material I've heard from Neal Morse is his voice on an Ayreon album), but this is by far one of my favorite purchases of the year, maybe ever. <br /> <br />The first track is a definitely a highlight of the album. Some of the lyrics are very weird, but the whole song has a generally warm vibe, and is near perfect. <br /> <br />The other highlight is the 23-minute epic, The Water. This is a really amazing song, and is equally as great as other prog epics such as A Change of Seasons by Dream Theater.  <br /> <br />This album is really special. If you're into progressive rock, get this now. You won't be disappointed.
B0006PV5US|5.0|Munch and the Boston Symphony combine the ultimate in orchestra playing with a power and muscularity sometimes missing in these works. This RCA issue is also one of the best transfers of LP to CD, with solid bass and even some bloom from the horn player's instruments.<br />  It's amazing to realize one would have had to spend more for this recorded music when it first came out than we pay today.<br />  The strongest part of this collection is not the Bolero, hopelessly over-hyped on the back cover as the greatest recoding of the music ever made, for indeed the performance fails to follow Ravel's careful markings of both time and accent, and comes off as drum noise with added instruments - completely lacking in any imagination. Rather instead turn to the La Valse, which catches some of the legendary hysteria Munch found in this music - the whole piece is conceived on an enormous scale - more something one might expect from the Stokowski of the early days back with Philadelphia. The playing throughout crackles with lightning strikes of energy - my favorite version!<br />  The Rapsodie Espagnole is the third of three magnificent recordings given this music by RCA - the other two are with Reiner and Martinon leading Chicago. The Boston soloists simply stun - not only do they execute as well as better than their modern peers, but they bring to the music an extra degree of style and individual tone. Much leads the music nearly as well as Reiner, and that's the highest praise.<br />  What most amazes - the extremely well rehearsed Debussy Images - this is some of the best leadership I can remember hearing from Munch. Few conductors, including Boulez, can keep up with this level of detailed intensity - you hold your breath in wonder in the opening selection, Gigues. Condcuting of a very high order!<br />We usually associate Munch with excitement and verve and certainly this music has that in bunches - but here we can hear a true superior conductor at work - Munch often does not receive full credit for his skills. Here they're on full display!<br />  If you enjoy this issue the entire series of reissues of orchestra music by RCA is very good. Especially not to be missed is Reiner's performances of Bartok.s not receive full credit for his skills. Here they're on full display!          If you enjoy this issue the entire series of reissues of orchestra music by RCA is very good. Especially not to be missed is Reiner's performances of Bartok.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Dr. Strangelove, a movie satirizing the ups and downs of the cold war made years ago, but funny now?  Considering you see the everlasting image of Kong riding a nuclear missile which demonstrates the ideal American man with the \\"big\\" missile, I'd say you're in for a treat if you've managed to never see this movie.  Dr. Strangelove satirizes everything from the coldwar itself, to enemies and the immaturity of government officials, to mocking the slogan of our U.S. Air Force.  I liked this movie for its daring attempts to satirize something that has left a mark in our history. <br />The movie is about a certain Burpleson Air Force Base, and its General, Jack D. Ripper (Jack the ripper, get it?).  He is giving orders to his assistant I believe, to go ahead and put in a code to all planes instructing them to attack Russia.  Everybody certainly agrees that it is a mistake or a drill, until they check the code and face the truth, they really have been instructed to attack.  The problem is, Russia has built a huge bomb underneath of the country that will explode when a nuclear missile implodes on it.  I know you're thinking, yea it's in there country it's okay. WRONG! VERY WRONG! This bomb is so strong that it has enough power to cause a gigantic nuclear explosion that would wipe out all of mankind. Every single person in every single country would be wiped out. And yes, this includes Bin Laden, no matter what four foot hole In Irag that he's hiding in!  By now, you'll realize that General Ripper is crazy, \\"A little funny, in the head\\" according to President Muffley.  You'll see evidence supporting this through his actions of cutting all communications to the base.  Then, in comes the Russian Ambassador who, as far as any person with an I.Q. over ten can see, is spying and taking advantage of the situation.  But anyways, after this is a bunch of crap, Kong's memorable John Wayne re-enactment, and so more crap.  In the end, the ambassador sets off the bomb and the world ispretty much over. <br />Might I quickly add that Dr. Strangelove, although seen only a few times, is the man!! Anybody who fights there own arm is certainly a hero in my book!
B0006284JQ|4.0|Actually I want to give 3.5 star, but for bonus, Ok, 4 stars.  Some musics aren't good, but most of all, it's good. I like some of her songs. Is this a really greatest hit from Britney? I don't think so... But, because there's Madonna inside, it's good.   Top five music (for me):  - Me Against The Music - It's Really perfect! A extra point because of Madonna. Point 9.9.  - Overprotected - It's Very good. Extra point for your voice I... need... time...blablabla. I just love it! Point 9.7.  - Lucky - It's like telling a story. Point 9.5.  - Outrageous - I like the part in the minutes 2:00. Point 9.4.  - Boys ( Co-ed Remix) - The Collaboration with Pharrel William is very good. Point 9.4  note: Britney, your picture in the cover didn't look very good, you looked few years older...  :)
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Phenomenal DVD. It's not just that these guys don't play like they used to but that back then they wanted to be able to play the way they can now. If you want to hear Clapton play a Gibson, buy the Scorsese movie. He plays darn near everything in his basement in that one. <br />   Thirty seven years I waited for this. Through the bad years of record company litigation when the records weren't even available for purchase I listened to cassette tapes and spun the vinyl only on special occasions. And after the legal wrangling was settled I stood in line at Tower Westwood at 7:30 in the morning with fifty other faithful just to purchase three copies of each album in the Cream catalog. Why three? Well lawyers will be lawyers and you never know. Why only three of each? Because that was all I could afford at the time.  <br />    There was a dark time in my life when my first waking thought was \\"Maybe THIS will be the day that Cream gets back together\\" and my last thought before sleep was \\"Well, today was not the day; I'll have to wait for tomorrow.\\" May 2, 2005 was the day.
B000AL730O|1.0|I don't know why I keep wasting my money buying McCartney stuff lately.....,   Driving rain, same, Choas & Creation same...    Just not like old wings stuff, nor other McCartney albums.  Where's the old rocker stuff??
B000002A3T|5.0|This, my friends, is what music is all about. Gilmour has given us his absolute best on this disc and I can honestly say that 'The Division Bell' will likely remain my all time favorite cd of all time. It has all the glorious melody, tasteful guitar solos, and Gilmours fitting vocals in spades. You can tell this would be David Gilmours crowning achievement in his life. Dark Side Of the Moon, and The Wall are also great, but somethingf compels me to rate this one just a touch higher for overall listenability. This cd has a magic quality to it that keeps it fresh and exciting (in a relaxed Pink Floyd sort of way!) even after owning it for 10 years! <br /> <br />Here's where they fall in my music scale: <br />1=poor <br />2=hmmmm...they have work to do. <br />3=okay, but not good <br />4=fair <br />5=decent effort <br />6=good <br />7=quite good! <br />8=excellent <br />9=album of the year <br />10=album of the decade! <br />11=Will never be surpassed by anyone EVER! This is where Division Bell rests....and rests...........and will remain. <br /> <br />Every person in this world should own a copy of this. Is that too much to ask for?
B00005JNEI|1.0|A friend of mine said that the purchase of this \\"LYING, DISTORTING OF THE TRUTH, HUNK OF JUNK MOVIE WAS A MISTAKE\\" and after he showed it to me I could agree with him fully and I would never make the mistake of including this trash movie in my collection. <br />To all who read this review I say don't waste your time or money on this {to put it nicely as possible} piece of crud movie!
B00005UEAR|5.0|I consider this in the top 3 of DT's releases! When this first came out I was blown away by how vast and complex this double disc is while never losing the listener within it's complexities and diverseness. The songs have a great melodic hook to them and if you have the time sit down (or lay down) and just listen to both discs in one big swoop. Do this at least once and you'll understand what I'm talking about here. Most of the time however, you'll find yourself listening to either disc 1 or disc 2 more often than the other.     Without any doubt whatsoever, Dream Theater has written some of it's most moving pieces on this release compared to any other. This album is so good I was almost sure Dream theater would announce their retirement after it's release! I really like Their newest cd \\"Octavarium\\" almost as much as this one now however. But still, \\"Six Degrees....\\" is such an amazing effort that can't be missed by anyone claiming to be a fan of metal or progressive music and this will be enjoyed for years to come.
B000001F45|5.0|One of the best albums from the early 70s/late 60s, back when hard rock and progressive rock were together forming an offshoot - along with influences from classical, eastern music (see Led Zeppelin), heavy blues and eclectic jazz (see Judas Priest's first album, \\"Rocka Rolla\\") and a host of other musicforms - to come up with heavy metal.  Uriah Heep isn't really considered metal but 'protometal', but it's close enough to appeal to metal fans as well as fans of the late 60s/early 70s sound, hard rock & progressive rock, and quality eclectic music as well.  This album is distinct mystical heavy rock, and a shining example of its type of music. <br /> <br />   Uriah Heep tends to tread a lot of welcome fantasy-type ground, which is also covered here, but there are other themes here, like the vibe capturing the exhiliration of romance on \\"Sweet Lorraine\\" and the fearful doomy lyrics of \\"Tales\\".  \\"Sunrise\\" is an alltime gem, fitting well into the beloved realm of fantasy-esque lyrics but in this case, for me, resounding even more powerfully with its combination of the 'missing love'/'undying love' themes.  Great intro to the song and tremendous (and influential) musicianship all throughout.  Title track \\"The Magician's Birthday\\" jumps from musical style to musical style within itself - including a part featuring what sounds like a kazoo! - although, regretfully, the coolest guitar parts on the whole album wind up representing the 'evil' part of the tale.  Still exuberantly cool though.  Musicianship and vocals great all through the album, with some of the best quirky-sounding synthesizer sounds ever laid down, doing exactly what a synthesizer generally does Best - not imitating other instruments but creating brand-new, usually bizarre, sounds you don't get off traditional instruments. <br /> <br />  I should note that I noticed in the search engine there are new versions of this with bonus tracks out, which I couldn't review because I haven't heard them.  Most of these bonuses are 'alternate versions' (sometimes 'single edits') of other Heep tracks but you still may wish to hunt down audio samples of the tracks represented on the expanded editions before deciding which version you want to buy.  Now Hopefully, someday there'll be a big grand boxed set collecting All of Heep's rare tracks, but until then.... <br /> <br />Whichever version you end up going with, you can't really go wrong with this.  Great, emotion-spanning and inventive album whose vast influence will, unfortunately, probably never be acknowledged by professional critics but is no less vital for it.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Most of the comments I've read here agree that this is a great movie. I have seen opinion. The coffee shop scene tells everything about this film: 10/10. The human side of the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning De Niro's character (Neil). His personal conflicts are strong as his determination and skills as a gangster. This is the magic of the film and only two fantastic actors like Pacino and De Niro could represent it so totally.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Neil Young has created four decades of music. His first solo record came out in 1969. Now it's 35 years later and we got Prairie Wind. His last few albums have been weird and strange. Young has gone back to the basic for this one. He recorded it in Nashville. It is mostly an acoustic record. The first songs \\"The Painter\\" and \\"No Wonder\\" are excellent. He has created maybe some of his best songs since Harvest (1972). Emmylou Harris sings on a few of these songs. The production is really great. There are a lot of horns and strings on this record. There are a lot of musicians too. I don't want to say that it is just voice and guitar because there is a full band sound on most of the tracks. But this is a more intimate Neil Young record, than a typical Crazy Horse rock record. The song \\"Prairie Wind\\" has some cool guitar picking on it. Young hasn't lost the fire, like some young bands have recently. The melody of \\"Here For You\\" is just lovely. People have told me that the last few Dylan records have been good. I am not so sure if that is true. But some of these songs show that Neil Young is still very gifted in this late period. He has the ear for the music. \\"He Was The King\\" has that raw feeling that is just wonderful. Neil Young may be the greatest gifted songwriter that I know of. This guy is the real deal.
6305263248|5.0|Yes, this movie was great. The chase scenes, the plot, Bobby D's character was excellent. Not to mention the supporting cast. It kept you entertaining throughout thw whole movie. Not many movies have come since that i can remember being so entertaining.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur Ros is one of the most respected international bands today. They haven't really done a bad recording yet. Going to see them play is much like going to church than just seeing a proper rock show. Their fans just sit on the floor and camp out. There is a little dancing. I saw them twice so far and it has been a great experience. I saw them recently in August 2005, and they played a few new songs off this album. There is no new territory being covered here. But on songs like \\"Glosoli\\" there is more a focus on keyboard instruments and toy instruments. For some reason their music always evokes this childhood experience that comes before language. Their builds on elements like repetition and quietness. The songs often build to amazing crescendos, and it feels like the dam is about to burst. It is a very intense visceral experience. The song \\"Hoppipolla\\" begins with a dual pianos playing simple notes, then moves to on interesting rhythmic patterns. New songs like \\"Se Last\\" have interesting vocalizations. Some of the rhythms are played on keyboards. There are some horns at the end, which sound wonderful. Sigur Ros has made an album that is totally accessible, and better than their last one. This is Sigur Ros at their height, using their past success, and creating something more interesting. It is a very modern record.
B000001GBJ|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's..so calming and soothing and beautiful! <br /> <br />Highly recommended for anyone.
1401308201|5.0|From the moment I took the book out of the shipment box and into my hand I felt elation! <br />The weathered and aged look and feel of the book from cover to cover is delicious! The photos and graphics are outstanding! Anything you could possibly want to know about WICKED is in this book. It is absolutely packed with info. It even includes the dialogue and lyrics. <br />A must have for any WICKED fan!  <br />
B00005JOGU|5.0|This movie tells how Truman Capote wrote \\"In Cold Blood\\". It shows the relationship that Capote developed with the killers so that he could get his story. Capote even became very close to one of the killers, and favored him over the other one. He got involved in their case, even getting them lawyers.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Capote perfectly. He deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance. He gets every little detail of Capote's characteristics down to perfection.<br /><br />Another great actor in this is Chris Cooper, who plays the lead investigator. He develops a friendship with Capote and lets him interview the killers.<br /><br />Catherine Keener deserves a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role as Nelle Harper Lee, who is Capote's long time friend. She assists him in his research and gives him emotional and professional support.<br /><br />The one thing I enjoyed about this movie was that it was very realistic in its portrayal of life in 1959. You really get a strong sense of the era as you watch the movie. People were so much more innocent and naive back then, and it really comes across in the movie. Director Bennett Miller really knows how to give the movie the feel for the times.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|As a Coltrane nut, I've had the legendary \\"One Down, One Up\\" on bootleg for years, and it's long been my single favorite Coltrane performance. And I'm very pleased with this purchase. The sound quality for all four tracks is much improved over the bootlegs, even if it doesn't match the 1961 Vanguard shows recorded by Impulse's Bob Thiele. There's an extended bass intro to One Up One Down that I hadn't heard, and even the complete radio announcements are historically interesting. <br /> <br />The dropouts that a few reviewers mention for the title track are really not a problem, if you can accept the fact that the master tapes aren't in pristine condition. There are no actual gaps in the performance, and the brief drops in volume were done well and aren't jarring. <br /> <br />As Coltrane collectors know, there are four radio broadcasts from the Half Note from 1965 widely traded as bootlegs. This package includes two of them, complete. I sure hope the Coltrane estate also has master-quality copies of the other two broadcasts.
B0000041DZ|5.0|Brendel is pretty much one of the most reputed performers of Beethoven along with Rubinstein, Van Cliburn, Horowitz, and Perrhia. Some reviewers have recommended Ashkenazy but I personally find him to to be the most overrated piano virtuoso whose performances are barely worthy of a 4 on the Amazon scale.  Usually dry and out of synch with the meter, his performances for Beethoven are not to my pallet.  In terms of the best performer of anything for the Romantic period on piano it is unquestionably Rubinstein but I don't believe he performed all of the sonatas and there is no boxed set. This box set is a complete set of Beethoven's piano sonatas at somewhat of a steep but common price with one of the few best performances of Beethoven's piano sonatas.  I found Brendel's performance just fine particularly in playing out the ranges in tonality prevalent in these pieces.  His interpretation of the meter gives his performance the right pace compared to Ashkenazy who doesn't seem to know whether he should slow down, remain in place, or speed up his interpretations.  Overall it is a set of exemplary performances.  I am happy to have purchased this set and I don't regret it one bit.  Brendel is a specialist in Beethoven and I have found few who match his talent for his works: Ashkenazy is certainly not one of them in my book.
B0009R1T7M|3.0|There is a time and place for screaming music, and I'm never prepared for it when I accidently listen to this album.  It makes me want to run into walls and take an axe to a frog's throat...just because.  The sudden time shifts make it feel like I can speed up and slow down time.  But the long instrumental parts get a little too weird for my taste. <br /> <br />I just gave Sufjan Stevens 5 stars; maybe Dillinger Escape Plan could learn something from them?
B00006BTCA|5.0|I like to listen to this when I am in the mood to create art. Early on, it seemed to be 'background music' (it's not too distracting to what I am working on). Yet, it seems to seep into my sub-conscious and has become more and more intriguing. In the time that I've listened to it, it has continued to grow on me. I hope that it continues to evolve with me and inspire me.
B00004XONN|1.0|Zero one one one zero one zero zero zero zero one one zero one zero one zero one one one one one one one one one <br /> <br />FOR EARTHLINGS, A CONTEXTUAL TRANSLATION IS DISPLAYED BELOW: <br /> <br />the sound of a dying pig was used to impregnate your mother. <br /> <br />I preferred their vastly superior album Zooropa.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|like everyone else leaving reviews, i've been a huge fan of dm since i first heard them (\\"get the balance right\\" was my first).  if this album was by anyone else, i'd think it was pretty good, it's just that i expected so much more, especially after the very unexcitable \\"exciter\\".  i miss the huge drumbeats from previous works & was hoping that they'd finally be back on this one.  so many tracks just sound like unfinished work.  i guess it just bums me out because i'm realizing that the great dm is gone.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Having read what others have to say about this movie, I thought I'd add my own thoughts. I found the movie to be worth watching, despite the fact that the main character, Balian of Ibelin was not portrayed as the man I've read of in histories of the Crusades. Balian was a well known, and powerful member of the Court of Jerusulem, not somebody newly arrived from Western Europe. I think that other characters, such as Guy of Lusingnan, Reynauld,and the Grand Master of the Knights of the Temple were very close to what we know of the historical figures. Saladin did, indeed, be head Reynauld with his own hand,and, except for the Grand Master of the Templars, all members of the Military Orders captured at the battle of Hattin were beheaded. Balian of Ibelin was captured at Hattin, but was released and given leave by Saladin to return to Jerusulem to find his family. Once there, the people of the city begged Balian to command the defence of the city. The Battle of Hattin was a disaster of epic proportions for the Kingdom: almost all of the kingdom's fighting men were either killed or captured. The disaster was largely the work of three men: Gerard of Ridefort, Grand Master of the Temple, King Guy, and Reynauld of Chatillon. had the wiser counsel of men like Balian of Ibelin and Tiberious prevailed, the Christian Army would not have marched away from their secure camp. Heat and lack of water were major factors in the defeat of the Chritian Army. <br />   In my opinion, the screenplay remained closer to known history than did the screenplay of the movie, 'Braveheart.' If a better movie about the crusades exists, I haven't seen it. <br />    My only major disagreement in how this movie was made lies in the storyline dealing with Balian's origins, and his relationship with Sibylla. There was a shortlived attempt to put the husband of Sibylla's younger sister, Humphrey of Toron, on the throne. Humphrey had no desire to be king, and the crowning of Guy, a newcomer lately come from the West, led to the disastrous Battle of Hattin and the end of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusulem. <br />     I found the movie well worth watching, and would like to remind others, that if you want the whole story as told in History books, don't look for it in a movie, go to more reliable sources.
B000B5IPLK|4.0|I have enjoyed this cd. I wasn't able to watch the actual show on MTV, but I felt as if I were right there in the audience. It has all of my favorites songs from her album all in one.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|This was a great movie for the sole fact that it was actually like the book.  For those of you who hate it for that fact that it isn't Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it was never meant to be a re-make at all.  If you've ever read the book then you might have an idea what I'm talking about here.  I will admit that Depp was a little strange as Wonka, but it worked quite well and was very true to the book.  I personally thought that Wilder didn't really do the Wonka from the book justice.  The other part I love about this is the squirrels!  The geese that lay golden eggs was the worst compromise they could have made for the Willy Wonka movie.  I'm not saying that the old movie was terrible or anything, but it really didn't follow the book closely at all.
B0000029GA|5.0|bother rating illmatic. it's obviously 5 stars. it's obviously perfect. its not like it needs a positive review. but damn, i'm listening to it now and i just want to show love.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Beware: I have never heard anything from Green Day besides Time of Your Life. I decided to purchase this album after hearing Church On Sunday and it is no doubt one of my favourite CDs. I can not believe I haven't given these talented guys a listen before now!  <br /> <br />All the songs are catchy, deep, up-beat, intelligent with great beats and cool edges.  <br /> <br />1. Warning is a song about questioning everything and is the perfect song to start this CD off. 4/5 <br /> <br />2. The chorus is extremely catchy and there's deeper meaning. Such a fun song. It's too short, though. 4/5 <br /> <br />3. My favourite Green Day song. The instruments and lyrics are amazing. It gives me chills. 100/5 <br /> <br />4. Yet a fantastic, up-beat, fun and ironic song about being a fashion victim. 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Great chorus. About going at it alone. Not one of my favourites, but still very good. Great solos. 3/5 <br /> <br />6. This is a story-song. It's mid-tempo and has a weird tune to it. Poorest track on CD. 2/5 <br /> <br />7. Cool song about deadbeat losers. 3/5 <br /> <br />8. Another favourite. So catchy and you can relate to. 5/5 <br /> <br />9. Great, catchy and fun song about wasting time. 5/5 <br /> <br />10. Re-make of the 50s song Downtime. It's raw and original, but not so catchy. 3/5 <br /> <br />11. Strong song about authority. No doubt it's Green Day! Extremely catchy. 5/5 <br /> <br />12. The only slow song. About putting your heart on the line without knowing the outcome. 5/5

0399152717|1.0|I dove into this book and the story began to grab me. This is necessary to keep me in past the first few pages. As I continued on I found myself making excuses for the author and trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. I really wanted to enjoy it. <br />Unfortunately, the book reads like an outline that was strictly followed which produces the effect of things falling neatly into place. It was a little too predictable. At times the story breaches too far into the fantasy realm which makes it painful because one can only suspend reality so far. <br />What really bothered me was the science and technology referred to by the so called experts of the book. It all came available far too conveniently. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but something about the \\"facts\\" just didn't seem right. I found myself questioning the author's research. It seemed like he was just pulling the stuff out of his head. I wanted to believe the facts were straight as it is essential to enjoying the story. When I read a thriller I need to believe that the events just might actually be possible. This book left me in doubt.  <br />Still, I continued on, hoping that things would work out. That is when the bombshell hit me. The plot sends some of the characters down to Rio de Janeiro which anyone who has taken Geology 101 would know is a state and a city (the author doesn't specify which) in Brazil. With five minutes worth of research on the internet one can easily ascertain the national language of Brazil. In the book the author has his characters speaking Spanish in Rio de Janeiro and that is the problem. You would have more luck speaking English in Rio than Spanish. Why? Because the national language in Brazil is Portuguese! Brazilians hear a little English at school and on TV but unless they live on a border with one of the surrounding Spanish speaking countries they wouldn't know any Spanish at all. Rio is nowhere near a border. How do I know all this, because I am a Brazilian from Riode Janeiro. Portuguese is about as similar to Spanish as Italian is. Spanish would get you nowhere in Rio - nowhere. Especially not with some uneducated guard working a night shift at a Rio boat dock. If you didn't speak Portuguese, he wouldn't understand you. Not a chance. This blew the whole book for me.  <br />I'm sorry that the author didn't know that the Portuguese conquistadors settled Brazil. I'm sorry that he didn't do his research. Mostly, I'm just sorry that I wasted a few hours of my life on this book.  <br />With all the money there is to be made off of writing these books it seems to me that it would be worth while to go to Rio and throw in some actual details to make the entire book more authentic. You know, some street names, local establishments, and uh... the actual language that they speak there. Am I asking too much? <br />The most important question is, \\"How can I be expected to swallow any of the highly technical information in the book or the facts on NUMA if the author didn't even research the national language of Brazil so his characters wouldn't look foolish speaking Spanish to a Portuguese speaking guard?\\" I can't.  <br />I walked away from this book thinking, \\"Maybe I'll just write my own\\". <br />

B0006718A8|5.0|Enough others have talked about the music presented on this disc. It's good - very good - and a testament to the musicians presenting it. Plenty more reviews available for the standard version. This review is of the DualDisc. <br /> <br />Dualdiscs are a relatively new piece of technology - a CD on one side, DVD on the other, and offer a number of advantages, as well as a few problems. The CD side does not conform to the \\"redbook\\" CD standard, and as such cannot be played on all CD players (this is a side effect of the thickness of the DualDisc). I've seen estimates ranging from 2% to 30% incompatibility, so be aware of this. The CD side seems to be especially problematic in computer DVD drives, so if you're purchasing a DualDisc and intending to rip the material to mp3, try to borrow a disc first to check that it will work correctly. Also, the extra thickness and double sided nature of the discs means you shouldn't use them in slot loading CD players like most car stereos or multi-disc juke boxes. All that said, I haven't had problems playing the CD side of any of my DualDiscs. <br />The DVD side is the same standard as normal DVDs, and can be played on any DVD player or drive. This offers slightly higher quality stereo playback (although I defy anyone to hear the difference) and often Dolby 5.1 playback, as well as an opportunity for extras. <br /> <br />On this DualDisc, the music is presented with a number of student films which are hardly worth the time to view, and a film of Yo-Yo Ma and Ennio Morricone talking about each other - the sort of gushing that would perhaps better be kept in private. If you do not have and do not expect ever to own a system capable of 5.1 playback, I would not recommend purchasing this DualDisc. But if you have 5.1 playback, it is a revalation. The difference between stereo and 5.1 is like night and day. The sound become more open, immersive, and defined. The rear channels are not overused - most of the time you'll be hard pressed to hear them at all - but take them away and you notice their absense. Sparingly, they are used to provide an aural backdrop such as the use of choir, and each time the effect is stunning. It's hard to put a finger on precisely why the 5.1 mix sounds so much better, but it more alive, involving, and emotive, and very, very worth the premium required to buy the DualDisc version of this album. <br /> <br />DualDiscs are, for the most part, a waste of time if they only contain stereo tracks or if you can't play back in 5.1. If you have a home theater, then buy this disc and enjoy a masterful soundscape and experience.
0792164903|4.0|Tim Burton clearly enjoys his craft. Like BATMAN, BEETLEJUICE, and every other Burton feature, everything about SLEEPY HOLLOW looks and feels right. The colors are slightly washed out, giving the film a creepy, slightly surreal nature; trees don't just grow upward, but rather gnarl themselves into screaming wooden sculptures -- atmosphere and sets are as important as characterization in a Burton piece, and SLEEPY HOLLOW never disappoints in any of these elements. Like any Burton film, SLEEPY HOLLOW -- as a film -- is well worth watching. Sure, it's really nothing like the book, but that's beside the point -- Irving's original story was mostly about mood, and that's what Burton is after here. So, forget the plot, which is really nothing more than a Scooby Doo mystery (except the ghost is real), and concentrate on watching -- as Burton calls Depp in the commentary -- \\"Ichabod Crane, Girl Detective\\" try to unsnarl the mysteries in Sleepy Hollow. If there's any cause for disappointment, it's with the commentary track. The commentary certainly has its moments -- such as Burton's constant guffaws at Jeffrey Jones' impossibly huge wig, or his use of the word \\"amazing\\" so many times that you'll start counting them -- but if you're looking for some behind-the-scenes moments or discussion of the craft of specific scenes, you won't find much of it here. Still, SLEEPY HOLLOW is Burton at his finest
B0009WFFS6|5.0|The 2005 concert compares favorably to the reissue of the 1968 Albert Hall Concert. For those who never saw the original concert, this is still a great jam band. For those of us who grew up with Cream, I would have to say the rhythm section (Baker and Bruce) don't quite have the same driving energy level that made Cream a unique driving force back in 1968. But then that's to be expected now that two of them are in the '60s. <br />  <br />  Cream's never-to-be-imitated secret formula was that Bruce and Baker played rock with a jazz approach with Clapton hanging on for dear life with his blues riffs. Now it's somewhat toned down but still very presentable. What they now lack in energy is made up for in vocal precision which used to be a little sloppy in the old days when instrumentation was the main focus. <br /> <br />  Clapton is still playing some killer blues riffs. Ginger's not doing his fiery drum solos, but hey..the guy IS 65. What's priceless are the occasional glances between Bruce and the others which seem to say \\"I'm glad to be here with you guys and the magic is still there.\\" Also the adoration of the audience many of whom waited all these years to see such a momentous reunion performance.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Broken is a great album, pure and simple. In my opinion, this is the pinnacle of all of Trent's heavier efforts; unrelenting, sharp, focused, and very, very good. What makes it such an effective record, in my mind, is how you can listen to it song to song casually or as a single, cohesive piece of work. Every song flows into the next, building intensity up and tearing it down again violently and without warning, making the initial listening experience a visceral, on-edge affair. I defy you not to jump in your seat as \\"Help Me I Am in Hell\\" screams into \\"Happiness in Slavery,\\" especially if you have the volume up (like I did) to hear every nuance of the brittle guitar strum and the muted storm brewing in the background. After \\"Gave Up\\" erodes into complete electronic chaos, the 92 second break creates a kind of calm before the kiddie-grinder coughs back to life, and a pair of covers, \\"Physical\\" and \\"Suck,\\" wrap it all up.  <br /> <br />In summation, the high points on this album are many and the low points are few (if any). Please purchase if you haven't already.
B00008RH3L|4.0|It difficult today to recall that, when this movie came out in 1990, a lot of critics panned it, calling the characters cartoon caricatures and the story stilted and unwieldy.<br /><br />Now, 15 years later and in a time when its players -- Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro and Jon Polito -- have all made big names for themselves, we can look back on this as one of the Coen brothers most inspired and entertaining films. It is the equal, in my opinion, of \\"Fargo\\" and \\"Barton Fink\\" and way ahead of their drowsy comedies of recent years starring big budget players like George Clooney and Katherine Zeta Jones.<br /><br />If you've never seen it, \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is a crossroads in the country near the unnamed city where Italian and Irish gangsters are duking it out for control. Gabriel Byrne's character is the linchpin between the warring groups, first as the top associate to Irish mob chief Albert Finney and, later, as part of Jon Polito's Italian mob after he seemingly switches allegiance.<br /><br />But does he switch? You'll really be entertained trying to figure that out! You'll also be entertained by a number of miraculous scenes -- the best of which is Finney fighting off killers in his bedroom and putting some more out of action with one of the best machine gun scenes in film history to the tunes of \\"Danny Boy\\". You'll also get a great kick out of a shootout at a speakeasy and a scene with fighter \\"Drop\\" Johnson -- one of the greatest names a Hollywood character has ever had.<br /><br />All this and America's best character actor, John Turturro, too!<br /><br />I'm getting carried away with enthusiasm but I can't help it when I think of this worderful, offbeat yet terribly mainstream and entertaining mob movie. There's never been one like it and probably never will be one like it. Buy it, rent it or borrow it tongiht and see how much fun you can have for a couple hours with his group of madcap gangsters.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|It shouldn't matter if they are or if they aren't lesbians. They've stated it's not about that and they never labeled themselves as such because they don't believe in labeling emotions/feelings.<br /><br />The point of the matter is about the music and this album is one of the best I've ever heard. The music is wonderful and the lyrics are full of feeling and love.<br /><br />It's a wonderful album and I would recommend it to anyone.
B000AY807Q|5.0|I've been a fan of Neil's since I first heard Mr. Soul with Buffalo Springfeild and after hearing/seeing this combo CD/DVD, I know why I keep coming back! Whether he's electric or acoustic,he's a wordsmith of the 1st order. <br /> <br />This is Neil via acoustic with musicians who've been on 'Harvest', 'Comes a Time', 'Harvest Moon' and more. The central connection between most of the songs has to do with his roots growing up in Canada and you get a sense of memories that were the building blocks of who he is as an adult. The folk singer musician once again stands out here with wonderful arrangements for pedal steel, piano, dobro, sax, drums, backing vocals and tamborine. <br /> <br />This is a MUST for any Neil Young collection and I've about got 'em all!
B000002UA0|4.0|I confess to having a weakness for psychadelic music.  Done right, as it is here, it is delightfully weird.  The album does have some flaws which are common to the type, including a occasional surplus of \\"cute\\" and some attempts at humor that just seem dated.  Recommended if you enjoy this sort of thing.  Little or no resemblance to the Dark Side of the Moon stuff for which they later became famous.

B00000JMOF|5.0|There have been countless versions around this mythic fable with the underlying statement of man playing tobe God. I'd rather say Dr. Frankenstein is an irreverent enemy of the Status Quo. Obvioulsy he has crossed a forbidden barrier, and the violation that limit will entail him an intersting lessonof life.<br /><br />The fundamental inside the dramatic structure is the great influence that wisely Whale took borrowed from the German Expressionism; those marvelous lights and shadows counterpoints and the impressive performance of Boris Karloff making of the creature, initially a clumsy monster who simply ignores all about the rules of the world.<br /><br />On the other hand you must remind the obligated reference to The Cabinet of Dr.Caligari; here you have : both dramatic premises that eventually, will interweave to create the most expressive and by far best reading of this legend.<br /><br />A cult movie for a long, long time.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|I love to watch perilous situations and to watch how they use such great special effects. If you are a fan of these kind of movies, I suggest you check out \\"Dante's Peak\\", it is also another one of my all time favorites in perilous movies!
B00065MDSG|5.0|Bob Fripp really found a winner in Bill Bruford for a drummer. His technique is a highlight to this album,such as his odd time signatures and using rimshots on tracks such as \\"Easy Money\\" and \\"Larks Tongues Part 2\\". John Wetton gives a solid performance on vocals in his raspy delivery and, of course, Fripp shows is masterful guitar work. The only weak portion is the \\"Talking Drum\\" which is the free improv playing, which is listenable and still quite good, but not a song to pick a favorite part. The rest is flawless. \\"Larks Tongues Part 1\\" can be sweet one minute and blowing your mind another. The two guitar riffs are just so heavy, really awesome work. Never ceasing to amaze, it gets quieter and the violin comes in and at the end, it playing gets more frantic and voices come from the background. \\"Book of Saturdays\\" is a short, melodic song with no drums. It holds on it's own as the singing and guitar intertwine to give a lamenting feel. \\"Exiles\\" is a beautiful song where the violin really shows and like \\"Saturdays\\", the singing is top notch thanks to Wetton. \\"Easy Money\\" is where Bruford shows his chops on the drums like I mentioned before with correctly placed bass and guitar to give it a more hard edge than that of the others. \\"Larks Tongue Part 2\\" is the best example oof musicians playing off each other. Both Fripp and Bruford shine on this instrumental and it is the best way to end such a classic album. Definite recommendation along with the rest of the King Crimson Catalog from '69 to '74(In the Court of the Crimson King to Red).

B000B5IPLK|5.0|Ms. Keys had done it again with this spectacular album.  Although most of the songs are renditions of songs she has done on her two previous albums, \\"Songs in a Minor\\" and \\"Diary\\", she does have a few new songs that are done wonderfully. \\"Wild Horses\\" with Adam Levine is one of my favorites and I also like the Streets of NY.  There is a beauty to her voice that is indescribable.  Even if you own the other cds, if you are a true A. Keys fan you need this one because it is her LIVE performance! This shows the real art of her style.
B000028U0Y|5.0|To someone who has never heard a Johnny Cash song, Cash could easily be labeled a cliche, a product, an archetype of bad-boy-gone-good, a sham, a shakedown. None of these generalizations are accurate.  <br />Cash did not dwell in the cheesy sentimentality and easy, sweet crooning most commonly associated with country, and even when the songs weren't his, he made them his own. A song stylist in his own right, Johnny Cash could imbue a tender and sad quality to the rowdiest, devil-may-care anthems. Listening to this album, one gets the sense that if Cash is an outlaw, he is still secretly drawn to the life of an insider: while he sneers at the righteous man, he secretly envies him; while he curses God for his injustice, he pleads to him for atonement; while he does his best to damn all the world to hell, in the quietest moments, he still believes in it. This is what is compelling. <br />The audience, too, has a palpable reaction to each change in tone: while most live albums are lo-fi and contain little interaction with the artist beyond the occasional cheers, Folsom Prison is a perfect environment for Cash's ruffian persona to shake its tailfeathers. Slow and taciturn, Cash guides the appreciative audience from mood to mood, all the while maintaining a familiar backbeat and bare-bones honky-tonk instrumental section. Because the captive audience (see what I did there?) will return, after the concert, to a brutal, sub-human existence, this album particularly holds the interest and makes one think, making their temporary freedom that much sweeter--and that much more tragic--than our own. <br />Not to be missed, either, are the liner notes, written by Johnny Cash himself, on the prison experience. This album serves as a sad and tantalizing trip through the lower depths of American Darkness.
B0000DEPDZ|5.0|What do you say about one of the greatest albums of the rock era? Do you say that at the end of their career as a group that these four individuals, talented individually and phenomenally gifted as a group, came together to create something magical? Sure, why not. But even that would be an understatement. When describing a performance this good, you get to the point where words alone fail. Artistry with words fails to describe the artistry with music, which is as it should be.<br /><br />\\"Abbey Road\\" was an interesting combination of music. Much of the album is a collection of songs that was and is the envy of lesser talents, and remains a standard of excellence for others against which to compare. Part of the album was a grouping of songs that transitioned from one to the next seamlessly and wonderfully, beginning with \\"You Never Gave Me Your Money\\" and ending with \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window.\\" The Moody Blues had performed similar transitions in \\"Days of Future Passed,\\" and overlapping of songs was a tradition for them on all their albums, but to do rock transitions from one song to the next was novel.<br /><br />What songs! Songs from hard rock (well, it was hard then) such as \\"Come Together\\" and \\"I Want You,\\" mellow ballads such as \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" a bizarre synthesized \\"Because,\\" and quirky novelty songs like \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden.\\" It was as though the group knew they were nearing the end and was putting out pieces of this and that with exquisite finesse and skill. The breadth of music on this one album is incredible, and shows why The Beatles remain (in my humble opinion) the greatest rock group of all time to this day. They gave so much in creating rock music as we know it, and this album was their last brilliant hurrah.<br /><br />There's nothing more to say. This album is a must-have for any Beatles fan, for any aficionado of 60s music, and for anyone that appreciates the talent required to create the range of songs on this CD. Throw yourself back more than 30 years and imagine what it was like to have lived in the time when the lads were still young, and music like this was genius.create the range of songs on this CD.

B000AQBA1W|5.0|This album contains no pop and radio-friendly songs so if you think \\"Breathless\\" is their best song, this album is not-4-U.

I like all the songs on the album, especially \\"Dimming of the Day\\" where Sharon sings lead and she sounds INCREDIBLE!!!!. Well worth the $$$$
B00006JKOL|5.0|After \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"War Child\\" were such huge successes, I was worried that Jethro Tull had, as Frank Zappa phrased it, gone commercial. \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" corrected that notion. \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" returns Tull to their original self-defined genre.<br /><br />I always get a kick out of people trying to fit Jethro Tull into any particular type of music, because they are just plain not anything. While they have elements of hard rock/metal, elements of pop, elements of progressive, elements of folk, elements of renaissance, and even a bit of classical here and there, they are all of the above and none of the above. They just are.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\", begins with hammering and noises that make it sound as though the group is on a stage that is being prepared for a play. The song then transitions into a bard-like minstrel song, and then takes off into a hard rock song. An excellent opening song that sets you up for the things to come.<br /><br />\\"Cold Wind to Valhalla\\" won't fool you. There are some violins and flavor of folk/renaissance, but at around 1 minute and 45 seconds into the song it switches into overdrive and you realize you are listening to a solidly rock song. Excellent use of violins in this song to help the orchestration. Hard to believe that violins can be a hard-rock instrument.<br /><br />You hear classic Jethro Tull in the beginning of \\"Black Satin Dancer\\", then some hard rock riffs, and you suspect what will come next in this song. And you would be right and wrong. This song is a sensual song with allusions of sexual foreplay and intense longing, perhaps even lust. Sometimes I felt some occasional elements of King Crimson, and then not. The hard rock elements intertwine with classic Tull and some occasional progressive flashes. A most excellent song.<br /><br />Then you are lulled by the melancholy strains of \\"Requiem\\", as Ian Anderson and company sound more like Kansas or Simon and Garfunkel, and yet, the sound is still Tull. This song is meant to be listened to for the feel, and not for the words.<br /><br />Then, as you move into \\"One White Duck/0^10 = Nothing at All\\" you realize that \\"Requiem\\" was a perfect transition between \\"Black Satin Dancer\\" and this song. I love this song, because it seems to have meaning, and seems to have no meaning, and you hover on the edge of understanding without understanding, though you think you should, and could, if you could listen a little longer and read the lyrics just one more time. But this song is, of course, classic Tull, and the lyrics do mean something, but they are art, and art is for the interpretation of the listener. Don't make too much of this song, and don't make too little. Just listen and love it.<br /><br />Then, off to signature Tull, the extended, intertwined story-song, \\"Baker St. Muse\\". Here you have an intro about a muse, a very down-to-earth fellow crying out that Jethro Tull wasn't the commercial group that \\"War Child\\" seemed to make them out to be. We are in the gutter like we always were, singing about the things that haven't changed, and so on to the next part of our story...<br /><br />The other songs are stories of the street, likely stories of the Baker St. Muse (aka Jethro Tull). These songs are very sexual. Today they might even get a warning label, even though there is no use of the crude words which seem so popular. There is no need; the point is well made without resorting to a limited, non-descriptive vocabulary. This group of songs finishes with \\"Mother England Reverie\\", which is a protestation that the singer is just a street player, a muse, and he'll never be anything but.<br /><br />The CD finishes with a wrap-up song, \\"Grace\\", which is a marvelous little epilogue that not only finishes the CD, but also asks a simple, but layered question, \\"Hello breakfast. May I buy you again tomorrow?\\" In the context of the CD the question more likely means, can we be here tomorrow, can we still dowhat we are doing? And perhaps, in consideration of the other songs, will anyone care.<br /><br />Sometimes I think of the songs, coming after the nearly-pop success of \\"Warchild\\", as being an apology for straying from the principles of Jethro Tull's music and style. Perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps not. Regardless, listening to the seven albums before Warchild, and then \\"Warchild\\", and then \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\", you realize that \\"Warchild\\" was not Tull's usual music, and \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" put them squarely back where they once were.<br /><br />Jethro Tull has never been everyman's group. Never will. They occupy a unique place in modern music that will likely never be defined. This CD is solidly at the heart of the kind of music Jethro Tull is known for making. It is among the best of Jethro Tull.<br /><br />This remastered version adds five additional songs of varying value, \\"Summerdays Sands,\\" \\"March the Mad Scientist,\\" \\"Pan Dance,\\" a live version of \\"Minstrel in the Gallery,\\" and a live version of \\"Cold Wind to Valhalla.\\"  This CD is worth having in your collection if you have yet to buy it.  If you have it already and have a great stereo the remaster is also worth having.  If you have it and you have a cheap stereo (like me), the remaster is probably not necessary unless you have to have the extra songs.w, can we still do what we are doing?

B00008G484|5.0|Madonna's music has varied from her first album to her last. Her music is probably not evolutionary because there appears to be little in the way of progression from \\"Material Girl\\" to the techno tracks of \\"Music\\". I do think that Madonna has taken the opportunity as a successful artist to experiment with her music, trying something new, sometimes new age, sometimes progressive, always trying to find what works for her.<br /><br />Throughout her career, one thing has been a constant for Madonna: She has the voice to carry beautiful ballads. This CD is a collection of some of the most beautiful music Madonna has ever sang. While not truly a greatest hits, many of the songs were in fact hits. The goal of this album appears to be similar to that of Elton John's \\"Love Songs\\" CD, where Elton's mellow music was similarly collected. Madonna's CD could also have been titled \\"Love Songs\\", but of course that title was already taken, and the title reflects one of her hits included on this CD.<br /><br />\\"This Used to Be My Playground\\" from \\"A League of Their Own\\", an outstanding song, \\"You'll See\\", perhaps Madonna's best song of all time (my opinion!), \\"I'll Remember\\" from \\"With Honors\\", \\"Take a Bow\\", and \\"Something to Remember\\" are among the highlights that exercise a voice that can be as absolutely gorgeous as the artist with the voice. I could include most of the other songs on this CD as well, but these particular songs carry feelings that lesser artists would either have difficult to convey, or be unable to convey at all. I sometimes feel so melancholy after listening to \\"You'll See\\", that I sometimes get watery eyes.<br /><br />Any downsides to this CD? I admit I'm not very enthused about \\"Forbidden Love\\". It's not a bad song, but it hardly seems on par with the other songs on this CD. Okay, it's a small thing, hardly worth noticing.<br /><br />There are so few singers that have a voice that is an instrument by itself. Madonna has a voice that belongs in that small group. This CD gives a sampling of the capability of that instrument. If you enjoy mellow music, and particularly if you enjoy Madonna's mellow music, this CD is a must have.<br /><br />Note that this particular version is an import, and there is at least one additional version available.

B0007TKNL0|2.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is one of the most popular musicals of all time and an undeniably exciting experience in the theater.  With its lush music, spectacular design, and slick direction by Harold Prince, the stage version already has a cinematic quality that you'd think would be a natural fit for film. Certainly \\"Phantom\\" would seem an easier film to make than say, Lloyd Webber's \\"Evita,\\" which, despite its real-life subject, has a spare, surreal quality on stage.  But the film \\"Evita,\\" in the capable hands of director Alan Parker, turned out to be quite brilliant--  the great score was enhanced by stunning cinematography and authentic art direction, as well as some really fine performances (yes, including Madonna's).   But, alas, Lloyd Webber trusted Joel Schumacher with this one-- that's right: he chose the director responsible for those much-hated grotesqueries \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\" to adapt his most famous work for film.  Not a good decision.   <br /> <br />Now, to be fair, Lloyd Webber seemed to have based his choice on the fact that Schumacher directed the enjoyable teen vampire flick \\"The Lost Boys\\" in the 80's.  That film does give some indication that Schumacher could handle the gothic romance and supernatural elements that make \\"Phantom\\" so compelling on stage.  One only wishes the composer had followed up on the director's career before offering the job.  The \\"Phantom\\" film is less \\"Lost Boys\\" and very much more in the same hit- 'em- over- the-head, cartoonish style as Schumacher's Batman movies.  If he was going to choose a \\"Batman\\" director, it should have been Tim Burton.    <br /> <br />       The best thing about the film is Emmy Rossum, who really is just about perfect as the ingenue Christine Da'ae:  Great voice, right age and look, good acting ability.   There is also some nice cinematography, especially during \\"All I Ask of You,\\" the rooftop love duet between Christine and Raoul (Patrick Wilson). The rest of the movie is horribly miscalculated.   <br /> <br /> Aside from Rossum, the performances are weak.  Gerard Butler as the Phantom and Minnie Driver as the opera diva Carlotta, are simply too over-the-top and downright corny.   Someone, presumably Shumacher, should have reminded the cast that this is a film and not the stage production.  On stage, you can get away with a little overacting-- the theatrical emoting is needed to reach everyone in the theater.  On film, with the benefit of things like close-ups and editing, you can be more subtle.   There is a whole lot of ridiculous mugging go on here.  <br /> <br /> In fact, a little more subtlety across the board could have made this a much better film.  I know many would say that Lloyd Webber's score is anything but subtle, and that's probably true.    But the stage version of \\"Phantom,\\" is sort of understated in some important ways.   Above all, the show coasts on the music more than character development and plot.  The music is so emotionally involving that you hardly notice that you really know next to nothing about Christine or the Phantom, or anyone else.  And it works really well.  On stage, the emotional pull of the music and the staging fills in the gaps in the storytelling.  There really is a spare, mysterious quality to \\"Phantom\\" on stage that is completely absent from the film.   <br /> <br /> The film is full of distracting and unnecessary additions.  Shumacher goes to great lengths to strip the musical of its mystery and gothic elements-- what was dark, brooding, and mysterious on stage is now too colorful, too flamboyant, and utterly devoid of anything supernatural.   The film goes out of its way to explain all the Phantom's actions in entirely practical terms.  For instance, Carlotta does not mysteriously lose her voice by potentially otherworldly means.  No, here, the Phantom is seen blatantly placing a presumably poisoned bottle of throat spray within her reach.  Least forgivable is a silly flashback scene with a voice over by Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) explaining the Phantom's origin.  On stage, her explanation is quick and vague, almost a throwaway--  it's much better that way.  Do we really need everything spelled out for us?   <br /> <br /> The big musical numbers, which should be the highlight, are dragged down by bad choices.  Everything is too busy.The most ludicrous example of this comes during \\"Point of No Return,\\" which should be an emotional highpoint.  The Phantom appears disguised on stage during the performance of his opera, and his duet with Christine doubles as a commentary on their complex relationship.  Instead of focusing squarely on the Phantom and Christine, Schumacher undermines the emotion of the scene by intercutting images of some entirely inappropriate and laughably modern- seeming backup dancers.  Why? <br />  <br /> At the end of the day, this is just a bad adaptation of a good musical.  I hate the idea that anyone who hasn't seen the stage version would form an opinion based on this film.  In fact, it would have been wiser, more entertaining, and immeasurably cheaper, if they had just filmed a stage performance and distributed that.    <br />

B0002XNSY0|2.0|For English this year our fabulous teacher, Mr.Black decided to bless us by giving us the privilage of watching \\"Dr.Strangelove\\" in class. In my opinion the movie is interesting but not that funny. It keeps you wondering what is going to happen next but did not seem to bring out many chuckles from me. In order to laugh though, you would need to have some backround information on the story and know some history to really get thi jist of what was going on. I would often find Mr.Black stopping the movie to explain what was goin on, this made it make more sense to me but if he wasn't there to explain to me I dont think I would have gotten what was going on.  <br /> <br />If I were a sixteen year old ( which I am) I would not go out of my way on the weekend to rent or buy Dr,Strangelove. But considering the circumstances of being in english in the middle of the school day the movie was quite a blessing being alot more interesting and funny than any documentary or boring, library barrowed, video on the digestive system.  <br /> <br />One thing this movie is good at showing is satire. Satire is something making a point but being humorous at the same time. A good example of this is at the end of the movie the \\"John Wayne\\" type hero goes down to the bomb doors becuase they will not open. He then fixes the problem and is sitting on the bomb with the doors wide open. The nuclear bomb falls and he is left riding it down to the nuclear silo of the \\" Ruskies\\". This is satirizing an everday \\"Hic\\" or \\"Redneck\\" American, a man screaming at the top of his lungs \\"YEEE HAAHH\\" with a big gun and no the greatest feelings towards american enemys.

Overall, a very fine performance by all involved <br />including a \\"pick up\\" orchestra that could hold it's own with <br />anyone. I highly recommend this video. You'll smile when you hear it!

Though that so far hasn't affected the running of the software, it gives a bad feeling. <br /> <br />Moreover, many aspects of the software isn't user friendly. You can  copy only one definition at a time, can't use arrow key to move to drop down items, can't change the font and many more. <br /> <br />Though these are at best trivial, an improved version could be much more easy to use.
0345350499|3.0|Highly developed characters evolve as events unfold.  The author vividly portrays the complex and sometimes conflicting motivations that inform an individual's actions.  I found myself sympathizing with almost all of the characters.  Whether you agree with them or not, the author presents their different points of view with great clarity.<br /><br />The storylines revolve around politics and religion, with power as one central theme.  The various modes of wielding power employed by the women is still reflected in our society today.  The conflict between religion and spirituality is another major theme.  Like all goood fantasy, Mists allows the exploration of relevant ideas and topics.<br /><br />Zimmer Bradley's prose is fluid, and although long, I zipped right through this book.  The only other Arthurian legends novel I've tried to date has been White's The Once and Future King.  Although it's apples and oranges to compare the two, if asked I'd say, skip TOAF King and go for Mists of Avalon.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed this one, I don't plan to read the sequels anytime soon.  There are so many wildly different things on my reading list, and for now at least, my appetite for Arthur's court has been deliciously satisfied.
B000002L80|5.0|In the beginning of the film 'Stop Making Sense', we see a lone David Byrne walking up to a large stage with a tape recorder. \\"There's a tape I want you to hear\\", he says, and plays the monotonic rhythm of 'Psycho Killer'. As the concert goes on, more musicians join him on stage V first the core band members, and then percussionists, guitar players and backup singers, until finally the stage is crowded. <br /> <br />This, in a nutshell, is the story of the Talking Heads' development up to the point of 'Stop Making Sense'. Under the watchful eye of master-producer Brian Eno (whose amazing list of collaborators also includes David Bowie, Devo, U2, John Cale and Robert Fripp, among many others) the band grew from the shady art-rock semi-punk band that created such anti-culture semi-hits as 'Psycho Killer' and 'Love  Building On Fire', through electronics and ethnic influences, into the avant-garde new-wave supergroup that created masterpieces like 'Fear of Music' and 'Remain In Light', a process that reached its peak after Eno left the group, under Byrne's direction, with 'Speaking in Tongues' and 'Stop Making Sense'. <br /> <br />'Little Creatures' is considered by many fans and critics to be the beginning of the end for Talking Heads, and where they gave in to commercialism. 'Little Creatures' is often underappreciated and misunderstood, especially by avid fans of the Heads, because it was a decisive change in direction for them. It's not in fact the sound of the band giving up their influences; on the contrary, it shows them accepting new influences while also returning to their roots. 'Little Creatures' is a return to the core four-member band, and it puts much more focus than before on the band's instrumental prowess and on Byrne's songwriting than on orchestration and production. On the other hand, it's also much more melodic than anything they've done before V and from that comes the misconception that it was commercial and 'pop' V and with the experience and maturity they've gained over their years with Eno, 'Little Creatures' is much more focused and intelligible than their early singles or 'Talking Heads '77'. <br /> <br />The focus of 'Little Creatures' is on the songs themselves V and they're all gems. Certainly more optimistic and bouncy than anything they've done before V Byrne is no longer dying to show the world how pissed off he is V the songs are still filled with Byrne's witty and sarcastic sense of humor, though the sarcasm is much more subtle than before. 'Television Man' and 'Give Me Back My Name' are songs that perhaps have more of the earlier Heads in them, but 'And She Was' is a perfect love song, and it's a joy, from the wonderful kick that starts off the song and the album. 'Creatures of Love', 'Walk It Down' and 'The Lady Don't Mind' are all gorgeous tunes with lovely lyrics courtesy of Mr. Byrne, and can be described only as intelligent pop V pop by definition but not by essence, as it's all melodic and cheerful, and yet far too intricate and subtle to ever truly become radio hits. 'Stay Up Late' V ironically, the only song on the album that ever got any real airtime V is the meanest and most sarcastic tune on the album, but like the others, it's all with a smile and a wink. 'Road to Nowhere' is the track that closes the album and is arguably the best V and also one of the best tracks the Heads have ever put out. It's a masterpiece from beginning to end, and like the rest of the album, it shows the Heads for the brilliant musicians they are better than any other of their albums, save maybe 'True Stories'. <br /> <br />It's easy to see why the Talking Heads' most fanatic fans might scoff at 'Little Creatures', but it's an inseparable part of their work and one of their best albums, that should not be missed. It might also be their most accessible, and I would recommend it for anyone who's after some good music V though I'd still suggest starting your Heads experience with the more intricate sounds of 'Stop Making Sense', which is a truly irresistible experience. The Heads' work can easily be divided into three parts V the first is represented by 'The Name of This Band is Talking Heads', now finally available on CD; the second, by 'Stop Making Sense'. 'Little Creatures' is the third, and you would be wise to give it a chance, or more than one.
B000001EEN|5.0|The Rainbow concert is with out any shadow of a doubt the all time best live Eric Clapton album. Clapton has made quite a few of them and they are all for the most part good but this one is by far the best. If all the live albums and times I myself have seen the man live he never sounded more energetic or played better or sang better for that matter then on this record. This was the legendary concert Eric Clapton and Peter Townshend of The Who put on together back in 1973, this is like to Eric Clapton what At Filmour East is to The Allman Brothers Band.<br /><br />Erics playing here is phenomninal. He takes what you hear on the albums and takes it to a whole nother land, or world better yet. His leads are sharp and powerfull, his guitar solos could melt amps. Well not really but that would be cool though wouldnt it? Occasionly Claptons goes off on a totaly rendom solo thats not in the song and it is absolutly amazing. It shows what a true musician he is being able to free style and improve with his guitar, for example his playing here on his version of 'Little Wing' is one of the most amazing things I have ever heard some one do with a guitar. One thing that can be bad about live albums is sometimes the artist will go off into their own world and it can get boring but not here, never with Clapton. This is the best you will ever hear Eric Clapton play on record, Im telling you. Aside from Eric Claptons amazing guitar playing his  voice sounds really great here. It's nice gritty and sounds just like the records with you rarley here on live records. Besides Clapton his back up band was also chosen wisely because they sound great here.<br /><br />The problem with most live albums is that you get a couple good songs and some filler or covers that arent really that good, but the artist put them on because he liked them. Which is fine but on this record all the songs are classics. This are all concederd among Claptons all time best songs. You get Cream, Derek And The Dominos, and Solo tracks here and its great. Of all the songs on the album 'Tell The Truth' is the best, it is done perfectly and the guitar on the album version is amazing but this version blows it away, you wount find a better version of 'Tell The Truth' anywhere else.<br /><br />So if your out there looking for a good live Eric Clapton album that will showcase his guitar playing then this is the one for you. If your just looking for a good live album with lots of good songs played really well by Clapton then you wount find a bettter one then The Rainbow Concert!ominos, and Solo tracks here and its great. Of all the songs on the album 'Tell The Truth' is the best, it is done perfectly and the guitar on the album version is amazing but this version blows it away, you wount find a better version of 'Tell The Truth' anywhere else. <br /> <br />So if your out there looking for a good live Eric Clapton album that will showcase his guitar playing then this is the one for you.

B000B2YQX4|4.0|\\"Playing the Angel\\" is the eleventh studio album by synth legends Depeche Mode (and the third the band has released as a trio).  This isn't a CD you review on the first listen.  I've already listened to it 4 times on my iPod, and each experience revealed some detail I didn't catch before.  True to the trio's formula, \\"Playing the Angel\\" is chock full of religious themes, tales of angst, and spiritual decadence.  Under Ben Hiller's production, Martin Gore, Andy Fletcher, and Dave Gahan offer more of the same, but with a few interesting surprises and twists.  The kickoff single \\"Precious\\" (already a Top Five UK hit), is classic Mode: synth bleeps, a pulsating beat, and Gahan's expressively deep voice.  \\"John the Revelator\\" is \\"Personal Jesus Redux\\" with its aggressive, mangled guitar, and Gore (an underrated vocalist) takes over singing duties on the dark and brooding \\"Macro.\\"  Even the lovely 2 minute instrumental \\"Introspectre\\" is a standout.  But unlike previous DM albums, where Gore writes all the songs, Gahan steps in and contributes three of his own; the best of which is the chilled \\"I Want it All.\\"  Apparently, Gahan developed the songwriting itch after the release of his 2003 solo debut \\"Paper Monsters,\\" and while he's not quite as experienced as Gore, he shows some potential.  Though minimally flawed, \\"Playing the Angel\\" is a respectable comeback that's worth the four-and-a-half year wait.

0375707972|5.0|\\"The Reader\\" is a haunting work of fiction and a political allegory, as well. To appreciate the story, you need to understand the author's intent: to delve into the wounded post-war German soul and extricate the pain and guilt that is harbored there. The protagonists are not merely characters in an ill-fated romance; they are the embodiment of the German archetypes of obsession with absolute power, and slavish acquiescence to those who pursue and exercise that power. At every turn, the story reveals ethical and moral dilemmas that the characters have difficulty navigating; the search for truth leads them to difficult - and different - conclusions about what is required of them. This is a fascinating book that will intrique anyone with an interest in the history of WWII, philosophy, German culture, or the Holocaust. I recommend it for readers who are looking for a challenging experience with a work of literature. You won't be disappointed.

B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) lives in a working-class village in northern England, where his father and brother, both miners, have been on strike and times are tough.  Billy, who is eleven, loves music so much that he leaves his boxing class at the local gym and joins the girls' ballet class, taught by Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters).  With a lot of practice, Billy becomes so good that she thinks he should audition for the Royal Ballet School in London.  This would be the chance of a lifetime, but Billy's father doesn't know he's been dancing; he thinks ballet is for just for girls.<br /><br />I love this movie.  It is charming, honest, and uplifting.  Gary Lewis is wonderful as Billy's father.  We see him change from a bitter, defeated man to a proud and happy dad.  Julie Walters gives a heartfelt performance as the tough teacher with a heart of gold.  Jamie Bell, in his movie debut, is natural and sweet, a good dancer, and a sensitive actor.  This is a movie you'll want to watch more than once, because it's that good.<br /><br />Kona
B000000OQF|5.0|Being considered as a Guns N' Roses fan, I'd rather say that I'm more like a Slash fan. However I have to admit that \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" is one of the classics. After nearly 20 years, I'm still listening to it from time to time. I'm still playing some of their songs on my Les Paul. I've always been considering Slash as one of the guitar legends in the world. His solos are strong and powerful, such as those in \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", \\"Rocket Queen\\", \\"November Rain\\", \\"Don't Cry\\", etc. (Yes, I know the last two songs are not in \\"Appetite for Destruction\\".) So if you are new to Guns N' Roses, I would like to suggest you get \\"Greatest Hits\\" which includes some really good songs from \\"Use Your Illusion\\" I/II.  <br /> <br />When someone said something like \\"Slash is not good at guitars at all\\" or \\"Sweet Child O' Mine sounds like a circus theme song\\", I figured they absolutely know nothing about rock music and guitar playing. I just don't quite understand why they waste their time on reviewing some pieces of art that they totally have no idea about. <br /> <br />All in all, Guns N' Roses was one of the greatest rock bands ever. Honestly, after Slash left GNR, I never believed that Snakepit and Velvet Revolver would be as successful as GNR, and it did sadly turn out to be the truth. But whatsoever, we still can never ever deny the fact that Slash is one of the most talented guitarists in the Rock N' Roll history.

B0009MDPYM|4.0|I have no familiarity whatsoever with the graphic novel upon which this film is based, so I can only address the film in and of itself.  And I must say that I rather enjoyed it for the most part.  Anything with angels and demons always interests me, and this film put a quirky spin on the agents of God and Lucifer.  Since John Constantine seems to be a pretty tight-lipped fellow who doesn't reveal much of himself to anyone, Keanu Reeves seems like a pretty good pick to play the part - there's not too much acting required for this one.<br /><br />So what's this all about?  Well, John Constantine has this gift (or curse) to see and interact with creatures from both heaven and hell; he's already been to hell and back once - literally - and therein lies his biggest problem.  Since he did commit suicide, he's not eligible for a ticket to heaven later on - and this second life he was given is hurtling toward an impending end thanks to all those cigarettes he's chain-smoked for years.  He's content to go his own moping way, dealing with particularly difficult exorcisms when called upon and generally just bemoaning his awful fate.  Then a female cop (Rachel Weisz) shows up asking for his help; her sister supposedly committed suicide, but she doesn't believe it.  Both Rachel and her sister were pretty special, for they could also see the things Constantine sees (although it takes some rather intense training for Constantine to reawaken those abilities in his new, temporary partner).  It soon seems obvious that something big is going down.  More and more demons are trying to cross into our world, violating a big treaty between God and Lucifer (who would have thought that demons couldn't be trusted?), and that just doesn't bode well for anybody.  Before you know it, special effects are coming at you left and right, and the birth of the Antichrist is almost at hand.<br /><br />Now, you're probably thinking that old Mr. Pitchfork himself is behind the whole Antichrist thing - but that ain't necessarily so.  The movie manages to throw in a couple of small surprises toward the end (although it certainly breaks no new ground in showing Lucifer as a really stupid being).  I really hated the characterization of the angel Gabriel, though.  First off, I just don't see Gabriel as a woman, but more importantly, this Gabriel comes across as a far from superior being.  This isn't the first time we've seen a Gabriel who hated and conspired against humans (out of jealousy), but Constantine's Gabriel is a far cry from a similar archangel in, for example, The Prophecy.<br /><br />The plot of this movie isn't all that bad, but it could have been told much more effectively.  If you're not into this kind of weird subject matter, you may look upon the story as little more than an excuse to throw some impressive special effects together.  I'm giving Constantine a somewhat tentative four stars, but I'm sure there are a good many people who won't enjoy the film very much at all.- but that ain't necessarily so.

B00009UW0N|5.0|PLOT:  The film begins in Haddonfield, Illinois on Halloween night, October 31st, 1963. 6-year-old Michael Myers (dressed in a clown costume) has killed his 16-year-old sister with a kitchen knife. The young boy is declared to be insane and sentenced to a mental institution. The film then jumps to 15 years later at the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is driving with his nurse to the mental hospital on a rainy night on Ocober 30th, 1978. Loomis is determined to make sure that Micael Myers (now 21) will never get out of the institution alive. Once there, Loomis notices several of the patients wandering around outside. He gets out to investigate and his nurse is suddenly scared by a patient trying to get in the car. She jumps out and the patient jumps in the car and drives off. It turns out that this patient was Michael Myers. Now that he's escaped, who knows where he will go. Loomis feels that Myers may be returning to Haddonfield, so he quickly embarks on a mission to find him before he kills anyone. The next day in Haddonfield, 18-year-old Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is on her way to school. During the day, she looks outside the window and notices a strange man in a mechanics jumpsuit and a white face mask. After school, she walks home with her friends Annie (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda (PJ Soles). Throughout the day, she continues to see the masked man around town, but only short glimpses. She wonders who the man is, and if he is following her. Loomis gets to Haddonfield and quickly warns Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers), about Michael Myers. Brackett isn't too alarmed and feels that the chances of Myers coming back to Haddonfield on Halloween are minimal. Loomis warns Brackett that if something isn't done quick then there are going to be some grisly murders.<br /><br />COMMENTS:  I would consider John Carpenter's classic to be one of the Top 5 scariest horror films of all time. At the time, John Carpenter was just a low-budget filmmaker with only two films under his belt: \\"Dark Star\\" (1974) and \\"Assault On Precinct 13\\" (1976). He and his girlfriend at the time, producer Debra Hill, both wrote the screenplay together. Carpenter claimed that he would be able to film the movie for a small budget of $300,000. His first task was casting the role of Dr. Loomis. His first two choices were Britain's famous horror duo: Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Both of them turned him down (Lee later admitted that it was the biggest mistake of his career.) Carpenter finally (and fortunately) cast veteran actor Donald Pleasance in the role. It became his most memorable role ever. He next cast new-comer Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. He felt this was good karma, since Curtis's mom was actress Janet Leigh of \\"Psycho\\" (1960) fame. The film also featured a very unique soundtrack and theme song, which Carpenter composed himself. Halloween ultimately became a huge success and sent Carpenter and Curtis into stardom. Even Donald Pleasance found a new audience for himself. Carpenter went on to direct other films like \\"The Fog\\" (1980), \\"Escape From New York\\" (1981), and \\"The Thing\\" (1982). Jamie Lee Curtis became somewhat of a scream queen in films like Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\", \\"Prom Night\\" (1980), and \\"Terror Train\\" (1980). She later broke into bigger roles like in \\"Trading Places\\" (1983) and \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" (1988). Halloween was the start of a long friendship between Carpenter and Pleasance, and the two made films together for many years afterwards. Halloween ultimately spawned one of the screen's most infamous boogey men (Michael Myers) and 7 sequels: \\"Halloween II\\" (1981), \\"Halloween III: Season Of The Witch\\" (1982) [unrelated sequel], \\"Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers\\" (1988), \\"Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Michael Myers\\" (1989), Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers\\" (1995), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later\\" (1998), and Halloween: Resurrection\\" (2002). Curtis reprised her role of Laurie Strode for Halloween's 2, 7, and 8. Pleasance reprised his role of Dr. Loomis for every sequel (except the unrelated Halloween III) up to Halloween 6. If he hadn't have died in 1995, he would have gone up to Halloween 22. This awesome 25th Anniversary edition DVD contains the film presented in the original theatrical widescreen ratio. It also features an 87-minute documentary on the making of the film, an \\"On Location - 25 Years Later\\" documentary, TV spots, radio spots, theatrical trailer, photo and poster gallery, talent bios, and a commentary with John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Debra Hill.Halloween's 2, 7, and 8.

B00005JNY4|5.0|Unlike other films adrift in a Hollywood ocean, overpowered by the ever-looming 'Titanic' success of James Cameron's 1997 surprise iceberg hit, finally comes a film for it to reckon with of a far superior nature, and in a class of its very own. Contrary to first shallow impressions, 'Into The Blue' will plunge you into a watery vortex and leave you to reel and revel in a film that holds more depth and promise just below the waters surface. Within seconds 'Into The Blue' will unleash a power so strong it will leave a ripple effect in its wake, to jolt chip manufactures from their sleep, and surf producers riding on the creast of a Rip Curl wave, certain to cast viewers back in their seat and take you on a journey that is as course as a diamond in the rough, and as precious as movies come, with a refreshing burst of originality, breathing new life into unexplored sand dunes, and inviting travelers to appealing new vistas. It is in this film that all our hopes lie.<br /><br />From it's very first frame 'Into The Blue' lights up the screen with tremendous force, and creates palpable electricity that surges with such adept accuracy, that Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer could never single-handedly harness in all their years of collaboration. Lightening has stuck the water and what it has captured in its intermittent flash along the sky, is a plane mid flight, that will steer it on a steep trajectory to a watery grave. 'Into The Blue' may strike anyone dead without warning. It will happen out of the blue and blow any previous film that has ventured here out of the water.<br /><br />Where director John Stockwell's 'Blue Crush' stands alone about the ferocity of waves on a surfer's life. In this and previous films, John Stockwell has never lost his unique flare for telling hard-hitting stories that matter. He also shows a love for practicality in terms of locations, and a real eye for unsurpassed teenage angst and human drama, unmatched from anyone else in the movie spectrum. 'Into The Blue' sees John return to the water to prospect the vast depts of ocean below us. He does this with such skill the likes of which Steven Speilberg's 'Jaws', could never get its teeth around. 'Into The Blue' will take four friends and lull them like a musical box into a false sense of security, as they unlock the hidden mystery of the previously mentioned downed aircraft. There is no map to guide this film, and no dock to harbour your inner most fears and desires. No S.O.S. call or messages in a bottle to the police or ABBA to save you. Once you gleem what lurks within the shadows, only a single beam of light can offer any underwater explorer hope, that will do little to help seperate you from the darkness that penetrates through the blackness of night within an ocean of activity. However, no mediums or crystal balls will see you into the future and save you from the lure of buried treasure, and the feelings it will dredge up within you. The results could only leave you with an icy chill. When you have to barter for your life, and are given no other choice but to accept cold hard cash to fulfill a promise to shady clientele, that will either leave you riding high on the cusp of a wave, or tip you over the edge into the deep end, like you've been forced to walk the plank of a pirate ship, and your only hope for survival is to become ruthless in your resolve to cull every last adversary with any sharp arsenal at your disposal. Tranquil waters will stir and all hell will break loose below deck if you don't play your cards right and hold your breath. All bets will be off and you'll have to pay the ultimate price if you want to escape with your life. Get immersed as you dive 'Into The Blue', or drown your sorrows as your dreams are snuffed and the water takes your life and you are swept away. Where your body will never reach the shore again, and you wont be given a chance to say any final words and all hopes of survival will sink like a stone.movie spectrum.

B000006V31|5.0|A friend turned me on to this band and when I listened to it the first time through, the singer reminded me of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden. Not a big fan of Alternative, I was not sure I liked Leaf Hound.<br /><br />However, upon second listen, I got used to the singer and though a bit much a times, he fits the music perfectly! To my ears they are definitely in the stoner rock mold. At times they remind me of Lucifer's Friend, except the keyboards are not really there. There is also the vague Black Sabbath flavor to it. The riffing is good, and the general guitar work is a real kick!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000777J2S|1.0|I agree that Antony's voice is haunting.  It still haunts my nightmares even long after I stopped listening.   <br /> <br />I agree that Antony's voice has a flutelike quality, I just cannot stand the sound of a flute unable to stay on key. <br />When I first heard it, I wondered how anyone could have become popular when they did not even know how to sing in tune.  Then I realized that it was not unintentional.  I then wondered what would possess someone to sound like that on purpose. <br /> <br />I watched him on Dave Letterman and the only thing more distracting than his warbling was his movements while singing and playing.  Knowing that he was on a late-night comedian's show, I kept waiting for the punchline.   <br /> <br />When that did not happen, I started trying to listen to the lyrics.  I had difficulty understanding exactly what he was saying.  I thought maybe he did not speak English and was just making the sounds he thought were correct for the words. <br /> <br />I immediately got on the computer and looked him up.  After seeing so many good reviews, I thought that he must have just been especially nervous or maybe in a gag before he came out, Letterman had kneed him in the balls, and that was the best he could do in the circumstances. <br /> <br />I listened to some more of his music online.  I can only thank my lucky stars that I am too cheap to shell out for decent speakers for my computer so I did not have to listen to it loudly. <br /> <br />When reviewers say that they did not like the album at first, but it grew on them, or they advise people that they will like it more after listening to it a few times, they must have developed a tolerance to the noise.  Either that or they were too afraid to be original and go against the people who are too caught up in protesting anything mainstream to acknowledge that sometimes music is not in the mainstream because it sucks. <br /> <br />When a fan blames a bad review on the subject matter and essentially labels anyone who does not like this CD to be a homophobe, or uncomfortable with transgender issues, they are oversimplifying the matter.  I have no problem with different lifestyles.  I do have a problem being accused of being close minded because I find the music, words and lead singer to be utterly unlistenable. <br /> <br />The musicians were wonderful.  They did a fantastic job playing with the ebb and flow of the song.  I could listen to their playing all day long, provided I did not have to ever see or hear Antony again. <br /> <br />If you actually like this album, I am glad that you have found something that touches you.  To me, it is like fingernails on a chalkboard that makes me want to claw out my ears.
0140143505|1.0|I don't quite know what I was expecting when I checked out this book. I knew that everyone on earth I know who has read it claims that it is perfect for Anglophiles and Bibliophiles. Since I am both, I figured I would love this slim volume of correspondence between a bookseller and a New York freelance writer. It was, sad to say, forgettable. Charming - sure. Sad - of course. A great read - not so much. The letters are short. Not like the wonderful letters of, say Jane Austen or Virginia Woolf and other authors. They were short \\"send me this book\\" with witty ways of wording thank-yous. I didn't get a feel for either person. Additionally, the blurb on the back states that this book is the collected 20 year correspondence. True, but its like 3 letters a year and most of them - like I stated earlier - orders and thank you responses.  <br />

B000AL730O|5.0|The songs are truly great--musically unpredictable, polished and satisfying.  <br /> <br />One way you know this is a different sort of album is that when you listen to the songs, you can say to yourself--hey, this is really the same guy that wrote For No One, Eleanor Rigby, Blackbird and Let It Be (among a much longer list of great songs). He does musical stuff here that bands like XTC have been trying to capture for years.  <br /> <br />The coolest thing about these songs is that they're really \\"finished\\" works--not vaguely interesting throwaways or simple beginnings of good songs ruined by clicheed structures or lack-lustre production (like, honestly, at least three quarters of McC's solo stuff).  <br /> <br />The excellent production helps the sense of completion, too: listen to this with headphones--or loud on a good system--for full effect.  <br /> <br />Yes, the whole thing is less rock-oriented than a lot of his other albums or Beatles songs--there's no Back in the USSR or Helter Skelter here. There are still a couple of great up-tempo songs here though.  <br /> <br />But more importantly, McCartney has re-claimed his own legacy in terms of song structure complexity and overall honesty of musical purpose. That's something some of us have been waiting for since, well, the end of the Beatles themselves.  <br /> <br />
0141301104|4.0|Dahl's tale about a 7-year-old boy and his fearless cigar-smoking granny is a delightful October read--light-hearted, cleverly plotted, and fast-paced with plenty of dialogue. <br />Suddenly an orphan at the tender age of 7, the unnamed protagonist is sent to live with his beloved grandmother in Norway--a country he knows from summer vacations, but more importantly--a country which understands the Supernatural.  His grandmother proves a walking encyclopedia of witch lore as she warns him in great detail in an effort to keep him safe from this global threat.  At first skeptical, he soon realizes that there truly Are witches, disguised as humans, everywhere.  And worst of all--that no child is safe from their wrath. <br /> <br />    Required by terms of his parents' will to live in England, they set up house there, but the boy has an encounter with a real witch, causing his granny great concern.  While recuperating from pneumonia at a seaside resort, she is informed of a most dangerous situation: the annual convention of English witches is taking place in the same hotel!  Mistakenly hidden behind a screen in the conference room, the boy overhears horrendous plans to wipe out all English children in one diabolical stroke.  But how can a little boy and even his wise granny foil the schemes of the High Witch?  With its implication that smoking is harmful to one's health, this tale endears readers by the close relationship between the boy and his granny, who loves him unconditionally and will do everything to protect him. Cute and captivating WITCHES is a delightful read for kids of all ages! <br />  <br />
B000002KHH|5.0|If you truly love metal, Paranoid, or any Black Sabbath for that matter, will wind up in your collection.  It is essential.  I think it is safe to say that Black Sabbath was the first really Heavy Metal band.  Sure Led Zeppelin had their influences upon many, but it was Sabbath that really holds the torch high, above any band.  The Big Granddaddy of them all, when Black Sabbath released Paranoid, it stayed on the charts for years.  Every song is classic material.  I really can't think of a bad track, except maybe Planet Caravan, because it seems more like a \\"mood\\" song.  If you are in that particular \\"Mood\\" it can become one of the best songs on the planet.  These moments can easily occur when one is in a room filled with incense.  Other songs like the classic Paranoid and War Pigs are timeless.  Sure the song Iron Man is overplayed to no end, but the solos contained within are filed with such energy that this song will never die.  It's like Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple, it's here to stay.  One of my favorite parts has to be the drum solo in the instrumental titled Rat Salad.  Toni Iommi fascinates me to no end throughout the album.  Geezer's bass is clearly heard.  Bill Ward is a fanatic on the drums and deserves to be idolized.  And let's not forget Ozzy's classic original vocals.  Notice how no one every tried to copy him?  This was back when Ozzy was God, classic Sabbath was with Ozzy and Ozzy's solo career is nothing in comparison.  Paranoid is timeless, and like all classic Sabbath records, will never be destroyed or forgotten.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|I LOVE LOVE this album!  I LOVE Alicia's first two albums and I have seen her live 3 times!  The Unplugged is so amazing because she is a true entertainer, all around.  She is real, from the heart, and so talented.  She's a gem!  I love this album because she sounds amazing live and now I can hear her anytime.  She is not what the mainstream pop so-called \\"singers/songwriters\\" are doing these days.  Hardly anyone out there could arrange and sing these songs as she does so incredibly soulful.  Not only is she beautiful on the outside she is very humble and tries to connect with her audience.  Any true Alicia fan or anyone who appreciates genuine talent will LOVE this album!!!
B000000WJK|4.0|Before their huge breakthrough album, \\"Urban Hymns\\" (named best album of the year by Rolling Stone Magazine), with its smash hit, \\"Bittersweet Sympathy\\" (whch \\"borrowed\\" from a symphonic version of \\"The Last Time\\" by the Rolling Stones), Verve released its fine debut, \\"A Storm in Heaven.\\"  While I don't think \\"Storm\\" quite matches the power of \\"Urban Hymns,\\" Verve certainly demonstrated that they had a unique voice, sort of like a soundscape version of the shoegazer sound, perhaps a mellower version of Catherine Wheel.  (I don't quite agree with some other reviewers' comparisons to Pink Floyd). <br /> <br />Right from the opening note of \\"Star Sail,\\" you know you're hearing something special, as the lush textures created by guitarist Nick McCabe wash over the listener (Richard Ashcroft would later dominate the band, which might help to explain the breakup of Verve after only three albums).  Next comes the only song that received some radio play, \\"Slide Away,\\" (\\"but just for today/ let go and slide away\\") one of my favorite songs on \\"Storm.\\" <br /> <br />The album's goal is certainly to transport the listener to a more peaceful and transcendent place, and it most definitely accomplishes this.  My favorite songs though (other than \\"Slide Away\\") are the ones that rock a little bit, namely \\"The Sun, The Sea\\" and \\"Blue.\\"  \\"Butterfly\\" is interesting, but about two minutes too long.  The other songs are somewhat interchangeable, but all quite good.  I really appreciate the intermittent, and often unexpected, inclusion of horns, piano, and/or flute on several tracks (with the always present reverb guitar). <br /> <br />I highly recommend \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" in its own right, but also to experience what the band did before \\"Urban Hymns.\\"
0060872675|5.0|I LOVED this story!  It was cute and endearing and one I could read over and over again.  I don't have children; (I read it in the store when I bought \\"Going Postal\\") but if I had kids, I would definitely buy this book to read to them.  What a great way to introduce kids to the Discworld.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|HA HA HA  M. shadows can't scream anymore hahahaa man he sounds sooo bad doing jus clean vocals. jesus does he suck. <br /> <br />anyways moving on, this band can totally copies 80's hair metal style riffs with a large dose of today's metal core. this is a band that would even make Vince Neal cringe. <br /> <br />the music now is soo cheesy sounding and crappy that i would rather headbang to my phones ringtones. i totally think that M. shadows not being able to scream anymore hindered this bands sound therefore making it ten times more cheesier. <br /> <br />there are some points where there's little cool double guitars dueling, but if u want to listen to that, jus listen to the masters who originated it, IRON MAIDEN. <br /> <br />these guys claim they were inlfuence by bands such as Metallica but im sorry dudes u are not even as brutal as Metallica....ouch <br /> <br />dont buy this jus because its a trend to listen to these guys, if you already havnt done so, get their old stuff
B00009AOBI|5.0|This has got to be one of the most heartwreching and inspirational movies I've seen. <br /> <br />First of all, I love Based on a True Story movies because I just find them interesting. Such movies like this one, Donnie Brasco and many, many others.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this movie is something everybody should see before they die. One thing that I was very impressed with, is the fact that this guy has a very horrible difurging (&lt;---spell check) disease and he has a very upbeat personality.  <br /> <br />I got out of that, nobody what happens to us in life, you can always keep a smile on your face.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|YAYYYYYY!!!! Cryptopsy's back!!!!!!!! and even better now. man after seeing them play with suffocation i knew they were gunna play some of their new stuff....and man i was eager to buy Once Was Not. <br /> <br />Fnally going to the more old school approach (thank god) not many bands do this. but man did they get more technical. its almost like death math metal but im not complaining. <br /> <br />The only thing that kinda catches your ear is how loud the drums are recorded, they do in fact kinda drown out the others but its nothing too excessive and wont really bug you. besides, its freaking Flo behind the kit, u cant really complain. <br /> <br />this is Cryptopsy's new release with their original and best vocalist LORD WORM. man the dudes already pushing 40 and can still perform insanely well. he even eats a cup full of worms on stage (hence the name \\"lord worm\\") <br /> <br />these guys have totally gotten better and sounds like they mixed Blasphemy and None So Vile together and sounds brutal as hell. <br /> <br />anyways get this now if you love cryptopsy its a must own!! also check out Flo Mounier's drum lesson video!!
B000002BBY|5.0|Do your research before you type and make a complete fool of yourself. The gallagher brothers are very talented and i do agree that their music is inspired by the beatles, but every band is always inspired by previous and you can tell by the way they make their music. The same applies to the beatles, but the difference is that they doing it to a new generation of fans. Think about it, i wasn't a big fan of the beatles until I listened to oasis. Their music has opened the door to other bands such as the Who, rolling stones, stone roses, etc. The band at the moment is healthy as it has ever been, everyone is contributing to the band in terms of songwriting and their live performances are fantastic. I believe at the moment they are probably the best band in the world in terms of their current album and how they are supporting the album in terms of the live performance. By the way, WSTM is an absolute classic and I still listen to the album almost everyday. One more thing DONNA, you are suppose to review the album and not to personally critise the band members. Try to get a life if can babe. Peace Out.
B000AL730Y|5.0|[...]<br />I think that \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" is not only the most satisfying album in McCartney's post-Beatles career, I think it may rank, for me, as the best solo Beatle record of all.<br />Now, I'm not saying that his \\"best\\" songs are on this record (whatever \\"best\\" really means), but I am saying that in terms of overall seriousness and cohesiveness, this is McCartney's greatest achievement. Unlike his past efforts, I hear no duds here. Sure, as expected, there are reasons to be critical: \\"A Certain Softness\\" has a melodic waywardness that doesn't quite work. But I don't dislike the song. Another song: \\"This Never Happened Before\\" has a melody that veers too close into MOR territory (but the \\"Abbey Road\\"-like sound world that opens the song sends chills through me). But, again, I don't dislike the song. That my criticisms of his new album are so mild says a lot because all his past efforts are marred by weak, tossed off and sometimes downright awful songs. I won't list them here.<br />\\"Band on the Run\\"? That album might come in second. It has a number of great songs on it and there's some real energy and enthusiasm there, but unlike the new one, that album doesn't sound like a Beatles record to me.<br />Yes, \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" is the first long-player I've heard from John Paul, George or Ringo that sounds like a Beatles record -- but one in which Paul happens to sing all the leads. There's a surprising amount of Lennon-like near-bitterness to many of the lyrics. As for the music, I hear Lennonesque things all throughout the record. \\"At the Mercy\\" definitely has some Lennon-like gestures, and certainly much of the music calls to mind \\"Revolver\\"-era Lennon. And \\"Follow Me\\" sounds to me like an almost outright Lennon & McCartney collaboration (with an imaginary Lennon coming to Paul with a shard of an \\"Across the Universe\\"-like song to finish up). And \\"Friends to Go\\", one of McCartney's greatest songs ever from any period of his career, sounds, as McCartney mentions in the accompanying DVD, a bit like a George Harrison song. And then there's \\"Jenny Wren\\". That instant classic sounds like a lost treasure from the \\"White\\" album.<br />Another thing. This new record represents his third time doing a relatively \\"all-Paul\\" album, and to my ears it's far and away the best of the three. The problem with 1970's \\"McCartney\\" is, basically, that much of it sounds too tossed off. And \\"McCartney II\\" is a largely dull and uninspired affair that includes the deadly \\"Coming Up\\".<br />As for other McCartney long-player contenders, \\"Tug of War\\" is okay; it has some good songs, some bad songs, but it's just another one of McCartney's too smooth- and \\"safe\\"-sounding and unadventurous albums (\\"Pipes of Peace\\" was worse). \\"London Town\\"? Sure, that's one of his better records -- but it doesn't sound like a Beatles record to me.<br />That's it for now. I suppose the only \\"evidence\\" I have in support of my thesis is that McCartney said that working with Nigel Godrich was like working with John Lennon.<br />Barry<br />PS\\" My favorite song from the record? Probably \\"Too Much Rain\\".
B00006FM77|5.0|This CD is a fantastic piece of work that captures Chicago at the height of their glory in the early days. I got the original 4-record set for Christmas 1971 and it was about all I played for several months. <br /> <br />My personal favorite is the \\"Song for Richard and His Friends/25 or 6 to 4/I'm A Man\\" sequence on Volume Three. You can just feel the energy in Carnegie Hall when you know the guys are coming out for encores. I had the privilege of seeing them in concert three times in the mid 1970's, all fortunately before Terry Kath's death. Back then their standard encore was \\"Feeling Stronger Every Day\\". It must have been incredible to be in Carnegie Hall when they struck up \\"I'm A Man\\". <br /> <br />The stuff on Volume Four is really good stuff too. A lot of good stuff on Chicago III that was not on the original 1971 release is on Volume Four - in particular, the \\"Hour in the Shower\\" medley is great. <br /> <br />What musical geniuses these guys were! It is just a thrill to have this CD and enjoy listening to them all over again. If you grew up listening to Chicago back in the early 70s, you've got to have this one!
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This review is for the \\"Batman Anthology\\" set, where each movie is packaged in a new, 2-disc special edition. There is also an older, \\"Batman Legacy\\" set with the bare-bones editions, and Amazon seems to be grouping the two reviews together.<br /><br />It's about time that Warner Home Video has finally given these superhero films the two disc, special-edition treatment they deserve. Each film comes with restored/enhanced video and audio, and all the special features one expects from a current dvd release these days; we get commentaries, archival music videos and trailers, making-of featurettes, interviews, retrospectives, and deleted scenes. The last bit will be of special interest to some fans, especially because the Batman Forever DVD finally includes those missing sequences we saw in the storybooks and trading cards (though they appear here in rough form). Also of interest to fans of the animated series is the abandoned \\"Robin sequence\\" from the original movie, where they got Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil to bring the storyboards to life. Overall the special features are excellent, and these special editions are not a cheap double-dip.<br /><br />The big question is if you should shell out for the box set, which includes the generally reviled \\"Batman and Robin.\\" Personally I completely love the first three movies, and since the box set is about the price of buying them seperately or even cheaper, I'd say go for it. The Batman and Robin edition has enough special features to be worth the investment, and besides that the complete box set just looks nicer on my shelf. If you only like two of the four movies, it's a harder decision. If you can guarantee to yourself that you'll never be tempted to pick up more than two of the films, grab them individually. But if you're a collector who might eventually cave-in and get the others for completion's sake, the best bet is to buy the box set now.<br /><br />Either way, it's nice to finally own these films with all the trimmings.rimmings.
0452285186|5.0|This book is great!  Not for everyone because of it's simplistic and slightly sadistic humor, but I found it very funny.  We all laughted and of course picked out our favorite \\"suicides\\".  This book can easily be read in a few minutes so it won't keep you occupied for long, but revisiting it every now and then will bring back the laughs.  The best thing about it is showing it to people that have never seen it before.  Good times.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|Eric the Singer takes precedence over Clapton the Magician Guitarist and what you get is an extremely ordinary set of songs thar eminently forgettable. Sorry Eric, but the intensity that \\"Blackie\\" had is entirely missing from this new album.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I happen to like the Exciter album. But Playing the Angel is better. More my style, and more of what I like about Depeche Mode. Some here have said that Precious is the best song on this record and I'd have to disagree. One of the best? Yes. But tracks like a pain that I'm used to, suffer well, the sinner in me, and nothings impossible are songs that have to be considered for that honor. Some good, dark, moody, electronic music. Check it out if your into that kind of thing!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I've been listening to Dm since 1981. I never cared for SOFAD, Ultra, Exciter, although I liked songs from each album. I think DM is back. And if you're still waiting for Alan Wilder to come back, he's not missed on this record, that's my opinion. A Pain that I'm used to, John the revelator, Suffer well, precious, the sinner in me, I want it all, nothing's impossible - make this a great album. This is a solid 4 stars record.
B000B0WO0I|5.0|I can't believe I'm the first to review this wonderful new CD by the incredible Simply Red!  Only in my dreams can I sing as good as Mick.  This is a great new album of some new, some old.  Everything sounds clean and refreshed and better the second time around.  This guy has survived the 80's, the 90's and is doing better than ever before.  His voice is brilliant and sounds deeper and richer and is just plain \\"FIERCE\\", and I mean that in the best possible way too.  If you are a fan of Simply Red than this is a must have.  If you've never tried Simply Red before than this is the one to get you started.  Then go and try the beautiful \\"Home\\" CD, one of their best, you won't be sorry.

B00005LQ04|4.0|I enjoyed the purchase I made; everything I expected it to be and more.  The anniversary collection disc includes exclusive gifts inside pertaining to the movie.  What made it even worth more was the fact that the Goblin album, which is the soundtrack for the movie is included.  there is also a director's commentary I have no as of yet got a chance to watch.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Stockholm's most unpredictable metallic sons Opeth have offered another step on their dark journey into the Maelstrom that combines progressive sonics, and acoustic and electric instrumentation, all the while extrapolating on their now-trademark brand of death metal. stepping aside from the malevolent acoustic elegance of 2003's Damnation without abandoning the textural advances, Ghost Reveries is a tour de force of creativity, power, and innovation. alternately melodic and brutal, the album takes the band's progressive acumen to a new level while never abandoning the crunch. vocalist, guitarist, and lyricist Mikael Åkerfeldt has become a complete poet of the dark side. with bandmates Per Wiberg on keyboards, drummer Martin Lopez, guitarist Peter Lindgren, and bassist Martin Mendez,  Åkerfeldt has forged ahead into a vein of this music that moves it further forward while embracing not only elements of the band's foundational past, but also elements from the annals of heavy metal. the sheer, harsh, tragic beauty of Ghost Reveries reveals it as more a hunted album than a haunted one. the opener \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" is layered with heartbreakingly lyrical beauty -- amidst its crack and burn -- with vocals either sung poetically or growled from the depths of the ravages of the human throat: \\"In time the hissing of her sanity/Faded out her voice and soiled her name/And like marked pages in a diary/Everything seemed that is unstained/The incoherent talk of ordinary days/Why would we really need to live/Decide what is clear and what's within a haze/What you should take and what to give....\\" the guitars, electric and acoustic, intertwining and winding around one another with quick figures, move the melody into the labyrinthine \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest,\\" that goes on for over 11 minutes while its tales of sickness and tenderness rub against one another and become one tortured being. justification and easy moral judgments become futile, reflections of painful memory and dislocation are taut, walking a rusty razor wire as propulsive drums and crackling guitars carry the singer into his desolation. ultimately, Ghost Reveries comes together like a suite, characters have various faces and traits, but they are all reflections in a mirror that retains no permanent image. this album is a culmination of everything Opeth have worked toward throughout their career. it's fully realized, stunningly beautiful, and emotionally fragmented; it's a terrain where power, tenderness, and sheer grief hold forth under heavy manners. awesome.ocation are taut, walking a rusty razor wire as propulsive drums and crackling guitars carry the singer into his desolation. ultimately, Ghost Reveries comes together like a suite, characters have various faces and traits, but they are all reflections in a mirror that retains no permanent image. this album is a culmination of everything Opeth have worked toward throughout their career. it's fully realized, stunningly beautiful, and emotionally fragmented; it's a terrain where power, tenderness, and sheer grief hold forth under heavy manners. awesome.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This movie is an absolute masterpiece, a movie that will NEVER be made in America.  We ask for violence in our movies, but we want it to be quick and (psychologically) painless.  We want sex in our movies, but nothing more than \\"boobies\\" and simulated, under the blanket sex.  What makes this film so powerful is that it refuses to operate by these conventions--we've always been told that the rape scene in \\"The Accused\\" was harrowing and groundbreaking.  Frankly, it looks like an episode of \\"Sesame Street\\" compared to the rape scene in this movie.  Some will argue that I am depraved for wanting to see a realistic rape scene.  The fact is, the scene made me extremely uncomfortable--as a rape scene should.  Why should we get off easily when shown something as heinous as a rape?  I believe that the typical 10 second rape scenes trivialize the rape and make it devoid of the devastating consequences it should have upon the viewer's psyche.  I would also like to commend Gaspar Noe for showing real sex in his movies.  It's about time someone made a movie that proves you can have graphic sex without it being prurient.  Irreversible does for sex what Joyce's Ulysses did for sexuality in literature.  I can only hope that one day Americans will get over their Puritanical roots, because the Europeans, the Japanese and the South Koreans are humiliating us in the film department.
B000002LRX|5.0|Warner Bros. figured that lightning could strike twice at a time when oodles of (most horribly bad) funk-metal acts were following in Faith No More and Red Hot Chili Peppers's footsteps. in response, the former recorded and released the bizarro masterpiece Angel Dust. Patton's work in Mr. Bungle proved just how strange and inspired he could get given the opportunity; now, in his more famous act, nothing was ignored. \\"Land of Sunshine\\" starts things off in a vein similar to The Real Thing, but Patton's vocal role-playing is smarter and more accomplished, with the lyrics trashing a smug bastard with pure inspired mockery. from there, Angel Dust mixes the meta-metal of earlier days with the expected puree of other influences, including a cinematic sense of atmosphere. the album ends with a cover of John Barry's \\"Midnight Cowboy,\\" which suits the mood perfectly, but the stretched-out, tense moments on \\"Caffeine\\" and the soaring charge of \\"Everything's Ruined\\" make for other good examples. even a Kronos Quartet sample crops up on the frazzled sprawl of \\"Malpractice.\\" other sampling and studio treatments come to the fore throughout, adding quirks like the distorted voices on \\"Smaller and Smaller.\\" the band's sense of humor crops up frequently -- there's the hilarious portrayal of prepubescent angst on \\"Kindergarten,\\" made all the more entertaining by the music's straightforward approach, or the beyond-stereotypical white trash cornpone narration of \\"RV,\\" all while the music breezily swings along. Patton's voice is stronger and downright smooth at many points throughout, the musicians collectively still know their stuff, and the result is twisted entertainment at its finest.
B000002B7M|5.0|Ozzy created a perfect starting album for his successfull solo career. It is great music to listen to, and also takes a supreme amount of skill to play. Randy was one of my favorite guitarists, and his classical influencing works very well with the music, and still gives it a good hard feel.
B000002NIW|5.0|while the Deftones still rely more on form than content, they have noticeably improved on their second album, Around the Fur. their sound has hardened into a blunt, aggressive slab of metallic guitars and hammering drums, giving the album a visceral force. the Deftones tap into the same alternative metal vibe as Korn and L7, and while they don't have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, Around the Fur suggests they're about to come into their own.
B000002B7U|3.0|This was an album that is better than most rock and roll albums, but wasn't so good for Ozzy. He has had better records than this, like Blizzard of Ozz, or Diary of a Madman. Surprisingly, my favorite track \\"Lightning Strikes\\" is on this album.
B000002H33|5.0|even though Master of Puppets didn't take as gigantic a leap forward as Ride the Lightning, it was the band's greatest achievement, hailed as a masterpiece by critics far outside heavy metal's core audience. it was also a substantial hit, reaching the Top 30 and selling three million copies despite absolutely nonexistent airplay. instead of a radical reinvention, Master of Puppets is a refinement of past innovations. in fact, it's possible to compare Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets song for song and note striking similarities between corresponding track positions on each record (although Lightning's closing instrumental has been bumped up to next-to-last in Master's running order). that hint of conservatism is really the only conceivable flaw here. though it isn't as startling as Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets feels more unified, both thematically and musically. everything about it feels blown up to epic proportions (indeed, the songs are much longer on average), and the band feels more in control of its direction. you'd never know it by the lyrics, though -- in one way or another, nearly every song on Master of Puppets deals with the fear of powerlessness. sometimes they're about hypocritical authority (military and religious leaders), sometimes primal, uncontrollable human urges (drugs, insanity, rage), and, in true H.P. Lovecraft fashion, sometimes monsters. yet by bookending the album with two slices of thrash mayhem (\\"Battery\\" and \\"Damage, Inc.\\"), the band reigns triumphant through sheer force -- of sound, of will, of malice. the arrangements are thick and muscular, and the material varies enough in texture and tempo to hold interest through all its twists and turns. some critics have called Master of Puppets the best heavy metal album ever recorded; if it isn't, it certainly comes close.
B000063DFS|4.0|Ozzy, being my favorite musical artist of all time has created albums and every single one continues to impress me. This was a very well made album with a good musician and a good mix. I was a little disappointed because of there was a certain commercialized aspect of it.
B0000028RR|5.0|the first album to successfully merge the amazingly disparate sounds of rap and heavy metal, Rage Against the Machine's self-titled debut was groundbreaking enough when it was released, and many would argue that its importance and influence remains unchallenged and unsurpassed to this day. the living embodiment of this culture clash, guitar wizard Tom Morello fuses his roots in '80s metal-style shredding with an unprecedented array of six-string acrobatics and rhythmic special effects, most of which no one has even tried to imitate. and from vocalist Zack de la Rocha, the group receives meaningful rhymes and emotionally charged delivery. still, despite the unique elements upon which they are built, songs like \\"Bombtrack,\\" \\"Take the Power Back,\\" and \\"Know Your Enemy\\" are immediately memorable, surprisingly straightforward slabs of hard rock. and one need not look further than the main riff of the venomous \\"Wake Up\\" -- lifted straight out of Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\" -- for conclusive proof of Morello's influences. even more impressive is the group's talent for injecting slowly mounting tension into such highlights as \\"Settle for Nothing\\" and \\"Bullet in the Head,\\" both of which finally explode with awesome power and rage. in contrast, the band manages to convey their message with even more urgency through stubborn repetition, as seen on \\"Freedom\\" and their signature track, \\"Killing in the Name.\\" with its relentlessly rebellious mantra of, \\"F*ck you, I won't do what you tell me,\\" the song is a rallying cry of frightening proportions and the unequivocal climax of their vision. a stunning debut that remains absolutely essential.
B000002H33|5.0|This is definitely my favorite Metallica album. The only album that maybe compares to it is And Justice For All. It's only their second album, and is perfectly mixed, and is harder than ever. Should take 6 stars.
B00000099Y|5.0|for their third release, Tool explore the progressive rock territory previously forged by such bands as King Crimson. however, Tool are conceptually innovative with every minute detail of their art, which sets them apart from most bands. make no mistake, this isn't your father's rock record. sonically, the band has never sounded tighter. long exploratory passages are unleashed with amazing precision, detail, and clarity, which only complements the aggressive, abrasive shorter pieces on the album. there is no compromise from any member of the band, with each of them discovering the dynamics of his respective instrument and pushing the physical capabilities to the limit. topics such as the philosophies of Bill Hicks (eloquently eulogized in the packaging), evolution and genetics, and false martyrdom will fly over the heads of casual listeners. but those listening closely will discover a special treat: a catalyst encouraging them to discover a world around them to which they otherwise might have been blind. if these aren't good enough reasons to listen to Ænima, then just trust the simple fact that Tool deliver the hard rock goods every time the band chooses to release something.
B000002H97|5.0|This was an awesome Metallica album. It was after this point that the quality of their music started going downhill. The only bad thing about this album was that it was a little too commercialized.
B00005JL96|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! I laughed more than my son did. It is warm, funny, and imaginative and the best animated feature I've seen by Disney in years. On the planet Turo, amad scientist has created a miniature monster programmed for destruction. When the monster escapes to Earth, it's adopted as a pet and named \\"Stitch\\" by Lilo, a lonely little Hawaiian girl. What follows are some very funny adventures!! In the process, they learn that a family can be something you're born into ~ or something you create.
B000068QZK|5.0|This was Ozzy's first album with the guitarist Zakk Wylde. He may not be as good as Randy was, but for a nineteen-year-old, he could really rip! I enjoy listening to every song on here. Here's my ratings: <br /> <br />Miracle Man 5/5 <br />Devil's Daughter 4/5 <br />Crazy Babies 5/5 <br />Breaking all the Rules 5/5 <br />Bloodbath in Paradise 5/5 <br />Fire in the Sky 5/5 <br />Tattooed Dancer 5/5 <br />Demon Alchohol 5/5 <br />Hero 3/5
B00005R1N3|4.0|i really enjoyed this movie. it kept me guessing until the end but the surprise ending was not what i expected.  all you horror movie buffs this is a must have for your collection.
B000063DIR|5.0|I feel bad when I see low reviews of this album, or when somebody says it was a bad album. It may not be as rockin' of an album as Blizzard of Ozz, but the music is so well mixed and Randy was at his best work during this album. It's not all just distortion and headbanging like the previous album; there is more skill and theory involved, like in songs like Diary of a Madman, or You Can't Kill Rock'n'Roll. The music is very varied on here. It is Ozzy's best.
B00006EXL5|5.0|My Chemical Romance are a group of guys who's talent will astonish you!  With their first album, they've written lyrics that make you think deeper about things.  It's nice to see something thats not the same old \\"I'm in love with this girl\\" type of songs.  Their words have a meaning deeper than one can interpret! The Album is simply amazing!
0062502182|5.0|From Stendahl, to Voltaire, back to Cervantes, and the wonders of Dumas I read to learn how others have coped with life. Intelligent minds suffer in a world where the bell curve seems to conspire against us. We feign to disdaine simplicity. Revel in our seeming understandings of complexity, which obfuscate the reason we BREATHE. The common language. <br /> <br />Two years ago, I met a simple woman from a small farming village, in a very distant land. Slowly, I saw that my sophistry could not compare to the simple joys she and her villagers obtained from picking rice, drinking bad whiskey made from it, and living the maxim \\"you only get one life.\\"  <br /> <br />In the intervening two years, I made 13 trips to her land. We married. As I sit here typing, early in the morning, my job is the last thing on my mind. I want to go back in a few minutes, lie with her, and hold her hand. Supporting her, and soon my daughter is my Personal Legend. Seeing her smile, helping her Grandfather acquire new teeth, teaches me how to become the wind. <br /> <br />Some books will take you on an Odyssey. Some steps in your life are torturous. I climb mountains on a bicycle. Sometimes, for 13 hours at a time. I feel the pain in my lower back, at the age of 45. My legs scream. The ascent, is always better than the summit. It is not the top, but the side of the mountain that sustains life. I am alone, often, in these climbs. The field seperates, as the hours grind on. As Paulo suggests, it is the fear of the struggle, rather than the actual struggle we notice. Each climb, adds inches to my life.  <br /> <br />I loved this book. Like most great books, the characters and the message is universal. Like most great books, it holds a ruthless mirror to our soul. It changes your dreams, or makes them palpable.  <br /> <br />Within the next year, I must leave the drab trappings of success, and open the business that is my dream. The omens are all around me, and now I listen.
B000B0WO0I|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Simply Red since the beginning, and it seems that with every album they just get better and better, and Mick Hucknall is truly imcomparable, and totally underrated in the U.S. This album is just lovely...his vocals and reworking of songs like \\"For Your Babies\\" and \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\\" are nothing short of perfect. This CD is everything I expect from Simply Red and \\"more.\\" <br />
0316172324|3.0|This is a quick read and suitable for anyone who is human and struggles therefore with inherent patterns of emotion and thought that result in actions that can be either harmful or helpful to yourself and others.  This is my interpretation of Malcolm's objective but somewhat rambling style, of this book which by matter of fact points out that stereotypes can and do taint our decisions but how we can also leverage this intuitive power to make better decisions in a blink.  To turn this weakness into strength we need to develop our expertise and ourselves as Malcolm shows us through examples with police officers, food tasters and mind readers!  Malcolm is subtly helping us to become aware as we learn about how commercial strategies can convince us to like certain flavors and other suggestions that impact our daily lives maybe without our even knowing.  Since 55% of communication is non verbal, Malcolm's inclusion of Ekman's facial studies should incline us to pay better attention to that which is not said by our politicians; actions speak much louder than words.  References to Ekman's research and the unknown depths of the unconscious although brief, might be enough for readers to seek more understanding about their own locked rooms so they can in turn air them out.  Malcolm's own experiences when he grew a mess of curly hair tactfully placed outside the book in the Acknowledgement end pages further proves his point that is \\"the truly successful decision making relies on a balance between deliberate and instinctive thinking;\\" sometimes we need to consider the obvious so we can think. <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|3.0|...I wouldn't like it. But I am obliged to like it, because I have strongly admired him for his entire career. He holds the Blue Ribbon, Top Prize, for the best rock vocal performance in the history of Earth with \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Oh Darlin\\" - among others (in my opinion). I have studied his music. I have been greatly influenced by his music. And, as a musician, I HAVE to like it. But I miss something from him very much... I miss the Creative Boundary smashing Paul. The Damn The Torpedos Paul. The kind of \\"Creations\\" that are ground breaking and that have musical depth, i.e. \\"We Got Married\\", \\"wonderlust\\", \\"Biker Like an Icon\\", \\"Arrow Through Me\\" !!!, and scadds of others of course, not to even mention the earlier timeless MASTERpieces that he conceived in the Beatles era. Where's the musical melodic journey, the harmonic challenges that require more listening than 2 or 3 passes to \\"Get it\\"... or has his creativity grown so advanced that its too beyond me to hear it. I don't mean to sound harsh. I love PM music with a passion, and I always will. The fact the he is still doing it, and still outshines most at his age and genre, is so great that I can be content with that alone. I own a copy of EVERYTHING he has ever published, and will continue that collection no matter what... it could be 15 tracks of farts and I'll buy it. But, I have heard what's in him... and that kind of soul never dies. Paul, break away the comfort cobwebs, dig deep, wake up the muse and rip our heads off. With great love - A fellow musician. UPDATE 2/14/06: I have to admit the more I listen the more I like it... but still.... 3/5 stars
0743243315|4.0|Shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2003, this is the story of Nazneen, from her birth in a village in Bangladesh, to her physical settlement in London's East End for an arranged marriage, to her emotional settlement as a (relatively) independent woman, the mother of daughters who are, despite their family environment, inevitably going to grow up more English in their ways than Bangladeshi. It is a fine novel, providing rich, colourful insights into the culture of a first generation in a new country. The main characters, Nazneen and her husband Chanu are believable and sympathetically developed. Ali doesn't take sides in their relationship, the reader understands the needs and aspirations of both of them, and what this means for their marriage. The supporting characters, especially Dr Azad, Mrs Islam and Razia add another layer of richness to the narrative. There is tragedy, sadness, conflict, touches of pathos and humour and ultimately, hope. Highly recommended.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I can't listen to this DVD enough... The songs, harmony, guitar-playing and music are amazing.  If you love great lyrics and great music, this DVD is a must.  Sit back, relax and be amazed by great music for hours.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I adore this movie and would love to have it on DVD, but  I don't want it in fullscreen.  As to the song - When the movie came out, I had the soundtrack nearly memorized and was shocked in the theater when at what was clearly the correct moment for \\"The Love is Gone\\" they played only the instrumental background and not the vocals.  This was especially puzzling as the closing song, which was left in, directly referred back to the lyrics of \\"The Love is Gone\\".  The song clearly belongs in the movie and I never could figure out why it was absent, but at my local theater they showed a cut version.  I'll rent this to see what's on it, but I'm not buying until I can get the complete movie on widescreen.
B000002J1S|4.0|1974 was not just the end of an era for Genesis, but for progressive rock as a whole. King Crimson had already disbanded as Robert Fripp prepared for the apocalypse and following the release of Relayer Yes brought to an end their status as a cutting-edge band.  <br /> <br />We are frequently told that history repeats itself. It is ironic then, that just as the opening bars of Wagner's great music-drama Tristan and Isolde introduced a tonal instability that would eventually bring the curtain down on the romantic era, elements of progressive rock's demise can be found in one of its crowning works, be it in the radio hit \\"Counting out Time\\" that would chart the direction of Genesis in the years to come, or even the hints of punk rock, prog's antithesis, in the raucous gang-evocation \\"Back in NYC\\". <br /> <br />Like the aforementioned Wagner work, \\"The Lamb lies down on Broadway\\" is not just a noteworthy implementation of contemporary musical styles, but an exploration of uncharted territory. Perhaps the most significant musical difference is the separation of the Strawberry Fields styled soundscapes that permeate previous Genesis works (The Cinema Show, Supper's Ready) and the tight-structured songs that exist alongside. This may have been a conscious development, or merely a symptom of the narrative-frieze structure that the existence of a linking plot lends itself to, but whichever it allowed Genesis to create some of their most memorable and accessible songs without sacrificing their unique scene-painting ability. <br /> <br />The title track, combining a classic bass line with a wonderfully constructed chord-progression driven on by a driving keyboard figure and Gabriel's marvellous evocation of a waking New York is one of the most remarkable openings to any rock album. Inevitably, such quality is not sustained throughout the album, which frequently flirts with both the timeless (Carpet Crawlers, Anyway) and the forgettable (Cuckoo Cocoon, The Grand Parade). <br /><br />That said, in haunting lullaby \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" (derived from the title track's bridge), the upbeat classic \\"Anyway\\", the wonderful melodic realisation of \\"glorious romantic tragedy\\" in \\"The Lamia\\" and the recapitulation, \\"The Light Dies Down..\\", a synthesis of the title track and the Lamia, there are more than enough highlights to justify the album's ambitious concept. <br /> <br />Whilst it may not be the most consistent album Genesis ever made, it is easy to see why many fans regard it as the best.
1400049628|5.0|It's all about tone, this book. It would have been easy for Brooks to simply write a survival-type manual with only the barest mention of zombies, but instead he cleverly weaves his own version of zombie lore into the narrative, and if you've ever seen a zombie film - especially of the \\"nazi zombies come to life\\" variety - you'll grin as if your face had been slit horizontally with a razor and then pulled upwards and backwards. It is one of a clutch of \\"toilet reads\\" that came out about the same time (I believe there is also a guide on how to survive a robot revolt) and it is the best.    Brooks is clearly a Fan and has a quiet riot with deadpan, alarmingly matter-of-fact advice on how to decapitate the living dead with samurai fighting shovels. He pooh-poohs the computer game staples of chainsaw and shotgun, and includes advice on baiting and trapping zombies. Particularly entertaining are the sections which deal with weapons and killing the undead, and you will enjoy them as well if you are separated from conventional sensibility and have a sick sense of human. Humour. A sick sense of humour.    There's an extremely impressive level of detail as well, and Brooks keeps digging and digging as if he had been given a deadline extension and a big bag of filter coffee. He even covers so-called \\"voodoo zombies\\", the real-life inspiration for the fictional living dead, although he holds out little possibility for controlling the actual fictional undead zombie of fiction. I get the impression that Max Brooks had a lonely childhood with no playmates, and had to imagine his friends.    There's also a lot of general survival advice of a sort you find all over the internet, about keeping water purificaton tablets and torches to hand, making up a 'bug out' kit and so forth. This part of the book might actually come in useful in real life, although it seems to be mostly common sense, and I would be wary about revealing to any of my co-refugees that I was taking advice from a book about surviving zombie attacks written by the son of the man who did \\"Blazing Saddles\\" and \\"Young Frankenstein\\".    The only flaw is that the descriptions of zombie attacks at the back of the book are a bit flat; the Onion-esque way that they resemble real-life events and are vaguely plausible is clever, but they aren't particularly engaging, and this section make up almost a third of the book. The advice occasionally contradicts itself, at various times claiming that it's best to hole up in an urban environment with lots of supplies, and at others advising the reader to head for the hills. Still, I'm not going to nitpick a book about surviving a zombie attack.
B000B5IPLK|4.0|I love Alicia -- hands down she is right up there with Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, etc.  She is extremely talented and a pleasure to watch develop her style and artistry BUT.. <br />Am I the only one that hears how FLAT she is during a few of these songs?  And she strains her voice (yells) at the end of 'If I Was Your Woman' -- it is downright PAINFUL!  Now I am not a fan who expects perfection (I actually appreciate Lauryn Hill's Unplugged for her honest voice with all its imperfections and I  LOVE Mary J and she is constantly flat!)but there are times where Alicia's Unplugged tracks would make my dog howl!  Still, I think she is brilliant and am enjoying the CD -- her arrangements are tight and her backup singers are fantastic! I'm just skipping over the odd song as I listen.  Get the CD, for sure, and enjoy her abilities, just keep your dog out of the room! <br />
0446678430|4.0|Numerous reviewers of this book are disappointed that Kiyosaki does not present a detailed HOW TO become wealthy. <br /> <br />     But just think about it---how MANY \\"how to\\" books are already out there? There are hundreds (maybe thousands) of books on HOW TO become rich in real estate, HOW TO become rich investing, HOW TO succeed at creating a business, etc. <br /> <br />      One would have to assume that if all the \\"knowledge\\" in these books were actually applied, the U.S. (and much of the world) would be filled with very wealthy people. <br /> <br />      Yet U.S. government (SSA)  statistics tell us that only about 5% of Americans will be financially free by age 65. Is there a major disconnect here? <br /> <br />     What makes Kiyosaki unique is that he presents the all-important Mindset, without which all the \\"How To's\\" in the world will be of little value. <br /> <br />     I have read a few of his other books. Not remembering exactly which principles came from which book, I recall the following essential principles: <br /> <br />1)  Do a self inventory--do you want to be Secure, Comfortable, or Rich? <br /> <br />2)  Use the Cashflow Quadrant to determine your predominant emotional makeup as regards money--Employee, Self-Employed, Business creator, or Investor. <br /> <br />(someone with a deeply entrenched Employee mindset will have a hard time taking the risks necessary to build a B-Quadrant business.) <br /> <br />3)  Decide what kind of Investor you want to be (I think there are 7 levels) <br /> <br />These three items are the essential SELF-INVENTORY you need BEFORE trying to become rich. <br /> <br />Once you have completed the inventories and decided on your own path to wealth it is essential... <br /> <br />4)  to form your Team (accountant, attorney, financial adviser, tax adviser, etc., etc.)  And you should NOT be the smartest member of your team! You should gather and lead people smarter than yourself. (The ability to do this alone is a MAJOR skill!) <br /> <br />5)  If you want to build a B-Quadrant business, you must follow the B-I Triangle. <br /> <br />Well, I could go on and on, but I would bet 99-1 that most of the complainers about Kiyosaki's books have NOT done any of the above. <br /> <br />Concerning Retire Young, Retire Rich,  one of the essentials is to decide WHY you want to become rich--\\"If you know the WHY, the HOW is easy to find.\\" <br /> <br />And the use of Leverage and Velocity of money is absolutely essential--and differentiates the rich from the average person. <br /> <br />In short, this book, repetitive though it is, continues to give the reader ways and self-inventories to develop the Mindset of creating wealth and being wealthy. <br /> <br />Most of us who did not grow up with wealth, or surrounded by wealthy people, need a major conversion of Mindset in order to see the whole world of money in a new and more vital way. <br /> <br />This is the value of the Kiyosaki Rich Dad series. <br /> <br />Without the Mindset and the WHY of wanting to retire young and retire rich, all the how-to's in the world are of little value. <br /> <br />4 Stars just because the book IS awfully redundant in places.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|Fan since 1983.  This album is OK, and much better than the last 2.  However, DM doesn't sound like DM anymore - what should be the best electronic music anywhere.  Almost a return to form, especially considering the awsome \\"Suffer Well\\" but not quite.  The best songs are Precious, which sounds like a variant of their work on A Broken Frame with Guitars, and Suffer Well.<br /><br />Missing is the trademark Alan Wilder sound that \\"made it sound like Depeche Mode\\" - that layered, epic synth sound that started with Construction Time Again, became ground breaking sampling work on Some Great Reward, converted millions of teens on Black Celebration listing on the earphones in their bedrooms, became pop music with MFTM, became super-stardom with Violator, and ended with a rock romp with SOFAD.  Sure, there's been a few good songs since, but no decent album.<br /><br />The Martin-sung songs on here are just silly.  John the Revelator is just a bad SOFAD left-over that was warmed up.  Lillian is OK.  The opening track is OK, but too much noise and not enough musicianship (or synthwork).  Everything else is pretty boring, yet not as boring as Exciter.<br /><br />So, PLEASE HIRE ALAN WILDER TO PRODUCE THE NEXT ALBUM!!!<br /><br />If you want a better contemporary DM-type album, do yourself a favor and search Amazon for Iris's \\"Wrath\\" album (or any album by Iris for that matter).  After listening to that album, you'll realize your a fool if you are an electronic music fan and rated this one 5 stars.
B000000OQY|3.0|This was a little odd for a band like Guns N'Roses to put out, especially since they were at the point in their career that they were.  It's not their last effort, The Spaghetti Incident?, which left people going \\"Huh?\\" and scratching their heads, but it was rather a collection of acoustic efforts.  Their famous power ballad, \\"Patience\\", was one of their biggest hits, but the rest was lukewarm. <br /> <br />If you're going to do an album as a complete departure from what you were doing before, you have to give it 100%.  This was clearly put together in a few evenings of just sitting around and playing and left the producers to mix it to perfection.  It seems to me as a spur of the moment decission that they put this together then decided to releast it.  And that \\"One In A Million\\" song with the supposed apology on the front cover?  It was stupid to print something like that, and it was double stupid for them to release something like that for other than publicity.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Will the mail in poster offer be redeemable by people living outside the United States and/or Canada?
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Introspectre reminds me a bit of Agent Orange's despair, same with Damaged People.    PTA gets 4 stars.. mostly due to Lilian.. which is a masterpiece of entertaining value.  PTA probably would have gotten 3 stars without.  It's hard to take this album on its own, especially with such a deep catalogue to reference.  With each DM album release I fret.  Usually, with good reasons.  I do try to adapt to their new sound.  Speak & Spell doesn't sound anything like other Mode albums, nor does A Broken Frame.. CTA and SGR definitely sound alike, but I can tell the difference between both.  BC musically stands by itself, but so do MFTM, Violator, SOFAD, ULTRA, and Exciter.  PTA will also stand by itself.  Comparisons between albums are quite useless seeing each album is different from one another.  The one factor that tied all albums together was MLG's songwriting, which was superb from BC to SOFAD, but has struggled with recent efforts.  I remember rushing home after buying the newest DM album and reading the lyrics and just being engrossed by the whole process.  Perhaps it's due to the unwanted process of growing up, but that magical element has disappeared.  I tried with this album, but I was quite confused by its lyrics.  They're simply not up to par.  And the artwork, another defining Mode element, doesn't create any style.  Violator's single red rose on a black cover just oozed of sexiness.  An \\"angel\\" made out of feathers?  Where do you go with that?  Also, way too many pictures of the band in the insert.  The PTA cover would be good for Dave's Paper Monster.  I wonder how many bands will be influenced by the new DM album.  Wonder wonder.
B000002LSV|5.0|This is a great CD with lots of memorable music on it.
B000B0WO0I|4.0|NOTE:  This is coming from a 19-year fan and avid collector--have a whole lot of back catalog to compare this to.  :) <br /> <br />'Simplified' is as much proof as you can ask for that Simply Red are indeed a BAND and not just a MAN; the quality of the musicianship shines through in every track.  This is the best lineup Mick Hucknall has had behind him, without a doubt.  For new fans to the music, it is a great album from start to finish, and a great springboard for exploring the other albums.  For returning fans...the remade tracks may not be everyone's cup of tea, particularly if this version varies drastically from the original, and you're a big fan of the first run.  Personally speaking, the new versions of \\"Something Got Me Started\\", \\"More\\", and \\"Sad Old Red\\" are forces to be reckoned with; the new \\"Your Mirror\\" and \\"Fairground\\", however, just don't trip my trigger.  But it's all a matter of personal taste.  There's something here for everyone, as there is on every Simply Red album; still worth the money.  Use this as inspiration to pick up 'Home', 'Picture Book', 'Stars', and 'Life' if they're not already a part of your collection.

0452282152|3.0|For this novel, Tracy Chevalier has seemingly outdone herself not only in the theme of writing well, but doing as many other authors enjoy to do, is to give a message to the readers, not directly, but in all subtlety. <br />The book itself narrates the story about life in the 17th century where Griet, a poor Dutch girl, decides, in order to aid her family's financial difficulties, to work for the famous painter, Johannes Vermeer. <br />As she suffers through the hardships of a maid's life, she encounters an unknown factor that had only been revealed to her in small quantities: Art.  <br />A romantic, yet discreet relationship builds between the painter and the maid, and as his wife's jealousy increases, so does Griet's troubles. This book, which was originally supposed to be a biography for Jan Vermeer and his famous paintings, finally also managed to make us live through that century's living conditions and the way things worked (if you had money, you had everything.). <br />Although this book had an increasingly interesting plot, it miraculously managed to turn everything into a senseless and utter bore. <br />The whole book is speaking of how Griet notices signs of affection from Mr. Vermeer, how she notices Catharina Vermeer's jealousy, how she notices the effect she has upon butchers, how she notices the wonders of 17th century art, and other things she is constantly noticing, but never seems to take any act upon anything that happens to her. <br />Tracy Chevalier has undoubtedly made a lot of research concerning the subject, but all of these facts remain lost to the readers. The story is an interesting one, but you need to really have the spirit and interest to take it on. <br />
B000003TAL|5.0|I can't believe I waited until this year to buy this album. <br /> <br />If I could sum this album up in one word, i would say \\"breathtaking\\". This album is so full of glorious moments... <br />Kim screaming the lyrics to \\"Cross The Breeze\\", the gorgeous guitar soundscape of \\"Candle\\", the break into screaming dissonance in the punk-ish \\"Silver Rocket\\", the vicious rant of \\"Eliminator Jr.\\", the beautiful harmonies of \\"The Sprawl\\", the almost-lullaby \\"Kissability\\"...it's all amazing. <br /> <br />Almost every album that has clocked in at 70 minutes that I've heard has grown dull somewhere along the line, but not this one. You will be enthralled from start to finish. <br /> <br />If you're even comprehending buying this album, please do so immediately. If you're thinking about NOT buying it, think about this. <br /> <br />A complete change in your view of the beauty of music - $10 <br />Would you buy it? <br /> <br />peace
B000000H5J|5.0|Fear Factory's second full length album, \\"Demanufacture,\\" is their first with the classic line-up (including bassist Christian Olde Welbers). This album isn't as heavy as their debut (1992's \\"Soul of a New Machine\\"), but it's still very brutal. Even though it features some keyboards (\\"Zero Signal\\") and sound effects (\\"Body Hammer\\"),  \\"Demanufacture\\" is definitely closer to being a death metal record than industrial metal. It has almost constant pounding double bass drums and hefty guitars, as well as vocals which alternate from heavy yelling to limpid singing (i.e. \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\").<br /><br />\\"Demanufacture\\" also includes Fear Factory's famous sci-fi themes, because this is actually a concept album. It tells a futuristic story about a man who is fed up with the machine controlled government, and wants to destroy it. Each song is a different \\"chapter\\" in his life.<br /><br />Track five, \\"New Breed,\\" is a fan favorite, so it's obviously a highlight. Other standout tracks include my personal favorite, the title track, which has machine gun kick drums complemented by punching riffs and bellows of \\"I've got no more regrets!\\" \\"Self Bias Resistor\\" has even faster, almost buzzsaw drumming and a pounding rhythm, which are offset by clean, backing vocals. Next, \\"Replica\\" has a great breakdown, with stop-start bursts of jackhammer guitars and drums. \\"Flashpoint\\" has rhythmic, skipping guitars while Raymond is going crazy back there on drums, and \\"H - K\\" has more great drumming (from lightning fast blasts to slow chugs).<br /><br />Many Fear Factory fans consider this the band's best album, and nobody should blame them for thinking that. It is not my personal favorite C.D. by them, but it is still a really great, nearly classic album that has my vote for the best metal release of 1995.

B000B2YQX4|4.0|Still DM ,but I think the best days are behind them for good. <br />After great \\"Ultra\\" and somehow disappointing \\"Exciter\\" new album seems to follow strange and dangerous path. <br /> <br />To all hardcore five star fans:-C'mon guys this album ain't deserve five stars and you know this well. <br />I have been hardcore DM fan like you since 1982,collecting all bootlegs and remixes and I really miss old /read-\\"young\\"/ Depeche Mode. <br /> <br />I was lucky to meet Martin Gore in June in NYC and talk a while about new album-it was something for me...., <br />But I have to admit I'm a little disappointed & nervous about our beloved DM future. <br /> <br />Four stars-Out of respect.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Elliott Smith is the most talented musician and song writer you will ever have a chance to listen to. Figure 8 is Elliott's 5th solo album. From the first song until the last you will be blown away by this magical masterpiece. Elliott's acoustics and piano are sensational as well as the talented song writing throughout the album. The way the music blends in with Elliot's singing just gives you the chills. Not a bad song on the album. If Elliott got the recognition he deserved in the music industry this album would have went gold. This record should be in the top 100 of all time. Read the reviews on all of Elliott's work. There all 4.5 to 5 Stars. A Masterpiece!!
0312330529|5.0|I've read hundreds of books in my lifetime, but Shantaram has to be one of the best books that I've ever read.  If even half of what happened in the book is true - it's simply amazing.  Mr. Roberts makes us care about all of the characters, and despite the multitude, most are three dimensional.  It's a page-turner.  I've never read through 900+ pages so fast and wait for bated breath for the prequel and the sequel.  Simply fantastic!
1400032717|5.0|I absolutly LOVED this book and could not put it down until I finished it.  For anyone who loves intelligent writing with a very strong human element, you will definitely enjoy this read.  I found myself laughing out loud at times, recalling college math at times and feeling deep sympathy and empathy at times.  It NEVER seemed fake or contrived.  It flowed and the author never let Christopher break character.  Any book that is entertaining and makes you think this much is nothing less than a wonderful work of art!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I've been a fan since 1985. I have every single cd, single, remix, etc. It's rather pathetic how much I love this band. But after Exciter I  was under the impression this band that I love was washed up, too old, too bored, too who knows what. Let's face it, Exciter sucked. <br />This album is what I've been waiting for. I feel bad that Martin got divorced and his life is in turmoil but damn it makes for some great lyrics and an overall awesome dark, brooding vibe. I mean really, pain leads to good music. It's just a fact. <br />Now to go over each song. <br /> <br />1. A Pain I'm Used To: Slightly industrial vibe but not nearly as annoying as say \\"In The Dead of Night.\\" This is just loud and screechy enough to be cool without making my ears bleed. 4.5/5 <br />2. John The Revelator: You have got to be kidding me! This song is so infectious. I LOVE this song. It's like what SOFAD wanted to be but just never quite got to. This ties for my favorite on the album. 5/5 <br />3. Suffer Well: I'm glad Dave is writing. There's some good lyrics here. Great DM song. Fortunately, it's better than anything on Paper Monsters. I love the guitar line and I can't wait to hear the remixes off this one. 5/5 <br />4. The Sinner In Me: Not as stong as the first 3 songs but I like the driving synth bass line. 4/5 <br />5. Precious: In my opinion, the best song Depeche Mode has done since Violator's Enjoy the Silence. The lyrics are painful, truthful, and really grab a hold of your heart and twist. This ties for my favorite along with John The Revelator. 5/5 <br />6. Macro: I love Martin. I really do. I love his voice. I often like the songs he sings on. Expecially Home and The Things you said but this is cheesy. Maybe it'll grow on me. Who knows. But for now it reminds me of the horriblness that was \\"Comatose\\". And the word microcosm just doesn't belong in any song at any time ever. 2/5 <br />7. I want it all: Another song written by Dave. I'm not quite sure about this one yet. I like thelyrics but it just doesn't seem to fit on the album. However, I think his vocals are supurb on this and it flows along quite well so I give it 3/5 <br />8. Nothing's Impossible: The last song penned by Dave. I really like this one. It's darker and moodier than anything else on the album and frankly that's what I've always loved about DM. I like the monotonish vocals that some people complain about. I think it makes this song incredibly black. 5/5 <br />9. Introspecrtre: Nice little instrumental. Nothing spectacular but it fits. 3.5/5 <br />10. Damaged People: Much better than the other song that Martin sings. I like the harmonies on this one. 4/5 <br />11. Lilian: Oh gee I wonder who this might be about. Somebody got seriously screwed over. Great song. Love the music, love the lyrics. I think it's brilliant the way this song flows. One of my favorites on the album 5/5 <br />12. The Darkest Star: This is a good ending song. If it were in the middle it would seem boring but you want your cd to wind down towards the end and fall into the abyss. This is what The Darkest Star does. Excellent 4/5 <br /> <br />Overall 5/5. I'm so happy that DM is back!!!
B00007AJF9|3.0|While aspects of this film are gorgeous to view, including scenery, sets, costumes, the plot was confusing at times and substantially distorted actual history and historical persons to offer a Hollywood \\"drama\\".  Cate Blanchett did her best with the storyline as written and directed and looked much like I would expect Elizabeth to look as a young woman.  And Joseph Fiennes captured the essence of Robert Dudley as I imagine him in his youth and as he appears in a portrait painted of him as a young man.  I really object to the portrayal of Robert at the end of the film and how they showed Elizabeth as \\"Gloriana\\" when she was no more than 30.  While Elizabeth and Robert had a tumultuous relationship, they always came back together until his death when they were in their mid-50s and even then, Elizabeth most likely held him in her heart until her death in 1603 (as evidenced by his \\"Last Letter\\" kept in her treasure box by her bed). <br /> <br />The 1970's film, \\"Mary, Queen of Scots\\", more faithfully captures the true essence of Elizabeth (albeit still distorting historical fact).  The movie stars Vanessa Redgrave as Mary and Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth, who in my mind is THE Elizabeth on screen. While the film focuses on Mary and her travails, Elizabeth's story is well represented here, too.  Trever Howard as Cecil is heads above Mr. Attenborough.  And Daniel Massey as Robert Dudley ain't bad either.  And of course, there are plenty of biographies and other non-fiction books about Elizabeth, her life and times if you really want learn the \\"truth\\". <br /> <br />But ultimately, the portrayal of Elizabeth I that catches my breath, that speaks to me across the centuries is the Elizabeth of Sharon Kaye's novel, \\"Legacy\\". I still cry when I read the last chapter and it is almost magical as it describes the inner  thoughts, feelings, and conflicts about such a down to earth woman.  If you are a \\"fan\\" of Elizabeth or just want to read a good book, find it, if you can, and ENJOY!
B00006EXL5|5.0|MCR really has come a long way since the release of this album. They're just finishing up their tour with Alkaline Trio and some other band and they've become somewhat of an idol. They've collected the most eclectic group of followers of any band I've ever heard. And they're still going strong with another album on the way. While Revenge is a wonderful album, it's always interesting to understand the humble origins a distinguished band came from. So I delved into this album, spurred on mostly by the song Headfirst for Halos (a song that a suicidal person just *might* not want to listen to). <br /> <br />What I found was a treasure. It eminates the exact spirit that the band attempts on a regular basis to capture. It is MCR in their most basic form. It's starter sets the stage for the emotion that permeates every ounce of the cd. The rest of the cd just falls into place, offering a host of aggressive instrumentals and vocals with a few break songs scattered in between. Every song builds on the last until the level of emotion is almost unbearable. These are the kind of songs that will draw you in and never let you go - constantly tantalizing the listener with just one more guitar riff; one more energy filled chorus; one more dramatic opening. Before you realize it, the album is done and you're just left with this feeling of numbness... <br /> <br />Gerard's vocals are simply amazing. I know he's been criticized for \\"how out of tune he sounds\\" as characterized by one previous reviewer. I may just be naive, but emo is supposed to be... well emotional. Could it be possible that maybe - just maybe - he's being emotional? And believe me, there's no lack of emotion in his voice: he sings every song perfectly for the mood that song is supposed to enhance. I'd like to see the singer of Brand New, The Used, Finch, Taking Back Sunday, etc. bring what Gerard brings. <br /> <br />And to clarify something, Skylines and Turnstiles is *supposed* to sound rough... it's the first songthe Gerard wrote and preserves them at their first and finest. It's unaltered MCR - something you'd have to go to a concert to see.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I would to have all 4 on DVD,because I think Chris O'Donnell is Delicious in his Robin Outfit![Wolf Whistle] Who Are You? I'm Batman.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|I loved the idea when i first heard about it, the 4 team captians with musicians from bands that have graced the roadrunner label. So I bought the CD the day it came out which was a week ago yesterday and I haven't taken it out of my CD player its rare for me to find a CD like that. There are a few tracks I dont care too much for like the Dani Filth track, the music is amazing on it I just don't care too much for his voice. Some of the Stronger tracks are, The Enemy, Annilation By The Hands Of God, The End, The Rich Man, and Blood and Flames. Those are just key tracks but the whole CD is amazing.
B0000024ZI|5.0|That period was a creative explosion, and Mott's jump to stardom from obscurity was one of the hallmarks of a special time alongside Dark Side of the Moon, Strawbs, Yes, Bowie, Lou Reed's Transformer... oh, the list is long. <br /> <br />Every song here has its strengths, and the production is cracker-jack. Remains my favorite version of Lou Reed's \\"Sweet Jane,\\" and \\"Sucker\\" is a fab Ian Hunter original. <br /> <br />
B000001F3C|4.0|I like this early version of U2's music more than the chillbeat popfest they became later. This music movs me. Und I want to be moved by voice, not techno beat.
0553573403|3.0|The writing is fantastic and the plots seem to be well thought out.<br /><br />However, the reason I quit reading this series after the first two is that GRRM has (as been said in other reviews) a nasty habit of getting you emotionally involved in a character and then killing that character off.  It started as shocking, but soon turned to extremely annoying.<br /><br />Having said that, if you are really into writing style and plot and don't really care about characters, this is a great series.  I need to care about a character in order to enjoy a story, but I kept feeling cheated in these books.<br /><br />I'd like to emphasize that his writing is outstanding and he has good plots.  If not for that one liiiiitle problem, I would have gladly continued the series.<br /><br />If you're a plot-person (like many seem to be) then I would highly recommend this.  It only gets 3 stars from me because I think he enjoys killing off lots of characters and I don't happen to like that in my reading.

0435905252|5.0|Right up there with the best novels, it is deceptively short and simple, but of bottomless depth. I first read this book in my high school literature class, in the 1970s when I was maybe 14 years old, and I read it a few more times on my own after that, because it had so much to teach. That was in the same three year period that I also read (again on my own) George Orwell's I984, A Brave New World, Franz Fanon's Wretched of the Earth, The Upanishads, most of the African Writer's Series and a lot of Isaac Asimov and Philip Dick. Needless to say, Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart grounded me as an African Human Being, growing up during a cultural and political tsunami which continues till this day. Devastating to the continent, but an excellent opportunity for personal growth.  <br /> <br />One of the great features of many African cultures and particularly of the Ibo culture, are the wonderful proverbs. In pre-literate societies, proverbs are an incomparable way of encapsulating chapters of wisdom in small packages of words. Things Fall Apart is a treasure throve of proverbs some of which I still use till this day. Reading some of the reviews here, I found that some readers were baffled by the proverbs and failed to absorb the imagery dismissing them as primitive fables or things along those lines. May you not be accused of the insularity of an Okonkwo, the principal character in this book, because inflexible materials tend to crack under sufficient pressure - like Okonkwo. I have not read TFA for over a decade now, but think about this one: <br /> <br />\\"A child who washes his or her hands may eat with the elders\\"  <br />The meaning would lost outside of a cultural context in which people eat with their hands from a common vessel. (People do not eat like that anymore in modern Igboland. Everyone has his or her own plate). The meaning is that competence or paying one's dues trumps seniority, but it could have other shades of meaning in other situations.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Green Day's newest release, \\"American Idiot\\" has many things to please both old and new fans.  The title track boasts such politically incorrect phrases as \\"Now listen to the sound of the stereo The subliminal mind- f*ck America\\".  However, once you get past track 1, there isn't much good stuff left on the CD.  There are some songs that you just know are going to go big (and some already have, like the ballad \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and the thought-provoking \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\") and there are a few songs that sound cool (i.e. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Give Me Novocaine\\") but there isn't much other than that.  \\"American Idiot\\", I thought, was going to be an album I would keep listening to.  Boy was I wrong.
B0000784XP|5.0|I strongly believe that Tunde, the main singer in the group is one of the best singers of all time if not the best! This might sound crazy but he has a different voice from anybody else, he has the whole package. And his friend Paul is the cherry on top of the cake, toghether they are flawless. Timeless music that will never end. Ocean drive, Lifted and high are my favourite songs of all time. You need to listen to there music, this CD is superb. I recommend this to anybody who likes a good tune to there songs. <br /> <br />thanks for viewing my review.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I have always like American music, even when I hated American doo-wappy-bing-bang policies. Johnny Cash is the utmost American musician: Dark, lonely hero, saying what is true. It is something raw and hard and bold. That's what I go to American music to get, and this man does it most.

B000B5IPLK|5.0|Give it up for Alicia Keys!  This is one hell of a CD.  I was wondering where the Unplugged CDs had went from MTV.  The last one I really heard was the one from Jay-Z like 4 years ago.  Now that it is back, they came back hard.  Alicia Keys sparkles with her live performance put on CD.  She is truly one of the best put together artists in the business.  She has such beauty, she is musically a genius, very talented, and seems like a very good and genuine person.  All of which show on the CD including the guest spots she has on her ranging from different genres.  The CD has all the favorites on their in my view from Fallin' (if not my favorite of hers' which was her first hit as everyone knows, it's most def top two or three), Diary (right there with Fallin'), If I Ain't Got You, A Woman's Worth, How Come You Don't Call Me, and You Don't Know My Name as well as Karma.  But it also has some new jewels and gems on there as well.  Everyone who hears this album will love the new cuts Unbreakable and Stolen Moments.  They really give the CD even more newness and breaths of freshness if you should ever get tired of the singles of the last few years.  The track Wild Horses with Adam Levine (Maroon 5- I need to take a listen to their music some time) is a standout as well.   Whoever has seen Alicia Keys live, I sort of envy you a little.  If this CD is any indication of what she is like in concert, I hope to get the chance to see her and it one of these days.  The music, the way she plays, her voice and the background players and singers all blend nicely and she sounds so lovely.  The CD makes you feel like you're there in a way.  Alicia Keys Unplugged, truly a great buy in '05!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|WOW !  Batman has finally arrived on the big screen.     This movie really deserves a sixth star for sending all previous versions to an early retirement and hopefully their final resting place.     Try to forget all the goofy,spoofy and fluffy batman movies of the past - this one finally tells the story the way it was intended, dark with realism so long over-due that it will have you believing in heroes again.  A must see movie that will entertain adults as well as children.  I was absolutely convinced that Christian Bale is Batman - SUPERB !     Buy it!!!
B0006213WG|4.0|I have been a SUM 41 fan from the beginning and i think that these guys are the best band ever, alongside the band called MEST. the thing is, CHUCK is a brilliant album, but it starts to get a bit boring after a while, whereas their earlier work dosen't get boring! DOES THIS LOOK INFECTED, sum 41's album before chuck was brilliant and i can still listen to those songs and not get bored. i'm not saying that CHUCK is boring, but it could have been a bit better. also, the sound quality is pretty poor compared to DOES THIS LOOK INFECTED. i don't understand why deryck (the frontman) said that he wishes he could go back and change some of the songs on DOES THIS LOOK INFECTED, because, i think, if any album needs improving, it should be CHUCK.i know it sounds like i'm complaining and giving it a bad review, but i'm not! it is SUM 41 after all, and all their work is good! <br /> <br />INTRO/NO REASON: a great start to the CD,fast and catchy! 9/10 <br />WERE ALL TO BLAME: awesome! i love this song! 10/10 <br />ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES: good,different! 8/10 <br />SOME SAY: some say it is an oasis rip-off! 9/10 <br />THE BITTER END: nice solo, heavy! 10/10 <br />OPEN YOUR EYES: clever backing vocals! 9/10 <br />SLIPPING AWAY: short and sweet! 10/10 <br />I'M NOT THE ONE: sounds like linkin park a bit! 9/10 <br />WELCOME TO HELL: the weakest on the album! 7/10 <br />PIECES: an exellent ballad! best on album! 11/10 <br />THERE'S NO SOLUTION: the chorus is catchy as fu*k! 9/10 <br />88: one of the best, great ending! 10/10 <br />NOOTS: a good ending to an awesome album! 9/10 <br /> <br />as i say, the album is awesome, but there are weak points unlike the other three. i'm also sick of them thinking that they are big, and acting like celebrities just because they opened for metallica on the MTV ICON!! i still love this band, but i want the next record to be better! i have heard that the next album will be more like ALL KILLER, NO FILLER! i don't know if this is true, but it would be nice to see some more catchy pop-punk songs from SUM 41, because that is what i think they are best at doing! i think they are also getting a bit lazy! i think this because GOOD CHARLOTTE have started working on a new album now and the last one by them came out at the same time as CHUCK did, and i haven't heard of any news on a follow-up to CHUCK, apart from the thing about ALL KILLER, NO FILLER! i wish they would get a move on and get a new album out soon, because they need one! if you like sum 41's earlier stuff and blink 182,good charlotte then you will love MEST!! i promise you!! i have just reviewed their new album that came out the day before yesterday and given it 5/5! it is called PHOTOGRAPHS!!! the sound quality is excellent on PHOTOGRAPHS!!! obviously, it will be, because it is by the best producer in the world (JOHN FELDMAN)!!! HE IS A GREAT PRODUCER AND I'M AM SICK OF PEOPLE GIVING HIM GRIEF ALL THE TIME, AND SAYING THAT THE RECORDS HE HAS PRODUCED ARE OVER-PRODUCED!?! TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE... SHUT UP YOU BORING B*STARDS!!! HE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD!!! WAKE UP!!! BUY PHOTOGRAPHS NOW!!!  oh yeah, and BUY CHUCK TOO, it is cool!!! <br />
B000002UAF|5.0|Anyone who thinks the early Beatles were somehow immature or \\"lesser\\" compared to their later work simply needs to pick up this jaw-dropping album. Without a doubt it's one of their three greatest (The other two being Revolver and The Beatles, in my opinion), and I would even be open to arguments placing it at the top, though I personally wouldn't myself.    Realize: a little over a YEAR into their major-label career, in the wake of two #1 LPs and four consecutive #1 singles with current expectations to match, in the midst of a publicity crush the likes of which won't be seen again until Jesus returns, during a mindblowingly grueling touring schedule, AND while filming a motion picture, The Beatles ALSO found the time to put out a fully perfect album of 13 self-penned songs. The ONLY time Lennon and McCartney wrote all the songs for an album, in fact. The main triumph is Lennon's - he wrote 10 out of 13, including the title track and impressively mature gems like \\"If I Fell\\" and \\"I'll Be Back\\" - but when McCartney's three contributions are called \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" \\"And I Love Her,\\" and \\"Things We Said Today\\" the balance is redressed. A Hard Day's Night is the final word on early Sixties pop and, when you factor in the diamond-crushing pressure they were under at the time, also one of the most bravura performances in rock history.
B00000055E|5.0|It really sucks with Mr.Shakur long gone, no politics in Hip Hop / Rap!?  Shakur was a better activist than Public Enemy or Cube, the true thug'd out Outlaw, it also sucks with Eazy & Big Poppa being gone aswell. I would like to also point out to you that I have a broad taste in hip-hop, I do also like many of the rappers you point to, as do many Tupac fans, so maybe it is you that is ignorant. Biggie has an amazing flow, but his lyrics are average, and he never really raps about anything meaningful. Nas is, in my opinion the greatest lyricist ever, I love NWA as well, but none of them had the charisma and presence Tupac had. As for him contradicting himself, you don't think he noticed that? Everyone contradicts themselves, he wasn't afraid to show it either, because he said what was on his mind at the time. Have you ever listened to his lyrics, he genuinely believed that women should be treated with respect, yet on the other hand it conflicted with the one night stands he had (listen to Temptations on Me Against The World). He was the realest to ever pick up the mic, and not just that he was also a well above average lyricist, anyone who says otherwise is talking s**t. Buy Me Against The World and listen to him at his lyrical peak, he was not wack, I can only assume that you attack him because of what he said to Biggie. Get over it, the beef died when they both died, it was 10 years ago, I feel sorry for people like you who can't appreciate both of their music. this album isn't his best but is still a good one but needs some work.  The joint Open Fire featuring Scarface is a heavy hitting joint by our beloved Pac, Hellrazor featuring Stretch & Val Young is another tight joint about stress in the projects & sparking up dubs, Nothin' But Love featuring Dave Hollister is a tight block party Bay area song about drinking Hennessey, smoking on some Dope & Hustlin' & my very favorite When I Get Free II featuring Outlawz is a phat joint thats just Krazy & has the best beat!<br /><br />Shakur's greatest joints 4 Disc. 1 are 1, *2, 3, *4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 & 13.<br /><br />Shakur's greatest joints 4 Disc. 2 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, *8, 9, 10, *11 & 13, oh yeah (R.I.P.).! <br /> <br />Shakur's greatest joints 4 Disc. 1 are 1, *2, 3, *4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 & 13. <br /> <br />Shakur's greatest joints 4 Disc. 2 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, *8, 9, 10, *11 & 13, oh yeah (R.I.P.). <br /> <br />
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|by Ty Hedegard. <br /> <br />A man named Paul Crewe (played by Adam Sandler) was an NFL quarterback. Paul Crewe was sent to Maximum Security Prison for resisting arrest and stealing his girlfriend's car. While serving time, Paul Crewe had to set up a football team and play against the warden's team. <br /> <br />I liked The Longest Yard because the action is so great. Paul Crewe stealing the car and getting the football team together was <br />exciting; the game was the best. <br /> <br />Another one was the drama. When the inmates would die or get hurt the coaches and inmates would cry. The heart-touching parts were performed well. <br /> <br />And last but certainly not least was the comedy.... Some parts on here were very funny. When Paul Crewe and the coaches would pick someone then end up not liking the prisoners Paul Crewe said to the coaches would have to cut the big players if they needed it. <br /> <br /> If you're a person that likes action, drama, and comedy, then I would suggest that you get this movie!!
0743454537|1.0|This is the only book I've ever read that I felt negatively enough toward to give it a one-star review.<br /><br />I bought this on impulse because the description sounded fantastic. The idea on which the novel is based is brilliant. The writing, as I found out too late, is another story.<br /><br />Picoult writes like an adolescent schoolgirl who writes soppy stories just to go back and read them and think \\"ooh! I wrote that! It's really good!\\" Terrible metaphors, terrible romanticisms, terrible everything. Her characters are shallow and unreal, her situations unbelievable (really -- HONESTLY -- what parents of an eighteen-year-old would simply sit and do nothing if they knew for a fact he was taking all sorts of drugs -- on their own property? And that is just one example). Real people WOULD NOT do or say the things these characters do and say. I often laughed out loud at how self-aware and pretentious her writing is, and several times I had to put the book down and walk away because it was just too bad for me to handle. Also, she gives NO credit to her readers. I was not allowed to figure out anything for myself -- apparently she felt like she had to spell out every little point for me. What an insult.<br /><br />A long time ago I made a pact with myself that I'd finish every book I started. Jodi Picoult, I applaud you. You, after all these years and literally hundreds of novels, have forced me to break that pact.<br /><br />Stay away. There are so, so many GOOD books out there.
B00004W510|5.0|Some albums are declared \\"dated\\" or \\"timeless\\" based on particular qualities (lyrics, instrumentation, production gimmickry) that either trap them in cultural amber or leave them curiously unscathed by musical faddishness. But The Band's eponymous second LP (now reissued with greatly improved sound, penetrating liner notes, and some decent but inessential bonus tracks) is that rarest of things: an album that exists OUTSIDE of time, or rather *in* but not *of* it.     Let me explain.  This disc was written, recorded and released in 1969, but could just as plausibly have come from 1869. The songs (gorgeously played slices of Americana, all) do indeed speak of certain historical events - Stoneman's raids and a visit from General Robert E. Lee near the end of the Civil War in \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\" to name one, the coming of rural trade unionism in \\"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\\" to name another - but the music and performance stands eerily outside the continuum of actual CHRONOLOGICAL time, and instead gestures towards a permanent, idealized near-mythical imagining of American history.     It's rather amazing, really: Robbie Robertson and his cohorts, having fully absorbed the American folk tradition, have reorganized it as an impressionistic snapshot history of the United States in sepia-tone.  Given the preternatural way in which every single song on the album fully and flawlessly evokes American folk images and myths while simultaneously remaining effortlessly modern - again, a product of its times but still not of them - it's either deeply ironic or perfectly predictable that this most American of albums was written and performed by four Canadians (plus one Razorback). I'm still not sure which.    What IS beyond doubt, however, is that The Band is a landmark in the history of modern American music, and one which the group themselves could never live up to in later years. It is one of the very few albums I've ever owned that has a palpable aura and mystique; absorb it in all of its impossible perfection and you will feel like a magic spell is being worked upon you. To embrace the sweet cadences of \\"Rockin' Chair,\\" to join in singing the ragged communal harmonies of \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\\" or to plunge into the darting guitar figures which represent the deceptive moral choice posited by \\"King Harvest\\"...to do these things is to delve into the joyful enigmas of the United States' own founding myths.     History as mystery. Not bad for an 11-song piece of vinyl, really.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Exploding into the USA charts in early 1967 with two incredibly powerful singles, \\"Somebody to Love\\" & \\"White Rabbit\\", Jefferson Airplane were the most commercially successful of all the \\"new wave\\" San Francisco groups for good reason: they could play, they could sing, and they could write unforgettably good songs. And \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\", from which both singles were drawn, shows just how impressive they were before success and group politics took their toll.  <br /> <br />Opening with the magnificent \\"She Has Funny Cars\\" - with its, for the time, bizarre song structure, driving drums & guitars, and wonderful vocal interactions between Grace Slick & Marty Balin - the album is an almost perfect example of everything that was good about \\"hippie\\" music. Moving effortlessly between progressive rock (\\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\\" & \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\"), wistful introspection (\\"Today\\", \\"Embryonic Journey\\" & \\"Coming Back to Me\\") and barrier bending innovation (\\"She Has Funny Cars\\", \\"D.C.B.A. - 25\\" & \\"White Rabbit\\") it captured a group at the peak of their powers, born out of and immersed in a world where they were encouraged to push their music into totally new areas. And underpinning it all is the \\"atmosphere\\" of San Francisco in its fleeting period when hippie ideals really were musically relevant... nothing from the Airplane, or indeed any of their San Francisco contemporaries, caught the feel of the time & place as well as \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" and, like all classic albums, it remains as interesting and listenable today as it did all those years ago.     <br />
B000088DTS|5.0|This album is put together of tons of great songs <br />Innocent eues and predictable are my favorites <br />but the entire album is great set with catchy songs <br />I would recommend this album to anyone that loves <br />pop songs with a great voice singing them.
0895260131|1.0|To some one looking for answers it may seem that this book has all you need to know about the real Islam. Yet if if you knew anything about the quran and the way that its verses were revealed, you might know better. All verses in the quran were revealed according to different situations in Islam during Muhhammads life. The way these verses are portrayed are made to make them seem to apply to all aspects of life which is completely false. It seems that some people can take verses out of context and people will believe it in its still seemingly corrupt form. I can assure you this book has some true statements from the Quran, but none of which are explained with or given the true meaning and relevant purpose of which a muslim knows god had clearly intended and revealed.  <br /> <br />You can read this book or take it from a true Muslim, but that is your choice
B00005JO0J|5.0|No need to delve into the plot; others have done it already. I was reading the various reviews but when I clicked on \\"Read all reviews\\", all I got was a white screen and the movie poster! What gives?  I wanted to see if anyone else caught the \\"Forbidden Planet\\" tribute. I had to explain it to my friends because I chuckled at a tense moment and they couldn't understand why. If you missed it, when the crew is on planet Miranda they enter the laboratory where they discover the terrible secret being hid by the Alliance. On the outside and on the walls of the lab (I'm uncertain if this was a building or a vessle) it is marked \\"C57D\\". This is the registration number of the star ship from \\"Forbidden Planet\\", which also is a double entendre (sorry if I misspelled it, I haven't studied French since 1970) for Miranda being a 'forbidden planet'. Well, I got a kick out of it just the same. If you liked the film, go see it again and again; take friends to see it. Let them view the series so they can fully enjoy the experience. For those of you who thought it sucked... Well, that's why we live in a democracy. To the cast & crew and to Joss Whedon-- \\"Great job! Can't wait for the next thrilling ride.\\"
B00005JO0J|5.0|This was just a very fun movie to watch. Even if you have never seen the short-lived TV series, you will still enjoy this film. I would love to see this come back to TV, to allow more focus on each of the characters. Each is very entertaining and regretably couldn't be given time on screen that they deserved. Wish there were more movies made like this one.
B000B7HZXM|3.0|Rod Stewart's raspy and unusual voice has been interesting to me since \\"Maggie May\\" in the 70's. Who would've thought that he could ever pull off a series of pop standards that would produce four CD's of such classic and enduring compositions? Not I. That's what makes his foray into this genre so pleasant. <br /> <br />One of the other reasons the CD is so pleasing is that these old songs hold up lyrically (with very few exceptions). It's wonderful to hear songs that are currently being recorded that refer to love and loss in classicly romantic language. No \\"droppin' it like it's hot and backin' up that thing\\" on this presentation. Here, the overt reference to sexual expression is deferred for the sensibilities of the 40's and 50's. These songs were composed when lyricists had to use imagination a versatile vocabulary and subltle reference to impart a beautiful thought and a musical message. Thank goodness and Clive Davis of J Records for taking us on a sentimental journey. <br /> <br />Rod's weather worn voice is indeed perfectly suited for many of these songs. More than a few of them were originally recorded by women in their heydays. Artists like Sarah Vaughn, Peggy Lee, Jo Stafford and others wrapped their silky and versatile vocals around such sensuous lyrics to make these hits the standards they are. A smoother or more refind voice would not have played as well with such vulnerable and feminine lyrics. Rod's raspy turn at these gems lends believability and finesse to his interpretations. <br /> <br />There are some problems. On occasion Rod struggles with his voice needing to be as fluid as it should be (Long Ago and Far Away). On other times his mispronunciation of words (Is your figure less than greek) in \\"My Funny Valentine\\" is almost stunning; leaving you to wonder why noone corrected this blatancy. But all in all I found the CD very enjoyable and worth the cash spent. <br /> <br />My favorites on this project are; \\"I Wish You Love\\". Which is beautifully expressive and convincing. \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\" is an inspired pairing between Mr. Stewart and Miss Ross. Diana's voice is a perfect match for Rod's on this one. She should take a cue from Rod and return to the jazzy blues standards she did in the seventies. It might jumpstart a new phase in her career. \\"Taking A Chance On Love\\" is fun and spirited.  <br />Chaka Khan's duet with Rod is a little bit too over produced for this CD. Towards the end of the song she is harmonizing with herself (On a DUET?!?) and she ends the song with a jazz inspired mumble. Too much.  <br /> <br />I sincerely hope this is not the last of the series as I've read Rod has stated. Just one more time please. Rod, just consider it an encore.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|For a relatively obscure film, \\"Butterfly\\" has stimulated a lot of discourse and counter opinions.  Reviewers' descriptors include: romantic, entertaining, mystery, sleaze, violent, thriller, dark, psychological, horror, sinister, time travel, evil, scientific, disturbing, etc.  These come from both favorable and unfavorable reviews. <br /> <br />To understand Butterfly, one has to understand what the \\"butterfly effect\\" is; otherwise the viewer will be sorely disappointed.  The official editorial reviewer, Shannon, points to \\"Jurassic Park\\" for edification, but that's nonsense; don't waste your time there. <br /> <br />Without going into detail, the butterfly effect is a very real scientific postulation that includes elements of chaos theory, non-linear differential equations, and how infinitesimal differences in initial conditions can drastically change outcomes.  Specifically, the butterfly effect refers to how the action of a butterfly in one part of the world might have unexpected but profound effects on weather systems half way around the globe.  Sounds absurd (like many found the movie), but it is an accepted theory in the scientific community.  I recommend \\"Chaos\\" by Gleick for a clear and understandable explanation of the effect, and for a general understanding of chaos theory. <br /> <br />If I had no understanding of the butterfly effect, I would have panned the movie too.  On the other hand, I found Butterfly to be a provocative interpretation. <br />
B000002G7E|5.0|I Have Been a fan of the Velvet Underground ever since I've heard their debut album,\\"The Velvet Underground & Nico\\", but nothing could prepare me for this.  White Light/White Heat is without a doubt one of,\\"if not\\", the most loudest and out of control record ever produced.  As Soon as you here the opening title track you know the group has left the halfway secured environment of the debut album and have entered the world of abrasive proto-punk and raunchy experimental rock.  The second track is like an evil explicit version of a Bob Dylan folk song, telling the dark story of a man who ships himself to his exlover in a cardboard box.  I don't want to spoil the demented ending to that song.  The next two tracks actually have somewhat of a melody.  There're two of the shorter tracks on the album but are still very memorable.  Then comes side two.  Things explode with the track,\\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\", with it's audible assualt and featuring some of Lou Reed's best guitar playing.  Then comes one of the biggest climaxes in rock history,\\" Sister Ray\\".  I've heard songs such as The Doors,\\"The End\\", and Pink Floyd's,\\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", and I thought those were crazy and out of control but this tops them all.  The song tells a story of drugs, explicit sex images and images of crime and murder in a epic seventeen minute jam featuring some of the most unbelievable and insane guitar and organ work ever featured on a record.  To dimiss this as just noise is a usual and understandable conception.  This album is not for everybody.  You need to be prepared for the assualt not just on your ears but on your whole idea of music.  If your looking for something new and thrilling, track down this record and buy it.  You will be treated to some of the most incredible sounds in the history of music.
B000006TRV|5.0|With apologies to Freddie Mercury, Elton John, Aerosmith and Rush; The Wall is the Best Album Ever Made. Curl up in bed with your lover and listen to this entire offering without interruption. Have the room dim enough so your eyes don't get bothered by reading the books on your nightstand or shelf. Let this music seep into you and you will be a changed person. This music kept me from killing myself 20 years ago. I hope it helps you as well.

0312323859|5.0|I already had my presupposed feelings towards Darcy Rhone. Plain and simple ... I hated her. I didn't have any compassion towards her when she suffered through her losses, and I certainly didn't expect that I would even want to try and understand why she was the way she was. But SOMETHING BLUE changed my views completely.<br /><br />This book is an extraordinary sequel that beautifully catalogs the positive transformation of a young woman lost. I may be making this book seem deeper than it probably may seem to many readers, but to me it was an emotional journey. I ended up loving Darcy more than any character I have come across in books that I have read.<br /><br />SOMETHING BLUE picks up right where SOMETHING BORROWED left off... So for that reason alone you MUST read the first book before you read the second... There are no shortcuts with this series - but the story is SO GOOD that it will be a breeze!<br /><br />We open up to find Darcy pregnant (as a result of her own unfaithfulness) and alone with nowhere to turn. These unfortunate circumstances don't falter her selfish and self-absorbed attitude one bit. Instead it heightens these characteristics. Except this time she has no one there to accept it.<br />So, she decides to take a little vacation where she will stay/live in London with her childhood friend Ethan. This move takes her through some life changes and allows her to evaluate her life and the turn that it has taken.<br /><br />Honestly this is one  of the best books I have read this year, and you don't have to be a chick-lit lover to enjoy it. It's for anyone who appreciated a GREAT story! Emily Giffin has really outdone herself!
B0006L5RT2|4.0|There's nothing insane about James Blunt's first Album.  It's beautifully constructed and designed to appeal to a wide range of potential listeners.  I must fit into this range because it appealed to me big time.  Yes the production is slick (but never overdone), but the end result is an album that is versatile and very listenable. If you like this genre of music (and I do) you'll definitley like this one.
B000AL730O|3.0|First of all, mccartney is the greatest songwriter, performer ever.  (eg. just review his catalog of great songs).  However, this CD is NOT mccartney at his best. (seems like hes too busy to pulish a song or to improve lyrics)  If you want top-of-the-line CD check out flaming pie.  There are 3 songs on the album that are worth the full price tho : Jenny Wrench, Fine line and Something in her eyes.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|How much do I like Firefly?  So far I've bought 3----or is it 4----copies of the series on DVD, but I keep \\"losing\\" them.  It always starts the same way.....someone says something about the movie, like, \\"Oh, it's okaaaay, but I don't see what the big deal is....\\"  Next thing I know, I've given up trying to explain the whole series to them, and hand my copy over.  And that's the last I see of it.  *sigh*
0385338686|5.0|It was so good to read another Sophie Kinsella novel... It was like bumping into an old friend while touring a strange country! Of course, I don't think any of her novels will top the Shopaholic Series (classics!) but THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS was funny and refreshing all the same!<br /><br />Attorney Samantha Sweeting has just gotten herself in quite a pickle! While cleaning her messy -- but maintained -- desk, she comes across a mistake that could potentially end her career. This blunder causes her to breakdown with no clue of what to do... So she takes the easy way out. She walks straight out of the office without explanation and gets on  the next train that will take her far away from this nightmare.<br /><br />And from there... the plot thickens... the high-powered lawyer manages to turn into a high-powered ...housekeeper? It may sound like an outlandish twist, but Kinsella makes it work, without failing to blend in her supreme sense of humor and awe-inspiring style of writing that will keep you quickly turning those pages.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended. Cheers to Sophie Kinsella for always keeping it fresh!
B000AA305M|4.0|I first heard songs from this Album whilst travelling around the UK and Ireland and was hooked enough to buy it. The standout track (if you like the commercially viable) is The One I Love, but there are several other really good tracks including Slow Motion and Ain't No Love.  The latter seems to have shades of Neil Diamond and (towards the end) Chris De Burgh - an interesting mix! <br /> <br />Overall this CD is just so easy to listen to that I find myself playing it all the time <br /> <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I must confess, for many years, Dream Theater fell off my radar screen.  \\"Images and Words\\" came out my senior year of high school and I rushed out to buy it after hearing \\"Pull Me Under\\".  Being a Rush fan my entire life, I loved the synthesis the band acheived between progressive rock and metal. I still have and enjoyed listening to that CD, but never paid much attention to the band again. <br />  Back in July, while at my local library, I came across this CD, I said, oh, this might be intersting.  I've been listening to it almost everyday since. <br />   Most people who like progressive rock find themselves taken into the hypnotic trance rhythm patterns, and songs like \\"Never Eough\\" and \\"Panic attack\\" will constantly play in your head. <br />  My favorite piece is probably \\"These Walls\\"  I love the title track, and I can never just listen to one song, I listen to the whole CD.  The only song I do not care for is \\"I walk Beside You\\" which sounds like U2, who I cannot stand.  Octavarium is just an incredible piece of music, and it has re-ignited my interest in the band so much that I am now also listening to \\"Train of Thought\\"  I cannot decide which CD I like better.  Train of Thought seems more metallish, while Octavarium is more progressive.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I was so intrigued by reading everyone's reviews of this little show that could...that I had to order the complete Season of Firefly on DVD from Amazon. I was, and still am in love with the creativity,  the originality and the clever 'not-so-cliche-ness' of it all. The show was great... So when I heard there was a feature film called \\"Serenity\\"in the works, I was very excited.<br /><br />The movies feels like an enormous, well-budgeted mini series.. which is what I love about it most. The cast, visibly made 'more Hollywood' was superb in continuing the story that made this a cult favorite. From the very original story arc, to teh fantastic workings of the digital effects team... this movie is so much closer to the target when it comes to quality science fiction. A certain director of another 'war in space' set of movies.. could take notes.<br />Please see this movie, love this movie, and own it when it comes to DVD. It is a forever favorite of mine.<br /><br />P.S.<br />My only dissapointment.. why kill Shepard and Wash?
B000B5QWKG|2.0|Over the past year or so I've danced around buying Franz Ferdinand's stuff. What I heard on the radio from the first album was okay, but I felt it still wasn't quite \\"there,\\" like the first album of a great band that was still waiting to find their sound. When I heard cuts from the new album, however, I was very excited to get the disc and was looking forward to becoming a Franz Ferdinand addict.<br /><br />The good news is that there's some solid work on this CD. \\"Do You Want To\\", \\"This Boy\\", \\"Evil and a Heathen\\", \\"You're the Reason I'm Leaving,\\" \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On,\\" and \\"I'm Your Villain\\" all make the price of the album worthwhile, evoking a weird mixture between 1960s surf and early 80s punk. Although the album suffers a bit from a bit too much \\"sameness\\" from one cut to the next, it's a highly listenable outing for a second album.<br /><br />Now comes the bad news, which is the reason this album got two instead of four stars. If you do the majority of your music listening with a portable music player like an iPod, then be prepared for the fact that Franz Ferdinand's publishers have decided they don't want you to legally buy their product and make it convenient for you to enjoy. This disc won't play on most computers, which means you can't pull the songs into iTunes, which means it never gets onto your iPod. If you're like me, if it doesn't get onto your iPod, you may never get around to listening to it because you don't want to have to haul around the 100s of CDs you own. It's the twenty first century, and it's knuckle-dragging-STUPID to expect people go BACK to having to lug around huge CD cases in their cars because of patently moronic copy protection schemes. Don't these publishers realize that junk like this will only encourage the piracy of the music they're trying to protect! The idiots at their label behind this scheme need to be lined up and shot.
B000000I0Q|5.0|1975's \\"Voyage Of The Acolyte\\" was the debut solo album for Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett, recorded two years before he left the band. In my opinion, \\"Voyage Of The Acolyte\\" remains his best solo work to date. \\"Acolyte\\" is an absolutely gorgeous album, with Steve magically weaving rock with classical, creating a perfect prog-rock palette of moods, feelings, and sounds. The album also boasts excellent production & phenomenal musicianship, not only from Steve (whose guitar work here is sensational) but also from his Genesis co-horts Mike Rutherford on bass and Phil Collins on drums, and his brother John Hackett on flute. Powerful rockers include \\"Ace Of Wands,\\" \\"A Tower Struck Down\\" and the closing section of \\"Shadow Of The Hierophant,\\" while \\"Star Of Sirius\\" (featuring lead vocals from Phil) is wonderful prog-pop. Exquisitely beautiful pieces include \\"Hands Of The Priestess Parts I & II,\\" \\"The Hermit\\" (with lead vocals by Steve) and the opening section of \\"Hierophant,\\" with a lovely vocal by Sally Oldfield. \\"Voyage Of The Acolyte\\" is Steve Hackett's masterpiece, an album that sounds just as fresh now as it did 30 years ago. No diehard fan of Steve's or Genesis or progressive rock in general should do without it.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I just recently watched \\"Snatch\\" for the first time & totally loved it!!!  Def. one of my fav. movies, went out and bought it right away (well, actually i borrowed it from a friend and never returned it..haha!) but anywayz, very interesting plot line, cool sequence of scenes..skips around a lot like a Tarentino flick.  But all it's own, very original with a perfect cast.  You must check this out!!!!
B000009ED0|5.0|Kid Rock is one of the most infamous and overlooked artists of all time. Much other white artists out of Detroit such as ICP, people have heard one song by him and judged immediately. If you ask anyone nowadays to name a song by Kid Rock they would either say Cowboy or Bawitdaba. This proves most people haven't really looked into the talent of this performer. Kid Rock never got the respect that he deserves, and where I live, he is pretty much treated like crap. I am the one who stands up for him when people say \\"Kid Rock is gay.\\" This is Kid Rock's first CD that actually got some copies sold. Kid was way ahead of his time, making this. It sounds like something like RUN DMC because he chose to mix rap with metal and rock with hip hop. Doing so, he made a great CD that is still overlooked today. As any fan can probably see, Kid ROck has got more mature by every album until eventually, instead of one ballad like \\"Only God Knows Why\\" he has a whole CD full of them. I really think every song on this CD was fantastic.
B000AL730O|4.0|'u?'?extreme good fortune to see Sir Paul perform last night. Somehow hearing the new stuff live made it work for me. I think this is one of those albums that improve over time, requiring some gentle use before it fits right.<br /><br />There is a Victorian charm to \\"English Garden\\" that I find compelling despite its obvious silliness. \\"Fine Line\\" is a great little single as well.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I did not even look at the song selecting for this album. However, I believe one of the most amazing things about Pink Floyd was their abillity to put together an album. To buy a greatest hits CD is missing a very important side of the Pink Floyd spectrum of talent. Buy Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall if you want to get some hits, then buy the rest of their albums. This is of course unless you are poor, in which case you should buy this.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Why the hell do all those pretend-gangsta's on MTV Cribs show off their copy of Scarface?  It costs like $17.99 for the dvd, most hobo's could scrape together 18 bucks in a few weeks, so what are you guys trying to prove?  Besides, all the Gangster's in this flick are white guys and light skinned hispanics!  How do you relate to this so much?  Why are they so obsessed with al pacino?  He's italian for f***'s sake!  Haven't you seen New Jack City, the brothers can't stand those linguini eatin' fools!  Wake up!  So next time, show off your copy of Menace to Society or Juice!  But anyways, all that aside, this movie is totally badass.  And no, i'm not racist.  I'm just pointing this out.  peace

The great amount of noises makes D-Mode sound very Industrial, although the mellow lyrics and melodies are still there.  Highlights are (surprisely) Dave Gahan's first tunes for D-Mode ( \\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"Nothing's Impossible\\") and the beautiful upbeated \\"Lilian\\" from Martin Gore's melodies Arsenal.

Each pattern covered has 30 or 40 pages devoted to it as an example task is described (i.e. managing the creation of pizzas in various cities), problems come up, and are solved elegantly.  This is the book you should read after you read Design Patterns. <br /> <br />One minor quibble-- they suggest double-checked locking as a way to manage Singleton creation in a concurrent environment. Even though it works in Java 5.0, it's still ugly (uses volatile) and unnecessary. Synchronized is much faster than it used to be, so what's the point?
B0009K7RTI|4.0|Well, I think plenty have said what they think of the movie here and I'll just skip that part.  Obviously, if you like ND, you'll like the UMD.<br /><br />Three things you should know about the UMD version of ND are:<br /><br />1. All it has for bonus features is some trailers. Boo.<br /><br />2. The new ketchup-packet menu animations are REALLY cool.<br /><br />3. Audio sounds fine, but the video suffers from a common UMD problem I've noticed: wash-out.  Blacks aren't black enough and the movie feels a little too \\"grey\\" as a result.<br /><br />Far from unwatchable, a good-enough version of ND on UMD.
B00005LANG|5.0|Excellent record!  This music is timeless and will never get old.  It's def. feel good music that will uplift you and set a peaceful vibe!
1559409010|5.0|I have just read an article by someone on this website, who suggested burning every copy of this film, because it is 'dirty' and 'evil'. Firstly, burining this film would be like burning the Bible. And secondly, this person should stop being so incredibly sad. GET A LIFE, A PERSONALITY AND A SENSE OF HUMOUR WHILST YOUR AT IT! This is a fantastic film that should go down in history for it's exciting and witty respresentation of the story of Jesus. No-one should take any offense in the film and call it sacreligious as it is so funny and zany, it goes beyond the level at which you can take offense! I mean, come on. There is one scene in whcih the title role, Brian (played very well by Graham Chapman)is inadvertantly abducted by aliens and taken for a ride around the cloar system. Any one that can not see that this is just a film that runs along the same lines of the story of Jesus, and not one that it is a piss-take, should take a good hard look at themselves and all other films set in the Roman era. Are they blasthemous for being in the same time zone? If so, take a deep breath and 'look on the bright side of life!!!'    And for God's sake, I'm 13 and I can even spell and write better than the person that wrote the 'evil' review. Maybe that isn't such a coincidence!    Oh and also, I'd just like to add that over here in the U.K, this film won 'Best Comedy Film Ever' recently. So shove that up your pipes and smoke it all you people that said no-one likes it!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys.  One of, if not the best female artist in the world.  On The Diary of Alicia Keys, she puts her heart and sould into every song.  The vibes and beats are unbelievable.  If I Ain't Got You is one of the best songs that I have ever heard, having written this entirelly herself, Alicia really won me over with this song.  You Dont Know My Name gives you a slight, slight taste of Alicia's acting ability, which you can see more of in her If I Aint Got You Video, or in the Feature Film she is starring in, due out sometime soon (???).  Karma is another great one, with a hot beat and powerful lyrics.  Wake up is also one of the better songs on the album with more powerful lyrics and a great beat.  All in all Alicia Keys 2nd album into her career is a must have.  Highly reccomended.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Forget Mariah Carey,X-tina has the REAL voice and the right material to sell records.She doesn't scream like Mariah does,Chris truly sings from her heart.This album is Christina's latest and Christina's best to date.Her voice ain't irritating like some other artists.All the songs are great but my favorites are Can't Hold Us Down feat.Lil' Kim,Walk Away(this song shows you the powerful voice that's Christina),Fighter,Infactuation,Impossible,Beautiful,Make Over,Dirrty and the Voice Within.Christina Aguilera is the best POP singer out there.

B00005JL1C|5.0|I first saw this movie on TV as a college student. I loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on VHS tape. I have watched this movie so many times I'm surprised the VHS tape is still working! <br /> <br />The actors are perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene. <br /> <br />The characters are not glossy, and that is what I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years. <br /> <br />If you're looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack, this is your type of movie.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is made in the manor of a clasic science pulp fiction novel. The movie is presented in a yellowish black and white format that gives it the feeling of a very old film. The story line is a clasic good guy vs the evil Nazi mad doctor. As such, the movie is best suited if you are looking for the ambiance.
B0000DYKET|5.0|Even though these shoes are a bit expensive, I have never purchased a more comfortable or durable pair of shoes. Tough as nails. I have been using mine on a daily bassis for the past 18 months. I walk atleast 5 miles a day. Still holding up perfectly except for normal wear.  <br /> <br />
B000AXSN5G|5.0|A Neil young album is like a leather jacket.  It takes some getting used to, it might seem a little too shiny at first, you have to break it in, and once you do, you begin to realize that you never want to let it go.  That's how I feel about Prairie Wind....  At first, I was a little put off, those horns seemed a tad corny, the choir singers a little out of place.  But after several (okay, maybe twenty) run throughs, I began to see the utter magic of this album..  Simplistic complexity...  \\"No Wonder\\" stands out like another \\"Dangerbird\\" - the chord changes and hooks invite you, indeed pull you, into Neil's wonderful world of juxtapositions.  I love the line, \\"Somewhere a senator sits in his leather chair, behind his wooden desk.  The caribou he killed mean nothing to him, he took his money just like all the rest...\\"  Classic Neil.  The album radiates Neil's wonder with the world, the haunting, Jack Nitzsche-esque \\"It's a dream\\" paints some incredible and touching pictures.  You get the feeling that Neil thought that THIS was very possibly his last album (not counting his archives).  Thank god, we have him for sometime to come -- he is a treasure.  Oh, and by all means watch the DVD, not only is the sound quality better -- you get to see what everyone put into this effort...
B0000CDLA7|5.0|First let me tell you to read in full the first spotlight reviewer named: Mr D. \\"Artist/Designer/Kibitzer\\" <br /> <br />Mr. D has very good info about this DT release!  <br /> <br />Overall this effort TOT is very solid and in your face with lots of aggression (for Dream Theater anyways). It is a departure from their usual sound but not so much that your typical DT fan can't digest. This may not be the best DT release but it is essential to have if you like the band a fair amount. Listen to the samples to get a good idea and then make your choice from there as to how big a fan you are of this band and this album. Some complaints about this cd have been that the lead guitars just keep noodling around without much feeling and in fact gives the feeling that he's simply trying to show off how fast he can pick his guitar. this may seem to be true to some extent but who cares. It's still Dream Theater afterall and it's a very consistent listen. And if you don't like it then just sell your used copy here on Amazon or give it to someone who cares. <br /> <br />Not to be missed in my humble opinion.
B000068IEU|4.0|One of the most violent films ever commited to film, Craven's debut is visceral, shocking, nasty, taboo-breaking, and unforgivable all at the same time. While the quality of the film isn't his best (certainly there are better Craven top quality movies), LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is more a study of repressed violence in America. David Hess's character is terrifying, nasty, and downright corrupt. I despised his character the most, but he was also very good in the part. The two girls who were ultimately killed in the movie are also good in their roles for the most part, but David Hess just steals the show. The death of the girls are unbelievably violent, especially Phyllis who was stabbed over and over until they virtually were taking out her intestines (just disgusting). David Hess certainly got what was coming to him in the end, but the ending of the film isn't all flowers and candy by any means.  <br /> <br />While flawed in screen quality and somewhat the story, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is a good debut for Craven, and he would show his true flair, especially on A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. But to truly see where he began, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is an introduction to the madness that is Wes Craven. He is one of the most respected horror film directors, and this movie is a starting point to that career.
B000002U9Y|4.0|This is actually a great release if you can stomach all the experiMENTAL sounds on this one! At first listen I thought this cd was kinda corny on some songs, but once I thought about the era that this was first released I was able to more clearly see where the Floyd was coming from with this and what they were trying to do. Psychadelic hippie rock at it's most glorious!! <br /> <br />It's groovy, hip in a hippy way, and I think the song See-Saw is even talking about a boy who loves his sister a little too much? Hmmm....interesting stuff. But overall, this is still a fun disc to turn once in a while and pretend you are kicking it in the 60's! <br /> <br />This is mainly for die hard PF fans like myself or for someone who wants to re-live the 60's in some way.
B00005ASOI|5.0|I remember when I watched the Bravo 100 Scariest Movie Moments and seeing Suspiria at #24 and, having never seen it but having seen other Argento releases, I decided to give it a chance. I purchased the unrated edition which definitely has the feel of one, and I was not at all disappointed. The only thing that I was slightly disappointed by was there wasn't enough of that creepy woman in the end, but that's really what makes Suspiria a just-about-classic movie.  <br /> <br />The movie is about a young American girl who is going off to a school in Germany to study dance and theater, but boy does this girl get more than she bargained for in this film. The opening 20 minutes of Suspiria are stylish, creepy, and downright classic, and it's just as great that the rest of the film remains as strong. You can feel the suspense; you can feel the terror; you can see the colors of the make-up and blood are almost too realistic, which just adds to the tense horror. Suspiria is probably most remembered for its opening sequence where one of the short-lived characters (a student) enters her bathroom to freshen up and she hears creepy noises from outside. Out of nowhere, a set of creepy eyes appear and then a hand smashes into the room from outside and the poor girl is pounded into the window and then snatched outside and we never see the killer, but we see horrible things happen in a beautiful way (much like Blood and Black Lace). The ending of the film is mysterious and strong, but ultimately, SUSPIRIA is too.  <br /> <br />Argento would go on to help produce such films as DEMONS, DEMONS 2, and a re-version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA that isn't quite as memorable. But with SUSPIRIA, Argento continued the great tradition of excellent work he had already mastered with PHENOMENA.
B000021XS0|5.0|......Yeah, this is a 5 star release and it shouldn't be any surprise to find mostly great reviews on this cd. This album flows extremely well for a concept album and there are many who consider this DT's best work. It's darn good, put it that way. I've spent many hours listening to this while playing one of my favorite PS2 games Splashdown (the first one) so whenever I listen to this cd now my mind always pictures the game going with it. Wierd I know, but anyway, buy this album and create your own great memories with it. It's an incredible piece of artistic progressive metal!
B00006RJHG|5.0|When I got my hands on this DVD then saw it for the first time, it was unbelievable that the same guy who made that funny little ditty of a movie A CHRISTMAS STORY made this dark, menacing horror-thriller. It also has one of the best endings of a horror film in years, and was pre-Halloween. I do have to agree that Carpenter did take some of this movie as, at the very least, an inspiration. But these are two different directors doing to big films that have both become, in their own right, classics. <br /> <br />The story revolves around a group of sorority girls who are staying at a sorority house over Christmas break. None of them have any idea that there's something...somebody in the attic. All of the actors here are in fine form, with Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and John Saxon leading the way. I really liked the fact that Margot Kidder did not play an innocent girl like Lois Lane was in the later SUPERMAN movies. I think I relished her more in the drunk now, sleep later woman. It's clumsy but it's so believable and great. The best part of this movie is that you never see the killer, but you do see his shadow and an eye, but that's all you get...you will never find out who the killer is in the movie. It's actually better that way, it leaves you hungering for more. John Saxon never wastes and scenes here...he chews up his scenery with grace and poise. Good man! The one death in the movie that was so surreal was the glad wrap killing, where the girl was suffocated, then propped up in the attic in the chair where no one finds her, and the insane killer has his way. That one scene where he goes crazy up there has to be terrifying...no one would want to find a crazy, even a monster like this, up in their attic. And who can forget the ending, which leaves nothing discovered and everything left wide open (sadly, Bob Clark never made a sequel...it would have been interesting to see what happens next).  <br /> <br />As it stands alone, BLACK CHRISTMAS is a cult classic. It's scary, creepy, terrifying, and downright splendid. Never seeing the face of the killer or who it is ultimately adds to the unbearable suspense you will feel in certain places throughout the movie. A classic in its own right, you won't be feeling very good after seeing this 'CHRISTMAS'. By the way, is anyone going up to the attic?
0316168815|4.0|One of my friends suggested to read this book for our online book club, and I'm glad she referred the book.<br /><br />Overall, I give it 4 stars because it shows an interesting view of after death and deals with a variety of family issues.  However, I don't believe it's the greatest book in the world.<br /><br />For some reason, I couldn't read the book in a couple of sittings.  I had to step away after reading a couple of chapters.  Perhaps this was to think about what happened in the book so far.<br /><br />I recommend this book to every book club out there.
0316172324|2.0|The author spends an inordinate amount of time putting together anecdotes about situations in which people with extraordinary training in a given subject (for example, art) can determine when an item (e.g. a sculpture) is real or fake.  So what.  A well trained eye can determine a fake Rolex in the blink of an eye.  If they are trained in what to look for and are intimately familiar with the details, then it should come as no surprise.   <br /> <br />What is MISSING is any advice, hints or other information to help the average \\"Joe\\" learn to put those abilities to work in the real world. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time.

B000007MVL|4.0|I 1st fell in love with Kate Bush's music on her appearance on Saturday night live. She performed music from The Kick In Side.     Lionheart was the 1st album I purchased however. It is one of my favorites. Perhaps it is sentimental but I find it charming, funny and incredibly sensual. I have since purchased ever album of Kate Bush's. The Sensual World is my least favorite. I believe because it loses some of the innocence of the early albums and does not have the deep complicated and haunting frantic pace of hounds of love.   Every record is great and different, that is what makes her great. I believe you are never so so on Kate. You absolutely love her music or don't get it. She will always be my favorite, and Lionheart will always be my sentimental favorite.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|You will absoultely love this CD.  It's so refreshing and man can Michael sing.  I happen to be in a resturant where they were playing this CD and I had to ask the hostess who it was. She ran over and picked up the CD and showed it to me.  She told me that it's one of the best CD's she's ever bought and highly recommened it.  I bought the CD and I now do the same...I highly recommend this CD for not only it's refreshing sound, but for the beautiful way Michael sings the soft, romantic sultry songs such as \\"Home\\" and \\"You and I\\" (oh yeah) in an oh such suductive way, as well as the way he jazzes songs up the swing time music - makes me get up and dance!  I can listen to this CD over and over.  I most defintely will keep this CD in my \\"favorites\\" pile.  I can hardly wait for the next CD....or better yet for Michael to come to my town for a concert!  BRAVO!
B000002C25|5.0|For a long time it was impossible for people to take an objective view of Oasis.  They were either the greatest band in the world or a joke, depending on who you asked.  I think grunge had trained a lot of people into thinking it wasn't cool to like partying, acting stupid, and just rocking --- which is really what Oasis were about.  In this sense they were more like Guns n Roses than the Beatles.  And just like GNR their career basically imploded following their third, bloated album. <br /> <br />But in retrospect \\"Be Here Now\\" was everything Oasis was meant to be from the beginning--- totally over the top.  Like others here have mentioned, the reversal of critical opinion regarding \\"Be Here Now\\" was striking.  Having ignored the first two Oasis albums (which turned out to be seminal), the music press rushed to proclaim \\"Be Here Now\\" a great album upon release.  But the problem was that Oasis had fulfilled their destiny in becoming drugged out, over-produced, groupie shagging rock stars.  Like many bands that were huge in Britain, Americans just didn't seem to get it.  There was really no where left for Oasis to go.  Opinion of the album accordingly shifted. <br /> <br />Having watched Oasis flounder with \\"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants\\" and \\"Heathen Chemistry,\\" and regroup with this year's \\"Don't Believe the Truth,\\" it's easier to judge \\"Be Here Now\\" in context.  It's a sprawling, out of control record that has a life of its own.   <br /> <br />I don't think any band could purposefully set out to make a record this audacious. \\"Be Here Now\\" is a product of a band that was too high and wrapped up in their own fame to believe they had limits.  When you listen to it now it sounds overblown in the best way possible-- like T.Rex's \\"The Slider\\" or the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" records. <br /> <br />The sound is huge, arena rock.  The songs last too long.  The album as a whole lasts too long.  The cover art is ridiculous.  The lyrics are ridiculous.  It's almost a parody.But beneath it all, the songs are good.  It's loud.  It sounds great when you're drunk.  There are a couple of good ballads that might even cause the drunk girl next to you to drunkenly make-out with you.  In short, this is what rock n roll is supposed to be.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Apologies for the 1 star and 2 star ratings by those reviewers stuck in the 80's. Playing the Angel is DM's darkest and creative since Violater IMHO. From the industrial sounds on \\" The Pain that I'm used to\\" to the good guitar riff on \\" Suffer Well\\" and some of the slower soulful songs offered later on the CD providing a great Mix and many different hooks and stimulating directions.This is a great formula that really works on PTA. One thing that DM is not on this new release, is repetetive or stagnant. My compliments to DM for staying fresh and innovative in the New Millinium while visiting some of their older roots sounds of their earlier albums. ( I also am an old fan since 1981 and have fond memories of March 26th 1985 in U of H's 800 seat Cullen Auditrium and at the ripe old age of 23, jumping onstage during one of the encore songs and grabbing David Gahan's trouser's before I was thrown back by security.) Has it been that Long :) :)
B00097A5I6|5.0|If this was a debut album, everyone would be going crazy over this band.  Problem is that it's Oasis, and many people decided long ago that it's not cool to like them.  Oasis have been labelled as rip-off artists because they don't try to hide their influences.  For some reason, no one held this against the Rolling Stones and Led Zepplin (who ripped-off countless blues artists) and all of the modern garage band/ 60's revival crew, but Oasis are just too \\"unoriginal.\\"    I don't think I'm gonna win too many converts here, but if you have an open mind and just stop thinking about how uncool it is to like Oasis and listen, you will probably really like this album.  Yes, it has that classic rock sound.  It feels like you've heard this somewhere before.  The songs are very catchy.  The album is consistent.  It all fits together.  The musicians are great.  The singing is great (so long as you haven't already decided you find Liam's voice annoying).  If you like classic rock, I really don't see why you wouldn't like this album if you take it on its own terms.    Oasis fans will probably get this without question.  This album is one of their best.  Hard to compare it to any other-- it's still Oasis, but the sound is different, rootsier than before.  If you took each Oasis album out of context and listened to them, you might decide that this was the best of all.  It certainly won't have the impact of their first two, but musically, it's just as good.    To sum up: a really great album by a very underrated band.
0525948023|3.0|I've read all of Tolle's books, and I've always had a mixed response to him. <br /> <br />I appreciate what he says about living in the now. He presents this idea clearly and forcefully. <br /> <br />But I find his concept of the \\"pain body\\" to be reductionist and over-simplified.  The \\"pain body\\" is not so easy to deal with as Tolle would have us believe.  \\"Just be present,\\" is an all but useless prescription for someone truly in the grip of their \\"pain body\\". <br /> <br />I'm not sure what I feel about the more Buddhist concepts of \\"non-attachment\\" and being \\"ego-less\\".  Tolle often quotes Jesus in his works.  Was Jesus non-attached to life?  One could make a compelling argument that He was supremely attached to life. <br /> <br />As for the ego--things get a bit fuzzy. Are we to have an ego, or are we to dissolve the ego and become ego-free? And what does all that mean, anyway?  It seems to me that one of the great tricks of the ego is to convince us that we can be ego-free. <br /> <br />There is always a certain coldness about Tolle's writing.  This may be intentional, but it doesn't make the state of being in the now seem very appealing.  I've found that so many of the people attracted to Buddhist or Buddhist-like practices are intellectuals.  They are attracted by the concepts of Buddhism.  They are attracted by the concept of seeing themselves existing in the now.  When they practice, are they trying to be in the moment, or are they trying to be their concepts? <br /> <br />Tolle's writing is highly conceptual.  Some of it borders on gobbledy-gook, unfortunately.  He claims to be using language to point beyond language, but does he have to use such abstract language: form, being, etc...? <br /> <br />This book is essentially an expanded--and, unfortunately, padded--version of \\"The Power of Now\\".  That book is still the standard.  Perhaps Tolle really has nothing more to say.  The key now is to really practice.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love this installment. It is possibly my favorite. I am especially fond of Theoden. His dialogue is golden. Upon the death of his son, his grief is poignant. \\"Simbelmÿne. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see that last days of my house.\\"<br /><br />Gandalf consoles him. \\"Th&eacute;odred's death was not of your making.\\"<br /><br />Theoden continues to grieve. \\"No parent should have to bury their child.\\" Then he begins to sob bitterly.<br /><br />Later, Theoden has steeled himself for the coming onslaught and dons his armor. His words draw strongly from Tolkien. \\"Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountain, like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.\\"<br /><br />From text of The Two Towers it runs as follows:<br /><br />Where now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?<br />Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?<br />Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?<br />Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?<br />They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;<br />The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.<br />Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning,<br />Or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?<br /><br />It is as though he is quoting from the oral tradition of his people.<br /><br />In addition to all of this there are so many wonderful elements in these films.<br /><br />We have the race across Rohan by Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn to rescue Merry and Pippen. Aragon's tracking and recreation of the events that enable the hobbits to escape their captors is masterful in its execution.<br /><br />Gimli and Legolas are wonderful.<br /><br />Aragorn is one of the Kings of Old!<br /><br />Eowyn longs for death and valor and will pierce your heart!<br /><br />Gollum is exceptional.<br /><br />Can I forgive Peter Jackson for the liberties that he takes with the elves fighting at Helms Deep?<br /><br />Sure. It really is good cinema!<br /><br />Can I forgive Jackson's butchering of the character of Faramir? OK. The sequence with Boromir and Faramir together is wonderful. It explains quite a bit.<br /><br />I can even forgive him of greater Crimes Against Tolkien which I will address in a review of The Return of the King. The Two Towers is wonderful. I cannot recommend it enough!
B000066C6Z|4.0|I think this is the best movie from the Zucker Brothers, it's a shame it had no sequels, like Airplane or Hot shots! I love this movie, I consider it's the funniest of the Whole Comedy series made it for the Zucker Brothers.
B0000BYM3K|1.0|<br />Here's a game you can play with this album. You can have loads of entertainment with it. Pick any song from this album at random and have someone else guess the original idea for it. That's right, this could be renamed the Iron Maiden plays Iron Maiden album.  <br /> <br /> <br />Montsegur - Opening riff an obvious rip off of The Fallen Angel from only the previous album. Which is a bit too much to take since THAT song served as an instant flashback to the Powerslave era. Also the chorus is ridiculous beyond ridiculous and has Bruce sing the mouthful 'At the gates and the walls of Montsegur, blood on the stones of the citaDEEEELL!!!!!' a whole four times per chorus. It also has a guitar line and vocal melody(the 'as we kill them all' part) that sounds like a sea shanty.  <br /> <br />Dance of death - Another quiet opener with the Harris' bass intro and Nicko playing the cymbals, an idea employed by Iron Maiden since 1992's Afraid to shoot strangers, frequently enough to have a whole album of songs with similar intros. Nothing important happens during the verse until the quiet acoustic part which would have been enjoyable as part of another song, but then they lose their minds and play a \\"dance around the campfire\\" like music sounding like a bad version of something off a Loreena McKennit album. You will find yourself burying your head in your hands as you hear Janick penned lyrics such as \\"I danced and I pranced.\\" Horrible. Just horrible.  <br /> <br />Face in the sand - A cut above the other songs on the album, but listen to the chorus part. It reminds you of Transylvania from the first album.  <br /> <br />Wildest Dreams - Very average rocker and next to Wicker man or Futureal it sounds very tired and limp.  <br /> <br />Rainmaker - Good riff but very incomplete. This would normally be a section of a good Maiden song, so its like its cut in half.  <br /> <br />Age of innocence, Gates of Tomorrow, New Frontier are more un-note worthy fillers on an album of fillers.  <br /> <br />Journeyman - A pleasant acoustic song but one anyone anywhere will have heard somewhere else. I'm still trying to figure out where I've heard this tune before.  <br /> <br /> <br />Paschendale - The 'epic' which many obsessed fans rave about. It consists of a blindingly obvious riff with cheap also obvious orchestral background and the opening riff from Adrian is so contrived it makes you wince. They carry this on for about 9 minutes (I can't be bothered to check, this goes to you pedantic blind followers that look to discredit any unfavourable review.)  <br /> <br />Overall it's quite simply mediocre, unimaginative, awful, dull sounding music. The sound is also poor, it's like you're listening through ear pads. It's upto them what they want to do but I predict that once again they have set themselves up for a backlash that could affect sales of the next album like they did after the release of X factor. This might be a good album by another bands standards but for Maiden it's rank and it reeks. It makes the Blaze years look like the golden era. Dance of death gets a half star (damn the rating system) \\"but no more\\".  <br />
0812550706|5.0|The best book you'll ever read!  I would definitely recommend Ender's Game to anybody that can imagine the impossible.  Even if you've always thought science fiction was not your favorite, Ender's Game will change your opinion forever.  Orson Scott Card takes you away from your noraml chain of thought as he wraps you in all the battles, thoughts, and conversations of the kids at battle school.  Ender goes to battle school earlier than most everyone else.  He then meets Petra, Carn, and others.  Some of whom he befriends, although others become his enemies.  As he glides in his studies, he fights his way to the top in the battle standings.  Ender eventually gets command of his own army, hand chosen by a kid smaller and smarter than himself.  This kid is Bean, who becomes Ender's right hand man. <br />     Ender's army is the best, training on end, day after day, way up in a cold steel, space station.  Why do these kids go to battle school, at such young ages as 8 and 9?  The buggers are coming.  The buggers already attacked earth once and the human race almost didn't survive.  Bugers are insect-like aliens far more intelligent than the human race.  Just after the first invasion starships were sent out and another battle took place.  Well, the kids are training to fight the buggers in a 3rd invasion.  As Ender goes through battle school, fighting and winning every battle, fighting, being younger, yet still more brilliant, he bends the rules, things change. <br />     Ender's Game is my favorite book of all time.  Its parallel novel, Ender's Shadow, made it my favorite.  However, you should read Ender's Game before you read Ender's Shadow if you're considering reading either.  I wished for days to live that life for whatever reason.  Card writes adult science fiction, but I would recommend it to even teenagers, whom can understand beyond the average level of reading.  (It is a little hard to understand otherwise.)  Ender's Game, being a Nebula and Hugo winner, isan excellent novel, sci-fi fan or not.
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|How would it feel to be a prisoner and have the opportunity to \\"get even\\" with your superiors by challenging them in a game of football? This situation would cause a great feeling of exhilaration among many inmates, and it happens to form the main plot of \\"The Longest Yard\\", a movie remake of the 1974 original that starred Burt Reynolds in the main role.<br /><br />In this updated version of Longest Yard, Adam Sandler stars as Paul Crewe. He is a man with a troubled past and a guilty conscience. He was once a professional football player, but was banned from the sport for fixing the outcome of a game by shaving points. This guilt has never quite left him and now, many years after the shameful scar from his past originated, he finds himself in prison. He is coerced by Warden Hazel- the man in charge of the prison and a guy with political aspirations- to put together a team of football players using other prisoners, with the goal in mind of pitting them against the guards of the prison in a nationally televised game. Sandler resists, but he ultimately gives in.<br /><br />This sports film offers some suspenseful moments and some good action. It also finds Sandler's character in a tough situation once more, when he is blackmailed by Warden Hazel into once again fixing a football game- this time, the actual game between the guards and the prisoners. Sandler has to make a difficult decision between taking the easy way out (fixing the game and avoiding a longer prison sentence) and doing what is ethical: Refusing to fix another game, like he did in the past, regardless of the consequences.<br /><br />Sandler is ok in his role as Paul Crewe, but I find myself a little resistant to accept him playing a semi- serious part. I say \\"semi- serious\\" because this film has many funny moments and Sandler fits it nicely during the comedic segments. But the more serious parts of the film seem a little awkward for Sandler. However, in the case of \\"Longest Yard\\", you don't seem to mind because the supporting cast is very good, and it includes Burt Reynolds (just like in the original movie), James Cromwell, Chris Rock, etc., along with several professional athletes, like Brian Bosworth, \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin, and others.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sports film with a generally positive message and a satisfying outcome. It isn't quite as good as the 1974 original, but it does offer some solid entertainment, some good comedy, and some serious moments as well, to combine into a pleasant motion picture.because the supporting cast is very good, and it includes Burt Reynolds (just like in the original movie), James Cromwell, Chris Rock, etc., along with several professional athletes, like Brian Bosworth, \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin, and others.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sports film with a generally positive message and a satisfying outcome.

B00005ASGG|5.0|John Ford's 1962 classic, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, brings together western stars James Stewart and John Wayne for the first time, and the result is one of the great films of the western genre.<br /><br />James Stewart stars as Ransom Stoddard--U.S. senator--who returns to the small town of Shinbone to attend the funeral of his old friend Tom Doniphon. Stoddard is something of a celebrity in this town having gained his considerable reputation for being \\"the man who shot Liberty Valance,\\" a reputation which had propelled him first to the state house and eventually to Washington. When the local fish wrap gets wind of his appearance in town, they insist on interviewing the senator about his past and want to know why he would return all the way to Shinbone for this particular, seemingly insignificant funeral. Stoddard eventually takes them aside and begins to tell them the true story of Liberty Valance.<br /><br />Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), of course, was the most notorious thug in the territory in the days before statehood. He welcomed the newcomer Stoddard into town by robbing him and delivering a sound beating and a thrashing from his signature whip. Stoddard was a newly-minted lawyer at that time who had arrived into town from back East. If Ransom Stoddard represented Eastern values, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) represented the old West. Stoddard wants to deal with Valance through the law; Doniphon tells him, \\"Out here, a man settles his own problems,\\" and urges Stoddard to buy a gun. In between these two men is Hallie (Vera Miles), the woman Doniphon plans to marry some day, but who increasingly grows protective of and attentive to Ransom Stoddard.<br /><br />Ford clearly is extolling western values over eastern values in this film. Ultimately, Stoddard is portrayed as the far weaker man and Doniphon as his clear superior. Stoddard is humiliated in overt as well as in subtle ways throughout the film (you would never see Doniphon wearing an apron such as Ford has Stoddard wearing). Ironically, Stoddard's reputation is based upon a code of behavior that he himself never subscribed to. The values of the old west have faded in the new age, and Tom Doniphon's death symbolizes the passing of an era. Senator Stoddard, perhaps more than anyone, knows that Doniphon was the better man, though Stoddard was the one who reaped the rewards of celebrity, political power, and love while Doniphon faded away into obscurity.<br /><br />THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE was John Ford's nostalgic tribute to the genre that established his reputation, and it is one of his finest films. The lead performances are solid throughout--John Wayne's, perhaps, being his most archetypical (\\"Whoa, take 'er easy there, Pilgrim\\"). There is a lot of great dialogue in this movie and the supporting cast, including Edmond O'Brien, Andy Devine, and Ken Murray are wonderful. John Carradine even pops in briefly with a delightful performance as a pompous windbag of an orator. THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE is one of the essential movies of its genre.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

B00097A5HW|1.0|I bought the album because the initial reviews here are quite positive about it. They say that the album is nothing out of the ordinary, but acceptable. I completely disagree. The album is worst than the ordinary and not acceptable. <br /> <br />Except for la tortura, which sounds extremely commercial and resembles any of those \\"latin\\" songs (i.e. Ricky Martin & Co) though it is still a good song. The rest of the album is simply poor. It navigates through different styles without finding its own. In fact, it loses ground when compared to any of her previous \\"rocker\\" roots of previous albums. I even listened to \\"ladrones\\" afterwards to see if the problem was my change in musical taste, but it is not the case. That album is still great and clearly has a \\"Shakira\\" quality to it. Songs in this one are just bland, so not worth the money. I would put mine for sale if I could, but this is one of the drawbacks of digital files!

1400031362|4.0|I am reading the Number One Ladies Detective series in order, and this is clearly the worst of the three I have read so far.  However, that isn't a bad indictment on this charming and easy to read book.   <br /> <br />In this book, our hero's assistant, who was promoted to Assistant Detective in Tears of the Giraffe, finds herself in an expanded role in the detective business, and in the automotive repair business too.  For reasons not entirely explained, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni suffers from depression and takes a theraputic vacation, leaving his business in the hands of his fiancee and her trusted assistant.  I was disappointed that we didn't find out more about the cause of the depression, but perhaps that is the cliffhanger to lead the reader to the next book, The Kalahari Typing School for Men. <br /> <br />There are two main detective tales in this book, one involving each of our two lady detectives.  Each are solved with uncommon common sense from two of the smartest women in Africa.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|A couple years ago I interviewed Clive Cussler and asked him why it has taken so long for another one of his novels to be turned into a movie?  He told me that he was SO upset at how Hollywood butchered 'Raise the Titanic' (one of the greatest adventure novels EVER written, by the way) that he would NEVER again sell one of his novels...UNLESS he had script approval, actor approval and director approval.  Virtually every year someone came knocking on his door making another offer, and he said the same thing: \\"Sure...just give me what I want and you can pick and choose which book you want to put to film.\\"  They kept saying there was no way that would happen, so he politely declined each year, even though they kept offering more and more money each time.  FINALLY somebody made the appropriate concession and suddenly 'Sahara' was turned into a viable screenplay.  However Clive became unimpressed at the adaptation and against the deal they had made, decided to go ahead with the script they had WITHOUT author approval...hence the lawsuit we keep hearing about.<br /><br />While 'Sahara' is not the Cussler novel I would have picked to put on the big screen, it IS a fun book (as are all of the Dirk Pitt stories) and I looked forward to it nevertheless.  I MUST admit as many others have noticed, the deviation of the written plot, especially leaving out the historical Abraham Lincoln storyline left me almost disgusted -- at first.  Cussler told me that of ALL the hundreds of fictional characters he has created over the years, only Al Giordino was based on a REAL person.  For personal reasons, he was VERY determined to make sure that Giordino was cast correctly...but unfortunately finding a short, muscle-bound, curly black haired Italian was easier said than done.  After months of searching, it became obvious that finding the RIGHT person to play the role as written in the Pitt novels just wasn't going to happen.  This certainly helped me to accept that blunder much better -- even though I REALLY enjoyed Steve Zahn's performance as Al.  It was well done and offered the biggest laughs of the entire movie bar-none.<br /><br />After seeing it on the big screen and again on DVD, I did my best to watch it without any expectations as a Cussler fan, and you know what?  It was pretty dang fun anyways.  Sure, a lot of details were dropped (quite a LOT actually) from the novel, but one thing I was VERY impressed at was how family-friendly the movie was as a whole.  Sure there was action and violence, but the sex and language was pretty much nil -- which goes against virtually ALL the Hollywood norms these days.<br /><br />In short: for the Dirk Pitt fans who are also the purists and expect no change from the written novels, you may want to pass on 'Sahara'.  For those who are looking for a fun, adventure-laced movie loosely based on a Cussler book, you are in for a fun time.  I think I fall somewhere in between.  I enjoyed the movie, but I am also disappointed that the storyline wasn't followed closer.  All in all I will eagerly await a follow-up Dirk Pitt movie (if Cussler even allows it...which is questionable at best at this point...) and I felt that the casting of Matthew as Dirk Pitt was right on.  I have wondered for YEARS who in Hollywood would do the character justice and I must admit, he did a great job.  I hope he gets another opportunity to do it again.  My choice for next book to be turned into movie: Atlantis Found or Dragon.  Just a thought.even though I REALLY enjoyed Steve Zahn's performance as Al.

B000B2YQX4|3.0|I don't wish to be all pretentious, but I have been listening to this band since I was 11 -- that was 1981, the year that Speak and Spell appeared. I have witnessed firsthand the evolution from electro-pop to pseudo-industrial to psuedo-rock, etc. Without question, the band hit their creative peak with Black Celebration -- simply the greatest synth album of all-time. They of course hit their commercial peak with Violator. I can't argue with the quality of that album, although I feel that it doesn't ultimately satisfy like Black Celebration. That's just my opinion. Since Alan Wilder left, the band has never quite sounded like Depeche Mode. I am continually perplexed by the sea of Ultra lovers out there. That album sounds like VH-1 Tears for Fears. If that's your thing, that's cool, but Ultra is light-years away from the true Depeche Mode. Exciter was anything but -- it somehow managed to depress me even more than Ultra -- a monumental feat. Now here comes Playing the Angel. After hearing the fairly inspiring \\"Precious\\" on the radio, I decided to give my once-favorite band a final chance. And they only mildly disappointed me. This album blows Ultra and Exciter out of the water.....and maybe even SOFAD, but it comes nowhere near the heights of classic Mode. Certainly, the loss of Alan Wilder is a huge factor, but ultimately, the blame falls on Martin Gore. His religious fascination has clouded every release from SOFAD on... enough already with the biblical references. We get the idea. Gary Numan is currently experiencing the same problem. It's as if middle age has stymied their world-view. If Martin writes one more song about being a sinner I am going to cry. Not to mention that there are so few hooks these days. Black Celebration was super-dark, but more importantly, it was also super-catchy. Most every song on that album is memorable.... I can't remember a single song from Exciter....It's no good is the only song I recall from Ultra -- oh, maybe Useless -- that was ok. Post-Alan Wilder Playing the Angel is without question the best album. But it pales in comparison with classic mode circa 1985-86. For the love of god, let's be honest.
B000069HJM|4.0|I have always been amazed at the hoopla surrounding the origins of this band. Money can't buy talent and while their benefactor may have greased the skids, the preceding three decades have borne witness to that man's ear for talent. Rick Davies and his cohorts have produced many great songs over the years - songs that stand the test of time - unlike many of their contemporaries I might add. And let's face it, few albums consist of one great song after another. Of course, this is all subjective and the masses generally vote with their wallets but I suggest that you revisit these fine songsmiths.  <br /> <br />This album is one of my favorites, having as it does, a strong Latin flavor. From the opening Tito Puente like percussion of \\"It's Alright\\" through \\"I'm Beggin' You\\" to \\"An Awful Thing To Waste\\", this album swings. I don't say \\"rocks\\" as this band was never your typical rock band. Each album was a concept and a little different from what went before.  <br /> <br />I will admit that their ballads never quite cut it for me but unlike another great band, Chicago, they didn't lose sight of the music. <br /> <br />No discussion of Supertramp is complete without mentioning Roger Hodgson. For Supertramp fans this was comparable to parental divorce - many of whom suffer its effects still! In my opinion, the seperation was inevitable and the product of the rift has been even more great music. From his debut \\"In The Eye of The Storm\\" through three albums,  Hodgson has crafted some great music.  <br /> <br />So for those of you late to the show, do by all means pick up a Greatest set. And if you like rhythm and roll, buy this album.

B000055XMF|5.0|I only came by this film after seeing it constantly referenced in the book 'You Are Here' by Steve Horsfall. It has to be one of the best films I have ever seen - it's gritty, fast moving and superbly acted.

Acid, alcohol, and eventually heroin: it all did him in. This is perhaps the most important point made in Oliver Stone's biography of the still-popular title band famed for its lyricist's creativity and unique sound. Early on in the film we see that all of the members are taking acid, experimenting with drugs, etc. but it was Morrison who continued. His bandmates took acid to expand the mind while he maintained the practice till his progressive demise; Stone supposes he took himself and his acid too seriously, and though little exploration into the depths of Morrison's psyche take place otherwise, at least this notion is analyzed persuasively and even movingly. <br /> <br />What's initially noticed is Stone's impeccable recreation of the era: the drugs, the sex, the psychedellic sense of style. Stone has always been amazing with visuals but here he really achieves a triumphant grasp of aesthetic milieu. Lighting, color: it contributes to the idea that most of the era was a bizarre mix of acid and something or other. People were twisted, and willingly so. The colors really are mesmerizing, from the Oscar-worthy sets and costumes to Robert Richardson's as-usual excellent DP work. The general motif is an orange-red, a color that suggests The Doors' curiously dark sound again enhancing everything we hear and everything we see. <br /> <br />So, it can be said that on a technical level The Doors is an achievement, yet it feels entirely lacking in the area of actual profundity. We never get a true sense of who Jim Morrison is, or who the rest of The Doors are. If anything the film should have been called Morrison or something just as obvious (which is a given in the biopic genre), because really the film is him. Maybe that's the point, since most of what Stone chooses to portray are Morrison's self-indulgences, which actor Val Kilmer performs perfectly (despite his overall superficiality). The rest of the actors do fine with toss-away roles as people in Morrison's life that are simply there to remind us of the real world outside of his halucinogenic brain. It's really a pity because their story is interesting, yet all the information is spread too thin considering the exploration only concerns Morrison and none of the other colorful characters. <br /> <br />When the film does stretch at least the imagery is enough to sustain interest. There is a brilliant acid trip sequence in a desert which serves to remind us of the artistry that was (and still is, in some cases) derived from such practices. Native American imagery is intertwined with a riotous concert to emphasize Morrison's shamanism. It is all so compelling, but it can feel a bit wasted. Luckily the images are as memorable in themselves as you would imagine, also featuring the striking image of a dead Jim Morrison engulfed in water, the same orange-red filling the bathroom. Some of the shamanism imagery also provides one of the few forays into Morrison's psyche. Stone effectively portrays his feeling of unification with the shaman lifestyle.  <br /> <br />In terms of the biopic genre The Doors is...okay, and possibly something I'd watch again. Besides towering triumphs like Raging Bull I haven't come across anything entirely of worth (*cough..Ray...cough*). The Doors, though visually exciting and sometimes involving, is ultimately thin, which is a pity. I love The Doors and Jim Morrison was an interesting man, but Stone just doesn't do their story as much justice as it deserves. Still, given that I've grown to love The Doors I can imagine watching this at late night hang-outs with my best friend Adrienne (she's obsessed). You know? I'd say this is a film for true Doors fans. If you love The Doors you'llwatch this film over and over, despite any flaws. If anything Stone manages to portray their mystique and creative aspirations most satisfactorily.

Possibly the first time he saw the shark he was nervous but that was it. We go around quoting Dory and her optimistic outlook. Its visually beautiful, its also about a parent learning to let his kid grow up.Its a movie we can enjoy together. He doesn't sit still for much tv but this one holds his attention. Its also a nice way to learn about the coral reef. We've been to aquariums and he'll yell out its Nemo, its Dory, its Gill. Definitely recommend this movie.

B00006LSM3|5.0|There are very few instrumentals in the Beatles' ouevre (as solo artists or as a collective). \\"Marwa Blues\\" is quite possibly the loveliest of them all. It's a soft, lilting slide guitar melody floating over a cloud of soft percussion and strings. It's gentle and warm, and appearing midway through this album, it makes for a perfect center of gravity.<br /><br />The other 11 songs on this album showcase the different facets of Harrison's personality quite nicely. Sardonic wit, gentle wisdom and boundless love are all couched in some of the best Harrison songs ever. His ukulele-driven cover of \\"The Devil and The Deep Sea\\" is a real charmer. This album is easily as good as any of Harrison's best work within or without the Beatles.<br /><br />This album is like a wonderful farewell gift, a souvenir from a life's journey of love and discovery.
B000003TAR|4.0|What an impossible task Nirvana must have faced when making this CD. They had to follow up Nevermind, one of the most pathbreaking and successful records of all time. They had to make something new, but still retain enough of the old so as not to alienate their fans. How could you even begin writing songs for this album? <br /> <br />The only thing more incredible than the challenge Nirvana faced was their success. The band somehow plowed full speed ahead without looking over their shoulder. In the true spirit of the grunge music they helped to define, they set their own standards. The result was a fantastic album. Musically, lyrically, stylistically, In Utero was the complete package. <br /> <br />The CD kicks off with Serve the Servants. This, in my opinion is everything that Nirvana was and stood for. Its hard edged but mellow, sarcastic but carefree, insulting yet comforting. In true Kurt Kobain fashion, the lyrics insult himself and thus his fans in a playful but depressing fashion. He begins \\"Teenage angst has paid off well/ Now I'm bored and old.\\" The line summarizes Kobain's hatred of his fame that plagued him until his death. The very notion of catering to his fans...of serving the servants...sickens him. With this song he sets the tone for the rest of the album: he will give the people what they want, but only on his own terms.  <br /> <br />The second song Scentless Apprentice shocks any listener who is looking for a mellow album. The song is quite possibly the rawest one ever made. Even the live version that appears on Muddy Banks feels more flat...less live. You can almost feel Cobain seeping through on this song. Simply incredible, although a bit simplistic. <br /> <br />Everyone's heard Heart Shaped Box. I never really liked this song, but I can see the appeal. Cobain again provides some soupy lyrics along with climatic choruses. <br /> <br />Rape Me is, of course, impossible to ignore. The quintessential make your parents angry song. Aside from the shock effect, this is a very complete and catchy song. <br /> <br />Frances Farmer is one of the strongest songs of the album. It really shows how Nirvana grew with this album in terms of their song structure. Rather than rely on a poppy and repetitive structure of a radio single, this song is grating in a way unique to Nirvana. The line \\"I will miss comfort in being sad\\" is one of Cobain's best written and delivered lines (although it may take you a long time to realize what the hell he is saying, as usual). It is a at once ironic, comic, sarcastic, uplifting, and depressing. It, like Cobain, is contradictory. <br /> <br />A lot of people like Dumb. I don't. I think it's a lousy song full of stupid lines. <br /> <br />Very Ape and Milk It blend together as aggressive filler. Neither song is great, but they're not bad either. In many ways, these songs sound more like Nirvana's older stuff, which isn't a bad thing. <br /> <br />Pennyroyal Tea is my favorite track on the record. The lyrics are actually a bit poor, but the groove is infectious. It really stands out amongst some average tracks in the middle of the album. <br /> <br />Radio Friendly and Tourrette's are two crazy, fast paced songs. The lyrics of Radio Friendly hopefully are sarcastic, otherwise they're just stupid. Tourrette's is barely understandable, but the lyrics don't really matter. The point is to jump up and down and punch your friend in the face. In that respect, these songs succeed. Even better versions of these songs appear on Muddy Banks. <br /> <br />All Apologies is perhaps my favorite song lyrically from Cobain. Unfortunantly it's a bit mellow and repetitive for my taste. Here, Cobain questions who he is and implicitly who the listener is. He exposes our own voyeurism to his intimate songwriting. In all, a perfect end to an album. <br /> <br />Sure, this CD doesn't have the hits of Nevermind. But it is a more mature, more complicated, and more interesting album. This record makes Nevermind seem silly and repetitive. I would highly reccommend it to anyone who likes any of Nirvana's styles: the mellow, the aggressive, or anything in between.
B000002G7E|5.0|I consider this to be an amazing album from the best band ever to excist.  Sister Ray is an amazing peice.  The title track, Here She Comes Now and Lady Godiva's Operation are my favorite songs on it.  I also love the Gift.  It's just great.  Amazing really.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|For those of you unfamiliar with Fiona Apple, her music is dark, dreary, occasionally uplifting, and always emotional. The songs have a structure more associated with pop music (maybe Alicia Keyes or Natalie Imbruglia) , but her deep voice shows that there is something more profound and disturbing under this facade. In her previous album, Tidal, with a few exceptions, Apple would sing the poetic verses that she wrote earlier in her life with piano accompaniment. This got a little tedious after a while. This follow up album corrects many of the problems of the first CD. In Tidal, it appeared as if she was holding back. There was definantly emotion and anger, but this rarely came through. In When the Pawn...we get Apple in all her anger. Tidal also suffered from a repetitious song structure and limited musical experimentation. With her second effort, Fiona experiments with long jazzy interludes and a variety of accompanying sounds to add texture to her music. The overall result is one of the most complete, powerful, and inspiring CDs ever released. With this album, Fiona really reached her potential.  <br /> <br />When the Pawn...opens with On the Bound, which sets the tone for the rest of the album. It is a dark sound with background sounds that really give the song a driving and grating feel. Here she proclaims \\"Hell don't know my fury\\" and by the end of the album the listener will have a better understanding of this fury. Yet, the track also shows her vulnerabiltiy that will also become a theme of When the Pawn... She sings \\"I dont know what I'm doing,/ dont know should I change my mind, I cant decide,/ there's too many Variations to consider.\\" She continually undermines herself throughout the CD and shows her weaknesses. She puts her heart, her mind, and her soul with others, as she repeats \\"You're all I need.\\" Yet, there is a questioning of this total devotion as she ends the song with \\"Tell me you belong to me/ Baby that it's all gonna be alright/ I believe thatit isn't.\\" Fiona finds independence and power in her pessimism. This is the only way for her to overcome her wishful desires, which she sees as weaknesses. <br /> <br />To Your Love finishes up where Fiona left off. In this song she is further questioning her own feelings. She begins \\"Here's another speech you wished I'd swallow.\\" Here again, she is using pessimism and sarcasm to give her self indepedence and power from her emotions. But then we hear self-doubt of even her pessimism. Her chorus \\"The pain is evident in my existence/ <br />Please forgive me for my distance/ The shame is manifest in my resistance\\" laments that she cannot get close to somebody because of her negative outlook towards emotions. She confesses \\"But by the time I'm close to you, I lose\\" and \\"I just need to be reassured\\". The tables have turned since To your Love. Instead of a source of power, her doubts prevent her from happiness, from true friendship, and from true love. Quite a beginning to an album. <br /> <br />Then we get Limp. In my opinion Fiona's best song and the reason I initially bought the CD. Lyrically, the song is incredible. Musically it is a wild ride. I was always a little confused as to what exactly this track was about, but now I have my own theory, although I could be wrong. To me, this song is focusing Fiona's apprehensions towards men/ sex and showing how her being raped at an early age has distorted her images of men in general. Arguments and frustrations that she has had in other relationships take on the imagery of a rape. She writes \\"You'll beat me with your bitter lies/So call me crazy, hold me down/Make me cry; got off now, baby-\\" thus interspersing relationship troubles with the trauma of molestation. She compares her frustration towards men to her anger towards her violation \\"And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists/I never did anything to you, man.\\" And finally, she uses the image of \\"Lying limp in your own hand\\", a blatantly sexual reference, to compare the rape to the breakup of the relationship. Like the rapist who became 'limp' at the end of the act, the target of her lyrics also will eventually lose his power over her as the relationship disolves. Thus, male limpness becomes a source of empowerment, where the sexual drive is no longer a factor in binding her to the male.  <br />Even if you don't accept this interpretation, you have to admit the song is complex and pure poetry. I should also mention that the best part of the song is the power of its delivery and the jazzy interlude that takes over midway through. <br /> <br />Love Ridden is a more mellow song that discusses an aftermath of a breakup. <br /> <br />Paper Bag is one of my favorite songs musically. Lyrically it reminds me of a scene from American Beauty.  <br /> <br />With Mistake we get a return to the theme of equating weakness with her inability to get close to others. This time, she calls this pessimism a mistake. <br /> <br />Fast As You Can is another great song musically. Its fast paced delivery really draws you into the song. Apple returns to the theme of getting power from being withdrawn (in defiance of her previous song). Her procomation that she is \\"blooming within\\" says it all. Her 'craziness', her distance is what makes her what she is. She can deny that this is an important part of her self-identity. <br /> <br />Way Things Are is a more uplifting song. Instead of lamenting the mistakes or blaming men for her own pain, Fiona here is resolved to the \\"way things are.\\" She realizes that she is perhaps \\"much better off\\" and that she is \\"able to move on.\\" <br /> <br />Get Gone is another great sounding track. Here she shows her desire to withdraw and separate from others. Much like Limp she equates sexual conquering with the end of the relationship (how literal this is supposed to be is unclear) as she sings \\"You got your game, made your shot, and you got away/ With a lot, but I'm not turned-on.\\" Sex for Apple here is neccessarily an act of powerlessness, as in a rape. She says quite simply \\"I'm not benefitting.\\" Wheather or not she derives pleasure from it is immaterial, the fact is that, for Apple, sex is a way for men to force a kind of closeness that makes her weak and vulnerable. <br /> <br />I Know casually closes out the album. It is a bit mellower than other tracks.  <br /> <br />I've concetrated on Fiona's lyrics only because they are amazing. Musically this album is wonderful and I apologize if I haven't got this point across. I consider this to be one of the best CDs ever. I would recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AADYRQ|5.0|If I could use one word to describe how I feel when I listen to this album, it would be gratified.  I can listen to the album from beginning to end and feel the same amount of content as I did the time before.  If you like and appreciate musical talent, you shouldn't have any problem loving this album as much as I do.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|This ain't a 5-star release nor a \\"Violator\\", but anything less than 3-stars are probably from non-DM fans trying to get a rise out of real DM fans.  The first half of the cd mostly contain the more 'upbeat'(as in mid-tempo for DM) songs that all sound really good and are immediately accessible, esp 1,2,3,4,&5.  The second half mostly contain the slower songs which are less accessible and requires more listenings to in order to let them sink in and judge them on their own merits; and these are the songs that will probably make or break this release as either 'just another good effort' or 'slightly underrated classic'.  All of us can agree to what an up-tempo song has to offer, but all of us will have a different take on a slower song that requires us to take in the lyrics and music more at our own pace.<br /><br />People putting this cd down off the bat after one or two listens should not be taken seriously.  This is a good release as it stands now, with a potential to be even better later down the road.  But even if I don't find another personal favorite 'ballad' along the lines of \\"Somebody\\", \\"Home\\" or \\"Waiting for the Night\\" in the second half of this cd in the near future(i actually had trouble with those 3 on first listenings, now all three are personal faves esp \\"Home\\"); I still stand by the 4-star rating.  For me, the first half is good enough to compensate for the second half.  If only there had been a few upbeat 'bonus' remixes at the end to offset the slower second half this might've even been a 5-star release(but i guess that's what cd maxi-singles are for).  Btw, is anyone else freaked out by the cd cover?  Reminds me of the zulu/zuni(?) fetish doll from that \\"Trilogy of Terror\\"  horror movie back in the 80's.  Spooky.
B00008YLV2|5.0|This was an absolute great movie when I saw it in 2002.  Everything about this movie was great.  The entire movie was as realistic \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  The cinematography was gritty and phenominal, placing you in the middle of Mogidishu.  The sound was in your face.  Ridley Scott did a terrific job of taking on this project, and the fact that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Director was upsetting.       The Deluxe Edition of the DVD is something to be desired.  The Commentary by the Director, Producer, and the REAL soldiers who were there are all insightful.  The History Channel Documentary on the Third Disc is something that needs to be watched before or after the viewing of the movie.    This is a great collection, in an even better DVD collection.  If you think about buying this movie, buy the Deluxe Edition, and you won't be dissapointed.
B00009Z576|3.0|Originally released in 1980, as many long time Yes fans may consider this effort to be like an insult to their intelligence. However, 'Drama' really isn't all that bad. It's so-so. I mean when you replace keyboardist Rick Wakeman with Geoffrey Downes and frontman / vocalist Jon Anderson with Trevor Horn, you're (more) than likely to draw some negative responses there. Personally, I would consider 'Drama' to be second class art rock. I initially was going to give this CD reissue a two-star rating - but after listening to it's ten added bonus tracks (you read that right), I believe I will now raise that to a three star rating. Even though most of these extra tunes are cutting floor material - several of these tracks are actually sort of good. As for the regular lp, cuts that I wound up being a bit partial to are \\"Machine Messiah\\" (definitely tends to stand out some), \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" and the \\"Uptempo Fugit\\". Just remember: that when you put this CD into your home entertainment center, 'Drama' simply isn't the (same) Yes and we all have come to know and love for over forty years now.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Rod's rock and roll career proved that he was brilliant at interpreting other people's work.  Bob Dylan, Sam Cooke, Etta James and Tim Hardin provided Rod an opportunity to soulfully perform covers that with Rod's gravelly vocals, were wonderful.  His latest money making scheme provides soulless versions of the originals.  Let's hope that Rod doesn't change his mind and that this is truly the last of his American Songbook debacle.  You're not really too old to rock are you Rod?
0740748475|5.0|A hearty good read. It really didn't make me laugh as much as I remember, but my sentimentality for the characters and the beauty of the art make this a must-have. The only current strip I would even deem close to the quality of C&H is Pooch Cafe. I heartily recommend that strip to anyone who enjoys laughter.
B0002OERI0|1.0|when b##ches like Billie Joe Armstrong get cover on Guitar Legends? All he does is b#$ch about how much he hates America and how would like to move to France. Why don't you do us all a favor and move! It is a shame when a crappy guitarist who is an even crappier lyricist and vocalist gets the Guitar Legend issue after friggn Randy Rhoads! How can you even compare the two! I find it hard to compare Dimebag Darrell with Randy Rhoads, and that guy could actually play pretty dern good and he died too, making him a legend as does everyone who does! It seems that Green Day has run out of true lyrics, so all they have now is to b#$ch about how much they hate life and America and how they want to live in F#$king France! WHy don't they just give Osama a huge #$%#job while they are at it! I am okay with liberal statements in songs but not when they make the rest of the album crappy! Want an example of how you make a good liberal statement without pissing the friggn crap out of everyone (like yours truly)? Do what the Rolling Stones did in \\"Sweet Neo Con\\", make it sound good and inspiring and suggestive even if it sounds too 2003 to make sense and even if you happen to be 65 years old or so! I am not conservative, I am an independent, but such extreme messages that make your music crappy I can't stand. Billie Joe Armstrong isn't even that good of a guitar player, he can play punk, but how hard is that? I could play punk! Want to put someone on guitar legend how actually have talent? Oh, there are alot: Brian May of Queen(whoa, he is actually on there now), Eddie Van Halen, Jimie Paige, Jimi Hendrix, Zakk Wylde (unless you consider the Randy Rhoads one as Ozzy Osbourne guitarists), Steve Vai, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Metallica, Iommi, Motley Crue, Guns n' Roses, maybe even friggn Poison if it gets that bad but not some b@#cher like Green Day! Want a friggn punk band to grace the cover? Get the Clash, Ramones or Sex Pistols! Its not that friggn hard!
B00011RPB0|5.0|the best part of the movie was that there were almost no people in the theater. we walked up to the ticket window behind a girl's-night-out group who had some discount coupons and they gave us one so we got in for half price. yesssss!    \\"lost in translation\\" stars the inimitable bill murray and some girl i didn't know - scarlett johansson. there are plenty of good reviews on the internet... do a google to find something better than what i might write... or go here to see the hype, trailers and reviews:    [...]    \\"lost in translation\\" was not the usual fare (thank dog)    although the actors were perfect and fabulous, the title was the star of the movie. if you go to see it, pretend that you don't understand english, japanese or german. that way, the words won't get in the way. just watch the characters and read their feelings... of course, half of those feelings will be, \\"i don't think i understand what this person is saying\\"... but the other half of the feelings, if you tap into your own wellspring of experience, will be perfectly clear, clean water that cleanses all the dirt and guilt off your smelly feeties and your imperfect, filthy, little heart. <g>    i won't give away the middle of the movie. it almost drags too much, but it drags good for all the right reasons... just like real life.    in the end, the \\"unwords\\" say so much more than the words. bill murray whispers something into his week-long friend's ear...    his mouth is hidden by her hair and it's impossible to hear what he says. the viewer is FORCED to interpret what is said by reading the characters' eyes and their body language...    if you can interpret what they communicate through other means than the spoken word, you will know the \\"secret of life\\"... if you can't, you may consider your life \\"lost in translation.\\" <g>    GOOD MOVIE!
0066620996|4.0|We need to encourage books like these. <br /> <br />Collins' teams research exhaustively, look deep, and help readers understand what makes a difference in business, day by day and year after year. <br /> <br />His work has inspired thousands of companies to define their purposes and visions; that's a good result, especially as I see peopple realize the value of getting clarity on who they are and why they come to work each day. <br /> <br />I wish Mr. Collins would resist the tendency to find metaphors to encapsulate ideas.  The Hedgehog Concept seems more annoying than helpful, as does Rinsing the Cottage Cheese.  In doing this, he seems to be pandering to popular preference.

B000B2YQX4|4.0|the thing that upsets me the most about this album is that, for months, before it was even released, the press compared this album to violator and said it was their best album. blah, blah blah. so of course people, me included, bought this cd hoping for just that. another violator. well, it's not. it is, however, better than exciter or even ultra. <br /> <br />it is a very good album. i wont compare it to another dm release. its good on its own. however, it does have it's flaws. first off, some of the songs seem unfinished. I really dont see what the hype is all about for the song, \\"john the revelator\\". i hate this song. it sounds like an finished bad demo for personal jesus or i feel you. its my least fave song on the album. and definetly my least fave depeche song.seriously. <br /> <br />\\"precious\\" is the best track on here. very beautiful song. their best single since \\"it's no good\\". and maybe since, \\"enjoy the silence. for me, there are some more stand out tracks here. the fast paced \\"lillian\\" (excellent!), \\"suffer well\\", which reminds me of behind the wheel--at least the music.  i love the dark songs, like, \\"nothings impossible\\". i used to prefer martin singing the ballads. but dave does a great job here. <br /> <br />something i looked forward to on each album was the songs martin sang. i've been waiting for another \\"a question of lus\\" for years. thats not happening here. \\"macro\\" is a martin sung ballad which falls short. the verses are terrible, but the chorus is not too bad. the other matin song is \\"damaged people\\". that one is pretty good. but no where near his best. <br /> <br />also, martin's songwriting has changed. his lyrics are not as deep anymore. they havnt been for years. and i have to give dave props for the songs he contributed lyrically to this album. <br /> <br />all in all, its a very good dm album. not 5 stars, but very good. even though my review started off negative.  <br /> <br />the reality for me though is, alan wilder is sorely missed.you can see it on this release and every release since sofad.
B000002KN8|4.0|of course 'speak and spell' sounds cheesy in 2005.  it's 25 years old and any fair assestment/critique of 'speak and spell' needs to examine when it was recorded and released.  in 1981 synthesizer music technology was still very much in its embryonic state. Very few bands (kraftwerk, human league, OMD, depeche mode, among other) used synths and even fewer knew how to harness the technology. i imagine programming synths was a lot like building rocket ships -- lots of trial and error, some hits, some misses.<br /><br />it should come as little suprise, then, that 'speak and spell' is a bit simplistic and cheesy.  what's impressive about 'speak and spell,' however, are the absolutely phenomenal melodies vince clark composed. one listen to 'just can't get enough' and its permanently engravaed into your brain.  and since it was vince clarke's album, it bears hardly and resemblence to the latter martin gore dm albums (the exception being 'photographic' and 'puppets' -- both a bit darken in tone).  its easy to forgive vince for 'what's your name?' when he wrote such classic dm songs as 'new life,' 'dreaming of me,' and the aforementioned 'photographic' and 'just can't get enough.'<br /><br />what's special about 'speak and spell' are the classic dm synth intros--most of the songs have a synth intro. 'just can't get enough' and 'new life' are prime examples of a new style of songwriting.  vince didn't waste time with the hook coming in the middle of the song or the verse or a bridge. the hooks were front and center, immediate attention grabbers.  in that way, vince single-handedly changed pop songwriting.<br /><br />if you do invest in 'speak and spell,' be sure to get the import version.  several essential dm cuts aren't found on the US release, namely: 'i sometimes wish i was dead,' 'shout,' and 'ice machine.' of the three, 'shout' is a standout.  i sure wannabe synthlords scratched their collective heads wondering how in the world vince got that sort of sound out of a keyboard. it's an amazing song and worth the heavy asking price.<br /><br />in the end, does 'speak and spell' hold up 25 years on? no, not really. but that's hardly the point. to listen to an album released in 1981, you sort of have to listen to it with 1981 ears.  to do anything else does you, the album and the band a huge disservice because underneath the fluff lay some of the greatest synth songs ever penned by synth music's uberoverlord, vince clarke.song and worth the heavy asking price.     in the end, does 'speak and spell' hold up 25 years on? no, not really. but that's hardly the point. to listen to an album released in 1981, you sort of have to listen to it with 1981 ears.  to do anything else does you, the album and the band a huge disservice because underneath the fluff lay some of the greatest synth songs ever penned by synth music's uberoverlord, vince clarke.
B000002LCI|5.0|although black celebration and some great reward are my favorite depeche mode albums, music for the masses is the most special dm album for me. when i heard \\"strangelove\\" for the first time, i got goosebumps. that song meant something to me and to this day has a special meaning to me. it was a turning point in my life. so i related to it.  that's the thing about a good album. people can relate to it. and thats what i did with this album. <br /> <br />to this day, my fave martin sung ballads are \\" aquestion of lust\\", and \\"the things you said\\", which is included here. depeche mode's anthem, \\"never let me down again\\" is a highlight on this album. as is the underated \\"sacred\\". <br /> <br />i will love dm wether they are commercially successful or not. this is the album that took them from cult favorites in america to a commercial success. and the rest is history....
B00082IJ08|1.0|Before I bought this CD I was afraid that it was going to suck.  I really wanted to listen to the song \\"Feel Good Inc.\\", and I didn't want to steal it off the internet so I bought the CD. Boy did I make a mistake.  This CD is terrible. Basically all the songs consist of a few words, and they are somewhat annoying. The only thing that saves a few of the songs are the sweet beats. <br /> <br />If you don't want to steal the song just download Feel Good Inc. with Itunes.
B000093NLH|5.0|This album and video package was a pleasant surprise! The Scorpions are one the best Rock bands to ever play and record music. If you have been lucky enough to have seen them perform in a \\"live\\" setting then you are very fortunate! Here, the Scorpions render an amazing performance, while showing off a different acoustical variation of many of their very best songs. The performances are amazing, as is the sound quality. I feel that this is one of the best recordings of a musical performance ever made. Today, the Scorpions are still performing on a much more limited basis. The band members are indeed getting \\"up there\\" in years, and this is evident on the video of the \\"Acoustica\\" performances. But these guys are living legends, who always perform at a very high calibur. If you really like or love the Scorpions, then you will certainly enjoy this album. I say \\"Buy It!!!\\".
0060170123|4.0|...which is why it doesnt get 5 stars. After ploughing through 1472 pages (Phoenix Fiction), I initially felt cheated by the end. In fairness though, Seth's ending is probably a more accurate reflection of India in 1952. Otherwise, I loved this book.  <br />I was surprised by the reviewers who \\"didnt like all the politics\\". To me, Seth's ability to interweave fictional, personal stories with known historical events is what made it a masterpiece. OK, if you dont want to learn a great deal about India (politics, history, religion) just after independence, this book possibly isn't for you. But if you want to be transported into a world you'll never forget, buy this book!

B00005JNQA|4.0|\\"The Interpreter\\" has the distinction of being the first commercial movie to be filmed inside the United Nations building in New York City. The UN Charter prohibits commercial use of the building, but director Sydney Pollack was able to get permission to film from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on the grounds that the film's themes support the UN mission. It helps that \\"The Interpreter\\" was able to film on location inside the UN, as that building's huge open spaces and natural light improve the film's aesthetics considerably and would have been impossible to recreate. The premise is that Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), a simultaneous interpreter at the UN, overhears a conversation about an attempt on the life of Edmond Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), President of the fictional African nation of Matobo, who is scheduled to give a speech before the General Assembly. Secret Service Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) of the Dignitary Protection Squad, and his partner Agent Woods (Catherine Keener), are assigned to protect Zuwanie and to investigate Silvia's claim. Even when it becomes clear that her life is threatened, Silvia's politics concerning Zuwanie and her involvement in the drama are still suspect.<br /><br />Silvia Broome and Tobin Keller are not what I'd call well-written characters, but Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn give them more weight than lesser actors would. Silvia has a bizarre, unidentifiable accent. The character has one British and one white African parent. A South African accent would seem appropriate, but that's not what she has. The Matoban language \\"Ku\\", which Silvia translates, was created for the film at the South African Language Institute in London. It is a cross between Swahili, commonly spoken in East Africa, and Shona, a language of Southwestern Africa. \\"The Interpreter\\" is a suspense/thriller, so what the characters and audience don't know is what makes it work. Edmond Zuwanie's enemies may want him dead, but his supporters also want to prevent his speech at the UN, so it's anybody's guess which camp the assassin might come from. Silvia Broome is far from disinterested in the politics of Matobo, her home nation, but is she acting on her interests or her ideals? Those are the questions that keep everyone guessing. \\"The Interpreter\\" isn't a great thriller. It didn't have a script -or rather, the script was written as they were shooting, and it shows. But if you're looking for a reasonably entertaining film featuring talented stars, \\"The Interpreter\\" fills the bill. 3 ½ stars.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2005): Bonus features include a less probable Alternate Ending (3 minutes), 3 deleted scenes (2 minutes), 4 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In \\"Sydney Pollack at Work: From Concept to Cutting Room\\" (10 minutes), the director talks about what he likes about directing, the challenges of filmmaking, and shooting this film without a script. \\"Interpreting Pan & Scan vs. Widescreen\\" (5 minutes) is Pollack's explanation of why he objects to pan and scan. \\"The Interpreter\\" is the first film Pollack has shot in wide screen in a long time, as he felt compelled to shoot in full screen format because his movies were being panned and scanned for television and video. \\"The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations\\" (8 minutes) talks about shooting inside the UN building. \\"A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters\\" (8 minutes) is an interesting look at the challenges of simultaneous interpretation, explained by Diana Liao, Chief of the Interpretation Service at the UN, and Brigitte Andreassier-Pearl, Chief of the French section of the Interpretation Service at the UN. The audio commentary by director Sydney Pollack is sporadic, with long lulls, but it is interesting. Pollack discusses the intention of the scenes on which he comments, what he added after shooting and took out in editing and why, story, locations, and some technical challenges.

B00005JNJV|4.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" tries to revive the defunct Batman franchise that had become a caricature of itself under the direction of Joel Schumacher and some very bad scripts. This film is a complete departure in theme and style from the horrid \\"Batman Forever\\" (1995) and \\"Batman and Robin\\" (1997). It doesn't try to emulate the gothic visual style that director Tim Burton brought to \\"Batman\\" (1989) and \\"Batman Returns\\" (1992), but director Christopher Nolan's vision is just as dark. Whoever conceived of reviving the franchise decided wisely that the best place to start was at the beginning. So half of \\"Batman Begins\\" is backstory explaining how and why Bruce Wayne came to be a masked crime fighter and the origins of his preoccupation with bats.<br /><br />As a child, young Bruce Wayne witnessed the murder of his billionaire parents. Consumed by guilt and anger and reluctant to step into his father's prominent shoes as an adult, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) disappears without a trace. Seven years later, he returns to find Gotham City in the grip of a crime-ridden depression brought on by corrupt government and pillaging by crime boss Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), in cahoots with a mysterious out-of-town associate. Wayne reestablishes himself as a billionaire playboy with the help of his family's loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and takes a job in Wayne Enterprises' Applied Sciences department under the brilliant inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), where he finds good use for the high-tech military gadgetry that's been sitting around collecting dust.<br /><br />Christian Bale is the best Batman of the franchise. He can play a decadent playboy, a shrewd industrialist, and a brooding bat without sacrificing credibility. Bale's performance is more energetic and versatile than actors who took on the role previously. And he has more sex appeal than even George Clooney, which the female audience will appreciate. An hour of backstory might seem like too much, but several periods in Bruce Wayne's life are integrated coherently and generally well-paced. The exception is the time Wayne spends training in Asia under the tutelage of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). There is too much gibberish about conquering fear, the combat scenes are dull, and all of the film's worst lines have been dumped on Neeson.

B0006L16N8|4.0|If you're one interested in munching the latest proverbial pop music potato chip, you might be disappointed by this album. If, on the other foot, you enjoy expressive and non-trend music, you might, as I have, fall in love with X&Y. <br /> <br />Coldplay does an exceptional job making music that is new to the ears. Their music is dynamic. It is expressive. It encaptures the audience with its incredibly inspired melodies.  <br /> <br />Coldplay are masterminds with chord progressions. While most rock bands scratch their heads thinking of the next powerchord, Coldplay has successfully implemented many things such as modal progressions and chord borrowing to create irreplicable melodies. This, combined with a mature sound and flowing lines, is indeed a good thing. <br /> <br />But there is one criticism I have of Coldplay: their lyrics. The rhyme sequences often feel very forced. Also, the lyrics are very generalized and could apply to many things (which might be suitable to many people), but what are the true convictions behind the lyrics, the true meanings? <br /> <br />\\"Lights will guide you home <br />And ignite your bones <br />And I will try to fix you\\" <br /> <br />Perhaps the most professional band in the industry, Coldplay has striven to create that hard edge in the market. They have co-produced each of their albums, created their own promotional materials, restricted their songs from being used on television and films, and most importantly, developed their sound for the optimal live performance. <br /> <br />If one thinks Coldplay to be boring, I would suggest seeing them live. But let live such a pessimist. It is their own pleasure that suffers.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|ok i think this is the best cgi movie iv ever seen. the graphics where brilliant but its not the graphics that make the movie brilliant nor the music, its the story. story is most inportant to me in a film or game, and the story in advent children is brilliant. and i dont care what those other ppl said about the story, cos really, they wouldnt no a great film if it smaked them in the face. if you dont like the game thats fare. but if you like the game and dont like the movie the im sorry but your not a true fan. for all of you who liked the film and no what im talking about, id like to give you all a big hug.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|... what amazing music you can produce. I've been a Depeche Mode fan for probably about 5 years although I'd heard them before. I only found out about Playing the Angel a week or so ago and got really excited and the album did not disappoint me in any way. <br /> <br />It's useless arguing about why the album is good or not, everyone will have their own opinion and frankly, I found all the reviews intriguing in some way. That's just me. <br /> <br />I won't review every track, there's enough of that but my personal favourites are Precious (of course, a wonderful track and a great single), A Pain That I'm Used To, Lilian, Damaged People, Suffer Well (great job, Dave) and John the Revelator. The rest of the tracks I love too of course, I just had to pick a few! <br /> <br />Overall, it is somewhat reminiscent of Exciter even though most people don't seem to like that album, I personally love it even though it's different. As well as this one. <br /> <br />We can argue forever, let's just agree that DM are amazing and sleep peacefully at night!
6302752337|5.0|AMC broadcast Easy Rider shortly after the KATRINA disaster. Was this bad timing or brilliant programming?  <br />Easy Rider is, overall, a story about death. Capt. America (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), like a modern day Don Quixote, set out for Mardi Gras and the American Dream (freedom). <br />Instead, they wind up tripping in the Old Cemetery, with flashforwards to Capt. America's burning motorcycle. In the final campfire scene, Peter Fonda remarks, \\"We blew it\\". <br />The film represents the death of the American Dream; but, in respect to the KATRINA disaster, represents the death of New Orleans, and the Death of America itself in the aftermath of the hurricane. Capt. America comes to this realization, as did so many Americans in late August 2005, that \\"We blew it\\".  <br />So, was it just bad timing by AMC or extraordinarily brilliant programming? Watch the film for yourself.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Very good release from one of the my favorite bands. If you like so commercial album of DM as a Violator, miss this release. This album close to old analog synt.noise of music for the masses, some great reward, a little of black celebration, but in the direction of Songs of Faith and Devotion - My favorite album up to date. If you fan of the darkest side of DM, this release for YOU!
6303921248|5.0|Having seen every film version of Pride and Prejudice that one can obtain today, I definitely award the palm to this one, with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  The BBC version from 1982 is also charming; its TV-standard shortcomings in lighting, cinematography, and editing can be overlooked; but there is simply no comparison between Firth and David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy. <br /> <br />Colin Firth uniquely hits off the character of a very reserved man who is forced \\"out of himself\\" by attraction to an unexpected young woman.  Laurence Olivier was too suave and polished (as well as too old) to carry this off as well as Firth does, evoking more the air of an offended politician than an entrenched, unawakened country gentleman.  Rintoul in the 1982 version is suitably rough around the edges, but works too hard and displays too visibly Darcy's gradual thawing in the presence of Elizabeth Bennet.  Firth hides it better, as the character Darcy would have, while still letting the viewer in on the process. <br /> <br />I did enjoy Elizabeth Garvie in the 1982 version, but I was equally well satisfied with Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet.  If she did not come off quite as youthful as Garvie (Ehle was only in her late 20s when she made P&P), I find her more convincing as a girl who prizes wit and excels at it.  A delightful and very pretty actress, she seems well matched with her Mr. Darcy. <br /> <br />Most of the secondary characters are nicely done in this 1995 version, which has by far the best Mr. Bennet of any cinematic P&P.  Other stand-outs include Jane Bennet and Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  I preferred only one character from the 1982 version:  Mr. Collins, whose foolishness was better served by a large, doughy actor than the rather ferret-like (if hysterical) David Bamber in the '95 remake.  (A larger Mr. Collins is also, of course, truer to Austen's original.) <br /> <br />The grand scale on which the characters live in this version is probably not as true to Jane Austen's world as the environment created (on smaller budgets) in previous films.  In that sense the infusion of American money decried by some reviewers is regrettable; but it certainly makes for entertaining scenery.  Beyond an anachronistic freedom of manner in the younger Miss Bennets, the other questionable aspect of the social environment evoked in this version is the incessant curtseying and bowing by persons of all ages and social status.  I notice that American-oriented films depicting Regency England are usually replete with it, whereas films made by Brits for British audiences are not.
B00005NTN5|3.0|it was pretty clear to me early on that these dyke characters were written by a guy.  still, this was a decent mob movie with good dialogue and great visuals.  the whole movie was worth watching, but not owning unless you're the type to need a complete collection or want to watch the sex scenes over and over again.
1573223085|4.0|><br />This book, like [[ASIN:0446678791 Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself]] is written for people who live in an ivory tower, a gated community, or a corporate palace.  It is completely out of touch with the 90% of humanity that is comprised of the Working Poor in America, or the destitute and disenfranchised everywhere else.  For that it loses one star.<br /><br />However, and this is high praise from me, it is a \\"must read\\" for any knowledge worker, and I am particularly recommending it to the new breed of warrior in the U.S. Government, the Information Operations specialist.  A **major** part of our government's failure at foreign policy and national security--including its failure at homeland security and its mis-steps in the global war on terror, going back to the Viet-Nam era, can be traced to a combination of excessive reliance on \\"metrics\\" (remember the \\"body counts?\\") diluted by ideological preferences absent historical or cultural contexts.<br /><br />This book, while simplistic, is a superb over-view of the alternative methods of **perception**, integration, understanding, and outreach--empathy and strategic communication to others in terms they can \\"receive,\\" and for that reason I consider it a \\"must read.\\"<br /><br />The six senses, design, story-telling (see Steve Dunning), symphony, Empathy (none to be found in this White House), Play (intertwing work and play, mixing it up to energize both), and Meaning, are well covered by this book, and in a way that makes sense, where the value of listening is clear to the reader.<br /><br />It is a well-put-together book, with the right amount of white space, good illustrations, good notes and recommended readings, and over-all a pleasant and instructive contribution to my library and my reflections.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|with all the rave reviews i kept hearing i expected to really like this film.  unfortunately, it was a big waste of money and time.  the characters didn't have much chemestry other than overdramatic sadness and rage.  the one delightful exception was natalie portman who was a joy to watch.  every other scene drained my patience.  if you want to watch beautiful people cheating on each other, run out and see this movie.  otherwise save your money.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|I really love this CD. This CD gives me a lot of love, last night <br />I was listening to this record in the car, and I listened to Skateaway 5 times in a row. I really love this song Skateaway <br />one of my all time favorites, really nice start, really nice <br />lyrics, really nice music and song. I love the start saying \\"I <br />seen a girl on a one way corridor stealing down a one way street\\" <br />and other words like \\"she's making movies on location she don't <br />know what it means\\". And then I really love the last lyrics saying \\"Slippin in the slide, skateaway thats all, shala shala <br />hey hey skateaway, shala shala hey hey skateaway she's singing <br />shala shala hey hey skateaway\\" And I really love that ending so <br />bad. Anything that talks about girls and more, i love those songs. Skateaway and Expresso Love are my two all time favorites. <br />And then I love Tunnel of Love the opening track. Nice lyrics <br />and music, kicks off with \\"Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's <br />the life that I choose\\". And the end is really great in Tunnel <br />of Love. Then you also got Romeo and Juliet which is another great love song with \\"A lovestruck Romeo singing the streets <br />of serenade\\". I also really love Expresso Love because it is just <br />the same as Skateaway really nice song, nice start nice lyrics. <br />I love the part saying \\"Cause she was made in heaven, happens <br />in my world\\". And then I love the lyrics \\"hey my stroll, expresso <br />love\\". After that, you got Hand In Hand which is probably my <br />least favorite but still great. Solid Rock has some great lyrics <br />to it too, and the end with \\"SOLLLIIIIIIIIIIID ROCK\\". One of my <br />favorites on the album. The last track is Les Boys which isn't <br />really a bad album closer its great. I love the part where Mark <br />Knopfler sings \\"Les boys do cabernet, les boys are proud to be <br />gay\\". And then and the closing of the album it kinda repeats a <br />lot with \\"Les boys do cabernet, les boys are proud to be gay\\". <br />Anyway, that's it for this album, any rock fan who doesnt own <br />this is a moron or any Dire Straits fan who only owns Brothers <br />in Arms is a moron.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|To be a music purist and demand perfection.  Anytime you can see Eric play guitar, and see Cream on stage together, your life has taken one more step to its fulfillment.  This music is as good as it gets.  If you just listen to it without the video, you wont know these people are old enough to be your kids grandparents.  This is fresh, emotional and yes...having seen Cream a very long time ago, I got the lump in my throat as well. <br /> <br />Listen, remember, and enjoy.
B00004Y6NP|2.0|I'll say this is a bad CD because Why Worry is one of the saddest <br />songs I have ever heard saying \\"Baby, i know this world has made <br />you sad, some people can be bad\\" and other sad parts, the end <br />of that song is much better. The only good songs off this god <br />damn CD is probably the opener So Far Away with \\"Here I am again <br />in this mean old town\\" Money for Nothing with \\"I Want My MTV\\", <br />Walk of Life with \\"Here comes Johnny singing oldies goldies be <br />bop a lua baby what I say\\" and Brothers in Arms with \\"These miscovered mountains are only given for me\\". Anyone who thinks <br />this is Dire Straits' only good album should listen to bad junk <br />bands like Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, and AC/DC. Thanks.
0553278223|5.0|This short stories are as powerful today as they were when they were first published.  They have been seen on the TV screen and even a few have appeared in school books of mine.  They deal with racism, life, death, love, and even the environment.  Are we being shown the future or a reflection of our past?  Do the stories hold important truths or are they just stories?  No matter how you look at them, they are powerful, touching and, sometimes, ugly in how they show us ourselves.<br /><br />A must for ANY library.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|On Every Street, 1991 Dire Straits' sixth studio album and last. <br />I like this CD way better than Brothers in Arms. It is a lot simular to Making Movies while songs like Calling Elvis with <br />\\"Calling elvis is anybody home calling elvis i'm here all alone <br />did he leave the building can he come to the phone calling elvis <br />i'm here all alone\\" sounds simular to Romeo and Juliet. Heavy <br />Fuel with \\"Last time I was sober man I felt bad worst hangover <br />that I ever had it took six hamburgers and scotch all night, nicotine for breakfast just to put me right\\" sounds simular to <br />Skateaway two of my all time favorite DS songs. And the same for <br />My Parties with \\"Well this is my backyard, my backgate I hate to <br />start my parties late\\". The Bug with \\"well it's a strange old game you learn it slow, one step forward and it's back to go\\" <br />sounds a lot simular to Expresso Love and Tunnel of Love.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|Well this album blew me away. There are only a few \\"technical\\" death metal bands that I really like (and that are really THAT technical, for that matter). Nile, Hate Eternal, and Cryptopsy. I'm a fan of older material and it sounds pretty similar to me. So they didn't lose their sound, and that's a good thing.  <br /> <br />The production was odd I think, but I was nonetheless impressed. It took me a few spins to realize that the \\"nitty-gritty\\" drums pushed to the forefront, make the album more unique. The actual tuning of the toms have a very flat sound as well (almost sh**ty if you think about how drums usually sound). But that really sets this record apart. Flo is the most insane drummer ever and my personal favorite, but it doesn't take away from the insane riffage to compliment the former. Same style of complete tech death metal with nutso time signature changes, offbeat polyrhythms, and extreme layered complexities. Very textured album, done a little differently than usual. Lord worm is back. He's good and was always a bit different, but I don't bust a nut over his reentry. His lyrics are off the wall though. I can't tell if he's a genious, or just an insane idiot-sevant. I don't comprehend the lyrics, but apparently there is a conceptual theme. <br /> <br />If you like old Crytopsy, Nile, HE, and/or are looking for something a bit fresh/off the wall, then this album is defintely good to purchase. <br /> <br />Enjoy. <br />
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This is just as great as Making Movies. But more perfect. <br />The opening track is Telegraph Road which kicks off with \\"A <br />Long time ago came a man on a track walking thirty miles with <br />a sack on his back\\" which maybe my favorite from this album. <br />Next track is the big hit Private Investigations kickin in with <br />\\"It's a mistery to me, i gain comenses for a usual fee plus expenses\\". Then Industrial Disease which is a lot simular to <br />Expresso Love saying \\"Warning lights are flashing down at quality <br />control\\". Then the slow song, Love Over Gold which rocks with <br />\\"You walk out on the highwire, you're a dancer on thin ice\\" <br />And then my favorite last track closer is It Never Rains which <br />i don't know the lyrics to very well. Anyway great product better <br />together with Making Movies.
0316172324|3.0|In Blink, Gladwell assembles from many case studies, a strong argument for the amazing way we humans are hot-wired to make correct snap decisions based on minimal evidence. For sure, there are some astounding examples - of which the material on reading the micro-expressions of humans is the most illuminating. Clearly some people have a \\"facial literacy\\" that is quite astounding.<br /><br />But if you want to explore the reliability of the decisions we make in a blink of an eye, read up some of the writings of Kahneman and Tversky, who - on their way to winning a Nobel Prize - explored the perceptual and logical flaws commonly made by people. Or try the excellent prizewinning volume by Scott Plous: \\"The Psychology of Judgment and Decisionmaking\\" - which is a revealing look at our strengths and weaknesses in making judgments. In other words we're smart, but we're far from infallible. I feel Malcolm Gladwell could have balanced up his arguments somewhat without losing the immediate sense of marvel that he brings, so engagingly, to all his writing.<br /><br />Incidentally, another title you might check in this category is Sources of Power by Gary Klein, which looks at how people make decisions. I found this and Scott Plous' book a nice twin-act to go alongside Blink.
0393307050|5.0|Patrick O'Brian has thrilled countless readers with his 20-volume (plus an unfinished 21st novel) \\"Aubrey-Maturin\\" series of tales about life in the English navy during the glorious Age of Sail.   <br /> <br />\\"Master and Commander\\" is the first book in this beloved series, and it's easy to see why generations of readers have flocked to O'Brian's works.  In Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, O'Brian created one of the timeless \\"buddy\\" teams in fiction.  Jack Aubrey, captain of the British naval sloop Sophie, is a splendid combination of swashbuckler, glutton, and loyal soldier, as likely to stumble drunkenly over his feet and tongue on land as he is to tackle an enemy ship twice the Sophie's size.  Dr. Maturin, on the other hand, is a naval and military novice, but is a man of considerable learning and hidden derring-do.  Sharing a love for adventure and music as well as a mutual respect, Aubrey and Maturin complement each other swimmingly. <br /> <br />O'Brian has written these tales in an archaic British-naval style that is long on jargon and short on context, and \\"M&C\\" is filled with jarring shifts of scenes.  This is not to say that \\"M&C\\" is poorly written!  On the contrary, O'Brian may have a unique style, but the style undeniably works.  Allow yourself to get whisked away by the rhythm of O'Brian's prose, refuse the temptation to look up every obscure naval term in the dictionary, and trust the author to take you to the right place, and you will have a heck of a time with this book. <br /> <br />While \\"M&C\\" is heavy on the action, O'Brian fills \\"M&C\\" with passages of surprising beauty and humor.  Several long passages are devoted to the exotic beauty of life at sea, from sunrises and sunsets to the fine lines a ship cuts as it glides over the waves.  And you will find yourself chuckling out loud as Maturin lectures Captain Jack on his obesity (let's agree that Hollywood was rather kind to Jack by casting Russell Crowe), or when Jack is pelted by a \\"biological missile\\" from one of the famed Apes of Gibraltar.   <br /> <br />To be sure, \\"M&C\\" can be a bit confusing at times, since O'Brian presumes that the reader has a solid grounding in both the geography of the Mediterranean as well as an understanding of Britain's friends and foes during this period.  While this background may help (and a nearby wallmap never hurts), never fear.  You do not need to be a student of British naval history to thoroughly enjoy this book.  His characters and their struggles are universal and entertainingly presented.   <br /> <br />A must-read for Anglophiles as well as fans of historical fiction.  Check it out, and it will be impossible for you not to pick up volume 2 (at least).
1594200696|5.0|Strunk and White's Elements of Style is the absolute classic guidebook to grammar and to clear writing. It is underpinned by a simple philosophy of making every word count. The paperback edition resides on millions of desks world-wide: a wise guide to people who appreciate words and clear communication.<br /><br />But here's a hardback edition, beautifully illustrated. Why not just go for the paperback? The answer is  because Elements of Style has become much more than a reference text: it is an icon, and this edition is like a glorious piece of birthday cake that celebrates the fact that we've been in the presence of a faithful and inspiring servant for almost 50 years. Elements of Style is a classic that retains a resilient role even (or especially) in this age of txt.<br /><br />If you love artful writing, buy a copy for yourself. For any friend who cherishes the written word, this book is the perfect gift. It allows us to stop, to marvel and to appreciate the power of simple truths, well told.

The story of Charlie Bucket with his family and Willy Wonka to the orbit of earth is really imaginary good! <br />It's very creative. About the pills, it's really original good. I even never think about it! You're really good Roald. I love it. I'd give score 9.8! Highly recommend.

B000B2YQX4|4.0|The industrial 80's are BACK!!!  The subtitle on the back cover says it all:  \\"PAIN AND SUFFERING IN VARIOUS TEMPOS\\"  Each song on the album builds on the other, mixing Dave Gahan's achingly poweful vocals over a soundscape of budding synthesizers.  Singled out, \\"John the Revelator\\" is probably the best song on the CD.  Other notable songs include current single \\"Precious\\", \\"The Sinner in Me\\" and \\"Lilian.\\"  Disappointed there are no songs on here resembling \\"Dream On\\" or \\"I Feel Loved\\" from 'Exciter', at first listen the CD will immediately take you back to days of  masterpiece 'Violater'.  Though the change is welcome, I am looking forward to the massive remixes DJ's should be coming out with to these lush songs.

B00005YU1O|4.0|Okay it was intellecually stimulating, but those who exault this movie into a some \\" super movie\\" if you will,are really pushing it. The first time you see it you will see that it throws alot at you and the things that stick are so very intresting, to ponder. What is life how do you know its not a drem. and so forth. but I reccommend that you watch it several times and I garentee each time something new will stick... but I have to say if you got a group of friends together and disscused after each scene, you will get the most out of the movie it really awakens the mind.One quick word of advice you cannot day dream while you watch the movie you REALLY have to WATCH the movie or you will find your self watching it for four hours because you had to rewind so much to understand what was going on... The only thing that I didnt like was the movement of backrounds with the animation at some points it really gets distracting but you'll live. Buy it its a great movie
B00003CX5P|1.0|I'm not sure when it was.. 10 minutes in, 20.. when the creeping, utterly unwanted thought came into my head the first time I watched this film - \\"oh no.. it's really, really BAD.\\"<br /><br />Fair enough, few films could meet the hype and expectations that THIS one had, but it must have took some considerable skill to screw it up THIS much. As a bog-standard sci-fi adventure, it's average. Looks mighty nice, sure, but there's nothing there. The one promising character (Darth Maul) is in it for about four minutes, and the rest are bland cardboard cut-outs - all except one, which we'll get to later. As a Star Wars movie, which gave us Han Solo, Boba Fett, the Death Star, Jabba, Darth Vader, speeder bikes and countless other iconic moments which are engrained on a whole generations minds - it's borderline criminal.<br /><br />There is none of the flair of the first movies, no witty one-liners, no quoteable moments - and absolutely ZERO chemistry between any of the characters. For what it could have been, and for what has went before it, it really could be one of the worst films ever made.<br /><br />One of the main characters who helps this film garner that accolade? Step forward Jar Jar Binks. Was he supposed to be funny? Loveable? I don't know - because every time I see him I want to hurt kittens. Every time I hear him I want to shoot puppies. The most loathsome, teeth-nashingly AWFUL character in the history of movies, he nontheless takes up CHUNKS of movie time - falling over! Talking in a stupid voice! Stepping in dung! You'll laugh till you slit your wrists.<br /><br />I guess this is what happens when you become TOO powerful. George Lucas seriously needed someone to whisper into his ear, \\"you know, George.. maybe we need a drastic re-think, here\\".<br /><br />But alas, that wasn't to be. So we have the turgid first part, the arguably worse second part and the good third part, before we can get onto the REAL Star Wars movies.<br /><br />Because this?

0062502182|5.0|To start with, I read it when I was about to take one of the most important decisions in my life.  It was simply a coincidence since the book had been with me for long and I never cared to read it.  The moment I read it, I took a bold decision.  I cant say it is an easy decision, but I am satisfied that I followed my heart.  It is well written, simple to the core, inspiring, and motivating.  It is book that you can read many times - just open any page and read for as long as you care.  There is no story element to the book and that makes it the best companion for me. <br />I have read many reviews about the book saying its not 'wisdom' and its 'common sense'.  To me, guys, common sense IS wisdom!  The writer never tells you that he is going to tell you anything new.  After so many holy books throughout the history of human kind, there is not really much 'new' someone can preach you.  It is how you put that in the context.  I really loved the way he put it in simple words.  It helped me a lot and hope for the same for all you guys.
B0006399FS|5.0|I just can't see how people, especially long-time U2 fans, don't like this album. In my opinion this is second only maybe to 'Pop'. It blows away 'All That You Can't Leave Behind', and that album was already pretty good. <br />As far as I'm concerned, there is only one bad song on it- 'All Because of You'. The rest are great if not amazing. 'City of Blinding Lights' is probably the best thing they've ever done.  <br />As far as Bono's voice- it seems like it's better than it's ever been. He can and does get all the notes, at least once- he's just not afraid to keep one or two mistakes. Give the man some credit. <br />I can't wait for the follow-up.
B000B9EY2U|5.0|This is the dark angel we have anticipated for some time. I don't want to knock the past few albums, as I believe that Depeche has never released a bad album. They are all profound works of art that capture in their unique ways snapshots from the skilled brain of Martin Gore followed by the haunting, soothing baritone of Dave Gahan. Ultra and Exciter are lush, polished epics that allowed the boys to spread their wings and fly freely without their musical wunderkind anchor, Alan Wilder. For instance, \\"Angel of Night\\" is one of the most gorgeous and enduring songs ever written. \\"Dream On\\" is pure lyrical genius. However, this new work, in total, captures the brilliant edginess and completeness of Black Celebration; and then transcends it in so many ways.<br /><br />Introspectre is a soothing Christmas Island. John The Revelator: pure exhilarated biblical/mythic rock. Precious: a haunting ode to the preservation of innocence. Lilian: a sumptuous romantic swing through ecstasy. Macro: a modernized Alan Watts' joyous cosmology. Each song carries a world unto itself that opens up new vistas with every listen.<br /><br />I have read that Martin Gore's recent divorce has colored these songs with imprints of pain, and concern for his children. Fame and fortune are no safeguards against the harshness of life; though there is a real sense of hopefulness that emerges, despite the pain. Depeche Mode has always been a band of \\"electronic Bodhisattvas\\" mining their own psyches and dabbling in the darker realms of consciousness to reveal universal truths; and ultimately, celebrate the good and the joy that is in the world. This work of \\"pain and suffering in various tempos\\" proves to be another masterpiece from a band that chose to go to the core of what they were about since the beginning: making machines into tools of the human nervous system while fleshing out the nuances of the human condition in beautiful melodies...to accompany the voice in humanizing us. How lovely an album they have created after all these years. The black celebration has never really ended, while blasphemous rumors can now be squelched.<br /><br />Depeche Mode has returned in all their harmonic glory with new spiritual offerings to move us deeply. Their eternal appeal is shining on and on.n album they have created after all these years.

B000002UJQ|5.0|This, in my mind, is Radiohead's best album. The Bends just has a couple wholes in it, whereas OK Computer is brilliant from top to bottom. The album is all over the place. This is best shown in the song, Paranoid Android, where the songs starts off fast, slows down for a beautiful middle section, and then out of nowhere cuts out to the screams of a guitar. My favorite songs on this album are Exit Music, Let Down, No Surprises, Climbing Up The Walls, and Karma Police. This album is a must have for anyone with an appreciation for good music.
0394806220|5.0|I first picked this book up at our library and my daughter loved it. She brought it to me to read several times everyday while we had it so I bought it for christmas. The sounds you have to say really get your child interested and wanting to listen to the whole book. She repeats some of the sounds too. This book is a good educational toy for speech and keeping a childs attention. My daughter goes around saying MOOOOOOOO all the time now. I think it is cute.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|One of the reasons I purchased this special edition DVD was for the 3 music videos by Prince.  What a disappointment to find that the Partyman video is truncated!  As far as I'm concerned, that would have been the best music video in the package if it wasn't cut short.  Nothing's perfect, I suppose.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Influences from Guns 'n Roses and power metal bands can be heard throughout the album. Awesome melodies and harmonies. Guitarwork is very polished, and the production quality on the album has been much improved over previous work. Every song is perfectly listenable, but with a few gems: <br /> <br />-Sidewinder, especially the flamenco solo at the end. <br />-Trashed and Scattered. Very catchy melodies and harmonies. <br />-Strength of the World, 9 minute 'epic' <br />-Beast and the Harlot, perfect way to introduce the album. <br /> <br />Of course, there is no album that is perfect for EVERYONE. The vocals are hard for many people to accept (I think they sound fine. Nothing great but at least he isn't Alexi Laiho). This album will NOT please former A7X fans who liked ONLY their screaming from Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. It is not a metalcore album, and it is definitely not a hardcore album (a7x were never hardcore). It's just an awesome piece of metal music. Listen to it if you appreciate good musicianship.
B000AY807Q|5.0|I have been a Neil Young fan since the early 70's.  This is a great CD, every song is wonderful. If you are a Neil Young fan, you have to listen to this one.  Classic Neil all the way.  Thanks Neil for some more great music!!
B000AL730O|1.0|It seems as though Mr McCartney has fallen victim to the illness of uninspired music. This album is just plain bad. Not atrocious, not horrible, just bad. <br />  <br />I've tried to listen to it repeatedly for weeks, but it just seems like work.  <br />The main body of the songs are bland, forgettable and worst of all, badly produced. There's none of the pop (both in musical style and in production) of any of his previous work. The songs just lay there. <br /> <br />If it weren't for some of the better bridge sections of the recordings, I'd have tossed it into the bin faster. <br />If this were a new artist, we'd have forgotten it long ago, but it's Sir Paul, so we're forced to sit and wait for something good to appear between the grooves. It doesn't happen. <br />I love Macca and have most of his solo work, my favorites being Ram, Red Rose Speedway, Flowers in the Dirt, and Venus and Mars. This mess doesn't measure up to half of any of them. In fact, if you haven't any of his work, start with any of those. You'd be MUCH better suited.
B000002J1U|5.0|zep decided to get a bit experimental with this album. sick of churning out the same kind of music in the last two records, they went acoustic with this one. this record took me a little while to get into but now I can easily say this is my favourite Zep album. As with all other Zep albums on amazon this has ben extensively and brilliantly reviewed and trust me all the accolades are well deserved. <br /> <br />Long live Jimmy Page.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I remember the 1st time I watched this movie it had touched me. Shortly after watching it I had introduced it to my husband and we watch it together every time we wanted to respark are love for one another. No movie has ever come close to way this makes you look at taking life for granted.Thank god for alowing people to see beyond this everyday life we seem to fall into. <br />persons from escanaba michigan
B000001FDQ|5.0|although the genre is metal, but this is not one of your **oohhhh lets headbang to the deadpoundingly fast music** kind of records. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a masterpiece in music and records such significant and mammothly significant are made once in a lifetime. The ideal setting to listen to this album is in a dark, cool room, unperturbed by anything, and RELAXED. Yngwie will then take you to a journey which you'll never forget, every track is brilliant par excellence, there is not even one sub-standard song, the vocals, the drums, the bass, the keys and yes the guitar, they are just PERFECT. <br /> <br />and anyone who says you need to be a guitar nerd to understand and appreciate the album is just a moron. For the, so to say, musically *uneducated* this might seem to be random notes playd here and there the first time but listen to it 3-4 times and you are guaranteed to be swept away by the, one and only, ever amazing Mr. Yngwie Johann Malmsteen.
0743487583|1.0|I have to add this to the top of the list of books that I have had to read but HATED! Let's see it was up there with Call of the Wild, The Odyssey, Farenheit 451, The King Must Die, True Grit, When the Legends Die, etc...I think you get my point. It is as if the teachers and district pick the worst possible books. Frankenstein has SOOO much potential to be great, however it falls abysmally short. I am sad to say that I had to read this horrible book front to back without the option of throwing it in the fireplace like I was so longing to do. We even had to read the lame(for lack of better word) letters at the beginning. Our teacher said that most teachers don't make their students read those--I guess he is not one of those teachers.
1572814136|5.0|I'm new at this, and decided to try a standard deck of Tarot cards.  I really liked this deck, the pictures were coloful and clear, and the cards were covered with thin shiny plasticky layer, so they are very durable.  All together, nice deck, much larger than regular cards, and feels nice in a hand.
B000AL730O|1.0|One of the most boring cd's I have ever listened to. The only time I will ever listen to it again is if I have trouble falling asleep. Quite a difference from his live performances which are very good. Slow, monotonous, boring songs. He needs his live band to kick him into gear on his next studio album instead of trying to do everything himself.  If it did not have Paul McCartney's name on the cover the critics would dismiss it entirely. At least plug in the electric guitar and include a couple of rockers. 13 straight slow ones is enough to bore anyone.
B00005TT77|3.0|I was not quite as impressed with this album as some of the other reviewers. I will say that the \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\" cover by Eddie Vedder is better to me than the original Beatles version! However, this is sadly not the case with most of the songs. I found that many of the songs are ok but really not as good as the originals; for instance Lucy in the Sky and Let it Be which are two of my all time Beatles favorites. Many of the covers fail to leave any lasting impression at all and the rest are notable for being pretty bad. I enjoyed this soundtrack a lot more when I was watching the movie!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I love nearly everything DT has done over the years, but only two things about the band have consistently annoyed me: Labrie's sometimes-shrill vocal delivery, and their occasionally-awkward and pretentious lyrics.  That's why I, like so many other DT fans of my ilk, enjoyed the two LTE albums so much.       I was pleasantly surprised to find that Labrie is much more restrained here, sounding the best I think he ever has, and the lyrics are - for the most part - the best they've ever written, imho.    Of course, for most DT fans, it's all about the music.  You will not be disappointed here.  Unlike the Metalicca-ish sound on their last album, this one owes more to Floyd, Iron Maiden, Rush, a little Muse, and of course, DT themselves.  The title track sounds like old Genesis on steroids.  The keyboards are back up in the mix where they should be (they were almost entirely buried in the mix on the last disc).  The riffs, jams and solos are absolutely killer!       The boys continue to astound and amaze.  Long live DT!
B000B9EY2U|5.0|Playing the Angel is Depeche Mode's strongest offering since the all-mighty Songs of Faith and Devotion in 1993 and features pin-point songwriting reminiscent of their cold, yet loving epic Black Celebration... and yet it's just as catchy as their most popular offering, Violator. <br /> <br />The only fault I could see others finding with the ablum is that it contains only a few lyrical emotions, yet the band had the sense of humor to mock this in the packaging themselves \\"PAIN AND SUFFERING IN VARIOUS TEMOPOS\\" and anyone expecting 'Mode to come out with an album about magical faeries or Strawberry Fields fails to understand that \\"PAIN AND SUFFERING\\" would qualify as (in Martin Gore's own words) \\"their M.O.\\" The songwriting however, cannot be faulted. <br /> <br />Each song is melodic, memorable and moving. From the slap-back and open guitar that grew on us with Violator to the analogue synthesis that was vacant from \\"Exciter\\" and the production served up by Harper, it's a complete package that almost rivals \\"Black Celebration\\" (though not quite, as the production on B.C. is damn near impeccable with each song musically flowing into each other, literally). <br /> <br />The end result is a lenghty, dark, dancable and highly memorable album that could very well be the single best comeback album since David Bowie's \\"Reality\\".
B00079ZACM|5.0|The 1939 Zoltan and Alexander Korda production of The Four Feathers is one of the greatest adventure movies ever.  Accept no substitutes -- especially the 2002 version with Heath Ledger as a totally anachronistic Harry Faversham.  That one was shot somewhere with a lot of sand, but it wasn't the Sudan.  In addition to an exciting and cohesive plot, one of the factors that make this 1939 version so extraordinary is the authenticity of production.  In 1939, \\"shot on location\\" meant filming where the story actually took place, not, as now, just outdoors in a place that resembles the story's setting.  Then, \\"location\\" meant the Sudan, which the British still controlled. The British soldiers were played by the contemporary British Army garrison in Cairo, with correct uniforms and weapons drawn from quartermaster warehouses and arsenals where they had been preserved for decades.  Moreover, the Khalifa's Sudanese warriors were played by sons of men who had fought the British 41 years before at Omdurman; indeed, it is likely that some of the oldest Sudanese extras were veterans of that battle.<br /><br />Although in many respects -- and not just in uniforms and weapons -- the book and the movie were products of their time and place, certainly people today still grapple with questions of service to their country and competing loyalties to family, not to mention self-doubt and bravery.  These are central themes of this movie and are handled very well.  In 1939, of course, the British were facing the terrible dangers posed by Hitler, giving the movie special relevance to theater patrons.<br /><br />I've had the VHS version for years and this DVD is a welcome improvement in clarity of picture, color and sound.  However, I agree with those who have complained about the chintzy packaging of the DVD: no bios of the stars, no liner notes or even a scene list.  That's not the fault of the Kordas but of the present-day cheapskates at MGM.  And the DVD jacket notes were obviously jotted down on the back of a leaflet at some anti-war rally by someone who had not seen this movie at all.  These are annoyances and disappointments, but they don't detract from the story or the movie production.<br /><br />Having read the book by A.E.W. Mason, I can say this is one of those rare instances (like \\"Goldfinger\\") where the movie is better than the book.  Those who choose to project contemporary attitudes back many decades will sniff or gasp at this movie and the standards and mores it portrays.  So be it.  I suspect that if C. Aubrey Smith (as General Burroughs) were still around, Queen Elizabeth II would even now be toasted as \\"Queen Empress\\" in British regimental messes.jotted down on the back of a leaflet at some anti-war rally by someone who had not seen this movie at all.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This is a stunning movie any way you look at it. I spent more than 100 hours on the game but think this is stil a good movie even if you're not an origional fan. I have it in direct tranlation, 'correct enlish grammar' translation, and heard the fully english version will be out in early 2006. They are redoing all the lip animation so it will not be an english dub. Can't wait!
B00004YZFR|3.0|This is an interesting, perhaps even a historically significant, film, but it definitely is not one of the better *music* DVDs out there. The sound is great, but the  Stones are out of tune with each other and with themselves, they consistently miss changes and flub endings, and the other performers are even worse. <br /> <br />Get Your Ya-Ya's Out is a much better buy and one of the best live rock recordings. Of course, it's cherry-picked from the Stones' entire tour and not a single concert.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|There isn't much in the way of superlatives that I can say about NORTH BY NORTHWEST that can't already be found among the other reviews here. Bear with me while I simply point out the following:<br /><br />This is an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Hitchcock is regarded by many as the best movie-maker of the twentieth century. Furthermore, NBNW is is not just any Hitchcock movie, it's generally considered one of his best.<br /><br />The story begins with a classic case of mistaken identity in which our hero (played by Cary Grant) gets caught up in a case of international espionage. As the story unfolds, it's hard to be sure who can be trusted and who can't. The plot twists and turns, carrying the viewer on a roller-coaster ride from city to countryside and from the east coast to the Dakotas. The cast is excellent, several of the scenes are among the most memorable in cinematic history, the background scenery is often spectacular, and the music builds on the story's shifting moods extremely well.<br /><br />NBNW is a genuine Hollywood classic. The American Film Institute currently has in the fortieth position on its list of the 100 greatest movies and it's in the fourth spot in the sub-category of the 100 greatest movie thrillers.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock made a slew of great movies. While a few (i.e. PSYCHO, THE BIRDS) are probably better known, NBNW and REAR WINDOW are my personal favorites. Both are simply excellent. Coincidentally, the proprietors of this web page are currently offering NBNW and REAR WINDOW together as a package deal. If I didn't already own both flicks, I'd be all over that. So, this is your chance to pick up two great movies in one quick purchase. My advice? Don't miss out. Get both. You won't be sorry.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet, as most everyone reviewing this album has already sung every wonderful, brilliant praise that could be mentioned about it. OK Computer remained my favorite album for around two or three years, unmatched by anything, and now it rests only below Jeff Buckley whom I discovered at the beginning of college in 2001. This album is an anthem of beauty, melody, and innovation. Every song is wonderful (with the personal exception of Fitter Happier which has always creeped me out)--definitely something to include in every musical collection of those who truly like escapism and melodically lush and moving soundscapes.
B00004VVN9|5.0|Brainstorm~ Douglas Trumbull is a movie that tells the story about a team of scientist headed that have created a machine that can record memories. Natalie Wood and Christopher Walken play their roles with vigor and resolve. Walken is amazing in the role as the scientist and Wood plays the role of his wife very well indeed. The technology does look quite ancient but the idea to store memories still has not been achieved. The special effects also look quite cheap and as if they were put on a tight budget. The ethical question raised and the intelligent dialogue and script make up for this. The movie also lacks a good soundtrack and the music in the movie is minimal and that could have been something that they could have put a bit more time and effort on. Apart from this, Brainstorm is a delightfull movie that is still very relevent and has amazing actors in it. Not to be missed.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I love this album.So glad too see the boys back. This album has a harder edge too it. I love the song precious it rules. I also love the song suffer well wow. Im just happy they keep making music. It may not be as good as albums past, but their music is still better than most. Keep it up.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|how are people hearing this album, then saying its not good because shadows cant do his chuck schuldinger-vocal anymore? how are people picking it up then dissing the musicmanship? just proves how some people are so skewed... <br /> <br />this being said from a modern metal fanatic. i adore a7x, along with shadows fall, fear factory, trivium, god forbid, chimaira, and even some lamb of god. but i also listen to metallica, opeth, nile, even mayhem, emperor, and angelcorpse, so one could possibly say i have a little knowledge of metal, right? <br /> <br />then trust me, just trust me, that if you open your mind when you listen to city of evil, you will find one of the most original and amazing metal albums released this millenium! (and one of the best of the year...and this year we have had an unprecedented explosion of commercially viable yet completely non-sellout metal- from ghost reveries to constitution of treason)  <br /> <br />first thing that you'll notice- m. shadows can no longer do his death vox-but heres why- he had throat surgery. its not as if it was a consious decision to drop them, people. i'm going to say this in capitals, so all can see this:  <br /> <br />THEY ARE NOT SELLING OUT BY NO LONGER DOING DEATH VOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br /> <br />that being said, the album is amazing. beast and the harlot simply grinds then gets much faster...but forget a track by track analysis-to put it simply, you will not be dissapointed by a single one of the 11 tracks here. i personally love the first 5 tracks and the wicked end more...but thats just personal preference. <br /> <br />oh and if you didnt take this from earlier tour de forces like eternal rest from waking the fallen (which is a must hear, especially if you think this album isnt heavy enough), ZACKY VENGEANCE IS AMAZING. his leads here are EVEN BETTER than the leads from waking the fallen! his amazing precision and above all INSANITY-INDUCING melodical mastery are what really put this album on a higher plain. just check out the riffs- my personal favorite is the lead 10 seconds into burn it down... good christ... <br /> <br />knocks against the album- the lyrics leave something to be desired, i really liked the lyrics on waking the fallen...here they seem to more generally teenage angsty...sidewinder simply gets off to a slow start...and the ballads dont really break the amazing new ground that the thrashers do. <br /> <br />simply put, this is an AMAZING hybrid of disparate styles...skater punk, thrash metal, early wave of british heavy metal...so fans of not only metallica but green day, guns n' roses, iron maiden or even trivium will LOVE THIS. not just a must buy for a metalhead- a must buy for most any fan of modern rock. enjoy.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay is becoming one of my favorite groups. I grew up listening to rem depeche mode u2 etc. Thes guys are right in there with those bands. I love the kraftwerk influence on white shadows. This album made me dust off my kraftwerk cd's and relisten. I love this album.
B000AJJNOK|3.0|I originally bought this CD, didn't like it, reviewed it, and gave it 2 stars.  I recently recieved this special edition for my birthday.  At first I was extremely disappointed, as I already had the album and didn't think the DVD could save this release. But it does. <br />50's videos have alway been of a high quality.  So to get 21 new ones on one DVD is a very good thing.  All the videos are of the high quality you expect from him, and compliment the songs well.  It was a good decision to re-release thise as a CD/DVD combo.  If you haven't bought 'The Massacre' yet, make sure you get it with the DVD.  It doesn't make it an instant classic, but it helps it scrape in for 3 stars.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|This album is not as good as their last. However its got some really good songs. Standouts for me are marching bands of manhatten, your heart is an empty room. I love these too the rest is pretty good.
0385336810|3.0|OK, this is my 2 cents worth of psycho-analysis for this plot: <br /> <br />1) Emma Coorigan, a young 25 year old marketing assistant at Panther Corporation, is starving severely from \\"father attention deficiency\\" syndrome, so she falls for a much older Jack Harper, as the alter father figure. Jack being the big shot founder of Panther Corporation. <br /> <br />2) Jack Harper shamelessly practices sexual harassement at his workplace by shooting Emma lecherous glances and spouting sexual inneundoes.  <br /> <br />3) A university educated Emma is pathetically lacking in critical thinking skills, how did she get the job in the first place? <br /> <br />Ha, ha, just kidding sisters, leave your brains behind when you read this, its simply for pure entertainment. Though I think, Robyn Sisman & Sarah Mason, both chick lit authors, can do much better plots and wittier exchanges than this book! <br /> <br />This is going to be made into a movie, check imdb and u will see that a screenplay is in the works. If I were the casting director, I'll take Kate Winslet as Emma Corrigan (cos she's a British actress though not quite 25 in real age but airbrushing would do it!!) and George Clooney as Jack Harper(cos he's American & much older and in real life age is about 43+).
B000007WNN|5.0|If you want to go crazy put this on. Good for workouts.My favorite cult album.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I absolutely love this album! its so different and innovative. when you're listening to it, it almost sounds like a soundtrack; any of their songs would work great in a movie. my personal favorite is 40'; great beat, great lyrics, great song. i highly recommend this album to anyone who even likes just one of their songs, you wont be disappointed.
B000002LK1|5.0|One of the best alt dance albums ever. This is my second favorite d-mode albums 1st is black celebration. This has one of d-modes best songs ever policy of truth.
B0009S3HI0|5.0|This is the history of the greatest rock band to walk on surface of Earth. Every Deftones Album is a blown away experience that you`ll aways remember. This one is a collection of their very rare covers and others tunes, besides all their videos. I think this cd will throw fans back on the early days and back to present again with some great stuff. And after this gift the only thing that`s missing is a LIVE DVD wich would be very well accepted by the fans all over the world.
B00008VGL6|3.0|its not the best album but who cares its still depeche mode and theire music rules. There are a couple of good songs though. Anything Martin Gore or anyone from depeche puts out I will buy it.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I had to watch this movie twice the first time.  It was so confusing I had to sit down and write out a flow chart of who was who and what each connection was to each other.  That was the only way I could even attempt to grasp this huge conspiracy theory. <br /> <br />This is Michael Moore's masterpiece, a throughly researched and picked apart documentary of how September 11th could have would have should have and how it's lead to our Iraq occupation.  After having watched this, I didn't feel one way or another about it.  I don't feel conspired against, I don't feel deceived, and I don't feel angry.  It was clear to me after the Gulf War of the early 90s that we thought there was going to be a revolution and Saddam Hussein would be ousted by his own people, but it didn't happen.  We were wrong, it was a lightening war, and now our gas prices are through the roof.  We thought that we were going to find Ousama Bin Lauden quickly, we haven't yet.  And, perhaps most importantly of all, Michael Moore wanted to vote out George W Bush, and he didn't. <br /> <br />Having looked back on all these things, I am rather amazed yet at the same time I feel an odd understanding of things.  The reason I do not give this movie 5 stars is because it is a personal attack against George W and not truly against his political stance.  On the day that the towers were hit, he was in an elementary school class and they timed his reaction once the news was whispered to him.  If I were him, I would sit there with a blank look on my face too.  Who's in charge here?  I AM.  I'd just be glad I didn't wet my pants.  He likes to portray George as stupid, I don't believe he's stupid.  And when I am looking at the state of the economy I don't blame him for it unlike everyone else.  I blame myself, like a lot of others should do.  You choose so many things for yourselves, world.  You blame George for your state of unemployment, rising costs, and dwindling finances, but those who yell the loudest don'tget off their lazy asses and put our shoulders to the wheel.   <br /> <br />And, I write this long after George won the second election.  That I was shocked at, because the people seemed so angry.  But why did he win again when Michael Moore made such an effort to call for a coupe?  Because people are angry, but they don't care enough to vote.  I was amazed as angry as people are that they simply do not care. <br /> <br />Still, this is a good movie.  Michael Moore did a fine research project inflected with his black humor.  It's a good time.  Power to the people.
B000002UVZ|5.0|1'st off rem is my favorite group. This is my fav from them. This is propably my fav album off all time. This album was given too me in 8th grade by a guy who said if you like punk you will like this album. Well it's not punk but I have loved rem ever since. I think this album should go down as one of the best ever.
B00004TJTS|4.0|ALoha, havent gotten it. I think you may of not been able to find it and let me know and promptly resent price. I hope so. you have a very good review and I cant help but think you would of dont the same for me. Hope one day to deal with you again for this movie ,cant find in stores on big island and its one of my favorites. Let me know if you have. (...)nice people aloha mrs karpik
B0007GAERG|5.0|She has one of the best vocal ranges in the music industry ....Mariah came back determined to prove all those who doubted her wrong ..Every single on this cd..proves she never lost touch with her audience ..Thanks Mariah for putting together an amazing cd that you can play from the begining to the end.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|There are very few movies I would suggest are perfect, but this one is and I'll tell you why.  Sure, by now you know the story line, the way cool Batmobile and a great telling of what has become a classic legend, all grown up from comic books, and evolved into a sort of Greek hero figure like Hercules or Achilles.  What makes the movie great is that it makes the story great.  Really great.  One of the wonders of childhood is when you begin to understand that sometimes a story is just that and nothing more. Then something wonderful happens to that transitional imagination.  You WANT it to be true.  Remember when you used to wish that there really was a place called OZ and dreamed that you could fly(just like Superman)even though you knew better?  Think back.  That's why this is a perfect movie.  Because the vision of this movie is that there really, really COULD be a Batman. You even want there to be one.  All of the gizmos and costumes are necessary, even required.  Further they are all plausible, and made so by justifying every single part of the Batman, even the cape, as essential parts of his battle outfit.  What kid didn't run around the yard or basement donning the cape of his favorite superhero?  What grownup wouldn't like to get his hands on this one, converting yourself into an ultralight flying person (at least if you jump off a very high place).  For the U.S. Army- parachutes out Bat capes in.  Oops, almost gave away one of the moviemakers' secrets.  If you have ever gotten weary of doing all the work to suspend your disbelief to believe in a movie or a story, then you are in for a big, big treat.  You won't have to because you'll come to the end of the movie just a little bit different.  A grown-up who CAN believe that there are heroes in the world, and maybe, just maybe tomorrow on CNN they'll be telling you about a real Batman fighting crime in New York, and everybody trying to find out if it's for real or just a joke.  I'll just bet you'll smile a little over your coffee and say \\"Sure. It's true.  He probably saw the movie.\\"  And you'll understand what being a child is like all over again.  You Will Believe!
B000002KHB|5.0|The first thing to state about Machine Head is that if any group were to release an album of this calibre today you would not be able to avoid hearing about them in the media. But the fact is that no group today will release an album like this, not even come close. The main reason for this is quite simple; this album was a product of a different age where the motivation was to create music that was a form of exploration and which, when it was at it's best, pushed the boundaries of what was possible.  That simply does not happen anymore where far too many groups and musicians are in the music business because it is a career option and a means to make money, and not because they have any understanding of, or sensitivity to the fact that music might be a path to knowledge. Suffice to say that Machine Head blows away anything around today by a country mile and in another 30 years time will sound just as good if not better than what is going to be around then if current trends are anything to go by. No point in giving individual reviews of the songs because the album should be taken as a complete package and as such it is a razor sharp statement of metal integrity.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I love South Park and don't mind raunchy humor, but I turned this one off before it was over. Couple of chuckles (theme song was good for a chuckle), and a few good barbs at world leaders, but overall a snoozefest. Just because you make can make puppets have sex and say the f-word doesn't make it funny. I can't imagine what most of the reviewers here saw in this movie to give it 5 stars.
B000AL730O|5.0|This is the best of the McCartney catalogue in quite some time. I will be playing this quite frequently for years to come. Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is not like those releases you give a 4+ star rating only to, just a few weeks later,leave it up in the shelf collecting dust and never to be listened to, again, within five years.    Flaming Pie? Good. Driving Rain? Also good. Flowers in the Dirt? Listened to frequently for about two years. In all honesty, though, the more contemporary releases have not been keeping my attention for the last three years like the all-time greats Band on the Run or Venus and Mars. The previously mentioned releases are good, but do not measure up to the standard of McCartney's early-to-mid-70's work.    Chaos and Creation, I think, is a return to basics with a contemporary sound, one that is more vital for McCartney and his artistry than just drawing inspiration and reinterpretations of works from generations ago.     The best of the tracks from this release are awesome. Friends to Go is a perfect tribute to the style of his dearly departed friend and former Fab Four bandmate, George Harrison. How Kind of You is a dark tune mixing in bass guitar, piano, electric guitar, and drums in such a way that it signals an approach that Oasis could have taken to maintain its appeal to American audiences without trying to perpetually sound like Neil Young meets the Beatles.    All in all, if Top 40 radio had appreciation for songs as they did, years ago, I would say that McCartney would have had at least 4 singles released from this album. A Fine Line, How Kind of You, Too Much Rain, and At the Mercy have a sound that really deserves to be played over the airwaves. But at the moment, I will be using my CD/MP3 player more frequently to listen to, of all things, good music.    By comparison, so much else is merely rubbish for the trash bin.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|I have seen more movies than most people, but I never got around to watching the warriors until this directors edition was released.  Thats right, I've never seen the original version.  But I have to say going into this one that I had no idea what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised.  The simple story is pretty tight, and the cinematography is fantastic.  Here's the thing that surprises me the most though, one of my favorite aspects of the movie was the comic story boards, and I come to find out they were not in the original movie.  And to top that off appearently the die-hards are bothered by this.  From a new perspective I have to say, c'mon people don't you know how awsome that is.  I understand this is probably as bad as Star Wars 97' to some, but I have to say that I don't think I would have enjoyed the movie as much without the comic touch.  <br />  <br /> On another topic, I'm sick of gangster trailers and special features on new editions like scarface and this film.  It's a pretty obvious sell out when a company supports thuggary in order to boost sales.  Especially when most of these movies were originally made to shame gang violence, not to exploit it.
B000B9EY2U|2.0|Depeche have been my favorite band since my sister got a copy of \\"Some Great Reward\\" from a German pen-pal and since then I have devoured everything they've done, particularly enjoying their experimentation, and of course, Martin's awesome, thought-provoking song writing.  My favorites are Violator and Music For the Masses, but I honestly did not think they would ever do an album I didn't love (although I can say that \\"What's Your Name?\\" and \\"The Dead of Night\\" are my least liked songs of theirs).  In fact, I downloaded \\"Precious\\"  off iTunes even though I knew it wasn't different from the forthcoming album version. <br /> <br />Well....they finally lost me.  Half of this album is so dismal, so depressing that they seemed to have earned the title \\"depressed mode\\" that used to make me so mad.  \\"Precious\\" is the only ray of light on this set, otherwise it is quite painful to listen to.  \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" and \\"Suffer Well\\" are also good tracks, but the concluding track \\"The Darkest Star\\" leaves you with a feeling of hopelessness that just isn't healthy-in fact, it should be the title of this album!  Lyrically, I would say this is Depeche Mode's career low (except maybe those 2 least liked songs I mentioned before). <br /> <br />Also disappointing is the drop from introspective religious thinking/questioning/soulsearching into the outright blasphemy and ignorance of \\"John The Relevator\\" which was a huge letdown for me. <br /> <br />All in all, a fan of Depeche Mode already has this cd or cd/dvd, so this review is probably more helpful for the more casual fan.  To them I say: download \\"Precious\\" off iTunes, make yourself a \\"best of\\" cd, and move on.  If you really want to buy a Depeche Mode album on cd, here's my suggestion for order of importance: <br /> <br />(1) Violator (2) Music For The Masses (3) Black Celebration (4) Some Great Reward (5) Exciter (6) Ultra (7) Construction Time Again (8) Songs Of Faith & Devotion live...

B000AU9UYM|5.0|When the brilliant writer Bob Kane first created the Dark Knight of Gothom City in the 1930s, I'm sure one of his after thoughts was to picture his Dark Avenger in a live action movie. The dream has become fact in \\"Batman, the beginning.\\" After viewing it, my first impression is, WOW! The film is a great combination of humanistic philosophy, explosive action, menacing criminals, and an excellent script with talented actors. Crafted in the mind of originator Bob Kane, his Capped Crusader rises from the panels of DC Comics and explodes onto the big screen with all the force of a true classic. As Par for the course, director Christopher Nolan has conscripted the superb performing talents of Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, and Michael Caine as Alfred. All in all, I encourage all viewers to prepare themselves for a action crammed film of legendary characters,explosive scenes and cinematic history

B00005JNNZ|5.0|We all love movies about underdog teams that come from behind because they (1) learn the importance of teamwork, (2) learn the importance of discipline and of respect for themselves and each other, (3) are galvanized by an inspiring leader, or, even better, (4) all of the above.<br /><br />This movie, based on a true story, takes it a step further. Coach Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson), a star athlete himself in an inner-city California high school returns to coach the team. He insists that each member of the team sign a contract that includes wearing jacket and tie on game days, attending all classes and sitting in the front row in each one, and maintaining a higher grade point average than the minimum required for participation in sports. He wanted more for the young men than a winning season. Coach Carter wanted them to have a winning life, and that means that they had to have grades that would get them into college. In his view, student athletes were students first, athletes second.<br /><br />This seems simple and straightforward enough unless you are a sports fan. Or unless you are the kind of person who calls himself a \\"realist\\" and thinks these kids are not worth trying to save. Their principal falls into that category. She figures that they are not going to graduate anyway, so the best she can do is give them one great experience they can hold onto for the rest of their lives. But Coach Carter wants more. And he wants them to want more.<br /><br />He brings them together as a team, turning them from playas into players.<br /><br />Many of the team members are struggling with other pressures, from a pregnant girlfriend (played by pop star Ashanti) to the money and excitement of street crime. Carter shows them that the biggest obstacle is their own fear of trying for more than they have. \\"Starting today, you will act like winners, play like winners, and, most of all, you will be winners.\\"<br /><br />Some of the players drop out. They have no interest in school or rules. But some stay in, and the team begins to win. In most movies, there would be one setback as they lose to their cross-town rivals (the kids from the snooty school), and then they would pull themselves together for a rousing defeat of that same team for the state championship. But this movie is different.<br /><br />On January 4, 1999, the players arrived at the gym to find it padlocked. Carter discovered that they were not living up to their contracts. While a few were attending class and meeting or exceeding the required grade point average, most were not. And Carter would not let them play until all of them were caught up with their schoolwork and made good on all of their promises.<br /><br />The response by the school and the parents was outrage. Carter was threatened and a brick was thrown through his store window. It became a national news story and the focus of debate.<br /><br />For Carter, this was not about a winning season. It was about a winning life. He wanted his team to qualify for college scholarships. And he wanted them to learn discipline, teamwork, and self-respect.<br /><br />Jackson is terrific, as always, and his talent to mesmerize an audience makes him a great choice to play a coach who can give hope to people who gave up a long time ago. Just the way he says, \\"Sir,\\" insisting and inspiring his team to call him \\"Sir\\" as well, tells you everything about his character and his relationship to the players. The young cast members are more sure of themselves shooting hoops than they are showing emotion, but Jackson holds the screen so well that he gives them extra focus and presence.<br /><br />Families who enjoy this film will also enjoy other movies about inspirational teachers, from To Sir with Love and Up the Down Staircase to Hoosiers, Lean on Me and Stand and Deliver, and other movies about high school sports teams like Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights. And every family should watch the brilliant documentary, Hoop Dreams,the story of two high school students from the poorest neighborhood whose skill on the basketball court leads to new opportunities and tough choices.entary, Hoop Dreams, the story of two high school students from the poorest neighborhood whose skill on the basketball court leads to new opportunities and tough choices.

If you have no interest in the truth, and reality of current world affairs, and only hope to justify your own bitter prejudices & Islamophobia, then by all means, this IS the book for you. <br /> <br />Instead though, I recommend the movie, \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", which is somewhat more accurate than the drivel offered in this trashy little book.

1573301183|5.0|Buy this DVD - you will not be disappointed. I watched this session when it was first aired on MTV back in the day; of course it was edited for content and to fit within the hour time frame, so you really didn't get the whole experience. All of the songs (including the Sludge Factory take 1, which is actually pretty funny) are included here - not even the CD has EVERYthing - so it gives the listener/viewer the full experience. Definitely worth the money for a rare glimpse at a true one-of-a-kind band that really carved their own niche from the Seattle scene in the 90's.  <br />If I had my way I would have liked to see more extra stuff on the disc like interviews with Alice members or other bands. Would have been cool, but not necessary to enjoy the hell out of this show.

0446310786|3.0|To Kill a Mockingbird <br />by Harper Lee <br /> <br />Jean Louise Finch is a feisty little girl, growing up in Maycomb County, Alabama. Jean Louise, or \\"Scout\\" as everyone else calls her, has a mind of her own and is a tomboy that prefers overalls over dresses. Her older brother Jem is her best friend, along with Dill, a kid who visits the neighborhood every summer. These three kids spend their time questioning The Radley House. The run down house stands just a few doors down away from the Finch Household. Who knows what secrets are behind those closed doors? All they know about this mysterious house is that Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley hasn't been seen since before they could remember. During the time of the Great Depression, Scout faces the racism that comes with living in an African American community and it's hard effects that is has on her home. <br />          One day, Scout and Jem's father, Atticus, who is a lawyer, is assigned to defend an African American. Tom Robinson is being charged for supposedly raping a young white woman. After that, nothing seems to be the same. The two siblings are ridiculed at school, and must face the town's people who think that what their father is doing is wrong. Young adult readers may or may not enjoy this classic novel. It has a huge racial discrimination, but a great theme that is tied in with the title. Young adults everywhere should give To Kill a Mockingbird a try. <br />

B000B2YQX4|4.0|**Playing the Angle by Depeche Mode**  <br /> <br />I think the album is GOOD based on the bars I set for it after the dissapointment with Exciter and both Daves and Martins recent solo albubms. Its definatly much better than EXCITER ,  but I am not sure if its better than ULTRA as overall.  I feel that there is still something missing (the sound scapes are weak and too experimental souding).   Ofcourse what its really missing is their sound architect \\"Alan Wilder\\".  The vocals are very good for both Dave and Martin. After hearing both of their solo albums, I thought that they had lost it..especially Martin, but he can still hit his high and low pitches very well.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are good for the most part thanks to Martin, although not as strong as some of his previous efforts.... I can easily tell which songs were written by Dave (Cliche sounding lyrics that go from one place to another) and at the end...you dont know what he is talking about. His tracks were good otherwise and I like how Martin does backing vocals on many of the tracks....it reminds me of the old DM.  <br /> <br />I think Ben Hiller's (producer) influence was strong in the sense that the music is very experimental sounding, yet not too smoothing as compared to their other albums...kinda has that modern Bjork / Aphex Twin feel to it at times. What I dont like much is that nail scrathy harsh noise they keep introducing to their tracks like on the last album Exciter for the song \\"the dead of night\\" (mainly on the first track)....its cool at times but overall it does not have a appeal to the masses. The most standout track is \\"precious\\" that sounds different than all the other songs in the album and has the mainstream appeal needed to make it a good single. I wish they had more songs with that smooth delivery and less of the experimental touch.  <br /> <br />Overall the music is kinda weak but not bad. If only Alan Wilder was behind it, this album had potential of being another hit like Black Celebration/Music for the Masses. I think the drums on \\"John the Revelator\\" are a bid cheezy. I wish the music for \\"Lilian\\" was dumped over the vocals on \\"John the Revelator\\" cause the music is actually good, but Daves vocal delivery style on \\"Lilian\\" is not excatly my style.  <br /> <br />I think the two Martin Gore performed tracks (Macro & Damaged people) are good, but weaker than the ones from he performed on Ultra. He shows his amazing vocals and that is good enough for me....although it leaves me wanting more.  <br /> <br />Overall...I'll give this album an 8/10 cause its much better than it could have been. I justg couldnt handle another Exciter and this is better.  If only Alan Wilder would join the team and get them back to where they should be. <br />
0345423496|4.0|3001: the Final Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke is a science-fiction novel that is ultimately compelling.  The story, unlike some science-fiction novels, is not too strange or too creepy to get into or understand.  The main reason that 3001 does not seem too strange or unrealistic is because it takes place in the future.  When playing with the future, the author can make anything sound as if it could be a real thing and suddenly nothing is out of the range of \\"normalness\\" even for a fiction novel.  Clarke's style is very simple, (the reading level is probably Junior High) but it is filled with some symbolism, many allusions, and a few too many clichs.  While Clark's style is simple, it does not take anything away from the story.  In fact, I believe that it assists the author in his descriptions.  Describing the human race one thousand years from now would seem like such a hard thing to do, but Clarke truly possesses the mark of a great writer and possibly the greatest science fiction wring of his time. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is not the author's descriptions or ideas of how things will be in one thousand years, but it is how Clarke forces the reader into thought.  The fact that this Poole comes from 1000 years before when he now lives begins a thought-provoking discovery.  It is great that Clarke is showing the future through the eyes of a twenty-first century man, someone who the reader can relate to because of the time-connection.  As the reader sees it through Poole's eye, the reader can feel as thought they were Poole.  The specific question raised in the book is how it would be to have someone who lived in the 1000s to suddenly appear in the 2000s.  Think of all the changes humans have gone through it just the last 100 years.  Considering that, now how will our world look in the year 3000.  Will people be: brighter or dumber, taller or shorter, more dependent or less dependent on technology?  Clarke does a good job of answeringquestions like that and making his prophecy of one thousand years from now seem at least somewhat correct in its logic and technological theories.  The reader is drawn to consider all of mankind and how we have grown in search for God, education and brainpower, and how we will continue (or not continue to grow).  Civilization for humans can be seen as a large exponential function.  At the beginning of man it took quite a while for our first ancestors to greatly contribute to the rest of mankind.  As time went on more and more each civilization came up with more and more inventions to help the world.  Yet in just the last 100 years, the advances we have made have been \\"astronomical\\" toward every person's life and items.   <br />  <br />Though the story was excellent, I believe that the true masterpiece of this work is in how it forced you to think philosophically and historically about what we know and believe to be true.  I do recommend this book to people of all ages (specifically young boys or girls) and I hope that anyone who reads this story will not simply read it for it's plot, but mostly for the intellectual thought-process that it starts. <br />
B0002TKFGS|3.0|I ordered this based on the fact that all of the songs (except the three from the 1980's) were remixed from the original session tapes.  This was fantastic news for me, as I have loved these tunes since the day I was born, but (like every other music buyer) have only been handed the same limp mixes from day one, in various degrees of tape hiss. <br /> <br />So, it came today, and I popped it in. <br /> <br />\\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\" comes on.  WOW!  There is a bass line to this song!!!  The fidelity is incredible!  Hmmm...that instrument is louder than originally....but hey, I like it! <br /> <br />\\"Rocky Mountain High\\" comes on.  Wow!  The fullness is great....the guitars have life to them......They even fixed that vocal glitch on the \\"He Climbed Cathedral Mountains\\" line.  This is great---wait a minute!  What did he say?  That line is different!  Hold On!  Some of this is an alternate vocal track! <br /> <br />\\"Back Home Again\\" comes on.  What the hell???  Why is there a drum kit way up in the mix on this?  Where is the subtlety of the original mix?  This is absurd. <br /> <br />So goes the whole CD....some differences are mild-to-non-exsistant, and some just change the particular song into something different than we remember. <br /> <br />There is a bonus disc that comes with this CD which contains \\"Calypso\\" and \\"Annie's Song\\" in acoustic remixes (read: the actual master recordings with almost everything dropped except the guitars and vocals), an early lesser-quality demo-take of \\"Leavin' On A Jet Plane\\", and two other unreleased tunes.  The second disc is not essential by any stretch. <br /> <br />So, basically, RCA/BMG had a good chance to finally make these somgs come alive after years of subjecting us to the same worn-out, hiss-filled 1970's mixes, but instead, we get tracks which can be justifyibly called \\"alternate versions\\". <br /> <br />Instead of a remixed greatest hits, we get something more closely resembeling The Beatles \\"Anthology\\" series. <br/> <br />Good to buy for the completeist, but the casual fan should stick to the original 3 volumes of JD's Greatest Hits.
1878424319|5.0|A great, easy read.  This book helped me be aware of some basic things in life that we often take for granted, especially the Agreement: Don't make assumptions.  We all do this but I have really gained some insight from this and feel I am a more open individual because of it.  Buy it!  It's simple, easy to understand and I find myself referring back to it every now and then instead of just letting it collect dust on the bookshelf.

B0008G2IRO|4.0|I didn't realize that so many people were anticipating Gorillaz's second full-length album. It's not to say they aren't good, but I guess I didn't notice what a strong cult fanbase they have. At any rate, I never got around to hearing their self-titled album, but I can't say I'm not impressed by Demon Days.<br /><br />Though it's very hard to tell who's even in this group (the last time I checked, the main focus was Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Dan the Automator, but I heard Dan left), there are still quality songs on here. The group gets a lot of help from underground stars like Roots Manuva (\\"All Alone\\") and MF Doom (\\"November Has Come\\"), proving outstanding results.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure why Dennis Hopper is on this album, but his narrative on \\"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\\" does work well with the production. And we all know how great \\"Feel Good Inc\\" is; the only problem there is -- and I tried very hard to overlook this -- okay, it's 2005, so you really shouldn't be saying \\"don't stop; get it, get it\\" any more. Oh well, that doesn't take away from the greatness of the song. But as good as that song is, you just can't front on the dope beat on \\"Dare\\".<br /><br />If you haven't realized yet, Gorillaz' music isn't the most accessible, but if you could get into all their other stuff (not to mention the group members' work prior to this; remember, Chris and Tina were in Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club), then you should truly enjoy Demon Days. So pick it up and experience a great album from the coolest group around.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

0743454537|5.0|After reading this novel, the reader finds themselves in a variety of emotions. My Sister's Keeper stirs up questions of morality, and why things are the way they are, a book that questions life itself.   <br />  <br /> In the beginning, the reader meets Kate, only two, who has acute promyelocytic leukemia. In other words, she has cancer. When her parents find out they have a series of decisions to make to prolong their daughters life. Their very first decision sparks the story. What is the first move? Choosing the genetics of their next daughter, Anna, just so she can be Kate's donor. For all of Anna's life she must rush to the hospital whenever Kate does, not only as a sister, but for all main purposes, a donor. As Anna begins to question the life she is living, this life of no choice, this life that doesn't belong to her, she has the chance to make a decision of her own. <br /> <br /> Is Anna's decision so wrong? Does she have this kind of right? It is her body after all. True? At the same time, what will her family's reaction be? Have their decisions been so moral? Answer these questions after reading this amazing novel. Question life and question reality. A truly intriguing book challenges the reader to do so. What a rare find.  <br />
B00007KWHN|5.0|Yes's third album was the full development of the signature Yes sound, and solidly established Yes as being a progressive rock group as well as establishing the definition of progressive rock. This album contained the longest compositions from Yes on any of their first three albums, and allowed Yes to fully exploit musical themes.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\", a 9:40 composition exceeded in length rarely in rock music to this point (exceeded by King Crimson and Iron Butterfly and approached by The Moody Blues). There is a strong jazz influence in this song that benefited from the contributions of all the talented members of the group. Occasionally some of the riffs sound a bit dated, but the dated portions are balanced by some very experimental music that can be heard in numerous later works by other artists.<br /><br />\\"The Clap\\" acoustically follows. An unusual piece for Yes given that they are known for their lush and complex electricly driven music. Chet Atkins has been given as an influence for this song. Perhaps. The strong acoustic performance is difficult to classify, which by definition makes it somewhat progressive. Well played guitar.<br /><br />Then comes the epic \\"Starship Troopers\\", which was inspired by Robert A. Heinlein's novel of the same name (which has only moderate similarity to the movie of the same name). I am a great fan of Robert A. Heinlein, but in this case I think the vision of the music has exceeded the vision of the book. The instruments, including the relatively new Moog synthesizer, handle all of the orchestration, creating a more electronic and soaring symphonic work than those of The Moody Blues, who were previously known for this type of music. This song was very innovative in its transitions and creation of multiple parts, and set the stage for future progressive groups. A great piece.<br /><br />\\"I've Seen All Good People\\" starts with \\"Your Move\\", which evokes imagery of a chess game. A cautionary song about relationships and how people behave toward each other. This song is less epic than \\"Starship Troopers\\", but contains catchy hooks and allows sufficient time to explore the musical concept. The ending of the second part of this piece, \\"All Good People\\", is gorgeous and wonderful, and would be perfectly played with a pipe organ, though the building would be shaking.<br /><br />\\"A Venture\\" is a fairly basic and simple song by Yes standards. This song is closer to the previous Yes albums than the other songs on this album. Clearly a Yes composition, but the least of the songs on this album.<br /><br />\\"Perpetual Change\\" contains elements of the symphonic rock played on some of the earlier tracks, but relies more on the vocals and the lyrics to define the song. A wonderful addition, this song establishes that the type of music Yes was creating could be progressive in more than one way, expansive instrumentally complex symphonic rock, or vocally complex music with poetic evocative lyrics sewn together by an innovative bridge.<br /><br />Progressive music was one of the numerous types of music to evolve from rock out of the incredibly creative period from 1966 to 1975. There were clear indications that something was happening with groups like The Moody Blues and King Crimson and their creations of the late 60s and early 70s. Yes did more than just improve upon what these groups did, they nailed the definition, they allowed us to look back and see that progressive music had been around since 1967, but it took an album like \\"The Yes Album\\" to make us realize what had happened even though we were looking for it.autionary song about relationships and how people behave toward each other.

0689865384|5.0|The book Uglies, by Scott Westerfeld was a terrific grab. The novel had exciting tributes and very thought holding adventures that made you want to read more and more. The tween in the story, Tally Youngblood, gave a sense of a home town friend. She had a smart personality and was always thinking up ways to entertain herself. The story itself hooks in the reader mainly in the second chapter when the plot starts to unravel a little more and adds a sense of resolution to Tally's oncoming problem. Tally knows about the Rusties, but she doesn't know if she dare try to hover board her way there. What would happen if she was lost, or worse hated what was there, her new home? Being pretty seems so simple when you've been such an ugly... but does it really have the appeal that you see? Oddness is key in this journey of words. Many new and mind challenging actions turn about in the middle of the jam packed story line. A promise is a promise and Tally intends to keep the two as long as she can possibly hold onto her sanity. Like normal young adults, embarrassment and drama comes into play but no one can bring the infamous and braving Tally to do anything her soul won't possibly accept. Further more, loyalty is an engraving moral in this novel that brings numerous amounts of loose ends together. Torn between two friends and whose world keeps her, has your imagination bouncing. Enchanting thoughts fill Tally's head about the special events that are on arrival, but the heart wrenching facts she has so suddenly learned will make you yearn to read on and on until every last sentence has stopped you in your tracks.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|This is definately the best work from Depeche Mode since Violator. SOFAD was great but this is better. While each DM album has a certain theme to it, this one seems to be more industrial and more upbeat then the last 2 cd's. Being a huge DM fan, I did like Ultra, but I only liked about half of Exciter, so this is up there with Music for the Masses, or Black Celebration, let's not get too excited just yet however because nothing will ever touch Violator, unfortunately.  <br />Here is a brief of what I think of the songs: <br /> <br />A Pain That I'm Used To   9/10   Great song, basslines reminds me a little bit of Policy of Truth once you get past the opening guitar. A little cross between that and Barrel of a Gun. Sounds also like a show opener? <br /> <br />John The Revelator  8/10  Took a while to grow on me, but a good song, definately different from anything I've heard before, upbeat, and stomping. Could be something from SOFAD only more modern, maybe could be thought of as some type of electonic reggae? <br /> <br />Suffer Well  10/10  This is one of the best DM songs ever, a little Violator, New Order-ish guitar throughout this song with great lyrics. This is your standard fan favorite along side a few others on this cd. It's upbeat and will be a DM classic years from now. Love it. <br /> <br />Sinner In Me  10/10  A Little bit of NIN, or even reminds me a little of  \\"Mercy in You\\" A trip-hop, Massive Attack beat behind great haunting DM synths and good lyrics to boot. Even a guitar solo, if you call it that. Organized DM noises! <br /> <br />Precious 10/10  Maybe the 2nd best song I ever heard from DM. First being \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" This is an instant DM classic and such a good, perfect flowing song. Good lyrics, good vocals, good piano-synth lines. A top 40 hit?  maybe, it should be. <br /> <br />Macro 6/10  Not all bad, but usually skip it. Martin is lead on this one and the lyrics are kinda weird, but the song does get better as it continues. Still betterthen \\"Comatose\\" but kinda reminds me of that one a little bit. <br /> <br />I Want It All  10/10  Another great song. Reminds me a little of Ultra, because it is a slow one, but good lyrics, and haunting music make it a modern day Waiting for the Night?  or Clean, maybe just good on it's own without comparison. <br /> <br />Nothing's Impossible  10/10  This is music for the masses 2005. Can't get enough of this song with it's dark sounding verses, and sarcastic chorus over MFTM sounds. The synth lines again remind me of MFTM, or even Black Celebration. <br /> <br />Introspectre  5/10  Not even considered really. For the most part, it's a minute and a half of ambient sounds. Will be the intro music for the tour - I'm sure. <br /> <br />Damaged People 6/10  Not my favorite, Martin sings, it's kinda creepy, weird. The  music is very DM but I'm just not a huge fan of this one. Hopefully we'll hear \\"I Want You Now,\\" \\"Home,\\" \\"The Bottom Line\\" or \\"Question of Lust\\" as the Martin lead when they play live. <br /> <br />Lillian  9/10  Good song, classic sounding DM with good lyrics but different. Dave's voice is very industrial sounding. Fast paced, upbeat, and doesn't really remind me of anything from them in the past, but if you heard it, you would still know it's DM. Synth-pop, industrial voice, with a little guitar over the top. <br /> <br />Darkest Star  9/10  This is haunting, different, darker then most anything I've heard from DM in years. Slow but driving. It took a while to grow on me, but now this 6+ minute song is interesting, addictive and never skipped. Creepy and Dark, and just in time for Halloween. <br /> <br />B-side of Precious  \\"Free\\"  9/10  Awesome song. Reminds me of Sea of Sin, or Happiest Girl as far as B-sides go. Worth picking up the cd-single just for this song. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great cd, and will stay in my cd player for a while. I can't wait to see them do some of these songs live along side the classics. Return to form for sure after a dissappointing effort called Exciter.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah thank you, thank you, thank you. This is the Mariah that I wanted to hear. I was sick and tired of hearing you whining, dressing like a slut and squashing your potential of a beautiful voice which you so beautifully displayed on your first 3 albums before you broke up with your grandfather (ooops, I meant husband, hehehe ;) <br /> <br />HOWEVER, all that has changed with this one. I heard \\"Its Like That\\" on the radio and kept wondering who this was. It kind of sounded like someone I knew, but couldn't think of who it was. Lo and behold, I found out that it was Mariah Carey and was shocked. It does not sound like her at all. Then I heard \\"We Belong Together\\" and thought, this is the Mariah Carey that I remember. The one that I used to listen to before she divorced her husband and got tainted. (Remember Vision of Love? that was the one that put her on and introduced her to the world) <br />Mariah Carey is back with a vengeance on this one though. She has returned to her roots and has still managed to appeal to a mainstream audience and her diehard fans. The guest appearances are good, but not enough to where you can't remember whose album it is. I hate listening to cd's where the main artist is featured on their own album. The production is very good on this, the songs flow together without too much of a problem.  <br />I'm glad to say that I purchased this one, after Honey, she fell off to me. I have been waiting for Mariah to finally get back to her real voice, stop trying to dress like shes back in the 9th grade and just focus on singing. This whole CD is really well put together...I am glad that she did this. One of the best ones of 2005 in my opinion, if not, then someone needs to prove it. Thank you Mariah for going back to what made you popular in the first place: your voice, not your body.  <br />
B0002DB52M|5.0|This movie has been widely misunderstood.  It is not anti-American.  It is not a meditation on the baseness of humans.  What it is, is a meditation on how power corrupts us -- all of us.  It corrupted the peaceful little town.  It ultimately corrupted Grace.  Is it pessimistic, or realistic?  What are the implications for how we should live in society?  What are the implications for how countries, whether they be the USA, China, Rwanda, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, operate?  It gets you thinking.
B00005YU1O|4.0|A thought inspiring, artful, highly entertaining, and in short an amazing film.  The movies deep, philosophical underpinnings  are the highlights of the movie.  Not Recommended for: People with ADD, or people who who enjoy movies with a cheap thrill.  This movie will help clarify your worldview and question the world around you.

B000002A3T|5.0|If \\"The Final Cut\\" made you want to commit a suicide, \\"The Division Bell\\" will make you enjoy every second of your life, The best guitar works of Gilmour are here, a very posative album, i find it better than \\"Wish You Were Here\\".
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Cher was so cool!  I went to the concert when she was at the Pyrmaid here in Memphis and she rocked.  I never screamed so loud for someone.  She was everything good and some.  And it's sad that this is her last stance on a music stage.  But as long as good thngs come to a end you can respect what she has given to the music industry for 40 years.  Nothing else better then divas like Cher to bring so much love and joy out of this.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|To be honest when I first read that Depeche Mode was going to release yet another album, I thought that it could not get any worse than \\"Exciter.\\" While \\"Exciter\\" had the top fourty hit \\"Dream On\\", it lacked the darkness,the passion,and the danceabilty that \\"Violator,\\" \\"Songs of Faith,\\" and \\"Music of the Masses\\" had. However, \\"Exciter\\" was not as bad as \\"Speak and Spell.\\" I finally saw the video for \\"Precious\\", and I stood up and cheered. They got it right! Holy black leather Batman! They got it right! They got rid of \\"New Coke\\" and stuck with \\"Coca- Cola Classic.\\" <br /> <br />This album is one of their most personal albums, and I must say that the music is a lot more sophisticated and unified. If you like true industrial dance,and darkwave music Depeche Mode still wears the crown. Dance in your bedroom, go crazy and above all \\"Enjoy the Silence.\\" BTW: While concerts are very expensive  this group is worth the money. Even seeing them once is an experience that you can share with your children when they are older. And yes, if Martin wears the angel outfit like he did for the \\"Exciter\\" tour, you are free to laugh. <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I've loved Avril ever since the day she came out.  She has such a craft for good music.  Tracks like \\"Nobody's Home\\", \\"My Happy Ending\\", \\"Slipped Away\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and more.  Her voice reminds me of Anais Morisette.  I just love you Avril keep doing your thing.
B000002LAB|5.0|In 1985, Miles Davis' thirty year association with Columbia Records came to an end and the jazz legend, who managed to reinvent jazz a dozen times over managed to reinvent the price value of jazz recording contracts when he signed with Warner Brothers.  What Davis unfortunately didn't seem to do was read past the bottom line and his royalties for songwriting would lie with Warner Brothers, not with him.  As a result, Davis refused to compose anything on his own and instead brought his former bass player Marcus Miller to compose for him.  Miller wrote compositions for Davis and set up a framework in which the trumpeter could solo.  The first album resulting from this collaboration, \\"Tutu\\", proves to be one of the great records of Davis' career, and like \\"Sketches of Spain\\" before it, provides a powerful launching pad for Davis and coaxes out of him one of his best performances. <br /> <br />Musically, the album is guaranteed to alienate Davis fans everywhere-- while he'd abandoned acoustic instruments as the only way to go in the '60s, this album was an embracing of synthesizers, drum machines, and electric instruments, even moreso than his previous records were.  Miller performed all the electric and acoustic instruments (including bass guitar, electric guitar, at least some live drums, soprano sax, bass clarinet and synthesizers) with additional contributions in synth programming from Ron Miles and Adam Holzman and one track (\\"Backyard Ritual\\") where George Duke assumes the framing role.  The album does sound (particularly in the drum tracks) a bit dated, but this in no way gets in the way of enjoying the album anymore than acoustic basses get in the way of enjoying Davis' '50s work-- in fact, it all adds to the ambience.  Most importantly is that Davis, who sometimes seemed a bit unengaged with his own music on his later recordings, is full of fire and passion-- blows powerfully in a number of different moods, be it passion and fir (\\"Tutu\\"), a deep romanticism andyearning (\\"Portia\\"), funky explosiveness (\\"Splatch\\") or bouncey ecstacy (\\"Perfect Way\\"). <br /> <br />For the purists who claim it's not jazz if it has electric instruments, programmed beats, or synthesizers-- skip this, you'll find nothing to like and nothing I say will convince you otherwise, even though this album is one of the best of its form.  For those who question bringing in Miller to frame Davis and would make the statement this is a Marcus Miller record thinly veiled as a Miles Davis album-- remember that Gil Evans set up the same kind of framings for Davis, and no one views \\"Miles Ahead\\" or \\"Sketches of Spain\\" (or for that matter \\"The Birth of the Cool\\" where Davis only cowrote one piece) as anything other than a Miles Davis album.  The fact is, this album is one of the best of its generation, and time and again, Davis proved he was capable of shaking the jazz world apart.  And I suspect it's no coincidence that in his absence, a regressionist viewpoint has taken hold in commercial jazz.  \\"Tutu\\" is a relic of a time when artists were not afraid to try something new.  Highly recommended.

B000A0GP0Y|5.0|This movie made me laugh, which is good because I was starting to worry about Mr. Sandler. It's great to see he returned to \\"funny\\" comedy even if it is a remake. Stick to what ya know Adam and stop with the cerebral comedy.

B00006DEFA|5.0|What stands out is that instead of giving us an account of Mozart from the point of historical reference we are shown a Mozart from the interpretations of his archrival Salieri, a composer who is obsessed with his own creative failure but as a man of great reputation, while facing off against Mozart's creative accomplishments but who Salieri considers an absolute mule of a man, possibly insane. Salieri's obsession with these contradictions precedes a developing madness. The whole is film is based on this great premise. That is all it is about! The costume design is highly regarded as some of the best committed to celluloid, including the hairdos.
B0000D96NW|4.0|Yes believe it or not gang this is NOT burn my eyes, even though there are some small simularities here, the only two orginal members are Flynn and Deuce. A different drummer(McClain) and guitar player (Demnell) will bring a whole new feel to the band as opposed to just say a bass player. Burn my Eye's was classic as it was original, and where people get the idea that they sound like pantera is beyond me. I remember even in 1994 when the album debuted that people were calling it Metalcore, i thought what in gods name does that mean? Bascially Nothing. Metal is Metal is Metal. So all these comparisons are ludicrous, its not BME and why should it have to be, its new, its fresh and its today even though it does have old school elements. BME was original and a real breakthrough for the band, once you've been \\"heard\\" so to speak, the albums after probably arent going to be anything new, just an addition to the prior album or an expansion. I do really enjoy this album but i hope the next one has more solo's from the boys, and less groovin' tunes, if everysong were like Imperium, and In The Presence Of My Enemies i think they will realy make more of a break though than with this album. But as it stands this definately was the best album of 2003 in my opinion. This year belongs to \\"Nevermore\\" i must say, gonna be tuff to beat them. But Machine Head are in a whole different genre, and hopefully they won't fall bag on any new trendy band wagon's as in the past. As much as i love this band  something tells me that this is the last horrah for them, and anything that follows this album up will probably be a farewell album. Reason being, i don't think Phil's heart is into it and he doesnt know how to deal with all the success after being out of the loop for so long, in the recent DVD he seems out of place. When he's on stage he plays well but in the seens off stage he seems annoyed and much rather like he would be at home. I hope i'm wrong and Machine Head comes back triumphant,but as musicians come and go because of the corrupt music industry, that is hard to say with any absolute certainty. Listen to this album and don't look back, just hope for the future of MH.Later
B000929AJQ|4.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I just saw nine inch nails live a week ago, and they were amazing. The energy, the sound-quality, the setlist; it all came together very, very well. Now, having said that, I think that the songs off of With Teeth, the album they're currently touring off of, work EXTREMELY well in a live setting alongside the rest of their material. To dismiss this album as a St. Anger-type dropping-of-the-ball is really a careless thing to do, as there are several songs on here that are as good as anything nine inch nails have ever released. \\"The Hand That Feeds,\\" the lead-off single, is three and a half minutes of catchy riff-rock that is the perfect catalyst to get people into the album, while tracks like \\"You Know What You Are\\" and \\"Getting Smaller\\" tweak the same nerve that Broken played so well over a decade ago. But the stand-out track, clearly, is \\"Right Where it Belongs,\\" a piano ballad from the other side of a repressive, repetitive lifestyle. \\"See the animal in the cage that you've built/Are you sure which side you're on?\\" echoes \\"Hurt\\" in more ways than one. Take a listen to the album and decide for yourself if it's up to par with everything else. I think you'll find yourself glad that you made the purchase.
B00006B1HH|1.0|Okay, here's the deal... I was almost a teenager when this film came out, and I had never seen a movie before or since that was SO over hyped and way WAY overplayed as this Film.  But you got to look at it like this: It came out in '78, and at that time, America was in love with the 1950's. Take for example, &#34;Happy Days&#34; and &#34;Laverne and Shirley&#34;.  But just like now, people got into the current &#34;IT&#34; film, so of course Grease became &#34;The word&#34;. But come on, I thought those stupid Doo-Wopp songs were really annoying then, and I sure don't like them any better now!  I didn't grow up in the 50's, but I kinda get the feeling that it was nothing like what they portrayed it to be in this movie.  Also, I think it's a pretty bad message to show that you have to go from being a good, poodle skirt-wearing girl, to being a gum-chewin', cigarette-smokin' bimbo, to get the leading man.  And please don't tell me, &#34;Oh, chill out, it's just a movie&#34;; I don't think Ossie and Harriette would have been too keen on that. ;)
B000002GFC|2.0|<br />Ive yet to find any live Cream recordings that are any where near as good as Crossroads and Spoonful on Wheels of Fire. All the other stuff lacks the moral power of experiencing new space. Does anyone out there know of any other recordings that are on the same page ? Regards John Nobbs
0380789035|3.0|Very original, with occasional high points: spooky, funny, clever..  but ultimately it left too many plot points/hints/clues unresolved for my taste.  I'm as big a fan of Things Left Unexplained as anybody, but when I finished I found that rather than being awed by the mystery of it all, I was instead just a bit confused.  Generally enjoyable though, and I still like the \\"Ancient Gods trying to get by in the modern world\\" idea that I first saw Gaiman use in Sandman.  If you have a good understanding of world religions/mythologies, you should get a kick out of this.
B000002LEM|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />1988 saw the release of Van Halen's eighth studio album \\"OU812.\\" It was the band's second release with lead singer Sammy Hagar. Pronounced \\"oh you ate one too,\\" the title was a response to David Lee Roth's first post-Van Halen album, \\"Eat `Em and Smile\\" (1986).<br /><br />Compared to the classic first six Van Halen albums (with lead singer David Lee Roth), the early Van Halen albums with singer Sammy Hagar are far more commercial. While Van Halen had been becoming steadily more commercial since \\"Diver Down,\\" (1982) the early Van Hagar albums are the bands most radio-friendly work. Therefore, while albums like \\"Van Halen\\" (1978) and \\"Woman and Children First\\" (1980) can be labeled \\"metal,\\" or \\"hard-rock,\\" \\"5150\\" and \\"OU812\\" can best be labeled \\"adult-contemporary\\" rock.<br /><br />Depending on whom you ask, \\"OU812\\" is either one of Van Halen's best, or worst albums. To fans that accepted Sammy Hagar, \\"OU812\\" is a tight, pop-savvy, stellar collection of songs. To those that remained loyal to Roth and classic Van Halen, however, \\"OU812\\" represents Van Halen's full dissent into commercialism.<br /><br />While I favor classic Van Halen and am a big Dave fan, I am quite fond of this album.<br /><br />Although many fans would disagree, I feel \\"OU812\\" is an improvement over \\"5150\\" (1986). When Sammy Hagar first joined Van Halen most of \\"5150\\" had already been written. \\"OU812\\" is the first album Sammy Hagar wrote and recorded with Van Halen from scratch. Also, by the time the band recorded their second collaboration, they had been playing together for a few years. Therefore, compared to \\"5150,\\"  \\"OU812\\" seems to have more of an organic feel. Also, the production and the band, overall, sound better.  On \\"OU812\\" drummer Alex Van Halen went back to playing on a real kit, as opposed to an electric one, as he had on \\"5150.\\"<br /><br />While Sammy Hagar is a great singer, on \\"5150\\" he sounds as if he were singing into soup cans. His vocal talents are more apparent on the follow-up, as he belts out the songs and his full capability is realized.<br /><br />Lastly, while \\"5150\\" is a good album, its production was off-center and the CD was bogged down with synthesizers. \\"OU812\\" is more of a bare bones recording. While many of the songs do have synthesizers, they aren't overbearing, but rather just touch up the songs like a garnish.<br /><br />Pop, commercial, radio-friendly, whatever you want to call it, it still goes without saying, of course, that Eddie's playing is phenomenal.<br /><br />\\"OU812\\" opens up strong with the anthem rocker \\"Mine All Mine.\\" The light underlining synthesizers add a nice touch. This song which concerns drug/alcohol addiction demonstrates Sammy Hagar's knack for writing meaningful lyrics that aren't pretentious.<br /><br />\\"When it's Love\\" is a good, straight-forward love song. While some old-school Van Halen fans may cringe and dismiss it as \\"corporate,\\" the song works because it is well written and sincere.<br /><br />\\"A.F.U. (All Fired Up) (Naturally Wired)\\" is an infectious, fast paced rocker that keeps up the momentum. While not really an album highlight, it works well.<br /><br />The mid-tempo, pop-savvy \\"Cabo Wabo,\\" is one of Van Hagar's finest moments. Its melodic verse and sing-along chorus make for a concert staple and fan favorite.<br /><br />\\"Source of Infection\\", with its rapid drumming and guitar intro, sounds like a return to classic Roth-era Van Halen. While the lyrics are sparse and don't make a lot of sense, this makes for a good semi-instrumental jam.<br /><br />\\"Feels So Good,\\" much like \\"When it's Love\\" will probably be off-putting to those that prefer a harder-rocking Halen. Still, this synth-led, mid-tempo number is undeniably catchy.<br /><br />The acoustic \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" is another one of the album's highlights and remains one of Halen/Hagar's best collaborations.<br /><br />The mid-tempo \\"Black and Blue\\" is a little sophomoric and shows how Hagar lacks the wit ofRoth. Still, the song is effective and it keeps up the album's momentum.<br /><br />The hard-rocking \\"Sucker in a 3 piece\\" is probably the album's most underrated song. It has an absolutely killer solo.<br /><br />The album closes with a cover of \\"A Apolitical Blues\\" (written by Lowell George). Although it may seem odd to end the album with a straight-blues rocker, which is far different stylistically than the rest of the album, it works and doesn't seem to out-of-place. It actually makes for an interesting left turn.<br /><br />\\"OU812' is not without its flaws. It's hard to hear Michael Anthony's bass. Also, the album sounds a bit thin at times. The album could do with a remastering and even a remixing.<br /><br />Almost twenty years old, \\"OU812\\" has stood up pretty well against the test-of-time. The album works as well as it does because, despite its flaws, it's a tight, strong collection of songs. There isn't really any filler, everything works. Although Van Hagar would eventually tune out the synthesizers and rock-harder with subsequent releases, \\"OU812\\" is probably Van Hagar's best written album.er in a 3 piece\\" is probably the album's most underrated song.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Movie franchises are cherished commodities in Hollywood, when a studio finds a series of films that works well with audiences they will fight tooth and nail to hold on and capitalize on that success.  Sometimes this tenacity proves to be the undoing of the specific franchise, because in the process of capitalizing the movie studio churns out installment after installment in the franchise, and often times loses sight of what made the franchise so great in the beginning, resulting in diminished box office numbers and the end of a franchise.  However, sometimes franchises work for long periods of time, now they may hit some bumps in the road, but after taking a break the franchise returns with renewed vigor and blows audiences away.  Examples of this trend would be the ever-popular `James Bond' series, the `Superman' franchise, `Star Wars', and `Batman'.  With each of those examples, time away has produced strong box office numbers, and even with changes made with the cast and directors involved the success remains.  Examples of franchises that suffered from over exposure and lack of story and craftsmanship are as follows: `A Nightmare on Elm Street', `Friday the 13th', and `Halloween' (note that all of the series' listed as eventual failures were horror franchises).  The focus of this review is on one of the franchises listed above that after having huge success with 4 films, though the final installment was the weakest and turned fans off for some time, took an 8 year absence from the big screen and returned in the summer of 2005 with huge critical and commercial success.  The franchise is `Batman', and the movie that put this franchise back on top, well technically it kick-started a whole new `Batman' franchise, was Christopher Nolan's expertly crafted origin tale, \\"Batman Begins\\". <br /> <br />Completely ignoring the previous 4 films from the original `Batman' franchise, \\"Batman Begins\\" delivers an in-depth look at the origins of the Dark Knight.  After the murderof his parents, young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) embarks on a quest to find the means to fight injustice in all forms.  This quest takes him all over the world, where he learns how to defend himself and others, become a great detective, and eventually he realizes that his time has come to return to the city that he once called home, Gotham City, and cleanse it of the evil that has corrupted it.  However, to do this he must become more than just a man, he must become a symbol.  Not just any symbol will work, it must be something that will strike fear into the hearts of men, with this realization the Batman is born.  With the aid of his trusty butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), and his business associate Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Bruce Wayne/Batman will rid Gotham City from the likes of the maniacal Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), who uses fear as his weapon, the deranged Ra's Al Ghul, and mob boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). <br /> <br />After \\"Batman & Robin\\" caused Warner Brothers' faith in the `Batman' franchise to dwindle, it's not hard to imagine the difficulty the WB had with returning to a franchise that over the course of 4 films went from flagship franchise to non-existent.  To convince the execs at the WB to greenlight another `Batman' film required the film to have a top-notch cast, a superb director, and terrific writing.  Thankfully, all of these components were achieved, and the WB presented audiences with the best Batman movie ever, and kick-started a new `Batman' franchise.  With director Christopher Nolan's success with his sleeper hit \\"Memento\\" and the crime drama \\"Insomnia\\", there wasn't much doubt that he could handle the dramatic aspects of the character, but what worried fans was that since he had never helmed a big budget movie before, especially one featuring a character with so much history from the comics, tv, and the previous franchise that spanned from 1989 to 1997, would Christopher Nolan drop the ball in bringing the Dark Knight backto cinematic life.  Fans worries were quickly laid to rest when writer David Goyer (writer of \\"The Crow: City of Angels\\", \\"Blade\\", \\"Blade 2\\", and \\"Blade: Trinity\\") came on board to pen the screenplay with the assistance of  Christopher Nolan.  Then with A-list casting choices being made, featuring the likes of Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, and Katie Holmes, this film was definitely shaping up to be the blockbuster success that would be needed to do both Batman justice, and to begin a new franchise. <br /> <br />Terrific writing, acting, and directing brought Batman back from the pits of movie hell and back onto the big screen.  With \\"Batman Begins\\" movie audiences finally learned how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and hope that future installments will continue to build on what was started here, and a great new `Batman' franchise will begin.  Don't get me wrong, the original `Batman' franchise was terrific for the most part, but based on \\"Batman Begins\\", this new franchise looks to take the Dark Knight's success to even greater heights. <br /> <br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and minor sensuality.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I absolutly LOVE this album!!! For those of you who were caught up in the emotional moments throughout the movie, you'll love this album too. You can picture what was happening in the movie at the moment of the song. And the singing is unmatched. I am a lover of music and I absolutety loved the singing. It was bold and AMAZING!!  If you saw the movie then you should DEFINENTLY buy this album. It has everything on it that you could possibly want!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|In Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, we got to see the title character onscreen and in action within the first ten minutes of the film.  However in Batman Begins, Director Christopher builds the story slowly.  We are a nearly a full hour into the 140 minute film before we see the Caped Crusader for the first time.  This would not be the only contrast in this latest, and best Batman film.  What sets this film apart from any of the previous Batman films is the depth of character development not of the Batman character, but of the Bruce Wayne character.  By the time Joel Schumacher came out with his awful \\"Batman & Robin\\" the character of Bruce Wayne was nearly lost among a host of heroes, villains, and campy silliness.  Credit Christopher Nolan for taking Batman and Bruce Wayne serious.<br /><br />For the first time we really get a sense of what drives and motivates Bruce Wayne to become Batman.  Comic fans have known this for years but this was never conveyed with any skill or intensity in the previous films.  Here we see a man who has gone into seclusion, far from the rest of the world due to his inability to cope with his own fears and guilt over the murder of his parents years earlier.  Wayne is tutored under than hand of Ra's Ah Ghul a mysterious figure from comic lore, who trains ninjas to carry out their own brand of justice.  Wayne's difference of opinion with the oriental war lords tactics lead to a violent confrontation as Wayne escapes the mountain stronghold and returns to Gotham to find he'd been declared dead and that Gotham is infested more than ever with crime, led by organized crime boss Carmine Falcone.  Wayne is reunited with loyal butler Alfred played magnificently by Michael Caine.  Caine's Alfred is a more hands on character than we've seen in previous films, aiding Bruce in the development of the Batcave in tunnels found underneath Wayne Manor.<br /><br />Wayne also is aided by Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman) the head of R & D at Wayne Industries.  Jack Nicholson asked in the first movie, \\"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\\"  Well the answer is from Lucious Fox who developed the body army, memory fabric cape, weapons, and the new Batmobile referred to as \\"The Tumbler\\".  He's kind of like Batman's \\"Q\\", and provides some much needed detail and backstory.  I mean even stalwart comic fans have always wondered if Batman came up with all this stuff on his own.  There's a great tip of the cap to Bob Kane's original Batman origin when Wayne encounters the bats in the caves and overcomes his fears and realizes that the bat is an image that will strike fear into criminals.  It's these little touches that make this movie so good.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is superb, too.  Gary Oldman plays an uncharacteristic normal and good guy role as office Jim Gordon, before he would become Commissioner Gordon as the lone honest cop that Batman trusts to aid him.  This very much stays with the canon created in the Batman Year One story by Frank Miller.  Cillian Murphy of \\"28 Days Later\\" is Dr. Jonathan Crane, a psychiatrist in charge of Arkham Asylum who also takes on the guise of Scarecrow, using a powdered drug to induce fear and psychosis into those who breathe in the drug.  Murphy fits the gangly scarecrow character very well.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has contrasted the comic look of Schumacher and the Gothic/Art Deco look of Burton to present Gotham has a gritty, dirty, slimy cesspool, overrun by the criminal element and desperately calling out for rescue.  Lets also give kudos to the cinematography of  Simon Margetts and Wally Pfister.  The scenery was just gorgeous.  In the final summation this is really Christian Bale's movie.  He is Bruce Wayne.  He comes the closest by far, of playing the character the way he's always been depicted in comics for over 65 years.  We can only hope that Warner will continue to let this creative group continue to handle the Batman franchise.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonck Nicholson asked in the first movie, \\"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\\"  Well the answer is from Lucious Fox who developed the body army, memory fabric cape, weapons, and the new Batmobile referred to as \\"The Tumbler\\".

0312995423|3.0|This was the first book I read from Brown and since I work in technology I found it to be very entertaining.  The techno-jargon wasn't too overwhelming so it shouldn't intimidate the layman.  I would recommend it.    Anthony Wilbon, Author of \\"The Enigma of Njama\\"
0060506989|5.0|Being known as, \\"Ia Drang - The Battle that changed the War in Vietnam,\\" We Were Soldiers Once. . . And Young is on of the best action/war novels of its time. Unlike most authors, Lieutenant Colonel Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway make this book accurate in many ways. They didn't have to do research or ask the young men who have lived to tell about those three horrible days, they were both there, right in the middle of it. In the beginning, a French patrol in South Vietnam was killed. In the years to come, the United States stated to send troops in to help push back the invading north. Then in November of 1965, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Moore, were drooped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang valley. The troops were the surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese troops. What happens next? Do the men survive the next 3 horrible day's? <br /> <br /> Well, you'll have to read the book to find out more. This is a must-read book if you don't want to read inaccurate accounts on what really happened on that November day. But if you have a weak stomach, DO NOT READ this book because it goes into great detail of the wounds that some of the men have received during this battle and all the blood it also talks about. So if you are tired of reading poorly written war books that don't tell the truth about what really happens, then you should read, We Were Soldiers Once. . . And Young.  <br />
B00006GA48|5.0|Grand Funk Railroad has gotten a bad rap for being too simple and predictable.  Well, what some call simple, others call raw and pure.  Pump up the volume and rip off the knob for \\"Sin's a Good Man's Brother\\". But kick back and let \\"I'm Your Captain\\" (a soldier's lament to the Vietnam war) take you back to the 1970's where true classic rock lived and bands used REAL orchestral arrangements! This disc will bring back a flood of memories for some us older rockers and introduce young, headbangers to, ahem, their parents music. Yes. It's that important.
B000001ES9|4.0|Hmmh, album with rock and funny-like melodics... sounds good! <br />Yeah, it totally sounds good and funny because this is something what Rush have never ever been! Zep-like melodys doesn't make you sad, but it will make you think that what could happened if John Rutsey (Rush's first drummer, only in this album) continued with the band! <br /> <br />I dont think that this is not worth of five stars, this isn't progressive, this isn't so \\"Rush\\", this isn't so mindkeeping album, but this has classic songs like Working Man and Finding My Way!  <br /> <br />But still this is not Rush. This is something else... Zepush?
B00009UW0N|5.0|John Carpenter's Halloween is the horror film that started the slasher genre.Although none of the other slasher films have been able to surpass Halloween.<br /><br />The acting is great in this film since we have Jamie Lee Curtis,Charles Cyphers,Nancy Loomis,Donald Pleasance & PJ Soles.The film is very frightening & this film showed us that it's not about blood, it's about the suspence.<br /><br />This is the movie you should choose to watch on Halloween night because it's The One,The Only, The Classic Halloween!<br /><br />I recommend this to any horror fan.It's the best horror movie you can find.
B00005MP58|3.0|I agree 100% with Wait for Extra Special Edition.  I, too, owned the VHS version and was sadly disappointed by both the color and the sound quality of the DVD version.  I feel that those of us who paid the bucks for this \\"special edition\\" should get a remastered one with the problems corrected.  I have no complaints at all about the content.  Wonderful story, faithfully told.  Great casting, acting, filming.  The book is wonderfully captured on film, but then miserably translated to DVD.  Had the DVDs had the same color and sound as the VHS, I would have given it 5 stars.  Bad, bad job, BBC!

1400032717|3.0|I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. I always thought of it as an Oprah book, which I guess is not true, but the copy I was given does have a Today's Book Club logo printed on to the actual cover. It has a really terrific, hooky beginning, and Christopher's voice is consistent and believable. My problem with it is this: Although I loved the plot of the second half of the book and the descriptions of Christopher on the busses and trains, I found some major plot points were forced/not worked out as well as I thought they needed to be. Plus it was almost too quick of a read. That being said, some of the writing when Christopher is just musing on stuff is downright poetic, like the scene where he's saying how constellations are just silly and arbitrary, and how the stars are just nuclear explosions millions of miles away. I'd be excited to see if his next book is a little more ambitious; he probably has the talent to pull it off.

0385486804|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It gave me a lot of insight into why Jon Krakauer wrote both this and \\"Into Thin Air.\\"  Krakauer spends two chapters talking about his own Alaskan adventure where he nearly died.  So it shouldn't be surprizing that he takes a sympathetic view of Chris McCandless and his fatal Alaskan trek. <br /> <br />He also delves into history and writes about other people who have died as they tried to get closer to nature, or were just plain ill-prepared for what they got themselves into, not giving Mother Nature the respects she demands, sometimes at the price of our lives. <br /> <br />My favorite part was toward the end where he critiques his own \\"Outdoor\\" magazine article about McCandless and talks about where he was wrong, and then suggests how he thinks McCandless actually died. <br /> <br />In depth and facinating.  Worth the read.  I loved it and I don't usually read nature-y type books.

B000B2YQX4|4.0|Having been a Depeche Mode fan since their early 80s synth pop days, I liken the band to fine wine; mellowing with age without losing its distinct passion and excitement. \\"Playing The Angel\\" isn't the band's best effort, but it is still a great album in terms of production. Dave Gahan has traded in his gothy barotone for a loungy, soulful voice; Martin's lyrics and melodies are vintage DM...focusing on the human condition and all its frailties. I won't rate individual songs on the album, but the one that truly deserves its place as a DM classic has to be \\"Precious.\\" When I first heard the song I was amazed by its haunting melody. Then, when I found out what inspired Martin to write the song (about divorcing his wife and its impact on their child) I was saddened. Still, I think \\"Violator\\" is DM's crowning achievement, with \\"Music For The Masses\\" and \\"Black Celebration\\" not far behind. PTA is a very good album, showing Depeche Mode's creative fire has not gone out...even after twenty-five years and counting.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Wow, that's all I can say. I love this c.d. they are such a good and appropriate mix of electronica, rock, emo, and show true emotions through their lyrics. I first got the oppritunity to see Panic! at the Nintendo Fusion tour on September 27th, in Detroit, Michigan. They were the highlight of the show. It was their c.d. release party and they played absolutely phenominal. They work the crowd and kept their true sound live. I would definitely recommend this band to anyone who likes motion city soundtrack, new reggie and the full effect, or fall out boy.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I love Star Wars. I grew up with the original on VHS. The quality of this DVD, compared to the VHS, is amazing. I can't get over how smooth everything looks, not at all grainy and gritty like the original VHS, which wore down over repeated use. However, I don't like how they messed with it, inserting Hayden Christiansen at the end. It was amazing the way you did it, DON'T MESS WITH IT! When I first saw it, I couldn't believe my eyes. It takes away from the original. They should have left the original character as the gohst of Aniken! Other than that, it's a good buy. I enjoy re-watching all the movies, without that wear-and-tear on the CD.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|First off whoever you are, Martin Gore did not write all the songs on this album. If you opened the CD and read the credits, you'd see that Gahan wrote tracks 3, 7, and 8. And to Gahans credit, I was pleasantly suprised that these tracks contribute perfectly to this great album. I guess years of being in the studio with Gore rubbed off on David, and he wrote 3 amazing songs for Playing the Angel. <br /> <br />Secondly, some DM fans, myself included happen to enjoy Gore's ballad's, and both 'Macrovision' and 'Damaged People' add to Gore's catalog of unique, dark and beautifully honest lyrical masterpieces. Show tune? Please. This isn't New Order, it isn't all about techno dance beats. This is Depeche Mode and you sir are a uninformed jackass. <br /> <br />Lastly, the only weak track on Playing the Angel in my opinion is 'Lillian'. I find it boring and lyrically boring (\\"oh Lillian, I need protection!\\" stupid...). Other than that I have no complaints, Playing the Angel is a masterpiece to go along with so many other albums by DM. <br /> <br />I was doubtful that this would be as good as past albums considering Gahan getting in on the song writing for the first time, but like I said earlier, Gahan writes 3 very different sounding songs while maintaining the DM theme and keeping in tune with the rest of this kickass album.

I didn't even know that it was pulled off the air until I read it somewhere, a month after the fact.<br /><br />This DVD is everything I expected. It's great to see all the episodes without commercial breaks, and in order! The story is great, with many undercurrents and character developments. The DVD with all the extras was fun to watch also. I would definetly recommend this DVD series!

B00095MLGC|4.0|I've read lots of reviews on this band, mostly positive. Many of the negative ones compare Porcupine Tree unfavorably, to Pink Floyd. Admittedly, I own just 3 \\"Tree\\" albums (\\"Deadwing\\", \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Up The Downstair\\") and have only been a fan for about 2 years, but the \\"Floyd\\" comparison is short-sighted. As a 46 year old rock n'roll drummer myself, I grew up listening to Floyd and there's no doubt they were an excellent band. In some \\"Tree\\" songs I can hear a Pink Floyd influence, but I also hear early, Peter Gabriel-led Genesis, Phish and various fusion jazz bands. The point is that every band has been influenced by another on some level. Songs such as \\"Always Never\\" and \\"Synesthesia\\" from \\"Up The Downstair\\", like many other songs on this record, are very different in terms of tempo, style and range. Therefore, I don't fully understand the Pink Floyd comparisons. The musicians who make up Porcupine Tree are outstanding in their own right. The song writing is excellent and as a drummer myself, I can say the drummer in \\"Tree\\" is unconscious. <br /> <br />Fortunately for fans, Porcupine Tree is still playing in relatively small venues, particularly here in Colorado, but I fear it won't last long. This is a great band who will continue to get noticed. I can't wait to here more of their music.

B0009JAENU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed these Mozart sonatas by Hahn and Zhu, and hope this is just the beginning of an exploration of the violin sonata by this duo, who obviously have a very sympathetic rapport. In fact, it would be wonderful if they found a compatible cellist so they could explore some of the great piano trio literature. Simply a beautiful recording.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold's novel The Lovely Bones is a novel that is worth taking the time out to read.   It is a novel that gets your attention with the first line of the book.   \\"My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie.  I was fourteen when I was murdered December 6, 1973.\\"    With its interesting beginning it is sure to get the readers hooked.  As I first started to read the book I became extremely engaged and it was hard to put down. <br /> The book is based on a murder of a young little girl in which she is watching down from heaven as the people on earth try to solve her murder.  Susie, the main character sees everything that is going on earth as though she was watching a movie.  It is an interesting point of view which is not seen often in books and this view brings the book its unique style that is hard to capture. <br /> The book overall is really hard to put down and brings some interesting plots that have you reading page after page.  You get really attached to the main character and the other characters as well.  It feels that you're in the position of Susie and at points in the book you too feel like shouting things to the people down at heaven.  To me this was a good book that I will recommend to a friend.  This book to me was recommended by a friend and I'm glad he did and now I highly recommend this book to you. <br />
B00005JM20|4.0|Being an avid fan of Rowan Atkinson, it was with great anticipation that I saw this movie. I was very interested to see how Atkinson would cope in a full-length feature role that was not Mr Bean.<br /><br />The character of Johnny English seems to share a lot of the traits of Bean, with the slapstick comedy and so on. Also, like Bean, English has moments of brilliance where he gains some small victory over the circumstances he is placed in. However, there is enough originality in English as a character to make him something new and not just a carbon-copy of Bean in a suit with a gun.<br /><br />John Malkovich puts in a fine showing as the villianous French guy with designs on the crown and throne of England. Actually, I was really impressed at how genuine he sounded with his French accent, (though I am sure some French people simply cringed!).<br /><br />While the movie is not going to go down in history as a classic and all-time great, it is certainly a great way to have a laugh or two. I had a ball watching this movie, and recommend it for anyone wanting a light laugh and a good solid dose of it.
B0000025T6|5.0|This is the kind of album that could never make the modernized <br />leap to a CD.  Selections from the album, along with several <br />from the Ghost of Tom Joad, show the quiet, acoustical, hymn <br />for the under-trodden side of Bruce.  An out of the mainstream testament.
B000AA305M|1.0|I listened to a few songs that a friend downloaded for free off the Internet. It sounded fantastic. I was going to buy the cd until I saw it was copy protected. I won't buy copy protected cds. It's a shame because the songs are really great and this seems to be an artist I can really get into. Oh well.
B000AU9UYC|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but I was largely ambivalent about the first half, and then the second half just went to the crapper (only saving part was some dignity in the last 5 minutes).  Where to begin?  The League of Shadows.  What was the deal with that??  They bring down bloated or decaying empires, yeah, nice gimmic, geez.  Why do they even seek and train Bruce Wayne, they do what they want without him anyways.  And what is with Liam Nielson knowing EVERYTHING about his environment, even about soft ice patches and falling, flaming posts, does he have ESP?  Then there is Bale, who is as stiff as a board. And his love interest, who has the face of a 12 yr. old, and the two have ZERO chemistry (there isn't even an intimate scene between them).  Compare this to Maguire and Dunst in Spiderman, who rule together.  And then there is the whole story, what a mess!  Why on earth would the toxin be mixed with the drugs, then seperated, then put in the water, but then have to be vaporized by a super whizz-bang microwaverator.  Idiotic.  <br />And what about that clown spraying gas in the freaky mask?  First he's a lawyer, then he's a psychiatrist?  And for all the background in the first half of the movie, we really learn nothing about Bruce, except that he's scared of bats.  Big whoop. And everytime batman talks, it's so husky and deep one can hardly understand it, as he growls and shows his teeth like a dog.  What's with that?  This movie is too dark.  It steals <br />lines, scenes and ideas from the original batman shamelessly, but to less or zero effect.  The second half moves jumbled and confused and there is no fun nor depth nor anything of value.  When they set up a sequel in the final minutes, i could have laughed, who cares!  And the freaking action sequences, one can't see sh#%!  And all those bats flying in at the climax, whatever.  Some suspension <br />of rationality is required in the comic genre, but this movie goes from serious to ridiculous back and forth that it ends up a blended mess.  Oh yeah, and then Morgan Freeman is in the basement cookin' up the medicine, finding an antidote lickedy-split.  Whatever.  As Chaz Palmieri says in Bullets over Broadway, this movie \\"stinks on hot ice\\".  Nick would have <br />killed someone over this production as well.
